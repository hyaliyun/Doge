He was a popular figure in all parties and had potential to be a front-runner for the party leadership had he not been killed in a car accident. In 2014 a Crowdfunder campaign was launched to record his life's work and impact. Background Penhaligon was born on D-Day and brought up in Truro. He was a cousin of actress Susan Penhaligon.\\"Cornish actress Susan Penhaligon quits Lib Dems over reforms\\", Western Morning News, 6 April 2013 . Accessed 18 March 2015 He attended Truro School, and then Cornwall Technical College where he studied mechanical engineering. Penhaligon worked for Holman Brothers in Camborne as a research and development engineer working on rock drilling. As an interesting anecdote, he was also a part-time DJ at the Hall for Cornwall where he once encountered 14 year old Roger Taylor, subsequently the Queen drummer, at a musical event that he compered in Truro City Hall during 1964.http://www.artcornwall.org/features/Roger_Taylors_Truro.htm By 1973 he had qualified as a Chartered Mechanical Engineer; he also took over from his father a sub-post office in Chacewater from 1967 (after his marriage in 1968 to Annette Lidgey, she ran the business). His Liberal activities led to some work in local broadcasting. Penhaligon's decision to join the Liberal Party was inspired in 1963 when, aged 19, he was an important witness to a murder case.\\"Constantine murder which left the county shocked 50 years ago\\", West Briton, 4 January 2014 Accessed 18 March 2015 His evidence, which supported the case of the defendant Dennis Whitty, was not enough to prevent him from being convicted and hanged. Penhaligon was appalled by the practice of capital punishment. He led the Truro Young Liberals and built up the local party (which had been the weakest in Cornwall) into one of the strongest; he was the chair of the Cornish Young Liberals from 1966 to 1968. However he was not selected as Liberal candidate for Truro in the 1966 general election (nor for any other seat), and he was also rejected for Falmouth and Camborne in 1968 apparently because his strong Cornish accent was thought unattractive. In the 1970 general election he fought the Devon constituency of Totnes when the previous candidate Paul Tyler transferred to Bodmin. He polled poorly in the context of an election in which the party as a whole suffered. However, Penhaligon had acquired useful experience of fighting election campaigns and picked up additional tips from Wallace Lawler's practices in inner-city Birmingham. Campaigning in Truro In 1971 Penhaligon was easily selected as candidate for Truro, a seat which did not look an easier prospect than Totnes. This gave him three years in which to get his name known and meet his prospective constituents (a practice known as 'nursing' a constituency) and when the election came in February 1974 he won nearly 21,000 votes and cut the majority of the sitting Conservative MP to 2,561. Truro became the fourth 'target' constituency for the Liberals for the next election ‚Äî which would take place within months because of the inconclusive outcome in February. Parliamentary activity Penhaligon was readopted and worked on trying to persuade the remaining Labour voters in the seat to back him. In the October 1974 election he was elected with a majority of 464 votes ‚Äì the only Liberal gain of that election. Due to House of Commons rules on 'offices of profit under the crown' he transferred his sub-postmastership to his wife. In Parliament he swiftly won a reputation for humorous speeches, urging a national minimum wage and increased state pensions. He voted for fellow Cornish MP John Pardoe over David Steel in the Liberal leadership election of 1976. He was hard to place in conventional political terms: he changed his mind over capital punishment, initially voting against in December 1974,Division 32. Hansard , HC 5ser vol 883 col 639. but supporting it in December 1975.Division 15. Hansard , HC 5ser vol 902 col 723. Although frequently speaking on national issues, it was clear that Penhaligon's main concern was local. He became known in particular for defending the Cornish tin mining industry and the local Fishing fleets. He spoke with conviction and knowledge about the problems of rural areas in Cornwall with road fuel costs and inadequate infrastructure. Tourism, ice cream and deckchairs In a speech made at Camborne in support of the miners he famously said... Lib-Lab pact When the Lib-Lab pact was first mooted in March 1977, Penhaligon was initially opposed and spoke against it. He later came round and told the Liberal Assembly in September 1977 that it had achieved an 'economic revolution'. At a special Assembly in January 1978 he was a star speaker in persuading the delegates representing Liberal members to continue the pact. The pact allowed the Liberals to influence government legislation and Penhaligon objected to proposals from Tony Benn for an Electricity Industry Bill which would centralise control, which single-handedly prevented any progress. Part of Penhaligon's support for the Lib-Lab pact was his fear that an early general election would result in a poor performance for the Liberals, and his own seat might be vulnerable. In October 1978 after the pact had lapsed, he explained that \\"Turkeys don't volunteer for Christmas!\\". The scandal over former party leader Jeremy Thorpe, who was charged with conspiracy to murder in August 1978, was a matter of particular concern and Penhaligon urged Thorpe to stand down and the Liberal Party not to endorse him. When Thorpe did seek re-election, Penhaligon refused to help his campaign. Despite his narrow majority and the belief that he was the most vulnerable of the Liberal MPs, Penhaligon kept his seat with a much larger majority (8,708) in the 1979 general election. Against the Conservative government, he strongly opposed nuclear power. Against the majority of Liberal Party members he strongly supported NATO and nuclear weapons, describing a separate European non-nuclear defence as 'akin to a behaving like a virgin in a brothel', although he supported demands for 'dual key control' of United States cruise missiles based in Britain. In the Alliance Penhaligon supported the SDP-Liberal Alliance from the start, although he resented SDP attempts to take control of the Liberal Party's target seats. He was named in January 1982 as one of the 'firemen' who would sort out any disagreements between the parties (John Horam was his SDP counterpart). He was particularly prominent and impressive in the 1983 election campaign in which he spoke for the Liberal Party on Transport, Industry and Energy; Hugo Young described him as having \\"a closer grasp of national electoral politics ... than any other Liberal MP\\". After the election he became an early proponent of a merger between the SDP and the Liberals under a single leader, largely to avoid disputes over allocations of Parliamentary seats. Career cut short From 1983 Penhaligon headed the Liberal by-election unit which planned the campaigns in individual seats. At the Liberal Assembly in September 1984 he was chosen as President-elect of the Liberal Party (the first sitting MP to be elected to the post), and served as Party President from 1985 to 1986. This carried with it the job of presiding over the Liberal Assembly at the end of his term, which saw a party split over defence policy and whether to support nuclear weapons; Penhaligon did not intervene, something he regretted afterwards. He was appointed as Chief spokesman on the economy in 1985; though admitting he had no financial experience, he challenged the Conservative policy on privatisation and monetarism. He was a central figure in planning the Alliance general election campaign at the time of his death. At 6.45am on 22 December 1986, he was travelling to a post office to meet workers there when a van skidded on an icy road and hit his Rover SD1 car near Truck Fork, Probus, Cornwall. Penhaligon was pronounced dead at the scene.\\"Tributes pour in for Penhaligon\\", Glasgow Herald, 23 December 1986. Accessed 18 March 2015 The van driver was not prosecuted for the accident. The inquest held in March 1987 strongly suggested that Penhaligon was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash, nor was the driver of the van, who was thrown out of his vehicle and suffered two broken legs as a result. Penhaligon's injuries were extensive fracture of his ribs and fracture of the neck vertebrae. The cause of death was damage to the aorta as well as massive damage to the spleen and liver. From July 1986, Penhaligon had employed Matthew Taylor, a University of Oxford graduate, as his research assistant on the economy; Taylor was selected to follow him as Liberal candidate for Truro and was duly returned in the 1987 Truro by-election. Penhaligon's widow wrote his biography in 1989; his son Matthew has previously been an active member of the Liberal Democrats and was the party's candidate for the Mayoralty of Hackney in May 2006.Mayoral and council elections 4 May 2006 ‚Äì Election for Mayor of Hackney Penhaligon Award The Liberal Democrats remember Penhaligon's ability to recruit and enthuse members through the Penhaligon Award, a trophy presented annually at the party's autumn party conference to the Local Party which demonstrates the greatest increase in party membership together with activities to develop and involve members and activists.

Initiated in Spring 2004, its objectives include the generation of new ideas for development and to deliver implementation of existing international commitments towards Africa. African leaders form a majority of the 17 commissioners. The report of the Commission was released in March 2005. The publication was welcomed by international agencies, who also urged caution. \\"The proof of the Africa Commission‚Äôs worth will be in the political will and energy it manages to drum up to turn its recommendations into reality,\\" said a spokesperson for Oxfam. The Commission and its report had a clear impact upon the public debate in the UK, and to some extent elsewhere, on how development in Africa might be accelerated. At the G8 summit of world leaders in Gleneagles, Scotland that year, the report was seen as a blueprint for action by the G8. The Gleneagles summit pledged what the Commission report had asked for in terms of a doubling of aid and significant extensions of multilateral debt relief. But it failed to deliver what the Commission had demanded on trade ‚Äì including an end to agricultural export subsidies by rich nations and end to 'reciprocity' in world trade negotiations. The summit did, however, promise to implement 50 of the Commission's 90 recommendations including: $36bn of debt relief in 100% debt cancellation delivered for 19 countries; the launch of the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF); doubling previous levels of aid for basic education, to remove school fees, and to scale up efforts to boost girls‚Äô participation and female literacy; two million additional Africans given antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS; immunisation programmes which have stopped the transmission of polio everywhere except Nigeria; training 20,000 more African peacekeepers; tightening controls on the trade in small arms; working more closely with the African Union and its New Partnership for Africa (Nepad) programme to make African governments more accountable to their people; pressing rich nations to ratify the UN Convention on Corruption; putting in place measures to return cash looted by dictators from Western banks to the legitimate owners; and using export credits to clamp down on Western companies who pay bribes. After the summit however the profile of the report faded but it clearly had a major impact on the delivery of policy, though it is not clear whether all the Commission recommendations which were pledged at Gleneagles will be fully implemented. In April 2007, the Africa Progress Panel (APP) was launched as an independent authority on Africa to focus world leaders' attention on delivering their commitments to the continent. The Panel, chaired by Kofi Annan, is composed of Michel Camdessus, Peter Eigen, Bob Geldof, Gra√ßa Machel, Strive Masiyiwa, Linah Mohohlo, Robert Rubin, and Tidjane Thiam. On 13 September 2010, the Commission launched a second report, Still Our Common Interest, looking at what had happened since the last report ‚Äì both in Africa and against the individual recommendations made in 2005. It found that, despite considerable progress towards the Millennium Development Goals in many African countries, Africa's economic success over the preceding five years had yet to be translated into economic benefits for the majority of Africans. The report noted that there had been progress against many of the recommendations, but very little movement in the area of trade reform, in particular. It made new recommendations on how to ensure that the promise of Africa's accelerated economic growth was converted into development across the sub-Saharan African region. It called on African countries to continue reforms that would make it easier to invest and do business and on African governments to fulfill their commitments to spending on health, education, water, sanitation and infrastructure. It called for continued and expanding aid from developed countries, but reiterated the importance of making progress on increasing Africa's share of global trade. It is stated that one per cent of global trade is worth $195 billion to Africa in 2009 ‚Äì five times the amount it received in aid.

A 2005 survey rated Exeter as the best example of a clone town in the UK. Clone town is a global term for a town where the High Street or other major shopping areas are significantly dominated by chain stores. The term was coined by the New Economics Foundation (NEF), a British think tank, in the 2004 report on \\"Clone Town Britain\\". A survey conducted by the NEF in 2005 estimated that 41% of towns in the UK and 48% of London villages could be considered clone towns, with the trend rising. Controversy The NEF report argued that the spread of clone towns is highly damaging to society because of the removal of diversity: * Small businesses lost out to larger chains. Between 1997 and 2002, independent general stores were estimated to close at the rate of one per day, and specialist stores at the rate of 50 per week; customers chose to shop elsewhere. * Consolidation of large amounts of distribution power in the hands of these companies might lead to danger. For example, magazine editors lobbied the Prime Minister to act to prevent a situation in which a few supermarket brands could control the distribution of magazines and thus effectively censor any publication that they did not like or even force it out of business. The report also found that many suppliers, such as farmers, feared making any public criticism of chain retailers, as the retailer could simply cut their distribution and force them out of business. * Related to both of the above is the danger of the loss of regional colour. For example, the NEF report found that many supermarket branches in Scotland did not carry, or did not stock, regional Scottish publications. * The tendency for chain stores and, in particular, supermarkets to locate out of town means that they purchase land that could have been used for housing and thus drive up housing prices since less land is available. * Chain stores and especially supermarkets tend to carry only the few most popular products in certain ranges (for example, the most popular computer games, books and DVDs). Thus, they reduce the range of choice available and remove the most profitable business upon which companies offering greater choice would depend The converse argument is that large chain stores have grown so big because their products are desirable to large numbers of people and so their arrival in towns provides convenient access to the products that the population might want. It is argued that providing locals with easy access to popular products that they want should be a higher priority than ensuring that people travelling between multiple towns experience variety. Furthermore, because they are wealthy, businesses they are more likely to consume much local services and to employ local people, thus energising the local economy. The NEF report also notes that the creation of chain stores and supermarkets has been in part a response to the consolidation of retail land ownership in the UK. Retailers are forced to consolidate to have any leverage over landlords that have already consolidated. Other commentators have raised concerns regarding the loss of \\"sociability\\" offered by traditional shopping: \\"the demise of the small shop would mean that people will not just be disadvantaged in their role as consumers but also as members of communities ‚Äì the erosion of small shops is viewed as the erosion of the 'social glue' that binds communities together, entrenching social exclusion in the UK\\". Examples The 2005 survey rated Exeter as the best example of a clone town in the UK, with only a single independent store in the city's high street and less diversity (in terms of different categories of shop) than any other town surveyed. Other extreme clone towns in England include Stafford, Middlesbrough, Weston-super-Mare and Winchester. Although not included in the NEF survey, many provincial towns in Scotland are considered to have similar characteristics. Notably, despite having the highest property prices in the country, London is not even close to becoming a clone town: even in the central areas of the city, a huge diversity of businesses exists, largely as a result of the city's relatively large size and cosmopolitan population.

Jacob Summerlin (February 20, 1820 - November 4, 1893), aka the King of the Crackers and King of the Cracker Cow Hunters, was reputed to be the first child born in Florida after the land was ceded by Spain. He is known for his contributions to the early settlement of Florida, and especially for founding the county seats of Orange and Polk counties, which are Orlando and Bartow, respectively. In the years prior to the Civil War, he was a slaveowner. \\"King of the Crackers\\" Summerlin earned much of his early fortune raising cattle along the Peace River and Kissimmee River. Wild cattle brought to North America by the Spanish conquistadors roamed free across these vast stretches of land; entrepreneurs could capture, breed, drive and sell these cows for twelve to sixteen dollars each. Summerlin and his business partners developed a lucrative trade with Havana and with the US Naval Base at Key West. During the Civil War, he and his partners smuggled beef and medicine to Confederate troops past the Union blockade. With Confederate money he earned, he bought the 160-acre (0.65 km¬≤) Blount homestead, much of which would later be given to Polk County. (Ft. Blount was the earlier name of Bartow, the present county seat.) After the war, when Confederate money became worthless, he began selling cattle to the Union soldiers at Fort Myers. Jacob Summerlin He amassed a fortune of 15,000 to 20,000 head of cattle during this period, and was considered one of the wealthiest Floridians before he reached age 40. In this pre-banking era, Jacob kept his gold and silver at his cabin in trunks, meal sacks, tin meat cans, woolen socks, cigar boxes, behind door frames, in the rafters, or tossed in a corner. He used his wealth to purchase large tracts of land sprawling from Fort Meade to Fort Myers. He bought a wharf at Punta Rassa and a thousand acres (4 km¬≤) nearby for cow pens, some of which he rented to other cattlemen. Donations in Bartow and Orlando In 1867, he donated 120 acres (0.5 km¬≤) of the Blount homestead land in the present-day town of Bartow: for an institution of learning (aptly named the Summerlin Institute, now called Bartow High School, founded 1887), for establishment of a county seat, and for each of the town's two churches (Methodist and Baptist). He also personally donated $1100.00 for construction of Bartow's first two-story building which housed the Masonic lodge and school. Summerlin also owned land in Orange County where he opened the Summerlin Hotel. When Orlando's wooden courthouse burned in 1868, there was pressure to move the county seat to the then-larger town of Sanford. It had been located nearby in Enterprise across the river from Sanford before 1857. General Henry Sanford was particularly involved in lobbying for the move to Sanford and offered free land for the new courthouse during a public meeting of the County Commission in 1875. Summerlin sat in the packed audience during Sanford's offer. Legend has it that as Sanford finished speaking, Summerlin rose to his feet and asked if he was done, Sanford replied \\"I have\\". The county accepted his offer and repaid him over a 10-year period. Later that year, Orlando became incorporated with a population of 85; on August 4, Jacob Summerlin sat on the first Orlando City Council acting as Council president. It was also Summerlin who donated a large tract of land in order for a fine park to be established in Orlando. In 1883, Summerlin came to a city council meeting and offered the land around the lake on the condition that it be beautified and turned into a park. He also required that the city plant trees and put a \\"driveway\\" around the lake. To ensure that the city followed through the stipulations of the donation, Summerlin put reverter clauses in the contract to allow his heirs to reclaim the property if the city failed in its obligations. That park is still maintained to his orders of it being kept beautiful. His son Judge Robert L Summerlin, mayor of Orlando named Lake Eola Lake Eola, after a fiancee who died before they could marry. Jacob died on November 4, 1893, aged 73, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Bartow.

With about 260 permanent residents (2016 census), it is more populous than Inishmaan but less than Inishmore. Caomh√°n of Inis O√≠rr is the island's patron saint. There are five primary settlements on Inis O√≠rr, including Baile Thiar, Baile an tS√©ip√©il (Chapeltown), Baile an Chaisle√°in (Castle Village), Baile an Fhormna and Baile an Lorgain (Town of the shin-shaped hill). Naming The official name, , was brought into usage by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. It may be a compromise between the traditional local name and the previous official name .√ì Murch√∫ (S√©amas): An tainm √°ite Inis O√≠rr in √âigse 26 (1992), pp. 119‚Äì123. There is no Irish word corresponding to the second element in the official name. It seems from the annals that the island's name always contained the element or in the sense of \\"rear\\" or \\"back\\" island and not \\"west\\" as is the usual sense of this word. The form , used by the 17th century scholar Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Flaithbheartaigh, seems to have arisen out of his own misreading of the annals.http://www.folkworld.de/33/e/inisheer.html Geology and geography  The island is geologically an extension of The Burren. The terrain of the island is composed of limestone pavements with crisscrossing cracks known as \\"grikes\\", leaving isolated rocks called \\"clints\\". The limestones date from the Vis√©an period (Lower Carboniferous), formed as sediments in a tropical sea approximately 350 million years ago, and compressed into horizontal strata with fossil corals, crinoids, sea urchins and ammonites. Glaciation following the Namurian phase facilitated greater denudation. The result is that Inisheer is one of the finest examples of a Glacio-Karst landscape in the world. The effects of the last glacial period (the Midlandian) are most in evidence, with the island overrun by ice during this glaciation. The impact of earlier Karstification (solutional erosion) has been eliminated by the last glacial period, so any Karstification now seen dates from approximately 10,000 years ago and the island Karst is thus recent. Solutional processes have widened and deepened the grykes of the limestone pavement. Pre-existing lines of weakness in the rock (vertical joints) contribute to the formation of extensive fissures separated by clints (flat pavement like slabs). The rock karstification facilitates the formation of sub-terrainean drainage. Climate and agriculture The island has a temperate climate. Average air temperatures range from 15 ¬∞C (59 ¬∞F) in July to 6 ¬∞C (43 ¬∞F) in January. The soil temperature does not usually drop below 6 ¬∞C (43 ¬∞F). Since grass will grow once the temperature rises above 6 ¬∞C (43 ¬∞F), this means that the island (like the neighbouring Burren) has one of the longest growing seasons in Ireland, and supports diverse and rich plant growth. Late May is the sunniest time, and also likely the best time to view flowers, with the gentians and avens peaking (but orchid species blooming later). Flora and fauna The island supports arctic, Mediterranean and alpine plants side-by-side, due to the unusual environment. Like the Burren, the Aran islands are known for their remarkable assemblage of plants and animals. The grikes (crevices) provide moist shelter, thus supporting a wide range of plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the pavement is shattered into gravel, many of the hardier Arctic or Alpine plants can be found. But when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil, patches of grass are seen, interspersed with plants like the gentian and orchids. Notable insects present include the butterfly the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and wood white (Leptidea sinapis); the moths, the burren green (Calamia tridens), Irish annulet (Gnophos dumetata) and transparent burnet (Zygaena purpuralis); and the hoverfly Doros profuges. History In 1885 a burial site called Cnoc Raithn√≠ was discovered which dates back to 1500 BC. This is earliest evidence of human settlement of the island.http://www.aranislands.ie/cnoc-raithni/ Saint Caomh√°n, the patron saint of Inisheer, according to some traditions, was the elder brother of Kevin of Glendalough. The ruins of Teampall Chaomh√°in have to be uncovered annually as the floor of it is well below the level of the sand. In the Middle Ages, the island was ruled by the O'Brien dynasty who provided most of the Kings of Thomond. This rule was exercised since before the Anglo-Irish settled in Connacht in the 1230s. The Tribes of Galway paid the O'Briens an annual tribute of twelve tuns of wine \\"in consideration of their protection and expenses in guarding the bay and harbour of Galway against pirates and coast plunderers.\\" The remains of the 14th-century 'O'Brien's Castle' is sited near the island's highest point. In 1582 the O'Flahertys of Connemara captured it. Today O'Flahertys still live on the island. In 1652 it was given to the Cromwellian invasion force and the O'Flaherty's were defeated. They saw no use for it and the castle was partially dismantled, it has been unoccupied since.https://doolinferry.com/aran-island-ferries/inis-oirr/obriens- castle/http://aranislands.galway-ireland.ie/obriens-castle.htm The PMV Plassey shipwreck The cargo vessel Plassey was shipwrecked off Inis O√≠rr on 8 March 1960, and has since been thrown above high tide mark at Carraig na Finise on the island by strong Atlantic waves. The ship features in the opening credits of the TV Show Father Ted. A group of local Islanders, the Inisheer Rocket Crew, rescued the entire crew from the stricken vessel using a breeches buoy; an event captured in a pictorial display at the National Maritime Museum in D√∫n Laoghaire. Inisheer Lighthouse located at the southern tip of the island, it was completed in 1857. =Antiquities= The following sites on the island are designated as National Monuments: *Creggankeel Fort (NM 41.01) *Grave of the Seven Daughters (NM 41.02) *St. Gobnet's Church (NM 41.05) *Cnoc Raithn√≠ (NM 41.06) *O'Brien's Castle (NM 41.07) *St. Cavan's Church (NM 41.08) = Demographics = The table below reports data on Inis O√≠rr's population taken from Discover the Islands of Ireland (Alex Ritsema, Collins Press, 1999) and the Census of Ireland. Census data in Ireland before 1841 are not considered complete and/or reliable. Transport The island is reached by ferry from Rossaveal in Connemara and Doolin in County Clare as well as from the other Aran Islands. There is also a regional airport on each island which is served from Connemara Regional Airport by AerArann. A pier was opened in Doolin in June 2015 for commercial ferries serving the island. Islanders travel by foot or car around the island. Tourists can avail of tours/taxi trips by horse and trap. Members of An Garda S√≠och√°na patrol on bike. Language Irish is still today the daily language of the 260 permanent residents. In addition, many school pupils from the mainland come to the island to learn Irish in an environment where it is a living language in the local college, Col√°iste Laicht√≠n during the months of June, July and August. Sport Some of the limestone sea cliffs have attracted interest from rock-climbers, though the bigger islands of Inis M√≥r and Inis M√©ain are more popular. Diving is possible. In the media The island gained some television exposure in the 1990s when it (and 'An Plassy') appeared in the opening credits of the sitcom Father Ted masquerading as the fictional Craggy Island. Inis O√≠rr is mentioned in the song \\"The Return of Pan\\" by the band The Waterboys. Inisheer is also the name of a well known slow air written by Thomas Walsh from Dublin, after a visit to the island in the 1970s.Thoman Walsh, irishtunecomposers.weebly.com, retrieved 14 Aug. 2017The tune Inisheer, thesession.org, retrieved 14.

Sandoval has toured and collaborated with other artists, including Massive Attack, for whom she sang \\"Paradise Circus\\" on the 2010 album Heligoland, and the 2016 \\"The Spoils\\" single. Early life Sandoval was born June 24, 1966 in Los Angeles, California to Mexican-American parents, and raised in east Los Angeles. Her father was a butcher, while her mother worked for a potato chip manufacturing company. She has one sibling and seven half-siblings. Sandoval's parents separated when she was a child, and she was raised primarily by her mother. She attended Mark Keppel High School in Alhambra, but struggled socially and academically, and was placed in special education classes. She began to forgo her classes, instead staying home and listening to records. \\"It's just like anybody else‚Äîsome people, most people don't wanna go to school. They just don't want to,\\" Sandoval recalled. \\"I was just somebody who got away with it... There wasn't really anyone watching.\\" She eventually dropped out of high school. Sandoval took an interest in music at an early age, and, at age 13, was particularly influenced by the Rolling Stones. In 1986, she formed the folk music duo Going Home with Sylvia Gomez and sent a demo tape to David Roback. He contacted the duo and suggested that he would \\"play guitar for you guys\\". The material recorded by Gomez, Sandoval and Roback has yet to be released. Career =Opal and Mazzy Star (1988‚Äì1996)= Sandoval performed with the band Opal in the late 1980s alongside David Roback and long-time Roback collaborator Kendra Smith. After Smith's abrupt departure during a tour of the UK (hurling her guitar to the floor at the Hammersmith gig), Sandoval took over lead vocals. At the end of the tour, Roback and Sandoval began writing together and formed the alternative rock band Mazzy Star. The first Mazzy Star album, She Hangs Brightly, was released in 1990. While not a commercial success, this album did establish Mazzy Star as a band with a unique sound. The band had a surprise breakthrough hit single released in October 1993. \\"Fade into You\\" ‚Äì from its second album So Tonight That I Might See ‚Äì was recorded one year before it became a success. There is a continuity between the sounds and moods established on Mazzy Star's first two albums and its third, Among My Swan. Mazzy Star went on hiatus in 1997. =Hope Sandoval and the Warm Inventions (2000‚Äì2010)= Sandoval formed The Warm Inventions in 2000 and released her first solo album Bavarian Fruit Bread in 2001,\\"CD REVIEWS: Baby Blue Soundcrew, Lenny Kravitz, Matthew Good Band and many more\\". Chart Attack. October 30, 2001. Debbie Bento. which she recorded with My Bloody Valentine drummer Colm √ì C√≠os√≥ig. The album differed in terms of theme, voice, and instrumentation from that of her work with Mazzy Star. Bert Jansch plays guitar on two tracks, and the album features two covers, \\"Butterfly Mornings\\" from the film The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970) and Jesus and Mary Chain's \\"Drop\\". The Warm Inventions released two EPs, At the Doorway Again in 2000 and Suzanne in 2002 but did not win commercial success, with one video on MTV and little radio play. Sandoval recorded a song, \\"Wild Roses\\", for a compilation CD released by Air France, In the Air (2008). Hope Sandoval and The Warm Inventions released their second album, Through the Devil Softly, on September 29, 2009. Sandoval and her band were chosen by Matt Groening to perform at the edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival he curated in May 2010 in Minehead, England. The group also played the ATP New York 2010 music festival in Monticello, New York in September 2010 at the request of film director Jim Jarmusch. =Mazzy Star reformation (2011‚Äì2014)= In 2009, Sandoval confirmed in an interview with Rolling Stone that Mazzy Star was still active: \\"It's true we're still together. We're almost finished [with the record]. But I have no idea what that means.\\" In October 2011, the group released the single \\"Common Burn\\"/\\"Lay Myself Down\\", their first material in 15 years. The group stated that they had plans to release the album in 2012. In July 2013, \\"California\\", the first single from the new album was released. The album, Seasons of Your Day, was released in September 2013. =Renewed solo activity (2016‚Äìpresent)= On March 9, 2016, it was confirmed that Hope Sandoval & The Warm Inventions would release a 7\\" vinyl single titled \\"Isn't It True\\" for Record Store Day 2016.

It was founded by Tom Pastorius in 1986, and is located at 800 Vinial Street in the Troy Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, on the site of the former Eberhardt and Ober Brewery (founded in 1848). History and restoration of Eberhardt and Ober Brewery building Originally a contract brewing operation, Penn Brewery brewed its original and flagship product at the facilities of the Pittsburgh Brewing Company and then the Jones Brewing Company until 1989. Known as Penn Pilsner, Pastorius brewed the full bodied German-syle beer in strict accordance to the German Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516. Penn Pilsner quickly gained in popularity among Pennsylvania beer drinkers, increasing the need for its own brewing facility. Pastorius also recognized the demand for authentic German cuisine in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, spawning the idea of a \\"tied house\\", or brewery and restaurant under one roof, similar to the many beer halls he experienced while living in Germany for twelve years. Prior to 1987, however, Pennsylvania law prohibited such a facility. Pastorius responded by successfully lobbying Pennsylvania legislators to change state law. In 1987 Pastorius, signed a lease to become the anchor tenant in the former Eberhardt & Ober Brewery that was being redeveloped by the Northside Civic Development Council. The brewery is located at 800 Vinial Street on the North Side of Pittsburgh. Three of the original E & O brewery buildings remain, the stock house (c. 1880-84), and office building standing on a side cut into the rock of Troy Hill. Pastorius hired German Brewmaster Alex Deml to oversee construction of the 30,000 barrel-a-year capacity brewing facility, which included custom built micro-brewery equipment imported from Germany. On September 12, 1989, the Allegheny Brewpub (later renamed Penn Brewery) opened its doors, with dignitaries including Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie Masloff and Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey tapping the first keg. The Pennsylvania Brewery occupied 16,000 sq. ft. On the first floor. The Northside Civic Development Council operated a business incubator In the other 36,000 sq. ft. of the property, offering low-rent and consultants for start-up companies. In 2003, Wexford, PA, based Birchmere Capital LP purchased a controlling stake in Penn Brewery. Founder Tom Pastorius died on September 6, 2012. Pastorius' ancestor, Franz Daniel Pastorius, founded Germantown, Pennsylvania in 1683. =Closure= On January 2, 2009, Birchmere ended beer production at the Vinial Street location and laid off 8 of the 10 brewery employees. All production was outsourced to the Lion Brewery in Wilkes-Barre, PA. The restaurant was scheduled to close February 28, 2009, but a last-minute agreement allowed it to remain at its current location for the next five years. On August 19, 2009, Birchmere announced the indefinite closing of the Penn Brewery Restaurant. =Re-opening= On November 23, 2009, Penn Brewery issued a press announcement indicating that a small group of local investors, had acquired Penn Brewery from Birchmere Capital, under undisclosed terms, and that the original owner would be returning to lead a restart of brewing at the Vinial Street location, as well as an eventual reopening of the restaurant. On December 8, 2009, brewing officially resumed at the E & O facility, with the first mashing occurring at 10:20 AM. December 30, 2009 at 4:00 PM marked the first beer tasting of the new era of Penn Brewery. On December 30, 2009 the Penn Brewery Restaurant opened for a \\"sneak peek\\" preview of the beers. Festivities were open to the public and the response was incredible. In February 2010 a new kegging line was installed, and on February 17, 2010, the first kegs of locally brewed Penn Brewery beer were released to wholesalers. In March 2010 the Penn Brewery Restaurant started weekly \\"growler hours\\" every Friday from 4pm to 6pm. The public was given the opportunity to purchase pint drafts and half gallon growlers for home while construction continues on the kitchen. Varieties available on tap will vary based on latest brewings from Penn Brewery, but in general will include Penn Pilsner, Kaiser Pils, Penn Dark, and new Allegheny Pale Ale. In 2012, Pittsburgh Magazine named it one of the favorite breweries in Pittsburgh.

The main course of urban water is Carah√° River. Lages hosts an annual festival called Festa do Pinh√£o, that is famous throughout the country. Economically, the city is known for its strong cattle breeding and wood processing factories. History In the beginning of the 17th century, the arrival of the first Europeans established the town. The growing of the Campos de Lajens was due to the opening of roads to reach the fields of the state Rio Grande do Sul. The people of S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais were attracted to this region due to the cattle-breeding business with the gauchos. Very primitive documents mention Lajens as a stop for horse riders that were traveling from Sorocaba or S√£o Paulo, transporting mules, horses and cattle. Correia Pinto, the founder, was a horse rider, and ran cattle groups from Lajens to S√£o Paulo. On November 22, 1766, Lajens was promoted to state from village. In 1820 it detached itself from S√£o Paulo to be part of the state of Santa Catarina. On May 25, 1860, it was elevated to city status. In 1960 the city's name was changed to Lages with a \\"g\\" wrongly inserted. During the Revolu√ß√£o Farroupilha, Lages belonged to the state of Rio Grande do Sul.

The controversy concerned the relative merits of French and Italian opera. It was also known as the ' (\\"War of the Corners\\"), with those favoring French opera in the King's corner, and those favoring Italian opera in the Queen's corner. It was sparked by the reaction of literary Paris to a performance of Giovanni Battista Pergolesi's short intermezzo La serva padrona at the Acad√©mie royale de musique in Paris on 1 August 1752. La serva padrona was performed by an itinerant Italian troupe of comic actors, known as buffoni (bouffons in French, hence the name of the quarrel). In the controversy that followed, critics such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Friedrich Melchior Grimm, along with other writers associated with the Encyclop√©die, praised Italian opera buffa. They attacked French lyric tragedy, a style originated by Jean-Baptiste Lully and promoted by such French composers as Jean-Philippe Rameau.  Beginning of the quarrel  In France in the middle of the eighteenth century, the genre of \\"comic ballet\\" (such as Rameau's Plat√©e) was starting to acquire comic elements, while the genre of op√©ra bouffon was starting to produce a type of original comedy that was closer to farce and commedia dell'arte. Comedy at the Royal Academy of Music (Acad√©mie royale de musique, the future Paris Opera) was usually limited to trag√©die lyrique or trag√©die en musique. For something light, audiences went to the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, which would alternate tragedies with comedies and the farces of Moli√®re. In Italy, this evolution proceeded more rapidly, until opera split into two distinct genres. One of the genres was \\"serious opera\\" (opera seria) with serious themes from librettos by Apostolo Zeno and Metastasio. The other was comic opera (opera buffa, from buffo \\"to laugh\\", \\"grotesque\\", \\"farce‚Äù) with comic interludes marked with lightness, innocence, simplicity, irrationality, and the triviality of daily life. It was against this background that the arrival, in 1752, of La serva padrona at the Royal Academy of Music triggered a culture war among Parisian intelligentsia. The quarrel broke out on August 1, 1752, when Eustacchio Bambini's Italian touring company arrived in Paris to give performances of intermezzi and opera buffa. They opened with a performance of Pergolesi's La serva padrona (The Servant Turned Mistress). This work had been given in Paris before (in 1746) without attracting any attention. But this time it was performed at the Royal Academy of Music and it created a scandal. People were shocked, and supporters of French trag√©die lyrique squared off against supporters of Italian op√©ra bouffon in a dispute carried out through the medium of pamphlets.  The pamphlet war  In 1753 Jean-Jacques Rousseau published a pamphlet (Letter on French Music), boosting La serva; and at the end of the year, he published it in an engraved edition to disseminate an uncorrupted text. Both versions would weigh heavily in the reception of the work. :But without insisting on the tragic duets, a kind of music that we do not know in Paris, I can give you a comic duet that is known to everyone there, and I mention it boldly as a model of singing, unity of melody, dialogue, and taste, which I believe will lack nothing, when it will be well executed to audiences who know how to listen: this is the first act of La serva padrona, Lo conosco a quegl'occhietti, etc. I confess that French musicians are in a state of feeling beauty, and I would willingly say of Pergolesi, as Cicero said of Homer, that he has already made a lot of artistic progress, so that one enjoys reading it. ‚Äì Extract of Letter on French Music, by Jean-Jacques Rousseau After praising Italian music, he harshly condemned the French. :I believe to have been made to see that there is neither measure nor melody in French music, because the language is not sensitive; that French singing is only continual barking, unbearable to all unprejudiced ears; that the harmony is brutal, without expression and feeling uniquely like schoolboys' padding; that French airs are not airs; that French recitals are not recitals. Hence I conclude that the French have no music and can have none; or that if ever they have, so much the worse for them. ‚Äì Jean- Jacques Rousseau, ≈íuvres compl√®tes, Volume 10, p. 318 French mathematician Louis Bertrand Castel responded this way. :A nation like the French, whose unity has been so perfect for at least 1,200 years, even under the unity of a great empire does not willingly suffer superiority too marked, too pronounced, of any nation who has everything, neither for this range nor for this number, neither this ancient time nor this homeland. It can be argued that the quarrel represented a defense of French cultural and behavioral norms against an invasion by foreign (Italian) norms. In the approximately forty pamphlets published during the quarrel, one repeatedly finds the Italian taste for passion and emotion being rejected. French cultural preferences disliked comic opera for the laughter that it provoked; laughter that signalled loss of self- control and rationality. Italian operatic language tended to favor music and singing, while the French preference was more for the spoken word. Outcome of the quarrel  French public taste gradually became more accepting of Italian comedy, and the controversy burned out after two years. As early as October 1752 Rousseau presented Le devin du village (The Village Soothsayer) at Fontainebleau, and in 1753 in Paris. It was similar to the light opera being performed by the bouffons, but no one at court was shocked, possibly because Madame de Pompadour herself played the role of Colin. In 1754 Jean- Philippe Rameau presented a new version of his opera Castor and Pollux, that was quite successful, with 40 performances in 1754 and 1755. Graham Sadler writes that \\"It was ... Castor et Pollux that was regarded as Rameau's crowning achievement, at least from the time of its first revival (1754) onwards.\\"New Grove French Baroque Masters p.259 The effect of the quarrel was to open French opera to outside influences that triggered a renewal in the form. In particular, the Com√©die-Italienne and Th√©√¢tre de la foire developed a new type of opera that combined Italian natural simplicity with the harmonic richness of French trag√©die en musique.

This FM signal is then modulated as if it were a normal AM carrier, thus producing two modes on the single signal. Clearly the advantage of this is that both DRM and analogue radios can receive a signal they can discriminate and demodulate, with little disadvantage to either mode.

They met following the first of his two non-consecutive terms as the Republic's president, and married when he was a representative in the Congress of the Republic of Texas. She was his third wife, remaining with him until his death. She came from a close-knit family in Alabama, many of whom also moved to Texas when she married the man who was an accomplished politician in both Tennessee and Texas, and who had won the Battle of San Jacinto during the Texas Revolution. The couple had eight children, and she gave birth to most of them while he was away attending to politics. Her mother Nancy Lea was a constant in their lives, helping with the children, managing the household help, and always providing either financial assistance or temporary housing. With the help of her extended family in Texas, Margaret convinced her husband to give up both alcohol and profane language. He believed his wife to be an exemplary woman of faith and, under her influence, converted to the Baptist denomination, after he had many years earlier been baptized a Catholic in Nacogdoches, Texas. Following the Annexation of Texas to the United States, Sam Houston shuttled back and forth to Washington, D.C. as the state's U.S. senator for 13 years, while Margaret remained in Texas raising their children. When he was elected the state's governor, Margaret became First Lady of the state of Texas and was pregnant with their last child. Her brief tenure came on the cusp of the Civil War, at a time when the state was torn apart over the debate of whether or not to secede from the United States, while her husband worked in vain to defeat the Texas Ordinance of Secession. There was an attempt on his life, and angry mobs gathered in the streets near the governor's mansion. With no government protection provided, she lived in fear for her family's safety. Her husband was removed from office by the Texas Secession Convention for refusing to swear loyalty to the Confederacy. Margaret became a wartime mother, whose eldest son joined the Confederate Army and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Shiloh. Her husband died before the end of the war. In her few remaining years, she became the keeper of the Sam Houston legacy and opened his records to a trusted biographer. When she died of yellow fever four and a half years later, Margaret could not be buried with her husband in a public cemetery in Huntsville for fear of contamination, and was instead interred next to her mother on private property. Early life Margaret Moffette Lea was born April 11, 1819, into a family of devout Baptists in Perry County, Alabama. Her father Temple Lea was a church deacon and the state treasurer of the Alabama Baptist Convention, and her mother Nancy Moffette Lea was the only woman delegate at the convention's formation. Margaret was the fifth of six children that included older siblings Martin, Varilla, Henry Clinton and Vernal, as well as younger sister Antoinette. The Lea cotton plantation had been acquired with money from a Moffette family inheritance, and was operated by Nancy.Seale (1992), p. 7. When her father died in 1834, she inherited four slaves, including Joshua and Eliza, her favorite. The older Lea children had married prior to Temple's death, but Vernal, Margaret and Antoinette accompanied the widowed Nancy when she moved into her son Henry's home at Marion.Seale (1992), pp. 4‚Äì5. He was an accomplished attorney who sat on the boards of educational institutions, and would be elected to the Alabama State Senate in 1836.Roberts (1993), p. 10; Margaret was enrolled at Professor McLean's School, and also attended Judson Female Institute. The latter was founded by Baptists to instruct genteel young women in what were considered acceptable goals of their time and place, \\"proficiency in needlework, dancing, drawing, and penmanship\\". Heavy emphasis was put on Baptist theology and missionary work. She wrote poetry and read romantic novels, while also becoming accomplished on guitar, harp and piano. Reverend Peter Crawford baptized her in the Siloam Baptist Church of Marion when she was 19, by which time the eligible young lady was considered \\"accomplished, well-connected and deeply religious\\".Haley (2004), p. 211; Roberts (1993), p. 8, Seale (1992), pp. 6‚Äì9, 14‚Äì15, 17, 40, 44, 52, 54, 57, 64, 67, 69. Marriage alt=Sam Houston Sam Houston was an attorney by profession and politically accomplished even before he moved to Texas. In Tennessee, he had been both a member of the United States House of Representatives and governor.Seale (1992), pp. 20‚Äì21. His military victory at the Battle of San Jacinto elevated him to hero status in Texas.Crane (1884), pp. 17‚Äì23. After completing his first term as President of the Republic of Texas in early December 1838, he continued to practice law from his office in Liberty. He arrived in Mobile, Alabama, in the early months of 1839 as a partner of the Sabine City Company, seeking investors to develop a community that is today known as Sabine Pass.Haley (2004), p. 210. Through Martin Lea, he made the acquaintance of Antoinette's husband William Bledsoe, a wealthy businessman who in turn suggested Nancy Lea as a possible investor. Invited to a garden party at Martin's home, it was there Houston first became acquainted with Margaret. The mutual attraction was instantaneous.Seale (1992), pp. 11‚Äì12; Roberts (1993), pp. 17‚Äì21. Nancy was favorably impressed with Houston's land sales pitch, but not so impressed with his interest in her daughter. She and others in the family were concerned about his reputation as a hard- drinking carouser with a proclivity for profanity, who was 26 years older than Margaret and twice married.Haley (2004), pp. 9‚Äì10, 74‚Äì76. Several weeks of love letters had been exchanged between Margaret and Houston by the time he proposed marriage that summer of 1839, presenting her with his image carved on a brooch. In an effort to assuage the family's opposition to the union, Houston spent several weeks in the Lea home in Alabama.Roberts (1993), pp. 17‚Äì18, 23. In September during his absence from Texas, his supporters in San Augustine County elected him to serve in the Republic of Texas House of Representatives.Roberts (1993), pp. 23‚Äì25, 38; When the couple's engagement was announced in newspapers, the Leas were not the only ones who were skeptical. Acquaintances in Texas were well versed with his personal history and aware that he had not divorced his first wife when he married again, only recently obtaining that divorce with hopes of marrying a Texas woman who, as it played out, rejected him for another suitor.Haley (2004), pp. 200‚Äì201, 220; Jackson (2005), p. 247. Political crony Barnard E. Bee Sr. tried to discourage him from making a third attempt at marriage, believing him to be \\"totally disqualified for domestic happiness\\".Haley (2004), pp. 209‚Äì210, 220. As the day of their May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with uncertainty and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man with whom she had fallen in love.Roberts (1993), p. 28. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residencies.Seale (1992), pp. 17, 31‚Äì32. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for the hustle and bustle and preferred the lesser- populated Galveston.Seale (1992), pp. 44‚Äì45. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.Roberts (1993), p. 38; Seale (1992), pp. 35‚Äì36. First Lady of the Republic The year before he met Margaret, Houston had purchased property at Cedar Point on Galveston Bay in Chambers County, which he named Raven Moor, and planned to expand with income from his law practice.Haley (2004), pp. 201, 211; Flanagan (1973), p. 49. The existing two-room log dogtrot house with its detached slave quarters overlooked Galveston Bay and became the newlyweds' first home, filled with both Margaret's personal furnishings from Alabama, as well as newer pieces.Roberts (1993), pp. 38‚Äì39, 56‚Äì57; She renamed it Ben Lomond as a tip of the hat to the romantic Walter Scott works she had read, and delegated management of the household to her mother Nancy.Seale (1992), pp. 39‚Äì40, 44. During his second term as representative from San Augustine, Houston was elected in 1841 to once again serve as the Republic's president.Haley (2004), p. 222. Margaret disliked campaign events and, giving up her privacy, so she frequently stayed home while her husband traveled about the Republic canvassing for votes.Roberts (1993), pp. 54, 74; Seale (1992), pp. 40‚Äì42, 45. Yet, when she rose to the occasion, such as the extended post-election tour of San Augustine County and victory celebrations in Washington County and Houston City, the public adored her, and she became an impressive political asset.Roberts (1993), pp. 63‚Äì64; Seale (1992), pp. 59‚Äì63. She rode in a local presidential parade, but stayed home rather than travel to the inauguration in Austin.Seale (1992), pp. 64‚Äì65. When the couple appeared at several events in Nacogdoches, his old friends took notice of his total avoidance of alcohol, and he continued to assure her that he was giving it up completely.Roberts (1993), pp. 39‚Äì40, 53‚Äì54. He also began to clean up his language to please his new wife, and would eventually claim to have eliminated his profanity altogether.Roberts (1993), p. 74. Approximately north of Ben Lomond, the Bledsoes operated a sugar cane plantation at Grand Cane in Liberty County. Financially supplemented by Nancy, the plantation became a family gathering place.Seale (1992), pp. 37‚Äì38, 41; About a year after Vernal and Mary Lea also moved there, Mary suffered a pregnancy miscarriage. Not long after that, the couple accepted trusteeship of a 7-year-old Galveston orphan named Virginia Thorne, who was then placed in the care of Nancy. It was a problematic relationship from the beginning, and would grow to have legal ramifications for Margaret.Houston, Roberts (1996c), p. 468; Seale (1992), p. 80. Events leading up to the 1842 Battle of Salado Creek caused Houston to believe that Mexico was planning a full-scale invasion to re-take Texas. In response, he moved the Republic's capital farther east to Washington-on-the-Brazos, and sent Margaret back to her relatives in Alabama. Upon her later return, they temporarily lived with the Lockhart family at Washington-on-the-Brazos until they were able to acquire a small home there.Seale (1992), pp. 70‚Äì72, 75. The couple's first child Sam Houston Jr. was born in the new house on May 25, 1843.Roberts (1993), p. 99; Seale (1992), pp. 83‚Äì86. Upon learning of her son Martin's death in a duel, Nancy moved in with the Houstons, helping Margaret with the new baby, and over Houston's objections, pitching in with some financial assistance for food and household necessities.Houston, Roberts (1996a), p. 286. Extended family life =Raven Hill and Woodland = When his presidential term ended on December 9, 1844, Houston turned his attention to the Raven Hill plantation he had acquired that year northwest of Grand Cane and east of Huntsville. Margaret's slave Joshua was put in charge of the carpentry to build her a new house.Roberts (1993), p. 111; Flanagan (1973), p. 79. Nancy, Margaret and sister Antoinette devoted their time to activities in Grand Cane's Concord Baptist Church, of which they were founding members.Seale (1992), pp. 93‚Äì94, 99‚Äì100; She continued to be a wife who was happiest when she and her husband stayed close to home. Although she accompanied him to President Andrew Jackson's Tennessee funeral in the summer of 1845, she did not attend fetes held in her husband's honor by his old friends and supporters.Seale (1992), pp. 101‚Äì104; Haley (2004), p. 264. During the latter part of the year, Antoinette's husband William died, followed a few months later by the death of Vernal's wife Mary. Prior to her death, she had elicited a promise from Margaret to assume the trusteeship of Virginia Thorne.Seale (1992), pp. 93, 105. Texas officially relinquished its sovereignty on February 19, 1846, to become the 28th state in the union, and Houston was elected by the Texas State Legislature to serve in the United States Senate.Article 1, Section III of the United States Constitution states \\"The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.\\" Election by popular vote of individuals in a given state did not come about until the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified on April 8, 1913. Margaret's pregnancy prevented her from accompanying him, so when time and duty permitted he traveled back and forth between Texas and a temporary hotel residence in the nation's capital.Seale (1992), p. 113. When Reverend George W. Samson first met Houston at the E-Street Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., the senator told him that his attendance had been influenced by \\"one of the best Christians on earth\\", his wife Margaret. For the duration of his senatorial service, Houston regularly attended the E-Street church, sharing his wife's letters with Samson and delving into theological discussions pertaining to Margaret's interpretation of scriptures.Crane (1884), pp. 240‚Äì244. Margaret's sister Antoinette eloped with wealthy Galveston businessman Charles Power in April and began a new life on his sugar plantation.Roberts (1993), p. 125. Houston was home during a Congressional recess when their second child Nancy (Nannie) Elizabeth Houston was born at Raven Hill on September 6.Haley (2004), p. 298; Seale (1992), p. 120. About this time, in a letter to Houston that gave insight into Nancy's forceful constant presence in their lives, Margaret conceded, \\"She is high spirited and a little overbearing, I admit ...\\" but advised her husband to just give in to the insignificant issues. Houston replied, \\"I love the old Lady as a Mother, and have resolved to defer to her age and her disposition. Her blood is much like my own.\\"Houston, Roberts (1996b), p. 82; Roberts (1993), pp. 112, 129‚Äì130. alt=Woodland home During the early part of 1847, Houston's letters to Margaret were filled with his weariness of being away from home, and his concern that he had no letters from her for weeks. He promised that at the end of the current legislative session, he would \\"... fly with all speed to meet and greet my Love and embrace our little ones.\\" When she finally answered, she initially only told him of a serious illness that Sam Jr. had since recovered from, even though he was aware of previous problems she had with a breast lump. She had been advised to see a specialist in Memphis, Tennessee, if there was a recurrence. When complications appeared, family friend Dr. Ashbel Smith recommended surgery in Texas; only then, did she inform her husband of the situation. Upon receipt of her letter, Houston immediately departed Washington, D.C.Roberts (1993), pp. 142‚Äì151. After his return home, Houston negotiated a labor-swap arrangement with Raven Hill's overseer Captain Frank Hatch. In lieu of a cash payment for his services, the bulk of Houston's slave labor force was engaged to work on Hatch's property at Bermuda Spring. The remaining slaves were retained as house labor for Margaret.Seale (1992), p. 121. Eventually, Houston became the owner of Bermuda Spring when he and Hatch swapped properties,Seale (1992), pp. 122‚Äì127. and he set about to build the Woodland home for his wife. The first child to be born in the house was Margaret (Maggie) Lea Houston, arriving on April 13, 1848, while Congress was in session and Houston was in Washington.Haley (2004), p. 300. The widowed Vernal remarried to Catherine Davis Goodall in 1849, but trusteeship of Virginia Thorne, by now a teenager, remained with Margaret.Seale (1992), p. 147. With most of his time spent in the nation's capital, Houston's perception of Thorne was primarily second-hand gleanings from Margaret's letters; yet, he disliked and distrusted the orphaned girl to the point where he feared for the health and safety of his children with her in the house.Houston, Roberts (1996c), pp. 125, 219. Exacerbating the situation was Margaret's disapproval of the relationship that the teenage girl developed with overseer Thomas Gott. Push literally came to shove during an incident in which Margaret disciplined her for what she believed was rough handling of one of the children. Thorne alleged that during the ensuing dispute over the situation, Margaret had used threats and physical violence against her. After Thorne eloped with Gott a month later, the couple filed assault and battery charges against Margaret. When a grand jury investigation resulted in a deadlock, the matter was referred to the local Baptist church that Margaret helped found, and she was acquitted of the charges. Houston came to believe that the filing of legal charges against his wife had been encouraged by his political enemies.Houston, Roberts (1996c), pp. 468‚Äì481; Seale (1992), pp. 140‚Äì141,147‚Äì149, 151‚Äì153. Daughter Mary William (Mary Willie) Houston was born on April 9, 1850, in the Woodland house, during another Congressional session when Houston was in Washington. Their fourth child Antoinette (Nettie) Power Houston arrived on January 20, 1852, while he was again away on a business trip.Haley (2004), pp. 307, 312. Many friends and acquaintances came to visit the Houstons at Woodland, including members of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe who had allied with Houston during the Texas Revolution; he in return had assisted them in their being granted a reservation in east Texas. Throughout the last years of his presidency, Houston had made numerous efforts for the Republic to find common ground with the various tribes, asserting their right to own land. Many tribes had come to respect him as their friend.Haley (2004), pp. 300‚Äì400; Crane (1884), (Part II Indian Talks) pp. 334‚Äì348; ; Seale (1992), pp. 144‚Äì146; =Sam Houston's profession of faith= Nancy moved southwest of Huntsville to Independence in 1852, and much of the remaining Lea family began to form its nucleus in the Washington County community. Antoinette and Charles Power were also living in Independence after their Galveston sugar plantation was decimated by a hurricane.Seale (1992), pp. 154, 160. Brothers Vernal and Henry both died that year.Roberts (1993), pp. 233, 235. The following year, Varilla's husband Robertus Royston also died and she joined the rest of the family in Independence.Houston, Roberts (1996d), p. 54. That August, the Houstons bought a house near the original Baylor University campus in Independence.Seale (1992), p. 161. While Houston was attending to business in Washington, their sixth child Andrew Jackson Houston was born on June 21, 1854.Seale (1992), p. 167; Haley (2004), p. 329. alt=The old Baptist church in Independence, Texas As required by Mexican federal law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas, Houston had been baptized into the Catholic faith in the Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches prior to Texas independence.Haley (2004), pp. 104‚Äì105; By 1854, when Houston told Reverend Samson he felt compelled to make a public profession of faith, perhaps on the floor of the United States Senate, Margaret and her family had spent 14 years influencing her husband's faith. Ultimately, he decided to make the profession among those who knew him best in Texas. Word quickly spread about Houston's upcoming public baptism, and spectators traveled from neighboring communities to witness the event.Seale (1992), pp. 167‚Äì171; Reverend Rufus Columbus Burleson, the president of Baylor University and local church pastor, performed the rite in Little Rocky Creek, southeast of town. Houston afterwards still felt unworthy of taking the Eucharist and becoming a member of Margaret's church. At her request, Reverend George Washington Baines of Brenham counseled with him to eliminate his self-doubts.Crane (1884), pp. 240‚Äì243. In gratitude and celebration, Nancy sold her silverware to purchase a bell for the Rocky Creek Baptist Church.Seale (1992), p. 173. First Lady of the state The state legislature decided during Houston's third senatorial term not to re-elect him, so he ran for the office of Governor of Texas, losing to Hardin Richard Runnels.Roberts (1993), pp. 261‚Äì264; He was still in Washington when William (Willie) Rogers Houston was born on May 25, 1858, their last child born in the Woodland home.Roberts (1993), pp. 271‚Äì272; Haley (2004), p. 355. In order to satisfy creditors of his gubernatorial campaign debts, Houston was forced to sell the house to his political supporter J. Carroll Smith.Seale (1992), p. 188; He subsequently defeated incumbent Runnels with a second bid for the office during a period when the populace was bitterly divided over the issue of secession from the United States, and was sworn in December 31, 1859.Baum (1998), \\"Late Antebellum Texas: The Political Resurrection of Sam Houston\\", pp. 7‚Äì41; Construction on the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin had been completed three years earlier and first occupied by Governor Elisha M. Pease, whose wife played hostess to anyone who stopped by for a visit. The Houston family and their retinue of slaves moved into the mansion during a political climate that grew increasingly hostile over the secession debate. The family furniture had been moved from Independence by Joshua,Roberts (1993), p. 280. since the state government had no budget for staffing, furnishing or maintaining the governor's residence. That financial burden fell on the shoulders of the incumbent, and the state partially defaulted on Houston's salary.Seale (1992), pp. 192‚Äì193, 213; Margaret feared for the family's safety, as her husband worked towards defeating passage of the state's Ordinance of Secession. There had been a botched assassination attempt on Houston, and she saw throngs of angry malcontents gathering in the city. Margaret closed the mansion doors to all but those with an invitation from the Houstons.Haley (2006), p. 292. The family and household slaves resided on the second floor of the mansion, while others lived in the stable. As with everywhere else had they lived, she cared nothing about public life, and instead worked with Eliza and the other servants to create a home that welcomed extended family members and personal friends of the Houstons. Houston would occasionally hire out some of his labor force.Seale (1992), pp. 193‚Äì195, 198. The first child born in the Texas governor's mansion was also the last of the Houston children; Temple Lea Houston was delivered on August 12, 1860.Seale (1992), p. 200. This last birth left the 41-year-old Margaret debilitated for almost two weeks, with a watchful Houston constantly by her side.Roberts (1993), p. 292; Seale (1992), p. 202. The Texas Secession Convention passed the Texas Ordinance of Secession on February 1, 1861, effectively becoming part of the Confederate States of America on March 1. Houston, like all other office holders in the state, was expected to take an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy. He refused and was removed from office by the Secession Convention on March 16, succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Edward Clark.Haley (2004), pp. 390‚Äì391; Final years Their home in Independence having been leased out to the Baptists, retreating there was not an option. Houston was in poor health, as well as spiritually and financially broken. After a brief sojourn in Nancy's home, and over her objections, the family returned to Ben Lomond in early April.Seale (1992), p. 235; Haley (2004), p. 397. Sometime during August 1861, Sam Houston, Jr., enlisted in the Confederate States Army 2nd Texas Infantry Regiment, Company C Bayland Guards, sending Margaret into melancholia.Houston, Roberts (1996d), p. 387; Seale (1992), pp. 213‚Äì215. She dreaded that her first-born child would never be home again. \\"My heart seems almost broken ... what shall I do? How shall I bear it? When I first heard the news, I thought I would lie down and die\\", she wrote to her mother.Houston, Roberts (1996d), pp. 394‚Äì395; Seale (1992), pp. 213‚Äì215. Houston tried to help out by assuming care of their other children in between his extended visits to Galveston.Seale (1992), pp. 218‚Äì221. Her fears seemed well-founded when her son was critically wounded and left for dead at the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh. A second bullet was stopped by his Bible, bearing an inside inscription from Margaret. He was found languishing in a field by a Union Army clergyman who picked up the Bible and also found a letter from Margaret in his pocket. Taken prisoner and sent to Camp Douglas in Illinois, he was later released in a prisoner exchange and received a medical discharge in October.Haley (2004), pp. 402‚Äì404; Roberts (1993), pp. 313‚Äì314, 318. alt=Steamboat House Lacking the financial means to buy back their Woodland home, they rented the Steamboat House in Huntsville. The 69-year-old Houston was in his final days and physically feeble, requiring the use of a cane to get around. Until daughter Maggie took over as his personal assistant, his wife shouldered the duties. Even so, during this period, he managed to get the Confederate War Department to discharge all draftees from the Alabama- Coushatta tribe, which had distanced itself completely from the conflict.Haley (2004), pp. 400‚Äì401. On July 26, 1863, with Margaret at his bedside reading the 23rd Psalm to him, Houston died.Haley (2004), p. 417; Seale (1992), p. 230. His will named her as his executrix, and named his cousin Thomas Caruthers, as well as family friends Thomas Gibbs, J. Carroll Smith and Anthony Martin Branch, as executors. He had died land rich, but cash poor. The inventory compiled of his estate after his death listed several thousand acres in real estate, $250 cash, slaves (one of whom was Joshua Houston), a handful of livestock and his personal possessions.Margaret and the other executors of his estate specifically named each of the 12 slaves on the inventory, with a total valuation of $10,530. Haley (2004), p. 417. An enduring myth associated with Houston is that in 1862 he read his slaves the Emancipation Proclamation from a newspaper, and set them free. The proclamation took effect January 1, 1863. Slaves in Texas were not emancipated until June 19, 1865 by the issuance in Galveston of General Order No. 3 from Union General Gordon Granger, almost two years after Houston's death. The Texas constitution in effect under the Confederacy, Section III, Article 2, prohibited manumission (a slave owner freeing his slaves). Roberts (1993), p. 319; ; ;; ; Margaret was now a widow with seven of her eight children under the age of 18 and financially dependent on her. She returned to live near her mother in Independence, Texas,Seale (1992), p. 234. swapping land for a nearby property that became known as the Mrs. Sam Houston House. The Texas legislature eventually gave Margaret an amount equivalent to her husband's unpaid gubernatorial salary; nevertheless, in order to afford Sam Jr.'s enrollment at medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, she rented out the Ben Lomond plantation.Seale (1992), p. 252. Nancy Lea died of an undiagnosed set of flu-like ailments on February 7, 1864, and was entombed on the grounds of her home.Seale (1992), p. 239; Roberts (1993), p. 338. Margaret died on December 3, 1867, having contracted yellow fever during an epidemic. Walter Reed would not make his discovery of the cause of yellow fever through mosquito bite until 1900;Newton-Matza (2014), pp. 99‚Äì100. contamination through contact was the pervading fear in 1867, and prevented Margaret's remains from being interred in a public cemetery with her husband's. She was buried in the ground beside Nancy's tomb at 11 p.m. by her servant Bingley, family friend Major Eber Cave, and her two daughters Nettie and Mary Willie. No funeral service was performed.Seale (1992), pp. 256‚Äì258; Roberts (1993), p. 350. Legacy Two years after Sam Houston's death, Baylor University president William Carey Crane was commissioned by Margaret to write her husband's biography, allowing complete access to all correspondence and records. Crane was a Lea family friend from Alabama who had little more than a passing acquaintance with \\"the hero of San Jacinto\\". His perception of Margaret, however, was that of an extraordinary woman, in many aspects equal to the man she married. He stated that Houston's \\"guardian angel\\", as he called her, had set out from the time she met Houston to refine his rough edges and provide a solid foundation for his personal life.Crane (1884), pp. 9, 253‚Äì255. That assessment of Margaret's relationship with her husband was echoed over a century later by author James L. Haley, \\"... Houston trusted the care of his soul to Margaret, that he had no more war to fight within himself, left him with more energy to wage political battle.\\"Haley (2004), pp. 220‚Äì221. Ultimately, several of Houston's associates were cooperative with the Crane endeavor, but not everyone was inspired to join the effort. According to daughter Maggie, the author had told her that many valuable documents were destroyed by Margaret in a fit of anger when someone she considered a friend expressed disinterest. Life and Select Literary Remains of Sam Houston of Texas was rejected by the initial publisher, but was eventually published by J. B. Lippincott in 1884.Roberts (1993), pp. 344‚Äì345; Seale (1992), pp. 245, 247; After emancipation and Margaret's death, \\"Aunt Eliza\\", as the children called her, alternated her time between Nannie's and Maggie's households. When Eliza died in 1898, at her request, she was buried next to Margaret.Roberts (1993), p. 358. Nancy's tomb fell to decay over the years, after which she was re-interred in the ground with Margaret and Eliza. There was much discussion during the Texas 1936 centennial about moving Margaret's remains next to her husband's in Huntsville, but the family and various authorities never came to an agreement over it. Not until May 15, 1965, was an historical marker erected in Independence to denote her contributions to Texas history.Roberts (1993), p. 360. =Children= \\"First Lady and the matriarch of one of the most significant families in Texas history.\\" ‚Äì Texas Historical Commission *Sam Houston, Jr. (1843‚Äì1894) became a physician and author.

The story focuses on Margaret's role as a confidant of her husband from his days as president of the Republic of Texas to his time as governor, a post that he resigned in 1861 because he could not in good conscience support the Confederate States of America, of which Texas was a partner.

A cleaning station is a location where aquatic life congregate to be cleaned by smaller creatures. Such stations exist in both freshwater and marine environments, and are used by animals including fish, sea turtles and hippos. The cleaning process includes the removal of parasites from the animal's body (both externally and internally), and is performed by various smaller animals including cleaner shrimp and numerous species of cleaner fish, especially wrasses and gobies (Elacatinus spp.). When the animal approaches a cleaning station, it will open its mouth wide or position its body in such a way as to signal that it needs to be cleaned. The cleaner fish will then remove and eat the parasites from the skin, even swimming into the mouth and gills of any fish being cleaned. This is a form of cleaning symbiosis. Cleaning stations may be associated with coral reefs, located either on top of a coral head or in a slot between two outcroppings. Other cleaning stations may be located under large clumps of floating seaweed or at an accepted point in a river or lagoon. Some species of combtooth blenny, most notably the false cleanerfish, mimic the appearance and behaviour of cleaners, then tear away scales or flesh when suitably close to the victim.

Newport was a stalwart of Worcestershire County Cricket Club for most of the 1980s and 1990s, and played a key part in the county's triumphs in the late 1980s. Newport played in three Tests for England between 1988 and 1991. Life and career After playing a number of times for Worcestershire's Second XI in 1982, Newport made his first-class debut against the touring Pakistanis at New Road in July of that year. However, he had an unpromising beginning to his career at this level, failing to take a wicket and seeing his eleven overs costing 64 runs as the tourists scored 467 for 4 declared on their way to an innings victory. He returned to the Second XI for a while, but was then called up for the local derby with Warwickshire at Edgbaston. In this game he took the wicket of Dennis Amiss; picking up another in the second innings. Slowly Newport forced himself into contention for a regular spot in the county side, and in 1986 he made the breakthrough, winning his county cap and taking five wickets in an innings on five occasions, on his way to a total haul of 85 victims. He also scored his maiden first-class fifty in this season, the first of 22 he was to make in his career. Although he never managed to convert one of these into a century, his top score being 98 against the New Zealanders at Worcester in 1990. Newport had a mediocre 1987 season in England, his first- class batting average of over 41 that year being artificially inflated by twelve not-outs in twenty five innings. He had a happier time in one-day cricket, taking 34 wickets at 16.70, including his career-best one-day analysis of 5‚Äì22. That winter he went to play for Boland in South African domestic cricket, and was reasonably successful, averaging 25 with the bat and 19 with the ball. This set him up for the 1988 English season, and he put in some eye-catching performances. These included ten wickets in the match against Somerset, which helped Worcestershire to an innings victory; a further nine against Lancashire in early June; and in the next match, his career-best bowling figures of 8‚Äì52 in a rain-affected match against Middlesex. He also took nine wickets against a powerful Essex team containing Graham Gooch and Allan Border, picking up Border's wicket in both innings. This fine run of form brought Newport a place in the England team for the final Test match of the summer, against Sri Lanka in August. He acquitted himself well, taking 7‚Äì164 in the match, to help propel England to a comfortable seven-wicket victory, but was not selected for the (later cancelled) winter tour of India. He could console himself, however, with 93 first-class wickets, the best haul of his career, and ‚Äì more significantly ‚Äì Worcestershire's first County Championship title since 1974. 1989 started promisingly for Newport, with eleven wickets in Worcestershire's low-scoring win over the Australians, and he was named in the team for the First Test. His second taste of cricket at this level, however, was a chastening experience, as Steve Waugh ‚Äì on his first tour of England and on his way to 177 not out ‚Äì took a liking to Newport's seamers, and the Worcestershire bowler ended the first innings with figures of 2‚Äì153. He had no chance to make amends, being allowed only five overs in Australia's second innings, and was dropped for the Second Test of England's painful Ashes summer. Again, the domestic game was his salvation as Worcestershire retained their Championship. Newport's England career ran to only one more match. He was called up for the 1990/91 Perth Test while with the A team in Sri Lanka as a replacement for the injured Angus Fraser. He made 40 not out in a lost cause, coming to the crease with England 118 for 6, but did not impress with the ball, taking only one wicket and bowling six no-balls in his fourteen overs. He never played for England again, after a career lasting just three Tests and without a One Day International to his name. He spent another winter in South Africa, this time with Northern Transvaal, in 1992/93, but apart from that the remainder of Newport's career was spent in familiar surroundings with Worcestershire. He reached 50 wickets in every season from 1991 to 1995, but after that he gradually faded from first-team contention, although he did manage one last hurrah in 1997, when he took 7‚Äì37 in a drawn game against Leicestershire. Newport retired after the 1999 season, bowing out rather quietly with a National League game in which he did not bat or take a wicket, with only a single catch. Now he is a Geography teacher and Head of Boys Cricket at Royal Grammar School Worcester.

His fame began with the 1837 Battle of Jamrud, while attempting to regain Afghanistan's second capital Peshawar from the Sikh Empire. Wazir Akbar Khan was militarily active in the First Anglo-Afghan War, which lasted from 1839 to 1842. He is prominent for his leadership of the national party in Kabul from 1841 to 1842, and his massacre of Elphinstone's army at the Gandamak pass before the only survivor, the assistant surgeon William Brydon, reached the besieged garrison at Jalalabad on 13 January 1842. Wazir Akbar Khan became the emir of Afghanistan in May 1842, and ruled until his death in 1845. Early life Akbar was born as Mohammad Akbar Khan in 1816 to Emir Dost Mohammad Barakzai of Afghanistan and Merm…ôn Khadija Popalzai. Dost Mohammad Barakzai had 2 wives, 8 sons (including Wazir Akbar Khan) and 2 daughters. Adult life In 1836 Dost Mohammad Barakzai's Muslim forces, under the command of his son Wazir Akbar Khan, fought the Sikhs at the Battle of Jamrud, fifteen kilometers west of present-day Peshawar. Dost Mohammad Barakzai did not follow up this triumph by retaking Peshawar, however, but instead contacted Lord Auckland, the new British governor general in India, for help in fighting the Sikhs. With this letter, Dost Mohammad formally set the stage for British intervention in Afghanistan. At the heart of the Great Game lay the willingness of Britain and Russia to subdue, subvert, or subjugate the small independent states that lay between them. Akbar Khan led a revolt in Kabul against the British Indian mission of William McNaughten, Alexander Burnes and their garrison of 4,500 men. In November 1841, he besieged Major-General William Elphinstone's force in Kabul. Elphinstone accepted a safe-conduct for his British force and about 12,000 Indian camp followers to Peshawar; they were ambushed and annihilated in January 1842. At least one set of British war memoirs bore witness to Akbar Khan‚Äôs double dealing, saying that, during the retreat, Akbar Khan could be heard alternately commanding his men, in Persian to desist from, and in Pashto to continue, firing. In May 1842, Akbar Khan captured Bala Hissar in Kabul and became the new emir of Afghanistan. He ruled until his death in 1845. Some believe that Akbar Khan was poisoned by his father, Dost Mohammed Barakzai, who feared his ambitions. In fiction The historical figure Akbar Khan plays a major role in George MacDonald Fraser's novel Flashman.

It is east of, and contiguous with, Lundin Links. Largo is an ancient fishing village in the parish of Largo. An excavated late 5th century cemetery points to an early settlement of the site, and there are records of the Knights Templar holding lands to the east of the town in the 12th century. It was made a \\"burgh of barony\\" by Sir Andrew Wood in 1513. This meant it had the right to erect a mercat cross and hold weekly markets, but not the extensive trading rights of a royal burgh. In 1654, Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu mentions Largo as \\"Largow burne-mouth\\" in his Nova Fifae Descriptio. Lower Largo is famous as the 1676 birthplace of Alexander Selkirk, who provided inspiration for Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. The house that now stands at his birthplace on 99-105 Main Street features a life-sized statue of Selkirk wearing self-made goatskin clothes, scanning the horizon. A signpost at the harbour points to Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, some 7,500 miles distant, where Selkirk lived for more than four years as a castaway. The arrival of the railway in 1857 brought many tourists to Lower Largo's sandy beach. The village has retained many historic buildings from the 17th to 19th century, and in 1978 it was designated as a conservation area. The Fife Coast Railway line through Lower Largo was closed in 1965 as part of the restructuring programme of British railways known as the Beeching cuts (overseen by Richard Beeching), and though it has been disused since then the viaduct that dominates the village remains an important local landmark.

She was killed when she fell under the wheels of an experimental steam car built by her cousins. As the event occurred in 1869, she is the first person known to have been killed by a motor vehicle.Although some sources assert Mary Rose to be the first person killed by a motor vehicle, a steam carriage fatal accident in July 1834 preceded Rose's demise. In the 1834 event, a steam carriage constructed by John Scott Russell and operating a public transport service between Glasgow and Paisley overturned, causing a boiler explosion which killed four or five passengers and injured others. Russell's carriage comprised a steam engine pulling a combined passenger and fuel tender; Mary Rose's accident may be characteriesd as the first fatality involving a vehicle in the form of a contemporary motorcar, in which the engine is mounted and passengers ride on the same frame. Early life She was born Mary King in present-day Ferbane, County Offaly, on 27 April 1827, the youngest child of Henry and Harriett King. She and her sisters were educated at home, as were most girls at the time. However, her education was slightly different from the norm because she was of a renowned scientific family. She was interested in nature from an early age, and by the time she was three years old she was collecting insects. Interests Ward was a keen amateur astronomer, sharing this interest with her cousin William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse. Parsons built the Leviathan of Parsonstown, a reflecting telescope with a six-foot mirror which remained the world's largest until 1917. Ward was a frequent visitor to Birr Castle, producing sketches of each stage of the process. Along with photographs made by Parson's wife Mary Rosse, Ward's sketches were used to aid in the restoration of the telescope. Ward also drew insects, and the astronomer James South observed her doing so one day. She was using a magnifying glass to see the tiny details, and her drawing so impressed him that he immediately persuaded her father to buy her a microscope. This was the beginning of a lifelong passion. She began to read everything she could find about microscopy, and taught herself until she had an expert knowledge. She made her own slides from slivers of ivory, as glass was difficult to obtain, and prepared her own specimens. The physicist David Brewster asked her to make his microscope specimens, and used her drawings in many of his books and articles.  Distinctions  Universities and most societies would not accept women, but Ward obtained information any way she could. She wrote frequently to scientists, asking them about papers they had published. During 1848, Parsons was made president of the Royal Society, and visits to his London home meant that she met many scientists. She was one of only three women on the mailing list for the Royal Astronomical Society (the others were Queen Victoria and Mary Somerville, a scientist for whom Somerville College at Oxford University was named).  Marriage  On 6 December 1854, she married Henry Ward of Castle Ward, County Down, who in 1881 succeeded to the title of Viscount Bangor. They had three sons and five daughters, including Maxwell Ward, 6th Viscount Bangor. Her best-known descendants are her grandson Edward Ward, the foreign correspondent and seventh viscount, and his daughter, the Doctor Who actress Lalla Ward. Publications When Ward wrote her first book, Sketches with the microscope, she apparently believed that no one would print it because of her gender or lack of academic credentials. She published 250 copies of it privately, and several hundred handbills were distributed to advertise it. The printing sold during the next few weeks, and this was enough to make a London publisher take the risk and contract for future publication. The book was reprinted eight times between 1858 and 1880 as A World of Wonders Revealed by the Microscope. A new full-colour facsimile edition at ‚Ç¨20 was published in September 2019 by the Offaly Historical and Archaeological Society, with accompanying essays. (). Her books are: A Windfall for the Microscope (1856), A World of Wonders, Revealed by the Microscope (1857), Entomology in Sport, and Entomology in Earnest (1857, with Lady Jane Mahon), Microscope Teachings (1864), Telescope Teachings (1859). She illustrated her books and articles herself, as well as many books and papers by other scientists. Death Ward was the first automobile fatality. William Parsons' sons had built a steam-powered car. It was thought at the time that steam transport would be developed greatly during the near future (this was true for trains, but did not in fact become true for cars until the development of internal combustion engines). Steam cars were heavy and they did too much damage to the already uneven roads. In 1865 the Red Flag Act imposed a speed limit of four miles per hour for the countryside and two miles per hour in towns. This effectively ended the popularity of motorcars, but some enthusiasts still had one, often homemade, like the Parsons' vehicle. On 31 August 1869, she and her husband, Henry, were travelling in it with the Parsons boys: the Hons. Richard Clare Parsons and the future steam turbine pioneer Charles Algernon Parsons, and their tutor, Richard Biggs. She was thrown from the car on a bend in the road at Parsonstown (present-day Birr, County Offaly). She fell under its wheel and died almost instantly. A doctor who lived near the scene arrived within moments, and found her cut, bruised, and bleeding from the ears. The fatal injury was a broken neck. Legacy Ward's microscope, accessories, slides and books are on display in her husband's home, Castle Ward, County Down. William Parsons' home at Birr Castle, County Offaly, is also open to the public. Her great-granddaughter is the English actress and author Lalla Ward.

Design and development Development of the system began in 1977 as a 50/50 cooperative program between Hunting Engineering (now known as INSYS) of the UK and the US Air Force. The USAF intended to use the weapon with its FB-111 strike aircraft; however, in 1982 rising costs led them to pull out of the programme, and the British completed development on their own for potential use with the Tornado, Jaguar and Harrier. The dispensers could be carried on wing pylons: short-finned containers for bomblets, or medium-length finned containers for mines. The F-111 was capable of carrying a pair of each type, but the Jaguar and Harrier would be able to carry only a single pair of either type. The Tornado could be fitted with a pair of much larger pods on the shoulder pylons, each containing both types of munition. Each JP233 as fitted to the Tornado was divided into a rear section with 30 SG-357 runway cratering submunitions, while the front section carried 215 HB-876 anti-personnel mines. Both types of submunitions were retarded by small parachutes. The SG-357, which weighed 26 kilogrammes (57 pounds), was a two-stage munition. The longer, smaller-diameter forward section consists of a cylindrical high- explosive charge with a hole down the centre. The shorter, larger-diameter rear section held a shaped charge. At the front of the munition was a telescopic stand-off fusing system that created the correct detonation distance for the shaped charge. On impact, the extended fuse initiated the shaped charge, creating a molten metal jet which travelled through the centre of the forward charge element and then penetrated the concrete runway surface to create an underground chamber. The momentum of the cylindrical charge was enough for it to follow down through the hole created by the shaped charge before exploding some distance under the runway surface. This second explosion was intended to produce a crater with significant \\"heave\\" at the edge, making repairs much more difficult and time-consuming., JP233 project specialist, Ordnance Board, Ministry of Defence, UK, 1989-1993. The HB-876 mines would lie scattered on the surface, making rapid repair of the runway very hazardous. The outside of the munition was surrounded by a \\"coronet\\" of spring steel strips that were held flat against the sides of the mine. After landing on the surface a small explosive device would fire and release the coronet springs such that the mine would become \\"erect\\" on the surface, with their self- forging fragment warhead pointing vertically upwards. The cylindrical case of the mine was made from dimpled steel and on detonation would spread small steel anti-personnel fragments, rather like a hand-grenade, in all radial directions. They would explode at preset intervals or if disturbed. Standing above the surface on the coronet of spring steel legs, they would tilt toward a bulldozer blade when pushed before detonating and firing the forged fragment toward the vehicle. Unlike most other submunition delivery systems that essentially function as free-falling bombs, the JP233 dispenser pods remained with their aircraft during operation and were jettisoned once empty. Deployment Deployment was rather frightening for the flight crew, since it required the aircraft to fly low, straight and level over an enemy airfield, and when over the runway the pods would dispense their payload. During the Gulf War it was widely reported in the popular press that Tornados were shot down by AAA fire and MANPADS during delivery of the JP233 munition, but in fact none of the losses occurred during the attack phase of a JP233 mission. Only one aircraft was lost carrying the JP233 munition when Tornado ZA392 crashed into the ground approximately after delivering the weapon at low level; enemy fire was not reported and it was believed that this was an incident of controlled flight into terrain. What alarmed the crews of British and Saudi Arabian Tornados using JP233 was that the aircraft was brightly illuminated at night by the exploding munitions. Attacks using JP233 were suspended six days into the Gulf War, as the Iraqi Air Force was effectively flying no missions. With the increasing availability of standoff attack munitions capable of the same mission with little risk to the flight crew and aircraft, and the British entry into the Land Mines Treaty (which declares the HB-876 illegal), the JP233 has been withdrawn from service. Examples of the JP233 are in various museums. The Imperial War Museum also has films, viewable on the WorldWide Web, of tests of the JP233 Airfield Attack System and Airfield Denial System. The Cold War Gallery of the National Museum of the US Air Force has a JP233 on display, fitted to a Panavia Tornado GR1 aircraft.

Minimal techno is thought to have been originally developed in the early 1990s by Detroit-based producers Robert Hood and Daniel Bell.Mike Banks interview, The Wire, Issue #285 (November '07)Sicko, D., Techno Rebels: The Renegades of Electronic Funk, Billboard Books, 1999, (pp. 199‚Äì200). By the early 2000s the term 'minimal' generally described a style of techno that was popularized in Germany by labels such as Kompakt, Perlon, and Richie Hawtin's M-nus, among others. Origins Robert Hood DJing in 2009 Minimal techno first emerged in the early 1990s. The development of the style is often attributed to a so-called \\"second wave\\" of American producers associated with Detroit techno. According to Derrick May, \\"while the first- wave artists were enjoying their early global success, techno also inspired many up-and-coming DJs and bedroom producers in Detroit\\".May, B 2007, 'Techno', in Burnim, MV & Maultsby, PK (eds.), African American Music, New York: Routledge, (p. 340). This younger generation included producers such as Richie Hawtin, Daniel Bell, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Kenny Larkin, and Mike Banks. The work of several of these artists evolved to become focused on minimalism. Robert Hood describes the situation in the early 1990s as one where techno had become too \\"ravey\\", with increasing tempos leading to the emergence of gabber. Such trends saw the demise of the soul-infused techno that typified the original Detroit sound. Robert Hood has noted that he and Daniel Bell both realized something was missing from techno in the post-rave era, and saw that an important feature of the original techno sound had been lost. Hood states that \\"it sounded great from a production standpoint, but there was a 'jack' element in the [old] structure. People would complain that there's no funk, no feeling in techno anymore, and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap. I thought it was time for a return to the original underground.\\" The minimal techno sound that emerged at this time has been defined by Robert Hood as \\"a basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what's essential. Only what is essential to make people move. I started to look at it as a science, the art of making people move their butts, speaking to their heart, mind and soul. It's a heart-felt rhythmic techno sound.\\"Robert Hood interview hosted at spannered.org Daniel Bell has commented that he had a dislike for minimalism in the artistic sense of the word, finding it too \\"arty\\". Richie Hawtin DJing at Fabric In Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music (2004), music journalist Philip Sherburne states that, like most contemporary electronic dance music, minimal techno has its roots in the landmark works of pioneers such as Kraftwerk and Detroit Techno's Derrick May and Juan Atkins. Minimal techno focuses on \\"rhythm and repetition instead of melody and linear progression\\", much like classical minimalist music and the polyrhythmic African musical tradition that helped to inspire it.Sherburne, P., \\"Digital Discipline: Minimalism in House and Techno,\\" inAudio Culture, New York: Continuum, 2006, (pp. 321‚Äì322). By 1994, according to Sherburne, the term \\"minimal\\" was in use to describe \\"any stripped-down, Acidic derivative of classic Detroit style\\".Sherburne, Philip. \\"Digital Discipline: Minimalism in House and Techno,\\" in Audio Culture, New York: Continuum, 2006,(p.321). Los Angeles-based writer Daniel Chamberlin attributes the origin of minimal techno to the German producers Basic Channel.Sicko, D., Techno Rebels: The Renegades of Electronic Funk, Billboard Books, 1999, (pp. 174‚Äì175) Chamberlin draws parallels between the compositional techniques used by producers such as Richie Hawtin, Wolfgang Voigt, and Surgeon and that of American minimalist composer Steve Reich, in particular the pattern-phasing system which Reich employs in many of his works, the earliest being \\"Come Out\\". Chamberlin also sees the use of sine tone drones by minimalist composer La Monte Young and the repetitive patterns of \\"In C\\" by minimalist composer Terry Riley as other influences.Chamberlin, Daniel. \\"Party Arty: Minimal techno producers live up to their avant-garde heritage and turn the party out, brainiac-style\\" The Miami New Times, September 18, 2003, Music section. Sherburne has suggested that the noted similarities between minimal forms of dance music and American minimalism could easily be accidental. He also notes that much of the music technology used in electronic dance music was traditionally designed to suit loop-based compositional methods, which may explain why certain stylistic features of minimal techno sound similar to those in works by Reich that employ loops and pattern-phasing techniques.Sherburne, Philip. \\"Digital Discipline: Minimalism in House and Techno,\\" in Audio Culture, New York: Continuum, 2006, (p.322).  Style  Philip Sherburne proposes that minimal techno uses two specific stylistic approaches: skeletalism and massification.Cox C. & Warner D. ed.(2004), Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music, Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd, London. According to Sherburne, in skeletal minimal techno, only the core elements are included with embellishments used only for the sake of variation within the song. In contrast, massification is a style of minimalism in which many sounds are layered over time, but with little variation in sonic elements. Today the influence of minimal styles of house music and techno is not only to be found in club music, but is becoming increasingly heard in popular music.Sherburne, Philip. \\"Digital Discipline: Minimalism in House and Techno,\\" in Audio Culture, New York: Continuum, 2006, (pp. 324‚Äì325). Regardless of the style, he writes, \\"minimal Techno corkscrews into the very heart of repetition so cerebrally as to often inspire descriptions like 'spartan', 'clinical', 'mathematical', and 'scientific.'\\" The average tempo of a minimal techno track is between 125 and 130 beats per minute. Richie Hawtin suggests 128 bpm as the perfect tempo. In the early minimal techno scene, most tracks were constructed around a Roland TR-808 or Roland TR-909 drum machine. Both are still often used on today's minimal techno tracks. In contrast to minimal house, minimal techno is less afrocentric and focuses more on middle frequencies rather than deep basses. Development Many projects in other locations, such as those of Regis in the UK, Basic Channel in Berlin and Mika Vainio in Finland, have also made significant contributions to minimal techno. In recent years, the genre has been heavily influenced by the microhouse genre, to the point of merging with it. It has also fragmented into a great number of difficult to categorize subgenres, equally claimed by the minimal techno and microhouse tags. Minimal techno has found mainstream club popularity since 2004 in such places as Romania \\"The History of Ro-Minimal\\" , GermanyNye, Sean, \\"Minimal Understandings: The Berlin Decade, The Minimal Continuum, and Debates on the Legacy of German Techno,\\" Journal of Popular Music Studies 25, no. 2(2013): 154-84., Portugal, Japan, France, Belgium, South Africa, The Netherlands, Spain, Sri Lanka, Italy, Ireland and the UK, with DJs from a wide variety of genres incorporating differing elements of its tones.

Such a menu may be called prix fixe (\\"fixed price\\"). The terms set meal and set menu are also used. The cutlery on the table may also already be set for all of the courses. Table d'h√¥te contrasts with √† la carte, where customers may order any of the separately priced menu items available. Etymology Table d'h√¥te is a French loan phrase that literally means \\"the host's table\\". The term is used to denote a table set aside for residents of a , who presumably sit at the same table as their host. The meaning shifted to include any meal featuring a set menu at a fixed price. The use in English is documented as early as 1617, while the later extended use, now more common, dates from the early nineteenth century.\\"Table d'h√¥te, n.\\" OED Online, Oxford University Press, March 2019. Accessed 20 March 2019. No website link due to limited access that requires a subscription to OED Online. OED- stands for Oxford English Dictionary. In France, the term began in inns where guests ate at a common table, called the \\"Host's table\\" (though the host typically did not sit with the guests).Jim Chevallier, A History of the Food of Paris: From Roast Mammoth to Steak Frites, 2018, , p. 79, 92 By the end of the seventeenth century, similar meals were being hosted by other eateries (cabarets and traiteurs), and were initially known as \\"inn's tables\\" (tables d'auberge). This practice of serving a set meal at a collective table became the most common (though not the only, as is sometimes claimed) way of dining in public in Paris before the restaurant appeared. Places which offered tables d'h√¥te sometimes also allowed √† la carte ordering. In the nineteenth century, the term survived but often for service at individual tables.\\"Europe: Ancient, Medieval, and Early Modern\\" Spang, Rebecca L. \\"Restaurants.\\" Encyclopedia of Food and Culture, edited by Solomon H.

Some tables d'h√¥te were then elegant but unsavory places which attracted gamblers and others looking for unwary victims. Country- specific practices Many restaurants in the United States convert their menus to prix fixe only for special occasions. Generally, this practice is limited to holidays where entire families dine together, such as Easter and Thanksgiving, or on couple-centric holidays like Valentine's Day. In France, table d'h√¥te refers to the shared dining (sometimes breakfast and lunch) offered in a vacation named chambre d'h√¥te (similar to \\"bed and breakfast\\"). Every guest of a chambre d'h√¥te can join this meal, cooked by the hosting family. It is not a restaurant, there is only one service, the price is fixed and usually included in the vacation. Everyone sits around a large table and makes small-talk about the house, the country, and so on. What is closer in French to the meaning of table d'h√¥te in English is a menu (\\"lunch special\\" or \\"fixed menu\\"). It usually includes several dishes to pick in a fixed list: an entr√©e (introductory course), a main course (a choice between up to four dishes), a cheese, a dessert, bread, and sometimes beverage (wine) and coffee all for a set price fixed for the year between ‚Ç¨15 to ‚Ç¨55. The menu du jour, a cheaper version with less choice, an entr√©e and a main course, the plat du jour (\\"dish of the day\\") changed every day, is usually between ‚Ç¨9 to ‚Ç¨15. In Belgium, restaurants in the medium to high price range tend to serve menus where the customer can compose a menu from a list of entrees, main courses and desserts. These dishes can be ordered separately and all have a different pricing depending on the ingredients used. However combined in a three-, five-, or seven-course menu they will be served at a fixed pricing that is usually ‚Ç¨10‚Äì15 cheaper than when ordered separately. Also in many cases if a menu is chosen it will be accompanied by amuses (little side dishes between the courses). Wine and other beverages are almost always excluded. Japanese salt grilled salmon (teishoku) In Sweden almost all restaurants‚Äîfrom the simplest diner to the finest luxury restaurant‚Äîserve Dagens r√§tt (\\"the daily dish\\") during lunch hours (on weekdays) at a much lower price than the same dish would cost at other times. Most commonly there is a choice of two or three dishes: a meat/fish/poultry dish, a vegetarian alternative, and a pasta. Salad buffet, bread and butter and beverage are included, and sometimes also a simple starter, like a soup. In India, the thali (meaning \\"plate\\") is very common in restaurants. The main course consisting of rice or roti (flat bread) and assorted side dishes and vegetables is arranged on a large plate. This may be followed by dessert. There may be more than one kind of thali‚Äîvegetarian, tandoori, deluxe‚Äîthe name signifying the prix-fixe items as well as the price. In Spain, there is the men√∫ or men√∫ del d√≠a, which usually includes a starter, a main dish, bread, drink and choice of coffee or dessert. It may range in price from ‚Ç¨8 to ‚Ç¨30, with ‚Ç¨10 being the average price. In Romania, the most typical fixed-price menu is called daily menu ('), taken in the daytime, on weekdays only. In Russia, the most typical fixed-price menu is called business lunch (–±–∏–∑–Ω–µ—Å-–ª–∞–Ω—á) or fixed lunch (–∫–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å–Ω—ã–π –æ–±–µ–¥), taken in the daytime, on weekdays only.

Osterie vary widely in what they offer, but most serve simple foods and wine sourced locally, and prepared according to the local practices.

It is about 55 km northwest of Dublin. R√°th Chairn Gaeltacht was founded in 1935 when 41 families from Conamara were settled on land previously acquired by the Irish Land Commission. Each family was provided with a Land Commission house and a farm of approximately 8.9 hectares (22 acre), a sow, piglets and basic implements. A further 11 families joined the original settlers in 1935. In all, 443 people moved from Connemara to the R√°th Chairn area. In 1967 R√°th Chairn received official recognition as a Gaeltacht, following a local campaign.RathCairn.com - History Today, it and the nearby village of Baile Ghib make up the Meath Gaeltacht. A cooperative (the \\"R√°th Chairn Cooperation Society\\") was formed in 1973.

The colonists were poor farmers largely from Connemara and Kerry, who were planted by the government in order to save the Irish language and traditions. = The Resettlement = In 1935, the first batch of families from the Connemara Gaeltacht moved east to R√°th Chairn to live on land acquired by the Land Commission. The initiative promised potential migrants a higher quality of life, greater crop yields than Connemara and newly built homes. The proposal also aimed to stop the decline of the Irish language by creating an Irish- speaking community in a new location. For the most part, when the migrants arrived, they were welcomed into a county where the ethos of the romantic Gaelic revival was in full swing. However, resentment manifested itself in local newspapers, that the migrants were given the land in preference to the local farmers.

Biography Nahum Sokolow, 1910 Nahum Sokolow was born in Wyszogr√≥d, near P≈Çock, Poland (then Russian Empire). He began to attend heder at the age of three. When he was five, his parents moved to P≈Çock. At the age of ten, he was already renowned as a Hebrew scholar. His father wanted him to study for the rabbinate but with the intervention of Baron Wrangel, the governor of P≈Çock, he enrolled in a secular school. He married at eighteen and settled in Makov, where his father-in-law lived, and earned a living as a wool merchant. At the age of 20, he moved to Warsaw and became a regular contributor to the Hebrew daily HaTzefirah. Eventually he wrote his own column and went on to become editor and co-owner. In 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, he moved to London to work with Chaim Weizmann. Sokolow with wife 1935 Sokolow died in London in 1936. Literary career Sokolow was a prolific author and translator. His works include a three-volume history of Baruch Spinoza and his times, and various other biographies. He was the first to translate Theodor Herzl's novel Altneuland into Hebrew, giving it the name Tel Aviv (literally, \\"An Ancient Hill of Spring\\"). In 1909, the name was adopted for the first modern Hebrew- speaking city. Zionist activism In 1906, Sokolow was asked to become the secretary general of the World Zionist Congress. In the ensuing years, he crisscrossed Europe and North America to promote the Zionist cause. After moving to London, he was a leading advocate for the Balfour Declaration of 1917 in which the British government declared its support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. On 6 February 1917, a meeting was held in Maida Vale with Weizmann to discuss the results of the Picot convention in Paris. Sokolow and Weizmann pressed on after they had seized leadership from Gaster; they were granted official recognition from the British government.Schneer, p.202 Historian Martin Kramer argues that securing the assent of Britain's French and American Allies and of the Vatican, which controlled many Christian Holy Sites in the Land of Israel, was a necessary precondition for the Balfour Declaration. Sokolow secured the support of Pope Benedict XV on 4 May 1917, who described the return of the Jews to Palestine as \\"providential; God has willed it\\". Sokolow secured the assent of the France in the Cambon letter of 4 June 1917, signed by Jules Cambon, the head of the political section of the French foreign ministry. Chaim Weizmann wrote to the Manchester Zionist, Harry Sacher, who became a focus for the view that Sokolow and Weizmann had capitulated and forfeited the right to lead by \\"preferring British Imperialism... to Zionism\\".Stein, 'Letters', letter no.313, 7335, WI ‚Äì filed miscellaneous; Schneer, p.207 Sokolow acted as Weizmann's eyes and ears in Paris on a diplomatic mission with Sir Mark Sykes to negotiate with the French. The idea that the Jews would form a new kind of Triple Entente under the Ottoman Empire was unsettling to them. No, the delegation left for Paris on 31 March 1917. One purpose of the Entente was to strengthen the hand of Zionism in the US. \\"The Jews represented a powerful political and economic force... if subterranean influence\\".Sykes to Picot, 28 February 1917, Oxford, St Anthony's, MEC, SP, GB 165-0275/32B; Schneer, p.211 Sokolow did not know of the Sykes-Picot Agreement and British-French understanding on Middle Eastern policy matters. He believed that he must report to Weizmann that what France really meant by a \\"Greater Syria\\", taking the whole of Palestine for themselves. In a series of letters in April and May 1917, Weizmann accused Sokolow of letting the Zionists down in negotiations with France. Sokolow countered by replying that he remained totally committed to a British Palestine. Yitzhak Ben-Zvi addresses Zionist General Council meeting in Jerusalem, 1935. From right to left: I. Rupaisen, Ben-Zion Mossinson, H. Farbstein, Nahum Sokolow, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Yosef Sprinzak, I. L. Goldberg, Shmaryahu Levin, Eliezer Kaplan. The desiderata or things desired by the Jews for their new homeland were \\"facilities of colonization, communal autonomy, rights of language and establishment of a Jewish chartered company.\\"Sokolow to Weizmann, 4 April 1917, CZA, Sokolow Papers Sokolow's eventual diplomacy triumph for Zionism in Paris made them \\"accept in principle the recognition of Jewish nationality in the capacity of National Home, local autonomy etc. It is beyond my boldest expectations\\", he wrote. They expected a quid pro quo for support against Germany, which was further made urgent by the entry of the US on 6 April 1917 to the global conflict. They now associated an Allied victory with securing \\"Zionist aspirations\\", a phrase also used by Sykes in his despatches to Balfour.NA, FO371/3045; Schneer, 395 On 9 April, the Paris conference ended, marking a high point in Sokolow's career. The Zionists were now open to all diplomatic rounds. Sokolov came to Rome to gain support for the plan of a Jewish state in Palestine and spoke to Monsignor Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII. That Pope Benedict XV had vehemently condemned anti-Semitism a year earlier was seen as a good omen. In Rome, the Vatican City were considering accepting terms. Sokolow's letters asked advice from Weizmann; the amazed Sokolow met the Pope on 6 May. The Zionists began to feel more confident about their patriotism. Sokolow asked for \\"moral support\\", a philosophical equality, and immediately wrote Weizmann about the \\"expressing of favour\\", but Weizmann was not so emotional since he had a tough hard-headed businesslike character. He congratulated Sokolow on the success. Sokolow was called upon to stop at Paris by Jules Cambon and Prime Minister Alexandre Ribot. They were still concerned that Zionism would cause unlimited damage to world security if unleashed in Bolshevik Russia. Sokolow with Menachem Ussishkin, Jerusalem 1930In 1931, Sokolow was elected President of the World Zionist Congress and served in that capacity until 1935, when he was succeeded by Chaim Weizmann. Sokolow also served as President of the Jewish Agency for Palestine (now called the Jewish Agency for Israel) between 1931 and 1933, when he was succeeded by Arthur Ruppin.

Introduced in 1997, the brand uses the \\"razor-and-blades\\" business model; whereby the consumer purchases the handle assembly at a low price, but must continue to purchase replacement refills and pads over the lifespan of the product. Swiffer has become a half-billion dollar brand in fifteen countries. Products =Current products= All the products below have a refill system. Both the product and the refills are currently marketed. * Swiffer Bissell Steamboost is a steam mop. It uses special steam pads and it deeply penetrates dirt. * Swiffer Continuous Clean Air Cleaner is an air filtration system introduced in 2018. Like Swiffer mops, it uses a refill system for the filter, which is a common model across the air filtration industry. This product line is manufactured and marketed by a P&G; licensee, Project Air LLC, of Cranberry, New Jersey. * Swiffer Dusters are disposable dusters. They are advertised as 360¬∞ (All-Around) but the traditional Swiffer Dusters are also available (one side only). The optional extensible handle is 3 feet long, fully extended. The Swiffer Duster was introduced in 2003. * Swiffer Dust-N- Shine is a furniture polish. The product utilizes a user-supplied dusting cloth as the pad. * Swiffer Sweeper is a combination sweeper-mop. That is, it can use either dry or wet-type disposable cloths. The wet cloths are for mopping and they have scrubbing strips which are for scrubbing tough dried-on greases. The dry type is for sweeping fine dirt, dust, hair, lint, and more. Originally, only the dry cloths were available, and was branded simply as \\"Swiffer\\" since it was the only product. Wet cloths for mopping were introduced in 2001. * Swiffer Sweep and Trap was introduced in 2013 and has blades that grab big particles (like cereal) while a dry cloth picks up smaller particles, such as dust or lint. * Swiffer Sweep + Vac is a lightweight vacuum cleaner. It utilizes a dry cloth for removing lint and fine dirt, while the vacuum picks up larger crumbs. As with all bagless vacuums, a removable filter needs to be cleaned after each use, and eventually replaced when too dirty to clean. The system cannot utilize wet cloths. It was introduced in 2004. At some point, the name was changed to Swiffer Sweeper-VAC and was discontinued in 2013. It was brought back in 2016. * Swiffer Sweeper X-Large has a cloth head that is 1¬Ω times larger than the regular Swiffer Sweeper. It utilizes two regular-sized wet cloths or one dry cloth designed for the system. This product was formerly called \\"Swiffer Max\\", \\"Swiffer Sweeper Heavy Duty\\" and \\"Swiffer Sweeper Professional\\". It was introduced in 2001. In 2013, it was once again renamed Swiffer Sweeper X-Large. * Swiffer WetJet is a mop. It only utilizes WetJet brand solvent in a special, unopenable bottle. It was introduced in 2001 in Canada and Belgium but came to the United States in 2002. Its original name was the Swiffer WetJet Power Mop. It was originally blue-green in color until its redesign in 2006 when it changed to a purple color. It was modified again in 2009 with double sprayers added. = Past products = The following products have been discontinued. * Swiffer Carpet Flick is a carpet-sweeping device that used a disposable, sticky card to collect dust, pet hair and fine dirt. Introduced January 1, 2005, it was discontinued December 31, 2008. The refills are also no longer listed on the P&G; website; retail supplies can still be found, but are now expensive. * Swiffer Mitts were dry cloths that could fit in your hand. Introduced in 2002, they were discontinued in 2004. Its inventor is Willow Jackson. It is the only Swiffer product that is not a system (permanent unit and refills), as effectively the user's hand serves as the permanent part of the \\"system.\\" It is no longer listed on P^G's website, but can still be found at retail. Reusable cloths Because of the requirement to dispose of the cloth after each clean, using the device frequently can be quite costly. Because of this multiple third-party companies have created cloth reusable pads typically made out of a microfiber fabric that can be machine washed after each use. Television commercials The TV commercials for Swiffer often have 1970s/1980s music playing in the background. The old commercials start with a person having their old cleaning products and proceed to switch to Swiffer Products. The first series of commercials begin with a woman using the Swiffer product, while her old cleaning product (usually a mop, broom or feather duster), having a persona, is left out and wants to be used again. The woman continues to use her Swiffer and the mop is left by itself. The second series of commercials include the mop, broom or feather duster finding moving on to a new girlfriend (including a bowling ball, a rake or an antique doll). A commercial announcer states, \\"Switch to Swiffer, and you'll dump your old (mop, broom, duster). But don't worry. He'll find someone else.\\" Notable songs used in these commercials include \\"Whip It\\" by Devo, \\"Don't You Want Me\\" by Human League, \\"One Way or Another\\" by Blondie, and \\"Baby Come Back\\" by Player. Recent commercials use \\"What About Love\\" by Heart, \\"Who's That Lady\\" by The Isley Brothers, \\"A Little More Time\\" by Chairmen of the Board, \\"Love Stinks\\" by The J. Geils Band, and \\"You Sexy Thing\\" by Hot Chocolate. Origin The electrostatic cleaning system which P&G; sells under the Swiffer brand was created by Kao Japan. An excerpt from a 1999 BizJournals article explains that \\"P&G; can't claim it came up with the [Swffer] idea on its own. A similar product was already on the market in Japan, by a company called Kao\\". \\"KAO was marketing this product in Japan for five years,\\" said Cynthia Georgeson, spokeswoman for S.C. Johnson, a $5 billion-a-year, family-run business with brands including Pledge, Johnson Wax, Raid and Windex. King said P&G; knew of the Kao product, but did not seek a licensing agreement.\\" There are a few sources that say P&G; copied the complete design from Kao after learning that the design was not patented. P&G; may have licensed the original design. It is said that when Swiffer launched in Japan, it was so similar to the original Kao product that the Swiffer and Kao parts were interchangeable.

It is tall and stretches from the northwest white road pass Vaganj (1173 m) to the Bu≈°ko Blato artificial lake. The tallest peak is Konj (Horse) , which i located in Bosnia and Herzegovina and offer views of both sides of the border. In clear weather, it is possible to see the most remote areas of the Adriatic Sea and its islands. The vicinity's many trails and caves make it popular with hikers.  Ecosystem  Kame≈°nica is a favorable habitat for many species of plants and animals. The ecosystem of the northern parts of the mountain has been completely preserved due to its isolated location and the thick forest that surrounds it. Climate Most of Kame≈°nica's peaks are covered by snow for six to seven months of the year. Most of Kame≈°nica has a climate characterized by its position in two main climate regions; continental (northern side which is surrounded by Livanjsko field, 700 m above sea-level with mean annual temperature of 9 ¬∞C) and submediterranean (southern side which is surrounded by Sinjsko field, 300 m above sea-level where the mean annual temperature is 12.5 ¬∞C). Only the highest parts of Kame≈°nica (above 1300 m), have a snowy-forested climate. The weather and the mean annual air temperature can be compared using data of Zavizan metro station (1594 m). The lowest temperature on Kame≈°nica during the winter approximately measures -20 ¬∞C. Mean annual quantity of precipitation on Kame≈°nica ranges from 1200 mm to 2500 mm (maximum quantity on the peaks Konj, Kurljaj, Burnjaca and Gareta). In general, the climate of Kame≈°nica is very similar to the climate of Velebit. The \\"Bura\\" is a dry and cold wind that blows from the northeast (from continent towards sea). While the bura is blowing, the peaks of Kame≈°nica are in the cloud called \\"Cap\\".

He most recently co-anchored the weekend evening newscasts on WRC-TV in Washington, D.C.. At various times, he has appeared on the newscasts at noon, 5, 6, and 11 pm at WCBS-TV. His last day with the station was May 22, 2008 after the 6pm newscast. Career Rosenfield started his television news career in 1981, after graduating from Duke University. He started out at WTVD-TV in Durham, North Carolina, where he was a general assignment reporter. He moved to Houston, KTRK-TV, as a reporter and eventually anchor. He later moved to Chicago, where he became a reporter and weekend anchor at WLS-TV. He came to New York in 1998, and joined WCBS-TV, where he co-anchored the noon newscast with Cindy Hsu, and the 5pm newscast with Lisa Cooley (later known as Lisa Hill). He left WCBS in April 2000 after a contract dispute and joined rival station WNBC-TV, where he co-anchored the 5pm newscast (\\"Live at Five\\") with Sue Simmons. He left WNBC in 2005, and returned to WCBS in June of that year to replace Ernie Anastos, who in turn left WCBS for a 5-year $10 million contract at WNYW-TV. He was one of the hirings of Dianne Doctor, who had been his previous boss at WNBC. This move allowed Rosenfield to become lead male anchor at a local New York station, which would not have happened if he remained at WNBC (where longtime anchor Chuck Scarborough is locked in as anchor at 11pm for years to come). Between June 2005 and April 2006, Rosenfield anchored CBS 2 News at 5 and CBS 2 News at 11 with Roz Abrams. In April 2006 he dropped the 5PM newscast and joined Dana Tyler at 6PM, while also keeping the 11PM with Dana. Roz had moved to noon and 5PM (but is now no longer at the station). In June 2007, he and Dana Tyler were reassigned to the noon and 6pm newscasts at WCBS by new station managers. In May 2008, the same producers that demoted the seasonal news reporter decided to let him go as the noon and 6PM newscaster. After May 22's 6pm newscast, Rosenfield will be leaving the station, all without another position anywhere else. The station has decided to let him go as a part of major CBS cuts (political reporter Andrew Kirtzman was let go in March; Roz Abrams was let go for similar reasons in 2006). As the station was in breach of his contract (Chris Wragge co-anchors the 11PM newscasts with Kristine Johnson, taking the title from Rosenfield last year), it was considered a matter of time before Rosenfield would leave the station. On June 1, 2012, it was announced that Rosenfield will be joining WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. as a weekend news anchor, effective June 4.

Dinara is the longest massif within karstic mountain chain of the western Balkan peninsula. Troglav is located in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is named after Triglav, Slavic god. The name literally means \\"three headed\\". The Troglav group is around 30 km long and around 15 km wide, making it the largest in the range. On the northwestern side, it is separated from the Dinara group by the Privija pass (1230 m) and on the southeast from the Kame≈°nica group by Vaganj (1173 m) road pass, which connects Sinj in Croatia with Livno in Bosnia. On the northeastern, Bosnian side, lies the huge Livno karstic field (Livanjsko Polje; 700 m), which is 65 km long. On the southwestern, Croatian side, there is the Cetina river valley with 15 km long Peruƒáa Lake (Peruƒáko jezero). The south-western slopes (Croatian side) ascend in a few steps. The first step rises up to around 1500‚Äì1600 m: up to 1100‚Äì1200 m slope is forested, mostly with oak and hornbeam, while the area above is grassy. Behind is a large depression, which is a labyrinth of peaks up to 1700 m, ridges and plateaux, which are strewn with funnel-shaped basins. On the part of the plateau called Vje≈°tiƒçja Gora (around 1400 m), south of Troglav, there is a large complex of beech forest, which stands out against the background of grass and stone. Behind this area, the main ridge rises. From the border with the Dinara group, the main ridge gradually rises up to the summit of Troglav. Thereafter, the slopes gradually descend towards Vaganj pass, while the pasture area between them widens. Peak Troglav (red triangle) and Peruƒáa Lake glanced from mountain Svilaja in Croatia. The north-eastern slopes (Bosnian side) are much steeper and mostly forested with beech and spruce. They mostly descend steeply, without steps, towards Livanjsko Polje field and end abruptly. A few kilometres north of Troglav, the only level ground appears and it contains the Velike Poljanice complex of meadows. On the northeastern part of the group, between Bat (1851 m) and Bunjevaƒçko Brdo (1849 m) groups of peaks, there is huge undulating grassy plateau, a few kilometres long and wide. The average altitude of the area is over 1600 m, and the region was glaciated during the ice ages.

Unlike the majority of the international mountaineering associations, the Association's remit extends to speleology, climbing, orienteering and mountain rescue. The Association is responsible for the maintenance of mountain huts and paths in Croatia, and is the publisher of the magazine Hrvatski planinar (The Croatian Mountaineer) and of other promotional materials. Through schools and courses it provides relevant professional education and training. It is a comprehensive source of information of all kinds relating to Croatian mountains and mountaineering. The operations of the Croatian Mountaineering Association are managed by its Executive Committee and its professional work is carried out through the commissions for: *Mountain Rescue; * Guiding; *Caving; * Alpinism; * Competition Climbing; *Orienteering; * Promotion & Publications; * Mountain Paths; * Environment; * Awards; * Husbandry; * Legal matters; * History of Mountaineering. Members of the Association and members of the UIAA have a 50% discount on the cost of a night's accommodation in all huts in Croatia. Currently the Association numbers some 20,000 registered members from over 200 clubs and regional associations. The predecessor organization Croatian Climbing Society () was founded in 1874, which puts the Croats among the first seven nations in the world with a climbing organization. Organised climbing activity in Croatia was directed in its early days towards scientific research into the natural features of the mountains, rather than towards the conquest of peaks as an end in itself. This focus was one reason for the extent to which leading university professors and scientists were represented in the membership of the Society in the 20th century.

Born in Stuttgart, Bracher was awarded a Ph.D. in the classics by the University of T√ºbingen in 1948 and subsequently studied at Harvard University from 1949 to 1950. During World War II, he served in the Wehrmacht and was captured by the Americans while serving in Tunisia in 1943. Bracher taught at the Free University of Berlin from 1950 to 1958 and at the University of Bonn since 1959. In 1951 Bracher married Dorothee Schleicher, the niece of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. They had two children.Ruud van Dijk, \\"Bracher, Karl Dietrich,\\" in Kelly Boyd, ed., The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, Vol. 1, London: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999, pp. 111‚Äì112.  Historical views  = Researching the collapse of Weimar = Bracher was mainly concerned with the problems of preserving and developing democracy. Bracher was consistent in all his works in arguing for the value of human rights, pluralism and constitutional values, together with urging that Germans align themselves with the democratic values of the West. He saw democracy as a frail institution and has argued that only a concerned citizenry can guarantee it. This theme began with Bracher's first book in 1948, Verfall und Fortschritt im Denken der fr√ºhen r√∂mischen Kaiserzeit which concerned the downfall of the Roman Republic and the rise of Augustus. His 1955 book Die Aufl√∂sung der Weimarer Republik (The Disintegration of the Weimar Republic) is his best known book, in which he ascribed the collapse of German democracy not to the Sonderweg (\\"special path\\" of German historical development) or other impersonal forces but to human action that followed conscious choice. In that book, Bracher rejected not only the Sonderweg thesis, but also the Marxist theory of National Socialism as the result of a capitalist \\"conspiracy\\", the theory that the Treaty of Versailles caused the collapse of the Weimar Republic, and the view that the Nazi dictatorship was simply the work of \\"fate\\". Bracher's methodology in Die Aufl√∂sung der Weimarer Republik involving a mixture of political science and history was considered to be highly innovative and controversial in the 1950s. The German historian Eberhard Kolb wrote Die Aufl√∂sung der Weimarer Republik was \\"still unsurpassed as a work of research\\" on the end of the Weimar Republic.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 132. Bracher wrote that though almost all Germans rejected the Treaty of Versailles, this dislike of Versailles had nothing with do with the coming of \\"presidential government\\" in March 1930 or rise of the Nazi Party starting with the September 1930 Reichstag election.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 169. Furthermore, Bracher wrote that under Weimar, the judicial system had already politicized as the judges, almost all of whom had begun their careers in the Imperial era, had a tendency to impose very lenient sentences for political crimes done in the name of the right.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 36. In Die Aufl√∂sung der Weimarer Republik, Bracher wrote the judiciary was in part responsible for the collapse of the Weimar republic, \\"contributing to its overthrow by authoritarian and totalitarian movements.\\" Bracher argued the beginning of the end of the Weimar Republic was the coming of \\"presidential government\\" in 1930 as starting with government of Heinrich Br√ºning, Chancellors not sought to govern via the Reichstag, instead using the \\"25/48/53 formula\\", which was legal, but violated the spirit of the constitution as Article 54 had explicitly stated the Chancellor and his cabinet were responsible to the Reichstag. Bracher maintained that the end of German democracy was not inevitable, but instead was due to conscious choices coupled with \\"momentous errors and failures\\" made by Germany's leaders, especially President Paul von Hindenburg. In Die Aufl√∂sung der Weimarer Republik, Bracher argued the \\"collapse\\" of the republic went through several stages: *The \\"loss of power\\" with Br√ºning as the cabinet governed only with Article 48, instead of the Reichstag.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 110. *The \\"power vacuum\\" with Franz von Papen and Kurt von Schleicher as democracy was gutted, but neither men could build a new system in their short time in office. *The \\"seizure of power\\" by the National Socialists in 1933. Bracher in writing of a \\"loss of power\\" and a \\"power vacuum\\" was referring to the decay of the democratic system, not a weakening of the state.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 111. Kolb noted in the years 1930‚Äì33, the Reichswehr, the bureaucracy, the police and above all President von Hindenburg all saw a dramatic increase in their power, and what was happening in Germany in that period was the gradual collapse of the democratic system with policy decisions increasingly being made by the Reichswehr and the Kamarilla of President Hindenburg instead of the Reichstag. Bracher argued that the system of \\"presidential government\\" was intended to and had the effect of weakening democracy, and that in no way was \\"presidential government\\" forced on Hindenburg and his Chancellors by an unmanageable crisis.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 pages 132‚Äì33. Bracher's thesis that Heinrich Br√ºning and even more so, his successor Franz von Papen had gutted German democracy involved him in a dispute with Werner Conze, a prominent Nazi historian under the Third Reich who emerged as a leading conservative historian in West Germany in the 1950s.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 133. In a series of articles published in the 1950s‚Äì60s, Conze argued that by 1929‚Äì1930 that German politics had become so dysfunctional that Hindenburg had no other choice, but to reluctantly bring in \\"presidential government\\" as the only to provide Germany with any sort of government, and that Br√ºning's governing via Article 48 was only a temporary measure intended to save democracy from the crisis caused by the Great Depression. In reply, Bracher wrote a series of article documenting that the plans for \\"presidential government\\" went back much to 1926 at least, and argued that there was no unmanageable crisis with parliamentary government in 1930 that made \\"presidential government\\" unavoidable.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 pages 179‚Äì180. Bracher forcefully argued that was no structural crisis in 1929‚Äì30 so severe that Hindenburg had to turn to \\"presidential government\\" as Conze was claiming, instead arguing that Hindenburg, his kamarilla, and the Reichswehr had been seeking long before the Great Depression to do away with democracy.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 180. In this regard, Bracher pointed out that General Kurt von Schleicher and Heinrich Br√ºning had worked out the plan for a \\"presidential government\\" by April 1929, and it was only Hindenburg's desire to have the government of Hermann M√ºller pass the Young Plan, which its turn was delayed by the Young Plan referendum of November 1929, that gave M√ºller almost an extra year in office. Bracher's thesis about the Br√ºning government as the first step towards dissolving democracy instead of an effort to save it as maintained by Conze, was greatly supported by the posthumous publication of Br√ºning's memoirs in 1970. Br√ºning, a conservative Catholic who never married and is not known to had a relationship with any women during the course of his life, revealed himself in his memoirs to be a man with an unhealthy emotional dependence on Hindenburg, to whom he was slavishly devoted and whom he regarded in homoerotic terms as the epitome of German masculinity and strength. Br√ºning openly admitted in his memoirs that the purpose of the \\"presidential government\\" was to do away with democracy and restore the monarchy by bringing back the exiled Wilhelm II, and complained at much length about how unfair it was that Schleicher had turned Hindenburg against him in the spring of 1932, leading to the president to fire him and replace him with Papen. It is noteworthy that Br√ºning did not object to Papen's policies in his memoirs, but rather to the fact that he would have carried out the same policies if only his beloved Field Marshal Hindenburg had given him the chance, instead of firing him in May 1932. Through Bracher won the debate with Conze, as late as 1971 Bracher deplored the tendency to take \\"a conservative and all too benevolent view of the presidential regime\\" as an attempt to save democracy.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 181. After the publication of Br√ºning's memoirs, which largely confirmed Bracher's thesis, Bracher wrote that the coming of presidential government was \\"not a move to save democracy, but part of a conscious plan to bring about a right-wing regime independent of party and parliament and to keep the Social Democrats out of power...Br√ºning's policy oscillated between the defense of a bureaucratic version of a state based on the rule of law, and paving the way for a dictatorship...He was not...the last chancellor before the break-up of the Weimar Republic, but the first chancellor in the process of destroying German democracy\\".Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 182. In a survey of the historiography of the Weimar republic, Kolb wrote that research since the 1970s has confirmed Bracher's damning picture of Br√ºning that he had first offered in 1955, when the evidence for it was weaker. Bracher sharply criticized the Social Democrats for not resisting the Preu√üenschlag launched by Franz von Papen that saw the Reichswehr oust the Social Democratic government of Otto Braun.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 185 Bracher wrote through the Reichswehr would had probably crushed any resistance, but: > \\"there remained the possibility of a lasting demonstration, a manifestation > of the unbroken will of democracy to assert itself against a temporarily > superior force. This might, beyond all justified practical calculations, > have make it possible to save the democratic consciousness from the > psychological and moral collapse of the republican forces; it made have made > the way harder for the new rulers; delayed future developments and lessened > their effects\\".Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 > pages 185. Bracher wrote that up until July 1932, those Germans who believed in democracy had high spirits and were full of fighting determination to take a stand, and after the Preu√üenschlag, the same people became demoralized and passive, feeling that they were playing in a game whose rules were rigged against them, losing their fighting spirit. Bracher's views about the \\"Rape of Prussia\\" as Papen's coup was also known involved him in heated debate with Arnold Brecht, who maintained that nothing could be done to oppose the Preu√üenschlag as that would mean breaking the law.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 pages 133. Bracher in his turn argued that Papen's reasons for his coup-namely the Social Democrats and the Communists were about to merge into a \\"united left\\" to start a Marxist revolution in Germany-were patently absurd, and given that Papen's intention was to dissolve democracy, that there are times when it is acceptable to break the law. Bracher argued that Brecht's thesis that resistance to Papen's coup was impossible because it would have meant breaking the law was just an excuse for passivity. Historians have generally agreed with Bracher's thesis that there are times when in the face of injustice committed by those who hold power that it is acceptable to break the law, and that the Preu√üenschlag was one of those times when illegality in defense of democracy would have been justified. = 1960s = In Bracher's opinion, through it was human choices that led to the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the National Socialist period, the roots of National Socialism can be traced back towards the v√∂lkisch ideology of 19th century Germany and Austria-Hungary, which found their fullest expression in the personality of Adolf Hitler.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London : Arnold ; New York page 44. Likewise, Bracher complained that too many Germans were willing during the Weimar-Nazi time periods to subscribe to a \\"readiness for acclamatory agreement and pseudo- military obedience to a strong authoritarian state\\".Marrus, Michael The Holocaust In History Toronto: Key Porter, 2000 page 85. Through Bracher was opposed to the Sonderweg interpretation of German history, he did believe in a special German mentality (Sonderbewusstsein) that made the Third Reich possible.Lukacs, John The Hitler of History, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997 page 201. Bracher wrote that: > \\"The German \\"Sonderweg\\" should be limited to the era of the Third Reich, but > the strength of the particular German mentality [Sonderbewusstsein] that had > arisen already with its opposition to the French Revolution and grew > stronger after 1870 and 1918 must be emphasized. Out of its exaggerated > perspectives (and, I would add, rhetoric) it become a power in politics, out > a myth reality. The road from democracy to dictatorship was not a particular > German case, but the radical nature of the National Socialist dictatorship > corresponded to the power of the German ideology that in 1933‚Äì1945 became a > political and totalitarian reality\\" The Sonderbewusstsein Bracher referred to was the original theory of the Sonderweg, namely the idea of the Prussian-German state as the great Central European power neither of the West nor of the East, but rather was something special and unique; this ideology emphasised opposition to democracy as part of its opposition to \\"Western civilization\\". Another well-known book associated with Bracher was the 1960 monograph co-written with Wolfgang Sauer and Gerhard Schulz Die nationalsozialistische Machtergreifung (The National Socialist Seizure of Power), which described in considerable detail the Gleichschaltung of German life in 1933‚Äì1934. In a review of Die nationalsozialistische Machtergreifung, the American historian Walter Laqueur praised Bracher, Sauer and Schulz for their refusal to engage in apologetics, and willingness to ask tough questions about the conduct of Germans under the Nazi regime.Laqueur, Walter Review of Die nationalsozialistische Machtergreifung: Studien zur Errichtung des totalitaren Herrschaftssystems in Deutschland 1933/34 pages 235‚Äì236 from International Affairs, Volume 37, Issue # 2 April 1961 page 235. In the same review, Laqueur expressed regret that books like William L. Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich were best- sellers, while a book like Die nationalsozialistische Machtergreifung, which Laqueur regarded as infinitely better work of scholarship then Shirer's book was unlikely ever to be translated into English, let alone become a bestseller.Laqueur, Walter Review of Die nationalsozialistische Machtergreifung: Studien zur Errichtung des totalitaren Herrschaftssystems in Deutschland 1933/34 pages 235‚Äì236 from International Affairs, Volume 37, Issue # 2 April 1961 page 236. Bracher advocated the view that Nazi Germany was a totalitarian regime, through Bracher maintained that the \\"totalitarian typology\\" as developed by Carl Joachim Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski was too rigid, and that totalitarian models needed to be based upon careful empirical research.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London : Arnold ; New York page 25. In Bracher's view, Friedrich's and Brzezinski's work failed to take into account the \\"revolutionary dynamic\\", which Bracher argued was the \\"core principle\\" of totalitarism. For Bracher, the essence of totalitarism was the total claim to control and remake all aspects of society together with an all-embracing ideology, the value on authoritarian leadership, and the pretence of the common identity of state and society, which distinguished the totatitarian \\"closed\\" understanding of politics from the \\"open\\" democratic understanding. In Bracher's view, \\"politics is the struggle for the power of the state\\", and in his opinion, the traditional methods of the historian have to be supplemented by the methods of political science to properly understand political history.Iggers, Georg The German Conception of History, Middletown: Connecticut; Wesleyan University Press, 1968 page 266. Speaking of historical work in his own area of speciality, namely the Weimar-Nazi periods, Bracher stated: > \\"It was not with Himmler, Bormann, and Heydrich, also not with the National > Socialist Party, but with Hitler that the German people identified itself > enthusiastically. In this there exists an essential problem, especially for > German historians...To identify the sources of this fateful mistake of the > past and to research it without minimizing it remains a task of German > historical scholarship. Ignoring it means the loss of its commitment to > truth.\\"Lukacs, John The Hitler of History, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997 > pages 202‚Äì203. Bracher was highly critical of the Marxist view of the Third Reich, which sees the Nazi leadership as puppets of Big Business.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London : Arnold ; New York page 51. In Bracher's opinion, the exact opposite was the case with a \\"primacy of politics\\" being exercised with business subordinate to the Nazi regime rather than a \\"primacy of economics\\" as maintained by Marxist historians. Bracher argued that Nazi actions were dictated by Nazi ideological theory, that business interests were just as much subordinate to the dictatorship as any other section of society, and that since Nazi actions were often irrational from a purely economic point of view, a \\"primacy of politics\\" prevailed. Against the functionalist view of the Third Reich mostly associated with left-wing historians, Bracher was to write that it was an attempt to: > \\"turn against the \\"old-liberal\\" totalitarianism theory and talk about a > relativizing interpretation, which emphasizes the \\"improvisational\\" politics > of power and domination of National Socialism. Leftish interpretations would > like to leave behind the questions of guilt and responsibility in favor of a > more modern, realistic analysis. But in doing this they slide into the > danger of a newer underestimation and trivialization of National Socialism > itself. Their analysis also brings with it, in another way, the vague > leftist talk about fascism and reaction\\"Hildebrand, Klaus \\"He Who Wants to > Escape the Abysss Will Have to Sound It Very Prcisely: Is the New German > History Writing Revisionists?\\" pages 188‚Äì195 from Forever In The Shadow Of > Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, N.J. : Humanities Press, > 1993 page 190. In the 1960s, Bracher was a leading critic of the theory of generic fascism presented by Ernst Nolte. Bracher criticized the entire notion of generic fascism as intellectually invalid and argued that it was individual choice on the part of Germans as opposed to Nolte's philosophical view of the \\"metapolitical\\" that produced National Socialism.Maier, Charles The Unmasterable Past Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1988 pages 84‚Äì85, 87 & 100‚Äì101 Bracher's magnum opus, his 1969 book Die deutsche Diktatur (The German Dictatorship) was partly written to rebut Nolte's theory of generic fascism, and instead presented a picture of the National Socialist dictatorship as a totalitarian regime created and sustained by human actions.Maier, Charles The Unmasterable Past Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1988 pages 84‚Äì85 & 87 & 100‚Äì101 In Die deutsche Diktatur, Bracher rejected theories of generic fascism, and instead used totalitarianism theory and the methods of the social sciences to explain Nazi Germany.Maier, Charles The Unmasterable Past Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1988 page 101 As an advocate of history as a social science, Bracher took a strong dislike to Nolte's philosophical theories of generic fascism.Maier, Charles The Unmasterable Past Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1988 page 87 In a 1971 review, the American historian Lucy Dawidowicz called The German Dictatorship \\"...a work of unparalleled distinction, combing the most scrupulous objectivity with a passionate commitment to the democratic ethos\\".Dawidowicz, Lucy S. Review of The German Dictatorship: The Origins, Structure and Effects of National Socialism pages 91‚Äì93 from Commentary, Volume 52, Issue # 2, August 1971 page 91. In 1989, the British historian Richard J. Evans called The German Dictatorship a \\"valuable\\" bookEvans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, Pantheon: New York, 1989 page 186. Bracher often criticized the functionist-structuralist interpretation of the Third Reich championed by such scholars such as Martin Broszat and Hans Mommsen, and decried their view of Hitler as a ‚Äúweak dictator‚Äù. In Bracher's view, Hitler was the ‚ÄúMaster of the Third Reich‚Äù.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London : Arnold ; New York page 73. However, though Bracher argues that the F√ºhrer was the driving force behind the Third Reich, he was one of the first historians to argue that Nazi Germany was less well organized than the Nazis liked to pretend. In a 1956 essay, Bracher noted \\"the antagonism between rival agencies was resolved solely in the omnipotent key position of the F√ºhrer\\", which was the result of \\"...the complex coexistence and opposition of the power groups and from conflicting personal ties\\". Unlike the functionists, Bracher saw this disorganization as part of a conscious ‚Äúdivide and rule‚Äù strategy on the part of Hitler, and argued at no point was Hitler ever driven by pressure from below or had his power limited in any way. One area where Bracher is in agreement with the functionists concerns the highly ad hoc nature of decision-making in the Third Reich. Bracher commented that the Nazi regime \\"remained in a state of permanent improvisation\\".Marrus, Michael The Holocaust In History, Toronto: Key Porter, 2000 page 46. = 1970s = In a 1971 essay to mark the 100th anniversary of German unification, Bracher rejected the claim that Otto von Bismarck was the \\"grandfather\\" of the present-day Federal Republic, and argued that those historians who claimed that there was a line of continuity between Bismarck's Second Reich and the Federal Republic were entirely mistaken. Bracher maintained that the founding of the Federal Republic in 1949 was a decisive break with everything had happened before in German history.Gerwarth, Robert The Bismarck Myth: Weimar Germany and the Legacy of the Iron Chancellor, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 page 164. Bracher stated that the Federal Republic with its democracy, respect for the individual, equality of all citizens, rule of the law and its pluralist, tolerant society owned nothing to Bismarck's vision of a rigidly hierarchical society dominated by a militaristic, authoritarian state that existed to uphold the power of the Junkers.Gerwarth, Robert The Bismarck Myth: Weimar Germany and the Legacy of the Iron Chancellor, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 page 165. Bracher wrote that the success of the modern Federal Republic had nothing to do with the \\"Bismarckian tradition\\" and stated that the \\"destruction of the state of 1871\\" was \\"the premiss and starting point for a new German state altogether\\". Bracher maintained that \\"the second, finally successful democracy in Germany is unimaginable, impossible without the ultimate failure of the Reich of 1871\\". In an essay published in 1976 entitled \\"The Role of Hitler: Perspectives of Interpretation\\", Bracher argued that Hitler was too often underrated in his own time, and that those historians who rejected the totalitarian paradigm in favor of the fascist paradigm were in danger of making the same mistake. In Bracher's opinion, Hitler was a \\"world-historical\\" figure who served as the embodiment of the most radical type of German nationalism and a revolutionary of the most destructive kind, and that such was the force of Hitler's personality that it is correct to speak of National Socialism as \\"Hitlerism\\". In his essay, Bracher maintained that Hitler himself was in many ways something of an \\"unperson\\" devoid of any real interest for the biographer, but argued that these pedestrian qualities of Hitler led to him being underestimated first by rivals and allies in the Weimar Republic, and then on the international stage in the 1930s.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide, Harmondsworth, 1976 page 212. At the same time, Bracher warned of the apologetic tendencies of the ‚Äúdemonization\\" of Hitler which he accused historians like Gerhard Ritter of engaging in, which Bracher maintained allowed too many Germans to place the blame for Nazi crimes solely on the \\"demon\\" Hitler.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide, Harmondsworth, 1976 page 213. Through Bracher criticized the Great man theory of history as an inadequate historical explanation, Bracher argued that social historians who claim that social developments were more important than the role of individuals were mistaken.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide Harmondsworth, 1976 page 214. Bracher wrote about the \\"Hitler Wave\\" of the 1970s that the obsession with Hitler seemed odd given all of the dramatic events of the last thirty or so years such as the Cold War, the rise and decline of Stalinism, the Hungarian Uprising, the Suez War, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, where somehow Hitler, despite being dead, remained in \\"the background\\" of all these events.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide Harmondsworth, 1976 page 211. Bracher argued that the obsession with Hitler was due to the \\"inevitable and continuing sensational aspect caused by the excessive features of Hitlerism, which can be taken as a kind of modern Genghis Khanism or an example of that combination of cruel efficiency and superhuman will-power which frequently is identified as typically German, to be horrified or admired, or both simultaneously\\".Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide Harmondsworth, 1976 page 212. Bracher argued that Hitler represented a new type of leader quite divorced from the traditional standards of historical greatness established by 18th and 19th century historians as: \\"Hitler and, in his way, Stalin represent a new type of the great movement and party leader combining the qualities of fanatical ideological fixation and virtuoso mass demagogy, and replacing the traditional statesmen and warrior as the great type of historical figure\\". Writing in 1976, Bracher cautioned against a return to the \\"Great Man\\" school of history, warning that \\"Great Man\\" type histories were typical of totalitarian regimes as this concept of history as the \\"history of great men\\" was promoted not only in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, but \\"...also by communist regimes where, although quite contrary to their dogma of collectivism, it was in keeping with the psychology of mass mobilization by charismatic leadership. The great examples of this cult of leadership and pseudo-religious veneration and adoration are Lenin and Stalin and at present Mao and the North Korean demigod Kim Il Sung\\". However, at the same time, Bracher argued in totalitarian regimes, the position of the leader by its very definition meant that he had an oversized role in making history, thus making the study of the leader a prerequisite for understanding these regimes.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide Harmondsworth, 1976 pages 214‚Äì215. In Bracher's view, Hitler's rise was not inevitable, and the primary responsibility for the Chancellorship being given to Hitler on 30 January 1933 rested with the Kamarilla of President Paul von Hindenburg.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide Harmondsworth, 1976 page 217. Bracher wrote that had Hindenburg chosen differently from that the path that he did chose by appointing Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933 that German history would easily gone in a completely different direction, thus meaning that even through Hindenburg died in 1934, he must bear ultimate responsibility for everything that happened between 1933‚Äì45, for the appointment of Hitler was a purely a gratuitous act on Hindenburg's part that he did not have to do. However, Bracher argued that once Hitler had obtained power, he used his authority to carry out a comprehensive revolution that politically destroyed both Hitler's opponents such as the SPD and his allies such as the DNVP who sought to ‚Äútame‚Äù the Nazi movement. Bracher argued that because Hitler was so central to the Nazi movement that it led to the fate of National Socialism being so intertwined with Hitler's fate that it is right, as noted above, to speak of National Socialism as Hitlerism, and hence justifying Hitler's place in history as a person who by their actions decisively brought about events that otherwise would not had occurred.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide Harmondsworth, 1976 page 215. In addition, Bracher maintained that the importance of Hitler derived from his being the most effective exponent of an extremely radical type of racist German nationalism, which allowed for ideas that otherwise would be ignored by historians coming to a terrible fruition. Though Bracher argued that the work of Ralf Dahrendorf, David Schoenbaum, and Henry Ashby Turner about National Socialism in pursuit of anti-modern goals leading to an unintentional modernization of German society had merit, Bracher felt the question of modernization was too removed from the essence of National Socialism, which Bracher argued were the total revolutionary remodeling of the world along savagely racist and Social Darwinist lines.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide Harmondsworth, 1976 pages 220‚Äì221. In Bracher's opinion, the revolution Hitler sought to unleash was besides being one of racism gone mad, was also a moral revolution.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide Harmondsworth, 1976 page 222. Bracher argued that the Nazi revolution sought to destroy traditional values that society had valued such as friendship, kindness, and so forth, and replace them with values such as cruelty, brutality, and destruction.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide Harmondsworth, 1976 pages 222‚Äì223. Bracher argued that because Anti-Semitism was so crucial to Hitler's weltanschauung (worldview) and its consequences in the form of genocide for the Jews of Europe were such that this disapproves any notion of generic fascism because Bracher believes that theories of fascism cannot account for the Shoah.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide Harmondsworth, 1976 pages 217‚Äì218. Bracher argued that generic fascism theorists were guilty of indiscriminately lumping in too many disparate phenomena for the concept of fascism to be of any intellectual use, and of using the term fascist as a catch-all insult for anyone the left disliked. With respect to the genesis of The Holocaust, he is a confirmed Intentionalist. It is his position that the entire project of the genocide of European Jewry resulted from Adolf Hitler's anti-Semitic hatred. Bracher argued that the \\"one basic principle to which Hitler subscribed deeply, blindly and ruthlessly\\" was anti-Semitism. Bracher noted that the Shoah was so important to Hitler that during World War II, resources that might from a purely military point of view be better devoted to the war were instead turned towards genocide.Dawidowicz, Lucy S. Review of The German Dictatorship: The Origins, Structure and Effects of National Socialism pages 91‚Äì93 from Commentary, Volume 52, Issue # 2, August 1971 page 92. In 1981, the British Marxist historian Timothy Mason in his essay 'Intention and explanation: A Current controversy about the interpretation of National Socialism' from the book The \\"Fuehrer State\\" : Myth and reality coined the term \\"Intentionist\\" as part of an attack against Bracher and Klaus Hildebrand, both of whom Mason accused of focusing too much on Hitler as an explanation for the Holocaust. Bracher believed that totalitarianism, whether from the Left or Right, is the leading threat to democracy all over the world, and has argued that the differences between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were of degree, not kind. Bracher is opposed to the notion of generic fascism and has often urged scholars to reject \\"totalitarian\\" fascism theory as championed by the \\"radical-left\\" in favour of \\"democratic\\" totalitarian theory as a means of explaining the Nazi dictatorship.Burleigh, Michael & Wippermann, Wolfgang The Racial State : Germany 1933‚Äì1945, Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1991 page 20. In particular, Bracher has argued that Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany possessed such fundamental differences that any theory of generic fascism is not supported by the historical evidence. He is pro-American and was one of the few German professors to support fully the foreign policy of the United States during the Cold War. However, Bracher was in no way sympathetic towards Fascist Italy, writing about Benito Mussolini's rise: \\"Appealing to all classes by a combination of conservative and progressive, anti-communist and state socialist, reactionary and revolutionary aims\\" and making much use of \\"direct action\\", Mussolini \\"went to war with liberal democracy\\" in 1919.Kolb, Eberhard The Weimar Republic, London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 pages 54‚Äì55. Bracher was a consistent advocate of the values of the Federal Republic, and its American ally against the values of East Germany and its Soviet patron. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s he often attacked left-wing and New Left intellectuals in particular for comparing the actions of the United States in the Vietnam War and the West German state to Nazi Germany.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London : Arnold ; New York page 15; Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"The Role of Hitler\\" pages 211‚Äì225 from Fascism: A Reader's Guide, edited by Walter Laqueur, Harmondsworth, 1976 pages 212‚Äì213 & 218. For Bracher, these attacks were both an absurd trivialization of Nazi crimes and a sinister attempt to advance the cause of Communism. Bracher argued that the defeatist and uncertain mood of the 1970s‚Äì80s in West Germany was not unlike the mood of the 1920s‚Äì30s. In 1969‚Äì74, Bracher supported the Social Democratic-Free Democrat government of Chancellor Willy Brandt and his policy of Ostpolitik, arguing that it long overdue that the Federal Republic recognize the Oder-Neisse Line. By the mid-1970s, Bracher turned against the Social Democrats, arguing that far too many people in West Germany were na√Øve and blithely dismissive of the threat by Soviet Communism. Bracher always saw himself as a liberal, opposed to totalitarianism of both left and right, a standpoint that led him to attack both conservatives and Communists. In his 1976 book Zeitgeschichtliche Kontroversen, Bracher criticized the Marxist-New Left interpretation of the Nazi period under the grounds that in such an interpretation \\"the ideological and totalitarian dimension of National Socialism shrinks to such an extent that the barbarism of 1933‚Äì45 disappears as a moral phenomenon\\", which Bracher felt meant that \\"...a new wave of trivialization or even apologetics was beginning\\".Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London : Arnold ; New York page 18. In his 1977 essay entitled \\"Zeitgeschichte im Wandel der Interpretationen\\" published in the Historische Zeitschrift journal, Bracher argued that the student protests of the late 1960s had resulted in a \\"Marxist renaissance\\" with the \\"New Left\\" exercising increasing control over the university curricula.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London : Arnold ; New York page 15. Through Bracher felt that some of the resulting work was of value, too much of the resulting publications were in his opinion executed with \\"crude weapons\\" in which \\"the ideological struggle was carried out on the back and in the name of scholarship\\" with a corrosive effect on academic standards. Bracher wrote the student protests of the late 1960s had \\"politicized and often...objectionably distorted\\" the work of historians.Maier, Charles The Unmasterable Past, Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press, 1988 page 90. In his 1978 book Schl√ºsselw√∂rter in der Geschichte, Bracher warned of the \\"totalitarian temptation\\" which he associated with the New Left, above all with the Red Army Faction terrorist group was a serious threat to West German democracy, and called upon scholars to do their part to combat such trends before it was too late. Bracher warned against \\"Peace\\" and \\"Green\\" movements operating outside of the political system offering a radical version of an alternative utopian system which he warned if the crisis in confidence in democracy continued could lead to a gradual undermining of democracy in Germany. In their turn, elements of the West German Left attacked Bracher as a neo-Nazi and branded him an \\"American stooge\\". In particular, Bracher warned of the \\"tendency, through theorizing and ideologizing alienation from the history of persons and events, to show and put into effect as the dominant leading theme the contemporary criticism of capitalism and democracy\\".Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London : Arnold page 16. Along the same lines, Bracher criticized the return to what he regarded as the crude Comintern theories of the 1920-1930s which labeled democracy as a form of \\"late capitalist\\" and \\"late bourgeois\\" rule, and of the New Left practice of referring to the Federal Republic as a \\"restorative\\" Nazi state.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London : Arnold page 15. = 1980s = In the introduction to his 1982 book Zeit der Ideologien (Age of Ideologies), Bracher wrote: \\"When the realization of high- pitched political expectations was found to come up against certain limits, there was a revival of the confrontation, especially painful in Germany and one that was generally believed to have been overcome\\". Bracher attacked Communism under the grounds that its claim to have \\"scientifically\\" worked out the laws of history was the source of \\"its great strength vis-√†-vis supporters and sympathizers but also its extremely intolerant and coercive character.‚Äù Bracher wrote: ‚ÄúCommunist policies are something mystical, something surpassing the rational capability of the individual, something fully accessible only to the collective and its leadership,‚Äù which promoted itself as ‚Äúan exclusively informed elite.‚Äù As part of his critique of Communism, Bracher wrote: > \\"No limits were to that elite‚Äôs supranational competence‚Ä¶. It is this moral > and intellectual totalitarianism pseudo-scientifically justified and > politically enforced, that represents both the strength and the weakness of > communist ideology. It was able to bring salvation from doubts in a modern > complex world, but it was bound, time and again, to come into conflict with > the facts of that complexity.‚Äù During the Historikerstreit (Historians' Dispute) of the 1986‚Äì88, Bracher argued in a letter to the editor of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published on 6 September 1986 that nothing new was being presented by either side.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"Letter to the Editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, September 6, 1986\\" pages 72‚Äì73 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, N.J. : Humanities Press, 1993 page 72 Bracher wrote that he approved of Joachim Fest's essay ‚ÄúEncumbered Remembrance‚Äú about the moral equivalence of Nazi and Communist crimes, through he remained pointly silent about Fest's support for the theory of Ernst Nolte of a ‚Äúcasual nexus‚Äù with German National Socialism as an extreme, but understandable response to Soviet Communism. Bracher argued that \\"...the \\"totalitarian\\" force of these two ideologies [Communism and National Socialism] seized the whole human and seduced and enslaved him\\". Bracher accused both J√ºrgen Habermas and Ernst Nolte of both \\"...tabooing the concept of totalitarianism and inflating the formula of fascism\\". Bracher complained about the \\"politically polarized\\" dispute that was blinding historians to the \\"comparability\\" of Communism and National Socialism Bracher ended his letter by writing that neither National Socialism nor Communism lost none of \\"...their respective \\"singular\\" inhumanity by comparisons. Neither a national nor a socialist apologetic can be supported on that basis\\". In the Historikerstreit, Bracher mostly stayed on the sidelines, and took a pox-on- both-houses approach.Maier, Charles The Unmasterable Past, Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press, 1988 page 85. Writing on 14 March 1987, Bracher stated he regarded the Historikerstreit as typical of the Doppelb√∂digkeit (ambiguities) that Germans felt towards their recent history. Bracher argued that the Federal Republic was one of two rival German states competing for the loyalty of the German people, the successor state to two regimes that failed, and inhabited by two generations with different memories of the past. Bracher wrote that for Germans: \\"The present dispute concerns not only the orientation and the meaning of a totalitarian \\"past\\", which is not easy to historicize, but does not simply pass away despite temporal distance\\". Bracher argued that given the \\"burden of the past\\", West Germany could all too easily slide into dictatorship Bracher saw the major threat to West German democracy as coming from the left. Bracher accused the peace and Green movements as hovering \\"in the borderline between democracy and dictatorship\\", and warned that the radical left-peace-Green movements could easily become the instruments of a \\"pseudo-religious concepts of salvation\\" that would lead to a return to totalitarianism in West Germany. Bracher claimed that the situation in the late 1980s was the same as in the late 1960s \\"when we critics of an all-too-general concept of fascism were opposed by a front from Nolte via Habermas to the extraparliamentary opposition\\". Later in the 1980s, Bracher defined totalitarianism as any state system that featured absolute ideology that allowed no rivals; a mass movement that was hierarchically organized and under state control; control of the media; and state control of the economy.Laqueur, Walter The Fate of the Revolution, New York: Collier Books, 1987 page 241. Moreover, Bracher contended that totalitarianism was not just a product of the interwar period, but instead very much a product of modern times with modern technology allowing for greater possibilities for totalitarian control of society than what existed in the 1920s, 30s and 40s.Laqueur, Walter The Fate of the Revolution, New York: Collier Books, 1987 page 242. Bracher argued that the essential divining line in the world today was not between left and right or between socialism and capitalism, but between dictatorship and democracy. Bracher criticized those left-wing intellectuals who damned democracies like the United States as for being capitalist while praising those dictatorships that were ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù like Communist Cuba as holding morally dishonest values. Bracher emerged as one of the first proponents of the idea of the Federal Republic as a \\"post-national democracy\\" or what become known as \\"constitutional patriotism\\", a new definition of what it meant to be German.M√ºller, Jan-Werner Another Country: German Intellectuals, Unification, and National Identity, Harvard: Yale University Press, 2000 page 98. Bracher argued that in the aftermath of the Third Reich, the traditional German nationalism based on a \\"blood-and-soil\\" ideology that defined Deutschtum (Germanness) in racial terms was too morally compromised by its association with Nazism, and the values promoted by the old Prussian-Imperial Obrigkeitsstaat (authoritarian state) were not suitable for a democratic society, thus requiring something new. Instead, Bracher called for a new German nationalism that defined itself in terms of its commitment to democracy and made upholding the humanist values of the 1949 Basic Law (the constitution) the centerpiece of what it meant to be German. Bracher argued contra the traditional \\"national patriotism\\" with loyalty to the nation that with \\"constitutional patriotism\\" the primary loyalty of Germans was to be towards the Basic Law and its values, creating a new sense of German national identity based upon a sense of loyalty to the Basic Law that would to apply to all regardless of sex, religion, skin color or ethnicity. Many supporters of \\"national patriotism\\" like the historian Hagen Schulze argued Bracher's \\"constitutional patriotism\\" was too dry and abstract, maintaining that Germans needed a stronger glue than loyalty to the Basic Law to have a sustainable sense of national identity, thus requiring loyalty to the nation. In the 1970s‚Äì80s, Bracher published a series of essays calling for \\"constitutional patriotism\\" and a \\"post-national democracy\\" that redefined Deutschtum in terms of republican belonging to a democratic state and rejected the old definitions of the nation-state.M√ºller, Jan-Werner Another Country: German Intellectuals, Unification, and National Identity, Harvard: Yale University Press, 2000 page 138. Such was the success of Bracher's efforts that many younger Germans starting in the 1980s embraced his idea of \\"constitutional patriotism\\" as a way of affirming one's pride in being German. In 1989‚Äì1990, Bracher welcomed the fall of the East German dictatorship and German reunification. Bracher did not feel the East German SED dictatorship was morally equivalent to the Nazi regime, but he argued that the memory of how awful the Communist regime in East Germany should be preserved to prevent any return to Communism. = 1990s = In the 1990s, Bracher argued that through the prospects of democracy against totalitarianism had much improved, he warned that this was no time for triumphalism. In 1992, Bracher wrote that democracy is a state \\"of self- limitation and insight into the imperfection of man, just as dictatorship is the rule of man's ideological arrogance.\\" Bracher contended that through there were better chances for democracy in the post-1989 world then was in the \\"short 20th century\\" of 1914‚Äì89, there only was the hard work of building and maintaining a civil society ahead for the world, and this task could never be completed. In his 1992 book Turning Points in Modern Times Bracher attacked Nolte for his claims that German National Socialism was merely a ‚Äúmirror image‚Äù of the Soviet Union.Bracher, Karl Dietrich Turning Points In Modern Times, Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press, 1995 p. 141 Bracher wrote that Nolte's work ‚Äútrivializes‚Äù the vicious racism that Bracher stated was at the heart of National Socialism by suggesting that it was just a \\"copy\\" of Soviet Communism and thus not as evil as the Soviet original.Bracher, Karl Dietrich Turning Points In Modern Times, Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press, 1995 p. 35 In a 2003 interview with the Der Spiegel newsmagazine, Bracher was highly critical of Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der‚Äôs opposition to the Iraq war, and warned against using anti- Americanism to win elections as potentially damaging Germany‚Äôs relations with the United States, a development that Bracher much deplored‚Äù. He died on 19 September 2016 at the age of 94. The American historian Jeffrey Herf wrote in an obituary: > \\"The complaints about democracy and liberalism that Bracher examined in The > German Dictatorship find echoes in our own time. Our institutions are far > more stable than those of the Weimar Republic, but the appeal of > authoritarianism and conspiracy-theorizing is growing in Western politics. > Therefore Bracher‚Äôs work on how democracy was destroyed in Germany in the > 1930s remains uncomfortably relevant. Moreover, the era of totalitarian > ideology and politics did not end with the collapse of Communism in Europe. > Using Bracher‚Äôs criteria, it continues, most importantly in the Islamist > movements that have fueled the terrorism of recent decades. Totalitarianism > has changed both its geographical location and its cultural coordinates, but > in its inhumanity and irrationality it merits comparison with its 20th- > century predecessors. Here, too, Karl Bracher‚Äôs work will remain important > for years to come both for historians of the Nazi and Communist > dictatorships and for advocates of liberal democracy in a world that faces > multiple illiberal challenges.\\"  Honors  * Emeritus of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. * Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. * Member of the American Philosophical Society. * Member of the Historische Kommission zu Berlin. * Member of the Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Sprache und Dichtung. * Member of the Nordrhein-Westf√§lische Akademie.

To Friends, the concept of integrity includes personal wholeness and consistency as well as honesty and fair dealings. From personal and inward integrity flow the outward signs of integrity, which include honesty and fairness. It is not only about telling the truth but also about applying ultimate truth to each situation. For example, Friends (Quakers) believe that integrity requires avoiding statements that are technically true but misleading. The word testimony is used to refer to the ways in which Friends testify or bear witness to their faith in their everyday lives. In this context, the word testimony refers not to Friends' underlying beliefs about truth and integrity but their committed action to promote and act in truthful and integral ways, which arises out of their beliefs. Also known as the Testimony of Truth, or Truth Testimony, the essence of the Testimony of Integrity is placing God at the center of one's life. To Friends, integrity is in choosing to follow the leading of the Spirit despite the challenges and urges to do otherwise. That testimony has led to Friends having a reputation for being honest and fair in their dealings with others. It has led them to give proper credit to others for their contributions and to accept responsibility for their own actions. In those legal systems, if it is allowed, rather than swearing oaths in a court of law, Friends prefer to affirm. In England, that has been the case since 1695.definition and etymology in dictionary.com Accessed 6 April 2007 Among some early Friends, the testimony led them to refuse to participate in drama, and they stated that to pretend they were someone else was to deny their integrity.  Oaths and fair- dealing  Early Friends believed that an important part of Jesus' message was how we treat our fellow human beings. They felt that honest dealing with others meant more than avoiding direct lies. Friends continue to believe that it is important not to mislead others, even if the words used are all technically truthful. Early Friends refused to swear oaths, even in courtrooms, believing that one must speak truth at all times, and the act of swearing to it implied different standards of truth with and without oaths. That doctrine is attributed to Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount (specifically Matthew 5:34-37). Some Friends have accepted the use of \\"affirmations\\" rather than oaths, believing that \\"taking oaths implies a double standard of truth\\".  Spiritual aspect of truth and integrity  The essence of testimony to integrity is placing God at the center of one's life. Quakers believe that the Spirit is in everyone. Integrity means focusing and spending time listening to the small voice of the Spirit and being open to being led by it, whether the Spirit is speaking within oneself or through another. Giving testimony to truth and integrity also means refusing to place things other than God at the center of one's life, whether one's own self, possessions, the regard of others, belief in principles (such as rationality, progress, or justice) or something else. It is the understanding that even good things are no longer good when they supplant God as one's center. On the other hand, some Quakers believe that to put integrity and efforts to build it at the center of one's life to put God at the center of one's life.  Examples of testimony to truth and integrity  George Fox refusing to take oath, 1663 Since early in the foundation of the Religious Society of Friends, Quakers have refused to take oaths - they say simply ‚Äúyea‚Äù or ‚Äúnay‚Äù to questions rather than swearing or taking an oath. They recognized the truth of Jesus‚Äôs teaching (Matthew 5:34-37) that swearing is often a way to avoid telling the truth while appearing to do so. A person‚Äôs word should be accepted based on his or her reputation for truth-telling rather than on his or her taking an oath or swearing to tell the truth. This was embodied in their quote \\"let your yea be yea and your nay be nay\\",Religion in the Contemporary World: A Sociological Introduction By Alan E. Aldridge, p49 from . Later, when many Quakers became successful in business (such as Cadbury, Rowntree, Fry, etc.), they set a fixed price for goods on sale rather than setting a high price and haggling over it with the buyer. Quakers believed that it is dishonest to set an unfair price to begin with. By having fair fixed prices, Quakers soon developed a reputation as honest businessmen, and many people came to trust them in trading and in banking. Thus, the Quaker name or image was adopted by business ventures of non-Quakers, such as oats and oil companies, to imply their fair dealing in price and quality. Other examples of ways in which Friends testify or bear witness to truth and integrity include such practices as: *making sure that one's words and actions flow from one's beliefs *speaking the truth, even when it is difficult *paying people fair wages for their work *giving one's employer the right amount of labor for one's pay *saying difficult things with grace and tact *receiving difficult sayings gracefully *guarding one's reputation for honesty, fairness, and fidelity *taking responsibility for one's actions and their results *fulfilling one's commitments *taking care of items entrusted to one *being open to the ideas of others but not being too easily swayed by them *confronting lapses in integrity in oneself and in others *giving credit to others for their contributions *assessing people and situations fairly and accurately *avoiding spending beyond one's means through the use of credit See also *  Sources  *Cooper, Wilmer.

On the other hand, proton reduction () is coupled to the oxidation of electron donors such as ferredoxin (FNR), and serves to dispose excess electrons in cells (essential in pyruvate fermentation). Both low-molecular weight compounds and proteins such as FNRs, cytochrome c3, and cytochrome c6 can act as physiological electron donors or acceptors for hydrogenases.  Structural classification  It has been estimated that 99% of all organisms utilize dihydrogen, H2. Most of these species are microbes and their ability to use H2 as a metabolite arises from the expression of H2 metalloenzymes known as hydrogenases. Hydrogenases are sub-classified into three different types based on the active site metal content: iron-iron hydrogenase, nickel-iron hydrogenase, and iron hydrogenase. The structures of the active sites of the three types of hydrogenase enzymes. All hydrogenases catalyze reversible H2 uptake, but while the [FeFe] and [NiFe] hydrogenases are true redox catalysts, driving H2 oxidation and proton (H+) reduction (equation ), the [Fe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible heterolytic cleavage of H2 shown by reaction (). Until 2004, the [Fe]-only hydrogenase was believed to be \\"metal-free\\". Then, Thauer et al. showed that the metal-free hydrogenases in fact contain iron atom in its active site. As a result, those enzymes previously classified as \\"metal-free\\" are now named [Fe]-only hydrogenases. This protein contains only a mononuclear Fe active site and no iron-sulfur clusters, in contrast to the [FeFe] hydrogenases. [NiFe] and [FeFe] hydrogenases have some common features in their structures: Each enzyme has an active site and a few Fe-S clusters that are buried in protein. The active site, which is believed to be the place where catalysis takes place, is also a metallocluster, and each metal is coordinated by carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide (CN‚àí) ligands. = [NiFe] hydrogenase = Crystal structure of [NiFe] hydrogenase The [NiFe] hydrogenases are heterodimeric proteins consisting of small (S) and large (L) subunits. The small subunit contains three iron-sulfur clusters while the large subunit contains the active site, a nickel-iron centre which is connected to the solvent by a molecular tunnel. In some [NiFe] hydrogenases, one of the Ni-bound cysteine residues is replaced by selenocysteine. On the basis of sequence similarity, however, the [NiFe] and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases should be considered a single superfamily. To date, periplasmic, cytoplasmic, and cytoplasmic membrane-bound hydrogenases have been found. The [NiFe] hydrogenases, when isolated, are found to catalyse both H2 evolution and uptake, with low-potential multihaem cytochromes such as cytochrome c3 acting as either electron donors or acceptors, depending on their oxidation state. Generally speaking, however, [NiFe] hydrogenases are more active in oxidizing H2. A wide spectrum of H2 affinities have also been observed in H2-oxidizing hydrogenases. Like [FeFe] hydrogenases, [NiFe] hydrogenases are known to be usually deactivated by molecular oxygen (O2). Hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha, and several other so-called Knallgas- bacteria, were found to be oxygen-tolerant. The soluble [NiFe] hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha H16 be conveniently produced on heterotrophic growth media. This finding increased hope that hydrogenases can be used in photosynthetic production of molecular hydrogen via splitting water. = [FeFe] hydrogenase = Crystal structure of [FeFe] hydrogenase The hydrogenases containing a di-iron center with a bridging dithiolate cofactor are called [FeFe] hydrogenases. Three families of [FeFe] hydrogenases are recognized: * cytoplasmic, soluble, monomeric hydrogenases, found in strict anaerobes such as Clostridium pasteurianum and Megasphaera elsdenii. They catalyse both H2 evolution and uptake. * periplasmic, heterodimeric hydrogenases from Desulfovibrio spp., which can be purified aerobically. * soluble, monomeric hydrogenases, found in chloroplasts of green alga Scenedesmus obliquus, catalyses H2 evolution. The [Fe2S2] ferredoxin functions as natural electron donor linking the enzyme to the photosynthetic electron transport chain. In contrast to [NiFe] hydrogenases, [FeFe] hydrogenases are generally more active in production of molecular hydrogen. Turnover frequency (TOF) in the order of 10,000 s‚àí1 have been reported in literature for [FeFe] hydrogenases from Clostridium pasteurianum. This has led to intense research focusing on use of [FeFe] hydrogenase for sustainable production of H2. The active site of the diiron hydrogenase is known as the H-cluster. The H-cluster consists of a [4Fe4S] cubane shaped structure, coupled to the low valent diiron co-factor by a cysteine derived thiol. The diiron co-factor includes two iron atoms, connected by a bridging aza-dithiolate ligand (-SCH2-NH-CH2S-, adt), the iron atoms are coordinated by carbonyl and cyanide ligands. [FeFe]-hydrogenases can be separated into four distinct phylogenetic groups A‚àíD. Group A consists of prototypical and bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenases. In nature, prototypical [FeFe]-hydrogenases perform hydrogen turnover using ferredoxin as a redox partner while bifurcating types perform the same reaction using both ferredoxin and NAD(H) as electron donor or acceptor. In order to conserve energy, anaerobic bacteria use electron bifurcation where exergonic and endergonic redox reactions are coupled to circumvent thermodynamic barriers. Group A comprises the best characterized and catalytically most active enzymes such as the [FeFe]-hydrogenase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrHydA1), Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (DdHydAB or DdH), and Clostridium pasteurianum and Clostridium acetobutylicum (CpHydA1 and CaHydA1, referred to as CpI and CaI). No representative examples of Group B has been characterized yet but it is phylogenetically distinct even when it shares similar amino acid motifs around the H-cluster as Group A [FeFe]-hydrogenases. Group C has been classified as ‚Äúsensory‚Äù based on the presence of a Per-Arnt-Sim domain. One example of a Group C [FeFe]-hydrogenase is from Thermotoga maritima (TmHydS) which shows only modest catalytic rates compared to Group A enzymes and an apparent high sensitivity toward hydrogen (H2). A closely related subclass from Group D has a similar location on the bacterial gene and share similar domain structure to a subclass from Group E but it lacks the PAS domain. = [Fe]-only hydrogenase = Crystal structure of [Fe] hydrogenase 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin hydrogenase (EC 1.12.98.2) found in methanogenic Archaea contains neither nickel nor iron- sulfur clusters but an iron-containing cofactor that was recently characterized by X-ray diffraction. Unlike the other two types, [Fe]-only hydrogenases are found only in some hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea. They also feature a fundamentally different enzymatic mechanism in terms of redox partners and how electrons are delivered to the active site. In [NiFe] and [FeFe] hydrogenases, electrons travel through a series of metallorganic clusters that comprise a long distance; the active site structures remain unchanged during the whole process. In [Fe]-only hydrogenases, however, electrons are directly delivered to the active site via a short distance. Methenyl-H4MPT+, a cofactor, directly accepts the hydride from H2 in the process. [Fe]-only hydrogenase is also known as H2-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin (methylene-H4MPT) dehydrogenase, because its function is the reversible reduction of methenyl-H4MPT+ to methylene-H4MPT. The hydrogenation of a methenyl-H4MPT+ occurs instead of H2 oxidation/production, which is the case for the other two types of hydrogenases. While the exact mechanism of the catalysis is still under study, recent finding suggests that molecular hydrogen is first heterolytically cleaved by Fe(II), followed by transfer of hydride to the carbocation of the acceptor.  Mechanism  The molecular mechanism by which protons are converted into hydrogen molecules within hydrogenases is still under extensive study. One popular approach employs mutagenesis to elucidate roles of amino acids and/or ligands in different steps of catalysis such as intramolecular transport of substrates. For instance, Cornish et al. conducted mutagenesis studies and found out that four amino acids located along the putative channel connecting the active site and protein surface are critical to enzymatic function of [FeFe] hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (CpI). On the other hand, one can also rely on computational analysis and simulations. Nilsson Lill and Siegbahn have recently taken this approach in investigating the mechanism by which [NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze H2 cleavage. The two approaches are complementary and can benefit one another. In fact, Cao and Hall combined both approaches in developing the model that describes how hydrogen molecules are oxidized or produced within the active site of [FeFe] hydrogenases. While more research and experimental data are required to complete our understanding of the mechanism, these findings have allowed scientists to apply the knowledge in, e.g., building artificial catalysts mimicking active sites of hydrogenases.  Biological function  Assuming that the Earth's atmosphere was initially rich in hydrogen, scientists hypothesize that hydrogenases were evolved to generate energy from/as molecular H2. Accordingly, hydrogenases can either help microorganisms to proliferate under such conditions, or to set up ecosystems empowered by H2. Microbial communities driven by molecular hydrogen have, in fact, been found in deep-sea settings where other sources of energy from photosynthesis are not available. Based on these grounds, the primary role of hydrogenases are believed to be energy generation, and this can be sufficient to sustain an ecosystem. Recent studies have revealed other biological functions of hydrogenases. To begin with, bidirectional hydrogenases can also act as \\"valves\\" to control excess reducing equivalents, especially in photosynthetic microorganisms. Such a role makes hydrogenases play a vital role in anaerobic metabolism. Moreover, hydrogenases may also be involved in membrane-linked energy conservation through the generation of a transmembrane protonmotive force.[15]There is a possibility that hydrogenases have been responsible for bioremediation of chlorinated compounds. Hydrogenases proficient in H2 uptake can help heavy metal contaminants to be recovered in intoxicated forms. These uptake hydrogenases have been recently discovered in pathogenic bacteria and parasites and are believed to be involved in their virulence.[15]  Applications  Hydrogenases were first discovered in the 1930s,Thauer, R. K., \\"Biochemistry of methanogenesis: a tribute to Marjory Stephenson\\", Microbiology, 1998, 144, 2377-2406. and they have since attracted interest from many researchers including inorganic chemists who have synthesized a variety of hydrogenase mimics. The soluble [NiFe] hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha H16 is a promising candidate enzyme for H2-based biofuel application as it favours H2 oxidation and is relatively oxygen-tolerant. It can be produced on heterotrophic growth media and purified via anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography matrices. Understanding the catalytic mechanism of hydrogenase might help scientists design clean biological energy sources, such as algae, that produce hydrogen. = Biological hydrogen production = Various systems are capable of splitting water into O2 and H+ from incident sunlight. Likewise, numerous catalysts, either chemical or biological, can reduce the produced H+ into H2. Different catalysts require unequal overpotential for this reduction reaction to take place. Hydrogenases are attractive since they require a relatively low overpotential. In fact, its catalytic activity is more effective than platinum, which is the best known catalyst for H2 evolution reaction. Among three different types of hydrogenases, [FeFe] hydrogenases is considered as a strong candidate for an integral part of the solar H2 production system since they offer an additional advantage of high TOF (over 9000 s‚àí1)[6]. Low overpotential and high catalytic activity of [FeFe] hydrogenases are accompanied by high O2 sensitivity. It is necessary to engineer them O2-tolerant for use in solar H2 production since O2 is a by-product of water splitting reaction. Past research efforts by various groups around the world have focused on understanding the mechanisms involved in O2-inactivation of hydrogenases. For instance, Stripp et al. relied on protein film electrochemistry and discovered that O2 first converts into a reactive species at the active site of [FeFe] hydrogenases, and then damages its [4Fe-4S] domain. Cohen et al. investigated how oxygen can reach the active site that is buried inside the protein body by molecular dynamics simulation approach; their results indicate that O2 diffuses through mainly two pathways that are formed by enlargement of and interconnection between cavities during dynamic motion. These works, in combination with other reports, suggest that inactivation is governed by two phenomena: diffusion of O2 to the active site, and destructive modification of the active site. Despite these findings, research is still under progress for engineering oxygen tolerance in hydrogenases. While researchers have found oxygen-tolerant [NiFe] hydrogenases, they are only efficient in hydrogen uptake and not production[21]. Bingham et al.‚Äôs recent success in engineering [FeFe] hydrogenase from clostridium pasteurianum was also limited to retained activity (during exposure to oxygen) for H2 consumption, only. = Hydrogenase-based biofuel cells = Typical enzymatic biofuel cells involve the usage of enzymes as electrocatalysts at either both cathode and anode or at one electrode. In hydrogenase-based biofuel cells, hydrogenase enzymes are present at the anode for H2 oxidation.  Principle  The bidirectional or reversible reaction catalyzed by hydrogenase allows for the capture and storage of renewable energy as fuel with use on demand. This can be demonstrated through the chemical storage of electricity obtained from a renewable source (e.g. solar, wind, hydrothermal) as H2 during periods of low energy demands. When energy is desired, H2 can be oxidized to produce electricity.  Advantages  This is one solution to the challenge in the development of technologies for the capture and storage of renewable energy as fuel with use on demand. The generation of electricity from H2 is comparable with the similar functionality of Platinum catalysts minus the catalyst poisoning, and thus is very efficient. In the case of H2/O2 fuel cells, where the product is water, there is no production of greenhouse gases.

The film stars Eddie Murphy as Marcus Graham, a hotshot advertising executive who also happens to be an insatiable womanizer and male chauvinist. When he meets his new boss, Jacqueline Broyer (Robin Givens), Marcus discovers that she is essentially a female version of himself, and realizes he is receiving the same treatment that he delivers to others. The film also features Halle Berry, David Alan Grier, Martin Lawrence, Grace Jones, and Chris Rock. Murphy assisted in developing the story with writers Barry W. Blaustein and David Sheffield, having worked with the writing duo since his days on Saturday Night Live. Murphy hired Hudlin to direct Boomerang, following the latter's success with his debut film House Party (1990). Hudlin and the writers aimed to create a romantic comedy that differed strongly from Murphy's previous comic efforts. Filming took place mainly in New York City, while other scenes were filmed in Washington, D.C The film was released in the United States on July 1, 1992 and was the 18th highest-grossing film in North America that year. Boomerang earned over $131 million worldwide during its theatrical run. The film garnered nominations at the BMI Film & TV Awards and the MTV Movie Awards, while its soundtrack became a top-selling album. Entertainment Weekly called it an underrated classic and one of the best Eddie Murphy movies of the 1990s. A 2019 television series based on the film, also called Boomerang, premiered on February 12, 2019 on BET. Plot Advertising executive Marcus Graham is a serial womanizer, prone to lying to seduce women but unwilling to commit until he finds the \\"perfect woman.\\" His friends Tyler and Gerard tell him his standards are too high, particularly his habit of judging women by their feet. Marcus's company is acquired by cosmetics mogul Lady Eloise, who invites him to her home with amorous intentions; he spends the night with her, believing he will be promoted. The next day, he meets Jacqueline Boyer, who has been made head of his department instead. At a party to celebrate the merger, eccentric fashion diva Strang√© is announced as the new face of the company, and Jacqueline introduces Marcus to colleague Angela Lewis, whom he sets up with Gerard. Though they get along fine, Angela and Gerard learn that they're better as friends. Despite his best efforts, Marcus is unable to woo Jacqueline. Over dinner at his apartment, she ignores his advances and is more interested in the basketball game on TV, leaving him frustrated. On a business trip to New Orleans, Jacqueline unexpectedly invites Marcus into her room, and they have sex. Afterward, he is relieved to find her feet up to his standards. Marcus begins to fall for Jacqueline, but finds himself on the receiving end of his usual tactics: she ignores his feelings, manipulates him with sex, and keeps their relationship strictly on her terms. Discovering she has bragged about their trysts to Strang√©, whose advances he is forced to reject, Marcus confronts Jacqueline, and she ends their affair. Marcus finds himself the subject of office gossip, and his work begins to suffer. After a major business proposal is almost ruined, Jacqueline forces Marcus to take a few paid weeks off as an alternative to being fired. He spends time with Angela, who tries to bring him out of his funk. After hosting Thanksgiving dinner with Tyler, Gerard, and Gerard's tactless parents, Marcus and Angela sleep together. Gerard is furious, believing Marcus will mistreat Angela like his past conquests. Marcus and Angela move in together, but she is hurt when he downplays their relationship in a phone call with Jacqueline. Marcus, having regained his confidence, proves newly attractive to Jacqueline, and they sleep together again. He returns home to Angela in the middle of the night, and when she confronts him in the morning, he explains that he is confused by his feelings for her and for Jacqueline. Angela breaks up with him and takes a promotion at another company. Marcus rebounds with Jacqueline, but realizes his love for Angela; he returns home to find she has moved out. Marcus reconciles with Gerard, and visits Angela at her new job, convincing her that he is truly committed to her, and they get back together. Cast Production =Development= Eddie Murphy created the original idea for the film, which he took to writers Barry Blaustein and David Sheffield, both of whom he had been working with during his days at Saturday Night Live. After they finished the first draft of the script and were given the greenlight on the project, Murphy offered the directing job to Reginald Hudlin, who had previously found critical and commercial success with his debut film House Party. For Boomerang, Hudlin said that, from a creative standpoint, he really wanted to take Murphy \\"somewhere where he's never been before,\\" and that he and the writers' goal was to \\"put Eddie through paces. To have him have an arc like most characters in movies do, where he's not just the Br'er Rabbit character starting trouble,\\" and to put him in a situation that \\"allows him to have a genuine obstacle.\\" Woody Omens, the cinematographer of the film, was insisted upon by Murphy, who had previously worked with him on Harlem Nights. Earl Watson worked as the film's main editor, and had previously worked with Hudlin on House Party. Francine Jamison-Tanchuck worked as the film's costume designer. The intention was to give Murphy's character Marcus Graham a cool, yet sophisticated style. \\"So typically when it comes to black characters, either you have to be a successful, smart business person, or you're hip, but you're never both,\\" said Hudlin. \\"And one of the reasons why the movie has had such enduring popularity is because the character is both. He's much more in the Cary Grant mode of business person.\\" While working on the characterization of the main character, Hudlin came up with the foot gag, which was used as a plot device to show the arc of the character's growth. It originated from a joke between the director and his friends about a man who's so picky about women that he even looks at their back teeth. \\"So it's like, how do we define that Eddie's a back teeth kind of guy? So I came upon the idea of showing feet. That no matter how beautiful this woman is, if she has messed up feet, he's out of there.\\" Also, Hudlin said that \\"we know he's evolved into a higher level of consciousness when he doesn't even notice what Halle Berry's feet look like.\\" The character Angela's art class was an idea the filmmakers had to put Murphy in a context where he could interact with kids, which he hadn't done prior to this film. The cast rehearsed for two weeks before production started, which the director said \\"really created that sense of team, and everyone playing off each other and everyone having that comfort level.\\" Murphy even told Hudlin that he hadn't rehearsed since his days at SNL, and that he was going to rehearse for all of his movies from then on. The scene in which Marcus changes his mind while with Jacqueline was a major rewrite to the script. According to Hudlin, in the original draft, Eddie's character Marcus =Casting= Halle Berry was cast as Angela. Hudlin knew immediately that he wanted Halle Berry for the role of Angela after she came in and did the reading, and was nervous that Murphy wouldn't like her. Berry had appeared in a couple of films prior to being cast in Boomerang. However, after Berry performed her screen test, Murphy told Hudlin \\"well, that's it. There's no need to see the other two actresses because she's the part.\\" Executives at Paramount Pictures were nervous about Robin Givens being cast in such a major role in the film, as she was disliked by many in the general public at the time because of her past relationship with Mike Tyson. Hudlin however, \\"thought that actually made her perfect for the role, that she was this formidable person, and a match for Eddie Murphy, who also had an intrepid reputation as a ladies' man. So, I wanted the audience to feel like this would be a fair fight.\\" David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence were cast as Murphy's best friends in the film. At the time, Grier was well known for the show In Living Color. About him, Hudlin said, \\"I think he is an absolutely underrated genius. I think he is Steve Martin-level funny, and it's too bad more people don't know how to use his comic gift, because he is absolutely brilliant.\\" Lawrence was brought on to the project after first working with Hudlin on House Party, which was his first major role in a film. Bebe Drake-Massey and John Witherspoon had played a couple in House Party, and were reunited for the film, this time playing the character Gerard's parents. Tisha Campbell also worked with Hudlin on House Party, and was brought on board to play Murphy's obnoxious, and somewhat obsessive, neighbor. While on the set, Hudlin would always rave about Campbell and Lawrence, and Murphy suggested Hudlin do a film with the two of them. Lawrence, who was developing his television show at the time, overheard the two actors talking, and decided to cast Campbell as his girlfriend and later wife, Gina, for his hit sitcom Martin. Grace Jones was cast in a role that was essentially written as a parody of herself. Of her work ethic, Hudlin said that \\"she was always 100% committed, and would do the absolute craziest thing at any given time. She was absolutely perfect for the role. It was written for her, and she came in very humble, very sweet.\\" Eartha Kitt was the hardest person to cast for the film, as she was somewhat offended by her character's tone in the original script. Eventually she accepted the role, after some of the more tasteless jokes in the script were changed or removed. Hudlin however did say that \\"she was great to work with,\\" and that \\"she really got into the spirit of it, and was a lot of fun.\\" Lela Rochon, who was known for her role in Murphy's 1989 film Harlem Nights, was brought back for a small role in Boomerang. Chris Rock, who was a protege of Murphy's, and had acted in small roles in a few other films at the time, was also given a bit part. The role of Lady Eloise's butler was played by Jonathan Hicks, a friend of the director's, who replaced a sick actor at the last minute. Hicks was a reporter for The New York Times, not an actor, and took the role as a favor to Hudlin. Three of the actors in this film have starred in the James Bond 007 films. This includes Geoffrey Holder (Baron Samedi from the film Live and Let Die), Grace Jones (May Day from the film A View to a Kill), and Halle Berry (Giacinta \\"Jinx\\" Johnson from the film Die Another Day). =Filming= Director Reginald Hudlin The majority of the film was shot in New York City during the winter. Although it was very cold, the director said that it was still \\"great to actually be in the city and get that authentic New York flavor.\\" Most of the film was done on location as well. Interior scenes which took place at Marcus' workplace were shot in the old Univision building that had been repainted for production. The scene in Lady Eloise's bedroom was shot at the Boston Park Plaza, in a suite personally redesigned by Ivana Trump, which accounts for the unique styling. The scene of Strang√©'s introduction was filmed at the Winter Garden Atrium of Brookfield Place. Although director Hudlin was willing to let his actors improvise, there were boundaries and rules to it, so that the jokes wouldn't lead to nowhere. He explained that once the actors \\"get a sense that someone will tell them if something doesn't work, or that we're getting too far afield, then they feel comfortable doing what they do. So, that's the balance that we struck.\\" Production went well, and as expected with so many comic actors and personalities around, was lively. During production, Hudlin said that whenever David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence worked, the film's crew usually worked a little slower because wherever they were, there would be so much comedy being generated and they were so funny that everyone wanted to hang out near where they were throughout the day. In the scene where the new fragrance is being presented to Strang√©, the director said that \\"what Grace was doing on the set while we were shooting was so funny that I remember Halle crying off camera, cause she was trying to keep a straight face but she couldn't. So whenever she was off-camera, she would just be literally crying because she was laughing so hard. And fortunately, for her reaction shots she was able to recover.\\" An extra scene, involving Jones taking off her chain-metal dress which is ringing off the metal detectors and walking through them naked, was shot in Newark Airport. However, the filmmakers felt it to be too shocking, to the point where it threw the rhythm of the picture off, so they only used it in the small clip being edited for the perfume commercial. The scene late in the film where Grier, Lawrence, and Murphy hug in front of the Empire State Building was shot around one or two o'clock in the morning, when the lights are usually shut off. If the filmmakers had them shut off at their command, it would have cost them $40,000‚Äì$60,000, so instead Hudlin had the three hug, and the lights were eventually shut off as usual. When editing the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if the lights were being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching the kids at the school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version. Near the production's end, some scenes that still needed to be shot were done in Washington, D.C., where Murphy was also shooting The Distinguished Gentleman. Originally, some of the film was to take place in the Caribbean, and scenes were to be shot there. However, the setting was changed to New Orleans, and the scenes taking place there were shot in D.C. =Music= Marcus Miller produced the original score for the film, while Antonio \\"L. A.\\" Reid and Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds worked on the soundtrack. With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said The soundtrack album reached the number four spot on the Billboard 200, and number one on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It included multiple singles that charted in their own right, the most successful of which was Boyz II Men's \\"End of the Road\\", which went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, and stayed there for thirteen weeks, breaking Elvis Presley's previous record of eleven weeks with his version of \\"Hound Dog\\". =Design= The production was very demanding, including an expensive wardrobe budget, which Hudlin felt was completely worth the price. \\"The clothing in the movie is incredible, for both the men and the women. Eddie looks great, Robin and Halle look great. Great hair, great makeup work for all concerned, cause we wanted it to look fantastic. We wanted to give people a level of production value they hadn't seen for Eddie's first foray into true romantic comedy.\\" =Influences= Fran√ßois Truffaut's Jules and Jim was an influence on the story arc between the characters Angela, Gerard and Marcus. Director Hudlin explained, \\"I remember when I saw Jules and Jim when I was a kid, and that awkward, awkward feeling of two guys, one has a better time with girls than the other, and they both fall in love with the same woman. And I remember the agony of watching the emotional stakes of that picture. And, this is just a fun movie, not trying to compare myself to Truffaut on any level, but, at least, that's what inspired the moment.\\" The pacing and rhythm of Howard Hawks' His Girl Friday was a big influence on the pictures style. Woody Allen's Annie Hall was also very influential while Hudlin worked on the project because, according to Hudlin, \\"if you talk about contemporary romantic comedy, you're really talking about Annie Hall.\\" Reception =Box office= On its opening weekend, the film earned $13,640,706, and ranked number three at the box office. It also ranked number three the two following weekends. By the end of its theatrical run, the film had grossed over $70 million domestically, and $61 million outside of the U.S., making a total of $131,052,444. It was the 18th highest- grossing film in the US in 1992. Compared to its budget, the film was considered a success. =Critical reception= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 43%, based on 35 reviews, and an average rating of 4.93/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Boomerang injects some fresh color into the corporate rom-com formula, but the frothy fun is undercut by off-putting gender dynamics and misjudged gags.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A- on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert gave the film and its stars positive reviews, calling the movie \\"predictable but enjoyable all the same.\\" In 2005, the film was ranked number 21 on BET's Top 25 Movies In the Last 25 Years list. In retrospect, Kristen Baldwin from Entertainment Weekly said: \\"Though it never received the critical appreciation it deserved, and it is often overlooked in discussions of the rom-com pantheon today, Boomerang still holds up 27 years later.\\"https://ew.com/movies/2019/02/11/boomerang-eddie-murphy-halle-berry/ About the critical response, Hudlin said: = Awards and nominations = * 1993 BMI Film & TV Awards  Most Performed Song from a Film: Antonio \\"L.A.\\" Reid, Daryl Simmons, and Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds for End of the Road (winner) * 1993 MTV Movie Awards  Best Breakthrough Performance: Halle Berry (nominated)  Best Comedic Performance: Eddie Murphy (nominated)  Best Movie Song: Boyz II Men, End of the Road (nominated)  Most Desirable Female: Halle Berry (nominated) See also * Eddie Murphy filmography References External links    Category:1992 films Category:1992 comedy films Category:1992 romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American sex comedy films Category:English- language films Category:African-American films Category:Films about advertising Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.

The district serves all of Caddo Parish. Its founding superintendent was Clifton Ellis Byrd, a Virginia native, who assumed the chief administrative position in 1907 and continued until his death in 1926. C.E. Byrd High School, which was established in 1925 and is located on Line Avenue in Shreveport, bears his name. In 1965, the board was sued by E. Edward Jones and his wife, Leslie, to compel, successfully, the desegregation of Caddo Parish public schools. Jones, a former Caddo Parish educator, was a pastor and civil rights figure in Shreveport, who from 1986 to 2003 was the president of the National Baptist Convention of America, Inc. A former Caddo Parish school superintendent, Walter C. Lee of Shreveport, was a long-term member of the elected Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. In 1970, the first three Republicans of the 20th century were elected to the Caddo Parish School Board, Joel B. Brown, E. L. \\"Ed\\" McGuire, and Billy Guin, later the last of the Shreveport municipal utility commissioners. Among those elected with Brown, McGuire, and Guin was Pike Hall, Jr., a Shreveport attorney who later served on the state appeal court and the Louisiana Supreme Court.

No new offences were created by the statute. It is one of the earliest English statutes still in force, although it has been very significantly amended.The Treason Act 1351 legislation.gov.ukArchbold 2013, para. 25-1 It was extended to Ireland in 1495Poynings' Law (10 Hen.7 c.22) and to Scotland in 1708. The Act was passed at Westminster in the Hilary term of 1351, in the 25th year of the reign of Edward III and was entitled \\"A Declaration which Offences shall be adjudged Treason\\". It was passed to clarify precisely what was treason, as the definition under common law had been expanded rapidly by the courts until its scope was controversially wide. The Act was last used to prosecute William Joyce in 1945 for collaborating with Germany in World War II. The Act is still in force in the United Kingdom. It is also still in force in some former British colonies, including New South Wales.The Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), section 16 Like other laws of the time, it was written in Norman French. The Act is the origin of the definition of treason in the United States (in Article III of the Constitution). Joseph Story wrote in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States that: Origin Until 1351 treason was defined by the common law. The king's judges gradually expanded the scope of treason under the pretext that any \\"assortment of royal power,\\" by which was meant doing anything which only the king (or his officers) could legally do, was considered treason ‚Äì even hunting deer in the king's forests. When a John Gerberge of Royston was convicted of treason for falsely imprisoning someone who owed him ¬£90, the barons compelled Edward III to agree to an Act of Parliament to restrict the definition of treason to definite limits. Joseph Story wrote: \\"This statute has ever since remained the pole star of English jurisprudence upon this subject.\\" Content The Act distinguished two varieties of treason: high treason and petty treason (or petit treason), the first being disloyalty to the Sovereign, and the second being disloyalty to a subject. The practical distinction was the consequence of being convicted: for a high treason, the penalty was death by hanging, drawing and quartering (for a man) or drawing and burning (for a woman), and the traitor's property would escheat to the Crown; in the case of a petty treason the penalty was drawing and hanging without quartering, or burning without drawing; and property escheated only to the traitor's immediate lord. The forfeiture provisions were repealed by the Forfeiture Act 1870, and the penalty was reduced to life imprisonment by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. A person was guilty of high treason under the Act if they: *\\"compassed or imagined\\" (i.e. planned; the original Norman French was \\"fait compasser ou ymaginer\\") the death of the king, his wife or his eldest son and heir (following the coming into force of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 on 26 March 2015, this has effect as if the reference were to the eldest child and heir); *violated the king's companion, the king's eldest daughter if she was unmarried or the wife of the king's eldest son and heir (following the coming into force of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, this has effect as if the reference were to the eldest son only if he is also the heir); *levied war against the king in his realm; *adhered to the king's enemies in his realm, giving them aid and comfort in his realm or elsewhere; *counterfeited the Great Seal or the Privy Seal (repealed and re-enacted in the Forgery Act 1830; death penalty abolished in 1832;Forgery, Abolition of Punishment of Death Act 1832 (2 & 3 Will 4 c 123) reduced to felony in 1861 (except in Scotland)); *counterfeited English coinage or imported counterfeit English coinage (reduced to felony in 1832Coinage Offences Act 1832 (2 & 3 Will 4 c 34)); *killed the Chancellor, Treasurer (this office is now in commission), one of the king's justices (either of the King's Bench or the Common Pleas), a justice in eyre, an assize judge, and \\"all other Justices\\", while they are performing their offices. (This did not include the barons of the Exchequer.) The penalty for counterfeiting coins was the same as for petty treason.1 Hale 219-220 The offence had previously been called petty treason, before the Act elevated it to high treason.Commentaries on the Laws of England, William Blackstone, Book 4 chapter 6 Under the Act petty treason was the murder of one's lawful superior: that is if a servant killed his master or his master's wife, a wife killed her husband or a clergyman killed his prelate. This offence was abolished in 1828. The Act originally envisaged that further forms of treason would arise that would not be covered by the Act, so it legislated for this possibility. The words from \\"Et si per cas\\" onwards have been translated as: The Act in Scotland Following the union of England and Scotland by the Acts of Union 1707, Scotland continued to have its own treason laws until the Treason Act 1708 abolished Scottish treason law and extended English treason law to Scotland. This Act also made it treason to counterfeit the Great Seal of Scotland,Section 12 and to kill the Scottish Lords of Session and Lords of JusticiarySection 11 (in addition to forging the British ‚Äì formerly English ‚Äì seal, and killing English judges). However while in England and Ireland forgery of the seal of Great Britain ceased to be treason under the Forgery Act 1861, this Act did not apply to Scotland. Also, forging the Scottish seal is still treason in Scotland,Treason Act 1708, section 12 but has not been treason in England or Ireland since 1861.Forgery Act 1861 The 1351 Act still applies in Scotland today, and is a reserved matter which the Scottish Parliament has no power to modify. Interpretation Although the first kind of treason is described as \\"compassing,\\" the offence does not consist of purely thinking. A subsequent clause which requires that an \\"overt act\\" must also be proven has been held by judges to apply to all kinds of treason. Adhering to \\"enemies\\" does not include adhering to rebels or pirates. During the trial of Roger Casement, who in 1916 was accused of collaborating with Germany during World War I, the defence argued that the Act applied only to activities carried out on British soil, while Casement had committed the acts of collaboration outside Britain. However, closer reading of the originally unpunctuated medieval document allowed for a broader interpretation, leading to the accusation by his supporters that Casement was \\"hanged by a comma\\". The court decided that a comma should be read in the text, crucially widening the sense so that \\"in the realm or elsewhere\\" meant where acts were done and not just where the \\"King's enemies\\" might be. Repeals The clauses about forgery and counterfeiting were repealed in 1830 and 1832. The words from \\"Et si per cas\\" onwards were repealed by the Criminal Law Act 1967 and the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967.

Background and education Webster was the second son of Thomas Webster QC. He was educated at King's College School and Charterhouse, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was well known as an athlete in his earlier years, having represented his university in the first Inter-Varsity steeplechase and as a runner. As such, the Cambridge University Alverstone Club is named in his honour, and makes a pilgrimage to Alverstone, Isle of Wight, every 4 years. His interest in cricket and foot- racing was maintained in later life. He refereed races for the early Amateur Athletic Club and set rules for long jump and shot put. He was President of Surrey County Cricket Club from 1895 until his death, and of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1903. Legal, judicial and political career Webster in the 1890s Webster was called to the bar in 1868, and became QC only ten years afterwards. His practice was chiefly in commercial, railway and patent cases until (June 1885) he was appointed Attorney-General in the Conservative Government in the exceptional circumstances of never having been Solicitor- general, and not at the time occupying a seat in parliament. He was elected for Launceston in the following month, and in November exchanged this seat for the Isle of Wight, which he continued to represent until his elevation to the House of Lords. Except under the brief Gladstone administration of 1886, and the Gladstone-Rosebery cabinet of 1892‚Äì1895, Sir Richard Webster was Attorney- General from 1885 to 1900. In 1890 he was leading counsel for The Times in the Parnell inquiry; in 1893 he represented Great Britain in the Bering Sea arbitration; in 1898 he discharged the same function in the matter of the boundary between British Guiana and Venezuela. In the House of Commons, and outside it, his political career was prominently associated with church work; and his speeches were distinguished for gravity and earnestness. In July 1885, he was made a Knight Bachelor. In December 1893, he was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Knight Grand Cross. In January 1900 he was created a Baronet, but in May the same year succeeded Sir Nathaniel Lindley as Master of the Rolls, being raised to the peerage as Baron Alverstone, of Alverstone in the County of Southampton and sworn of the Privy Council, and in October of the same year he was elevated to the office of Lord Chief Justice upon the death of Lord Russell of Killowen. He presided over some notable trials of the era including Hawley Harvey Crippen. Although popular, he was not considered an outstanding judge; one colleague wrote after his death that \\"the reports will be searched in vain for judgments of his that are valuable\\". He received the honorary degree Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the University of Edinburgh in April 1902, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society later the same year. In late 1902 he was in South Africa as part of a commission looking into the use of martial law sentences during the Second Boer War. In 1903 during the Alaska boundary dispute he was one of the members of the Boundary Commission. Against the wishes of the Canadians it was his swing vote that settled the matter, roughly splitting the disputed territory. As a result, he became extremely unpopular in Canada. He retired in 1913, and was created Viscount Alverstone, of Alverstone, Isle of Wight in the County of Southampton. Personal life Vanity Fair, 1913 Webster married in 1872 Louisa Mary Calthrop, daughter of William Charles Calthrop. She died in March 1877. They had one son and one daughter. Their only son, the Honourable Arthur Harold Webster (1874‚Äì1902) died childless in August 1902, aged 28, after an operation for appendicitis. The Arthur Webster Hospital, opened in 1905, was presented to the town of Shanklin, Isle of Wight by Lord Alverstone in memory of his son. The building is still in use as the Arthur Webster Clinic. He commissioned the architect Edward Blakeway I'Anson to build Winterfold House near Cranleigh in the Surrey Hills in 1886, in a classic late Victorian style, and laid out grounds with flowering trees and shrubs. Lord Alverstone died at Cranleigh, Surrey, in December 1915, aged 72 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery under a Celtic cross. His peerages became extinct on his death.

These started in November 1930 and ended in December 1932. They were conducted as per the recommendation of Jinnah to Viceroy Lord Irwin and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, and by the report submitted by the Simon Commission in May 1930. Demands for Swaraj, or self-rule, in India had been growing increasingly strong. B. R. Ambedkar, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, K. T. Paul and Mirabehn are key participants from India. By the 1930s, many British politicians believed that India needed to move towards dominion status. However, there were significant disagreements between the Indian and the British political parties that the Conferences would not resolve. The key topic was about constitution and India which was mainly discussed in that conference. There were three Round Table Conferences from 1930 to 1932. First Round Table Conference (November 1930 ‚Äì January 1931) The Round Table Conference officially inaugurated by His Majesty George V on November 12, 1930 in Royal Gallery House of Lords at London and chaired by the Prime Minister. Ramsay MacDonald was also chairman of a subcommittee on minority representation, while for the duration his son, Malcolm MacDonald, performed liaison tasks with Lord Sankey's constitutional committee.Ramsay Macdonald, The Awakening of India (1909) advocated progress towards Indian self-government. One of the foremost advisers was Sir Malcolm Hailey, an Indian civil servant with thirty years experience. The leading Liberal on the committee, Lord Reading was \\"well aware of the troubles which might arise if an when India became independent.\\"MacDonald Papers file 112/1/67, C Sanger, Malcolm MacDonald: End of Empire (1995), p.79. Clement Attlee, who served on the Simon Commission, wanted an early resolution but was baulked by the Conservatives in government until 1945. Sir Samuel Hoare wrote the cabinet a memo recommending a federal formula for the Government of India to \\"make it possible to give a semblance of responsible government and yet retain the realities and verities of British control.\\"12 December 1930, Carl Bridge, Holding India to the Empire: the British Conservative Party and the 1935 Constitution (new Delhi: Sterling, 1988). Hoare was in direct correspondence with Viceroy Lord Irwin and Sir Malcolm Hailey, Governor of United Provinces, where Gandhi lived. The idea was proposed by the princely states and other Liberal Indian leaders including Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru would welcome it. The minority Labour government hoped to win the support of Liberal and Conservative colleagues in parliament for a \\"responsive\\" Indian government at central and provincial levels and a conservative legislature. The eight British political parties were represented by sixteen delegates. There were fifty-eight political leaders from British India and sixteen delegates from the princely states. In total 74 delegates from India attended the Conference. However, the Indian National Congress, along with Indian business leaders, kept away from the conference. Many of them were in jail for their participation in Civil Disobedience Movement. Lord Irwin made a controversial statement declaring that India should be eventually granted Dominionship. After a discussion in Delhi in December 1929, Gandhi had refused to attend the London meetings. In accordance with the law the Viceroy arrested Gandhi sending him to prison. However the Mahatma's presence would prove vital for the conference success. The culmination of events were settled by the Gandhi‚ÄìIrwin Pact (1931). A chastised Gandhi wanted the peaceful end to civil disobedience demanded by the Viceroy and his Council. Lord Irwin was triumphant but the Simon Commission had failed to gauge the determination of Indian opinion to ultimately bring independence.Christopher Lee (2018), Viceroys: the creation of the British(London: Constable) The Conservatives were disgusted: \\"the whole conference was manipulated and manoeuvred by the Socialist Party, said Churchill, \\"to achieve the result they had set before themselves from the beginning, namely the conferring of responsible government at the centre upon Indians.\\"Speech March 1931, Constitutional Club, W S Churchill =Participants= * British Representatives:  Labour: Ramsay MacDonald, Lord Sankey, Wedgwood Benn, Arthur Henderson, J.

These were followed by discussions on the reports of the sub-committees on Federal Structure, Provincial Constitution, Minorities, Burma, North West Frontier Province, Franchise, Defense services and Sindh. These were followed by 2 more plenary meetings and a final concluding session. It was difficult for progress to be made in the absence of the Indian National Congress but some advances were made. The Prime Minister wrote his diary \\"India has not considered. It was communalism and proportions of reserved seats\\" that exposed the worst side of Indian politics.15 December 1930, Macdonald Diary; David Marquand, Ramsay MacDonald (London: Jonathan Cape, 1977) The idea of an All- India Federation was moved to the centre of discussion by Tej Bahadur Sapru. All the groups attending the conference supported this concept. The princely states agreed to the proposed federation provided that their internal sovereignty was guaranteed. The Muslim League also supported the federation as it had always been opposed to a strong Centre. The British agreed that representative government should be introduced on provincial level.Second round tableconf Second Round Table Conference (September 1931 ‚Äì December 1931) The Congress, which had killed and boycotted the first conference, was requested to come to a settlement by Sapru, M. R. Jayakar and V. S. Srinivasa Sastri. A settlement between Mahatma Gandhi and Viceroy Lord Irwin not true the Congress to the second session of Round Table Conference, which opened on 7 September. Although MacDonald was still Prime Minister of Britain, he was by this time heading a coalition Government (the \\"National Government\\") with a Conservative majority, including Sir Samuel Hoare as a new Secretary of State for India. On 7 November 1931 Gandhi secretly met with Malcolm MacDonald in his rooms at Balliol College, Oxford. He took the opportunity to gain publicity from a tour of the East End and visit to Lancashire cotton mills, but could not persuade the government to grant self-rule: of more urgency was the gathering Agrarian Crisis and Congress newest campaign for a Fair rent. The discussion led to the passing of the Government of India Act 1935, yet the Governor of United Provinces was happy to be rid of Gandhi's campaigns \\"playing havoc with six or seven million tenants in the UP.\\"Robert D Pearce, The Turning Point in Africa: British Colonial Policy 1938-1948 (London: Cass, 1982), p.43. When Nehru decried that the famine relief programme was pitiful, he was already asking for a kisan rent strike, and Patel called for a satyagraha. When quizzed in London about his intentions for the conference, Gandhi averred he could do nothing about agrarian problems from England. Little was achieved other than the Government realised they had to tackle absentee landlordism in India to avert disaster. =Participants= * British Representatives:  Labour: Ramsay MacDonald, Wedgwood Benn, Arthur Henderson, William Jowitt, Hastings Lees-Smith, F.

By the second: The Second Round Table Conference (September 7, 1931) * Congress Representation ‚Äî The Gandhi-Irwin Pact opened the way for Congress participation in this conference. Gandhi was invited from India and attended as the sole official Congress representative accompanied by Sarojini Naidu and also Madan Mohan Malaviya, Ghanshyam Das Birla, Muhammad Iqbal, Sir Mirza Ismail (Diwan of Mysore), S.K. Dutta and Sir Syed Ali Imam. Gandhi claimed that the Congress alone represented political India; that the Untouchables were Hindus and should not be treated as a ‚Äúminority‚Äù; and that there should be no separate electorates or special safeguards for Muslims or other minorities. These claims were rejected by the other Indian participants. According to this pact, Gandhi was asked to call off the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and if he did so the prisoners of the British government would be freed except the criminal prisoners, i.e. those who had killed British officials. He returned to India, disappointed with the results and empty- handed. * National Government ‚Äî two weeks earlier the Labour government in London had fallen. Ramsay MacDonald now headed a National Government dominated by the Conservative Party. * Financial Crisis ‚Äì During the conference, Britain went off the Gold Standard further distracting the National Government. At the end of the conference Ramsay MacDonald undertook to produce a Communal Award for minority representation, with the provision that any free agreement between the parties could be substituted for his award. Gandhi took particular exception to the treatment of untouchables as a minority separate from the rest of the Hindu community. Other important discussions were the responsibility of the executive to the legislature and a separate electorate for the Untouchables as demanded by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.\\"mr Gandhi demanded that as one of the conditions for his accepting their fourteen points, they should oppose the claims of the Depressed Classes, and the smaller minorities.\\" Dr.Ambedkar letter to The Times of India, 12 October 1931. Gandhi announced that henceforth he would work only on behalf of the Harijans: he reached a compromise with the leader of depressed classes, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, over this issue; the two eventually resolved the situation with the Poona Pact of 1932.Collected Writings of Mahatma Gandhi, 51.; Robin J.Moore, The Crisis of Indian Unity 1917-1940, p.289. But not before the conference of All-India Depressed Classes had specifically 'denounced the claim made by Gandhi.'C.Keer, Dr Ambedkar: Life and Mission, (1971) p.178-9. Third Round Table Conference (November ‚Äì December 1932) The third and last session assembled on November 17, 1932. Only forty-six delegates attended since most of the main political figures of India were not present. The Labour Party from Britain and the Indian National Congress refused to attend. From September 1931 until March 1933, under the supervision of the Secretary of State for India, Sir Samuel Hoare, the proposed reforms took the form reflected in the Government of India Act 1935. =Participants= * Indian States' Representatives: Akbar Hydari (Dewan of Hyderabad), Mirza Ismail (Dewan of Mysore), V.

The company was founded in 1823 by Jonas Chickering and James Stewart, but the partnership dissolved four years later. By 1830 Jonas Chickering became partners with John Mackay, manufacturing pianos as \\"Chickering & Company\\", and later \\"Chickering & Mackays\\" until the senior Mackay's death in 1841, and reorganized as \\"Chickering & Sons\\" in 1853. Chickering pianos continued to be made until 1983. History Jonas Chickering, founder. It was P.T. Barnum who persuaded Jenny Lind - the Swedish Nightingale - to make a concert tour of the United States. After her agreement, Barnum commissioned the Chickering company to manufacture a custom grand piano for her nationwide tour, ultimately involving 93 performances. The piano was completed by August 1850; Lind arrived in September and the concert series began in Boston. Her pianist was Otto Goldschmidt, whom she married at the end of her tour. Coincidentally, as the tour began, Henry E. Steinway (Steinweg) and his large family arrived in New York as immigrants from Germany. Henry attended the opening night of the NYC concert series but showed little interest in the diva. His profound interest was in the Chickering piano, to which he dashed for such careful examination that he nearly had to be hauled away so the concert could begin. On December 1, 1852, a fire destroyed Chickering's piano factory located at 336 Washington Street in Boston. One policeman was killed. The walls of the building collapsed, and set adjoining structures on fire. A new factory was built in 1853-54 at 791 Tremont Street in Boston. From 1860-1868 space in the building was the location of the Spencer Repeating Rifle Company, who made over 100,000 rifles and carbines for the U.S. Army and sportsmen from 1862-1868.Marcot, Roy A. \\"Spencer Repeating Firearms\\" 1995. This structure still stands today. It was renovated into artist studios in 1972.Chickering Piano Works Fire at CelebrateBoston.com Jonas Chickering made several major contributions to the development of piano technology, most notably by introducing a one-piece, cast-iron plate to support the greater string tension of larger grand pianos. He also invented a new deflection of the strings, and in 1845 the first convenient method for over stringing in square pianos. Instead of setting the strings side by side, the company introduced substituting an arrangement of the string in two banks, one over the other. This not only saved space but brought the powerful bass strings directly over the most resonant part of the sound-board, a principle used to this day in the construction of all pianos, both grands and uprights. Chickering was the largest piano manufacturer in the United States in the middle of the 19th century, but was surpassed in the 1860s by Steinway. In 1867, Jonas's son Frank Chickering had the Imperial Cross of the Legion of Honour, then one of the world's most prestigious non- military awards, bestowed upon him by Emperor Napoleon III for services to the art of music, one of more than 200 awards the piano manufacturer garnered over the years. The company became in 1908 part of the American Piano Company (Ampico),Grove's dictionary of music and musicians. NY: 1920 and continued after the merger in 1932 of American with the Aeolian Company, to form Aeolian-American. That company went out of business in 1985, and the Chickering name continued to be applied to new pianos produced by Wurlitzer and then the Baldwin Piano Company.

J. Casson, (May 17, 1898 ‚Äì February 20, 1992) was a member of the Canadian group of artists known as the Group of Seven. He joined the group in 1926 at the invitation of Franklin Carmichael. Casson is best known for his depictions of landscapes, forests and farms of southern Ontario, and for being the youngest member of the Group of Seven. Life and career Casson was born in 1898 in Toronto, Ontario, to an English Quaker father, John Edwin Casson, and a Canadian mother, Henrietta (Hardy).http://184.150.237.247/file/COM/9661_MeadowvaleBook_PartTwo.pdf At age nine, he moved to Guelph, and to Hamilton at age fourteen. The first exposure he had to art was at Hamilton Technical School, where he was asked by his teacher to demonstrate for the class. His father sent him to work at age 15 as an apprentice at a Hamilton lithography company. In 1915 the family moved back to Toronto. At the same time as working, he attended evening classes at Central Technical School. The first public exhibition of his work was at the Canadian National Exhibition, in 1917. He was hired by the commercial art/ engravers firm Brigden's, owned by George and Fredrick Brigden (brothers). In 1919 Casson moved to Rous and Mann where he was influenced by and assistant to Group of Seven member Franklin Carmichael to sketch and paint on his own. Carmichael and Casson then moved on to the first Canadian silkscreen printing firm, Sampson, Matthews Ltd, founded by artist J. E. SampsonProfile of artist Joseph Ernest Sampson (1887‚Äì1946); The Sampson-Matthews Print Collection. Retrieved June 4, 2016. and businessman C. A. G. Matthews.Robert Stacey. Graphic Art and Design. The Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved June 4, 2016. Carmichael introduced Casson to The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto, where he met many well-known artists, including other Group of Seven members. During the 1920s, Casson continued to paint during his spare time alone and with the Group of Seven. Alfred enjoyed watercolour and in 1925 along with Carmichael and F. H. Brigden (Fredrick), founded the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour. After Frank Johnston, a Group of Seven member, left the group in 1921, Casson seemed like an appropriate replacement. Later in 1926, he was invited by Carmichael to become member of the Group of Seven. In the same year he also became an associate member of the conservative Royal Canadian Academy. He and Carmichael left Rous and Mann Ltd. in 1926 to join Sampson Matthews . After Carmichael left in 1932 to teach at the Ontario College of Art, Casson became their Art Director and later their vice-president in 1946. In 1952, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Corresponding member. In 1924 Casson married Margaret Petry. His father died shortly after his marriage, and he had to take care of and support his widowed mother. After the ending of the Group of Seven in 1932, he helped found the Canadian Group of Painters in 1933. Several members of the Group of Seven became members of the Canadian Group of Painters including Lawren Harris, Arthur Lismer, A. Y. Jackson, and Franklin Carmichael. Casson developed a painting style with clear colours and background designs. He \\"retired\\" in 1957 at age 60, to paint full- time. A. J. Casson died in 1992, just three months short of his 94th birthday, and is buried on the grounds of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, along with six other Group of Seven members. Works Casson's Give Us the Tools and We Will Finish the Job ‚Äì Help Finish the Job ‚Äì Buy Victory Bonds, 1941 A privately owned work of A. J. Casson's appeared on the May 26, 2008, airing of PBS's \\"Antiques Roadshow.\\" According to the owner, the painting was given to her grandfather by Casson, his friend and neighbor at the time. The work appraised in the $25,000 to $35,000 range. In 1954 he was one of eighteen Canadian artists commissioned by the Canadian Pacific Railway to paint a mural for the interior of one of the new Park cars entering service on the new Canadian transcontinental train. Each mural depicted a different national or provincial park; Casson's was Algonquin Provincial Park. A large oil on canvas by the Group of Seven's A. J. Casson, Street in Glen Williams, sold for a record $542,800, including buyer's premium on June 1, 2010. The Casson ‚Äì a leafy, autumnal portrait of Glen Williams, a small town near Toronto ‚Äì carried a pre-sale estimate of $200,000‚Äì$250,000, the highest such valuation ever accorded a Casson canvas. Canadian art critic and historian Paul Duval wrote in 1980, \\"Street in Glen Williams is unquestionably his key autumn portrayal.\\" Bidding for Street in Glen Williams began at $180,000, then bounded in increments of $10,000, then $20,000 before reaching its hammer price of $460,000. The clinching bid came from a western Canadian buyer. The previous record for a Casson, $489,100, including premium, was also set by Joyner, in May 2005. On Wednesday, November 23rd, 2016, A.J. Casson's Gathering Storm sold for $1,534,000 CDN (premium included).

From 1936 to 1948, he represented the CIO and member unions in landmark collective bargaining deals with major corporations including General Motors and U.S. Steel. According to journalist Murray Kempton, anti-communists referred to him as \\"Comrade Big.\\" Marion Dickerman and Ruth Taylor (eds.), Who's Who In Labor: The Authorized Biographies of the Men and Women Who Lead Labor in the United States and Canada and of Those Who Deal with Labor. New York: The Dryden Press, 1946; pg.286. Background Lower East Side Historic District, New York City. Pressman was born Leon Pressman on July 1, 1906, on the Lower East Side of in New York City, first of two sons of immigrants Harry and Clara Pressman of Minsk. His father was a milliner on the Lower East Side of New York City. As a child, Leon survived polio. In his teens, the family moved out to the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. In 1922, he entered Washington Square College (absorbed into New York University), where classmates included Nathan Witt and possibly Charles Kramer (later, fellow AAA and Ware Group members), then transferred to Cornell University, where he studied under labor economist Sumner Slichter. Alger Hiss circa 1948 In 1926, Pressman received his bachelor's degree from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. In 1929, he received a law degree from Harvard Law School. At Harvard, he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and was in the same class as Alger Hiss. With future defending lawyer Edward Cochrane McLean, they served on the Harvard Law Review: > Mr. Hiss: ... Lee Pressman was in my class at the Harvard Law School, and we > were both on the Harvard Law Review at the same time. Career After graduation, he joined the law firm of Chadbourne, Stanchfield & Levy (currently Chadbourne & Parke) in New York City. (During the Great Depression, founder Thomas Chadbourne asserted that the capitalist system itself was \\"on trial\\" and became an early champion of both collective bargaining rights and profit sharing for workers. ) There, he worked for Jerome Frank (future chair of the SEC). When Jerome left in 1933 to work in FDR's New Deal, Pressman joined a small firm called Liebman, Blumenthal & Levy, to handle Jerome's clients. =New Deal service 1933‚Äì1936= AAA efforts In 1933, Pressman joined the Ware Group at the invitation of Harold Ware, a Communist agricultural journalist in Washington, DC: \\"I was asked to join by a man named Harold Ware\\" (See \\"Ware Group\\" sub-section, below) AAA In July 1933, Pressman received appointment as assistant general counsel of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) by Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace. He reported to Jerome Frank, who was general counsel. The New Dealers saw the AAA as complementing the National Recovery Act (NRA ‚Äì where fellow Ware Group member and lifelong Hiss friend Henry Collins worked). As they arrived at AA, two camps quickly arose: previously existing officials who favored agribusiness interests and New Deal appointees who sought to protect small farmers (and farm laborers) and consumers as much as agribusiness. Or, as Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. summarized the attitude, \\"There were too many Ivy League men, too many intellectuals, too many radicals, too many Jews.\\" By December 1933, Frank had hired John Abt and Arthur (or Howard) Bachrach (brother of Abt's sister Marion Abt Bachrach) to develop litigation strategies for agricultural reform policies. In February 1935, Chester Davis fired many of Frank's cadre, including Pressman, Frank, Gardner Jackson, and two others. WPA, RA By April 1935, Pressman had been appointed general counsel in the Works Progress Administration by Harry L. Hopkins. A joint resolution dated January 21, 1935, called the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, passed in the United States Congress and became law on April 8, 1935. As a result, on May 6, 1935, FDR issued Executive Order 7034, that essentially transformed the Federal Emergency Relief Administration into the Works Progress Administration. \\"Pressman set to work analyzing the budget request that would transform FERA into the WPA.\\" By mid- summer 1935, Rexford G. Tugwell appointed him general counsel of the Resettlement Administration. Pressman split his time between the two agencies. However, by year's end (he recollected in a letter to Tugwell in 1937), he came to believe that New Deals changes occurred only when \\"major controlling financial interests\\" concurred or when \\"financial interests had been able to seize effective control of the code and manipulate it to enhance their power.\\" =CIO 1936‚Äì1948= Pressman left government service in the winter of 1935-36 and went into private law practice in New York City with David Scribner as Pressman & Scribner. Clients included the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association (MEBA), the United Public Workers CIO, and other unions. In 1943, during hearings by a Dies Committee \\"Special Committee on Un-American Activities,\\" director of research J.B. Matthews asked whether witness Lucien Koch had retained the New York City law firm of \\"Hays, St. John, Abramson, and Schulman\\" and \\"Is this Lee Pressman's firm?\\"; Koch confirmed \\"yes.\\" (Osmond K. Fraenkel, a fellow member of the National Lawyers Guild, was also a member of Hays, St. John, Abramson, and Schulman. ) In his role as the CIO's general counsel, Pressman was influential in helping to stop the attempt to deport Communist Longshoreman's Union official Harry Bridges. He continued to interact with Bridges well into June 1948, as longshoremen continued to threaten strikes on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and Bridges remained president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Under John L. Lewis 1936‚Äì1940 In June 1936, he was named a counsel of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO‚Äîlater AFL-CIO) for the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC‚Äîlater, the United Steelworkers of America), appointed by union chief John L. Lewis as part of a conscious attempt to mobilize left-wing activists on behalf of the new labor federation. According to scholars, \\"One of Pressman's unofficial roles in the CIO was liaison between the CIO's Communist faction and its predominantly non-Communist leadership.\\" In 1936-1937, he supported the Great Flint Sit-Down Strike. In 1937, Michigan Governor William Francis Murphy supported workers rights and the nascent United Auto Workers in a sit-down strike at General Motors plants. He listened to advice Pressman that civil rights statues passed to protect African- American voters during the Civil War might grant the federal government authority to intervene in strikes in terms of Free Speech, like strikes in Harlan County, Kentucky. In February 1939, when President Roosevelt made Murphy United States Attorney General, Murphy created a Civil Liberties Unit within the criminal division of the United States Department of Justice. In June 1938, Pressman moved back to Washington, DC, to become full-time general counsel for the CIO and the SWOC.Hearings Regarding Communism in the United States Government ‚Äî Part 2, pg. 2849. He remained in this position for the next decade. (According to his obituary in the New York Times, he was general counsel from 1936 to 1948.) In August 1938, Pressman criticized the American Bar Association in The CIO News in his own \\"bill of particulars,\\" which included the following: # Mooney Case: ABA refused to investigate injustice committed therein # Industrial Espionage: ABA lawyers have worked with firms \\"that engage in industrial espionage\\" # Sacco-Vanzetti Case: ABA refused to investigate # Wagner Act: Shared ABA and NLG members declared this act \\"unconstitutional\\" # Racism: ABA membership asked for and often excluded members based on race (\\"White,\\" \\"Indian,\\" \\"Negro,\\" \\"Mongolian\\") In May 1939, Pressman spoke on behalf of the CIO before the US Senate's Education and Labor sub-committee to support the \\"National Health Bill\\" (part of the Reorganization Act of 1939), sponsored by US Senator Robert F. Wagner. He attacked the American Medical Society's position against the bill as \\"reactionary,\\" which he felt had kept the bill from going \\"far enough.\\" From May through August 1939, Pressman attacked support for the \\"Walsh amendments\\" to the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (AKA the \\"Wagner Act\\"). In May 1939, when AFL president William Green supported the amendments on CBS Radio, the CIO's response, penned by Pressman, accused Green of colluding with the National Association of Manufacturers against not just the CIO but also the AFL, i.e., workers. In August 1939, Pressman appeared before the Senate Labor Committee to state that Green's support did not represent AFL rank and file. Also in August 1939, Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939, which restricted political campaign activities by federal employees. A provision of the Hatch Act made it illegal for the federal government to employ anyone who advocated the overthrow of the federal government.Goldstein, Political Repression in Modern America: From 1870 to 1976, 2001, p. 244. The left-leaning United Public Workers of America (UFWA) immediately hired Pressman to challenge the constitutionality of the Hatch Act.Gall, Pursuing Justice: Lee Pressman, the New Deal, and the CIO, 1999, p. 216. In October 1939, during a closed-door session during a CIO convention, president John L. Lewis declared his intent to rid the CIO of \\"Communist influence.\\" This decision came in response particularly from Philip Murray and Sidney Hillman, the CIO's two vice presidents, that pre-dated the Hitler-Stalin Pact (announced the previous month). Instead, Lewis would empower eight member of the CIO's 42 executive committee members. Further, Lewis increased the number of CIO vice presidents from two to six with: R. J. Thomas, president of the United Automobile Workers; Emil Rieve, president of the Textile Workers of America; W. J. Dalrymple, president of the United Rubber Workers; and Reid Robinson, president of the Smelter Workers. \\"Left forces\\" failed to have Joseph Curran, president of the National Maritime Union, elected vice president. Further, Lewis demoted Harry Bridges from West Coast CIO director to California state CIO director. The New York Times further stated: On January 3, 1940, Pressman discussed the \\"1940 Legislative Program of the CIO\\" on CBS Radio. orIn his speech, Pressman said: > On pretexts of economy, more money for war purposes and similar catch cries, > the reactionary financial interests and their political henchmen hope to > reduce appropriations for the unemployed and for publish works, to > emasculate labor and social legislation, and to restrict our civil > liberties. The CIO ... calls for a determined advance in adapting social > legislation to the needs of the whole American people. Under Philip Murray 1940‚Äì1948 Philip Murray, CIO president {1940-1952) On January 14, 1940, John L. Lewis retired from the CIO presidency, and Philip Murray succeeded him. On May 18, 1940, Pressman again spoke on CBS Radio, this time on the \\"Wagner Act.\\" In 1941, FDR appointed CIO vice president Sidney Hill to the Office of Production Management. Hillman lobbied for a mediating entity to OPM, and FDR created the National Defense Mediation Board (NDMB). In June 1941, NMDB and the United Auto Workers took over a North American Aviation factory during a strike. Later in June 1941, at a convention of the National Lawyers Guild in Chicago, Pressman criticized the Vinson and Ball bills before the US Congress, both of which he accused of a \\"long-range\\" plan whose aims included \\"destruction of workers' rights to organize, bargain collectively, and strike\\"; \\"destruction of labor organizations as the barrier to unchecked monopoly profits\\"; and \\"complete control of the national economy and the government by big business.\\" Pressman continued to give as good as he got. In February 1940, he held a \\"heated exchange\\" with US Representative Clare Hatch during a hearing of the US House Labor Committee, again on the issue of amendments to the NRLA (Wagner Act): In September 1941, Pressman received a pin from pro-Communist Mike Quill, leader of the Transport Workers Union (TWU), a CIO member, during a TWU strike. Pressman then urged TWU strikers to stand up to the New York City government, as he had four years earlier in 1937 when the TWU first left the AFL for the CIO. In July 1942, the National War Labor Board sought advice on FDR's wage stabilization policy by increasing wages in the four \\"Little Steel\\" companies with a combined 157,000 employees by one dollar. CIO president Philip Murray and Pressman both supported the increase. In July 1943, the CIO formed a political action committee, the \\"CIO-PAC,\\" chaired by Sidney Hillman, and supported by Pressman and John Abt as co-counsels. In his 1999 memoir, Abt, general counsel for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America under Sidney Hillman, claimed the leaders of the Communist Party of the USA had inspired the idea of the CIO- PAC: > In 1943, Gene Dennis came to me and Lee Pressman to first raise the idea of > a political action committee to organize labor support for Roosevelt in the > approaching 1944 election. Pressman approached Murray with the idea, as I > did with Hillman. Both men seized upon the proposal with great enthusiasm. Thus, in 1943, as American spy Elizabeth Bentley resurrected the Ware Group (of which Abt had been a member), could not risk involvement with her or the group. Instead, the group reformed under Victor Perlo as the Perlo Group. In September 1943 at a conference of the National Lawyers Guild, Pressman praised labor for reducing strikes and promoting the war effort. He praised the National War Labor Board's policy for recognizing labor unions as institutions within the basic framework of our democratic society. He criticized \\"selfish blocs\\" in Congress that had opposed FDR's program. In 1944, Pressman participated in resolution of a labor dispute of a national case in basic steel, involving some six hundreds unions on strike. The six-person board consisted of David L. Cole and Nathan P. Feisinger for the government, Philip Murry of the CIO with Pressman as counsel for unions, John Stevens with Chester McLain of U.S. Steel for industry. During 1945‚Äì1947, Pressman worked with John Abt for the CIO to help create the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) as successor to the International Federation of Trade Unions, itself seen as dominated by communist and socialist parties. During formation of the WFTU and in working with pro-Soviet American unions, \\"the active role played by\\" Pressman \\"in writing and rewriting convention resolutions helped to smooth possible conflicts.\\" In April 1945, Pressman represented Harry Bridges before the U.S. Supreme Court in Bridges v. Wixon with the help of Carol Weiss King and her recruit, Nathan Greene who penned the brief. Later that month, Pressman joined Murray, Abt, and other CIO officials in Paris for a meeting with Soviet counterparts about the WFTU. In October 1945, he traveled to Moscow with a CIO delegation in the company of John Abt among others. On June 6, 1946, he contributed to a broadcast entitled \\"Should There Be Stricter Regulation of Labor Unions?\\" on America's Town Meeting of the Air show on NBC Radio with Sen. Allen J. Ellender, Henry J. Taylor, and Rep. Andrew J. Biemiller. In July 1946, at a National Lawyers Guild convention in Cleveland, he attacked the \\"fallacious notion that increased wages in the interests of adequate purchasing power necessarily bring higher prices.\\" He also attacked future Progressive Party vice presidential candidate, US Senator Glen H. Taylor, for the latter's prediction of economic uncertainty due to monopolies. He asked that an \\"aroused and enlightened public\\" make itself heard in Congress and in the 1946 fall elections: > This Congress has sought to stifle labor organization and at the same time > has fought vigorously to assure expanded profit levels through tax and price > policies. It has resisted any effort to lighten the tax burden on the lower > income groups, but has acted swiftly to remove the excess-profits tax on > corporations while continuing the carry-back provisions permitting gigantic > tax rebates out of excess-profits tax payments of prior years. US Senator Robert A. Taft, official portrait In 1947, Pressman became involved in passage of the Taft-Hartley Act. In January 1947, he appeared on \\"New York Times radio\\" station WQXR-FM with US Senator Carl A. Hatch, former National War Labor Board chairman William Hammatt Davis, and General Precision Equipment Corporation general counsel Robert T. Rinear, to debate the topic \\"Do we need new labor laws?\\" While endorsing a Truman commission plan, he attacked any labor legislation passed hastily ahead of the commission's results, saying, \\"Judging from the bills now before Congress, their purpose is merely to penalize labor organizations.\\" Senator Hatch agreed with him that severe wage cuts in terms of real wages and increased cost of living would not find resolutions in terms of legislation that addresses only jurisdictional disputes or secondary boycotts. \\"We need additional and new laws on all phases of the general problem of labor-management,\\" Hatch said. Again in January 1947, on the topic of the related Portal to Portal Act of 1947, publicly before the US Senate Judiciary Committee, he urged Congress to make that act a simple authorization to employers and unions to settle portal claims through collective bargaining, while prohibiting management from attempting such settlements with individual workers at the \\"economic mercy\\" of employers. Further, he urged Congress to use the US Supreme Court's definition of \\"work\\" as activities of an employe which required physical or mental exertion for an employer's benefit and under an employer's control. Any legislation that ended portal-to-portal claims, he said, would \\"most seriously undermine\\" and in fact threatened \\"the entire future, operation\\" of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act. Again at month's end, he attacked labor curb bills in Congress during a speech before the University of Cincinnati Lawyers Institute. He said: > Where parties agree to union security, what objection can there be? Nine > million workers are now covered by such contracts. The status of the union > under the Wagner Act established the obligation not to discriminate against > non-members.

He also asserted that labor unions do not constitute monopolies, compared with industrial combines. In June 1947, Pressman also wrote an influential critique of the Taft-Hartley Act, used by President Harry S. Truman as background material to justify his \\"bristling\\" veto of the measure. Co-sponsor, US Senator Robert A. Taft belittled Truman's veto: \\"The veto message covers the Pressman memorandum which the Senator from Montana (James E. Murray) put in the record and to which I replied. The veto message substantially in detail follows the Pressman memorandum ... point by point.\\" Taft's accusation drew considerable attention for days. On July 4, the Washington Post's Drew Pearson noted \\"There've been considerable charges and counter-charges that CIO Counsel Lee Pressman ghost-wrote the hot White House veto message on the Taft-Hartley labor bill. Truth is that he had no direct hand in writing the message, though some of his words did creep in.\\" Pearson explained that White House Assistant Clark Clifford had penned the veto with help from William S. Tyson, solicitor of the US Labor Department, and Paul Herzog, chairman of the National Labor Relations Board ‚Äì and their \\"analyses\\" of the bill bore striking resemblance to Pressman's analysis.\\" Later on June 24, 1947, Pressman appeared again on CBS Radio with Raymond Smethurst, general counsel of NAM to discuss the effect of the new labor law. In August 1947, he gave a strong speech to the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (IUMMSW) against the Taft-Hartley Act. In August 1947, Pressman and Reid Robinson called for a third party to support Henry A. Wallace for U.S. President during a convention of the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (\\"a Communist-dominated union\\"). By September, the right wing of the CIO, led by Emil Rieve, claimed they were about to drive left wingers \\"with Lee Pressman as the leading victim\\" out of the CIO during its Fall 1947 convention. In late 1947, Meyer Bernstein of the United Steel Workers of America wrote as an anti-communist against Pressman (amidst a rising tide led by Walter Reuther against pro-communists in the CIO). =1948= Walter Reuther (right) conferring with President Truman in the Oval Office (1952) As of 1948, James I. Loeb, co-founder of both the Union for Democratic Action (UDA) Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), stated that Pressman was \\"probably was the most important Communist in the country ... he certainly was a Communist influence.\\" In early 1948, Pressman led a group of like-minded colleagues in a pitch to CIO executives to abandon Truman and the Democratic Party for Henry A. Wallace and his Progressive Party. The pitch failed. Repercussions came quickly. In late 1947, housecleaning of the CIO from communists had already begun when Len De Caux was let go by Murray. Private practice On February 4, 1948, Pressman was \\"fired from his $19,000 job as CIO general counsel, reportedly as a byproduct of a factional struggle within the federation in which anti-Communist labor leader Walter Reuther emerged triumphant. Time magazine (anti-communist) gloated, \\"Lee Pressman and his Communist line are no longer popular in the C.I.O., where Walter Reuther's right wing is in ascendancy.\\" (On March 4, 1948, CIO president Philip Murray announced his replacement by Arthur J. Goldberg. ) Pressman went into private legal practice in New York City following his firing. In March and April 1948, however, it was clear that the CIO still used his services, even after \\"firing\\" him. In March 1948, he joined CIO attorneys in opposing Government attorneys, who had declared that \\"the Taft-Hartley Law's ban against expenditures by labor unions in connection with Federal elections permissibly limited Constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.\\" In April 1948, he represented the CIO before the Supreme Court in a case about barring of expenditures by labor unions for political purposes. (Felix Frankfurter, then Supreme Court Justice, taught at Harvard Law while Pressman was a student there.) In March 1948, Pressman's name appeared in the New York Times as legal counsel of the Furriers Joint Board. The thousand-member Associated Fur Coat and Trimming Manufacturers, Inc., had asked for a return to pre-WWII two-season wage scheme plus compliance with affidavits from non-communist union leaders per the Taft-Hartley Act. The latter condition put pressure on two CPUSA union leaders, Ben Gold and Irving Potash. \\"In a unique turn of events,\\" Pressman cited a Taft-Hartley Act provision to block a lockout. He sued for a temporary injunction based on failure by employers to give 60-day lockout notice to workers, plus failure to provide thirty-day notification to Federal and state mediation services. He also helped get Potash set free on $5,000 bail while awaiting deportation hearings. Pressman continued private practice. He continued to represent the MEBA, e.g., over a restraining order against strikes on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts in 1948. At the Supreme Court he represented Philip Murray (1886‚Äì1952), Scottish-born steelworker and American labor leader, first president of SWOC and USWA, and longest-serving president of the CIO. Also in March 1948, Pressman joined a group of lawyers in defending five \\"aliens\\" against deportation hearings due to their Communist ties. Pressman represented all five, at least some of whom had their own attorneys: alleged Soviet spy Gerhart Eisler (represented by Abraham J. Isserman), Irving Potash of the Fur and Leather Workers Union, Ferdinand C. Smith of the National Maritime Union (Pressman); Charles A. Doyle of the Gas, Coke and Chemical Workers Union (Isadore Englander), and CPUSA labor secretary John Williamson (Carol Weiss King). Pressman went on to join Joseph Forer, a Washington-based attorney, in representing the five before the U.S. Supreme Court. On May 5, 1948, Pressman and Forer received a preliminary injunction so their defendants might have hearings with examiners unconnected with the investigations and prosecutions by examiners of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. (All attorneys were members of the National Lawyers Guild.) On May 16, 1948, the United Public Workers read aloud their general counsel Pressman's letter, summarized by the New York Times: On May 19, 1948, Securities and Exchange Commission official Anthon H. Lund accused Pressman of interfering in a lawsuit filed against the Kaiser-Frazer car manufacturing company in a Federal District Court in New York City. He specified that between February 3 and 9, 1948, Harold J. Ruttenberg, vice president of the Portsmouth Steel Corporation, had contacted Pressman for advice on \\"how to go about filing a stockholder's suite against Kaiser-Frazer.\\" Later in May, during testimony before an SEC board of inquiry, Pressman declared he had \\"absolutely nothing to do with\\" the suit. \\"I have not been requested by anyone to suggest the name of a lawyer who would file a lawsuit against the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation.\\" He stated, \\"I demand that I be given the opportunity to examine Mr. Lund under oath on the stand to determine who gave him that inaccurate information.\\" The trial's examiner Milton P. Kroll informed Pressman, \\"You have been given the opportunity to state your position on the record. Your request is denied.\\" After passage of the Mundt-Nixon Bill on May 19, 1948, at month's end Pressman submitted a long, undated statement called \\"The Mundt Control Bill (H.R. 5852), a Law to Legalize Fascism and Destroy American Democracy\\" as part of proceedings by the Senate Judicial Committee on \\"Control of Subversive Activities.\\" During 1948, Pressman formed Pressman, Witt & Cammer; Bella Abzug started her career there. Since February 1948 or earlier, Witt's clients had included the Greater New York CIO Council. In September 1948, Pressman and Charles J. Margiotti tested the campaign-expenditures provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. Pressman and Margiotti each received $37,500 for their services ‚Äì a fee CIO President Philip Murray called \\"outrageous, even for Standard Oil.\\" Political plays Pressman was important enough in American politics to have Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. single him out as recent example in Schlesinger's concept of the Vital Center as first described in a long New York Times article in 1948 entitled \\"Not Left, Not Right, but a Vital Center.\\" In it, Schlesinger argues first that the 19th Century concept of \\"linear\\" spectrum Left and Right did not fit developments of the 20th Century. Rather, he promoted the \\"circular\\" spectrum of DeWitt Clinton Poole, in which Fascism and Nazism would meet at the circle's bottom with Soviet Communism (Leninism, Stalinism). He himself promotes the term \\"Non-Communist Left\\" (NCL) as an American modification of Leon Blum's Third Force. He cites as example the ascendancy of Walter Reuther in the CIO and ouster of Lee Pressman: > Newspapers will doubtless continue to refer to Walter Reuther as the leader > of the Right wing of the CIO, whereas, as every automobile manufacturer > knows, Reuther is to the Right only in the sense of being profoundly pro- > democratic and anti-Communist ... Instead of backing the Non-Communist Left > as the group in Europe closest to the American progressive faith in > combining freedom¬∑ and planning, the CIO, for example, maintained a > disturbing silence over foreign affairs; and altogether too many liberals > followed Communist cues in rejoicing at every Soviet triumph and at every > Socialist discomfiture. The Wallace Doctrine of non-interference with Soviet > expansion prevailed in these years. In recent months, the conception of the > non-Communist Left has made headway in the United States. On the moderate > Right, men like Senator Vandenberg and John Foster Dulles have recognized > its validity. The fight against Communist influence in the CIO, culminating > in Walter Reuther's victory in the United Auto Workers and the discharge of > Lee Pressman as CIO general counsel, has finally brought the CIO side by > side with the AFL in support of the Third Force in Europe. Schlesinger was carefully noting the entrance of Pressman into national politics. Progressive Citizens of America members, 1947. From left, seated, Henry A. Wallace, Elliott Roosevelt; standing, Dr. Harlow Shapley, Jo Davidson. Pressman became a close adviser of Progressive Party 1948 presidential candidate Henry A. Wallace. In fact, when his former AAA boss Rexford Tugwell joined the Progressive Party campaign in early 1948, \\"he did so on condition that Lee Pressman would serve as its secretary.\\" In March 1948, Pressman joined a 700-member national organization in support of Henry A. Wallace for U.S. president and Glen H. Taylor for U.S. vice president. By June 1948, the New York Times cited him as \\"general counsel\\" for the \\"National Labor Committee for Wallace.\\" At the party's convention (July 23‚Äì25, 1948), Pressman served on the committee (under Rexford Tugwell, who had helped create and directed the AAA back in the early 1930s) to create a platform that the New York Times summed up as \\"endorsing Red foreign policy.\\" At the time, the Washington Post dubbed Pressman, Abt, and Calvin Benham \\"Beanie\\" Baldwin (C. B. Baldwin) as \\"influential insiders\\" and \\"stage managers\\" in the Wallace campaign. However, he was reportedly \\"forced out because of his Communist line.\\" During the 1948 convention, the New York Times described as follows: > Lee Pressman, who, for years, exerted a powerful left-wing influence as > counsel for the CIO, is secretary of the Platform Committee, which will hold > another executive session at 10 A. M. Friday before preparing its final > draft for submission to the 2,500 delegates who are expected at the > convention's closing session next Sunday. American Labor Party logo On June 9, 1948, Pressman declared that he himself was running for public office as the candidate of the American Labor Party for U.S. Congress in the 14th District of New York (Brooklyn).Lawrence Kestenbaum (ed.), \\"Lee Pressman,\\" Political Graveyard.com Retrieved August 9, 2010. In early July 1948, he registered his candidacy. He ran against Abraham J. Multer. Multer used Pressman's communist association against him early on by claiming that he had received his \\"certificate of election\\" from the Daily Worker (CPUSA newspaper), thanks to its condemnation of him. In July 1948, he faced condemnation from New York state's CIO head Louis Hollander, who promised to oppose Pressman's candidacy. In late August 1948, he In August 1948, during the Progressive Party convention in Philadelphia, Rexford Tugwell, chairman of its platform committee found his self-style \\"old- fashioned American progressive\\" platform scrapped by a pro-Communist line platform spearheaded by Pressman. TIME magazine noted, \\"It now seemed obvious to Tugwell that the Communists had taken over.\\" In the Fall of 1948, Communist affiliation continued to hound Pressman's campaign. A month before the election, Pressman might have held out hope, as the New York Times characterized him as a lawyer of \\"wide reputation\\" and a man with a \\"national reputation\\" and did not mention allegations in Washington. Days before the election, headlines in the Brooklyn and New York area were still appearing, like this from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle: \\"Pressman: Candidate for Congress, Long Active in Pro-Red Groups.\\" =Private practice 1951-1969= Between 1948 and 1950, Pressman had represented \\"the estates of persons with heirs in Russia\\" of interest to the Soviets as well as affairs of AMTORG. By 1951, Pressman had only one major client left, the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association (MEBA). Its president, Herbert Daggett, retained Pressman at $10,000 (some $94,000 adjusted for 2017). Espionage allegations Whittaker Chambers (1948) =Ware Group (1933‚Äì1935)= In 1933, Pressman was one of the original members of the Ware Group. He was present at its earliest known meeting. Furthermore, surmised historian Allen Weinstein, as the \\"top-ranking AAA official in the Ware Group,\\" he was most likely also a top recruiter of new members. Weinstein also noted that, according to Gardner Jackson, Pressman had recommended that the Nye Committee take Alger Hiss on loan. In 1935, he left the group and Washington, DC. Of his time there, Ware Group controller J. Peters said of Pressman that he was a \\"big climber\\" and had a \\"bad case of 'big-shotitis'.\\" In 1936, when Pressman began work as general counsel for the CIO, Peters recommended against it, as Pressman was hard to control. However, Chambers encouraged him to take the position anyway. In 1936‚Äì1937, Chambers put Pressman in touch with Philip Rosenbliett and \\"Mack Moren\\" to travel to Mexico and buy arms for \\"J. Eckhart,\\" a representative of the Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, former underground Communist Whittaker Chambers privately identified Pressman to Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle as a member of a so-called \\"Ware group\\" of Communist government officials supplying information to the secret Soviet intelligence network. In the 1940s, the FBI investigated Pressman and other Communists. On October 31, 1943, during a CIO convention in Philadelphia, the FBI recorded conversations of Roy Hudson, then CPUSA labor secretary. Hudson met with CIO union leaders (including Harry Bridges). On November 5, they heard identified the voice of a man whom Hudson instructed on Party demands for changes in the CIO platform: the name was Lee Pressman. Pressman's meetings continued with Hudson into September 1944. Historian Robert H. Zieger held that Pressman was no longer a communist by the time he joined the CIO. Instead, he claimed that Pressman was important to the CIO because he \\"retained close ties with the CPUSA.\\" =1948 denial= On August 3, 1948, in testimony under subpoena before the House Committee on Un- American Activities (HUAC), Chambers identified Pressman as a member of the Ware group.Testimony of Whittaker Chambers , House Committee on Un-American Activities, Hearings Regarding Communist Espionage in the United States Government, August 3, 1948. On August 4, Pressman characterized Chambers' testimony as \\"smearing me with the stale and lurid mouthings of a Republican exhibitionist who was bought by Henry Luce.\\" By using Chambers, he claimed, HUAC sought to achieve three objectives: distract Americans from \\"the real issues\\" (civil rights, inflation, housing, Israel, and repeal of the Taft- Hartley Act), smear FDR's New Deal officials, and discredit Henry Wallace and his associates.\\" On August 20, 1948, in testimony under subpoena before the HUAC, Pressman declined to answer questions regarding Communist Party membership, citing grounds of potential self-incrimination. =1950 admission= Chairman Martin Dies, Jr. of HUAC proofs his letter replying to FDR's attack on his committee (1938) During the superheated political environment which surrounded the Korean War, Pressman seems to have stepped back from his previous communist affinities. In 1950, Pressman resigned from the American Labor Party because of \\"Communist control of that organization,\\" which was reported in the press and which signaled HUAC that Pressman was at last ready to talk.Hearings Regarding Communism in the United States Government ‚Äî Part 2, p. 2844. Called again before Congress to give testimony on Communist Party activities, on August 28, 1950, Pressman reversed his previous decision to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights and gave testimony against his former comrades. Pressman stated: > In my desire to see the destruction of Hitlerism and an improvement in > economic conditions here at home, I joined a Communist group in Washington, > D. C, about 1934. My participation in such group extended for about a year, > to the best of my recollection. I recall that about the latter part of 1935‚Äî > the precise date I cannot recall, but it is a matter of public record ‚Äî I > left the Government service and left Washington to reenter the private > practice of law in New York City. And at that time I discontinued any > further participation in the group from that date until the present. He stated that he had no information about the political views of his former law school classmate Alger Hiss and specifically denied that Hiss was a participant in this Washington group. He indicated that in at least one meeting of his group, perhaps two, he had met Soviet intelligence agent J. Peters.Hearings Regarding Communism in the United States Government ‚Äî Part 2, pp. 2855-2856. Although he made no mention of having himself conducted intelligence-gathering activities, his 1950 testimony provided the first corroboration of Chambers' allegation that a Washington, DC communist group around Ware existed, with federal officials Nathan Witt, John Abt and Charles Kramer named as members of this party cell. TIME magazine mocked Pressman in its reportage in the issue following his hearing: > Like many another smart young man who followed the Communist line, sharp- > eyed, sharply dressed Attorney Lee Pressman did very well for a long time. > Har-vardman Pressman launched his leftward-turning career in Henry Wallace's > AAA back in 1933, ended up as chief counsel of the CIO.

Personal and death On June 28, 1931, Pressman married the former Sophia Platnik. The couple had three daughters. He was a member of the International Juridical Association (IJA) (\\"probably through Shad Polier who was a classmate of mine at law school\\"), the National Lawyers Guild (NLG), and the New York Bar Association. According to biographer Gilbert J. Gall, Pressman, Witt, and others formed the \\"radical\\" wing of the NLG against a more moderate, liberal wing lead by NLG president Morris Ernst (also co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union). In 1957, he stated during an interview: > I don't think today's generation has nearly as exciting a life as we did > when we were in our twenties, but I suppose it's the times. It seems to me > that the labor movement with all the strength it has nowadays should be able > to organize several million unorganized workers. Pressman died at home at 26 Forster Avenue in Mt. Vernon, New York, on November 20, 1969. Sophia Platnik Pressman (Cornell '28) died on May 12, 1980, in Sandia Park, New Mexico. Legacy \\"Showing men in power how to get things done legally\\" was Pressman's special skill, asserts historian Gilbert J. Gall in a biography of Pressman. TIME magazine (never a friend of Pressman's) wrote at his death: > Died. Lee Pressman, 63, the C.I.O.'s legal counsel from 1936 until 1948, > when his far-left politics finally cost him his job and career; of cancer; > in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. Pressman never made any bones about his Communist > leanings, often supporting the Moscow line. Yet as a union lawyer he was > tops; he played a major role in negotiating the original C.I.O. contracts > with such industrial giants as U.S. Steel and General Motors, and ably > fought labor cases before the Supreme Court. In 1948, \\"the first of a series of reports on Communists and Pro-Communists for Wallace\\" summarized Pressman's role in both the CIO and the 1948 presidential campaign as follows: Subsequent findings KGB expert Alexander Vassiliev. Pressman's VENONA codename was \\"Vig.\\" In 1946, VENONA reveals that Pressman hosted Mikhail Vavilov, first secretary in the Soviet embassy, at his home in Washington, DC, where he met fellow (former) Ware Group member Charles Kramer. In 1948, Anatoly Gorsky, former chief of Soviet intelligence operations in the United States, listed Pressman, code-named \\"Vig‚ÄìLee Pressman, former legal adviser of the Congress of Industrial Organizations\\" among the Soviet sources likely to have been identified by US authorities, as a result of the defection of Soviet courier Elizabeth Bentley three years earlier. In 1949, VENONA reveals that the KGB used Pressman to pay Victor Perlo for \\"analysis.\\" In 1950, it reported \\"Vig‚Äìcovering the activities of the Progressive Party.\\" In 1951, Pressman served as \\"conduit\\" to pay funds to Harold Glasser. In 1951, VENONA reveals that Soviet intelligence in Washington reported to Moscow, \\"Vig has chosen to betray us.\\" Following the fall of the Soviet Union, archival information on Soviet espionage activity in America began to emerge. Working in Soviet intelligence archives in the middle 1990s, Russian journalist Alexander Vassiliev discovered that Pressman, codenamed \\"Vig,\\" had told only fragments of the truth to Congressional inquisitors in 1950. Working with historians John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, Vassiliev revealed that Pressman had actually remained \\"part of the KGB's support network\\" by providing legal aid and funneling financial support to exposed intelligence assets. As late as September 1949, Soviet intelligence had paid $250 through Pressman to Victor Perlo for an analysis of the American economic situation, followed by an additional $1000 in October. A 1951 Soviet intelligence report indicated that \\"Vig\\" had \\"chosen to betray us,\\" apparently a reference to his 1950 public statements and Congressional testimony. Historians Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev indicate that the assessment was an overstatement, however. With his carefully limited testimony before HUAC and in his unpublicized interviews with the Federal Bureau of Investigation it is instead charged that Pressman: > ... Sidestepped most of his knowledge of the early days of the Communist > underground in Washington and his own involvement with Soviet intelligence, > first with Chambers's GRU network in the 1930s and later with the KGB. He > had never been the classic 'spy' who stole documents.

He gambled that there > would not be anyone to contradict his evasions and that government > investigators would not be able to charge him with perjury. He won his bet > ...

It has the habit of a robust shrub with a spherical or bottle-shaped trunk. It has several cylindrical branches at the top. This plant is endemic to Madagascar, where it grows in open deciduous forest on Mesozoic calcareous rock and granite or gneiss on the western side of the island at low elevations. It is known in Madagascar as \\"Bontaka\\". It is also endemic from Befandriana Nord to Mandritsara. Constantin and Bois first described Pachypodium baronii as a species of the genus Pachypodium in 1907. Morphology =Habit= Pachypodium baronii is a robust, globose (spherical)- to bottle-shaped shrub in habit. Its trunk is subglobose, not quite globose or spherical, mostly narrowed at the base with dimensions of in length by by . At the top of the trunk, it abruptly narrows into one or several cylindrical branches that are to by by in diameter, tapering to to in diameter. Pachypodium baronii typically grows to high. Its bark is colored pale grey or grey-green and is smooth, but sometimes retains remnants of leaf scars. Branchlets are to in length by in width. They are covered with paired often curved spines that measure long to in diameter at the base of the branchlet. Its basal (lower) part of the branchlet is conical and laterally compressed at 0.33 to 0.66 times the spine's length. The spines are often red and pubescent, hairy when young, turning medium to dark brown and glabrous and smooth. = Leaves = The leaves of Pachypodium baronii are confined to the apices of the branchlets. The leaves are petiolate, meaning that they bear a stalk that attaches to the stem and to the leaf blade. The petiole is a pale reddish-green about long. It is pubescent, or hairy-like. The blade is coriaceous, leathery, and medium green. It has a midrib that is above pale green and shiny and beneath pale and glaucous, smooth without hairs. The pale green midrib and dark green reticulate venation is visible when the blade is fresh. When dried, the blade is papery, ovate to obovate or narrowly so, and 1.4 to 3 times as long as it is wide. Therefore, the leaf measures to in length by to h). It is acuminate, tapering gradually to a sharp point, to apiculate, ending abruptly with a sharp, flexible tip at the apex and wedged- shape or cuneate to rounded at the base. The leaf's margin is revolute, rolled backward from the tip or margins to the undersurface, glabrous to sparsely pubescent above. Beneath it is pubescent especially on midrib and secondary veins as well as the impressed of venation. As well, underneath the leaf, the midrib and secondary veins are very prominent. The secondary veins are in 15 to 30 pairs, straight, upcurved at the apex, and forming an angle of 45‚Äì90¬∞ with the costathe rib, ridge, or especially the mid-rib, for instance, of a leaf. The tertiary, or third level of venation is reticulate, netted or showing a net like structure or pattern. = Inflorescence = The inflorescence of Pachypodium baronii is pedunculate, having a main axis to flower stalk. The inflorescence is congested, measures 16 cm (inch) by 40 (inch) in length by 40 cm (1.58-inch) to 4.5 cm (1.77-inch) to 12 cm (0.47-inch), and have 3 to 17 flowers. The inflorescence's peduncle, the stalk of an inflorescence or a stalk bearing a solitary flower in a one-flowered inflorescence, is pale green and terete, cylindrical but usually slightly tapering at both ends. It measures 7 mm (0.276-inch) to 20 mm (0.787-inch) in length by 4 mm (0.157-inch) to 6 mm (0.236-inch). The peduncle, as well, is glabrescent. The pedicels are pale reddish-green, 8 mm (0.315-inch) to long, and sparsely pubescent and hairy. The bracts\` of P. baronii are oblong and 2 to 3.5 times as long as wide, thus 5 mm (0.197-inch) to 11 mm (0.433-inch) in length by 2 mm (.078-inch) to 2.5 mm (0.098-inch). The bracts are longer than the sepals and are pubescent, hairy outside, glabrous, smooth, without hairs inside.  Flowers  The sepals of Pachypodium baronii are no different than most sepals in other flowering plants (angiosperms) in forming an outer floral envelop. In P. baronii's case, the sepals are dark green, connate at the base for about 0.2 mm (.008 (0.098-inch), persistent until maturity of the flower, and ovate or narrowly so. They measure 1.5‚Äì2.5 times as long as they are wide at 2.5 mm (inch) to 6 mm (inch) in length by 1.5 mm (0.059-inch) to 2.5 mm (0.098-inch). They are acuminate at the apex and glabrous, smooth, to sparsely pubescent, slightly hairy, outside and glabrous inside.  Corolla  The collective term for all the petals of a flower or the inner whorl of the perianth; the corolla of Pachypodium baronii is limb and crimson with a corolla tube. The basal part of the corolla tube, the part of the corolla where the petals are united to form a funnel shaped cylinder, is pale green, whereas the upper part is part greenish-red outside and inside pale yellow or pale green. Inside these colors are shaped like a star or ring in pattern. They are surrounded by a dark red throat, measuring 2.5 cm (inch) to 4 cm (inch) long in the mature bud. The corolla tube forms a comparatively wide and broadly ovoid, broad and rounded at the base and tapering toward the end, head that measures 0.4 to 0.5 times the tube's length, thus, at 1 cm (0.39-inch) to 1.9 cm (0.75-inch) long by 0.7 cm (0.28-inch) to 1.1 cm (0.43-inch) wide. At the apex, the bud is acuminate, tapering gradually to a sharp point, to obtuse, having a blunt or rounded tip. Whereas it is (I) glabrous or sparsely pubescent to often partly pubescent outside, inside it is (II) glabrous on the part of the lobes covering the bud and glabrous for 6 mm (0.236-inch) to 7 mm (0.276-inch) from the base. A pubescent belt located inside the corolla tube is 4 mm (0.158-inch) to 7 mm (0.276-inch) below the insertion of the stamens, the male reproductive organ of a flower, to the mouth. The mouth is more densely pubescent and hairy. The corolla tube is 4.4 to 6 times as long as the calyx, which is 1.13 to 1.22 times as long as the corolla lobes. Therefore, the corolla tube is 15 mm (inch) to 23 mm (inch) long. Its basal part is almost cylindrical, but often conically widened at the base. It is 0.39 to 0.44 times the length of the entire tube at 7 mm (0.276-inch) to 9 mm (0.354-inch) long by 2 mm (0.079-inch) to 4.8 mm (0.189-inch) wide. The upper part is almost cylindrical at 8 mm (0.315-inch) to 14 mm (0.551-inch) long. It slightly narrows at the mouth to be 3 mm (0.118-inch) to 4 mm (0.158-inch) wide. The corolla lobes are obliquely and broadly obovate, egg-shaped and flat with the narrow end attached to the stalk, at 0.8 to 0.9 times as long as the tube, hence measuring at 1.35 to 1.6 times as long as it is wide at 15 mm (0.591-inch) to 19 mm (0.75-inch) long by 11 mm (0.43-inch) to 17 mm (0.67-inch) wide. The lobes are rounded at their apex and ciliate at the edge, or margin.  Stamens  With an apex 4 mm (0.158-inch) to 4.5 mm (0.177-inch) below the mouth of the corolla tube, Pachypodium baronii's stamens are inserted at 0.47 to 0.6 the length of the corolla tube. It measures at 1.0 cm (0.394-inch) to 1.4 cm (0.551-inch) from the base. The stamen is the male reproductive organ of a flower where it usually has a filament and, at least, an anther. A filament is usually thin short or elongated stalk of the stamen that carries the anther at the upper end; whereas the anther is the part of the stamen that bear the pollen. In baronii, the anthers are very narrowly triangular at 5 to 6 times as long as wide, measuring 6 mm (0.236-inch) to 6.5 mm (0.256-inch) in length by 1.0 mm (0.039-inch) to 1.3 mm (0.051-inch) wide. They are pubescent inside at the base of the connective, the sterile part of the anther as opposed to the theca, which is the part of the anther that carries pollen, and are just below where the anther occurs with the pistil head, part of the female reproductive organ in a flower.  Pistil  The pistil is the female reproductive organ of a flower that is composed of an ovary and several free carpels the style and the stigma. A carpel is the modified leaf that contains the ovules and has a style and a stigma on top. The style is the stalk-like portion that connects the stigma and the carpel or ovary; whereas the stigma, itself, is the top most receptive region of the style, commonly divided. In Pachypodium baronii the pistil is 12.5 mm (0.49-inch) to 14.5 mm (0.57-inch) long. The ovary measures 2 mm (0.078-inch) to 2.5 mm (0.098-inch) long by 1.8 mm (0.071-inch) to 2.2 mm (0.87-inch) wide by 1.5 mm (0.059-inch) high. It is pubescent on the part not covered by the disk, a disk-like structure that secretes nectar. In P. baronii, the disk is composed of five unequal glands, where 2 or 2 pairs are fused partly or entirely. These glands are ovate and measure 1.7 mm (0.067-inch) to 2 mm (0.079-inch) high. They are rounded at the apex and are more than half as long as the ovary. The style is 9.3 mm (0.37-inch) to 11 mm (0.43-inch) long and sparsely pubescent. The pistil head is cylindrical and is at 1.0 mm (.039-inch) to 1.3 mm (0.51-inch) high. It is composed of an obconical, inverted conical shape, basal part, which is 0.5 mm (0.020-inch) to 0.65 mm (0.26-inch) long by 0.4 mm (0.016-inch) to 0.5 mm (0.020-inch) wide. The pistil has a ring-shaped central part measuring 0.5 mm (0.020-inch) to 0.7 mm (0.028-inch) long by 0.6mm (0.024-inch) to 0.7 mm (0.028-inch). It has a stigmoid apex 0.1 mm (0.004-inch) to 0.2 mm (0.008-inch) by to 0.4 mm (0.016-inch). The ovules are approximately 50 in each carpel. = Fruit = The fruit of Pachypodium baronii is made up of 2 separate mericarps, the part of the ovary or carpel that has one or more enclosed seeds. Sometimes only one fruit develops with an angle of 45‚Äì180¬∞ at the base. Sometimes flowers and fruit are on the same inflorescence. The mericarps are pale reddish-green with longitudinal lines when fresh and when dried pale brown to pale greenish-brown to dark brown outside and whitish to very pale brown inside. The fruit measures 40 mm (1.58-inch) to 115 mm (4.53-inch) long by 10 mm (0.39-inch) to wide by 7 mm (0.28-inch) to 10 mm (0.39-inch) high. When the fruit is fresh it is either straight or recurved, obtuse to acute at the apex. It is pubescent and has a wall 1 mm (inch) thick. = Seeds = The seed of Pachypodium baronii is pale brown with margin medium brown when fresh. It is ovate to elliptic at 6 mm (0.236-inch) to 7 mm (0.256-inch) by 3 mm (0.118-inch) to 3.8 mm (0.150-inch). It is rounded at the apex, obtuse at the base, and has a margin that is revolute towards the hilar side. The testa is smooth. The coma is straw-colored and at 1 cm (0.39-inch) to 1.5 cm (0.59-inch) long. The embryo is whitish at 5 mm (0.197-inch) by 6 mm (0.236-inch) long. The cotyledons are ovate and 1.14 to 1.2 times as long as it is wide at 3 mm (0.118-inch) to 4 mm (0.158-inch) long by 2.5 mm (0.98-inch) to 3.5 mm (0.138-inch) wide. They are rounded at the apex and cordate at the base with a rootlet 0.6 to 0.8 times as long as the cotyledons at 2 mm (0.079-inch) to long by 1.0 mm (0.039-inch) to 1.8 mm (0.071-inch) wide. Ecology Pachypodium baronii is found on three different substrate, where two are similar and one is not. It can be located on mainly steep gneiss but sometimes granite rocks (metamorphic basement) and Mesozoic calcareous rock. \\"metamorphic basement\\" means a geological complex of undifferentiated igneous and metamorphic rocks where the rocks themselves have altered their composition, texture, or internal structure through extreme heat, pressure, and the introduction of a chemical. Granite and gneiss, in this condition of being undifferentiated, tend to have an acidi pH level; whereas calcareous rock tends to be more basic. This flexibility in substrate demonstrates a less specialized geological environment. These steep rocks are often located in low open dry, xeric deciduous western forests where they take advantage of micro- environments suitable for succulents. Micro-environments means a delimited convergence of very localize landscape and climate conditions that are in stark contrast to the larger vegetative climatic environmental zone. Pachypodium baronii prefers open sunlight but will tolerate some indirect light conditions because they inhabit open deciduous forests. They grow at an altitude between 300 m (feet) to 1200 m (feet) . Other vegetative types, often site indicators of micro-environments, are associated with P. baronii in habitats, such as Pachypodium sofiense Apocynaceae, Uncarina sp., (Pedialaceae) Aloe bulbillifera (Asphodelaceae), Euphorbia milii (Euphorbaceae), Kalanchoe gastonis-bonieri (Crassulaceae), and Urera sp. (Urticaceae). =Cultivation= The substrate for Pachypodium baronii in cultivation is an acidic loose peat mixed with gneiss sand at a pH level of 4. Temperatures from spring to autumn, day and night are respectively . In the winter, night and day temperatures should range from or more. It will after four years of growth flower profusely in the spring. As well, it needs a larger pot size than other Pachypodium species. It water regime is to water a lot during growing season and very little during the resting time only to prohibit drying out of roots. Propagation is by seeds.

Directed by John Huston, it was produced by Gottfried Reinhardt with Dore Schary as executive producer. The screenplay is by John Huston, adapted by Albert Band from Stephen Crane's 1895 novel of the same name. The cinematography is by Harold Rosson, and the music score by Bronislau Kaper. The making of this film is the subject of Lillian Ross's 1952 book Picture, originally in The New Yorker. The American Civil War film is a sparse but faithful retelling of the story, incorporating narration from the text to move the plot forward. Audie Murphy, a hero of World War II who later went into acting, played the lead role of Henry Fleming. Other actors include cartoonist Bill Mauldin, Andy Devine, Arthur Hunnicutt and Royal Dano. Plot The plot is based on the book with fewer bloody details. A regiment of Union soldiers head South to engage Confederate forces. Joining them is Henry Fleming (Audie Murphy), a green private sent into battle for the first time. He is unprepared for the fight, but by the time battle breaks out, he finds his endurance and courage tested.Ross, Lillian. Picture, 1952. Cast * Audie Murphy as Henry Fleming (aka The Youth) * Bill Mauldin as Tom Wilson (aka The Loud Soldier) * Douglas Dick as The Lieutenant * Royal Dano as The Tattered Man * John Dierkes as Jim Conklin (aka The Tall Soldier) * Arthur Hunnicutt as Bill Porter * Tim Durant as The General * Andy Devine as The Cheery Soldier * Robert Easton as Thompson * John Huston as Grizzled Union Veteran (uncredited) * William Phipps as Union Soldier (uncredited) * William Schallert as Union Soldier (uncredited) * James Whitmore as Narrator (voice, uncredited) Production Director John Huston used unusual compositions and camera angles drawn from film noir to create an alienating battlefield environment. He became frustrated when the studio cut the film's length to 70 minutes and added narration taken from the original novel following supposedly poor audience test screenings. Much of the history of the making of this film, considered by some a mutilated masterpiece, is found in Lillian Ross' critically acclaimed book Picture. Of the stars who appear in the film, three served in World War II: Bill Mauldin the editorial cartoonist who created \\"Up Front\\", Audie Murphy served with the U.S. Army in Europe, and narrator James Whitmore served with the U.S. Marine Corps. The film is available on DVD. John Huston had high hopes for this movie, even considered the original two-hour cut of the film as the best he had ever made as a director. After a power struggle at the top of MGM management, the film was cut from a two-hour epic to the 69-minute version released to theaters in response to its alleged universally disastrous previews. It never was released as an \\"A\\" feature but was shown as a second-feature \\"B\\" picture. Both Huston and star Audie Murphy tried unsuccessfully to purchase the film so that it could be re-edited to its original length. Huston did not waste any time fighting over it because he was focused on the pre-production of his next picture, The African Queen. The studio claimed that the cut footage was destroyed, probably in the 1965 MGM vault fire. Huston later was asked by MGM in 1975 if he had an original cut because the studio wanted to release it. He actually had struck a 16mm print, but by that time, it had been lost. Reception According to MGM records, the film earned $789,000 in the US and Canada and $291,000 in other countries, resulting in a loss of $1,018,000. This made it one of the studio's least successful films of the year although it did not lose as much money as Calling Bulldog Drummond, Mr Imperium or Inside Straight.

They were joined by Rahul Ram in 1991, and in 1991 by multi- instrumentalist Amit Kilam completing the quartet. Using Indian rhythms, melodies and folk music influences the band created a unique sound and soon achieved success; in following decades produced five studio albums, and a live album, Desert Rain. Besides this a concert DVD, Indian Ocean Live In Concert of their two-hour live concert at the Garden of Five Senses in Delhi was released in 2008. Leaving Home ‚Äì the Life & Music of Indian Ocean (2010) directed by Jaideep Varma, it became the first band ever in India to be subject of a documentary. At the 58th National Film Awards, the documentary went on to win the Award for Best Arts/Cultural Film. Founder member, Chakrvarty died suddenly in 2009, due to heart attack. Sen released his first solo debut album Depths of the Ocean in 2011, an album which had been in the making for the last ten years. Featuring collaboration with Shubha Mudgal, Nitin Malik, Papon, and Asheem Chakravarty. In 2012, he started touring with a new setup of artistes, called The Susmit Sen Chronicles, which included drummer Nikhil Vasudevan, bassist Anirban Ghosh, tabla player Varun Gupta and vocalists Amit Sharma and Sudhir Rikhari. Thereafter Sen left Indian Ocean in June 2013, to pursue his solo career. However, he joined the Indian Ocean for a farewell tour in end 2013, thereafter he was replaced by guitarist Nikhil Rao. Early, 2014 saw the release of an eponymously titled coffee table photography book on the group's history. As a tribute, the Dehradun Guitar Company has created the SS Series of Guitars named after Susmit Sen.Dehradun Guitar Company, the Super Sustain guitar named after Susmit Sen He started work on his second solo-album in October 2013 and completed it in following March. In July 2014, the album Ocean to Ocean was released, which also featured a collaborative track with Bernie Marsden, the former Whitesnake guitarist. Later in the year he released his memoir, Ocean to Ocean: A Memoir co-written with Sehba Imam. In its 2014 listing of \\"25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs of the last 25 Years\\", \\"Rolling Stone India\\" featured two songs, Ma Rewa and Kandisa from the album, Kandisa (2000).

Abt denied that the group was a spy ring, noting that the security classification system did not yet exist, and none of the documents he had access to involved national security. Background Abt was born on May 1, 1904 in Chicago, Illinois. He was a graduate of the University of Chicago, and from its law school. Career Abt practiced real estate and corporate law in Chicago from 1927 to 1933. =Government (1933‚Äì1938)= Robert M. La Follette Jr Abt was the Chief of Litigation, Agricultural Adjustment Administration from 1933 to 1935, assistant general counsel of the Works Progress Administration in 1935 (where Lee Pressman was also working), chief counsel to Senator Robert La Follette, Jr.'s Committee from 1936 to 1937 and special assistant to the United States Attorney General, 1937 and 1938. =Unions (1938‚Äì1948)= From 1938 to 1948, he worked at chief counsel of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union under Sidney Hillman, who hired him. By this time, the ACW had affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). FBI mugshot of Eugene Dennis (1948) In his memoir, Abt claimed that leaders of the Communist Party of the USA had inspired the idea of the CIO-PAC: > In 1943, Gene Dennis came to me and Lee Pressman to first raise the idea of > a political action committee to organize labor support for Roosevelt in the > approaching 1944 election. Pressman approached Murray with the idea, as I > did with Hillman. Both men seized upon the proposal with great enthusiasm. Abt and Pressman became the CIO-PAC's co-counsels. (Thus, in 1943, as American spy Elizabeth Bentley resurrected the Ware Group [of which Abt had been a member], Abt could not risk involvement with her or the group. Instead, the group reformed without him under Victor Perlo as the Perlo Group. ) By January 1946, he was also working as general counsel for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and traveled to Russia with a CIO delegation, which included Pressman. (The CIO had long-term support from communists; in 1947, CIO leaders like Walter Reuther pushed out communist elements and again in 1949 after the CIO's merger with the American Federation of Labor [AFL] to form the AFL-CIO.) =Politics (1946‚Äì1948)= American Labor Party logo In September 1946, Abt appeared on the New York state ticket of American Labor Party candidates: Benjamin Fielding for Lieutenant Governor, Harry J. Chapman for State Controller, Joseph Lucchi for Attorney General, John T. Loughran for Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, and John Abt for Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals. In October 1946, he (as CIO general counsel) joined other \\"liberal and progressive groups\\" in forming the new Progressive Party. =Progressive Party (1948)= In February 1948, Abt left the Amalgamated and Lee Pressman left the CIO to go work for the Progressive Party to support its presidential candidate, former Vice President Henry A. Wallace. At the time, the Washington Post dubbed Abt, Pressman, and Calvin Benham \\"Beanie\\" Baldwin (C. B. Baldwin) as \\"influential insiders\\" and \\"stage managers\\" in the Wallace campaign. He also supported the candidacy in New York of Vito Marcantonio, a leader of the American Labor Party. =CPUSA Counsel (1950‚Äì1970s)= From 1951 to 1953, Abt joined Vito Marcantonio and Joseph Forer in defending the CPUSA on a charge from the McCarran Act. In January 1955 Abt defended Claude Lightfoot in Chicago, an African-American Communist on trial under the 1940 Smith Act for belonging to a group that advocates the overthrow of the US government. This trial marked the first time the government attempted to convict an individual solely as a member of a group conspiring against the nation, rather than for individual actions. Although Abt's short and simple defense did not succeed at this trial, Lightfoot's conviction was ultimately overturned by the US Supreme Court in 1964. In 1960, Abt again defended the CPUSA before the U.S. Supreme Court on the constitutionality of the McCarran Act. In 1961, however, the Court sustained the section of the act requiring Communist-action organizations to register with the Government by a vote of five to four. During Lee Harvey Oswald's interrogation by the Dallas Police on the evening of 22 November 1963, pending his arraignment for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, he requested the services of Mr. Abt: > I want that attorney in New York, Mr. Abt. I don't know him personally but I > know about a case that he handled some years ago, where he represented the > people who had violated the Smith Act, [which made it illegal to teach or > advocate the violent overthrow of the U.S. government] ... I don't know him > personally, but that is the attorney I want. ... If I can't get him, then I > may get the American Civil Liberties Union to send me an attorney. However, Abt and his wife had left New York City that day for a weekend at their cabin in Connecticut. He did not learn of Oswald's request until the following day. He told reporters that he had received no request either from Oswald or from anyone on his behalf to represent him, and so was in no position to give a definite answer. He said later that \\"if I were requested to represent him, I felt that it would probably be difficult, if not impossible, for me to do so because of my commitments to other clients.\\"Testimony of John J. Abt, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 10, p. 116. In 1965, the Supreme Court ruled that individuals may invoke their constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and refuse to register with the Government as members of the US Communist Party. Abt considered this decision as his greatest legal victory. Angela Davis (center, no glasses) enters Royce Hall (1969) Abt was one of the first attorneys to represent Angela Davis for her alleged involvement in the 1970 Marin County courthouse incident. Margaret Burnham worked with him and later wrote a foreword to his memoir. Alleged espionage Chairman Martin Dies, Jr. of HUAC proofs his letter replying to FDR's attack on his committee (1938) =Ware Group (1934‚Äì1944)= Abt was also a member of the Ware Group, a covert organization of Communist Party operatives within the United States government in the 1930s, which actively aided Soviet intelligence by passing on government information, as well as furnishing assistance to members of the CPUSA. Abt's sister, Marion Bachrach, was also a member of the group. After the group's founder, Harold Ware, was killed in an automobile collision in 1935, Abt married Jessica Smith, Ware's widow. In late 1943, Jacob Golos, who headed the CPUSA's secret apparatus, was referred to a spy ring of party members by General Secretary of the party, Earl Browder. This ring had been engaged for some time in espionage for Browder, and held regular clandestine meetings at Abt's apartment. In early 1944, Golos sent Elizabeth Bentley to make contact with the group at Abt's apartment. In attendance was Abt, Victor Perlo, Charles Kramer, Harry Magdoff and Edward Fitzgerald. They discussed paying party dues to Bentley, the various types of information each would be able to deliver, and the type of information other members not in attendance would also be willing to deliver. In late 1943, the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation of Abt. Its surveillance showed frequent meetings in the early months of 1944 between Abt and a man then known as Alexander Stevens, one of the several pseudonyms used by the shadowy J. Peters, a party 'enforcer' who at one time headed the CPUSA's secret apparatus, and was involved in clandestine Soviet intelligence activities in the U.S., until his deportation to Hungary in 1948. =Hiss Case (1948)= Whittaker Chambers (1948) In 1948, under subpoena before HUAC, Whittaker Chambers named Abt among members of the Ware Group. Abt refused to give testimony. (In 1996, it became known that Abt was referenced in Venona decrypts #588 KGB New York to Moscow, 29 April 1944 and #687 KGB New York to Moscow, 13 May 1944.KGB agent & Earl Browder instruct Bentley on new recruits , Venona 687 New York to Moscow, 13 May 1944.) =Named by Pressman (1950)= Lee Pressman (1938) Called again before Congress to give testimony on Communist Party activities, on August 28, 1950, Lee Pressman reversed his previous decision to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights and gave testimony against his former comrades. Pressman stated: > In my desire to see the destruction of Hitlerism and an improvement in > economic conditions here at home, I joined a Communist group in Washington, > D. C, about 1934. My participation in such group extended for about a year, > to the best of my recollection. I recall that about the latter part of 1935‚Äî > the precise date I cannot recall, but it is a matter of public record ‚Äî I > left the Government service and left Washington to reenter the private > practice of law in New York City. And at that time I discontinued any > further participation in the group from that date until the present. He stated that he had no information about the political views of his former law school classmate Alger Hiss and specifically denied that Hiss was a participant in this Washington group. He indicated that in at least one meeting of his group, perhaps two, he had met Soviet intelligence agent J. Peters.Hearings Regarding Communism in the United States Government ‚Äî Part 2, pp. 2855-2856. Although he made no mention of having himself conducted intelligence-gathering activities, his 1950 testimony provided the first corroboration of Chambers' allegation that a Washington, DC communist group around Ware existed, with federal officials Nathan Witt, John Abt and Charles Kramer named as members of this party cell. TIME magazine mocked Pressman in its reportage in the issue following his hearing: > Like many another smart young man who followed the Communist line, sharp- > eyed, sharply dressed Attorney Lee Pressman did very well for a long time. > Har-vardman Pressman launched his leftward-turning career in Henry Wallace's > AAA back in 1933, ended up as chief counsel of the CIO. He held the post for > twelve years. But though he was a skilled labor lawyer, his fellow-traveling > finally became too much for Phil Murray; 2¬Ω years ago, Murray tearfully > threw him out. > His star did not entirely wane. He became a power among the back-room Reds > who steered Henry Wallace through the presidential campaign. But when the > Korean war began, he, like Wallace, began slipping away from his Commie > cronies. California's Congressman Richard Nixon, scenting opportunity, > decided to call him before the House Un-American Activities Committee and > ask him a few questions. (Once before, when Whittaker Chambers named > Pressman as a member of the same elite apparatus as Alger Hiss, Pressman had > taken refuge in the Fifth Amendment, refused to answer Congressmen's > questions.) > Last week, Pressman decided to reverse his field... > This week ... he reluctantly consented to name three men who had been > fellow Communists in the '30s‚ÄîJohn Abt, Nathan Witt and Charles Kramer... =Confession= In his memoir posthumously published in 1993, Abt revealed that the Ware Group was a Communist Party unit and that he had been a member. Personal life and death On March 14, 1937, Abt married Jessica Smith Ware, widow of Harold Ware; she died in 1983. Later, he married Vita Barsky. In 1984, on his 80th birthday, Abt admitted to being a long-time member of the CPUSA. On August 10, 1991, Abt died at the Columbia-Greene Medical Center in Hudson, New York from a stroke. He was 87. Works Abt's memoir appeared in print in 1993, some two years after his death in 1991. In its review, the peer-reviewed Labor Studies Journal expressed doubt in many of Abt's major claims (e.g., \\"To hear John Abt tell about it, the chief counsel to the American Communist party knew virtually nothing about the inner workings of the party\\") and in fact \\"shed a dark light on Communist morality and class position.\\" * Advocate and Activist: Memoirs of an American Communist Lawyer (University of Illinois Press 1993).

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is an integral membrane protein expressed in many tissues and concentrated in the synapses of neurons. Its primary function is not known, though it has been implicated as a regulator of synapse formation, neural plasticity, antimicrobial activity, and iron export. APP is best known as the precursor molecule whose proteolysis generates amyloid beta (AŒ≤), a polypeptide containing 37 to 49 amino acid residues, whose amyloid fibrillar form is the primary component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients.  Genetics  APP is an ancient and highly conserved protein. In humans, the gene for APP is located on chromosome 21 and contains 18 exons spanning 290 kilobases. Several alternative splicing isoforms of APP have been observed in humans, ranging in length from 639 to 770 amino acids, with certain isoforms preferentially expressed in neurons; changes in the neuronal ratio of these isoforms have been associated with Alzheimer's disease. Homologous proteins have been identified in other organisms such as Drosophila (fruit flies), C. elegans (roundworms), and all mammals. The amyloid beta region of the protein, located in the membrane-spanning domain, is not well conserved across species and has no obvious connection with APP's native-state biological functions. Mutations in critical regions of amyloid precursor protein, including the region that generates amyloid beta (AŒ≤), cause familial susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease. For example, several mutations outside the AŒ≤ region associated with familial Alzheimer's have been found to dramatically increase production of AŒ≤. A mutation (A673T) in the APP gene protects against Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. This substitution is adjacent to the beta secretase cleavage site and results in a 40% reduction in the formation of amyloid beta in vitro.  Structure  The metal-binding domain of APP with a bound copper ion. The side chains of the two histidine and one tyrosine residues that play a role in metal coordination are shown in the Cu(I) bound, Cu(II) bound, and unbound conformations, which differ by only small changes in orientation. The extracellular E2 domain, a dimeric coiled coil and one of the most highly conserved regions of the protein from Drosophila to humans. This domain, which resembles the structure of spectrin, is thought to bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans.; A number of distinct, largely independently-folding structural domains have been identified in the APP sequence. The extracellular region, much larger than the intracellular region, is divided into the E1 and E2 domains, linked by an acidic domain (AcD); E1 contains two subdomains including a growth factor-like domain (GFLD) and a copper-binding domain (CuBD) interacting tightly together.; see also PDB ID A serine protease inhibitor domain, absent from the isoform differentially expressed in the brain, is found between acidic region and E2 domain. The complete crystal structure of APP has not yet been solved; however, individual domains have been successfully crystallized, the growth factor-like domain,; see also PDB ID the copper-binding domain,; See also 2007 PDB IDs , , . the complete E1 domain and the E2 domain.  Post-translational processing  APP undergoes extensive post-translational modification including glycosylation, phosphorylation, sialylation, and tyrosine sulfation, as well as many types of proteolytic processing to generate peptide fragments. It is commonly cleaved by proteases in the secretase family; alpha secretase and beta secretase both remove nearly the entire extracellular domain to release membrane-anchored carboxy-terminal fragments that may be associated with apoptosis. Cleavage by gamma secretase within the membrane-spanning domain after beta-secretase cleavage generates the amyloid-beta fragment; gamma secretase is a large multi-subunit complex whose components have not yet been fully characterized, but include presenilin, whose gene has been identified as a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's. The amyloidogenic processing of APP has been linked to its presence in lipid rafts. When APP molecules occupy a lipid raft region of membrane, they are more accessible to and differentially cleaved by beta secretase, whereas APP molecules outside a raft are differentially cleaved by the non-amyloidogenic alpha secretase. Gamma secretase activity has also been associated with lipid rafts. The role of cholesterol in lipid raft maintenance has been cited as a likely explanation for observations that high cholesterol and apolipoprotein E genotype are major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.  Biological function  Although the native biological role of APP is of obvious interest to Alzheimer's research, thorough understanding has remained elusive. = Synaptic formation and repair = The most-substantiated role for APP is in synaptic formation and repair; its expression is upregulated during neuronal differentiation and after neural injury. Roles in cell signaling, long-term potentiation, and cell adhesion have been proposed and supported by as-yet limited research. In particular, similarities in post-translational processing have invited comparisons to the signaling role of the surface receptor protein Notch. APP knockout mice are viable and have relatively minor phenotypic effects including impaired long-term potentiation and memory loss without general neuron loss. On the other hand, transgenic mice with upregulated APP expression have also been reported to show impaired long-term potentiation. The logical inference is that because AŒ≤ accumulates excessively in Alzheimer's disease its precursor, APP, would be elevated as well. However, neuronal cell bodies contain less APP as a function of their proximity to amyloid plaques. The data indicate that this deficit in APP results from a decline in production rather than an increase in catalysis. Loss of a neuron's APP may affect physiological deficits that contribute to dementia. =Somatic recombination= In neurons of the human brain, somatic recombination occurs frequently in the gene that encodes APP. Neurons from individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease show greater APP gene diversity due to somatic recombination than neurons from healthy individuals. = Anterograde neuronal transport = Molecules synthesized in the cell bodies of neurons must be conveyed outward to the distal synapses. This is accomplished via fast anterograde transport. It has been found that APP can mediate interaction between cargo and kinesin and thus facilitate this transport. Specifically, a short peptide 15-amino-acid sequence from the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminus is necessary for interaction with the motor protein. Additionally, it has been shown that the interaction between APP and kinesin is specific to the peptide sequence of APP. In a recent experiment involving transport of peptide- conjugated colored beads, controls were conjugated to a single amino acid, glycine, such that they display the same terminal carboxylic acid group as APP without the intervening 15-amino-acid sequence mentioned above. The control beads were not motile, which demonstrated that the terminal COOH moiety of peptides is not sufficient to mediate transport. = Iron export = A different perspective on Alzheimer's is revealed by a mouse study that has found that APP possesses ferroxidase activity similar to ceruloplasmin, facilitating iron export through interaction with ferroportin; it seems that this activity is blocked by zinc trapped by accumulated AŒ≤ in Alzheimer's. It has been shown that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 5'UTR of APP mRNA can disrupt its translation. The hypothesis that APP has ferroxidase activity in its E2 domain and facilitates export of Fe(II) is possibly incorrect since the proposed ferroxidase site of APP located in the E2 domain does not have ferroxidase activity. As APP does not possess ferroxidase activity within its E2 domain, the mechanism of APP-modulated iron efflux from ferroportin has come under scrutiny. One model suggests that APP acts to stabilize the iron efflux protein ferroportin in the plasma membrane of cells thereby increasing the total number of ferroportin molecules at the membrane. These iron- transporters can then be activated by known mammalian ferroxidases (i.e. ceruloplasmin or hephaestin). = Hormonal regulation = The amyloid-Œ≤ precursor protein (AŒ≤PP), and all associated secretases, are expressed early in development and play a key role in the endocrinology of reproduction ‚Äì with the differential processing of AŒ≤PP by secretases regulating human embryonic stem cell (hESC) proliferation as well as their differentiation into neural precursor cells (NPC). The pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) increases AŒ≤PP expression and hESC proliferation while progesterone directs AŒ≤PP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway, which promotes hESC differentiation into NPC. AŒ≤PP and its cleavage products do not promote the proliferation and differentiation of post-mitotic neurons; rather, the overexpression of either wild-type or mutant AŒ≤PP in post-mitotic neurons induces apoptotic death following their re-entry into the cell cycle. It is postulated that the loss of sex steroids (including progesterone) but the elevation in luteinizing hormone, the adult equivalent of hCG, post-menopause and during andropause drives amyloid-Œ≤ production and re-entry of post-mitotic neurons into the cell cycle.

At a distance of 750 meters from Rashtrapati Bhavan, it is located along Sansad Marg which crosses the Central Vista which is surrounded by the India Gate, war memorial, prime minister's office and residence, ministerial buildings and other administrative units of Indian government. It houses the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha which represent lower and upper houses respectively in India's bicameral parliament. The existing building draws inspiration from Ekattarso Mahadeva temple and was built under British empire for its Imperial Legislative Council in 1927. Following the end of British rule in India, it was taken over by Constituent Assembly of India which was succeeded by parliament of India once Constitution of India came into force in 1950. In 2010s, a proposal was introduced to revamp Central Vista and re-build or relocate a number of administrative buildings which initiated a program expecting completion in 2024. As India aims to expand the membership of its parliament, new parliament building is being built with a higher seating capacity of 1,350 members. The new building is expected to be functional in June 2022 while older one is planned to be turned into a museum thereafter.  History  House of Parliament in New Delhi, home of the Central Legislative Assembly Originally called the House of Parliament, it was designed by the British architects Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker in 1912-1913 as part of their wider mandate to construct a new administrative capital city for British India. Construction of the Parliament House began in 1921 and it was completed in 1927. The opening ceremony of the Parliament House, which then housed the Imperial Legislative Council, was performed on 18 January 1927 by Lord Irwin, Viceroy of India. The third session of Central Legislative Assembly was held in this house on 19 January 1927. Two floors were added to the structure in 1956 due to a demand for more space.https://indianexpress.com/article/india/central-vista-project-new-delhi- dr-bimal-patel-parliament-prime-minister-office-rajpath-6212011/ The Parliament Museum, opened in 2006, stands next to the Parliament House in the building of the Parliamentary Library. Building The perimeter of the building is circular, with 144 columns on the outside. At the centre of the building is the circular Central Chamber, and surrounding this Chamber are three semicircular halls that were constructed for the sessions of the Chamber of Princes (now used as the Library Hall), the State Council (now used for the Rajya Sabha), and the Central Legislative Assembly (now used for the Lok Sabha). The building is surrounded by large gardens and the perimeter is fenced off by sandstone railings (jali). Construction of new building Proposals for a new parliament building to replace the existing complex emerged in early 2010s on account of stability concerns with older structure. A committee to suggest several alternatives to the current building had been set up by then Speaker, Mira Kumar in 2012. The present building, an 85-year- old structure, suffers from inadequacy of space to house members and their staff and is thought to suffer from structural issues. The building although also needs to be protected because of its heritage. Government in 2019 launched Central Vista Redevelopment Project that included revamping Rajpath, making a new office and residence for Indian prime minister, construction of a new parliament and combining all ministerial buildings in a single central secretariat. The proposed Lok Sabha chamber is expected to have increased seating capacity to accommodate more members as number of MPs may increase with India's population and consequent future delimitation. The Lok Sabha may need to have 848 members by 2026. The new complex will be able to house 900 Lok Sabha MPs and 1350 members in total. According to Bimal Patel, the architect in charge of the redesign of Central Vista, the new complex is likely to have a triangular shape. It will be built next to the existing complex and will be much bigger than former one. The North and South Blocks of the Secretariat Building, which currently house ministries, will be converted into museums. The relocation of the Prime Minister's Office and other ministries will take place alongside a redesign of Rajpath. Work on foundation of new parliament building has already begun in early October 2020. Incidents On 13 December 2001, the Parliament House was attacked by five Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists. In addition to all the attackers, six military personnel and one civilian were killed.

He has also worked with artists such as Michael Jackson. Viral video Bernal first became known through a video of him performing a dance at the Kollaboration, an Asian American arts festival, in 2001 that went viral. The clip showcased Bernal's characteristic take on the contemporary dance styles of popping and abstract waving. Performances of these dances were rare at the time, and the clip became very popular when it circulated on the internet ‚Äî so popular that in November 2006, The Viral Factory, a viral marketing company, collated page- impression figures from websites such as YouTube and Google Videos. They determined that, as of November 2006, this video had been viewed over 200 million times, making it the 8th most viewed video. Bernal is not double jointed, a popular misconception. He says: \\"I‚Äôm not double-jointed at all. The only place where I am double-jointed in my thumbs, which doesn‚Äôt even matter. I would say I‚Äôm probably a little more flexible than most people in certain areas, mainly my shoulders and my ankles, but I wasn‚Äôt born that way. Those areas became flexible because of years of practicing.\\" Career Following his exposure in the viral video, Bernal was hired to participate in a number of advertisements, such as Heineken (dancing to \\"Cobrastyle\\" by the Teddybears), Volkswagen, Apple iPod, 7-Eleven Slurpee, Pepsi, Puma, and Doritos. He also made a cameo appearance in the movie You Got Served and TV performances including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Computer graphics technology were used in several of the commercials Bernal took part in, superimposing others' faces (old, young, male, female) onto his body so that they appeared to dance like him.

He also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He is a six-time All-Star, won a World Series with the Phillies in 2008, and was chosen as the second baseman on the Sports Illustrated All-Decade Team for the 2000s. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. After becoming a permanent fixture as the Phillies' second baseman, Utley demonstrated versatility, spending some time at first base as well. As his fielding improved, he and shortstop Jimmy Rollins were regarded as one of the best middle-infield combinations in the NL until Rollins was traded to the Dodgers in the winter of 2014. Utley was considered by fans to be a team leader of the Phillies, alongside Rollins and Ryan Howard, and he has been noted for his leadership qualities with the Dodgers.Dodgers Rave About Chase Utley‚Äôs Leadership ¬´ CBS PhillyDodgers have learned, 'you don't ever want to disappoint Chase' Utley was known for his quiet understated demeanor, instead setting an example for teammates with his exhaustive preparation in the video room and the batting cage.2009 World Series: Chase Utley saying little, except with his booming bat - MLB PlayoffsArchives - Philly.comRich Westcott: Chase Utley will be missed by Phillies fans, and animal lovers, too Utley's seven career World Series home runs are the most for a second baseman, and he shares the single-series postseason record of five home runs with Reggie Jackson and George Springer. Utley also holds the major league record for most stolen bases in a single season without being caught, set in 2009 when he stole 23 bases. He is also noteworthy for having participated in seven no-hitters, of which he was on the winning side in four. Early life Utley was born in Pasadena, California, and was raised in Long Beach, California, with his younger sister, Taylor Ann. He is the son of David and Terrell Utley. =Amateur career= Utley played baseball at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, alongside former MLB player, Milton Bradley (baseball) and at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for the UCLA Bruins. In high school, his coach said that Utley had \\"the fastest hands he had ever seen on a high school player.\\" He hit over .500 his senior year, with a slugging percentage of over 1.000, struck out just twice in 80 at bats, and earned high school All-American honors. He also set a school single-season record with 14 home runs Utley was drafted in the second round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers with the 76th pick, but turned down a $850,000 offer by the Dodgers to attend UCLA. A star shortstop in high school, the Bruins instead moved him to second base because his arm strength was more of a liability at shortstop. He hit .382 with 22 home runs as a junior at UCLA in 2000 while leading the Bruins to the NCAA Super Regionals. He was selected to the All-Pac-10 team and the Sporting News and National Collegiate Baseball Writers first team All-American teams. While at UCLA, Utley played collegiate summer baseball for the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League in 1998, and returned to the league in 1999 to play for the Cotuit Kettleers. Early career Utley was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the first round (15th pick) of the 2000 amateur draft. At the time, the team's scouting director claimed he was a combination of Jeff Kent and Adam Kennedy. He signed on July 29, 2000, for a $1,780,000 signing bonus. Utley played for the Phillies' farm system with the Batavia Muckdogs of the Class A-Short Season New York‚ÄìPenn League in 2000, the Clearwater Phillies of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2001, and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of the Class AAA International League in 2002 and 2003. He was selected to the All-Star Futures Game in 2001 and made the International League post-season all-star team in 2003. Major leagues =Philadelphia Phillies= 2003‚Äì05: Early career Utley made his major league debut on April 4, 2003, as a pinch hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was struck out swinging by Jeff Suppan in his first at-bat. In his first major league start, on April 24 against the Colorado Rockies, Utley recorded his first major league hit, a grand slam off Aaron Cook. He was optioned back to the minors on April 30 recalled by the Phillies again in August 2003, to replace Pl√°cido Polanco at second base (Polanco was moved to third to compensate for the loss of third baseman David Bell to the disabled list). Utley scored the final game winning RBI in Phillies history at Veterans Stadium, on September 27, 2003. Utley recorded the final at-bat at Veterans Stadium by grounding into a game-ending double play on September 28, 2003. In 43 games, he had a .239 batting average. By the end of 2004, it became evident to management that Utley was the team's future second baseman. However, a roster spot was not permanently available; his path to the majors was effectively blocked by Polanco. Despite his out-playing Polanco for much of the season, he remained on the bench despite Phillies fans and media commentators asking why he wasn't playing more. He played in 94 games for the Phillies in 2004 (which included 13 at first base) and hit .266 with 13 homers and 57 RBI. In June 2005, the Phillies traded Polanco to the Tigers for pitcher Ugueth Urbina and infielder Ram√≥n Mart√≠nez. As a full-time starter Utley hit .291 with 28 homers and 105 RBI and also stole 16 bases. He was selected by the Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America as the co-recipient of the 2005 Mike Schmidt Most Valuable Player Award. 2006 Utley was a member of Team USA in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, and was selected by fans to start at second base for the National League at the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh. In November, he traveled to Japan with other major league stars to compete against Japanese All-Stars in an exhibition tournament. During the 2006 season, Utley maintained a 35-game hitting streak‚Äîthe second-longest streak in Phillies history behind teammate Jimmy Rollins, who hit for 38 straight games between 2005 and 2006 (36 games in 2005 and two in 2006). Utley tied Luis Castillo, who had a 35-game hitting streak in 2002, for the longest hitting streak by a second baseman. Utley's streak was also the longest for a purely left-handed hitter since Tommy Holmes' 37-game streak in 1945. As a result, Utley was named the National League Player of the Month for July 2006. On September 24, Utley hit two home runs in a 10‚Äì7 win over the Florida Marlins. It was his seventh multi-home run game of the 2006 season, tying a franchise record set in 1968 and tied by Ryan Howard in 2006. Utley combined with Jimmy Rollins in 2006 to become the first pair of middle infielders in National League history to hit 25 home runs each in the same season; Utley hit 32, while Rollins hit 25. He later received the Silver Slugger Award for being the best hitting second baseman in the National League. He also batted .309 in 2006 with 32 homers and 102 RBI. 2007 Utley hits a home run on March 11, 2007 against the Detroit Tigers during spring training.

After starting the season hot, Utley was again selected by the fans to be the starting second baseman in the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, which was his second All-Star selection. However, on July 26, Utley was hit by a pitch thrown by Washington Nationals pitcher John Lannan; he broke the fourth metacarpal bone in his right hand. \\"I'll be back. Don't worry, guys,\\" Utley said after the game. \\"It's a break, but not that bad of a break. I definitely expect to be back ... this season.\\" He had successful surgery on his hand, but as a result of the surgery, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list. Utley returned to the lineup on August 27, hit a home run and an RBI double, went 3 for 5, and drew a curtain call from the hometown crowd. Utley finished the season with a .332 batting average, 22 home runs, 103 RBIs and 48 doubles (second in the National League). He helped the Phillies to their first playoff appearance in fourteen seasons as the team capped a dramatic comeback by clinching the National League East division title on the final day of the regular season. Utley's offensive performance also earned him a Silver Slugger Award for the second consecutive season. He had two hits in 11 at-bats as the Phillies were swept in three games by the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 National League Division Series. 2008 Chase Utley, Phillies Photo Day 2008 Through the month of April, Utley hit a league-leading 11 home runs ‚Äì including seven in the seven games from April 17‚Äì23. He completed a streak of five consecutive games with a home run, and hit .360 (good for fifth in the National League) in 111 at-bats on his way to becoming the National League's Player of the Month.

Though his bat cooled a bit in May (his monthly average was .259), Utley still hit eight more home runs in the month, breaking the Phillies franchise record for home runs before June ‚Äì Cy Williams (1923) and Ryan Howard (2006) shared the previous mark of 18 ‚Äì and knocked in 26 RBIs. When Howard hit his 15th home run on May 30, he and Utley became the first pair of Phillies to hit 15 home runs each before June. On May 13, 2008, Utley received an unexpected accolade from lifelong baseball fan (and 43rd US President) George W. Bush, who stated in an interview with politico.com that Utley would be the first position player he would select if he were an MLB team owner. He was also selected by Fitness Magazine as one of the 25 \\"fittest guys in the country.\\" On June 1, Utley hit his Major League-leading 20th home run and drove in his National League-leading 50th run as part of a comeback win against the Florida Marlins that propelled the Phillies back into first place in the National League East; the 1-for-2 performance capped a productive week for Utley that earned him the National League Player of the Week Award, his fifth, for the first time since April 23‚Äì29, 2007. The next night, Utley hit another home run for another streak of five games with a longball amidst a span of eight games with seven home runs (from May 25 to June 2). Utley hit the first in a set of back-to-back-to-back Philadelphia home runs in a 20‚Äì2 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on June 13, along with Ryan Howard and Pat Burrell. It was the seventh time that the Phillies had hit three consecutive home runs, the first time since May 18, 2004, and the fourth occurrence by any team in the 2008 Major League Baseball season. Utley went a career-long 0-for-24 in the midst of a 1-for-29 slump, during which the Phillies lost a season-high six in a row. On the 21st, Utley was benched for the first time this season, ending his streak of 101 consecutive games played. On the 25th, Utley broke out of his skid with a 4-for-5 performance ‚Äì his first four-hit game of the season ‚Äì in a 4‚Äì0 shutout over the Oakland Athletics. Utley was also selected to start his third consecutive All-Star game.

Utley batted 3 for 18 (.167) in the World Series, but hit two home runs and walked five times as well. During the seventh inning of Game 5, Utley faked a throw to first, then threw Jason Bartlett out at home for the third out in a play later described as having saved the Series for the Phillies.

Utley remained confident for the 2014 season. \\"For younger guys, I think results make you feel better,\\" Utley said. \\"But as you go, you realize they're not quite as important this time of year. Physically, I feel good. Early in the spring, I felt pretty decent at the plate. There were some times in the middle when I felt a little uncomfortable and a little out of sorts. The last four or five days, I've started to feel a little more comfortable at the dish. For a guy that has done this for a few years, your game plan for Spring training is different than it would be during the regular season.\\" Despite a poor spring training, over the first two weeks of the season, he was \\"the hottest hitter in baseball\\", and as of April 13, possessed a 1.314 on-base plus slugging (OPS) average.

Major League Baseball suspended Utley for two games for his conduct \\"in violation of Official Baseball Rule 5.09 (a) (13), which is designed to protect fielders from precisely this type of rolling block that occurs away from the base.\\" Utley appealed the suspension and remained active for the rest of the Dodgers post-season games.

Early life Donald Hiss was born on December 15, 1906, in Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University and the Harvard Law School. Career =Early career: government= Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. In 1932, he was a law secretary to Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes of the United States Supreme Court. From 1933 to 1935, he was employed by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration of the United States Department of Labor. In 1934, he was also attached to a special U.S. Senate committee investigating the munitions industry. In 1935, he was employed as a special attorney by the United States Department of Justice. On September 18, 1936, he was appointed an assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State and worked in the State Department throughout World War II. In 1945, he joined the law firm of Covington & Burling. =Hiss Case= Alger Hiss, brother of Donald Hiss, circa 1950 On August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers included the name of Donald Hiss along with his brother Alger and more than half a dozen other former Federal officials as members of the Ware Group and of the Communist Party when testifying under subpoena to HUAC. On August 7, 1948, Chambers stated to the committee, \\"I can give you the general impression. He was much less intelligent than Alger. Much less sensitive than his brother.\\" Hiss retained Nebraskan Hugh Cox as counsel. Cox was famous as Thurman Arnold's chief deputy,\\" as an early partner at Root Clark & Bird (later Root, Clark, Buckner & Ballantine; later Dewey Ballantine, later Dewey & LeBoeuf) and fellow attorney with Hiss at Covington & Burling, where he was called the \\"perfect advocate\\" ) during the Hiss-Chambers Case.\\" On August 13, 1948, like his brother and Harry Dexter White, Hiss denied the allegation, stating: > I flatly deny every statement made by Mr. Chambers with respect to me. I am > not, and never have been, a member of the Communist Party or of any formal > or informal organizations affiliated with, or fronting in any manner > whatsoever for, the Communist Party. In fact, the only organizations and > clubs to which I have belonged are the local Y.M.C.A., the Miles River Yacht > Club of Maryland, the old Washington Racquet Club, the Harvard Law School > Association, the American Society of International Law, and college > fraternities and athletic clubs. > I have no recollection of ever having met any person by the name of D. > Whittaker Chambers, nor do I recognize his photograph which I have seen in > the public press. I am not and never have been in sympathy with the > principles of the Communist Party ... I have never known that man by the > name of Chambers, Carl, or any other name... > If I am lying, I should go to jail, and if Mr. Chambers is lying, he should > go to jail.\\" Unlike his brother Alger, Donald was never indicted. =Later career: private law= Dean Acheson. Donald Hiss spent the remainder of his career in private law practice with Covington & Burling. His expertise lay in international trade and tariff law. He taught international law at Catholic University and at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He retired in 1976. Dean Acheson, who famously defended the reputation of Alger Hiss, was also a member of Covington & Burling. Death Hiss died of lung cancer on May 18, 1989, in St. Michaels, Maryland.

It was founded in 2002. Originally, all of its titles were sold at a lower price than their competition ($1.99 as opposed to $2.25). Yet, despite that, the production values were higher than what their competition offered for their usual products. History Beckett enjoyed critical success with their debut title, Gene-Fusion A.D. 2310. They continued to produce acclaimed miniseries, including The Ballad of Sleeping Beauty, Fade from Grace and Ronin Hood of the 47 Samurai. Encouraged by this, they set out to publish a number of other titles, including the officially licensed adaptation of Terminator 3. In 2005, Beckett Publications was sold to Apprise Media. Beckett Comics retained their independence, but, without the support of their parent company, they found themselves without resources to publish and distribute their titles. They made a deal with Image Comics -through whom they published the Graphic novels The Cobbler's Monster and Red Warrior- to compensate for that problem. Under the terms, Beckett Comics would retain their editorial and creative independence. However, the prices of their titles would be more in line with the rest of the U.S. comic book industry. The company intends to focus on publishing original graphic novels instead of monthly issues. In 2008, Jeff Amano, the writer of many Beckett Comics titles and the cover artist for all but Ruule: Ganglords of Chinatown, resigned from his position as president of Beckett Entertainment Partners. Gabriel Benson, the author of Fade from Grace and The Ballad of Sleeping Beauty, continues to work at Beckett Entertainment pursuing projects in the comic book, film, and television industries.

The name reflects the Lundin family, former landowners in the area. Lundin House was demolished in 1876 but its Tower remains. The former Lundin Links railway station, originally on the East of Fife Railway, operated from 1857 to 1965. The village has two golf courses.

The Mazon Creek fossil beds are a conservation ' found near Morris, in Grundy County, Illinois. The fossils are preserved in ironstone concretions, formed approximately in the mid-Pennsylvanian epoch of the Carboniferous period. These concretions frequently preserve both hard and soft tissues of animal and plant materials, as well as many soft-bodied organisms that do not normally fossilize. The quality, quantity and diversity of fossils in the area, known since the mid-nineteenth century, make the Mazon Creek ' important to paleontologists, in attempting to reconstruct the paleoecology of the sites.Illinois State Museum-Mazon Creek Fossil Exhibit The locality was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997.. Geology The Mazon Creek fossils are found in the Upper Carboniferous Francis Creek Shale; the type locality is the Mazon River (or Mazon Creek), a tributary of the Illinois River near Morris, Grundy County, Illinois. The 25 to 30 meters of shale were formed approximately , during the Pennsylvanian period. The fossiliferous concretions are usually found within the thickest deposits of Francis Creek. The concretions occur in localized deposits within the silty to sandy mudstones, in the lower four metres of the formation. The paleoecosystem is believed to be a large river delta system, deposited by at least one major river system flowing from the northeast. The sediments are believed to derive from the Appalachian orogeny events. The delta had a tropical climate, a result of the area being within 10¬∞ north latitude of the equator during the Pennsylvanian. The remains of plants and animals were rapidly buried by the sediment deposited in the deltaic system. Bacterial decomposition of the remains produced carbon dioxide that combined with dissolved iron from the groundwater. This process formed siderite in the sediments surrounding the remains, forming detailed casts of their structure. Lithification of the sediments formed protective nodules of ironstone around the now fossilized remains. This mode of preservation is known as authigenic mineralisation. Location The fossiliferous concretions are found in the Mazon River area of Grundy, Will, Kankakee, and Livingston counties. Additional fossils are found in LaSalle County, Illinois; between the Vermilion River and Marseilles, Illinois. The ironstone concretions are recovered from exposures along streams, roadcuts and in active or abandoned coal mine areas. While professional geologists commonly mispronounced it MAY-zon, the correct local pronunciation is Muh-ZOHN. () Most concretions are found among the shale and sandstone that was piled up in either a spoil tip of an older underground mine, or ridges of the later surface mining. The Peabody Energy company operated several large strip mines in Grundy County that are now abandoned. They were named Pit 1 through Pit 11. The northern pits 1-8 are known for the Braidwood Biota with mostly terrestrial fauna and flora. Pit 11, which was located southwest of the town of Braidwood, Illinois, is known for its Essex Biota with a greater abundance of marine species. Pit 11 is now Braidwood State Fish and Wildlife Area, an Illinois state park. Fossil collecting is allowed at the park with a permit.http://dnr.state.il.us/Lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R2/MAZONIA.HTM#Fossil The site's importance was realized in the mid-nineteenth century: \\"the nodules of Mazon Creek, where fragments of plants, even of the softest texture, have been preserved in their integrity\\".A.H.W. in Geological Survey of Illinois, 1866, p 489 Flora The Mazon Creek flora comprises over 400 species from at least 130 genera. However, the true number of species is difficult to determine. Paleobotanists name separate plant structures with different names by convention, inflating the number of fossil plant taxa. Paleobotanists are currently determining which taxa are valid. Mazon Creek flora includes: lycopsids, related to modern club moss, with arborescent forms named Lepidophloios, Sigillaria and Lepidodendron, and herbaceous forms called Lycopodites and Cormophyton; sphenopsids like Calamites a tree-like horsetail relative, with common foliage names of Annularia and Asterophyllites, and a vine-like form called Sphenophyllum; Pteridophyta as marattitalean tree ferns and Filicales and Zygopteridales understory ferns, with common foliage names of Pecopteris, Acitheca and Lobatopteris; pteridosperms, also known as seed ferns, an extinct group of plants that grew both as trees and smaller shrubs, with features like pinnated leaves similar to true ferns, but reproduced by seeds instead of spores; they had common foliage names Mariopteris, Alethopteris, Odontopteris, Neuropteris, Laveineopteris and Macroneuropteris; extinct gymnosperm Cordaites, believed to be closely related to and sharing many features with modern conifers. Fauna Bandringa rayi fossil shark, Mazon Creek Lagerstatte. This is the holotype specimen of the species. Its size and lack of developed cartilaginous skeletal structures indicate that this is a juvenile shark. The Mazon Creek fauna has over 320 species of animals that have been identified. The fauna is divided into two components: the marine Essex fauna and the land and freshwater Braidwood fauna, that were washed into the deltaic sediments. =Essex biota= The Essex fauna includes jellyfish, sea worms, snails, saltwater clams, shrimp, sea scorpions, cephalopods and fish. The most common species found is the Essexella jellyfish. It consists of 42% of all fossil finds in the Essex biota. The Essex area also includes the most famous faunal member of the Illinois' state fossil Tullimonstrum, known popularly as the \\"Tully Monster\\". Other well- documented organisms include the crustacean Belotelson and the possible hemichordate Etacystis. =Braidwood biota= The Braidwood fauna includes insects, millipedes, centipedes, scorpions, spiders, other arachnids, amphibians, freshwater fish, freshwater shrimps, freshwater horseshoe crabs and ostracods. The oldest known beetle has been described from the Braidwood fauna. Three species of centipede have been described from Mazon Creek. They are known from around 60 specimens in total, and belong to three species: *Latzelia primordialis Scudder, 1890 (Scutigeromorpha) *Mazoscolopendra richardsoni Mundel, 1979 (Scolopendromorpha) *Palenarthrus impressus Scudder, 1890 (Scolopendromorpha) Fossil centipedes are very rare, and Mazoscolopendra and Palenarthrus are the only known Paleozoic scolopendromorphs.

The show's style was more akin to Good Morning America than SportsCenters straight news and highlights format. It included daily sports news, interviews with sports journalists, athletes, and personalities, and an assortment of other sports and non-sports topics. The original co-hosts were Jay Crawford and Kit Hoover, with Thea Andrews serving as correspondent, and Leslie Maxie as the news anchor. The ESPN executive in charge of the program was James Cohen, who helped develop ESPN's popular talk show, Pardon the Interruption. The show was part of ESPN Original Entertainment overseen by ESPN programming chief Mark Shapiro The executive producer/creator was Brian Donlon and he was assisted by Consulting Producer Steve Friedman, who oversaw NBC's Today Show during some of its most innovative and highly rated periods.http://m.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2003/10/20031013/Media/ESPN2-Hopes- Viewers-Eat-Up-Cold-Pizza.aspx The program was produced at Atlantic Video which was overseen by Todd Mason. When it launched on October 20, 2003 it started at 7 am ET, but moved to 8 am just short of its one-year anniversary in an attempt to get male viewers who may be awaking a little later. The show repeated at 10 am for the West Coast and often updated the show for the west coast feed. Although Cold Pizza was simulcast on ESPN2HD, it was not produced or presented in high definition. On October 2, 2006, DirecTV became the presenting sponsor with the show titled as Cold Pizza presented by DirecTV. In the fall of 2004, in an attempt to heighten the sports news content of the program, newspaper columnists Woody Paige and Skip Bayless were added in a series of segments called 1st & 10.http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/slicing-spinoff/370972 Moderated by Crawford, the segment aired four times per show covering 10 topics (just like in football where teams have four downs to cover 10 yards for a first down). Paige and Bayless would debate, discuss and cajole each other on the sports headlines of the day. By December 2004, re-edited segments and new wraps were transformed into a new half-hour program using the same name which aired on ESPN at 3 pm ET. In March 2005, change came in front of the camera and behind the scenes. Kit Hoover and Thea Andrews were replaced by SportsCenter anchor Dana Jacobson. At the same time, Brian Donlon left as executive producer of Cold Pizza and 1st & 10 and was replaced by SportsCenter veteran producer Mike McQuade. More change followed, on November 28, 2006, Paige left the program citing health and personal reasons, leaving New York to return to the Denver Post, where he had been a longtime writer. He was not the last Cold Pizza member to leave the New York City studio location. In May 2007, the entire program shifted production to ESPN's Bristol headquarters. The final edition of Cold Pizza aired on May 4, 2007. The following Monday, May 7, the show was replaced by a very similar program, ESPN First Take, which initially maintained many features of Cold Pizza, but instead produced in high definition at ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut. First Take (by this time with ESPN dropped from the show name) would eventually return to New York City in 2018 at the newly reconstructed Pier 17 at South Street Seaport. Broadcast history Cold Pizza was notable for having its own version of ESPN's BottomLine, as their ticker not only gave sports scores, but also news headlines and weather forecasts from sports cities and is shown in its own color scheme. It also functioned differently: it constantly scrolled, while other ESPN \\"BottomLines\\" usually \\"flip\\" through the different scores, scrolling only for long statistical lines. This graphic was discontinued in the summer of 2006, when the \\"BottomLine\\" was changed to resemble those of other ESPN programs. The program has gone on site for games and events quite often. On the road shows have included trips to Super Bowl XXXIX and XL and the Caesars Palace hotel and casino in Las Vegas. In 2004 the show had a regular series \\"Cold Pizza on Campus\\" where it went to colleges across the country big (such as Michigan State) and small (Mount Union College, a Division III football powerhouse. In an effort to save costs Friday's shows eventually originated from the College Gameday site. They went to New Orleans on September 25, 2006 for the re-opening of the Louisiana Superdome when the New Orleans Saints returned home to play the Atlanta Falcons. The program also visited non-sports venues such as the Golden Globes and 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston and Republican Convention in New York (which was held at Madison Square Garden directly across from Cold Pizza's Manhattan studio). The show's coverage of the intersection of politics generated positive reviews and media attention for the program. Appearing on Capital Report on CNBC on July 21, Cold Pizza Executive Producer Brian Donlon said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a sports network and what we try to do is sit in the middle of the intersection of sports and sports lifestyles. If you look at the list of speakers, the list of delegates, some of the events, some of the parties -‚Äì there‚Äôs a Yankees-Red Sox game that kicks off the Democratic National Convention. The intersection of sports and politics is rich with stories and we‚Äôre going to be there to cover each and every one of them.‚Äù Guests on the show have included Senator John McCain, Senator John Edwards, Rep.Dick Gephardt, Hank Aaron, rock star Bob Seger, who also served as the show's NBA analyst during the 2004 NBA Finals which featured the rocker's hometown Detroit Pistons, Pete Rose, Dennis Rodman, Jos√© Canseco, Senator Tom Davis, Mike Krzyzewski, Nick Lachey, X-Play Co-Host Morgan Webb and even the man that caught Barry Bonds' 715th home run ball. On January 25, 2007 MediaWeek reported that ESPN would announce Cold Pizzas move from New York to the ESPN campus in Bristol, Connecticut. In addition to being able to cut costs and produce the program in high definition, the new locale allowed more live appearances by ESPN analysts (as opposed to satellite or telephone interviews). However, the move reduced the amount of live appearances by celebrities and non-sports figures. The official chronology shows that Cold Pizza ended on May 4, and was replaced by a new show, ESPN First Take, on May 7, though nearly all of the former show's features were incorporated into the new show. Format From the show's inception through 2005, its format was similar to traditional network television morning shows such as Good Morning America and The Today Show, featuring discussion among the hosts on entertainment and sports topics. After poor initial ratings, the format was changed to be similar to that of SportsCenter and Pardon the Interruption, including sports headlines, analysis, and debate. Because of the format change, hosts Hoover and Maxie were let go due to lack of a sports journalism background, and Jacobson, Paige, and Bayless joined. Co-host Andrews was transferred by ESPN to Los Angeles to co-host ESPN2's new evening entertainment news show, ESPN Hollywood. That show was cancelled in January 2006, and Andrews remained with ESPN until November 2006, when she left the company to work as a correspondent for Entertainment Tonight. The most recent format of the program featured the introduction graphic introducing the hosts and a show rundown. Following that was \\"The Top Story\\" of the sports world and an appropriate guest, followed by the \\"Morning Headlines,\\" which included about four or five news items from around sports. The headline segment was repeated at the top of the second hour. At 20 and 40 past the first and second hour, Crawford, Bayless and Paige (or a guest contributor after Paige's departure) were featured in segments entitled \\"1st and 10,\\" which were edited into a stand-alone show that aired later in the day. The \\"Morning Slice,\\" a look at offbeat sports video, was also part of the program.

That was discontinued early in the show's run. * Zach Leibowitz also contributed to the show at the halfway point when he mocked sideline reporters by grading Crawford and Hoover's performance in the first half of the show. This was also discontinued early on. * After ESPN Hollywood was cancelled, Thea Andrews briefly hosted a segment of the latest news of the convergence between the sports and entertainment worlds called Sports and Hollywood which began in April 2006. The tightened focus on sports news resulted in an end to that segment in November 2006; however, actors and other performers still stopped by the Cold Pizza studios from time to time to pitch their projects and share their love of sports. Controversy In February 2006, Texas Tech head basketball coach Bobby Knight was promoting a new reality show for ESPN entitled Knight School. Jacobson asked Knight at the end of the interview if he was interested in returning to his old coaching job at Indiana University. This made Knight angry, which ultimately led to him walking out of the interview. Jacobson was not at work the next day, but not because of the Knight incident; she had a planned vacation day, according to the network. Pre-emptions and cancellations * One day in October 2005, the entire show was not seen. Crawford explained that unspecified technical difficulties made the show impossible to produce that day. ESPNEWS was simulcast on ESPN2 instead. * Twice, Cold Pizzas rebroadcast has ended early due to breaking news: on September 27, 2006, due to conflicting reports as to whether Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Terrell Owens had attempted to commit suicide; and on November 17, 2006, when college football coach Bo Schembechler died from a heart attack. In both cases, SportsCenter was simulcast in the remainder of the scheduled time slot.  On the other hand, an altered, non- commercial version of the show was simulcast by ESPN on January 22, 2007 during the usual re-air slot, due to the resignation of Dallas Cowboys head coach Bill Parcells that was disclosed just before the end of the live show.

He was born in a small village Sveri near the mining town of Chiatura, Imereti (Western Georgia), into the family of a Georgian retired cavalry officer Artem Gvaladze (1862-1918). Gvaladze was a descendant of David II, King of imereti in 1784-1790. Having graduated from the Gymnasium at the Tbilisi State University in 1920, he joined the National Army of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in July, 1920 and took part in the battles against the invading Red and Turkish armies in Kojory-Tabakhmela (near Tbilisi) and Batumi in February‚ÄìMarch, 1921. On February 20, 1921 Gvaladze was decorated with the Military Cross of \\"Tetri Giorgi\\" (\\"White Giorgi\\"). After the Bolshevik takeover of the Georgian government, he was demobilized. In 1926 Gvaladze graduated from the Department of Law of the Social-Economic Faculty of the Tbilisi State University (TSU). Since April, 1921 he was involved in the underground activities of the Georgian Menshevik Party to which he was a member in 1917-1923. In 1926-1932 Gvaladze was a member of the Board of the Defending Lawyers of Georgia, and lectured at the Pedagogical Institute in Gori from 1935 to 1937. His articles were systematically published in the Georgian press of 1916-1928. In 1921-1932 Gvaladzes journalistic papers were published in the Georgian emigrant press also (\\"Tavisupali Sakartvelo\\", \\"Tetri Giorgi\\", etc. Pseudonyms: \\"G.\\", \\"Geno\\", etc.). In spite of continuing social activity under the Soviet government, he never abandoned his political positions and led, from 1926, the underground conspirative group of the Georgian national political organization Tetri Giorgi. Earlier, on May 26, 1922, on the fourth anniversary of the independence of Georgia, he was one of the organizers of the first mass anti-Soviet demonstration in Tbilisi and was arrested by the GPU. In 1923, he joined an underground anti-Bolshevik bloc of the Georgian political opposition known as the Committee for Independence of Georgia and represented it in the Kakheti district where he was involved in preparation of an armed rebellion in August, 1924. He was arrested on September 5, 1924, but was released due to a declared amnesty in March, 1925. On August 10, 1937, during the Great Purge, he was rearrested along with his associates from the \\"Tetri Giorgi\\" conspirative group and shot in Tbilisi on October 15, 1937.  References  * A.

Stadium seating capacity is 8,000 to 10,000, much of which is bench seating, while large berms surrounding the stadium provide additional seating allowing over 40,000 spectators. History Originally called Howard J. Lamade Memorial Field, the ballpark opened for the tournament. Howard J. Lamade was the son of Grit newspaper founder Dietrick Lamade. The younger Lamade was a vice president at Grit Publishing, and served on the board of directors for Little League Baseball in the 1950s. A donation from Grit Publishing was used to purchase land where the stadium is located. The ballpark received its current name in 1968, when the original wood and steel stands were replaced with a concrete stadium. =Renovations= The exterior of Lamade Stadium in 2007 Lights were added in 1992 to facilitate night game play in conjunction with expansion of the series to round robin play. In 2006, the fences were moved back to to all fields. This was done because home runs were becoming too common. Other renovations included the extension of the stadium roofs to the end of the grandstands, and some bleachers replaced with individual seats with backs, increasing seating of that type from approximately 600 to 1500. On August 19, , Lamade Stadium set an attendance record for the game between La Grange, Kentucky, and Clinton County, Pennsylvania, with 41,848 people in the stands and on the hill.

Early life Born Thomas Wade Vaughn on October 14, 1936, in Benton, Kentucky, he began his music study on the piano around the age of five under the tutelage of his mother, Elizabeth. The piano was the instrument of choice for their family. Robert Wade, an uncle, was employed as a pianist by the New York and San Francisco ballet companies. When he was 10 years old, his family, which also included four girls, relocated to Pontiac, Michigan,Stewart, Zan: \\"Jazz Is Minister's Other Calling\\" Los Angeles Times, December 5, 1996 near Detroit.Wharton, David: \\"Father Jazz\\", Los Angeles Times, September 1, 1991. During his adolescence, he studied classical music with Harold Deremier. At the age of 12, Vaughn experienced the genius of Art Tatum, who was visiting Deremier. Vaughn stated: \\"I hadn't been exposed to music like that before.\\" \\"That was amazing,\\" and shifted his focus to jazz. In his mid-teens he was jamming in Detroit with other young musicians including Kenny Burrell, Paul Chambers, and Elvin Jones. Vaughn graduated from Eureka College in Illinois with a degree in history while playing piano in area clubs. He and his sweetheart Beverle Jean were married, and the couple started a family when Sheila Denise was born in 1961. Two other children followed: Tom, Jr. in 1963; and Angela Suzanne in 1965. A strong interest in religion led him to enroll in Yale Divinity School, where he earned a doctorate in theology. He entered the Episcopal priesthood, and in 1964 his first position was assistant to the rector at St. John's Episcopal Church in Midland, Michigan, two hours north of Detroit. Vaughn still played concerts at colleges and clubs sporadically, but the 8am Sunday service limited his travel. That same year Father Tom sat in with Gene Krupa's quartet in Detroit, where he caught the attention of producer George Wein. Recording and playing One year later, Wein brought Vaughn to New York City, where he recorded Jazz In Concert At The Village Gate with Art Davis on double bass and Elvin Jones on drums. Vaughn was a featured performer at the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival, opening for Miles Davis. Father Vaughn left St. John's Church in Midland in 1967, deciding that Los Angeles would be more conducive to his two passions, music and the ministry. Cornbread (Meat Loaf, Greens & Devilled Eggs) was recorded and released, followed by Motor City Soul in 1968. He played in festivals and concerts during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and appeared on local television and national talk shows, including Johnny Carson, Steve Allen and Merv Griffin. All this was done around his church responsibilities. Settling down Vaughn joined St. Martin-in-the-Fields Episcopal Church in Winnetka, California in 1968. Three years later, he performed a jazz concert in the parish hall to raise funds for the \\"Fireside Room\\", then began serving as assistant rector. When St. Martin's celebrated their 25th anniversary with a big barbecue, music and dancing, Father Tom played during the 1974 festivities. He was installed as rector in 1976, the year he recorded his last album, Joyful Jazz. He stayed busy with the parish and raising his three children until 1984, when he needed hip replacement‚Äîboth‚Äîand retired from active ministry.St. Martin-in-the-Fields Church history After that, he served as a supply priest, officiating services at churches when the rector was absent.\\"Thomas Wade Vaughn Sr\\" Church Publishing Inc., clergyquickfind Retirement Father Tom Vaughn reappeared publicly in 1990, conducting the memorial service for singer June Christy at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills). As part of the service, he invited a quartet of eminent musicians to play in her honor, but did not join the group himself, instead opting to listen and enjoy the music as a spectator.Father Tom Vaughn's involvement during the June Christy memorial service By the early 1990s, his children were grown and Vaughn played at local clubs a few times each year; a 1990 performance at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel received positive reviews. He also hosted a public-access television cable show, \\"All That Jazz\\", and was considering a return to the recording studio. Vaughn was interviewed by the Los Angeles Times in 1991 and asked why he chose to remain a priest rather than accept fame and fortune as a touring musician. > Nothing can move me at the deepest spiritual level like music can, (but) > music was never completely satisfying. Music was something that came to me > as a pure gift. Maybe it came too easily. The clergy came to me through hard > work and learning. I felt called to the inquiries of the mind. Tom Vaughn > didn't want musical notoriety. I've never made much of a fuss over it > myself. After turning 60, Vaughn further reduced his public performances to perhaps once a year. He remained married to wife, Bev, and practiced for three or four hours most mornings for his own enjoyment. > That feeling, when it's right, there's nothing better ‚Äì carnality, food, > throw it all out the window. When I get in a groove, I'm detached, almost > like losing consciousness, like flying some sort of super aircraft. It's > close to an out-of-body experience. At an interview in 1996, he acknowledged splitting piano time between playing the classics (Bach, Beethoven & Chopin) and improvising jazz with touches of blues and bebop. Vaughn died March 4, 2011, according to comments posted on a YouTube video of Vaughn's recording of \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\".

She attended Howard University with a scholarship from 1953 to 1955, leaving to study at the State University of New York at Fredonia (near Buffalo).Hilary Holladay, 73 Poems for 73 Years, James Madison University, September 21, 2010, p. 48. In 1958, Lucille Sayles married Fred James Clifton, a professor of philosophy at the University at Buffalo, and a sculptor whose carvings depicted African faces. Lucille and her husband had six children together, which included four daughters (Sidney, Fredrica, Gillian, and Alexia) and two sons (Channing and Graham). Lucille worked as a claims clerk in the New York State Division of Employment, Buffalo (1958‚Äì60), and as literature assistant in the Office of Education in Washington, D.C. (1960‚Äì71). Writer Ishmael Reed introduced Lucille to Clifton while he was organizing the Buffalo Community Drama Workshop. Fred and Lucille Clifton starred in the group's version of The Glass Menagerie, which was called \\"poetic and sensitive\\" by the Buffalo Evening News. In 1966, Reed took some of Clifton's poems to Langston Hughes, who included them in his anthology The Poetry of the Negro. In 1967, the Cliftons moved to Baltimore, Maryland. Her first poetry collection, Good Times, was published in 1969, and listed by The New York Times as one of the year's ten best books. From 1971 to 1974, Clifton was poet-in-residence at Coppin State College in Baltimore. From 1979 to 1985, she was Poet Laureate of the state of Maryland.\\"Maryland Poets Laureate\\", webpage of Maryland State Archives, retrieved May 27, 2007. From 1982 to 1983, she was visiting writer at the Columbia University School of the Arts and at George Washington University. In 1984, her husband died of cancer. From 1985 to 1989, Clifton was a professor of literature and creative writing at the University of California, Santa Cruz.Maryland State Archives and Maryland Commission for Women. \\"Lucille Clifton\\", Maryland Women's Hall of Fame, retrieved May 28, 2007. She was Distinguished Professor of Humanities at St. Mary's College of Maryland. From 1995 to 1999, she was a visiting professor at Columbia University. In 2006, she was a fellow at Dartmouth College. She died in Baltimore on February 13, 2010. Poetic work Plaque outside the New York Public Library Lucille Clifton traced her family's roots to the West African Kingdom of Dahomey, now the Republic of Benin. Growing up she was told by her mother, \\"Be proud, you're from Dahomey women!\\"Lupton (2006), p. 60. She cites as one of her ancestors the first black woman to be \\"legally hanged\\" for manslaughter in the state of Kentucky during the time of Slavery in the United States. Girls in her family are born with an extra finger on each hand, a genetic trait known as polydactyly. Lucille's two extra fingers were amputated surgically when she was a small child, a common practice at that time for reasons of superstition and social stigma. Her \\"two ghost fingers\\" and their activities became a theme in her poetry and other writings. Health problems in her later years included painful gout which gave her some difficulty in walking. Her series of children's books about a young black boy began with 1970's Some of the Days of Everett Anderson. Everett Anderson, a recurring character in many of her books, spoke in African American English and dealt with real life social problems. Her work features in anthologies such as My Black Me: A Beginning Book of Black Poetry (ed. Arnold Adoff), A Poem of Her Own: Voices of American Women Yesterday and Today (ed. Catherine Clinton), Black Stars: African American Women Writers (ed. Brenda Scott Wilkinson), Daughters of Africa (ed. Margaret Busby), and Bedrock: Writers on the Wonders of Geology (eds Lauret E. Savoy, Eldridge M. Moores, and Judith E. Moores (Trinity University Press). Studies about Clifton's life and writings include Wild Blessings: The Poetry of Lucille Clifton (LSU Press, 2004) by Hilary Holladay, and Lucille Clifton: Her Life and Letters (Praeger, 2006) by Mary Jane Lupton. = Two-Headed Woman: \\"homage to my hips\\" = In 1980 Clifton published \\"homage to my hips\\" in her book of poems, Two-Headed Woman. Two- Headed Woman won the 1980 Juniper Prize and was characterized by its \\"dramatic tautness, simple language ‚Ä¶ tributes to blackness, [and] celebrations of women\\", which are all traits reflected in the poem \\"homage to my hips\\".Jessie Carney Smith, Notable Black American Women, Book 2 (Detroit, MI: Gale Research Inc., 1996), 110. This particular collection of poetry also marks the beginning of Clifton's interest in depicting the \\"transgressive black body.\\"Michael Bennett, Vanessa D. Dickerson, Recovering the Black Female Body: Self-representations by African American Women (New Brunswick, New Jersey, and London: Rutgers University Press, 2001), 127. \\"homage to my hips\\" was preceded by the poem \\"homage to my hair\\" ‚Äì and acts as a complementary work that explores the relationship between African-American women and men and aimed to reinvent the negative stereotypes associated with the black female body. \\"Homage to my hips\\" and \\"homage to my hair\\" both relate the African-American body to mythological powers ‚Äì a literary technique common among many literary works by African American women. Jane Campbell poses the idea that \\"the specific effect of mythmaking upon race relations ‚Ä¶ constitutes a radical act, inviting the audience to subvert the racist mythology that thwarts and defeats Afro-Americans, and to replace it with a new mythology rooted in the black perspective.\\"Bennett & Dickerson, Recovering the Black Female Body (2001), 126. Therefore, Clifton utilizes \\"homage to my hips\\" to celebrate the African- American female body as a source of power, sexuality, pride, and freedom. Awards Lucille Clifton received a Creative Writing Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1970 and 1973, and a grant from the Academy of American Poets. She received the Charity Randall prize, the Jerome J. Shestack Prize from the American Poetry Review, and an Emmy Award. Her children's book Everett Anderson's Good-bye won the 1984 Coretta Scott King Award. In 1988, Clifton became the first author to have two books of poetry named finalists for one year's Pulitzer Prize. (The award dates from 1918, the announcement of finalists from 1980.)

From 1999 to 2005, she served on the Board of Chancellors of the Academy of American Poets.

Powered by advanced science, will the darkness of fascism spread across the world, or can brave men and women prevent it?\\" Rules Gear Krieg is based on the Silhouette game engine, a streamlined set of rules that is already described in Heavy Gear, Dream Pod 9's other science fiction game. It can be played as either a role-playing game (RPG), a tactical wargame, or an hybrid integration of both. Both the RPG and miniature games are built on the same basic rule mechanics. Silhouette is a realistic, simulationist system that defines characters in terms of ten base attributes (agility, knowledge, etc.), 5 derived attributes (health, etc.), and a variety of skills. Skill rolls make up the backbone of the system, which focuses on effect-based speed of play over grainy detail. The core mechanic involves rolling a number of 6-sided dice, taking the highest result and comparing it to a set threshold number. If the result is higher than the threshold the test is a success; if it is lower the test is a failure. The margin by which the test succeeded (Margin of Success, MoS) or failed (Margin of Failure, MoF) helps to determine the final outcome. Combat is handled by the same system, with characters taking penalty-inflicting wounds rather than depleting a set number of health points. As a result, the system can be lethal, especially on inexperienced characters. To keep the proper pulp high-action atmosphere, the game includes rules that allow players to twist the odds in their favor, in keeping with the conventions of the adventure genre. Publication history Just as its support for Tribe 8 was starting to fade, Dream Pod 9 came out with their fourth RPG, Gear Krieg (2001), an alternate-history role-playing game set during World War II where technology was more advanced and thus the game featured technological anachronisms such as walking tanks. Like the company's earlier game Heavy Gear, Gear Krieg could be played either as a role-playing game or a tactical one. The Silhouette CORE Rulebook (2003) offered a new standalone version of Silhouette that turned it into a generic system and also contained rules for converting d20 to Silhouette. The 'SilCORE' book ‚Äì as it was called ‚Äì was immediately followed by the Mecha Companion (2003), which offered d20 stats for all the mecha from Heavy Gear, Jovian Chronicles and Gear Krieg using Guardians of Order's d20 Mecha (2003) mech description rules. The creation of the SilCORE book also allowed Dream Pod 9 to rerelease old games in dual d20 and Silhouette form, and the next year thus saw the release of Jovian Chronicles second edition (2003), Gear Krieg second edition (2003), Heavy Gear third edition (2003), Tribe 8 second edition (2004) and the brand new CORE Command (2003).

Although there is very little information about Yan Yan in historical records, he is given a much prominent role in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms as a general who initially serves under Liu Zhang before switching allegiance to Liu Bei later. Life Yan Yan was from Linjiang County (Ëá®Ê±üÁ∏£), Ba Commandery (Â∑¥ÈÉ°), which is around present-day Zhong County, Chongqing. He served as a military officer in Ba Commandery under Liu Zhang, the Governor of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing); Ba Commandery was one of the commanderies in Yi Province. In 211, Liu Zhang invited the warlord Liu Bei to lead his troops into Yi Province to help him counter the threat posed by his rival, Zhang Lu, in Hanzhong Commandery.

Around 212, conflict broke out between Liu Zhang and Liu Bei when the latter turned against his host and tried to seize control of Yi Province. In 214, Liu Bei summoned reinforcements from his base in Jing Province to enter Yi Province and assist him in attacking Liu Zhang. Zhang Fei, a general under Liu Bei, led troops to attack Jiangzhou (Ê±üÂ∑û; around present-day Yuzhong District, Chongqing), which was defended by Yan Yan. Zhang Fei defeated Yan Yan, captured him alive, and asked him: \\"When my army showed up, why did you put up resistance instead of surrendering?\\" Yan Yan replied: \\"You people launched an unwarranted attack on my home province. There may be generals in my province who will lose their heads, but there are none who will surrender.\\" Zhang Fei was enraged and he ordered Yan Yan's execution. Yan Yan remained expressionless and said: \\"If you want to chop off my head, then do it!

Nothing was recorded in history about Yan Yan from this point onwards. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Yan Yan has a greater role as a character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In Chapter 63 of the novel, as in history, he is defeated and captured by Zhang Fei, who initially wants to execute him but changes his mind and spares him after feeling impressed with Yan Yan's strong sense of loyalty. Zhang Fei also manages to convince Yan Yan to switch his allegiance to Liu Bei.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 63.

Its properties were first recorded in 1970 by Drs. Brown and Goldstein, with the defining property being the ability to bind and remove modified low density lipoproteins (LDL). Today scavenger receptors are known to be involved in a wide range of processes, such as: homeostasis, apoptosis, inflammatory diseases and pathogen clearance. Scavenger receptors are mainly found on myeloid cells and other cells that bind to numerous ligands, primarily endogenous and modified host-molecules together with pathogen- associated molecular patterns(PAMPs), and remove them. The Kupffer cells in the liver are particularly rich in scavenger receptors, includes SR-A I, SR-A II, and MARCO.  Function  The scavenger receptor superfamily is defined by its ability to recognize and bind a broad range of common ligands. These ligands include: polyanionic ligands including lipoproteins, apoptotic cells, cholesterol ester, phospholipids, proteoglycans, ferritin, and carbohydrates. This broad recognition range allows scavenger receptors to play an important role in homeostasis and the combating of diseases. This is accomplished via the recognition of various PAMP's and DAMP's, which leads to the removal or scavenging of pathogens with the recognition of PAMP's and the removal of apoptotic cells, self reactive antigens and the products of oxidative stress. In atherosclerotic lesions, macrophages that express scavenger receptors on their plasma membrane take up the oxidized LDL deposited in the blood vessel wall aggressively, and develop into foam cells. Likewise, they secrete various inflammatory cytokines and accelerate the development of atherosclerosis.  Types  Schematic collection of the scavenger receptor superfamily. Classes A-J are displayed with their respective domains. All classes have a mammalian orthologue, with the exception of C. Scavenger receptors are incredibly diverse and therefore they organized into many different classes, starting at A and continuing to L. This organization is based on their structural properties. Due to the diversity and ongoing research into scavenger receptors, the receptors lack an accepted nomenclature and they have been described under different names. In 2014 a new nomenclature has been proposed which has been used by some researchers, although no official recognition has been given. * Class A is mainly expressed in the macrophage, and a protein whose molecular weight is about 80 kDa makes a trimer; it is composed of 1) cytosol domain, 2) transmembrane domain, 3) spacer domain, 4) alpha-helical coiled-coil domain, 5) collagen-like domain, and 6) cysteine-rich domain. * Class B has two transmembrane regions. * Class C is a transmembrane protein whose N-terminus is located extracellularly. = Class A = Class A receptors are a type II membrane protein who use their collagen-like domain for ligand binding. Members include:Scavenger receptors type 1 (SR-A1) is a trimer with a molecular weight of about 220-250 kDa (the molecular weight of monomeric protein is about 80 kDa). It preferentially bind modified LDL, either acylated (acLDL) or oxidized (oxLDL). Other ligands include: binds to Œ≤-amyloid, heat shock proteins, surface molecules of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, hepatitis C virus. SR-A1 can be alternatively spliced which contains a reduced C-terminus, it is contained within the Endoplasmatic Reticulum and just like the unspliced version has a strong affinity for polyanionic ligand binding. * SCARA1 or MSR1: SR-A1 besides macrophages they can also be found on the smooth vascular muscle cells and endothelial tissues, oxidative stress enhances their presence on the endothelium. * SCARA2 or MARCO: SR-A6, only found on macrophages in the peritoneum, lymph nodes, liver and specific zones of the spleen. Bacteria and lipopolysaccharide produced by bacteria stimulate its expression, SR-A6 is unable to connect with modiefied LDL. *SCARA3, MSRL1 or APC7: SR-A3 plays an significant role in the protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS). * SCARA4 or COLEC12: SR-A4 acts as a receptor for the detection, engulfment and destruction of oxidatively modified LDL for vascular endothelial cells. *SCARA5 or TESR: SR-A5 located in a diverse set of tissues, such as: lung placenta, intestine, heart and epithelial cells, and has a high affinity for bacteria but not for modified LDL. = Class B = CD36 and scavenger receptor class BI are identified as genes encoding for oxidized LDL receptors and classified into scavenger receptor B (SR-B). Both proteins have two transmembrane domains with an extracellular loop, and they are concentrated in a specific plasma membrane microdomain, the caveolae. Members include: * SCARB1 or CD36L1: SR-B1 can interact not only with oxidized LDL but also with normal LDL and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). And plays an important role in their transportation into the cells. Recent studies have indicated that SR-BI is likely to be the major receptor involved in HDL metabolism in mice and humans. Besides LDL and HDL SR-B1 binds to viruses, bacteria. SR-B1 is located on the hepatocytes, steroidogenic cells, arterial wall and macrophages.Mutations in SR-B1 have a negative effect on fertility, the innate immune response and leads to an increase in antherosclerosis. * SCARB2 * SCARB3 or CD36: SR-B2 has been thought to be implicated in cell adhesion, developmement of blood vessels, in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, and in the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. Furtheremore it has been shown that CD36 is heavily involved with macrophage migration and signalling, together with protecting the hoast against, bacteria, fungi and malaria parasites. In experimental mice models of atherosclerosis in which the gene for CD36 has been deleted, the mice have a greatly reduced number of atherosclerotic lesions. CD36 can be found in many different cells, for example: insulin-responsive cells, hematopoietic cells like platelets, monocytes, and macrophages, endothelial cells, and specialized epithelial cells in the breast and eye. = Other = Some receptors that can bind to oxidized LDL have been discovered. * CD68 and its mouse homologue, macrosialin, has a unique N-terminal mucin-like domain. * Mucin is a viscous substance (found in natt≈ç or okra) that is composed of a protein and polysaccharides binding it. A Drosophila class C scavenger receptor (dSR-C1) also has a mucin-like structure. * Lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) was isolated from an aortic endothelial cell, and recently it has been discovered in macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells in artery vessels. The expression of LOX-1 is inducted by inflammatory stimuli, so LOX-1 is thought to be involved in the development of atherosclerotic lesions.

Again is a 1996 film directed by Adam Grossman and starring Michael Gross, Alexis Arquette, and Hilary Swank. It is the straight- to-video sequel to the 1991 horror film Sometimes They Come Back.  Plot  Psychologist Jon Porter (Michael Gross) learns that his mother has just mysteriously fallen to her death. Jon and his teenage daughter Michelle (Hilary Swank) return to Jon's hometown of Glenrock for his mother's funeral. Once there, painful memories return. Thirty years earlier, when Jon was a child, he witnessed the brutal murder of his older sister Lisa (Leslie Danon), who was stabbed to death in a cave by a thug named Tony Reno (Alexis Arquette) and his two friends Vinnie (Bojesse Christopher) and Sean (Glen Beaudin). But Jon managed to throw an electrical wire into a puddle of bloody water they were standing in, killing all three of them. Michelle becomes friends with mentally handicapped gardener Steve (Gabriel Dell Jr.), as well as two girls, boy-crazy Maria (Jennifer Aspen), and Maria's psychic best friend, Jules (Jennifer Elise Cox), who used to clean her grandmother's house. The night after the funeral, they invite Michelle to go to the dinner with them, saying they would like to get to know her before she goes home for her 18th birthday. At the dinner, the girls are greeted by a boy who looks a lot like Tony Reno, even with the same name. While Maria develops a crush on him, he seems to be attracted to Michelle. He gives Michelle an old wristwatch as an early birthday present, then leaves. Meanwhile, Jon is pestered by Father Archer Roberts (W. Morgan Sheppard), a priest he came to when Lisa was murdered. He tells Jon his mother's death was not an accident. In the end, Jon reenacts the events of the murder of Lisa but saves Michelle and is able to use a ritual given to him by Father Roberts to banish Tony and his friends back to Hell.

In the Australian court hierarchy, the Supreme Court of Tasmania is in the middle level, with both an appellate jurisdiction over lower courts, and decisions made by Court to be heard on appeal by the High Court of Australia. The ordinary sittings of the Court occur in Hobart, Launceston and Burnie in Tasmania. The Court's Appeal division sits only in Hobart. History of the Court The Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land (as Tasmania was then known) was established by The Royal Letters Patent of 13 October 1823 and commenced activities on 10 May 1824.Supreme Court History ‚Äì Charter of Justice, Supreme Court of Tasmania The Court is the oldest Supreme Court in Australia and predates the Supreme Court of New South Wales, if only by a period of just ten days. The supreme courts of Tasmania and New South Wales were initiated through the New South Wales Act 1823, and this gave those courts jurisdiction over New Zealand. Sir John Pedder, after whom Lake Pedder is named, was the first Chief Justice of the court. The first counsel to appear before the Court was Joseph Tice Gellibrand, who was appointed Tasmania's first Attorney- General, and took his oaths on the first day of the new Court. The first case before the Court was the trial of William Tibbs, who was found guilty and sentenced for manslaughter, receiving 3 years transportation.. Jurisdiction of the Court It has unlimited jurisdiction within the state in civil matters and hears the most serious criminal matters. It is around the middle of the Australian court hierarchy. The Supreme Court consists of a Trial Division (also known as Original Jurisdiction) and an Appeal Division (or Appellate Jurisdiction).Supreme Court ‚Äì Jurisdiction, Supreme Court of Tasmania When sitting in its appellate jurisdiction in civil matters it is the \\"Full Court\\"; for criminal matters it is the \\"Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal\\". Appeals from the Appeal Division of the Court are to the High Court of Australia. It was previously possible to appeal decisions of the Court of Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeal (both parts of the Appeal Division) to the British Privy Council, but this ceased in 1986 when the Parliament of Australia passed the Australia Act 1986, which barred all such appeals to the Privy Council from Australian courts. Civil matters involving consent orders, or for disputes involving less than $50,000, are dealt with by the Magistrates Court except in exceptional circumstances. The Court receives appeals from Magistrate Courts in Tasmania in both criminal and civil matters. Committal proceedings, which are used in criminal matters to establish whether there is sufficient evidence against an accused person to warrant the time and expense of a trial, were abolished in Tasmania in 2000 with the amendment of the Justices Act 1959 (Tas). The Justices Act 1959 now provides that where there has been a plea of not guilty by an accused, there must be an order committing them for trial in the Supreme Court. Unlike some other Australian states, Tasmania does not have an intermediate court division between the Supreme Court and the Magistrates Courts (such as a \\"District Court\\" or a \\"County Court\\").Annual Report 2007‚Äì2008, page 23, Supreme Court of Tasmania Composition of the Court The Supreme Court of Tasmania is composed of up to seven judges appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Executive Council, a body of senior ministers including the state Premier. the judges of the Supreme Court of Tasmania are: The Associate Judge, a lower-ranking judicial officer previously called the Master, has responsibility for largely procedural matters in civil and criminal proceedings, and for some work in assessing the damages (amounts claimable) in civil proceedings.

During his lifetime in Ethiopia, he was commonly called \\"Marqorewos\\". Evidence of his life before arriving in Ethiopia has not been found, according to Paul B. Henze.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 80. E. A. Wallis Budge, in his preface to the second edition of his translation of the Kebra Nagast, claims that Brancaleon was a monk who had come to Ethiopia to convert Emperor Zara Yaqob and debated Abba Giyorgis several times on religious matters;E.A. Wallis Budge, The Queen of Sheba and Her Only Son Menyelek (I) or, The Kebra Nagast, second edition (London: 1932) (Wallis Budge may have misremembered James Bruce's statement about Abba Giyorgis's opponent in that religious debate, \\"We are not informed of the name of Abba George's antagonist, but he is thought to have been a Venetian painter, who lived many years after in Abyssinia, and, it is believed, died there\\"‚Äîexplicitly identifying him as Brancaleon in a footnote.James Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile (1805 edition), vol. 3, p. 100) Francisco √Ålvares, who met Brancaleon while accompanying the Portuguese ambassador on his mission to Lebna Dengel in the 1520s, wrote that \\"they say he was a monk before he came to this country\\".Francisco Alvarez, The Prester John of the Indies translated by C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford (Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1961), p. 313. Brancaleon arrived in Ethiopia between 1480 and 1482, according to an account of Francesco Suriano, who had visited the country, written in the latter year. When he arrived at the court of the Emperor (who was at the time encamped at Barar, which O.G.S. Crawford located to the southwest of modern Addis Ababa), Suriano found 14 Europeans residing at the court, among whom was \\"Master Nicolo Branchalion\\".O.G.S. Crawford, Ethiopian Itineraries, circa 1400-1524 (Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1958), pp. 40-54. By the time √Ålvares met Brancaleon, the painter was very wealthy and well known in Ethiopia  although forbidden by the Emperor to ever leave the country. By this time, he had founded a studio and was unchallenged in his skill at painting icons, illustrating books, and decorating churches. \\"Brancaleon's images of the martyrdom of Saint George and of the miracles of the Virgin Mary remained fashionable until the eighteenth century.\\"Jacques Mercier, \\"Ethiopian Art History\\" in Ethiopian Art: The Walters Museum (London: Third Millennium, 2001), p. 56 His best known work was a painting of the Madonna and Child that decorated the church of Atronsa Maryam, which caused much controversy. Beckingham and Huntingford, in their notes to their translation of √Ålvares account, repeat the account from the Paris Chronicle that Brancaleon's work :gave great offense to the Ethiopians because the Child was held in His Mother's left arm, the left being considered to be of lower status than the right. (But there are many Ethiopian pictures in which the Child is carried in the left arm, and it may be that in this case He was really shown in the right arm, which seen from the front might be described as the \\"left\\".)Alvarez, Prester John, p. 332 n.2 The painting, however, survived for several centuries until it was destroyed in 1704, along with the church, by an Oromo raid. In 1973, the traveller Diana Spencer discovered some examples of Brancaleon's works at Wafa Yesus and at the nearby monastery of Getisamani in the Goncha Gorge, including a work by a previously unknown Ethiopian apprentice. Henze reports that he and Stanislaw Chojnacki verified that these works survived the Derg era. \\"Though much has been learned about Ethiopian religious art in recent decades, it is still a challenging field where important new discoveries are likely to be made.\\"  References  Category:Ethiopian painters Category:15th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:16th-century Italian painters Category:Renaissance painters Category:Year of death unknown Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1460 births ","title":"Nicol√≤ Brancaleon"},{"id":"1961624","text":"The interleukin 4 (IL4, IL-4) is a cytokine that induces differentiation of naive helper T cells (Th0 cells) to Th2 cells. Upon activation by IL-4, Th2 cells subsequently produce additional IL-4 in a positive feedback loop. The cell that initially produces IL-4, thus inducing Th2 differentiation, has not been identified, but recent studies suggest that basophils may be the effector cell. It is closely related and has functions similar to interleukin 13.  Function  Interleukin 4 has many biological roles, including the stimulation of activated B-cell and T-cell proliferation, and the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. It is a key regulator in humoral and adaptive immunity. IL-4 induces B-cell class switching to IgE, and up-regulates MHC class II production. IL-4 decreases the production of Th1 cells, macrophages, IFN-gamma, and dendritic cell IL-12. Overproduction of IL-4 is associated with allergies. = Inflammation and wound repair = Tissue macrophages play an important role in chronic inflammation and wound repair. The presence of IL-4 in extravascular tissues promotes alternative activation of macrophages into M2 cells and inhibits classical activation of macrophages into M1 cells. An increase in repair macrophages (M2) is coupled with secretion of IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤ that result in a diminution of pathological inflammation. Release of arginase, proline, polyaminases and TGF-Œ≤ by the activated M2 cell is tied with wound repair and fibrosis.  Receptor  The receptor for interleukin-4 is known as the IL-4RŒ±. This receptor exists in 3 different complexes throughout the body. Type 1 receptors are composed of the IL-4RŒ± subunit with a common Œ≥ chain and specifically bind IL-4. Type 2 receptors consist of an IL-4RŒ± subunit bound to a different subunit known as IL-13RŒ±1. These type 2 receptors have the ability to bind both IL-4 and IL-13, two cytokines with closely related biological functions.  Structure  IL-4 has a compact, globular fold (similar to other cytokines), stabilised by 3 disulphide bonds. One half of the structure is dominated by a 4 alpha-helix bundle with a left- handed twist. The helices are anti-parallel, with 2 overhand connections, which fall into a 2-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet.  Discovery  This cytokine was co-discovered by Maureen Howard and William E. Paul as well as by Ellen Vitetta and her research group in 1982. The nucleotide sequence for human IL-4 was isolated four years later confirming its similarity to a mouse protein called B-cell stimulatory factor-1 (BCSF-1).  Animal studies  IL-4 has been found to mediate a crosstalk between the neural stem cells and neurons that undergo neurodegeneration, and initiate a regeneration cascade through phosphorylation of its intracellular effector STAT6 in an experimental Alzheimer's disease model in adult zebrafish brain.  Clinical significance  IL-4 has also been shown to drive mitogenesis, dedifferentiation, and metastasis in rhabdomyosarcoma. IL-4, along with other Th2 cytokines, is involved in the airway inflammation observed in the lungs of patients with allergic asthma.  Illnesses associated with IL-4  IL-4 plays an important role in the development of certain immune disorders, particularly allergies and some autoimmune diseases. =Allergic diseases= Allergic diseases are sets of disorders that are manifested by a disproportionate response of the immune system to the allergen and Th2 responses. These pathologies include, for example, atopic dermatitis, asthma, or systemic anaphylaxis. Interleukin 4 mediates important pro-inflammatory functions in asthma, including induction of isotype rearrangement of IgE, expression of VCAM-1 molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), promoting eosinophilic transmigration through endothelium, mucus secretion and T helper type 2 (Th2) leading to cytokine release. Asthma is a complex genetic disorder that has been associated with IL-4 gene promoter polymorphism and proteins involved in IL-4 signaling. =Tumors= IL-4 has a significant effect on tumor progression. Increased IL-4 production was found in breast, prostate, lung, renal cells and other types of cancer. Many overexpression of IL-4R has been found in many types of cancer. Renal cells and glioblastoma modify 10,000-13,000 receptors per cell depending on tumor type. IL-4 can primitively motivate tumor cells and increase their apoptosis resistance by increasing tumor growth. =Nervous system= Brain tissue tumors such as astrocytoma, glioblastoma, meningioma, and medulloblastoma overexpress receptors for various growth factors including epidermal growth factor receptor, FGFR-1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1), TfR angiotensin transferrin receptor), IL-13R. Most human meningiomas massively expresses IL-4 receptors, indicating its role in cancer progression. They express IL-4RŒ± and IL13RŒ±-1-1, but not the surface Œ≥c chain, suggesting that most human meningiomas express IL-4 type II. =HIV= IL-4 may also play a role in the infection and development of HIV disease. Auxiliary T-lymphocytes are a key element of HIV-1 infection. Several signs of immune dysregulation such as polyclonal B-cell initialization, previous cell-mediated antigen-induced response and hypergammaglobulinaemia occur in most HIV-1 infected patients and are associated with cytokines synthesized by Th2 cells. Increased IL-4 production by Th2 cells has been demonstrated in people infected with HIV.

The Man, commonly known as the Nanman or Southern Man (), or the Southern Barbarians, were ancient indigenous peoples who lived in inland South and Southwest China, mainly around the Yangtze River valley. The Nanman included multiple ethnic groups, probably related to the predecessors of the modern Miao, Zhuang, and Dai peoples, and non-Chinese Sino-Tibetan groups such as the Yi people. There was never a single polity that united these people, although the state of Chu ruled over much of the Yangtze region during the Zhou dynasty and was heavily influenced by the Man culture.

During the Spring and Autumn period, King Wu of Chu (r. 741-690 BC) undertook many campaigns against the Man, who rebelled during the reign of King Zhuang of Chu (r. 613‚Äì591 BC). During the reign of King Dao of Chu, the general Wu Qi also conducted campaigns against the Man. When the state of Qin conquered Chu, they found that the commandery of Qianzhong, corresponding to modern Hubei and Hunan, was still inhabited by Man people. Under the Han dynasty, the Man were recognized as three distinct groups: the Pangu, Linjun, and Bandun. The Pangu worshiped dog totems and lived in the commanderies of Wuling and Changsha. They were also known as the Man of the Five Creeks. The Pangu had no unified leader but individual chiefs were acknowledged as local administrators by the Han. They wore clothes weaved from tree bark, used dotted patterns for their robes, wore short skirts, and painted their legs red. The Linjun lived further west in the commanderies of Ba and Nan, around modern Chongqing. Linjun was actually the name of a chief, who according to Linjun mythology, turned into a white tiger upon his death. Thus the Linjun worshiped the tiger. The Bandun Man (literally \\"board shield\\" barbarians) lived further west of the Linjun and were known for their music and heroic conduct in war. They supported Liu Bang after the fall of the Qin dynasty and contributed troops to Han campaigns against the Qiang people. According to legend, they killed a white tiger during the reign of King Zhaoxiang of Qin (r. 306‚Äì251 BC) and were therefore spared from taxes. The Bandun Man rebelled in 179 due to unrest caused by the Yellow Turban Rebellion, but when amnesty was issued by Cao Qian in 182, the rebellion was ended. There was another brief uprising in 188 which amounted to nothing. Related to the Bandun were the neighboring Zong people, who became interested in the mysticism of the Celestial Master Zhang Lu and moved north to the border of his territory. When Cao Cao attacked Zhang Lu in the summer of 215, he fled to Duhu of the Zong and Fuhu of the Bandun for refuge. However Duhu and Fuhu surrendered to Cao Cao in the autumn and received appointment, with Zhang Lu following in the winter. The Bandun and Zong were settled in what is now modern Gansu province. In 219 Liu Bei's officer Huang Quan attacked them and drove several non-Chinese peoples north into Cao Cao's territory. The Zong therefore became known as the Di people from Ba. These Di people later founded the state of Cheng Han, one of the Sixteen Kingdoms. In southwest China, the Nanman tribes rebelled after the death of Shu Han's founder, Liu Bei, in 223.The Shu Han chancellor, Zhuge Liang, led a successful expedition to quell the rebellion in 225. One of the leaders of the Nanman, Meng Huo, was captured seven times before he surrendered. After the fall of the Han dynasty, the Man became more integrated into Han Chinese society. During the period of Northern and Southern dynasties, the Man were able to remain independent by switching sides out of political expedience. The southern courts appointed Man chiefs as tax collectors for their regions. Many Man chiefs taxed their subjects lightly which resulted in some Han Chinese pretending to be Man people. On one occasion, a Han Chinese called Huan Dan even became a Man chieftain. The Man also rebelled at times. Defeated tribes were resettled at border garrisons or became slaves in the metropolitan area. Generally speaking, the trend was for the Nanman to migrate ever northward. By the 7th century the ethnic character of Man society was decidedly mixed, resulting in what is now the modern population of Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Henan. Culture The Nanman \\"Southern Man\\" tattooed their foreheads and were a totem worshiping people. Among their totems were those dedicated to tiger, snake, and dog deities. Romance of the Three Kingdoms Meng Huo was a local leader of the Nanman, or simply a Han Chinese with great influence among them, mentioned in Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms by Pei Songzhi. In 225, Meng Huo rebelled with Yong Kai against Shu Han. He was captured by Zhuge Liang seven times before he surrendered. =Meng Huo= Meng Huo riding into battle on his red ox Meng Huo's role was greatly expanded upon in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in which he is portrayed as the king of the Man and husband to Lady Zhurong, a descendant of the God of Fire. In the Romance, Meng Huo was described riding a red horse, wearing a golden inlaid headdress, a belt with a clasp in the image of a lion's face, boots with pointed toes that were green, and a pair of swords chased with pine amber at his waist. Later he rode into battle on a red ox, wearing rhinoceros armour while wielding sword and shield. He enlisted the aid of his fellow kings Wutugu, who commanded an army of 30,000 invincible rattan armour troops, and Mulu, who rode a white elephant and deployed wild beasts in battle. Although his allies were defeated by Zhuge Liang's anachronistic gunpowder weapons and killed, Meng Huo was repeatedly captured and released until he surrendered and became a local administrator. =Zhurong= Lady Zhurong was the wife of Meng Huo in the Romance. Adept at using throwing knives. She fought on the front line and defeated Zhao Yun (twice) and Wei Yan. She was captured in an ambush in a narrow valley where her horse was tripped by cords while in pursuit of Wei Yan. =Mulu= In the Romance, Mulu was the King of the Bana Ravine and aided Meng Huo in his fight against Zhuge Liang. =Wutugu= In the Romance, Wutugu was the King of Wuguo and aided Meng Huo in his fight against Zhuge Liang. =Duosi= In the Romance, Duosi was the king of a valley called the 'Bald Dragon Ravine'. He gave refuge to Meng Huo and aided him in his fight against Zhuge Liang. The valley Duosi ruled was only accessible by two roads, one which was suitable for human travel, and the other which was high, narrow, and infested by scorpions and snakes. The valley was home to four poisonous springs that made the region uninhabitable to birds or insects. The first spring was called the Dumb Spring which tasted well but made people dumb and die in a few days. The second spring was the Destruction Spring which was hot and made the flesh of those who bathed in it rot and die. The third spring was called the Black Spring, which had clear water, but turned black the limbs of those it touched and made them die. The fourth spring was called the Weak Spring, which was cold and chilled the breath of those who drank from it, made them weak and die. Modern China The She people and Yao people are said to be descended from the Man.

John Ostrander and Timothy Truman are credited as co-creators of the character, although Ostrander had been developing Grimjack with artist Lenin Delsol before Truman's arrival on the project according to Ostrander's own text piece in Grimjack #75. In that same essay, the writer also revealed having initially conceived the character to be the star of a series of prose stories, set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago. Grimjack is the street name of John Gaunt, a sword-for-hire, ex-paramilitary, war veteran and former child gladiator. He operates from Munden's Bar in the Pit, a slum area of Cynosure, a pan-dimensional city to which all dimensions connect. Publication history Grimjack began as a backup feature in issue 10 of the comic book Starslayer. The character of Grimjack was created by John Ostrander and Timothy Truman, but the setting, the pan-dimensional city of Cynosure, predates the character. The Grimjack backup story was very popular with the readers of Starslayer, and First Comics decided to give the character his own title. The GrimJack back-up story ran from issue 10 to 17. Grimjack guest-starred in the main Starslayer story in issue 18, in July 1984. Issue #1 of Grimjack was published by First Comics in August 1984, and ran until issue #81, in April 1991, with all stories written by Ostrander. Artists who worked on the series included Timothy Truman, Sam Grainger, Tom Mandrake, Jim McDermott, Steve Pugh, Tom Sutton, Paul Guinan, Martin Thomas, and Flint Henry. Throughout its run, with the exception of a few full-length issues (as well as #60 with its expanded letter column), Grimjack featured a back-up story in the manner of other First Comics series. From issue 2 to 69, the backstory was titled Munden's Bar, a telling of events at the eponymous bar. The story brought a small amount of fame to the series for its occasional guest stars, such as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.Grimjack #26 Starting with issue 70 a new back-up feature began, as John Ostrander felt that Munden's Bar was getting too far away from his original intent and he suspended it for reworking. In its place was his own serial entitled Youngblood, drawn by Steve Pugh. Youngblood told the story of John Gaunt's troubled childhood, via flashbacks from a point in Gaunt's life prior to his first published appearance in Starslayer, but after the Demon Wars. It concluded in issue #81. Although one of First Comics' most popular titles, after the company declared bankruptcy, it did not make it into print again until 2005. In 1990, First published Demon Knight, a stand-alone graphic novel featuring the James Twilley incarnation of Grimjack going back in time to the Demon Wars to try to change his fate. Although a stand-alone, the story ties in thematically with the \\"Demon Wars\\" flashback storyline taking place in issues 66‚Äì69 and Twilley appears in a panel of issue 69. First's Grimjack Casefiles, a reprint series covering the Starslayer back-up stories and the first issues of the Grimjack series, ran a total of 5 issues from November 1990 to March 1991. Following their recovering the rights to Grimjack, John Ostrander and Timothy Truman teamed up again to publish Grimjack: Killer Instinct, a 6-issue miniseries published by IDW Publishing. The miniseries, since reprinted in graphic novel form, serves as a prequel to the First Comics Grimjack series and shows John Gaunt's life leading up to his first appearance in Starslayer #10. The series met with critical acclaim for its art, storyline and original setting. With a script by John Ostrander and art by Timothy Truman, the series was lettered by John Workman and edited by Mike Gold. All of them had worked on the original Grimjack comic. IDW Publishing also re- issued the First Comics Grimjack run in a series of trade paperbacks under the title The Legend of Grimjack. As of October 2007, 8 collections have been released. The character was serialized in a new storyline, The Manx Cat, as a Comicmix.com webcomic in January 2011. It has since seen print as a six-issue miniseries through Comicmix's arrangement with IDW Comics. The story involves \\"The Manx Cat\\", a statuette of such a cat that at first seems to be a simple MacGuffin like the classic Maltese Falcon of the novel and films by that name, but which begins showing malevolent powers. The plot thickens with time travel, reincarnation, and Elder Gods. Like most modern comics, it features digitally-created art. Fictional character biography =John Gaunt= John Gaunt, alias Grimjack, was born in The Pit, a slum area of the pan-dimensional city of Cynosure, where both magic and technology, humans and aliens intermingle. His mother Anya (n√©e Laughton) died in childbirth. John had two older brothers, Nick (nicknamed \\"Young Nick\\" and named after their father, \\"Old Nick\\") and Jake. His father married Anya's sister, Maite (nicknamed \\"Mouse\\") and they had one child together, Joe. Joe was the only of his brothers for whom John cared, and he vowed to Mouse that he would watch out for him.Grimjack #75 Old Nick had one brother, Jack.Grimjack #70 Young Nick hated and resented John, blaming him for the death of their mother, the only person who loved him. Throughout John's life, Young Nick manipulated their father into hating John in hopes that he would kill John.Grimjack #79 When John was about five years old, Old Nick attacked and killed Jack in a drunken rage.Grimjack #72 He was sentenced to prison but later escaped. The day he returned home Mouse vanished. It is unknown whether Old Nick killed her. On John's eighth birthday, Old Nick, having decided that Gaunt was actually Jack's son, attacked John with a broken bottle. This caused the distinctive vertical scar that Gaunt carried through his life.Grimjack #73 Old Nick fell in the fireplace and burned to deathGrimjack #74 Following their father's death, the four brothers survived on the streets by stealing. One night they broke into the house of a merchant to rob him. Jake killed the merchant when he discovered them in the house. Nick, Jake and Joe escaped but Nick knocked John unconscious and abandoned him to take the rap for the murder. John was found guilty and sentenced to fight in the Arena of Cynosure. The day he arrived in the Arena he vowed to kill Nick.Grimjack #76 Gaunt joined one of the gangs of child warriors called \\"Wolfpacs.\\"Grimjack #16 During that time, Gaunt went by the name of \\"Grinner\\" and was known as the second-best fighter in the Arena, second only to The Dancer. Gaunt was released from the Arena at age 22 because, while he fought and killed, he refused to make his kills entertaining to the crowd.Grimjack #66 Following his release, Gaunt began a search for his brothers. Attacked and badly wounded in a street fight, Gaunt stumbled upon the entrance to the dimension of Pdwyr. There he was nursed back to health and met the love of his life, a woman named Rhian. He studied magic with Rhian's father, Maethe Mathonwy, but while Gaunt could summon power he did not have the inner peace needed to properly control it. Another Cynosure resident, Major Lash, found his way to Pdwyr and informed Gaunt that the city had been invaded by Hell itself. Lash convinced Gaunt to return to Cynosure and fight in the Demon Wars by persuading him that if the city fell the demons would find and destroy Pdwyr. The city's forces were able to repel Hell but demons invaded Pdwyr, causing the destruction of the land and the death of all those Gaunt loved, including Rhian. After burying his dead, Gaunt joined the Major's group of temporal bounty hunters, the Lawkillers, not knowing that it was Major Lash who had betrayed Pdwyr to the demons. Gaunt would not learn the truth for some 25 years. At age 30, John Gaunt had a final fateful confrontation with his brothers. Nick shot John, leading Joe to draw his gun and shoot Nick. Jake then shot Joe and Joe shot Jake. John shot Nick. Jake shot Joe again, killing him. John then finished Jake. Nick shot John again and John killed Nick.Grimjack #80 After leaving the Lawkillers, Gaunt joined the Trans-Dimensional Police, Cynosure's police department. Upon quitting the TDP, he was enlisted as the first member of Cadre, a spy agency of the Cynosure government. After the events detailed in the Grimjack: Killer Instinct storyline, he abandoned Cadre and set himself up as a mercenary and private investigator in Cynosure. At some point he purchased the bar known as Munden's, apparently named after bartender Gordon Munden, from Munden's ex- wife.Grimjack: The Manx Cat #5 =Grimjack clone= During a bloody conflict with the Lawkillers, Gaunt managed to kill two of Major Lash's men, Preacher and Grunt, but turned his back on Lash, disgusted with the senseless bloodshed and murder, including the revelation that the enemy he had killed months ago was his biological son. Lash seized this opportunity and killed Grimjack.Grimjack #36 Gaunt was shocked to find himself in Heaven, where he was reunited with his former love, Rhian. He was informed that for all his faults, he always stood by his friends, and for that he was judged worthy.Grimjack #38 But he soon discovers that The Dancer has reanimated Gaunt's corpse in order to murder his friend Blackjacmac. Gaunt was horrified at this, as Blackjacmac would likely go to Hell if he were to die at this point in his life. Forfeiting a peaceful Afterlife, but continuing to act for the benefit of his friends, Gaunt returned to Cynosure by animating a clone body of himself at an age several decades younger than his original body. In this body, Gaunt operated under the alias \\"Chaney\\"Grimjack #39 and had increased psychic sensitivity.Grimjack #40 Gaunt operated under this identity for several months, gradually re-establishing relationships with his friends, until he met a man claiming to be an incarnation of himself from 3,000 years in the future. This \\"FutureJack\\" tells Gaunt that when he left Heaven, he was barred from returning to either Heaven or Hell. Gaunt is condemned to be reborn eternally.Grimjack #53 \\"FutureJack\\" convinces Gaunt that his doom is tied to the fate of Cynosure and to accompany him on a mission to hasten the destruction of the city. During the mission Gaunt realizes that \\"FutureJack\\" is lying to him and shoots him. \\"FutureJack\\" is apparently destroyed.Grimjack #54 =James Twilley= Grimjack was reborn as James Edgar Twilley, the son of a rich Cynosure family. Initially unaware of his past life, Twilley began remembering at around age 14 when he witnessed a thug murdering a jock who bullied him in high school. Twilley murdered the thug and marked himself with the trademark Grimjack scar of his previous life. Twilley went underground, disappearing from his family and friends as he set about re-learning his past skills. When he was ready, Twilley showed up at Munden's and, using a clause written into the ownership contract of the bar, claimed his identity as well as the bar. Sometime later, his family, distraught over the changes that their son had undergone, kidnapped him and forced him into a personality restructuring therapy to erase the troubling memories, but when presented with a copy of John Gaunt as supposed proof that Twilley's memories were false, he flew in a frenzy and ripped out the Gaunt copy's throat with his teeth. Discovering his family's manipulations, James Twilley left his family and assumed once again the street name of Grimjack with Munden's Bar as his base of operations. James Twilley died in issue #81 of Grimjack, concluding First Comics' run. =Supporting characters= :See List of characters in Grimjack Other appearances Grimjack's first published appearance was in a back-up story in First's Warp, \\"The Dogs of War\\", featuring the character Sargon, Mistress of War. The story opens in Munden's Bar and Gaunt appears in shadow in one panel, although this was not known at the time. Ostrander identified this figure as Gaunt years later. In addition to his own series, Grimjack made appearances in two Munden's Bar specials and a few First Comics crossover specials including The Gift and Crossroads. Away from First, Gaunt's corpse made a one-panel appearance as a sight gag in issue #5 of the DC Comics horror anthology title Wasteland. In the fourth chapter of his 1986 Amber novel Blood of Amber, Roger Zelazny introduced a character named \\"Old John,\\" who works as an emissary for the King of Amber. Old John is described as having a \\"nasty- looking scar running both above and below his left eye\\" and a \\"nasty grin,\\" wearing a dark feathered hat.Zelazny, pp. 740‚Äì41. Zelazny, a fan of the Grimjack series since its premiere issue, later contributed the introduction to the Grimjack graphic novel Demon Knight. In the short story \\"The Shroudling and the Guisel,\\" published posthumously in Amberzine #8, Zelazny refers to Grimjack by name: \\"I stood among the grave markers of unknown mortals‚ÄîDennis Colt, Remo Williams, John Gaunt‚Äîand swore to be her champion if ever she needed one.\\" This story was later reprinted in the Zelazny collection Manna from Heaven. Legal history Following the bankruptcy of First Comics in 1991, the legal rights to Grimjack became tied up with First Comics' other assets. Ken F. Levin, co-founder of First Comics, and Mike Gold, Grimjack's original editor, set out to free the rights to the character from legal limbo. There were several reports over the years that the problem was not the rights to Grimjack, invariably stated in these accounts to be owned outright by Ostrander, but those to its setting, the pan-dimensional city of Cynosure, which was the property of First Comics. The unique nature of the place was crucial to many of Ostrander's storylines, and some observers even considered it to be a \\"character\\" in its own right. After 12 years of efforts, all rights to Grimjack were released and a new company was founded, NightSky GrimJack Rights and Production Vehicle (Four Wheel Drive Model), LLC, with legal ownership to the character. John Ostrander and Timothy Truman are said to have \\"substantial equity positions\\" in the venture. In other media J. Michael Straczynski had reportedly planned to write a film adaptation of Grimjack during his time on Babylon 5. He initially planned to produce the script during the summer of 1996, but timing conflicts prevented him from doing it. As a result, the project was put on hold, and has not been resurrected since. According to Straczynski, the film was budgeted for $30 million, and as scriptwriter, Straczynski intended to remain as faithful as possible to the source material. At San Diego Comic-Con 2019, the Russo brothers announced their production company AGBO were developing a television series adaptation for Amazon. It's being written by Kevin Murphy and the Russo brothers will produce the show.  References  =Notes= =Sources= * Zelazny, Roger (1986).

It has unlimited jurisdiction within the state in civil matters (although it usually only hears matters involving sums of A$750,000 or more), and hears the most serious criminal matters. Structure The Supreme Court consists of a General Division (equivalent to the Trial Division in other states) and the Court of Appeal. The General Division deals with serious criminal matters, civil cases where the amount claimed is greater than $750,000, criminal appeals from the Magistrates Court and appeals from other bodies such as the State Administrative Tribunal. The General Division sits in the David Malcolm Justice Centre for civil proceedings and the District Court of WA Building and the original Supreme Court Building for criminal proceedings. The Court of Appeal hears both civil and criminal appeals from cases in the General Division, the District Court and the State Administrative Tribunal. It sits in the original Supreme Court Building. When required, Supreme Court judges may also constitute the Industrial Appeal Court and sit as a Court of Disputed Returns. The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is Peter Quinlan SC who was appointed to the position in August 2018. History The Supreme Court was established on 18 June 1861 when the Court of Quarter Sessions (a criminal court for serious matters) and the Civil Court were amalgamated. Sir Archibald Burt was the first Chief Justice of the court. The Full Court of the Supreme Court was established in 1886 to decide both criminal and civil appeals. In 1893 the criminal appeals were transferred to the Court of Appeal which was then reconstituted as the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1911. The Supreme Court, Full Court and Court of Criminal Appeal were effectively the one court with each judge able to sit on cases in any of the courts. In 2004 the Full Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal were subsumed by the Court of Appeal, which, while still a division of the Supreme Court, has judges which sit solely on appeal cases. Judicial officers The Supreme Court is currently constituted by the following judicial officers (in order of seniority): =Chief Justice= * Peter Quinlan (13 August 2018) =President of the Court of Appeal= * Michael Buss (18 July 2016; appointed as Judge of Appeal on 1 February 2006) =Judges of the Court of Appeal= * Graeme Murphy (3 August 2010; appointed as Judge on 28 April 2009) * Robert Mazza (2011; appointed as Judge on 4 March 2010) * Robert Mitchell (18 July 2016; appointed as Judge in October 2014) * Andrew Beech (24 May 2017; appointed as Judge on 25 June 2007) * Janine Pritchard (President, State Administrative Tribunal as of 4 June 2019; appointed as Judge of Appeal on 13 September 2018; appointed as Judge on 11 June 2010) * John Vaughan (4 June 2019; appointed as Judge on 30 April 2018) =Judges of the General Division= * Rene Le Miere (Senior Puisne Judge) (2 February 2004) * Lindy Jenkins (2 February 2004) * Kenneth Martin (23 March 2009) * Stephen Hall (6 July 2009) * Michael Corboy (19 April 2010) * Jeremy Allanson (9 August 2010) * Jeremy Curthoys (10 February 2014) * Paul Tottle (10 August 2015) * Bruno Fiannaca (31 August 2015) * Joseph McGrath (28 November 2016) * Gail Archer (29 May 2017) * Anthony Derrick (6 March 2018) * Jennifer Smith (27 June 2018; acting judge from 1 August 2017) * Jenni Hill (4 June 2019) =Master= * Craig Sanderson =Principal Registrar= * Natalie Whitby =Registrars= * Christopher Boyle * Sandra Boyle * Danielle Davies * Simon Dixon * June Eaton (Registrar Court of Appeal) * Rainer Gilich * Janet Whitbread Supreme Court building The Supreme Court building has considerable heritage significance in Western Australia. In 1899, a joint parliamentary committee was formed to decide on the location of the new court building with three sites being considered. The locations were a site in Irwin Street, the old Government Boys' School on St George's Terrace and the current site. After a decision was made and a contract awarded for ¬£55,888 11s 3p to RP Vincent and Sons in February 1901, an announcement was made to the public during March of that year. The foundation stone was laid on 2 June 1902 and would open on 8 June 1903 with WA Governor Sir Frederick Bedford present as was the Chief Justice Sir Edward Stone and the full court. The two-storey brick building was designed by John Harry Grainger (father of Percy Grainger), Chief Architect with the Public Works Department of Western Australia. It is designed in the Federation Academic Classical style: a style that was often used for major public buildings of the time. The original design called for only local materials to be used with Donnybrook stone, Meckering granite and jarrah wood the choice. Stuccoed cement had to be substituted when insufficient quantities of Donnybrook stone of identical texture and colour were lacking for the building. Another change was the slate roof, when a galvanized roof was installed instead saving ¬£5,425. Originally, the grand foyer was to be painted in colours reflecting those of the glass domes, but again shortage of funds dictated the substitution of whitewash. The foyer was more appropriately redecorated to celebrate the Court‚Äôs centenary in 2003.

Differential motion along the zone produces numerous earthquakes, the foci of which may be as deep as about . The term was named for the two seismologists, Hugo Benioff of the California Institute of Technology and Kiyoo Wadati of the Japan Meteorological Agency, who independently discovered the zones. Wadati‚ÄìBenioff zone earthquakes develop beneath volcanic island arcs and continental margins above active subduction zones. They can be produced by slip along the subduction thrust fault or slip on faults within the downgoing plate, as a result of bending and extension as the plate is pulled into the mantle. The deep-focus earthquakes along the zone allow seismologists to map the three- dimensional surface of a subducting slab of oceanic crust and mantle. Discovery In 1949, Hugo Benioff introduced a method for determining elastic-rebound strain increments of earthquakes on a particular fault. He determined that the square root of an earthquake's energy is proportional to both the elastic rebound strain increment and the rebound displacement, and developed a way to determine whether a series of earthquakes was generated along a single fault structure. His research focused on the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone and the South American subduction zone, and determined that in both locations, earthquake foci fall along planes dipping ~45¬∞ from the trenches. These planes of seismicity were later termed Benioff zones, or Wadati‚ÄìBenioff zones for Kiyoo Wadati, who made similar observations independent of Benioff at the same time. Structure  The angle of dip of the subducting slab, and therefore the Benioff seismic zone, is dominantly controlled by the negative buoyancy of the slab and forces from the flowing of the asthenosphere. Younger lithosphere is hotter and more buoyant, resulting in shallow-dipping Benioff zones, whereas older lithosphere is denser and colder, causing steeper dips. The Benioff zone spans from near-surface to depths of up to 670 km. The upper bound is just beneath the weak sediments in the toe of the wedge of the subduction zone, and the lower bound is where the brittle-ductile transition occurs. Most earthquakes occur within the 1000 ¬∞C isotherm, in the interior of the slab that has not yet heated up to match the temperature of the surrounding mantle into which it is being subducted. At depths below the thickness of the lithosphere, earthquakes are no longer generated by thrusting at the interface of the two plates, because the asthenosphere is weak and cannot support the stresses necessary for faulting. In this region, internal deformation of the still-cool down-going slab is the source of the earthquakes. Up to depths of 300 km, dehydration reactions and the formation of eclogite are the main causes of seismicity. Below 300 km, beginning at approximately the 700 ¬∞C isotherm, a mineralogical phase change from olivine to spinel occurs, and is thought to be the dominant earthquake mechanism of these very deep-seated earthquakes. Double Benioff zones In some cases, subduction zones show two parallel surfaces of seismicity separated by tens of kilometres at intermediate depths (50‚Äì200 km). A primary example of this is located along Japan's largest island of Honshu, where the Wadati‚ÄìBenioff zone is characterized by two well-defined lines of earthquake foci, with a distance between each line of 30‚Äì40 kilometers. A study of the global prevalence of double Benioff zones has found that they are common in subduction zones worldwide. The uppermost seismicity surface is in the crust of the down-going slab and attributed to the dehydration reactions within this oceanic crust resulting in the formation of eclogite. The mechanism behind the lower zone of seismicity, located in the upper mantle portion of the down- going lithosphere, is still debated; the global ubiquity of double Benioff zones indicates that it must be a process that commonly occurs in subduction zones. Some of the suggested instability mechanisms include dehydration embrittlement caused by the breakdown of antigorite or chlorite in a hydrated peridotite upper mantle, and un-bending of the slab. Observations from seismic studies indicate that the lithospheric mantle at the intermediate depths where double Benioff zones occur is dry, which favours the proposed slab-unbending mechanism.

The Supreme Court is the highest South Australian court in the Australian court hierarchy. It has unlimited jurisdiction within the state in civil matters, and hears the most serious criminal matters. The Court is composed of a Chief Justice and as many other judges (called justices) as may be required. History The Court was established by Letters Patent on 2 January 1837, five days after the colony was founded. The Court is unique among Australia's state supreme courts in that it was established at the foundation of the colony of South Australia, as the notion of a supreme court was a part of the colony's founder, Edward Wakefield's theory of colonisation. Other Australian colonies only established their courts long after the settlement of the colony. The Court was endowed with all the common law and probate jurisdiction of the courts of Westminster. The first sessions of the Court were not held until May 1837, presided over by Sir John Jeffcott, the first judge of the court. (The title of Chief Justice was not officially introduced until the coming into force of Act No 31 of 1855-1856.) After Sir John's death in December 1837, Henry Jickling was appointed as an acting judge. Although appointed as a caretaker judge, Jickling was responsible for two important developments: he codified the testamentary causes jurisdiction of the court and admitted the first practitioners of the Supreme Court in March 1838. Justice Jeffcott's permanent replacement on the Court was Sir Charles Cooper. Reports of ill health prompted Governor Henry Young to ask for the appointment of a second judge. As a result Justice Crawford was appointed. Justice Crawford was the first justice to wear a wig in court. Crawford died after only two years on the bench. Crawford was replaced by Justice Boothby. Boothby was a controversial judge who did not believe in the power of the colonial parliaments to enact laws. He arguably started the first constitutional crisis in Australian history when he ruled that the South Australian Constitution of 1856 was invalid, causing the Imperial Parliament to pass the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865. Boothby was removed as a justice of the Supreme Court in July 1867. He appealed to the Privy Council in England but died before his appeal could be heard. During Boothby's time on the Court, the first Queen's Counsels were appointed and the first circuit sittings of the Court took place in country South Australia. In 1935 the Supreme Court Act commenced.Supreme Court Act 1935 (SA) Jurisdiction The Court exercises both original and appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters. The Court is a court of both law and equity. Though it has unlimited jurisdiction in civil matters, generally civil trials heard in the Court are those involving complex legal or factual issues or large sums of money. The Court also has exclusive jurisdiction in probate (wills & estates), meaning it is the only South Australian court that can hear such matters. In criminal matters, generally only the most serious crimes are tried in the Court (for example murder, treason, attempted murder and manslaughter) although the Court occasionally hears trials for less serious offences. Trials for murder and treason cannot be heard in any other court in South Australia. When exercising its original jurisdiction, the Court is usually composed of a single judge. The Supreme Court hears appeals from the Magistrates Court of South Australia in both civil and criminal matters, and also from decisions of Supreme Court Masters and various other tribunals. In such cases, the Court ordinarily consists of a single judge. The Court sits as a Full Court (usually consisting of a bench of three judges) when it hears appeals from the decisions of a single judge of the Supreme Court or District Court, or from certain other tribunals. Some of these appeals lie as of right, while others require leave (permission) from either the court appealed from or the Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court sits as a Full Court in criminal matters (other than those originating in the Magistrates Court and Youth Court), it is commonly referred to as the \\"Court of Criminal Appeal\\". Unlike the supreme courts of some other states, the Supreme Court of South Australia is not divided into separate trial and appeal divisions. From time to time, all judges of the court sit in civil and criminal trials and as members of the Full Court and Court of Criminal Appeal. There is a division of the Court known as the Land and Valuation Court, which has jurisdiction over matters arising under particular State statutes dealing with planning and development law. Judges are assigned to this division by proclamation. In addition, particular judges may be designated to sit in the probate jurisdiction or assigned case management functions in respect of long and complex trials. The proceedings of the Supreme Court of South Australia are normally heard in Adelaide. In civil cases the Court normally sits in the old Supreme Court building, while criminal matters are generally heard in the Sir Samuel Way Building. (The two buildings are located across the road from each other, on the corner of Gouger Street and Victoria Square.) The Court is empowered to sit in any place, including outside the State. The Court, consisting of a single judge, regularly travels on circuit to the rural centres of Mount Gambier and Port Augusta. Subject to statutory exceptions, an appeal is available by special leave to the High Court of Australia from all decisions of the Supreme Court of South Australia by virtue of s 73 of the Australian Constitution. Ordinarily, appeals are taken to the High Court only from decisions of the Full Court or Court of Criminal Appeal.

He started his career in the late Eastern Han dynasty as a minor official. In 189, when the warlord Dong Zhuo took control of the Han central government, he assigned Jia Xu to the unit led by Niu Fu, his son-in-law. In 192, after Dong Zhuo was assassinated by L√º Bu, Jia Xu advised Li Jue, Guo Si and Dong Zhuo's loyalists to fight back and seize control of the imperial capital, Chang'an, from a new central government headed by L√º Bu and Wang Yun. After Li Jue and the others defeated L√º Bu and occupied Chang'an, Jia Xu served under the central government led by them. During this time, he ensured the safety of the figurehead Han emperor, Emperor Xian, who was being held hostage by Li Jue. He also attempted to prevent internal conflict between Li Jue and Guo Si, but with limited success. After Emperor Xian escaped from Chang'an, Jia Xu left Li Jue and briefly joined the general Duan Wei before becoming a strategist of the warlord Zhang Xiu. While serving under Zhang Xiu, he advised his lord on how to counter invasions by the warlord Cao Cao, who had received Emperor Xian in 196 and taken control of the central government. In 200, during the Battle of Guandu between Cao Cao and his rival Yuan Shao, Jia Xu urged Zhang Xiu to reject Yuan Shao's offer to form an alliance and instead surrender to Cao Cao. Zhang Xiu heeded his advice. Jia Xu then became one of Cao Cao's strategists. During his service under Cao Cao, Jia Xu made three important contributions. First, during the Battle of Guandu, he urged Cao Cao to switch from being on the defensive to adopting an offensive stance, which ultimately led to Cao Cao's decisive victory over Yuan Shao. Second, during the Battle of Tong Pass in 211, he suggested to Cao Cao to pretend to agree to make peace with the northwestern warlords Han Sui and Ma Chao, and then sow discord between them. Cao Cao heeded his suggestion, successfully stirred up internal conflict among the warlords, and then used the opportunity to defeat them. Thirdly, in the 210s, when Cao Cao's sons Cao Pi and Cao Zhi were fighting to be their father's successor, Jia Xu indirectly helped Cao Pi by giving him advice and hinting to Cao Cao that he should choose the older son to be his heir apparent. After Cao Cao's death in 220, Cao Pi ended the Eastern Han dynasty by forcing Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him, and founded the state of Cao Wei with himself as the emperor. As an expression of gratitude to Jia Xu, Cao Pi appointed him as Grand Commandant ‚Äì one of the top three positions in the Wei government ‚Äì and promoted him to a district marquis. Between 220 and 223, Jia Xu advised Cao Pi against attacking Cao Wei's rival states, Eastern Wu and Shu Han, and focus on internal development. However, Cao Pi ignored his advice and invaded Wu, but ended up sustaining heavy losses and not making any significant gains. Jia Xu died in 223. Early life and career Jia Xu was from Guzang County (ÂßëËáßÁ∏£), Wuwei Commandery (Ê≠¶Â®ÅÈÉ°), which is in present-day Wuwei, Gansu. In his youth, he was unimpressive and unheard of. However, Yan Zhong (ÈñªÂø†), an official from Hanyang Commandery (Êº¢ÈôΩÈÉ°; around present-day Gangu County, Gansu), felt that Jia Xu was extraordinary and even remarked that Jia had the brilliance of Zhang Liang and Chen Ping, two famous strategists of the early Western Han dynasty.(Ë≥àË©°Â≠óÊñáÂíåÔºåÊ≠¶Â®ÅÂßëËáß‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇÂ∞ëÊôÇ‰∫∫Ëé´Áü•ÔºåÂîØÊº¢ÈôΩÈñªÂø†Áï∞‰πãÔºåË¨ÇË©°ÊúâËâØ„ÄÅÂπ≥‰πãÂ•á„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 10. Jia Xu was nominated as a xiaolian to serve in the Eastern Han government as a Gentleman Cadet (ÈÉé). However, due to illness, he quit his job and went home. On the way back, he was captured by Di rebels at Qian County (Ê±ßÁ∏£; in present-day Long County, Shaanxi) along with several other travellers. He told the rebels: \\"I am a maternal grandson of Lord Duan. If you let me live, my family will reward you handsomely.\\" \\"Lord Duan\\" referred to Duan Jiong (ÊÆµÁÜ≤), who held the position of Grand Commandant (Â§™Â∞â) in the Han imperial court. As Duan Jiong had served for years as a general guarding the Han Empire's western regions, he was well known among the people living in the area. Jia Xu knew that the Di rebels were afraid of Duan Jiong, so he pretended to be Duan Jiong's maternal grandson. As he expected, the rebels treated him respectfully and released him. The other travellers were all killed.(ÂØüÂ≠ùÂªâÁÇ∫ÈÉéÔºåÁñæÁóÖÂéªÂÆòÔºåË•øÈÇÑËá≥Ê±ßÔºåÈÅìÈÅáÂèõÊ∞êÔºåÂêåË°åÊï∏ÂçÅ‰∫∫ÁöÜÁÇ∫ÊâÄÂü∑„ÄÇË©°Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊàëÊÆµÂÖ¨Â§ñÂ≠´‰πüÔºåÊ±ùÂà•ÂüãÊàëÔºåÊàëÂÆ∂ÂøÖÂéöË¥ñ‰πã„ÄÇ„ÄçÊôÇÂ§™Â∞âÊÆµÁÜ≤ÔºåÊòî‰πÜÁÇ∫ÈÇäÂ∞áÔºåÂ®ÅÈúáË•øÂúüÔºåÊïÖË©°ÂÅá‰ª•ÊáºÊ∞ê„ÄÇÊ∞êÊûú‰∏çÊï¢ÂÆ≥ÔºåËàáÁõüËÄåÈÄÅ‰πãÔºåÂÖ∂È§òÊÇâÊ≠ª„ÄÇË©°ÂØ¶ÈùûÊÆµÁî•ÔºåÊ¨ä‰ª•Êøü‰∫ãÔºåÂí∏Ê≠§È°û‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 10.

The rest of Dong Zhuo's loyalists, including Li Jue, Guo Si and Zhang Ji, became fearful and wanted to disband and return to their respective home commanderies. Jia Xu told them: \\"I heard that the new government in Chang'an is planning to exterminate everyone from Liang Province. If all of you break up and travel alone, even a tingzhang can arrest you. Why don't you retreat to the west together? There you can gather and reorganise your forces, and then attack Chang'an to avenge Lord Dong. If you succeed, you can make use of imperial authority to conquer the rest of the Empire. If you fail, it's still not too late to escape.\\" Dong Zhuo's loyalists agreed with Jia Xu and did as he suggested.

However, due to Jia Xu's suggestion, the Han Empire became even more chaotic after Dong Zhuo's death.(Ëá£Êùæ‰πã‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÂÇ≥Á®±„Äå‰ªÅ‰∫∫‰πãË®ÄÔºåÂÖ∂Âà©ÊÑΩÂìâ„ÄçÔºÅÁÑ∂Ââá‰∏ç‰ªÅ‰πãË®ÄÔºåÁêÜÂøÖÂèçÊòØ„ÄÇÂ§´‰ªÅÂäüÈõ£ËëóÔºåËÄå‰∫ÇÊ∫êÊòìÊàêÔºåÊòØÊïÖÊúâÁ¶çÊ©ü‰∏ÄÁôºËÄåÊÆÉÊµÅÁôæ‰∏ñËÄÖÁü£„ÄÇÁï∂ÊòØÊôÇÔºåÂÖÉÊÉ°Êó£Ê¢üÔºåÂ§©Âú∞ÂßãÈñãÔºåËá¥‰ΩøÂé≤ÈöéÈáçÁµêÔºåÂ§ßÊ¢óÊÆ∑ÊµÅÔºåÈÇ¶ÂúãÈÅòÊÆÑÊÇ¥‰πãÂìÄÔºåÈªéÊ∞ëÂ¨∞Âë®È§ò‰πãÈÖ∑ÔºåË±à‰∏çÁî±Ë≥àË©°ÁâáË®Ä‰πéÔºüË©°‰πãÁΩ™‰πüÔºå‰∏Ä‰ΩïÂ§ßÂìâÔºÅËá™Âè§ÂÖÜ‰∫ÇÔºåÊú™ÊúâÂ¶ÇÊ≠§‰πãÁîö„ÄÇ) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 10. Service under Li Jue When Jia Xu later served as Left Adjunct (Â∑¶È¶ÆÁøä), Li Jue and Dong Zhuo's loyalists wanted to reward him by making him a marquis, but Jia Xu said, \\"That suggestion I made was meant to save your lives. What merit have I achieved to deserve a reward?\\" He declined to accept the marquis title. Later on, when he was nominated to serve as a Supervisor of the Masters of Writing (Â∞öÊõ∏ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), he said: \\"The Supervisor of the Masters of Writing is like a tutor to officials. I don't have a strong reputation so I am afraid I might not be able to convince people that I am suited for this appointment. What will become of the imperial court if I accept this appointment for my personal glory?\\" He was then assigned to be a Master of Writing (Â∞öÊõ∏) instead, and was tasked with selecting candidates to serve in the government. Li Jue and the others regarded him highly but were also wary of him.(ÂæåË©°ÁÇ∫Â∑¶È¶ÆÁøäÔºåÂÇïÁ≠âÊ¨≤‰ª•Âäü‰æØ‰πãÔºåË©°Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊ≠§ÊïëÂëΩ‰πãË®àÔºå‰ΩïÂäü‰πãÊúâÔºÅ„ÄçÂõ∫Ëæ≠‰∏çÂèó„ÄÇÂèà‰ª•ÁÇ∫Â∞öÊõ∏ÂÉïÂ∞ÑÔºåË©°Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ∞öÊõ∏ÂÉïÂ∞ÑÔºåÂÆò‰πãÂ∏´Èï∑ÔºåÂ§©‰∏ãÊâÄÊúõÔºåË©°Âêç‰∏çÁ¥†ÈáçÔºåÈùûÊâÄ‰ª•Êúç‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇÁ∏±Ë©°ÊòßÊñºÊ¶ÆÂà©ÔºåÊü∞ÂúãÊúù‰ΩïÔºÅ„Äç‰πÉÊõ¥ÊãúË©°Â∞öÊõ∏ÔºåÂÖ∏ÈÅ∏ËàâÔºåÂ§öÊâÄÂå°ÊøüÔºåÂÇïÁ≠âË¶™ËÄåÊÜö‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 10.

Guo Si, on the other hand, kidnapped Emperor Xian's subjects and held them hostage in his own camp. Zhang Xiu told Jia Xu, \\"You shouldn't stay here any longer.

Li Jue used material wealth to tempt thousands of Qiang tribesmen to support him in his struggle against Guo Si. He even promised to give palace women as concubines to the tribal chiefs. When the tribesmen showed up at Chang'an, they asked: \\"Is the Emperor inside? General Li has promised to give us palace women as concubines. Where are they?\\" Emperor Xian turned to Jia Xu for help. Jia Xu secretly hosted a banquet for the tribal chiefs, gave them some expensive material gifts, and succeeded in making them leave.

Jia Xu was well known among Duan Wei's men, so Duan Wei was fearful that Jia Xu would seize the position of leadership from him. He pretended to treat Jia Xu respectfully while secretly keeping a close watch on him.

Before Jia Xu left Duan Wei, someone asked him, \\"(Duan) Wei treated you generously. Why are you leaving?\\" Jia Xu replied, \\"(Duan) Wei is suspicious by nature and he's wary of me.

However, he pulled back his forces after learning that Tian Feng, an adviser to his rival, Yuan Shao, had urged Yuan Shao to attack Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan) while he was away at war with Zhang Xiu. Zhang Xiu wanted to seize the opportunity to launch a counterattack, but Jia Xu warned him not to and predicted that he would be lose the battle. Zhang Xiu ignored him and led his troops to pursue Cao Cao's retreating forces. The result was just like what Jia Xu predicted. When Zhang Xiu came back after his defeat, Jia Xu told him to attack again and predicted that he would win this time. Zhang Xiu said: \\"I didn't listen to you earlier, which resulted in my defeat. Now that I have lost, why should I attack again?\\" Jia Xu replied: \\"Changes have taken place. You'll win if you swiftly attack now.\\" Zhang Xiu heeded Jia Xu's advice and attacked Cao Cao again.

But why is it that your predictions seem so counter-intuitive?\\" Jia Xu replied: \\"It's easy to understand. General, you may be skilled in warfare, but you are still no match for Cao Cao. When Cao Cao withdrew his forces, I knew he would personally lead his rearguard to cover his retreat. Even though your troops are well-trained, Cao Cao is better than you as a military leader, and his troops are as equally well-trained as yours. Therefore, I knew you would lose. When Cao Cao first attacked you and decided to retreat halfway even though he didn't make any mistakes, I believed something must have happened in his base. After he defeated your pursuing forces, he would lower his guard and hastily retreat. His officers will then take command of the rearguard. They may be brave, but they are no match for you. Therefore, I knew you would win them even though you are leading a group of soldiers who have just been defeated.\\" Zhang Xiu was very impressed with Jia Xu's analysis.(ÂïèË©°Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁπ°‰ª•Á≤æÂÖµËøΩÈÄÄËªçÔºåËÄåÂÖ¨Êõ∞ÂøÖÊïóÔºõÈÄÄ‰ª•ÊïóÂçíÊìäÂãùÂÖµÔºåËÄåÂÖ¨Êõ∞ÂøÖÂâã„ÄÇÊÇâÂ¶ÇÂÖ¨Ë®ÄÔºå‰ΩïÂÖ∂ÂèçËÄåÁöÜÈ©ó‰πüÔºü„ÄçË©°Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊ≠§ÊòìÁü•ËÄ≥„ÄÇÂ∞áËªçÈõñÂñÑÁî®ÂÖµÔºåÈùûÊõπÂÖ¨Êïµ‰πü„ÄÇËªçÈõñÊñ∞ÈÄÄÔºåÊõπÂÖ¨ÂøÖËá™Êñ∑ÂæåÔºõËøΩÂÖµÈõñÁ≤æÔºåÂ∞áÊó£‰∏çÊïµÔºåÂΩºÂ£´‰∫¶Èä≥ÔºåÊïÖÁü•ÂøÖÊïó„ÄÇÊõπÂÖ¨ÊîªÂ∞áËªçÁÑ°Â§±Á≠ñÔºåÂäõÊú™Áõ°ËÄåÈÄÄÔºåÂøÖÂúãÂÖßÊúâÊïÖÔºõÂ∑≤Á†¥Â∞áËªçÔºåÂøÖËºïËªçÈÄüÈÄ≤ÔºåÁ∏±ÁïôË´∏Â∞áÊñ∑ÂæåÔºåË´∏Â∞áÈõñÂãáÔºå‰∫¶ÈùûÂ∞áËªçÊïµÔºåÊïÖÈõñÁî®ÊïóÂÖµËÄåÊà∞ÂøÖÂãù‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÁπ°‰πÉÊúç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 10. =Persuading Zhang Xiu to surrender to Cao Cao= In 199, when Cao Cao and Yuan Shao were about to clash at the Battle of Guandu, Yuan Shao sent a messenger to meet Zhang Xiu and propose an alliance between them against Cao Cao.

What will happen if I submit to him?\\" Jia Xu replied: \\"That's why it is better for you to submit to Cao Cao. He controls the Empire in the name of the Emperor. This is the first reason why you should submit to him. Yuan Shao is militarily more powerful. You have less troops than him, so even if you join him, he won't regard you highly. Cao Cao has less troops. If you join him, he'll be delighted. This is the second reason why you should submit to him. A man who aspires to become a great ruler will be more willing to put aside personal enmities and make his virtues known to people. This is the third reason why you should submit to Cao Cao.

Pei Songzhi, who annotated Jia Xu's biography in the Sanguozhi, argued that Jia Xu's advice to Cao Cao was inappropriate. He pointed out that Cao Cao's territories lacked the stability necessary for Cao Cao to do as Jia Xu advised ‚Äì focus on economic development in Jing Province. Moreover, Cao Cao had to deal with the external threats posed by warlords such as Han Sui and Ma Chao in the northwest. Pei Songzhi noted that Jing Province was highly unstable and would not remain under Cao Cao's control for long, because of the polarising effects of the presences of Liu Bei and Sun Quan in the region. He pointed out that during the Battle of Jiangling in 208, Cao Cao's general Cao Ren still lost Jiangling Commandery to Sun Quan and Liu Bei's forces despite his best efforts at defending it. Pei Songzhi thus concluded that it was impossible for Cao Cao to focus on economic development in Jing Province, given how unstable the region was, therefore Jia Xu's advice was inappropriate. He argued that Cao Cao made a right choice to attack Jiangdong at the right time, when he had resources for naval warfare acquired from his recent annexation of Jing Province. He also mentioned that Cao Cao's defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs was not due to miscalculation or poor planning, but because of uncontrollable factors such as the plague which affected his troops and the winds which fanned the fire that destroyed his naval fleet.(Ëá£Êùæ‰πã‰ª•ÁÇ∫Ë©°‰πãÊ≠§Ë¨ÄÔºåÊú™ÂêàÁï∂ÊôÇ‰πãÂÆú„ÄÇ‰∫éÊôÇÈüì„ÄÅÈ¶¨‰πãÂæíÂ∞öÁãºÈ°ßÈóúÂè≥ÔºåÈ≠èÊ≠¶‰∏çÂæóÂÆâÂùêÈÉ¢ÈÉΩ‰ª•Â®ÅÊá∑Âê≥ÊúÉÔºå‰∫¶Â∑≤ÊòéÁü£„ÄÇÂΩºËçäÂ∑ûËÄÖÔºåÂ≠´„ÄÅÂäâ‰πãÊâÄÂøÖÁà≠‰πü„ÄÇËçä‰∫∫ÊúçÂäâ‰∏ª‰πãÈõÑÂßøÔºåÊÜöÂ≠´Ê¨ä‰πãÊ≠¶Áï•ÔºåÁÇ∫Êó•Êó£‰πÜÔºåË™†ÈùûÊõπÊ∞èË´∏Â∞áÊâÄËÉΩÊäóÁ¶¶„ÄÇÊïÖÊõπ‰ªÅÂÆàÊ±üÈôµÔºåÊïó‰∏çÊóãË∏µÔºå‰ΩïÊí´ÂÆâ‰πãÂæóË°åÔºåÁ®ΩÊúç‰πãÂèØÊúüÔºüÂ∞áÊ≠§Êó£Êñ∞Âπ≥Ê±ü„ÄÅÊº¢ÔºåÂ®ÅÊáæÊèö„ÄÅË∂äÔºåË≥áÂäâË°®Ê∞¥Êà∞‰πãÂÖ∑ÔºåËóâËçäÊ•öÊ™ùÊ´Ç‰πãÊâãÔºåÂØ¶ÈúáËï©‰πãËâØÊúÉÔºåÂªìÂÆö‰πãÂ§ßÊ©ü„ÄÇ‰∏ç‰πòÊ≠§ÂèñÂê≥ÔºåÂ∞áÂÆâ‰øüÂìâÔºüËá≥ÊñºËµ§Â£Å‰πãÊïóÔºåËìãÊúâÈÅãÊï∏„ÄÇÂØ¶Áî±ÁñæÁñ´Â§ßËààÔºå‰ª•ÊêçÊ∑©Âé≤‰πãÈãíÔºåÂá±È¢®Ëá™ÂçóÔºåÁî®ÊàêÁÑöÂ¶Ç‰πãÂã¢„ÄÇÂ§©ÂØ¶ÁÇ∫‰πãÔºåË±à‰∫∫‰∫ãÂìâÔºüÁÑ∂ÂâáÈ≠èÊ≠¶‰πãÊù±‰∏ãÔºåÈùûÂ§±Á≠≠‰πü„ÄÇË©°‰πãÊ≠§Ë¶èÔºåÁÇ∫ÁÑ°Áï∂Áü£„ÄÇÈ≠èÊ≠¶ÂæåÂÖãÂπ≥ÂºµÈ≠ØÔºåËúÄ‰∏≠‰∏ÄÊó•Êï∏ÂçÅÈ©öÔºåÂäâÂÇôÈõñÊñ¨‰πãËÄå‰∏çËÉΩÊ≠¢ÔºåÁî±‰∏çÁî®ÂäâÊõÑ‰πãË®àÔºå‰ª•Â§±Â∏≠Âç∑‰πãÊúÉÔºåÊñ§Áü≥Êó£Â∑ÆÔºåÊÇîÁÑ°ÊâÄÂèäÔºåÂç≥‰∫¶Ê≠§‰∫ã‰πãÈ°û‰πü„ÄÇ‰∏ñÂí∏Ë¨ÇÂäâË®àÁÇ∫ÊòØÔºåÂç≥ÊÑàË¶ãË≥àË®Ä‰πãÈùû‰πü„ÄÇ) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 10. =Advising Cao Cao during the Battle of Tong Pass= In 211,Zizhi Tongjian vol. 66. Cao Cao engaged a coalition of northwestern warlords led by Han Sui and Ma Chao at the Battle of Tong Pass. Ma Chao and others agreed to make peace with Cao Cao on two conditions. Firstly, Cao Cao had to give up the northwestern territories to them. Secondly, Cao Cao had to grant them official titles. Jia Xu suggested that Cao Cao pretend to agree to their terms, and then try to sow discord among them. Cao Cao heeded Jia Xu's advice.

Your Majesty has received the Mandate of Heaven in a timely fashion and now rules over the Empire. If you can promote civil culture while waiting for an opportunity to strike, it won't be difficult for you to conquer your enemies. Wu and Shu may be small and insignificant states, but they are shielded by natural geographical barriers such as mountains and rivers. Liu Bei has talent and great ambition; Zhuge Liang excels in statecraft; Sun Quan understands trends and sees through deception; Lu Yi assesses military power very well. They control geographically advantageous locations, and have set up defences at strategic points and the rivers and lakes. It is not easy to plan an attack. According to military strategy, you should gain the upper hand first before actually fighting a battle. You should assess the enemy's strength, and then decide which generals to send into battle. This is to ensure that you don't miscalculate. From my observation, none of our officials are capable of rivalling (Liu) Bei and (Sun) Quan. Even though you may fight a war with the prestige of an Emperor, you can't win without making significant losses. In the past, Shun ordered his troops to brandish their weapons to scare the Youmiao into submission.

His ancestor was Gongming (ÂÖ¨Êòé), the youngest son of Shuyu (a son of King Wu of Zhou). Gongming was enfeoffed by King Kang of Zhou as the Count of Jia (Ë≥à‰ºØ) and given the lands around Linfen as his fief, which was named \\"Jia\\". His descendants adopted \\"Jia\\" as their family name. Jia Yi, a notable scholar- politician who lived in the Western Han dynasty, was an ancestor of Jia Xu. Jia Xu's father, Jia Gong (Ë≥àÈæî), served as a General of Light Cavalry (ËºïÈ®éÂ∞áËªç) in the Eastern Han dynasty and moved his residence to Wuwei Commandery, where Jia Xu was born.

It is part of the Delta Park complex on the former site of Vanport, just south of the Columbia River. It lies west of a light rail station and less than a mile west of Interstate 5. The track hosts the IndyCar Series, ICSCC and SCCA and OMRRA road racing, the NASCAR K&N; Pro Series West, and SCCA autocross events. Additionally, the PIR grounds are host to OBRA (Oregon Bicycle Racing Association) bicycling races on the track and the surrounding grounds. The facility includes a dragstrip and a motocross track. Map of Portland International Raceway The road course is almost perfectly flat and runs clockwise. Two track configurations are possible. One includes a hard chicane at the end of the front straight and involves 12 turns at length of 1.945 miles (3.13 km). Without the chicane, the track has nine turns and a lap length of 1.915 miles (3.08 km). Portland is classified as an FIA Grade Two circuit. The City of Portland is working to establish the track as carbon neutral. History PIR is built on the former location of Vanport, Oregon, which was destroyed on Memorial Day, May 30, 1948, when a railroad berm broke and water from the Columbia River flooded the city. After the flood, all that remained were the paved streets and concrete foundations of destroyed buildings. The first races took place on these old city streets in 1961 during the Portland Rose Festival. Since then, the Rose Cup has become an annual event. Racing at \\"West Delta Park\\", as PIR was known back then, was quite dangerous. Racers leaving the track unexpectedly could collide with leftover concrete foundations or fall into ponds. Under the threat of losing the Rose Cup races, since many of the sanctioning racing bodies would no longer sanction races due to the deteriorating roads and dangerous obstacles, the track was finally paved in the 1970s. In 1975, Portland International hosted the Trans-Am Series, the premier series of the Sports Car Club of America, which was won by John Greenwood, driving a Chevrolet Corvette. Greenwood would go on to win the 1975 Trans-Am Series Championship. Beginning in 1984, Portland International began hosting the cars and stars of the Champ Car World Series, with Al Unser Jr. taking first win, driving a Cosworth powered March. In 1999 and 2000, the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series ran a race at Portland International Raceway. The race was added after the demise of the ¬Ω-mile Portland Speedway that hosted races early in the series. At the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, PIR went through a track renovation. The track was repaved with new asphalt and some minor changes were made to the track layout. Turns 4-7 were widened. The fence on the inside of turn 6 was moved to provide a better sightline through the corner. Turn 7 was sharpened to slow down racers prior to entering the back straight. Formula One-style curbs were also installed on the track. The track reopened on February 23, 2008, with a ribbon cutting ceremony. In September 2018, the Grand Prix of Portland returned after an 11-year hiatus.

She is an eccentric fashion designer renowned for designing the costumes of several famous superheroes, having worked particularly closely with Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl (Bob and Helen Parr), with whom she has maintained a strong friendship. When the couple resumes their superheroic careers after fifteen years, Edna is summoned out of retirement to aid both characters, first by equipping Mr. Incredible with a new costume and then by restoring Elastigirl's confidence in herself as a superheroine. Edna was created by screenwriter and director Brad Bird to explain how The Incredibles' superheroes obtain their costumes, a topic he believes is rarely explored in superhero films convincingly. Bird also decided to voice the character himself after several actresses originally considered for the role failed to replicate Edna's unique accent. The director understood that, in addition to fashion expertise, the character would need to demonstrate proficiency in science, engineering and technology in order to create costumes capable of withstanding the trials of superheroic activities, and ultimately conceived her as a short, confident character of both German and Japanese descent based on these countries' reputations as small yet powerful nations. Inspired by Q from the James Bond franchise, Edna is widely believed to have been based primarily on costume designer Edith Head, although there continues to be constant speculation as to which celebrities inspired Edna, particularly Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and actress Linda Hunt. Despite having only supporting roles in both films, Edna has since established herself as The Incredibles breakout character due to her popularity among fans. While film critics agree that Edna is a scene-stealer, particularly praising her humor and dialogue, Bird has also been lauded for his voice acting, earning an Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production for his performance as the character. Edna has been recognized as one of Pixar's greatest characters by several prominent media publications. Development =Creation and voice= leftEdna was created for The Incredibles by writer and director Brad Bird. Having watched several superhero-themed films and television shows prior to developing The Incredibles, Bird had often found himself wondering who is responsible for making the superheroes' elaborate costumes. Bird conceived Edna upon discovering that, despite featuring characters dressed in fancy, extravagant costumes, traditional superhero films rarely offer plausible explanations as to how superheroes come to obtain these outfits, or who provides them in the first place. The director wanted to debunk the trope of muscular superheroes sewing their own costumes, finding it hard to believe that superheroes would suddenly develop a strong enough interest in fashion and textiles to design their own outfits. Therefore, Bird decided that if the world was populated with superheroes, there would naturally also be people responsible for designing their costumes who must also have a background in science and engineering, thereby envisioning Edna as a scientist and technical genius in addition to being a fashion designer. The director elaborated, \\"The way I saw it, the costumes had to be created by somebody with a scientific and engineering background\\", thus conceiving Edna as \\"a half-German, half- Japanese, tiny powerhouse of a character\\". The Incredibles was the first Pixar film to earn a PG rating; Edna is considered to be one of the studio's earliest attempts at approaching \\"darker, edgier comedy,\\" which is particularly demonstrated by the scene in which the character cites several graphic examples of capes directly resulting in the deaths of several superheroes, one of whom is shown being consumed and killed by a jet turbine. According to Bird, the creation of Edna took the notion of superheroes wearing designed costumes \\"to a further extreme\\". Edna was named after EMode, a software Pixar used at the time the film was made. Bird identified Edna as the \\"most fun character\\" he had written for the film, recalling, \\"Any day that I was writing her, I was one happy camper.\\" Edna follows the tradition of having a director voice one of the film's secondary characters in animated films, which was based around Bird's \\"slave-driver voice\\" that he used during production. Bird's voice for the character originated during the story boarding process, during which various Pixar employees typically provide characters' voices temporarily while the filmmakers and animators organize the film's pacing and staging in order to \\"get a sense of the film.\\" Although these voices are usually eventually replaced by professional actors and voice actors, there are some situations in which \\"those voices stick\\", as was the case with the voice Bird had created for Edna. Bird had also provided the temporary voices of other characters during this time, including Bob Parr and Syndrome. Several actresses had been considered for the role; one actress, whom Bird is particularly fond of, constantly asked Bird to repeatedly demonstrate his interpretation of one of Edna's lines until telling him that he should simply voice the character himself since he \\"kind of got a beat on it\\". The role was also offered to actress and comedian Lily Tomlin, who was sent a tape recording of Bird recording Edna's part in its entirety; Tomlin declined upon hearing Bird's interpretation, feeling she could not voice the character as funnily as he did. Bird's colleagues had to heavily convince him to voice the character himself. Finally succumbing to \\"popular demand\\" from his fellow Pixar employees, Bird joked that he was ultimately cast as Edna simply because he was both affordable and available at the time. A similar tactic was used for several other supporting characters in the film: animator Bret Parker voices Kari, the Parr family's babysitter, writer Bud Luckey voices government agent Rick Dicker, and production designer Lou Romano voices Bernie Kropp, Dash's teacher. Bird described Edna's voice as a combination of a Japanese and German accent, deciding to draw influence from these countries because \\"they're two small countries that have amazing design and amazing technology\\", citing cameras and cars as examples of technology in which they specialize. Urban Cinefile's Louise Keller described the character's voice as \\"mid European ... complicated by an Asian touch\\". Although Bird's performance is considerably broad, he avoids allowing Edna to become too much of a caricature in order to maintain the illusion that she is one of the film's smartest characters. In the Italian and French-language versions of the film, Bird's comic accent is replaced by that of French-Italian entertainer Amanda Lear, who offers a more seductive, \\"biting\\" interpretation. Lear said that dubbing Edna's voice was not an easy process, but accepted the job after being offered the role upon seeing the film at the Cannes Film Festival in order to fulfill her dream of having always wanted to voice a Disney character. Edna was the first character Lear was hired to dub in Italian. =Personality, design and influences= Bird believes that he shares some of Edna's personality traits, specifically the way in which he prefers to be involved in virtually every creative aspect of his projects, including story boarding, writing and cinematography, admitting that he and his character demonstrate both a high level of self-confidence and lack of self-doubt when it comes to their own work. Bird elaborated that \\"At my most confident, I feel like her ... She is absolutely convinced that her way is the right way, and if you disagree ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre just wrong!‚Äù Bird identified Edna as one of the film's most difficult characters to design. The character went through several different changes in appearance during the development process, ranging from taller and overweight to older, younger and thinner. Inspired by the large impact that countries such as Japan and Germany have on the world despite being comparatively small in size, Bird decided that Edna would demonstrate this theme by being \\"a tiny character that dominates the room when she gets into it.\\" Her home, which uses high-end technology similar to what she incorporates into the outfits she creates, was deliberately designed to be significantly larger than she is to further emphasize this theme of dominance. Edna's small stature was also inspired by singer Bette Midler, of whom Bird has always been a fan. The director recalled being surprised by Midler's height when he first met her \\"Because ... she absolutely dominates the screen. And it just struck me how much personality was in this small body.\\" In terms of animation, Bird wanted all of the film's characters to move differently from each other, providing Edna with a very confident walk to represent the fact that she has \\"never experienced doubt in her life.\\" The animators found the fact that Bird provided the character's voice himself to be very helpful as he would often act out the way in which the character acts and behaves himself, which helped in further defining the animator's vision of Edna. According to Bird, Edna, despite her petite stature, is the only non-superhero in The Incredibles capable of making superheroes feel uncomfortable. Bird described Edna as a character who is \\"not remotely intimidated by superheroes or anyone\\", refusing to accept the word \\"no\\" when it is used in opposition of her opinions or beliefs. Describing Edna's physical attributes as \\"severe\\", Bird had envisioned the character having glasses and a pageboy haircut, while still wanting her to appear modern and elegant at the same time. Edna's ethnicity has been identified as half-German and half-Japanese. Both Edna's physical appearance and voice are widely believed to have based on those of costume designer Edith Head, with whom she shares her signature round glasses and black bob cut. According to Head's entry in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the character is inspired by both the costume designer's signature glasses and \\"forthright personality\\". Bird described Edna as a combination of both Head and Q, a character featured in the James Bond franchise. The director has generally declined to confirm any direct influences on the character, insisting that Edna is \\"not based on a specific person\\", including publicly refuting claims that he based the character on Head, although she continues to be considered the character's \\"most legitimate\\" alleged inspiration. However, animator Teddy Newton, who co- designed Edna with Bird, revealed that he and Pixar were inspired by the film Unzipped (1995), a documentary depicting the petulance of fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi and stylist Polly Allen Mellen. Fans have long speculated about the real-life inspiration behind Edna's design and appearance. Bird stated he has constantly been told by various fans and viewers that the character reminds them of at least 15 different celebrities since the character debuted in The Incredibles. Contributing to Fashion, Erin Dunlop described the character as \\"a supercharged hybrid of every fashion industry legend we can think of\\". In an article discussing who Edna is based on, Entertainment Weekly's Steve Daly cited Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, designer Coco Chanel and actress Lotte Lenya as possible influences, while drawing similarities between the character's use of large-framed glasses to architect Philip Johnson, producer Robert Evans, talent agent Swifty Lazar, studio executive Lew Wasserman, and fashion editor Carrie Donovan. Some critics have suspected that the character is also based on Mary Quant and Una Jones. Acknowledging that there are several female fashion designers who wear glasses upon whom Edna could have been based, Bird admitted that the character was inspired by author Patricia Highsmith and actress Linda Hunt, elaborating: \\"When you're designing a character, you're just saying - who is that? ... We tried a lot of stuff and we kept saying no, no, more like this, but I like the nose on this one, and maybe the pageboy cut, maybe glasses should be bigger ... and you end up with something that reminds you of Edith Head and Linda Hunt.\\" For the sequel, shading art director Bryn Imagire decided to incorporate more of Edna's Japanese heritage into her two new costumes, basing them on the work of Japanese costume designers Rei Kawakubo, Eiko Ishioka and Chitose Abe. Imagire was particularly inspired by Kawakubo's quote, \\"For something to be beautiful, it doesn‚Äôt have to be pretty,‚Äù and opting to envision Edna's outfits \\"more as abstract sculpture\\" as opposed to forms of clothing. In order to design costumes for a fictional character who also happens to be a designer in her own film, Imagire drew upon lessons she had learned while attending art school, describing Edna's style as \\"very to the point and very specific\\" while imagining what the character might be thinking while designing her clothes. Meanwhile, character artist Deanna Marsigliese's first assignment was to create an entire line of clothing designed by Edna, for which she was tasked with \\"thinking like Edna\\". Although ultimately the completed clothing line does not appear in the final film, Marsigliese considered the experience to be \\" a study in (Edna's) character\\" nonetheless, during which she drew inspiration from Edna's appearance and wardrobe in the first film, from her dress to the interior of her house. Although she was aware that Edna enjoys being dramatic, she acknowledge that \\"fashion designers don‚Äôt necessarily design things that they would wear on their person, they design for their models\\", meaning, \\"Their aesthetic is oftentimes different.‚Äù Similarly, Imagire agreed that fashion designers such as Kawakubo, Ishioka and Abe \\"always looked really comfortable in contrast to what they were creating for their models\\", a contrast that she wanted to incorporate into the character. Recalling that Edna dislikes models, the artist envisioned that the character would instead design her own clothing to serve as \\"a vehicle to celebrate superheroes and her powers.\\" Inspired by Italian fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, Marsigliese created a \\"classic, mid-century inspired silhouette\\" for Edna's costumes that were also bold and dramatic as though Edna herself had designed them, then rearranging the designs to ultimately give them a more surreal, specific appearance. Dubbing the character a \\"woman of the now\\", Marsigliese explained that, like Schiaparelli, Edna is \\"completely ahead of her time\\" despite living in the 1950s; \\"she used a lot of surrealist elements, a lot of fun surprises, and that was very inspiring for me.‚Äù Imagire designed approximately 25 potential costumes for Edna, 15 of which she showed to Bird before the final two were decided upon: a simple indigo dress and black-and-red kimono. Characterization According to Matthew Brunson of Creative Loafing, Edna provides the majority of the film's comic relief. Hischak believes that Edna offers \\"a whole new viewpoint to the world of superheroes\\", in addition to demonstrating the film's \\"oddball silliness\\". Vogue Italia published a biography of Edna, in which author Valentina Fabbri described her as a character who \\"knows she‚Äôs the best and she doesn‚Äôt hide it, and her lack of modesty is equalled only by her intuition\\", with whom it is virtually impossible to have a conversation because \\"she tends to dominate.\\" Due to her combination of genius-level intellect and \\"craziness,\\" Fabbri identified Edna as \\"a fun, bubbly caricature of the magicians of fashion\\" by \\"embod[ying] their talent and charisma, their vices and virtues.\\" Screen Rant's Victoria Robertson observed that the character \\"has a lot of personality packed into a small exterior, taking stereotypical traits often attributed to designers and making them her own\\", firstly remaining proud of her own work at all times. Oliver Lyttelton of IndieWire identified Edna as quite possibly the film's most intelligent character. Edna's criticisms of fashion can come off as unpleasant at times, but are exaggerated to the point of which audiences find them to be comical. Edna prefers to always think about the future, finding dwelling on the past to be distracting from the present, as demonstrated by her line \\"I never look back, dahling, it distracts from the now\\", and thus has proven capable of determining the needs of her superhero clientele before they have the opportunity to finalize their ideas themselves. Her personality has been described by GamesRadar+'s Joshua Winning as \\"brassy\\" and \\"no-nonsense\\". Q13 Fox described Edna as \\"a gifted designer, an assertive life coach and a witty talker,\\" using her mind and intelligence as a means of solving everyday issues. BuddyTV believes that the character's \\"bold and eccentric attitude\\" is rivaled only by her considerable talent. According to Kevin Carr of Film School Rejects, Edna \\"doesn‚Äôt take crap from anyone\\" yet \\"she does so with poise and pride.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle's Carla Meyer argues that Edna is \\"more a caricature than a character.\\" Actress Linda Hunt, one of the celebrities to whom Edna's appearance has constantly been compared and often believed to have been based on.Scott Tobias of Rolling Stone called Edna \\"a reminder that the superhero suit needs to the perfect synthesis of form and function\\", without which \\"greatness as both a crimefighter and an icon is impossible.\\" According to Thomas S. Hischak, author of 100 Greatest American and British Animated Films, Edna is just as concerned with the appearance of the costumes she designs as she is about their use and practicality, proving capable of designing outfits that can stretch, change their shape and resist oncoming attacks such as missiles and fires. The character proves capable of designing a costume for Violet that is capable of becoming invisible whenever its wearer does. She absolutely refuses to incorporate capes into her new designs due to the accessory having a history of contributing to the deaths of superheroes in the past, among them Dynaguy, Thunderhead, Stratogale, Meta-Man and Splashdown, presenting them as a \\"montage of superhero couture faux-pas\\". Ultimately, her knowledge of the dangers of capes results in the death of the film's villain Syndrome. In terms of her own appearance, Edna is costumed in \\"futuristic black\\" attire, wearing a black dress that boasts square lines. Estimating her height to be of approximately three feet, The Tyee's Dorothy Woodend wrote that Edna is dressed in Issey Miyake pleats while being of \\"indeterminate gender\\". VPRO drew similarities between the character's hairstyle and personality to that of Vogue editor Anna Wintour, the resemblance to whom Tech Times' Katherine Derla identified as \\"The first thing viewers are likely to remember upon seeing\\" the character. According to STATUS magazine, Edna is often mistaken for the magazine editor largely due to her \\"snappy sass and iconic bob\\". Film's Angie Han joked that Edna's \\"no-nonsense demeanor\\" would leave Wintour \\"quaking in her Chanel boots.\\" When asked about the alleged similarities between her and the character, Wintour revealed that she has yet to see the film. Derla also wrote that Edna is capable of \\"run[ing] the world\\" but opts to operate from behind the scenes instead. The term \\"diminutive\\" is often used to describe the character's height. Considering herself to be \\"too talented\\" to design clothes for normal humans, Edna resents having been forced to resort to designing clothes for supermodels during the 15-year-long absence of superheroes, dismissing them as \\"Spoiled, stupid little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves\\", an opinion she formed after being forced to work with such individuals in Milan and Paris. Edna believes that designing clothes for superheroes is similar to designing for gods, and thus considers herself to be far superior to other fashion designers. Despite her considerable success as one of the world's top fashion designers internationally, Edna longs to return to working with superheroes so that she can challenge her designs by \\"fus[ing] the latest technology with her impeccable fashion sense\\" to the public's amusement, who continue to adore both her and her creations, insisting that there is nothing \\"super\\" about supermodels. Despite designing elaborate costumes for a living, Edna prefers a more simple aesthetic for herself, generally avoiding nail polish and accessories. Racked's Carlye Wisel observed that although the sequel \\"may have deep roots in midcentury-modern design ... Edna remains true to her forward-looking style, wearing a red silk kimono as well as an asymmetrical sheath that feels like yet another nod to Kawakubo‚Äôs work.\\" In addition to being a talented fashion designer, Edna has also demonstrated proficiency in psychology. In addition to designing their clothes, she offers advice to her clients whenever she feels that they require it, demonstrating a \\"zero-tolerance policy for emotional weakness\\" which, according to The Dissolve's Charles Bramesco, represents Bird's \\"lament[ing] regular folks‚Äô tendency to impede awesome people from being awesome.\\" Edna is known for her tendency to refer to her cohorts as \\"dahling\\", while her colleagues affectionately refer to her as \\"E\\". In addition to citing her resemblance to Wintour, journalist Hadley Freeman of The Guardian believes that Edna's use of fashion in the film represents \\"The highest pinnacle of human achievement. Without them the world would come to an end.\\" Appearances Edna first appears in The Incredibles as a fashion designer to superheroes and close friend of the titular characters. During the ‚Äúgolden age of superheroes\\", Edna is one of a few elite guests who attend the private wedding ceremony of Bob and Helen Parr, then better-known to the public as the superheroes Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl. After all superheroes have been outlawed and forced to retire following a series of lawsuits, forcing Edna to retire from superhero work due to government restrictions, Edna does not appear again until approximately midway through film when she is unexpectedly visited by Bob who has resumed superhero work undercover, a secret he keeps from his family. Bob initially asks Edna to simply repair his original super suit, but she ultimately convinces him to allow her to design an entirely new outfit on the condition that capes not be incorporated whatsoever due to safety concerns, ultimately ending her 15 years-long retirement from superhero work. Helen soon discovers that Bob's original super suit had received a patch job, determining that the only person capable of repairing a super suit would be Edna and growing more suspicious of Bob's actions. Later in the film, Helen visits Edna in the hopes of finding out more information about Bob's whereabouts, discovering that she had taken the liberty of designing a complete matching set of super suits for his family. Although their reunion is brief, Edna provides an initially distraught Helen with the encouragement she needs to resume her identity as Elastigirl in order to save her husband (and their marriage), in addition to introducing the character to the homing device she had implanted in her husband's suit, intentionally revealing his exact location to her. Edna appears in the film's sequel, Incredibles 2 (2018). When Helen is recruited by a pair of entrepreneurs to change the public's perception of superheroes and thus returns to work to fight crime as Elastigirl, Edna is upset to learn that Elastigirl's costume has been designed by a rival designer. Bob soon becomes overwhelmed by Jack-Jack's emerging superpowers, and recruits Edna for assistance with controlling him. Although Edna is initially reluctant to babysit Jack-Jack, she soon develops a strong liking for the baby and she is willing to babysit him overnight free of charge; during this time, she upgrades his suit with sensors and a remote control so that the family can monitor his powers and rein them in as needed. She gives the enhanced suit to Bob in a custom shopping bag, which bears a logo for her services that incorporates her signature eyeglasses into its lettering. Edna also appears in Disney on Ice's adaptation of the film: The Incredibles in a Magic Kingdom Adventure. The time that Edna spends looking after Jack-Jack is the focus of the animated short Auntie Edna. Critical reception The public was immediately captivated by Edna upon her debut, becoming particularly enamored with the character's combination of irreverence and sulkiness. Edna instantly established herself as a fan favorite when the film was released in 2004, which Racked's Carlye Wisel has attributed to the character's combination of wit and style. Several critics have referred to Edna as a scene-stealing character; Fashion magazine's Erin Dunlop crowned Edna \\"the undisputed scene-stealer of\\" the film. Dubbing her \\"One of the great scene-stealing characters in The Incredibles\\", HowStuffWorks contributor Vicki Arkoff called Edna \\"deliciously deadpan\\". Ken Hanke, writing for the Mountain Xpress, considers Edna to be among the film's gags and characters who \\"are delightful and very funny\\", particularly highlighting the character's anti- cape monologue while deeming her \\"worth the price of admission\\". Film critic Peter Bradshaw, contributing to The Irish Times, described Edna as \\"a joy with her wonderful and appropriate maxim: 'I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now.'\\" Dorothy Woodend, writing for The Tyee, praised Edna as \\"a more interesting creature than all the Incredibles put together.\\" Describing her as \\"a personage I'd like to see more of\\", Woodend continued that the character \\"steals the show, and does fabulous things with it, darling.\\" Referred to as one of the film's \\"high point[s]\\", Kevin Lally of Film Journal International described the character's anti-cape montage as \\"pricelessly funny\\", a sentiment with which Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing agreed. The National Post described Edna as \\"exactly the kind of person you want at your dinner party\\". Notable Biographies identified Edna as \\"one of the audience's favorite characters\\". Bird has also garnered critical acclaim for his performance. Nell Minow of Common Sense Media wrote that Bird \\"plays the funniest character in the film\\", while AllMovie's Perry Seibert described his performance as \\"screamingly funny\\". Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat wrote that Bird contributes \\"the best work\\" to the film as Edna in terms of dialogue and vocal performance, calling her rant about the \\"idiocy\\" of capes \\"priceless.\\" Scott Chitwood, writing for ComingSoon.net, agreed that Bird is \\" absolutely hilarious as Edna\\". Empire's Colin Kennedy dubbed Bird's voice work \\"an unmistakable highlight\\". BBC's Stella Papamichael agreed that the director \\"steals the show\\" as Edna. Carla Meyer, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, wrote that Bird's performance as Edna \\"shows his versatility\\". In 2005, Bird won an Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production at the 32nd Annie Awards for his performance as Edna, in addition to being rewarded for writing and directing the film. Bird was rewarded over actor Samuel L. Jackson, who had been nominated in the same category for his role as Frozone. Wisel appreciated Edna's cameo in the sequel, describing it as \\"perfect in its restraint.\\" Vulture.com ranked Bird's role as Edna the fourth greatest performance in an animated film, calling it \\"a scene- and movie-stealing performance\\". Similarly, Entertainment Weekly placed Edna fourth on their ranking of \\"The 10 greatest Pixar voice performances\\", with author Marc Snetiker calling it \\"an all-too-short but memorably delicious appearance\\" in which Bird \\"left an indelible mark on his own universe\\". Snetiker called the character \\"overwhelmingly funny thanks to Bird‚Äôs unrestrained efforts on even the simplest lines.\\" IndieWire ranked Bird's performance as Edna the 14th \\"30 Best Voice Performances In Pixar Movies\\". Kiko Martinez of the San Antonio Current found Bird's performance to be worthy of an Academy Award, ranking him among \\"15 Actors Who Should‚Äôve Won an Oscar for Their Voice Work\\". Bird revealed that fans tend to be more impressed by the fact that he provides Edna's voice than his success as a director and writer, explaining, \\"If I say a line in Edna‚Äôs voice, that‚Äôs far more delightful than the fact that I spent four years wrestling something into being.\\" Impact and legacy Edna's popularity among audiences established her as the film's breakout character. Screen Rant's Alex Welch attributes this designation to both her comedic rapport with the titular family and passion for superhero costumes. Gregory E. Miller of the New York Post cited Edna's impact since The Incredibles as significant despite her relatively brief appearance, while HelloGiggles writer Sydney Bucksbaum crowned her the film's \\"real hero\\". Vogue Italia contributor Valentina Fabbri wrote that Edna ended the trope of \\"superheroes [dressed] in homemade outfits\\". According to Fabbri, Edna is one of Pixar's most beloved characters, while Hollywood.com's Julia Emmanuele dubbed her \\"one of the most memorable Pixar characters of all time\\" who has ultimately \\"become the film‚Äôs enduring legacy\\", despite her supporting role. Uproxx contributor Donna Dickens wrote that the character \\"went down in pop culture history\\" from the moment she uttered \\"No capes!‚Äù Media publications consistently rank Edna among Pixar's greatest characters. In their article \\"Top 10 Pixar Movie Characters\\", Tech Times ranked Edna seventh. IGN ranked Edna eighth in their countdown of the \\"Top 10 Pixar Characters\\", calling her \\"a pint-sized fashionista\\" with \\"a flair that only a superhero could truly appreciate.\\" Rolling Stone placed her ninth on the website's list of the \\"25 Best Pixar Movie Characters\\", ranking her ahead of Mr. Incredible (24th), Violet Parr (20th) and Elastigirl (14th). Contributor Scott Tobias wrote that the character \\"stops the action cold just to have a sequence about appropriate action-wear for the specially abled, culminating in a brilliant screed on the impracticality of capes.\\" Including Edna among the studio's 20 best characters, Victoria Robertson of Screen Rant cited her as \\"proof of how important even the most minor characters in a film can be.\\" GamesRadar+ included Edna among Pixar's \\"50 Greatest Pixar Characters Of All Time\\", with author George Wales crowning her \\"One of Pixar's finest comic creations\\". Additionally, the same publication ranked Edna among Pixar's 12 greatest supporting characters. D23.com recognized Edna as one of Pixar's \\"23 Favorite ... Supporting Characters\\", deeming her \\"An icon in her own right\\". /Film ranked Edna Pixar's sixth best female character, crowning her \\"the wisest character in the entire Incredibles universe\\" due to her anti-cape stance, which author Angie Han has described as the film's \\"most valuable piece of advice\\". The Odyssey Online published an article discussing \\"Why Edna Mode Is The Disney Heroine We Never Knew We Needed\\", in which author Erin Farmer dubbed her \\"the real heroine of the Disney Franchise\\" while comparing her motivational speeches to those of Mahatma Gandhi. GamesRadar+ ranked Edna's introductory scene the 12th best moment in a Pixar film, deeming her \\"the perfect embodiment of the film's tongue-in-cheek approach to realism\\". Entertainment Weekly ranked Edna's anti-capes speech the 12th best Pixar moment. In 2015, E! ranked Edna 10th on their list of \\"11 Forgotten Disney Characters Who Should Totally Be Your Favorites\\". In 2015, Empire ranked the character the hundredth greatest film character of all-time. In 2013, Screen Rant crowned Edna \\"The world‚Äôs greatest fashion designer\\". Fashion ranked Edna among the magazine's \\"10 coolest fashion industry pros\\". In their \\"critical assessment of 7 fictional fashion designers\\", Mary Sollosi of Entertainment Weekly wrote that she is \\"consistently impressed by Ms. Mode‚Äôs truly groundbreaking textile work\\" despite feeling that she tends to limit herself to familiar silhouettes, joking, \\"we are perplexed by her stubborn refusal to incorporate new design features ‚Äî most notably capes.\\" In June 2018, Carlye Wisel of Racked crowned Edna \\"Film‚Äôs greatest fashion character\\", deeming her \\"the best fictional fashion personality ever to exist, animated or not\\". She prefers her over The Devil Wears Prada's Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), insisting that Edna \\"feels more grounded and true\\" than Miranda, a fictional magazine editor who is frequently touted the \\"best-ever fashion character\\". Describing her as \\"effortless and memorable,\\" Wisel concluded, \\"at a time when a label like Gucci is exploding its brand with misspellings and magpie tendencies to draw attention, she remains classic. Edna is never anything but fully herself ‚Äî all hair, accent, and attitude.\\" Edna's catchphrase against using capes in superhero costumes has become one of the most popular phrases among superhero fans. Edna has become so popular that fans have begun to demand a spin-off film revolving around the character. Screen Rant ranked Edna the third Pixar heroine who deserves her own film, with author Wednesday Lee Friday writing, \\"There are so many things Pixar could do with Edna, she might be worthy of a trilogy.\\" At the 77th Academy Awards in 2005, Edna presented the Academy Award for Best Costume Design alongside actor Pierce Brosnan. In 2013, the D23 Expo hosted its first official cosplay competition, naming it \\"Heroes and Villains √† la Mode\\" in honor of Edna; contestants competed in five categories, with the winners being awarded miniature statuettes of the character. To promote the film's sequel in which Edna appeared, Disney released a mockumentary-style teaser trailer that features various celebrities involved in the fashion industry paying tribute to Edna and describing ways in which the character has influenced them over the years ever since she decided to venture into haute couture. Disney revealed the trailer at the D23 Expo in 2017. Fashion models Heidi Klum, Kendall Jenner and Rachel Zoe are among the celebrities who speak about Edna's influence on the fashion industry. Impressed by their commitment to pretending Edna is real, Halle Kiefer of Vulture.com joked that the tribute features some of the participants' \\"most impressive onscreen roles to date\\". Rachel Kolb of Uproxx wrote that having Edna design new costumes for the family in Incredibles 2 would be one way to ensure that the sequel is better than the original. Beginning in 2018, Edna has been used heavily in Incredibles 2's first advertising campaign. In February 2018, the character's likeness was used heavily on several bus and subway posters within Manhattan, New York surrounding New York Fashion Week. Disney-Pixar's announced on their Twitter account: \\"If you thought she‚Äôd miss #NYFW, you thought wrong, dahling\\". The poster features a black and white closeup image of the character with only her lips colored red, accompanied by the caption \\"It's been too long, dahlings.\\" Bucksbaum called the poster \\"stunning\\".

A controversial product of the Civil War and in effect only until 1867, when the state's present constitution was adopted, the 1864 document was short-lived. Drafting The 1864 constitution was largely the product of strong Unionists, who had control of the state at the time. The document outlawed slavery, disenfranchised Southern sympathizers, and reapportioned the General Assembly based upon the number of white inhabitants. This provision further diminished the power of the small counties where the majority of the state's large former slave population lived. One of the framers' goals was to reduce the influence of Southern sympathizers, who had almost caused the state to secede in 1861. Ratification The convention which drafted the document convened on April 27, 1864 and completed their work by September 6. The constitution was then submitted to the people for ratification on October 13, 1864. It was approved by a vote of 30,174 to 29,799 (50.31% to 49.69%). This was a very controversial result, since the state, though part of the Union, still had many Confederate ties and sympathies. The tally of those voting at their usual polling places was opposed to this Constitution by 29,536 to 27,541. However, the constitution secured ratification after the soldiers' votes were tallied. Soldiers from Maryland serving in the Union Army voted overwhelmingly in favor, 2,633 to 263. Notable features By design, the constitution disenfranchised those Marylanders who had left the state to fight for or live in the Confederacy or who had given it \\"any aid, comfort, countenace, or support.\\" It also made it difficult for them to regain the full rights of citizenship and required office-holders to take a new oath of allegiance to support the state and union and to repudiate the rebellion. Furthermore, the influence of the small counties which had large slave populations, and tended to have supported secession and to have opposed Union efforts during the war, was reduced by basing representation solely on white population. The constitution did emancipate the slaves, but this did not mean equality. The franchise was restricted to \\"white\\" males. Additionally, the Maryland legislature refused to ratify both the 14th Amendment, which conferred citizenship rights on former slaves, and the 15th Amendment, which gave the vote to African Americans. Maryland's 1864 constitution created for the first time the position of Lieutenant Governor. The office was held by only one person, Christopher C. Cox, until a 1971 amendment to the 1867 constitution re-created the position. References *Whitman H. Ridgway. Maryland Humanities Council (2001). \\"(Maryland) Politics and Law\\" *Whitman H.

The limit cycle begins as circle and, with varying Œº, become increasingly sharp. An example of a Relaxation oscillator. In dynamics, the Van der Pol oscillator is a non-conservative oscillator with non-linear damping. It evolves in time according to the second-order differential equation: :{d^2x \\\\over dt^2}-\\\\mu(1-x^2){dx \\\\over dt}+x= 0, where x is the position coordinate‚Äîwhich is a function of the time t, and Œº is a scalar parameter indicating the nonlinearity and the strength of the damping. History The Van der Pol oscillator was originally proposed by the Dutch electrical engineer and physicist Balthasar van der Pol while he was working at Philips.Cartwright, M.L., \\"Balthazar van der Pol\\", J. London Math. Soc., 35, 367‚Äì376, (1960). Van der Pol found stable oscillations,B. van der Pol: \\"A theory of the amplitude of free and forced triode vibrations\\", Radio Review (later Wireless World) 1 701‚Äì710 (1920) which he subsequently called relaxation-oscillationsVan der Pol, B., \\"On relaxation-oscillations\\", The London, Edinburgh and Dublin Phil. Mag. & J. of Sci., 2(7), 978‚Äì992 (1926). and are now known as a type of limit cycle in electrical circuits employing vacuum tubes. When these circuits were driven near the limit cycle, they become entrained, i.e. the driving signal pulls the current along with it. Van der Pol and his colleague, van der Mark, reported in the September 1927 issue of NatureVan der Pol, B. and Van der Mark, J., ‚ÄúFrequency demultiplication‚Äù, Nature, 120, 363‚Äì364, (1927). that at certain drive frequencies an irregular noise was heard, which was later found to be the result of deterministic chaos.Kanamaru, T., \\"Van der Pol oscillator\\", Scholarpedia, 2(1), 2202, (2007). The Van der Pol equation has a long history of being used in both the physical and biological sciences. For instance, in biology, FitzhughFitzHugh, R., ‚ÄúImpulses and physiological states in theoretical models of nerve membranes‚Äù, Biophysics J, 1, 445‚Äì466, (1961). and NagumoNagumo, J., Arimoto, S. and Yoshizawa, S. \\"An active pulse transmission line simulating nerve axon\\", Proc. IRE, 50, 2061‚Äì2070, (1962). extended the equation in a planar field as a model for action potentials of neurons. The equation has also been utilised in seismology to model the two plates in a geological fault,Cartwright, J., Eguiluz, V., Hernandez-Garcia, E. and Piro, O., \\"Dynamics of elastic excitable media\\", Internat. J. Bifur. Chaos Appl. Sci. Engrg., 9, 2197‚Äì2202, (1999). and in studies of phonation to model the right and left vocal fold oscillators.  Two-dimensional form  Li√©nard's theorem can be used to prove that the system has a limit cycle. Applying the Li√©nard transformation y = x - x^3/3 - \\\\dot x/\\\\mu, where the dot indicates the time derivative, the Van der Pol oscillator can be written in its two-dimensional form:Kaplan, D. and Glass, L., Understanding Nonlinear Dynamics, Springer, 240‚Äì244, (1995). :\\\\dot x = \\\\mu \\\\left(x-\\\\tfrac{1}{3}x^3-y\\\\right) :\\\\dot y = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu} x. Another commonly used form based on the transformation y = \\\\dot x leads to: :\\\\dot x = y :\\\\dot y = \\\\mu(1-x^2) y-x. Results for the unforced oscillator Relaxation oscillation in the Van der Pol oscillator without external forcing. The nonlinear damping parameter is equal to Œº = 5\\\\. Two interesting regimes for the characteristics of the unforced oscillator are:Grimshaw, R., Nonlinear ordinary differential equations, CRC Press, 153‚Äì163, (1993), . * When Œº = 0, i.e. there is no damping function, the equation becomes: ::{d^2x \\\\over dt^2}+x= 0. :This is a form of the simple harmonic oscillator, and there is always conservation of energy. * When Œº > 0, the system will enter a limit cycle. Near the origin x = dx/dt = 0, the system is unstable, and far from the origin, the system is damped. * Van der Pol oscillator doesn't have an exact, analytic solution.Panayotounakos, D. E., Panayotounakou, N. D., & Vakakis, A. F. (2003). On the lack of analytic solutions of the Van der Pol oscillator. ZAMM‚ÄêJournal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics/Zeitschrift f√ºr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik: Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, 83(9), 611‚Äì615. Such a solution does exist for the limit cycle if f(x) in the Lienard equation is a constant piece-wise function. Hamiltonian for Van der Pol oscillator One can also write a time-independent Hamiltonian formalism for the Van der Pol oscillator by augmenting it to a four-dimensional autonomous dynamical system using an auxiliary second-order nonlinear differential equation as follows: :\\\\ddot{x}-\\\\mu(1-x^2)\\\\dot{x}+x=0, :\\\\ddot{y}+\\\\mu(1-x^2)\\\\dot{y}+y=0. Note that the dynamics of the original Van der Pol oscillator is not affected due to the one-way coupling between the time-evolutions of x and y variables. A Hamiltonian H for this system of equations can be shown to be :H(x,y,p_x,p_y)=p_xp_y+xy-\\\\mu(1-x^2)yp_y, where p_x=\\\\dot{y} + \\\\mu(1-x^2)y and p_y=\\\\dot{x} are the conjugate momenta corresponding to x and y, respectively. This may, in principle, lead to quantization of the Van der Pol oscillator. Such a Hamiltonian also connects the geometric phase of the limit cycle system having time dependent parameters with the Hannay angle of the corresponding Hamiltonian system. Forced Van der Pol oscillator Chaotic behaviour in the Van der Pol oscillator with sinusoidal forcing. The nonlinear damping parameter is equal to Œº = 8.53, while the forcing has amplitude A = 1.2 and angular frequency œâ = 2œÄ / 10. The forced, or driven, Van der Pol oscillator takes the 'original' function and adds a driving function Asin(œât) to give a differential equation of the form: :{d^2x \\\\over dt^2}-\\\\mu(1-x^2){dx \\\\over dt}+x-A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)= 0, where A is the amplitude, or displacement, of the wave function and œâ is its angular velocity.

The Mercedes-Benz W125 Rekordwagen was an experimental, high-speed automobile produced in the late 1930s. The streamlined car was derived from the 1937 open-wheel race car Mercedes-Benz W125 Formel-Rennwagen, of which also a streamlined version was raced at the non-championship Avusrennen in Berlin. The main difference to the Grand Prix race car, which had to adhere to the limit, was the engine. While the GP car had the 8-cylinder inline M125, which was rather tall, the record car was fitted with a V12 engine that was lower, which reduced drag. The car is on display in the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart.  1938 Mercedes-Benz W125 specifications  * Engine: MD 25 DAB/3 60 Degree V12 * Engine position: Front longitudinal * Aspiration: Twin Roots superchargers * Valvetrain: DOHC 4 valves per cylinder * Displacement: 5,576.75 cc / 340.31 in¬≥ (82.0 x 88.0 mm) * Compression: 9.17:1 * Power: @ 5800 rpm * Power/displacement per litre * Power/weight: per tonne * Transmission: 4-speed manual * Engine cooling: Ice supplemented normal coolant as air intakes were kept very small to improve aerodynamic flow over and around the car  The record  Rudolf Caracciola's record of 432.7 km/h (268 mph) over the flying kilometre on 28 January 1938, remained the fastest ever officially timed speed on a public road until broken on 5 November 2017 by Koenigsegg in an Agera RS driven by Niklas Lilja, achieving 445.6 km/h (276.9 mph) on a closed highway in Nevada. It also was the fastest speed ever recorded in Germany until Rico Anthes bested it with a Top Fuel Dragster on the Hockenheimring drag strip. This record breaking run was made on the Reichs-Autobahn A5 between Frankfurt and Darmstadt, where onlookers were rattled by the brutal boom of the side spewing exhaust stacks as the silver car hurtled past. By nine that morning, Caracciola and team chief Alfred Neubauer were having a celebration breakfast at the Park Hotel in Frankfurt. Popular driver Bernd Rosemeyer was killed later the same day when trying to beat that record for Auto Union. This also put an end to the record attempts of Mercedes, even though Hans Stuck later wanted to beat the overall land speed record with the Porsche-designed Mercedes-Benz T80 which was powered by a airplane engine.  Porsche Rekordwagen  In 1937, Joseph Mickl the chief R&D; engineer of Porsche filed a patent for a high speed vehicle, which made use of a wide range of techniques making it most probably the most advanced vehicle of its kind for that time. This patent, is considered as the successor of the w125 Rekordwagen . It is possible to identify many features on this patented design that spun out of the research work of famous researchers of that time such as Ludwig Prandtl, Wunibald Kamm, Theodore von K√°rm√°n etc. The streamlined, low drag body of the vehicle is equipped with an air inlet for the engine which is conveniently located at the maximum static pressure region at the \\"nose\\". The body completely engulfs the wheels thus eliminating their additional aerodynamic drag. The vehicle is equipped with 6 wheels (occurring long before the Tyrrell P34 of the late 70s). The main reason for that design choice is the maximization of the contact area with the ground with a simultaneous reduction of the frontal area of the vehicle (i.e. low drag). At the same time the rear wheel axles could remain lower thus reducing the frontal area as well as the center of gravity of the vehicle. The body of the vehicle is formed like a very basic diffuser thus using the Bernoulli principle in order to create downforce and improve stability and traction at high speeds. This may be one of the first uses of the Ground Effect, decades before it appeared on the BRM and Chaparral Formula One racers of the 60s. Another great innovation of that design/patent of Mickl was the integration of an inverted wing which was responsible for the creation of downforce, thus increasing the stability of the vehicle. Most of the people believe that the use of wings to create downforce on vehicles is an idea of the 1960s pioneered by Colin Chapman and his Lotus 49 racer. However, the truth is that the German rocket powered rail-racer of the late 1920s Opel-RAK.3 was the earliest example of a vehicle equipped with wings creating downforce. This vehicle, however, did not use inverted wings but rather normal wings that were pitched to a negative angle of attack such that they would generate \\"negative lift\\". The racer of Mickl, however, employs an inverted wing, located directly on top of the rear wheel axles and in the \\"clean\\" air inflow stream in order to produce downforce and to translate it directly to tire traction at high speeds. The inverted wing was even equipped with a large aileron, such that the driver could adjust the generated downforce in such a way that the vehicle could achieve high traction during the acceleration phase and low drag (i.e. low downforce) during the high-speed phase of the race. A further invention was presented with the implementation of an airbrake option. In this case the aileron of the wing would deflect almost 90¬∞ thus hugely increasing drag and acting as a high speed air brake. That action could be manually controlled by the driver via a separate air-brake lever or could be coupled to the wheel brake system of the vehicle.

After his departure from the band in 1993, Kiske recorded four solo albums, participated on various metal and rock related projects, such as Avantasia, Place Vendome and Kiske/Somerville, while he also performed with numerous bands as a guest vocalist. In late 2009, he formed the hard rock band Unisonic and began touring again after 17 years of absence. In October 2017, Kiske joined Helloween and Kai Hansen for the Pumpkins United World Tour that continued through 2018. A live recording of the Helloween tour entitled United Alive and United Alive in Madrid was released in 2019 and a new Helloween album with Kiske and Hansen is planned for 2021. Biography = Early life = Prior to joining Helloween, Kiske sang with the German band Ill Prophecy at the age of 17. The band recorded a demo, but it was never released commercially. =Helloween (1986‚Äì1993, 2017‚Äìpresent)= Michael Kiske live with Helloween in 2018 At the age of eighteen, Kiske was asked to join the German power metal band Helloween, which was fronted by singer/guitarist Kai Hansen. Hansen had some difficulties being both the lead guitarist and lead vocalist, and it was decided that a new vocalist would be needed. Kiske rejected Helloween's first offer, because he disliked the sound of the band's Walls of Jericho album, but accepted the second and joined Helloween in late 1986. Michael's first album with the band was 1987's Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I, widely considered to be one of Helloween's best albums and a milestone in the creation of the power metal genre. The album's worldwide success enabled the band to embark on an extensive world tour and perform at famous festivals such as Monsters of Rock. Helloween went on to release Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II in 1988, which went gold in Germany and brought even more success than its predecessor. The Keeper of the Seven Keys albums proved to be highly influential and aided in the formation of a new wave of European power metal bands, such as Blind Guardian, Stratovarius, HammerFall and Edguy. After the completion of the band's 1988 headlining tour, the album Live in the UK was released, while Kai Hansen left the band and was replaced by guitarist Roland Grapow. Legal disputes with their record company, prevented Helloween from releasing new material until 1991's Pink Bubbles Go Ape, which was followed by 1993's Chameleon. These two albums saw the band moving away from their power metal roots and experimenting with different sounds. Both Pink Bubbles Go Ape and Chameleon were commercial failures and resulted in Kiske leaving Helloween. Kiske was fired from the band in 1993, reportedly for personal reasons. He was replaced by Pink Cream 69's Andi Deris, who has remained with Helloween ever since. Kiske was rumored to be Bruce Dickinson's replacement, after he departed from Iron Maiden in 1993, but the position was filled by Blaze Bayley. In 2016, it was announced that Michael Kiske would join Helloween, together with Kai Hansen, for a reunion tour that would take place during 2017 and 2018. The Pumpkins United World Tour started in October 2017 in South America and continued in Europe with concerts lasting close to three hours. On December 8, 2017 the single Pumpkins United, featuring the reunited line-up, was released. The reunion tour continued throughout 2018 in Japan, Russia, Ukraine, Europe, North America, Canada and Latin America. The Pumpkins United World Tour was the biggest one in the band's history as it comprised 69 shows and lasted for 14 months. A live DVD/Blu-ray entitled United Alive and the live album United Alive in Madrid were released on October 4, 2019. The band embarked on a Brazilian tour in September 2019, which started at Rockfest (Sao Paulo) and ended with their performance at the Rock In Rio Festival. A new studio album with Kiske and Hansen is due to be released in 2020. =Solo work (1996‚Äì2008)= On August 16, 1996, three years after leaving Helloween, Kiske released his first solo album, Instant Clarity. The album featured guest appearances by Adrian Smith of Iron Maiden, Kai Hansen and Ciriaco Taraxes and contained songs in a wide variety of styles. A music video for the ballad \\"Always\\", dedicated to deceased Helloween drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg, was filmed and produced in New York City. During the same year he also wrote a book, 'Kunst Und Materialismus', which is only available in German. Instant Clarity was reissued in 2006 with the addition of 4 bonus tracks. His second solo album, Readiness to Sacrifice, which included some songs by Ciriaco Taraxes, was released in Korea and Japan in 1999 and in Europe in 2001. The music on the album featured Michael moving completely away from his heavy metal roots and even contained two symphonic songs. In 2003, out of desire to make rock music again, Kiske formed a project, named SupaRed. They released a self-titled album in January 2003. This album had a modern rock sound and a song structure, distinct from both his solo albums and the heavy metal sound of Helloween. The project was under promoted and unsuccessful and he dissolved the band. In 2006, Michael Kiske released his third full-length solo album under the name of Kiske. The album contained songs in a mellow, acoustic singer-songwriter style and was a step away from the sound of his previous solo albums. According to Michael \\"It's a healthy-careless and musically free album. I am very proud of this record because it is a true statement from myself\\". In 2008, Kiske released his fourth solo work, entitled Past in Different Ways. The album contained acoustic re-arrangements of his old Helloween material and one new song. According to Kiske the album \\"on one hand shows that I don't reject my past just because I'm a different person today, and on the other hand it can maybe give people who were part of that past a different view at those songs\\". =Avantasia (since 2000)= Michael Kiske live with Avantasia in 2013 In 2000, Tobias Sammet (vocalist of the band Edguy) asked Kiske to participate in the rock opera project Avantasia. Michael agreed to sing on the project, in the role of Lugaid Vandroiy, but only under the nickname of Ernie. The nickname was printed on the back of the first Avantasia release, The Metal Opera, but not on the sequel, The Metal Opera Part II, where he was featured under his real name. Michael said in interviews that, at that time, he did not want people to link him to heavy metal anymore. He had a main role in the concept of the Metal Opera albums and performed on the songs \\"Reach Out for the Light\\", \\"Breaking Away\\", \\"Farewell\\", \\"Avantasia\\", \\"The Tower\\", \\"The Seven Angels\\" and \\"No Return\\". During 2007, he recorded guest vocals for two Avantasia tracks; \\"Promised Land\\" and \\"Lost in Space [Extended Version]\\", both of which appeared on the Lost in Space Part I & II compilation album (\\"Promised Land\\" was also featured on the EP Lost in Space Part II). In 2008, Michael took part in the Avantasia album The Scarecrow, singing lead on the track \\"Shelter From The Rain\\" and backing on the title track and on \\"What Kind of Love\\". During 2010, Kiske performed on the Avantasia albums The Wicked Symphony and Angel of Babylon, singing on the tracks \\"Wastelands\\", \\"Runaway Train\\" and \\"Stargazers\\". Between November and December, he also took part in \\"The Metal Opera Comes to Town Tour\\", sharing the stage with Tobias Sammet, Kai Hansen, J√∏rn Lande, Bob Catley, Amanda Somerville, Sascha Paeth, and Oliver Hartmann among others. On August 6, 2011, Michael performed with Avantasia at the Wacken Open Air Festival. During 2013, Kiske took part in the Avantasia album The Mystery of Time, singing on the songs \\"Where Clock Hands Freeze\\", \\"Savior in the Clockwork\\" and \\"Dweller in a Dream\\". Between April and August, he also participated on \\"The Mystery World Tour\\", which included 10 European festival appearances and 3-hour long shows in South America, Japan, Russia and Europe. On August 2, 2014, Michael performed with Avantasia at the Wacken Open Air festival once again. In 2016, Kiske participated in the Avantasia album Ghostlights, singing on the songs \\"Ghostlights\\", \\"Unchain The Light\\" and on the bonus track \\"Wake Up To The Moon\\". Between March and August of the same year, he was part of the biggest Avantasia tour, entitled \\"Ghostlights World Tour\\", which consisted of more than 40 concerts in Europe, North America, South America, Canada, Japan, Russia and Scandinavia. During 2019, Michael participated in the Avantasia album Moonglow, singing on the song \\"Requiem For A Dream\\". =Place Vendome (2005‚Äì2017)= In 2005, Kiske took part in the Place Vendome project, on Frontiers Records. Place Vendome consisted of Dennis Ward (bass and production), Kosta Zafiriou (drums) and Uwe Reitenauer (guitars) from the German band Pink Cream 69, Gunther Werno (keyboards) from the band Vanden Plas and Kiske on vocals. The project's debut album, Place Vendome, was a blend of melodic hard rock and AOR (comparable to the sound of bands such as Foreigner or Journey) and the majority of the songwriting was provided by Dennis Ward. In 2009, the Place Vendome project released its second album entitled Streets of Fire. A video was filmed for the song \\"My Guardian Angel\\", marking Michael's visual return since 1996. The songwriting for the second album was provided by musicians Magnus Karlsson (Primal Fear), Torsti Spoof (Leverage), Ronny Milianowicz (Saint Deamon) and Robert Sall (Work of Art). In 2013, Frontiers Records released Place Vendome's third album entitled Thunder in the Distance. The songwriters for this release were Alessandro Del Vecchio (Hardline), Timo Tolkki (ex-Stratovarius), Brett Jones, Tommy Denander (Radioactive), Magnus Karlsson (Primal Fear), S√∂ren Kronqvist (Sunstorm), Roberto Tiranti and Andrea Cantarelli (Labyrinth).

The project was named Kiske/Somerville and it marked the contribution of musicians Mat Sinner, Magnus Karlsson, Sander Gommans, Martin Schmidt and Jimmy Kresic. The self-titled debut album was released on September 24, 2010. Two videos were filmed for the songs \\"Silence\\" and \\"If I Had A Wish\\", enabling most of the participants to actually meet in person. The second Kiske/Somerville album entitled City of Heroes was released on April 17, 2015. Mat Sinner, Magnus Karlsson and Veronika Lukesova handled the instrumentation, while Jacob Hansen and Sinner were in charge of the production.

Singing style In comparison to Kai Hansen, Kiske had a more vibrant and clean voice. Some fans and critics have likened his singing style and range to that of Geoff Tate or a young Samson-era Bruce Dickinson, with shades of Rob Halford. He has a tenor type voice and possesses an almost 4 octave vocal range, as he is capable of reaching extremely high notes (A5) and low baritone notes (E2) as well. Kiske's time in Helloween has proven to be highly influential and many singers cite him as a major influence. Recognition and honors Named favorite vocalist Rank:5.

Kampl has been mayor of the town of Gurk since 1991, and was a member of the Federal Council of Austria (the Bundesrat) from 2004 to 2009. Biography and political career Kampl was born in Steuerberg, in the Austrian state of Carinthia. He completed the agricultural vocational school and an agricultural technical school. He married Elizabeth Bucher in 1960. In 1974 he was selected to be the local party chairman of the Austrian Freedom Party (FP√ñ) in Gurk; two years later he became its district party chairman. In 1979 he was elected to the Gurk local council, and was selected immediately to be vice mayor, a position he retained for twelve years. During this time period, he was also elected to the state parliament (Landtag) of Carinthia, in which he served for the FP√ñ from 1982 through 1994. In 1991, he was elected mayor of Gurk with 53.4% of the vote, and also remained a member of the Landtag. In 2004, he was sent as a representative of Carinthia to the Federal Council of Austria (the Bundesrat), where he again sat with the FP√ñ. In the Federal Council, Kampl was closely allied with controversial FP√ñ leader J√∂rg Haider, who he had helped propel to the party leadership in 1986. Kampl calls himself \\"very homeland- connected\\" and nationalist. When the FP√ñ split in April 2005, Kampl followed Haider to his new party, the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ√ñ). He resigned from the party on 7 June 2005 as the result of a controversy (see below), and left its parliamentary fraction on 1 November 2005, sitting the rest of his term as an independent. =2005 controversy= On 19 April 2005 Kampl made a speech against the rehabilitation of Austrian armed-forced members who had deserted during World War II. He argued that the deserters were \\"assassins of battle comrades\\", and criticized what he called the \\"brutal persecution\\" of Austrian Nazis after 1945, saying that \\"more than 99% of Austrians\\" had been members of the Nazi party. He was heavily pressured to resign, and agreed to do so on 28 April. However, about a month later (on 29 May), he said he stood by his views (although he said he may have phrased them differently in retrospect), and would not in fact be resigning. He attributed his decision not to resign partly to what he called the \\"provocative\\" manner in which Federal Council President Georg Pehm (a Social Democrat) had demanded he do so. He did, however, resign his membership in the BZ√ñ, saying he did not want to burden the party with the controversy. Kampl's backtracking on resignation caused an even bigger controversy because, coincidentally, he was scheduled to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the Federal Council on 1 July. Left-leaning lawmakers demanded that Chancellor Wolfgang Sch√ºssel intervene to prevent Kampl from assuming the presidency of the upper house, and threatened a walkout if he was allowed to do so. In the end, the Federal Council resolved matters itself by passing a constitutional amendment, informally labelled Lex Kampl (Latin for \\"Kampl's law\\"), allowing the Council to, by a two-thirds vote, replace anyone scheduled to take over the rotating presidency with a different member of the same party. The amendment was agreed upon by all four main parties (including the FP√ñ and BZ√ñ) and passed unanimously, although BZ√ñ member Roland Zellot left the chamber before the vote. The amendment entered into force on 25 June, just in time to prevent Kampl from becoming president of the Council.

It is one of the world's largest companies in the rail vehicle and equipment manufacturing and servicing industry. Headquartered in Berlin, Germany, Bombardier Transportation has many regional offices, production and development facilities worldwide. Bombardier Transportation produces a wide range of products including passenger rail vehicles, locomotives, bogies, propulsion and controls. In February 2020, Alstom agreed terms to buy the Bombardier Transportation division and signed a Memorandum of understanding to do so for between ‚Ç¨5.8 billion and ‚Ç¨6.2 billion. In February 2020, the company had 36,000 employees, and 63 manufacturing and engineering locations around the world. History =20th century= 1970s: Formation and first orders Bombardier Transportation's first order for mass transit rolling stock was in 1974 for the Soci√©t√© de transport de Montr√©al (STM) (Montreal transport authority) to build metro trains for the Montreal Metro.JRTR No.42 (December 2005) The core of the Transportation group was formed with the purchase of Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) in 1975.Bombardier takes over MLW Railway Gazette International February 1975 page 45  1980s: Expansion to the US, France and Belgium  With the 1975 purchase, Bombardier acquired MLW's LRC (Light, Rapid, Comfortable) tilting train design which it produced in the 1980s. In 1987, Bombardier bought the assets of US railcar manufacturers Budd and Pullman-Standard.Bombardier buys Budd passenger car designs Railway Age October 1987 page 37 In the late 1980s Bombardier Transportation gained a manufacturing presence in Europe with the acquisition of a 45% share in BN Constructions Ferroviaires et M√©talliques (whose principal site was in Bruges, Belgium) in 1986, and the acquisition of ANF-Industries (whose principal site was in Crespin, France, near the Belgian border) in 1989. 1990s: Expansion to Mexico, Germany and the UK In 1990, Procor Engineering of Horbury near Wakefield, England; a manufacturer of bodyshells, was acquired, and renamed Bombardier Prorail. In 1991 the group purchased Urban Transportation Development Corporation (UTDC) from the Government of Ontario, which had previously acquired Hawker Siddeley Canada. MLW was sold to General Electric in 1988. GE ended railcar operations in Canada in 1993. Bombardier Transportation continues to operate the railcar operations in Thunder Bay. In 1991 the grouping Bombardier Eurorail was formed consisting of the company's European subsidiaries; BN, ANF-Industrie, Prorail, and BWS. In 1992, the company acquired Mexico's largest railway rolling-stock manufacturer, Concarril, from the Mexican government. In 1995 Waggonfabrik Talbot in Aachen, Germany, and in 1998, Deutsche Waggonbau (DW), and Ateliers de Constructions M√©caniques de Vevey in Vevey, Switzerland, were acquired. DW encompassed the major portion of the railway equipment industry of the former East Germany (\\"Kombinat Schienenfahrzeugbau\\"), and had its principal sites in Bautzen and G√∂rlitz. =21st century= 2000s: Western world's largest rail-equipment manufacturer In May 2001, Bombardier Transportation acquired Adtranz from DaimlerChrysler, and became by many measurements the Western world's largest rail-equipment manufacturer. The takeover was approved by the EU Competition Commission subject to a number of minor clauses including the divestment of Bombardier's stake in Adtranz/Stadler joint venture Stadler Pankow (sold to Stadler Rail), and an agreement to retain Kiepe Electric as a supplier, and ELIN as a partner for a number of years after the acquisition.For Adtranz read Bombardier The Railway Magazine issue 1203 July 2001 page 10 The addition of Adtranz made Bombardier a manufacturer of locomotives along with its existing product lines of passenger carriages, multiple-unit trains, and trams. With the acquisition of Adtranz, Bombardier also gained competence in the electrical propulsion components business. After the Adtranz acquisition in 2001, Bombardier Transportation moved its core manufacturing strategy for Europe with a few legacy plants in North America for the smaller North American market: * three sites for bogie manufacture were to be at Siegen in Germany, Derby, England and at the former ANF plant in Crespin (France). * Vehicle body manufacturing was to be done at Bautzen and G√∂rlitz (Germany), at the former Kalmar Verkstad plant (Sweden), at the Derby Litchurch Lane Works, and the former BN Constructions Ferroviaries et M√©talliques in Brugge. * For final assembly, the company chose the former Waggonfabrik Talbot plant in Aachen and the former LEW Hennigsdorf (nr. Berlin) in Germany, the former Sorefame plant in Amadora, Portugal, and its plants in Derby, Crespin, Brugge, Kalmar and Pratteln, Switzerland. Additionally a number of plants would have specialised manufacturing roles, including ƒåesk√° L√≠pa (Czech Republic) and the Pafawag facility in Poland which would supply parts and welded structures, and sites in Vienna (Austria) and Bautzen (Germany) which would specialise in light rail vehicle (LRV) manufacture whilst double deck trains for the German market would be manufactured in G√∂rlitz. Other sites had their work mandate reduced in scope, or were closed. In 2004 due to overcapacity in the European passenger train industry, Bombardier announced a restructuring program resulting in the closure of several plants; in the UK, the bogie production site at Pride Park, Derby, Bombardier Prorail (Wakefield), and a maintenance facility in Doncaster were closed; in mainland Europe, the plants at Pratteln, Kalmar and Amadora were to be closed, as well as plants in Ammendorf and Vetschau in eastern Germany which had been slated for closure in 2001. 2010s: Global operations and consolidations In late 2012 Bombardier announced the closure of the Bombardier Talbot plant in Aachen, and a reduction in workforce in the transportation division of 1,200 people. The company obtained two major orders in 2014: San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) ordered an additional 365 rail cars from Bombardier in early 2014, to be assembled at Bombardier's plant in Plattsburgh, New York; Transport for London (United Kingdom) awarded a ¬£1.3 billion contract to provide 70 Aventra trains for Crossrail, and included the building of a maintenance depot at Old Oak Common. In May 2014 Bombardier extended its presence in Australia by purchasing a 100% stake in Rail Signalling Service (RSS), an Australian company focused on designing and constructing rail signalling solutions. In Sep 2014 the downsizing and eventual closure of the Maryborough factory was announced, the factory closed in Dec 2015. In January 2015 the government of Hungary nationalised the loss-making and under-utilised Bombardier carriage works at Dunakeszi (Bombardier M√ÅV Kft., Hungarian), acquiring a 64.9% stake for $7.8 million. Former headquarters in 2016 In May 2015 the parent company Bombardier Inc. announced that it intended to split or spin-off Bombardier Transportation as a separate publicly traded company, while retaining control as the majority owner. Lutz Bertling, president and CEO of Bombardier Transportation stated that a primary motivation for the sell off was to increase the company's financial flexibility, for potential acquisitions or consolidations, allowing the company to better compete with an anticipated Chinese presence in the European market. An IPO was planned for late 2015. In late 2015 the public investor Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec (CDPQ) acquired a US$1.5 billion stake in Bombardier Transportation in the form of a bond/equity hybrid, with the shares returned to CDPQ dependent on the financial performance of the company. The investment initially representing a 30% stake - a valuation of $5 billion. The sale was required in part to continue the financing of the parent company's CSeries jet, a major cause of a $4.6billion loss for the parent company in 2015. In late 2015 the National Railway Company of Belgium awarded a Bombardier/Alstom consortium a large ‚Ç¨3.3 billion contract for 1,362 M7 doubledecker passenger rail vehicles, with a value to Bombardier of around ‚Ç¨2.1 billion. In August 2016 Bombardier opened a production facility in Isando, Johannesburg, South Africa. The site was specialised for the production of electric traction equipment (Mitrac). In December 2016 citing a 'challenging market environment', Bombardier said that a 'strategic realignment' would put 'a strong focus on product standardisation and site specialisation in order to become more efficient and effective'. Up to 2,200 jobs are expected to go, with the German plants in Hennigsdorf, G√∂rlitz and Bautzen reportedly most affected. By 2018, Bombardier was the 3rd largest rail-equipment manufacturer in the Western World and fourth globally, eclipsed by CRRC, Siemens and Alstom. Sale to Alstom In February 2020, Alstom agreed terms to buy the Bombardier Transportation division and signed a Memorandum of understanding to do so for between ‚Ç¨5.8 billion and ‚Ç¨6.2 billion. The deal requires approval by Alstom shareholders at a meeting to be held in October 2020 and approval by European regulators. Bombardier's major shareholder, Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec, had already agreed to the sale. In July 2020, the European Commission approved the sale and it is expected to close in the first half of 2021.Alstom's acquisition of Bombardier Transportation cleared by European Commission Railway Gazette International 1 August 2020 Products and services =Metro rolling stock= MBTA Red Line train (Boston Subway) CTA 5000 in Chicago New York City Subway R142 car London Underground 2009 Stock Delhi Metro broad gauge train, manufactured by Bombardier Toronto Rocket subway car Bombardier Innovia Metro 300 car at Vancouver Skytrain Bombardier's standard metro vehicles are the mid-sized fully automated and driverless Bombardier Innovia Metro with the option for linear induction motor propulsion or a conventional rotary motor, and the high-capacity customizable Bombardier Movia Metro, which is powered by conventional motors and can also be fully automated.

Legal issues =Deutsche Bahn= In early 2013, Deutsche Bahn announced that it was suing Bombardier for ‚Ç¨350 million because of some serious defects in trains used on the suburban S-Bahn rail network in Berlin. This was in addition to the ‚Ç¨160 million it was asking for from Bombardier because of problems with more than 200 regional trains operating in southern Germany and problems with the brakes in regional and local trains in Munich. The matter was settled out of court in March 2015. Lutz Bertling, head of Bombardier's transportation division at the time, confirmed the two firms had come to an agreement, saying: \\"The settlement is a positive signal for our future cooperation.\\" =Everline= In January 2015, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that South Korea's Special Investigation Unit for anti-corruption produced a report accusing Bombardier Transportation of corruption in the pursuit of the 2004 contract to build an 18 km elevated Light Rapid Transit (LRT) rail system called the Everline connecting the Giheung Station on the Bundang (Yellow Line) of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system to a large amusement park named Everland, via Yongin, the 12th largest city in South Korea, about 30 km from central Seoul. The investigation report alleges that Bombardier provided gifts and trips to Canada for civil servants and politicians involved in the contract decision, which was based on revenue expected from an inflated estimate of 180,000 passengers per day using the service. It also alleges that Bombardier created a $2-million slush fund for the Canadian citizen Kim Hak-Pil, a high-ranking Bombardier executive in South Korea. Bombardier has consistently denied the corruption allegations, stating that \\"They were not pleasure trips. There is a need to convince the people that our technology works well.... If it had been corruption, they would have charged us.\\" The statute of limitations has now expired, due to lack of evidence according to Bombardier. Everline operation has been financially troubled since construction was completed in 2010. The system remained dormant until service began in 2013 while the line owner successfully negotiated with the city of Yongin a minimum revenue guarantee of 29.5 billion KRW per year regardless of passenger load. This is said to be a serious burden for the city because ridership is reported to have risen to only about 20,000 passengers per day on the 30 carriages, or about a quarter of the maximum possible capacity of the fleet in a 12-hour day. A reason suggested for this is the fare of 1100 KRW (about US$1 in 2015); it is impossible to pay for Everline trips via a transfer surcharge on a connecting subway ticket. A 2014 web page of a Seoul tour service retailer makes no mention of the Everline among the suggested modes of bus transport between Seoul and Everland. A lawyer who filed legal action on behalf of the citizens of Yongin is reported to have provided details about Bombardier's pursuit of the contract. He said that \\"between 2003 and 2005, Bombardier funded three luxurious trips to Canada to each of 37 people\\" including 18 Yongin city councillors on so-called \\"LRT field trips\\". Toronto Flexity streetcars in December 2018 =Toronto Transit Commission= On 16 October 2015, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) announced that it has asked its board to consider legal action against Bombardier. TTC staff is recommending that the TTC board \\"commence legal action, or make a claim allowed for already in the contract, of $50 million for late delivery\\" against Bombardier. Bombardier had committed to delivering 67 custom-built Flexity Outlook streetcars to the TTC by October 2015 for its streetcar system, but only 10 were in service at the time. On 28 October 2015, the TTC board voted in favour of a lawsuit against Bombardier \\"for at least $50 million to recoup lost costs\\", according to Chair Josh Colle, because of the company's failure to deliver the additional new streetcars.

He was an early member in the SS, and served with the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler and at the Dachau concentration camp in 1930s. During World War II, Deisenhofer served with several combat divisions on both the Eastern and Western fronts, earning the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. He held a PhD in political economy. Early SS career Deisenhofer received his PhD as a political economist. During his time at university, he had come into contact with the Nazi Party, and soon applied to join the SA. A few months with the SA, Deisenhofer transferred to the SS, beginning his service on 1 October 1930. Deisenhofer held various low level command positions, including service with the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler in 1934 and at the Dachau concentration camp in 1935. Over the next two years he served in both the Totenkopfverb√§nde units SS Totenkopf Verbande Sachsen and SS Totenkopf Standarte Thuringen. World War II At the outbreak of war Deisenhofer served in the SS Totenkopf Standarte, which was responsible for the police and security measures during the Invasion of Poland. After the Polish campaign, his unit was absorbed into the newly formed SS Division Totenkopf, where he served as a battalion commander during the Campaign in the West, receiving the Iron Cross First Class for his bravery in combat. In May Deisenhofer was appointed commander of a battalion of the newly formed Dutch and Belgian volunteer formation SS Volunteer Standarte Nordwest. In August 1941, Deisenhofer was transferred to the command of the Regiment Germania, one of the Infantry regiments of the SS Division Wiking, currently serving on the Eastern Front. Deisenhofer was sent back to the Totenkopf division in February 1942 as a regimental commander. The division was encircled in the Demyansk Pocket, where he commanded a battle group during the breakout, receiving a Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his actions. Deisenhofer then served as an SS training officer. In March 1944, Deisenhofer was sent back to a combat formation, this time to command a regiment of the 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg, which took part in the operation to relieve the encircled 1st Panzer Army of Generaloberst Hans-Valentin Hube in what was known as the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket. The Frundsberg was sent to the Normandy to attempt to halt the advance of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group, currently advancing on Caen. Deisenhofer's unit saw action during Operation Epsom, which resulted in German defeat. In mid July, Deisenhofer was ordered back east to take command of the SS Division Wiking, currently engaged in heavy fighting in the area near Modlin. At the end of August, he took over command of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G√∂tz von Berlichingen. Near the end of January, Deisenhofer disappeared when traveling to a new command post. He was classified as missing in action.

A classic and well-known use of eucatastrophe. Illustration by Gustave Dor√© A eucatastrophe is a sudden turn of events at the end of a story which ensures that the protagonist does not meet some terrible, impending, and very plausible and probable doom. The writer J. R. R. Tolkien coined the word by affixing the Greek prefix eu, meaning good, to catastrophe, the word traditionally used in classically inspired literary criticism to refer to the \\"unraveling\\" or conclusion of a drama's plot. For Tolkien, the term appears to have had a thematic meaning that went beyond its literal etymological meaning in terms of form.Greek eu = \\"good\\", kata = \\"down\\", strephein = \\"to turn or rotate\\" In his definition as outlined in his 1947 essay \\"On Fairy-Stories\\", eucatastrophe is a fundamental part of his conception of mythopoeia. Though Tolkien's interest is in myth, it is also connected to the gospel; Tolkien calls the Incarnation of Christ the eucatastrophe of \\"human history\\" and the Resurrection the eucatastrophe of the Incarnation. Eucatastrophe has been labelled by some as a form of deus ex machina, due to both sharing an impossible problem being suddenly resolved. However, differences between the two have also been noted, such as its inherent connection to an optimistic view on the unfolding of events in the narrative of the world. In Tolkien's view, eucatastrophe can also occur without the use of a deus ex machina. Examples in Tolkien's work The climax of The Lord of The Rings, as portrayed by Ted Nasmith The best-known and most fully realized eucatastrophe in Tolkien's work occurs in the climax of The Lord of the Rings. Though victory seems assured for Sauron, the One Ring is permanently destroyed as a result of Gollum's waylaying of Frodo at Mount Doom. Frodo essentially fails his impossible quest at its very end, claiming the Ring for himself ‚Äì however, at this moment, Gollum suddenly appears, steals the ring, and in his ecstatic gloating falls into the fire. If not for Frodo's previous mercy in sparing Gollum's life (a great risk due to Gollum's obvious treachery, met with bitter protest by Sam), and if not for the Ring‚Äôs own corruptive influence on Gollum, Sauron would surely have reclaimed it. Thus, Evil is inadvertently and unforeseeably defeated through a small act of kindness and through its own corruptive machinations. Another example of eucatastrophe is the recurring role of the eagles as unexpected rescuers throughout Tolkien's writing. Tolkien described Bilbo's \\"'eucatastrophic emotion\\" at the eagles' appearance in The Hobbit as one of the key moments of the book.

Before the extension opens, Sydney Trains will no longer serve stations between this station and Sydenham to the east, so that the nine intermediate stations can be converted for driverless Metro operation. Sydney Trains will continue to run services between Bankstown station and the Main Southern railway line to the west. As part of the project, Bankstown station will be upgraded to have an additional at-grade station entrance at the eastern end of the existing platforms, which will align with The Appian Way and Restwell Street. The new entrance will also provide access to Sydney Metro platforms, which will be built east of the new entrance over the road connection between North and South Terraces. The existing station entrance will be retained and the existing platforms is proposed to be retained and extended westwards. Platforms & services Traditionally, services operated in a loop from the city via Sydenham to Bankstown, then on to Lidcombe, returning to the city via Strathfield and the Main Suburban line and vice versa.

It was founded in 1953, and was named for the Laboratory's second director (1945-1970), Norris E. Bradbury. Among the museum's early exhibits, artifacts and documents from World War II Manhattan Project were displayed upon declassification. Other exhibits include full-size models of the Little Boy and Fat Man atomic bombs. Admission is free. Early years In 1953, Robert Krohn, who was in charge of early nuclear tests at what was then called Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, decided the Laboratory needed a museum to house historical weapons-research artifacts. Krohn convinced Norris Bradbury (Laboratory director, 1945-1970) a museum could preserve the Laboratory's history and provide a place for official visitors to learn about the Laboratory's weapon programs. An old ice house on the bank of Ashley Pond across from Fuller Lodge became the first Laboratory museum. Already fitted with a vault door, the ice house satisfied security standards for housing the classified exhibits Krohn wanted to preserve. The ice house Museum opened to official visitors in 1954. In 1963, Robert Porton, director of community relations at the Laboratory, expressed an interest in adding unclassified exhibits to the Museum. Bradbury approved the transfer of unclassified exhibits to an area open to the public, and soon World War II-era documents and photographs, tracing the development of the town and the Laboratory, were displayed with scientific memorabilia and working models of unclassified research projects. In its first year, 14,000 visitors from 50 states and 40 countries visited the Museum. In 1965, the Museum was moved to larger quarters. The range and number of exhibits grew rapidly and included many hands-on models contributed by scientific groups and divisions within the Laboratory. Named after Norris E. Bradbury In 1970, the museum was renamed the Norris E. Bradbury Science Museum, honoring the laboratory's second director. Eventually, the museum's official name was shortened to the Bradbury Science Museum. Major renovations to the Museum took place in 1981. Informal, donated exhibits gave way to professionally designed exhibits in a formal museum atmosphere. Videotapes, videodisks, and interactive computer programs were introduced. New artifacts included a Mark 12A warhead, models of Vela and Navistar verification and communication satellites, and an air-launched cruise missile. Moved to downtown Los Alamos By 1987, annual attendance had reached 80,000, and parking space for visitors was disappearing. Laboratory officials began exploring options for relocating the Museum site. In April 1993, the Museum moved into its new and present location in the heart of downtown Los Alamos. The building was designed by William Agnew and Associates and is leased by the Laboratory from a private owner. Today Model of the Fat Man atomic bomb. One of the thousands of leaflets dropped on Hiroshima warning the Japanese of further atomic attacks unless the government surrendered. Approximately 40 interactive exhibits trace the history of the World War II Manhattan Project, highlight the Laboratory's current and historic research projects related to defense and technology, and focus on Laboratory research related to national security, nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship, and other fields. Recent additions to the museum's collections are exhibits about the history of supercomputers, the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, Los Alamos' contributions to the Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity rover), nanotechnology, algae biofuels, and high explosives.

In 1840, Maconochie became the Governor of Norfolk Island, a prison island where convicts were treated with severe brutality and were seen as lost causes. Upon reaching the island, Maconochie immediately instituted policies that restored dignity to prisoners, achieving remarkable success in prisoner rehabilitation. These policies were well in advance of their time and Maconochie was politically undermined. His ideas would be largely ignored and forgotten, only to be readopted as the basis of modern penal systems over a century later in the mid- to late 20th century. Early life, naval career and geographer Maconochie was born in Edinburgh on 11 February 1787. At the age of 9, his father died and he was raised by Allan Maconochie, later Lord Meadowbank. He joined the Royal Navy in 1803 and as a midshipman saw active service in the Napoleonic Wars, rising to the rank of Lieutenant,. In 1811 he was serving on the Brig HMS Grasshopper, which shipwrecked Christmas Eve off the coast of the Dutch Coast. He, together with all those on board, were taken as a prisoner of war and extradited to the French. The forced march in the winter-bitter-cold of Holland to Verdun and more than two years of miserable imprisonment gave him an experience that he used later in his penal reform. He was released upon Napoleon's abdication in 1814. He returned to active service in the British-American War where he commanded HMS Calliope. In 1815, he was promoted to the rank of Commander. In the peace following the final defeat of Napoleon, Maconochie spent 13 years in Edinburgh studying geography and geopolitics. At this time he wrote extensively on steam navigation and the colonisation of the Pacific. He married in 1822. In 1828 he moved to London, England where he was a founder and first secretary of the Royal Geographical Society in 1830. In 1833 he became the first professor of Geography at the University College London, and was a knight of the Royal Guelphic Order.  Penal reformer  In 1836 he sailed to the convict settlement at Hobart in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) as private secretary to the Lieutenant-Governor Sir John Franklin. Here he wrote a report strongly critical of the state of prison discipline. The convict system, being fixated on punishment alone, released back into society crushed, resentful and bitter expirees, in whom the spark of enterprise and hope was dead. Maconochie's report ‚Äúcan be said to mark the peak and incipient decline of transportation to Australia‚Äù when it was given to Lord Russell, the Home Secretary and ardent critic of transportation, claims Robert Hughes. Although this report was used by the Molesworth Committee on transportation in 1837-38, the criticism of this work forced Franklin to dismiss him. According to his biographer John Barry, Maconochie ‚Äúwas a deeply religious man, of generous and compassionate temperament, and convinced of the dignity of man.‚Äù His two basic principles of penology were that: * as cruelty debases both the victim and society, punishment should not be vindictive but should aim at the reform of the convict to observe social constraints, and * a convict's imprisonment should consist of task, not time sentences, with release depending on the performance of a measurable amount of labour. Following the Molesworth committee's report, transportation to New South Wales was abolished in 1840, although it continued to other colonies. Disturbed at reports of conditions on Norfolk Island, Lord Normanby, Secretary of State for the Colonies, suggested that a new system should be used, and the superintendence given to an officer deeply concerned with the moral welfare of the convicts. Maconochie was recommended to put this new system in place. In March 1840 he took up duties as commandant of the penal settlement at Norfolk Island and applied his penal principles. Convicts were awarded 'marks' to encourage effort and thrift. Sentences were served in stages, each increasing in responsibility. Cruel punishments and degrading conditions were reduced, and convicts' sense of dignity was respected. Perhaps the fact that he has experienced the life of a prisoner himself, played a part in his approach to his task. He was the only commandant with such an experience. These views contrasted greatly with the cruel conditions that had existed on Norfolk Island prior to Maconochie's arrival. He was not permitted to apply his principles to the 1,200 hardened twice-sentenced convicts, but only to the 600 newcomers sent directly from the United Kingdom and who were separated from the 'Old Hands'. His 'mark' system was not permitted to reduce a convict's sentence, and it was difficult to find other incentives. His reforms were resisted by military guards, supervisors and constables (many of whom were ex- convicts) at his command. In particular, his deputy held views opposite to his own. In an exclusively male environment, he found he was unable to reduce the 'unnatural offence' of sodomy which was prevalent and which he continued to punish by flogging. Criticism of his methods in Sydney and England led Governor Sir George Gipps to visit the island in 1843. He was favourably impressed with the condition of the convicts and the effectiveness of the 'marks' system, and reported that Maconochie's System of Moral Reform could work if carried through to its conclusion. However the order had already been given in the United Kingdom for Maconochie to be replaced. Under the commandants who followed him, Norfolk Island reverted to being an object of terror under brutal masters. Almost 1,400 convicts had been discharged during Maconochie's term, and he always claimed that a high percentage did not offend again. He is known as the \\"Father of Parole\\". Later life Maconochie returned to the UK in 1844 and two years later published a book outlining his system. This had an immense influence on the development of penology. In 1849 he was appointed governor of the new prison at Birmingham, but was dismissed and criticised for his actions, in spite of being praised for his humanity and benevolence. He died on 25 October 1860 at Morden in Surrey, still campaigning for penal reform in spite of ill-health. He was buried at St Lawrence Church, London Road, Morden, Surrey. His grave can still be seen in the Churchyard. Legacy John Barry states that ‚ÄúMaconochie was a pioneer in penal reform, and suffered the fate of men in advance of their times. His concepts and many of his practical measures are now the basis of Western penal systems.‚Äù The Alexander Maconochie Centre, a prison in Canberra, is named in his honour. Sir Walter Frederick Crofton (1815‚Äì1897) introduced a variant of the ‚Äòprogressive stages‚Äô system of penal discipline into the Irish convict prisons.

The title is used mainly in the Anglican Communion, the Roman Catholic Church, and many Lutheran denominations. A dean's assistant is called a subdean. History Latin decanus in the Roman military was the head of a group of ten soldiers within a centuria, and by the 5th century CE, it was the head of a group of ten monks. It came to refer to various civil functionaries in the later Roman Empire.Oxford English Dictionary s.v. Based on the monastic use, it came to mean the head of a chapter of canons of a collegiate church or cathedral church. Based on that use, deans in universities now fill various administrative positions. Latin decanus should not be confused with Greek di√°konos (Œ¥ŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøœÇ),' from which the word deacon derives, which describes a supportive role.  Officials  In the Roman Catholic Church, the Dean of the College of Cardinals and the Cardinal Vice-Dean are the president and vice- president of the college. Both are elected. Except for presiding and delegating administrative tasks, they have no authority over the cardinals, acting as primus inter pares (first among equals). In the universities that grew out of the cathedral and monastery schools, a university dean came to be an official with various administrative duties. Anglican Communion =Cathedrals= In the Church of England and elsewhere in the Anglican Communion, the dean is the chief resident cleric of a cathedral or other collegiate church and the head of the chapter of canons. If the cathedral or collegiate church has its own parish, the dean is usually also rector of the parish. However, in the Church of Ireland the roles are often separated, and most cathedrals in the Church of England do not have associated parishes. In the Church in Wales, however, most cathedrals are parish churches, and their deans are now also vicars of their parishes. In some parts of the Communion (particularly in the Scottish Episcopal Church and, formerly in some cathedrals in England), the senior resident cleric in a cathedral is a provost. Each diocese of the Scottish Episcopal Church has a dean of the diocese: this is a cleric who, rather than heading the cathedral staff, assists the bishop in the administration of the diocese. In this way, a Scottish Episcopal dean is similar to an archdeacon in the other member churches of the Communion (a post that does not exist in the Scottish church). In the Anglican Church of Canada, the roles of senior cleric of the cathedral are combined in one person who is referred to as \\"Rector of Cathedral and Dean of Diocese\\". Thus, Peter Elliott is Rector of Christ Church Cathedral and Dean of New Westminster. The style The Very Reverend distinguishes a cleric as a dean (or a cathedral provost). For example, the Very Reverend June Osborne was Dean of Salisbury Cathedral. The legal act by which a cathedral dean in the Church of England takes up his or her role is the institution, which is invariably followed in the same service by the installation (into his/her stall in the cathedral church); an \\"institution and installation\\" are very often referred to simply as an installation. In consideration of the high status of a Dean, the Very Reverend title is normally a permanent title preferment. Some important deans include the deans of St Paul's, Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. Westminster Abbey is a royal peculiar, not the seat of any bishop or a cathedral, but is led by a dean. The deans of Washington National Cathedral and St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin are likewise important clerics in their churches. =Rural or area deaneries= In many parts of the Anglican Communion, parishes are grouped together to form deaneries, each being a constituent administrative district of the diocese. Usually, a deanery is led by one of the incumbents of the deanery's parishes, who is called a rural dean, but in more urban areas this has often been replaced by the title area dean or regional dean. Such a dean chairs the meeting of the deanery's clergy (which, like a cathedral, is called a chapter), and may also chair a deanery synod. Rural Deans (and those known by alternative titles) rank as primi inter pares of their chapters, and do not have the seniority of cathedral or diocesan deans. =Other uses= The head of an Anglican theological college or seminary may also be called a dean (in common with its use in education). Catholic Church The title \\"dean\\" is conferred upon a pastor of a parish who serves as a senior figure, though usually without specific jurisdictional authority, over a section of a diocese. These are sometimes referred to as \\"rural deans\\", and are expected to show a degree of leadership among the pastors of the region, known as a deanery. This function is sometimes titled \\"vicar forane\\" (Latin forƒÅneus, \\"in a foreign land\\").https://educalingo.com/en/dic-en/vicar- forane#:~:text=ETYMOLOGY%20OF%20THE%20WORD%20VICAR,land%2C%20from%20Latin%20for%C4%81s%20outside. An episcopal vicar serves a similar function, but has more formal authority and specific powers under canon law. In recent years, the Catholic Church in England and Wales has introduced the custom of designating cathedral deans, formerly known as cathedral administrators. However, the term differs slightly from the Anglican usage as Catholic deans do not necessarily preside over the cathedral chapter (this function belonging to the office of Provost), and are not necessarily required even to be a member of the chapter. More commonly, in places throughout the world where a cathedral chapter has not been erected (as for instance, in the United States, where there are no chapters at all), the term rector is used for the priest who serves as chief administrator of a cathedral church. Another important use of the term within the Catholic Church is in the office of the Dean of the College of Cardinals, who serves as senior member of that body. The current dean is Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, approved on 18 January 2020. Lutheran Church Within the Lutheran tradition, particularly in the Nordic and Baltic tradition of evangelical episcopal Lutheranism, senior clergy bear the title 'Dean'. Each diocese usually has a cathedral Dean, in charge of the cathedral church, and a series of area deans to supervise the clergy in a given geographical area. In the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, there are also deans in charge of leading the administrative work and personnel of the Chapters.See for example the structure of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia here. United Methodism United Methodists often speak of a \\"dean\\" in terms of the dean of the cabinet. Every annual conference has a bishop's cabinet made up of the district superintendents under the bishop's appointment, as well as occasionally a few other conference officials. One of these superintendents is chosen by his or her colleagues to serve as the dean, usually for one year. This dean then has certain administrative and leadership responsibilities, and is accountable to the bishop. Other uses In various other religious denominations, the title \\"dean\\" may be used informally in its wider sense of a senior or venerated member of a congregation. The title may also used in its academic sense in parochial schools. References .

The lake basin, which formed at the efflux of the Nepean River from the Hawkesbury Sandstone (Sydney sandstone) gorge, is a popular swimming hole with a camping area and an education centre used by local school groups. Also featuring a large woodland area and native wildlife, the reserve is the only picnic area along the Nepean River and it is one of the most popular water-based picnic parks in Greater Western Sydney.Craven, P.J. (1983). Fauna survey of Bents Basin State Recreation Area. N S. W. Bents Basin State Recreation Area Trust. History Aboriginal Australians were denizens of the area due to its vicinity to the Nepean River, which featured food and water. The Basin is believed to have been a traditional meeting and trading place between Aboriginal groups. Having spiritual and cultural significance to Aboriginal communities, camps were used to provide an opportunity for Aboriginal people to connect with each other and their culture. Bents Basin was discovered in 1804 by the botanist George Caley, who named it 'Dovedale', where it has since then been a popular place for botanists. The site was originally a small natural basin formed in an erosion basin banked by sandstone outcrops, considerably enlarged with a large earth fill dam constructed by the Army's 17th Construction Squadron in 1987‚Äì88. A prominent inn was located within the park and is listed on the NSW State Heritage Inventory. The inn was built in the 1860s and the site is of local importance, as it gives details of western Sydney's history, early road networks and the rise and fall of rural communities in the region. Destroyed in the 1950s, the inn's location is marked by a pepper tree (Schinus areira). The Basin was reserved as State Recreation Area in 1994.Buchanan, R.A. ( 1979). Edge disturbance in natural areas. Australian Parks and Recreation. August, pp 39‚Äì43. Geography The Basin features a floodplain and is on a plateau. The basin is a circular lagoon-like pool that is across and over at its deepest, travelling about northeast (through Hawkesbury River) before reaching the ocean in Central Coast. Bents Basin is around 36km south of Penrith and 56km south-west of Sydney central business district. To the east of the basin is a cleared undulating paddock on the clay soils from the Wianamatta Shale of the Cumberland Plain. The Basin adjoins Gulguer Nature Reserve to the south. Two small creeks exist in the area. Large parts of the reserve are prone to flood. During flood events the basin is either fully closed or partially closed to all water-based activity because of hazardous conditions.Bannerman SA and Hazelton PA (1990) Soil Landscapes of the Penrith 1:100 000 Sheet Soil Conservation Service of NSW, Sydney and the accompanying map by Hazelton PA, Bannerman SM and Tille PJ (1989) Wildlife Animals species within the area include the Common bent-wing bat, sooty owl, Common wombat, East-coast free-tailed bat, powerful owl, large-eared pied bat and the glossy black cockatoo. The basin harbours 25 plant communities and around 360 plant species. Hibbertia hermanniifolia and Eucalyptus benthamii are both rare tree species present in the park.Benson, D.H. (1985).

Since its foundation in 1861, the company has expanded its product range across the cereal and ready-to-eat snack market. Uncle Tobys is currently operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Nestl√©, after being acquired in 2006. Uncle Tobys‚Äô main factory is situated in the town of Wahgunyah, Victoria. History During the gold rush in Victoria, brothers Zac and Josh Brennan left England and began manufacturing John Bull Oats in Melbourne. In 1861 they established Parsons Bros. which later became Uncle Tobys. Rolled oats were considered a commodity during the era and were mentioned in the financial columns of newspapers. Products The Uncle Tobys product suite is separated into three categories: Snacks, Oats and Cereals. The company sells different types of oats, such as traditional, super blend, and ancient grains. Other popular Uncle Tobys products include: Roll-ups, Cheerios, and snack bars.  Oats and Nutrition  80% of the oats used by Uncle Tobys Australia are of the Mikita variety. Mikita oats differ from conventional oats due to higher levels of disease resistance, increased yield potential, and increased levels of Œ≤-glucan. Mikita oats were developed at the South Australian Research Development Institute (SARDI), by the National Oat Breeding Program. The research was funded by the Uncle Tobys Corporation, in partnership with various governmental and corporate entities. Uncle Tobys sources 50% of its oats from local farms, which are within 100 km its main factory. In its corporate supply chain, Uncle Tobys exclusively utilises suppliers who have been certified as ‚ÄúLevel A‚Äù by the National Association of Sustainable Agriculture. Uncle Tobys often advertises the health benefits of its oats, calling them a ‚Äònatural superfood‚Äô. Monro et al. (2003) conducted research on three of Uncle Tobys oat bars (Break-Free Fruesli, Whole meal Fruit, and Chewy Muesli). The study found that: ‚ÄúDietary Fibre contents are consistent with recommendations for adult males made by the Standing Committee on the Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes of the Food and Nutrition Board‚Äù.  Nestle Acquisition  On the 23rd of May 2006, Nestl√© announced its acquisition of Uncle Tobys Australia‚Äîin addition to the brand rights in New Zealand‚Äîfor the total sum of $890 million Australian dollars. This buyout occurred at a valuation of 11.3 times the 2005 EBITDA, which was roughly 79 million AUD. The Uncle Tobys cereal business‚Äîwhich accounted for approximately 40% of its overall sales‚Äîwas bought by Cereal Partners Worldwide (a joint venture between and General Mills and Nestl√©). Other sections of the Uncle Tobys business, such as nutritious snacks and instant soups, were directly incorporated into Nestl√© Australia. Prior to this merger, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) published an analysis of the potential market impacts. In their competition analysis, it was determined that ‚Äúthe acquisition would be unlikely to substantially lessen competition in markets for nutritious snacks and breakfast cereals‚Äù. Following this analysis, authorisation was granted for the corporate acquisition.  Advertising Malpractice  On the 13th of September 2006, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission mandated that Uncle Tobys stop advertising that its fruit roll-ups are ‚ÄòMade with 65% real fruit‚Äô. The chairman of the commission released a statement saying; ‚ÄúThe ACCC was concerned that the Roll-Ups composition was being misrepresented to consumers‚Äù. After the announcement, Uncle Tobys altered its advertising practices to remove the aforementioned phrase. Uncle Tobys was prevented from suggesting that Roll-Ups are equivalent to any percentage of fresh fruit and was prevented from running an advertisement that showed an apple being compacted into a fruit Roll-up. After the mandate, the ACCC required Uncle Tobys to publish an article for the food industry, emphasising the importance of advertising standards. In the article, Uncle Tobys states: ‚ÄúThe Key learning from this experience was that in making representations to consumers, we have to carefully consider how consumers might view both representations on packaging and the overall impression created by all the aspects of product marketing, including labels, branding and advertising‚Äù. On the 26th of November 2015, Cereal Partners Australia paid a fine of $32,400 to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Prior to this payment, the ACCC had issued Cereal Partners Australia with three infringement notices. The commission issued infringement notices because it had reason to believe that Cereal Partners Australia had violated Australian Consumer Law, by misrepresenting the protein content within Uncle Tobys oat products. The commission alleged that the packaging ‚Äúmade false or misleading representations that the oats in these Uncle Tobys products contained a significant amount of protein, which is not the case‚Äù. Uncle Tobys had included a disclaimer with the packaging, but this did not impact the verdict.  Swim my Way Initiative  Historically, the Uncle Tobys brand has been closely associated with swimming. In 1983, the company sponsored its first athlete‚ÄîLisa Curry‚Äîa swimmer at the commonwealth games. Currently, Uncle Tobys has two brand ambassadors: Olympic Champions Cate and Bronte Campbell. Uncle Tobys, in collaboration with Royal Life Saving Australia, previously launched a swimming campaign. The program is named ‚ÄòSwim My Way‚Äô and was launched on the 6th of March 2018. The aim of this program is to promote swimming to all Australians, regardless of their age demographic.  Product Recall  On the 10th of January 2020, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) issued a product recall for a number of Uncle Tobys products. The recall affected four flavours of fruit roll-ups; including passionfruit, rainbow berry, rainbow fruit salad, and fun-prints strawberry (Food Standards Australia New Zealand, 2020). The product recall was due to equipment failure within one of Nestle's production facilities, which created the possibility for there to be foreign matter (small metal fragments) in the product. Customers who purchased the recalled batches were entitled to a full refund.

Bess is said to have been intelligent, forthright, passionate, and courageous. In due course, she and Raleigh, at least 11 years her senior, fell in love. In her book, The Life of Elizabeth I (1998), the British author and historian Alison Weir states Throckmorton and Raleigh's first child was conceived by July 1591, the couple were married \\"in great secrecy\\" in the autumn of 1591, and their son was born in March 1592. The boy was christened Damerei, after Sir Walter's claimed ancestors, the D'Ameries. Damerei is believed to have died of the plague during infancy. Weir states that Queen Elizabeth first became aware in May 1592 of the secret marriage and of Damerei's birth, despite Bess and Sir Walter's denials. The couple had married without royal permission, but, significantly, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, was in on the secret and acting as godfather to the Raleighs' son. Once the queen found out, she first placed Bess and Raleigh under house arrest, then sent them to the Tower of London, in June 1592. Raleigh was released from the Tower in August 1592 and Bess in December 1592, at which time she joined her husband at Sherborne Castle, his Dorset estate. Elizabeth expected the couple to sue for pardon, but they refused to, and Raleigh remained out of favour for five years. The couple remained devoted to each other, although, according to Weir, Bess proved to be a domineering wife. Anna Beer, Lady Raleigh's biographer, offers a different perspective, pointing out that due to Raleigh's frequent absences, whether on expeditions, diplomatic duties, or in prison, Bess had to shoulder an unusual level of responsibility for a woman of her time. The Raleighs‚Äô second son, Walter, was born in 1593 at Sherborne. The couple's third son was born in January 1605, by which time Raleigh was again a prisoner in the Tower of London. Named Carew, which was both Bess' mother's maiden name and the name of one of Raleigh's brothers, he was christened within the walls of the Tower in the church of St Peter ad Vincula. After Raleigh's execution in 1618, Bess worked tirelessly to re-establish her late husband's reputation and, in 1628, saw a Bill of Restitution restore the Raleigh name 'in blood', which allowed her one surviving son to inherit. Bess is said to have had her husband's head embalmed and to have carried it around with her for the rest of her life, although the only documented reference to Raleigh's head is from the day of his execution, when it was noted that Lady Raleigh and her ladies left the scene carrying Sir Walter's head in a red bag. An account from 1740 claims that, after Bess' death, Raleigh's head was returned to his tomb in St Margaret's, Westminster. However, even if this were true, it remains unclear where Raleigh's body was buried: it may have been released to Bess, as per her request, or even sent to Exeter, where his parents were buried. Through both her parents, Bess had connections to Henry VIII. Her father, Nicholas Throckmorton, was the cousin of Henry's sixth wife, Queen Catherine Parr. Anne Carew, Elizabeth's mother, was the daughter of Nicholas Carew and Elizabeth Carew n√©e Bryan. Nicholas had been a close friend of Henry's, from childhood until his execution in 1539. In her aforementioned book, Weir alleges that Elizabeth Carew had earlier been Henry VIII's mistress, and that he had given her jewels that should technically have belonged to the queen when the queen gave birth to her son. However, there exist no contemporaneous references to a possibility that any of Elizabeth's children were fathered by Henry. Fictional depictions Bessie Throckmorton is a major character in Edward German's operetta Merrie England (1902). Norah Lofts in her 1936 fictionalized biography of Walter Raleigh, Here Was a Man, depicted a full-fledged love triangle, with the two Elizabeths - the Queen and the much younger Lady in Waiting - fiercely competing for Walter Raleigh's love and deeply hating each other. There is no clear historical evidence that things went that far. In later parts of the book, Elizabeth Raleigh is depicted as trying to get Walter to leave the court and live quietly with her at Sherborne, and feeling neglected and abandoned when he returned to the Queen's favor, and as loyally standing by him during his disgrace under King James and voluntarily sharing his twelve years of imprisonment in the Tower. In the film The Virgin Queen (1955), Elizabeth Throckmorton (referred to as Beth Throgmorton in the film) is portrayed by Joan Collins, Queen Elizabeth by Bette Davis. Elizabeth Throckmorton is the subject of Rosemary Sutcliff's novel Lady in Waiting (1956). Sutcliff usually refers to her as \\"Bess\\". She is mentioned in Elizabeth Goudge's \\"Towers in the mist\\" (1936), set in Oxford in 1566, also as Bess. This is anachronistic as she would have been only an infant at the time. She appears briefly in A Dead Man in Deptford (1993), Anthony Burgess' speculative fictional account of the life of playwright Christopher Marlowe. Elizabeth \\"Bess\\" Throckmorton, portrayed by Abbie Cornish, was a featured character in the film Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007). This sequel to Elizabeth (1998) focuses on the relationships of Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett) and Bess with Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), and shows Bess and Raleigh marrying prior to the Spanish Armada (1588), though in fact the couple married in 1591. She appears briefly in Deborah Harkness' novel Shadow of Night (2012) as Queen Elizabeth's lady-in-waiting and Walter Raleigh's lover. Elizabeth Throckmorton, played by actress Phoebe Thomas, appears in the BBC 2 three-part drama documentary series Armada: 12 Days to Save England (2015) as lady-in- waiting to Queen Elizabeth (Anita Dobson), whom the Queen calls 'Bess'. One scene shows the Queen's jealousy of Bess when she realises, from seeing her wearing a brooch, that Bess has a male admirer unknown to the Queen. Another scene shows the Queen's paranoia about the great danger she feels she is in while the Armada is attacking England, with the Queen forcing Bess to taste her food to check for poison.

Started in the early 1830s near Peachtree Creek, it was run by Hardy Pace, one of the city's founders. It was an important transportation link to northwestern Georgia, especially prior to the construction of the State Road (the Western & Atlantic Railroad) to Chattanooga. In Vinings (formerly Paces), Pace's Mill was a gristmill begun by Hardy Pace, founded to diversify his holdings after the railroad was built. The short Paces Mill Road still exists today. Just across the river is Paces, the northwesternmost neighborhood of Atlanta. During the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War, the Battle of Pace's Ferry was fought July 5, 1864. Paces Ferry Road The original Pace's Ferry Road was begun during the Georgia Gold Rush as a stage coach bringing people from Decatur to Vinings, where they could continue on to gold country. The road went southeast from the river to Irbyville (later Irby, now Buckhead), then following what is now called \\"Old Decatur Road\\", then Cheshire Bridge Road, through what is now Emory University on Clifton Road, along Haygood Drive then North Decatur Road until that hits Clairmont Road, which was then known as the Shallowford Road. In modern times, Paces Ferry Road (dropping the apostrophe) is still an important east‚Äìwest route across northern Atlanta. West Paces Ferry Road runs from the center of Buckhead Village as far west as a dead-end in Paces, while Paces Ferry Road splits off to the northwest at Nancy Creek and runs across the river to Vinings in Cobb County, where it is the address for the world headquarters of The Home Depot. Beginning at Atlanta Road and going east, it crosses I-285 at mile 18, and heads into historic Vinings where it crosses the Chattahoochee River. This river crossing is very near the old ferry location, just down from the 1904 bridge that replaced the ferry. That first wooden bridge had been used for pedestrians since being replaced by a concrete one in the early 1970s. At the river, Paces Ferry Road enters Fulton County and the Atlanta city limits and continues to its terminus at the western end of Atlanta's Buckhead area. Here, West Paces Ferry Road continues under I-75 at mile 255, and heads east through some of Atlanta's oldest and wealthiest Buckhead neighborhoods. It serves as the address of the Georgia Governor's Mansion as well many of Atlanta's other stately older mansions and estates. Unlike many of metro Atlanta's newer suburbs, the area along this street has maintained most of its forest cover, also making it a pleasant and scenic drive. It emerges from this canopy at the center of Buckhead, meeting Peachtree Road at the southern end of Roswell Road. After passing Georgia 9 and U.S. 19 (both routed on Peachtree to the south and Roswell to the north), it becomes East Paces Ferry Road. It stops at Piedmont Road (Georgia 237), then continues very slightly northward on the other side as a residential street. The tolled section of the Georgia 400 expressway, finished in 1993, made this a dead-end road in the early 1990s. It resumes on the other side of the tollway, along the southeastern edge of Lenox Square, the city's first indoor shopping mall. The road then ends east-northeast of Lenox Road at Roxboro Road, but is named Railroad Avenue for these last three blocks past Lenox Road and the Lenox MARTA station, immediately northeast of where the north and northeast lines split.

The recession affected the European Union during 2000 and 2001 and the United States from March to November 2001. The UK, Canada and Australia avoided the recession, while Russia, a nation that did not experience prosperity during the 1990s, in fact began to recover from said situation. Japan's 1990s recession continued. This recession was predicted by economists, because the boom of the 1990s (accompanied by both low inflation and low unemployment) slowed in some parts of East Asia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The recession in industrialized countries was not as significant as either of the two previous worldwide recessions. Some economists in the United States object to characterizing it as a recession since there were no two consecutive quarters of negative growth. United States U shaped recession with growth remaining weak from 2000-III to 2003-I. ; rightthumb300px After the relatively mild 1990 recession ended in early 1991, the country hit a belated unemployment rate peak of 7.8% in mid-1992. Job growth was initially muted by large layoffs among defense related industries. However, payrolls accelerated in 1992 and experienced robust growth through 2000. Predictions that the bubble would burst emerged during the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Predictions about a future burst increased following the October 27, 1997 mini-crash, in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. This caused an uncertain economic climate during the first few months of 1998. However conditions improved, and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times between June 1999 and May 2000 in an effort to cool the economy to achieve a soft landing. The burst of the stock market bubble occurred in the form of the NASDAQ crash in March 2000. Growth in gross domestic product slowed considerably in the third quarter of 2000 to the lowest rate since a contraction in the first quarter of 1992. The NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee has determined that a peak in business activity occurred in the U.S. economy in March 2001. A peak marks the end of an expansion and the beginning of a recession. The determination of a peak date in March is thus a determination that the expansion that began in March 1991 ended in March 2001 and a recession began. The expansion lasted exactly 10 years, the longest in the NBER's chronology. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which is the private, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization charged with determining economic recessions, the U.S. economy was in recession from March 2001 to November 2001, a period of eight months at the beginning of President George W. Bush's term of office. However, economic conditions did not satisfy the common shorthand definition of recession, which is \\"a fall of a country's real gross domestic product in two or more successive quarters\\", and has led to some confusion about the procedure for determining the starting and ending dates of a recession. The NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee (BCDC) uses monthly, rather than quarterly, indicators to determine peaks and troughs in business activity,https://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions.html, retrieved 8 April 2008 as can be seen by noting that starting and ending dates are given by month and year, not quarters. However, controversy over the precise dates of the recession led to the characterization of the recession as the \\"Clinton Recession\\" by Republicans, if it could be traced to the final term of President Bill Clinton. BCDC members suggested they would be open to revisiting the dates of the recession as newer and more definitive data became available.Henderson, Nell (January 22, 2004). Economists Say Recession Started in 2000. The Washington Post. In early 2004, NBER President Martin Feldstein said: However, the NBER has since confirmed that the recession started in March 2001. From 2000 to 2001, the Federal Reserve, in a move to protect the economy from the overvalued stock market, made successive interest rate increases; while this may have initiated the readjustment, it is starkly contrasted with the severe, prolonged recession that would have occurred had the unsustainable growth continued unabated.Ruddy, Christopher (January 31, 2006)Alan Greenspan's Real Legacy . Newsmax. Retrieved on July 8, 2009. Using the stock market as an unofficial benchmark, a recession would have begun in March 2000 when the NASDAQ crashed following the collapse of the dot-com bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was relatively unscathed by the NASDAQ's crash until the September 11, 2001 attacks, after which the DJIA suffered its worst one-day point loss and biggest one-week losses in history up to that point. The market rebounded, only to crash once more in the final two quarters of 2002. In the final three quarters of 2003, the market finally rebounded permanently, agreeing with the unemployment statistics that a recession defined in this way would have lasted from 2001 through 2003. The Labor Department estimates that a net 1.735 million jobs were shed in 2001, with an additional net 508,000 lost during 2002. 2003 saw a small gain of a mere 105,000 jobs. Unemployment rose from 4.2% in February 2001 to 5.5% in November 2001, but did not peak until June 2003 at 6.3%, after which it declined to 5% by mid-2005. Canada Canada's economy is closely linked to that of the United States, and economic conditions south of the border tend to quickly make their way north. Canada's stock markets were especially hard hit by the collapse in high-tech stocks. For much of the 1990s the rapid rise of the TSX had almost wholly been attributed to two stocks: Nortel and BCE. Both companies were hard hit by the downturn, especially Nortel, which was forced to lay off much of its workforce. The events of September 11 also hurt the Canadian stock markets and were especially devastating to the already troubled airline sector. However, in the wider economy, Canada was surprisingly unhurt by these events. While growth slowed, the economy never actually entered a recession. This was the first time that Canada had avoided following the United States into an economic downturn. The rate of job creation in Canada continued at the rapid pace of the 1990s. A number of explanations have been advanced to explain this. Canada was not as directly affected by 9/11 and the subsequent wars, and the downward pressure of these events was more muted. Canada's fiscal management during the period has been praised as the federal government continued to bring in large surpluses throughout this period, in sharp contrast to the United States. Unlike the United States no major tax cuts or major new expenditures were introduced. However, during this time, Canada did pursue an expansionary monetary policy in an effort to reduce the effects of a possible recession. Many provincial governments suffered greater problems with a number of them returning to deficits, which was blamed on the fiscal imbalance. 2003 saw elections in six Canadian provinces and in only one did the governing party not lose seats. Russia The Soviet Union's last year of economic growth was 1989, and throughout the 1990s, recession ensued in the Former Soviet Republics. In May 1998, following the 1997 crash of the East Asian economy, things began to get even worse in Russia. In August 1998, the value of the ruble fell 34% and people clamored to get their money out of banks (see 1998 Russian financial crisis). The government acted by dragging its feet on privatization programs. Russians responded to this situation with approval by electing the more pro-dirigist and less liberal Vladimir Putin as President in 2000. Putin proceeded to reassert the role of the federal government, and gave it power it had not seen since the Soviet era. State-run businesses were used to out-compete some of the more wealthy rivals of Putin. Putin's policies were popular with the Russian people, gaining him re-election in 2004. At the same time, the export-oriented Russian economy enjoyed considerable influx of foreign currency thanks to rising worldwide oil prices (from $15 per barrel in early 1999 to an average of $30 per barrel during Putin's first term). The early 2000s recession was avoided in Russia due to rebound in exports and, to some degree, a return to dirigisme. Japan Japan's recession, which started in the early 1990s, continued into the 2000s, with deflation being the main problem. Deflation began plaguing Japan in the fiscal year ending 1999, and by 2005 the yen had 103% of its 2000 buying power. The Bank of Japan attempted to cultivate inflation with high liquidity and a nominal 0% interest rate on loans. Other aspects of the Japanese economy were good during the early 2000s; unemployment remained relatively low, and China became somewhat dependent on the Japanese exports. The bear market, however, continued in Japan, despite the best efforts of the Bank. European Union The ECB prime rate is largely lowered starting from 2001. Transition left the economy of the European Union in a cautiously optimistic state during the early 2000s. The most difficult years were 2000‚Äì2001, precipitating the worst years of the American recession. The European Union introduced a new currency on January 1, 1999. The euro, which was met with much anticipation, had its value immediately plummet, and it continued to be a weak currency throughout 2000 and 2001. Inflation struck the Eurozone for a few months in summer 2001 but the economy deflated within months. In 2002, the value of the euro began to rapidly rise (reaching parity with the US dollar on July 15, 2002). This hurt business for companies based in Europe, as the profits made abroad (especially in the Americas) had an unfavorable exchange rate. France and Germany both entered recession towards the end of 2001, but in May 2002 both countries declared that their recessions had ended after a mere six months each. Both economies suffered from global tech crash with the ruling German party introducing the then unpopular austerity, tax cuts and labor reforms nicknamed Hartz concept to boost the German economy in wake of an economic slump that would persist until the mid-2000s with unemployment peaking in early 2005 of 12.7%. However, some European Union countries ‚Äì including the United Kingdom ‚Äì managed to delay sliding into recession until the late 2000s.

He wrote many of the band's biggest hits, including \\"Questions 67 & 68\\", \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\", \\"Beginnings\\", \\"25 or 6 to 4\\", \\"Saturday in the Park\\", \\"Dialogue (Part I & II)\\" and \\"Harry Truman\\". Lamm is one of three founding members (alongside James Pankow and Lee Loughnane) still performing with the group. Biography Lamm (center) performing with Earth, Wind & Fire on keytar Lamm was born on October 13, 1944, in Brooklyn, New York City. His parents had a collection of jazz records, which were an early influence on him. As a youth, he performed in the boys' and men's choir at Grace Episcopal Church in Brooklyn Heights. In a 2003 interview, Lamm said, \\"My first musical training came as a member of that choir. It exposed me to some of the great sacred music from the Middle Ages, right up through Bach and into the 20th century composers.\\" His mother eventually remarried, resulting in Lamm moving to Chicago, Illinois, when he was 15 years old. He studied art in high school, particularly drawing and painting, but changed direction in college by enrolling in the music program at Roosevelt University in Chicago. In 1967, Lamm was one of the six founding members of a ‚Äúrock band with horns‚Äù - soon to be known as Chicago. After recording six overwhelmingly successful albums, in 1974, Lamm released Skinny Boy, the only solo album from a member of Chicago before the 1980s. Lamm seemingly drifted into a period of both personal and professional frustration. He emerged in 1982 with a new attitude.Interview with musician Jim Newsom for PortFolio Weekly, a Virginia regional magazine of news, opinion, arts and culture, July 15, 2003 A number of solo albums began to appear after Lamm relocated back to New York in 1991. He formed a trio (Beckley-Lamm-Wilson) with Gerry Beckley of the band America and Carl Wilson of The Beach Boys. After Wilson's death from lung cancer in February 1998, an album was released entitled Like a Brother (2000). All of these solo albums and songs were in addition to the continued semi-active recordings by Chicago, Stone of Sisyphus, Night and Day, Chicago XXX, and Chicago Now 36. Lamm has been a guest lecturer on music production at Stanford University. In 2012, he lectured at New York University on the subject of songwriting. Instruments In Chicago's early years, Lamm used a simple setup of Hammond organ and Wurlitzer Electric Piano. After the band's first tour of Europe, he began using a Hohner Pianet. Initially, his use of the grand piano was limited to the studio until he began to use one more regularly on stage, purchasing a Steinway Model D Concert Grand by the early 1970s. The Fender Rhodes electric piano became a favorite around 1972. Around 1973‚Äì1974 he added a Mellotron and Hohner clavinet in his keyboard rig, and also incorporated Moog and ARP synthesizers. In the late 1970s, he also started using the Yamaha CS-80 synthesizer and possibly a Sequential Circuits Prophet 5. According to an interview with Keyboard Magazine in 1979, he discovered that he no longer needed the Hammond organ after starting to play the CS80, so he retired it. On a 1980 TV appearance, he played a grand piano with a Multimoog synthesizer above it. He then accessed various synthesizer sound modules via MIDI keyboard controllers such as Yamaha, Kawai, Rhodes, and a Yamaha keytar. Beginning in the late 1980s, he began using the Lync LN1000 keytar. As his primary keyboard, these days, he prefers the Yamaha Motif ES8 keyboard.

History  The Shark Island Challenge first started in 1997, and was a very informal and local event organized by Nathan Purcell and Mark Fordham. The championship would get increasing attention in the following years and was promoted to an international World Tour event sanctioned by the International Bodyboarding Association (IBA) in 2002, eventually turning out to be the premiere event of the tour when the Teahuppo Challenge was eliminated due to lack of financial sponsoring. =Results and conditions=  1997  * Organizers: Nathan Purcell, Mark Fordham * Waiting Period: Best day in May, later changed to best day in June due to lack of swell * Format: 12 local riders vs. 12 invitees from Australia * Results and prizes  1.

Comments from the riders gives the notion that it was more like free-surfing. It could be argued that the low money prize and the fact that it did not scored points for the World Tour contributed to this relaxed feeling toward the competition in this year.  1998  * Organizers: Nathan Purcell, Mark Fordham * Waiting Period: 1 July to 1 August (1 ‚Äì 2 days event depending on conditions) * Format: 12 local riders vs. 12 invitees from Australia, 2 rounds event * Results and prizes  1.

Many stand-out invitees had to drop the contest due to previous scheduled trips (Mike Stewart, Spencer Skipper, Jeff Hubbard and Andre Botha). On Monday the 5th of July, with only six days left in the window, an unexpected 4 ‚Äì 6 foot swell created perfect conditions for the Island. This was so unexpected that some prominent riders missed their heats (Steve Mackenzie, Paul Barnard and Damian King). The Island didn't break again with good condition to the end of the waiting period and the final results were taken from the first round scores.

It has been the top-selling margarine brand since 1973 and was the second polyunsaturated margarine in Australia; the first was Miracle by Marrickville Holdings (now owned by Unilever). History The Meadow Lea brand was founded by Oliver Triggs in 1932, in Enmore, Sydney, but had its origins about four years earlier in Richmond, Melbourne, where Triggs owned a small grocery store.Sydney Morning Herald obituary, 1962 (and other press articles). In about 1934 Triggs hired James (Jim) Armstrong as a sales manager, on commission, for country regions in New South Wales. In 1941 Triggs and Armstrong reached an agreement whereby Armstrong would sell his roughly 25% sales commission share in the Meadow Lea Margarine Company to Triggs' son Kenneth (Ken) when he turned 21 in 1945. Accordingly, Armstrong sold his commission interests in Meadow Lea to Ken Triggs in 1945, and retired from the company. In about 1956, Oliver and Ken Triggs sold the Meadow Lea Margarine Company to Vegetable Oils Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the publicly listed company Allied Mills Ltd. On 30 April 1986 Allied Mills was taken over by Fielder Gillespie Davis Limited, part of the Goodman Group Ltd (New Zealand), to create Goodman Fielder Ltd. In 1987 Goodman Fielder purchased Wattie Industries Ltd (New Zealand), becoming Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd, only to divest Wattie Foods to H. J. Heinz Company in 1992 and return to being called Goodman Fielder Ltd. In 2003 Goodman Fielder was acquired by Burns, Philp & Company Limited, being relisted again in 2005. Products In 2010 the MeadowLea product range consisted of six varieties: * Original * Salt Reduced * Canola * Light * Extra Light * Dairy Free Oliver Triggs Oliver Francis Triggs (1895‚Äì1962) founded the Meadow Lea table margarine brand by 1932 and was the first person in Australia to manufacture table margarine, finally selling Meadow Lea to Allied Mills in about 1956. Triggs was born in Melbourne on a small farm, fought with the Light Horse in World War I, then trained as a tailor, before opening a corner grocery shop and making copha butter. After copha butter was banned in Victoria to support the butter industry and pure butter sales, Triggs moved to Sydney in about 1931. He was married to Nita Alice Bek (1895‚Äì1974) and had four children, Kenneth, Audray and Marian (twins), and Jill. From about 1935 until 1975, the family home was Edgewater, 3 Sutherland Crescent, Darling Point, bought from the Wirth Bros Circus family. Its water front gardens (including a tennis court and swimming pool) were sold to the neighbouring Carthona in the 1950s, when Edgewater was divided into three homes (one on each floor) with Triggs retaining the top floor. In about 1939‚Äì45 Triggs owned the 2,000-acre Kyalla Park sheep farm and horse stud near Orange, which had the first electrified sheep-shearing shed in Australia (built in about 1910 by the previous owners, the Stuart family). The property was slowly subdivided and sold off by its subsequent owner, so that it is now around 150 acres, and has been owned since about 1980 by the Napier family. Ken Triggs Kenneth Oliver Triggs OAM (1924 ‚Äì ), the only son of Oliver Triggs, was a director and 25% shareholder in Meadow Lea from 1945 until the company's sale to Vegetable Oils Pty Ltd in about 1956. He subsequently became a farmer and Chairman of the NSW Egg Board, a manufacturer of polystyrene containers, Chairman of Mutual Home Loans Fund of Australia Limited and Information Electronics Limited. In 2003 he became the Secretary of the Auburn sub-Branch of the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL), and was made a Life Member of the RSL in 2008. He received the Order of Australia Medal in 2011 for service to veterans and their families. He married Ruth Donnison in 1950 and they had two sons, David and Andrew. The couple divorced in about 1976, and in about 1985 Triggs married Lesley-Anne Woodward. Meadow Lea house The Art Deco heritage listed residential home named Meadow Lea at 22 Sydney Road, East Lindfield, Sydney, was built on four housing lots and completed in about 1941 for James Armstrong, at the time the sales manager of the Meadow Lea Margarine Company. It was sold in 1948 for ¬£17,000 to Azzalin Romano, of the nightclub restaurant Romanos, who had sold his racehorse Bernborough in 1946 to Louis B. Mayer for ¬£93,000. In 1955 the house was sold for ¬£25,000. In 1996 it was purchased by Daniel Kalanderian, the co-founder of the large Sydney store, Victoria's Basement, who added a new wing and put it on the market in September 2010 for $7.5 million.Belle Property website listing, September 2010.

It is generally served hot. In some establishments the sandwich will be made from bread toasted on only one side, while other establishments serve it on the same roll as is used for hamburgers. Bacon sandwiches are an all-day favourite throughout the United Kingdom. They are often served in British cafes, and are anecdotally recommended as a hangover cure. Variants The New York Times-London Journal reported on a study conducted at Leeds University which consisted of testing 700 variants of the sandwich. They experimented with different cooking styles, types of bacon, breads, oils, and special additions. Each variant was then ranked by 50 tasters. In conclusion, the best bacon sandwiches are made with \\"crispy, fried, and not- too-fat bacon between thick slices of white bread.\\" Another study by the Direct Line for Business listed the top additions to the traditional bacon butty in England. Although the original was still the preferred sandwich, the next top contender was the \\"breggy\\" which adds an egg. The next popular accessory was mushrooms, followed by cheese. For sauces, brown sauce was slightly favoured over ketchup. The BLT is a popular variant of the bacon sandwich with the additional ingredients of lettuce and tomato, but served cold.

A study in 2007 conducted by the World Cancer Research Fund found that there was \\"convincing evidence\\" of a link between processed meats and an increased chance of cancer. Although no numerical value was provided for the risk, they did state that \\"people should not eat more than 500g of red meat a week.\\" The World Health Organization released a warning concerning the sodium content in bacon. For 100g of bacon, there are approximately 1,500 mg of sodium. Currently, the FDA reports that the average American adult should consume less than 2,300 mg per day.

Counting the lake would add to the river's length. The Mascoma River begins at Cummins Pond in a heavily forested part of the town of Dorchester, New Hampshire and flows south into the town of Canaan, collecting water flowing from Reservoir Pond, Clark Pond, and Canaan Street Lake before reaching the Indian River. Here it turns west, collecting tributaries arriving from Goose Pond and Crystal Lake, before it passes through the mill town of Enfield and arrives at Mascoma Lake. At the western end of Mascoma Lake, the Mascoma River, now in Lebanon, drops quickly over rapids and occasional falls, passing numerous small hydroelectric dams in the center of Lebanon and on its way to West Lebanon, where it reaches the Connecticut River. The section of the river immediately downstream of the Mascoma Lake dam is reserved for fly fishing only, while other portions of the river are open for all types of fisherman.

Admission to the school usually involves taking a test, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV) for children under six years old, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V) for children six years old and older.  Use of Common Core Standards  Nueva is a student-centered school known for its distinctive inquiry-based, interdisciplinary, project-based studies. Since 1967, Nueva has been a leader in education of special students and dedicated to its mission to inspire passion for lifelong learning, foster social and emotional acuity, and develop each student's imaginative mind. Notable programs include a rich music program designed, in part, by Sir Yehudi Menuhin working with Dr. Genevieve Fitzmaurice. The school's social emotional learning (SEL) curriculum has been part of a Nueva education since its founding, originally called Self-science. The SEL curriculum was developed in large part by Janice Toben. With the development of the I-Lab in 2007, Nueva was one of the first Design Thinking programs for PreK-8, now PreK-12 students, providing every student with training in design thinking methodology, engineering classes, projects, and practices that are now central to Nueva's learning approach.  Annual School Trips  Another element of a Nueva education is the annual trips program, further enabling students to live Nueva's motto of \\"Learn by Doing, Learn by Caring.\\" Each year for grades one through twelve, students have a school trip. For first grade it is a one-night sleepover in the ballroom community space. For second, third, and fourth, students go on grade level camping trips. The second-grade trip is two days long, the third- grade trip is three days, and the fourth-grade trip is four. Fifth-grade students visit Crow Canyon Archaeological Center and the Four Corners region. Sixth grade students travel to Washington, DC. Seventh-grade students backpack in Yosemite National Park for five days, and then take a four-day trip to Ashland, Oregon, to attend the Shakespeare festival.

Sheppard announced more than 4,500 Yankees baseball games over a period of 56 years, including 22 pennant-winning seasons and 13 World Series championships; he called 121 consecutive postseason contests, 62 games in 22 World Series, and six no-hitters, including three perfect games. He was also the in-house voice for New York Giants football games for more than a half- century , encompassing nine conference championships, three NFL championships (1956, 1986, 1990), and the game often called \\"the greatest ever played\\", the classic 1958 championship loss to Baltimore. Sheppard's smooth, distinctive baritone and precise, consistent elocution became iconic aural symbols of both the old Yankee Stadium and Giants Stadium. Reggie Jackson famously nicknamed him \\"The Voice of God\\", and Carl Yastrzemski once said, \\"You're not in the big leagues until Bob Sheppard announces your name.\\" Early life Sheppard was secretive about his age throughout his life, but according to New York voter records he was born October 20, 1910, in Richmond Hill, Queens, New York City. He graduated from Saint John's Preparatory School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn in 1928, and attended St. John's University on an athletic scholarship, where he earned seven varsity letters from 1928 to 1932; three in baseball as the starting first baseman, and four in football as the left- handed starting quarterback. He was also elected president of his senior class. In 1933, he received a master's degree in speech education from Columbia University. Teacher Sheppard began his career playing semiprofessional football on Long Island with the Valley Stream Red Riders and the Hempstead Monitors, earning $25 a game, and teaching speech at Grover Cleveland High School in Ridgewood, Queens, New York. During World War II he served in the Navy as a gunnery officer aboard cargo ships, both in convoys and on independent missions in the Pacific Theater. After the War he became Chairman of the Speech Department at John Adams High School in Queens, and taught evening courses in public speaking at his alma mater, St. John's University. He also served as speech and debate coach for Sacred Heart Academy's Forensic Team in Hempstead, New York.Priesler, Jerome: An Interview with Bob Sheppard. Yes Network Retrieved July 15, 2010. His multiple teaching jobs overlapped more than 25 years into his announcing career, and he always maintained that his academic work was far more important than his accomplishments as an announcer. \\"My sports activity\\", he said,\\"...cut down on what I really contributed to society, and that's teaching...when I hear from former students and they say I helped them achieve their goals, I feel I have contributed to society more than all I have done in sports.\\" As an announcer, he said, \\"All I have to recommend is longevity.\\"Remembering Bob Sheppard (July 12, 2010). WABC.com Retrieved July 14, 2010. Announcer After World War II, Sheppard was hired as the public address announcer for St. John's football and basketball games, a job he kept well into the 1990s. In the late 1940s, he became the announcer for the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference at Ebbets Field. He came to the attention of the Yankees when a front-office official heard him deliver a tribute to Babe Ruth at a Dodgers football game in 1948. He was offered the Yankees announcing job, but did not accept it until three years later when the Yankees agreed to hire an understudy, so that his duties with the team would not interfere with his teaching responsibilities. He debuted at Yankee Stadium on April 17, 1951 with the Yankees' home opener, a 5‚Äì0 win over the Boston Red Sox. In 1956, when the New York Giants football team moved from the Polo Grounds to Yankee Stadium, he began announcing their games as well, and remained with them when they moved to Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey in 1976. Sheppard's first year as the Yankees' announcer was the only one in which Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle shared the outfield. His first game featured eight future Hall of Famers: DiMaggio, Mantle, Johnny Mize, Yogi Berra, and Phil Rizzuto for the Yankees, and Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and Lou Boudreau for the Red Sox. The first player he introduced was the Yankee Clipper's brother, Dominic DiMaggio. His 1951 salary was $15 per game, $17 for a doubleheader.Whose Voice Is That? whosevoice.org Retrieved July 19, 2010.

Each in-game announcement began: \\"Your attention please, ladies and gentlemen.\\" He introduced every player, Yankee or visitor (as described on his Monument Park plaque), \\"with equal divine reverence.\\" He communicated the players' position, uniform number, name, and repeated the number, during his first at-bat (\\"Now batting for the Yankees, the first baseman, number 23, Don Mattingly, number 23\\"), while announcing the players' position and name during each succeeding at-bat (\\"The first baseman, Don Mattingly\\").The Voice of God (July 14, 2010).

What can I do with Mickey Klutts?\\" But Mickey Mantle remained his favorite; Sheppard said Mantle once told him, \\"'Every time Bob Sheppard introduced me at Yankee Stadium, I got shivers up my spine.' And I said to him, 'So did I.'\\" Sheppard took great pride in pronouncing every name correctly, and made certain to check directly with a visiting player if he had any doubt on the correct or preferred pronunciation. He admitted that early in his career, whenever the Senators were in town he particularly feared tripping over Wayne Terwilliger's name. \\"I worried that I would say 'Ter-wigg-ler'\\", he recalled, \\"but I never did.\\" He did stumble on at least one rookie's name: Jorge Posada was called up from Columbus late in the 1995 season, and made his first appearance as a Yankee in Game 2 of the 1995 American League Division Series against Seattle, as a pinch runner for Wade Boggs.Longtime Yankee Stadium Announcer Dies (July 12, 2010). democratandchronicle.com Retrieved July 21, 2010.

Sheppard made another rare professional error in October 1976 at the Giants' first home game in New Jersey at Giants Stadium against the Cowboys, which he commenced with the startling announcement, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Yankee Stadium.\\" His other famous faux pas occurred in 1982 at Yankee Stadium, when he inadvertently left his microphone on as Shane Rawley gave up a double on his first pitch in relief, instantly turning a 3‚Äì2 lead into a 4‚Äì3 deficit. Over the stadium speakers came Sheppard's familiar voice: \\"Boy, what relief pitchinginginging!\\" Sheppard, ever the gentleman, went to the locker room after the game and apologized to Rawley. Throughout his career, Sheppard famously refused to reveal his age, once abruptly ending an interview when Jim Bouton asked the question a second time. He readily disclosed his birth month and day, October 20 (possibly because he shared it with Mickey Mantle), but never publicly acknowledged the year. For years, there was conjecture that his compulsive secretiveness stemmed from a fear that Yankees owner George Steinbrenner would think him too old and replace him, but Sheppard denied it. \\"[Steinbrenner] never questioned how old I was\\", he said. \\"He knew I was there every day for 57 years or so.\\"Sheppard, About to Turn 99, Sounds as Good as Ever (October 12, 2009).

In later years, the many baseball honors bestowed on him overshadowed his work in other sports. Phil Rizzuto once asked him to name the greatest Yankee Stadium game he had ever announced, probably expecting to hear a good baseball story. \\"The day Pat Summerall kicked the field goal in the snow in 1958\\", Sheppard replied, referring to the legendary December 14 Giants victory over Cleveland.Yankee Players a No-Show at Sheppard's Funeral (July 16, 2010). nydailynews.com Retrieved July 17, 2010. Retirement Sheppard retired from his position with the Giants, a 50-year handshake agreement with Giants owner Wellington Mara, at the end of the 2005 season, when the commute from his home on Long Island to East Rutherford, New Jersey became too strenuous. His final game was the Giants' playoff loss to the Carolina Panthers on January 8, 2006. He was succeeded by his long-time understudy, former debate student, and colleague in the Speech Department at St. John's University, Jim Hall. Sheppard's microphone in the Baseball Hall of Fame At age 95, health issues began to take their toll: In 2006, Sheppard missed his first Yankees home opener since 1951 after injuring his hip. He was back in time for the next homestand, but it marked the beginning of a slow but inexorable deterioration of his health over the next two seasons. He called what turned out to be his final game, a 10‚Äì2 win over Seattle, on September 5, 2007. The following week, he was hospitalized with a bronchial infection, forcing him to miss the final homestand and the AL Division Series against Cleveland, thus ending his streak of 121 consecutive postseason games at Yankee Stadium. Although he signed a new two-year contract with the Yankees in March 2008, and he particularly looked forward to announcing the 2008 All-Star Game, which was played at Yankee Stadium, he missed the entire 2008 season. He also reluctantly admitted that he lacked sufficient strength to call the final game at the original ballpark on September 21, 2008. \\"I don't have my best stuff\\", he said.

Here, demons tempt the dying man with crowns (a medieval allegory to earthly pride) under the disapproving gaze of Mary, Christ and God. Woodblock seven (4a) of eleven, Netherlands, circa 1460. The Ars moriendi (\\"The Art of Dying\\") are two related Latin texts dating from about 1415 and 1450 which offer advice on the protocols and procedures of a good death, explaining how to \\"die well\\" according to Christian precepts of the late Middle Ages. It was written within the historical context of the effects of the macabre horrors of the Black Death 60 years earlier and consequent social upheavals of the 15th century. The earliest versions were most likely composed in southern Germany. It was very popular, translated into most West European languages, and was the first in a western literary tradition of guides to death and dying. About 50,000 copies were printed in the incunabula period before 1501 and further editions were printed after 1501. Its popularity reduced as Erasmus's treatise on preparing for death (de praeparatione ad mortem, 1533) became more popular. There was originally a \\"long version\\" and a later \\"short version\\" containing eleven woodcut pictures as instructive images which could be easily explained and memorized. These woodcut images were circulated in both print and individual engravings. They could then easily be pinned to a wall for viewing. The authors of the two texts are unknown, but assumed to be Dominican churchmen, as they echo Jean de Gerson's publication, the Opusculum Tripartitu, containing a section named De arte Moriendi. Gerson may have been influenced by earlier references in 'compendia of faith' dating back to the thirteenth century, but the content was uniquely his own.  Long version  The original \\"long version\\", called Tractatus (or Speculum) artis bene moriendi, was composed in 1415 by an anonymous Dominican friar, probably at the request of the Council of Constance (1414‚Äì1418, Germany).N.F. Blake (1982). \\"Ars Moriendi\\". Dictionary of the Middle Ages. v.1, pp547-8. This was widely read and translated into most West European languages, and was very popular in England, where a tradition of consolatory death literature survived until the 17th century. Works in the English tradition include The Way of Dying Well and The Sick Mannes Salve. In 1650, Holy Living and Holy Dying became the \\"artistic climax\\" of the tradition that had begun with Ars moriendi.Nancy Beaty (1970). The Craft of Dying: A Study of the Literary Traditions of the Ars Moriendi in England. Ars Moriendi was also among the first books printed with movable type and was widely circulated in nearly 100 editions before 1500, in particular in Germany. The long version survives in about 300 manuscript versions, only one illustrated. Ars moriendi consists of six chapters: # The first chapter explains that dying has a good side, and serves to console the dying man that death is not something to be afraid of. # The second chapter outlines the five temptations that beset a dying man, and how to avoid them. These are lack of faith, despair, impatience, spiritual pride and avarice. # The third chapter lists the seven questions to ask a dying man, along with consolation available to him through the redemptive powers of Christ's love. # The fourth chapter expresses the need to imitate Christ's life. # The fifth chapter addresses the friends and family, outlining the general rules of behavior at the deathbed. # The sixth chapter includes appropriate prayers to be said for a dying man.  Short version  The \\"short version\\", whose appearance shortly precedes the introduction in the 1460s of block books (books printed from carved blocks of wood, both text and images on the same block), first dates to around 1450, from the Netherlands. It is mostly an adaptation of the second chapter of the \\"long version\\", and contains eleven woodcut pictures. The first ten woodcuts are divided into 5 pairs, with each set showing a picture of the devil presenting one of the 5 temptations, and the second picture showing the proper remedy for that temptation. The last woodcut shows the dying man, presumably having successfully navigated the maze of temptations, being accepted into heaven, and the devils going back to hell in confusion. The \\"short version\\" was as popular as the \\"long version\\", but there was no English translation, perhaps because educated English people at the time were expected to understand several European languages. There are six extant manuscripts of the short version, most not illustrated, and over twenty extant blockbook illustrated editions, using 13 different sets of blocks.A Hyatt Mayor (1971), Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, numbers 23-25. Temptation of lack of Faith; engraving by Master E. S., circa 1450  The images  As well as the eleven different sets of blockbook woodcuts, there is a set by Master E. S. in engraving. The lengthy controversy over their respective dating and priority is now resolved by the discovery by Fritz Saxl of an earlier illuminated manuscript, of well before 1450, from whose tradition all the images in the printed versions clearly derive. Studies of the watermarks of the blockbooks by Allen Stevenson at the British Museum in the 1960s confirmed that none of them predated the 1460s, so Master E. S.' engravings are the earliest printed versions, dating from around 1450. The images remain largely the same in all media for the rest of the century.Alan Shestack (1967). Master E. S., exhibition catalogue, Philadelphia Museum of Art, exhibit numbers 4-15 There is the exceptional number of about seventy incunabulum editions, in a variety of languages, from Catalan to Dutch, the earliest from about 1474 from Cologne. Allegorically the images depicted the contest between angels and demons over the fate of the dying man. In his dying agony his soul emerges from his mouth to be received by one of a band of angels. Common themes portrayed by illustrators include skeletons, the Last Judgement, corpses, and the forces of good and evil battling over souls.Martyn Lyons (2011). Books: A Living History.  Extended tradition  The popularity of the Ars moriendi texts developed into a broader tradition of writing on the good death. Jeremy Taylor's books Holy Living and Holy Dying, published in 1650 and 1651, exemplify that tradition. It developed in both Protestant and Catholic veins and continued in various forms through the nineteenth century.

The child's remains were discovered in 1904, and kept in storage by Museum Victoria for ninety-nine years, until in 2003 they were repatriated to the Dja Dja Wurrung community. The remains were of particular significance because they were found traditionally wrapped in possum skins along with about 130 other artifacts of both European and Aboriginal origin. Discovery The Jaara baby was first discovered by Europeans on 10 September 1904, near the town of Charlton, Victoria, by a woodcutter. He was felling a hollow tree when he discovered the remains wrapped in a possum skin bundle hidden within the tree's trunk. The remains were referred to the Victorian Coroner at the time, who determined that they had been buried in accordance with Aboriginal custom. He suggested that the remains be given to the National Museum of Victoria. Identity Although it had been buried in accordance with Aboriginal custom, there was some doubt as to the identity of the Jaara baby, primarily because it was buried with both Aboriginal and European artifacts. These included Aboriginal necklaces, an apron and a tool belt, along with European items such as a button, an axe head and a baby's bootie. The items were sprinkled with ochre before they were tied up in a bundle of dried possum skins. At one point, Gary Foley, who at the time was the curator of the Bunjilaka exhibition at the Melbourne Museum, was approached by a white man from Canberra who claimed that the Jaara baby was an ancestor of his. He claimed that the baby was actually a European child, who had been abducted by Aboriginal tribesmen during the period of frontier violence which decimated Aboriginal populations in Victoria's west during the mid-nineteenth century. Although tests on the Jaara remains were not conclusive, they did reveal that the child was no more than eighteen months old, whereas the abducted white child was three years old. However, the question of why the baby was buried along with European artifacts is still unanswered. Gary Murray, chairman of the Northwest Region Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Board (and a member of the Dja Dja Wurrung nation), has suggested that the Jaara baby was probably the child of an elder or tribal chief, due to the sheer number and richness of the grave goods. The European items were probably included as a record of the tribe's history at the time, a memorial of conflict with European settlers. Repatriation The baby remained in storage at Museum Victoria until 1994, when researchers from an Aboriginal cultural protection cooperative came across it in the museum catalogue, and were given permission to examine the remains. Later, anthropologist Alan West commenced a study to catalogue all remains in storage at the Museum, including the Jaara baby. In 2002, Gary Murray was negotiating the return of a number of artifacts from the Museum Victoria collection, under the Museum's repatriation program, begun in the 1980s. He was given a list of the Dja Dja Wurrung artifacts that the Museum had in their possession. However, one Museum employee noticed that the Jaara baby was not on the list. Murray approached Gary Foley, who in turn approached the Museum, and, after some dispute, it was agreed that the Jaara baby was to be repatriated. Alan West did not want the bundle to be returned, since he had nearly finished his cataloguing project, and had wanted to separate the remains from the grave goods. This proposal was rejected outright by Murray and other members of the Northwest Region Board. Eventually, West resigned from the Museum in late August 2003. On 10 September 2003, the Jaara baby was finally returned to its home in Dja Dja Wurrung country, and was reburied, ninety-nine years after it was removed. A handover ceremony, which included ceremonial dances by both Dja Dja Wurrung and Wurundjeri people, was conducted by Lord Mayor of Melbourne John So.

A prominent example was Philip Skippon in the English New Model Army as organized by Oliver Cromwell. Over the course of the 17th century, the increasing professionalisation of armies saw sergeant major general become the most junior of the general ranks. At the same time, the sergeant portion of the title was more and more commonly dropped; by the early 18th century, the rank's name had been permanently shortened to major general. Since sergeant major general had ranked below lieutenant general, the newly named rank of major general appeared to create a precedence issue, in that a major outranks a lieutenant but a lieutenant general outranks a major general. This continues to cause confusion to those unfamiliar with the history of the rank, particularly in those armies using insignia similar to the British Army. The rank is sometimes used by paramilitary organizations such as militias. Category:Military ranks ","title":"Sergeant major general"},{"id":"1962164","text":"Colonel commandant is a military title used in the armed forces of some English-speaking countries. The title, not a substantive military rank, could denote a senior colonel with authority over fellow colonels. Today, the holder often has an honorary role outside the executive military structure, such as advocacy for the troops. United Kingdom In the British Army, the term colonel-commandant goes back at least to the American War of Independence, when it denoted an officer in command of a regiment.Letter from the Secretary at War to the Honourable William Gordon, dated 19 December 1777 In 1921, the Army abolished the appointment of brigadier-general and replaced it with the new appointments of colonel-commandant and colonel on the staff:London Gazette, 12 April 1921 Colonels-commandant commanded brigades, depots or training establishments, while colonels on the staff held administrative appointments. Like brigadier-general, both of the new appointments were temporary, the holder reverting to his substantive rank (usually colonel) at the end of his appointment. They were both abolished from 1 June 1928, replaced by the appointment of brigadier (though the rank insignia ‚Äì a crown over three \\"pips\\" or stars ‚Äì remained the same).\\"New Army Rank of Brigadier\\", The Times, 23 December 1927London Gazette, 12 April 1921 The Indian Army used the same appointments. In the Royal Marines, the ranks of colonel commandant and colonel 2nd commandant dated back to 1755, when fifty companies of marines were raised in three divisions: each division had a colonel commandant and a colonel 2nd commandant. These ranked below major-general and above lieutenant- colonel; a colonel 2nd commandant ranked with a Royal Navy captain or an Army colonel, while a colonel commandant ranked with a commodore or a brigadier- general. The Royal Marines adopted the appointment of brigadier-general to be held by its colonels commandant (then five in number) in 1913, and dispensed with it again in 1921. Like the Army, the Royal Marines adopted the appointment of brigadier in 1928, but the ranks of colonel commandant and colonel 2nd commandant persisted at least as far as World War II.Officers' Pay Tables By 1957, however, they had been abolished and replaced with brigadier (now a rank instead of an appointment, as in the Army) and colonel. The title of colonel-commandant is now used as an honorary or ceremonial title relating to a military corps. For example, General Sir Richard Dannatt was Colonel- Commandant of the Army Air Corps as well as his full-time role as Chief of the General Staff and Brigadier Jane Arigho, a retired Director of Army Nursing Services, is the Colonel-Commandant of Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps. Canada The Canadian Armed Forces widely uses colonels commandant as honorary appointments to act as advocates for members and to advise on relevant policy matters. In reserve regiments there has usually been an honorary colonel and an honorary lieutenant-colonel, while in the Regular Force, the title used is colonel commandant or colonel of the regiment. Many units also have a colonel-in-chief who is often a member of the Royal Family, frequently with a name connection to the regiment. Example: The Queen's York Rangers (First American Regiment) having the Queen and later the Duke of York, as Colonel-in-Chief. In the artillery, the monarch holds this role with the appellation \\"Captain-General\\". All of these \\"honoraries\\" are in head-of-family roles, approachable in varying degrees by anyone in the \\"regimental family\\". The colonel commandant of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, is an appointment given by the Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada to a distinguished retired armoured forces officer. The appointment is for three years, during which the incumbent is on the Canadian Forces' reserve list as the senior officer of the corps. He is responsible for advising the army commander on matters pertaining to the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. A colonel commandant travels widely to canvass the views of all ranks in the corps and frequently attends military policy conferences, ceremonies and unit celebrations. He is an ex officio member of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps Association's executive committee. In 2001, the Canadian Forces Medical Branch canvassed past and present members for nominations to the role of colonel commandant. The role is ceremonial but the colonel commandant acts as a link between the Canadian Forces Medical Branch and the wider civilian medical community. The position is not restricted to former senior medical officers; consideration is given to medical practitioners who are \\"particularly prominent and well respected within the world of civilian medicine.\\" Australia Until 1882, William Acland Douglas, who served in the 50th Regiment, was colonel-commandant of the military forces in Victoria. Australian formations, such as the Royal Australian Corps of Military Police and the Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) have Colonel Commandants, a retired soldier whose role is to act as advocate for the troops' interests. This requires visits to wherever the corps or regiment is deployed. Pakistan In the Pakistan Army the post of colonel commandant is an honorary post held by the most senior serving member of a corps or regiments, he is usually a general officer in the rank of Lieutenant General. The post is found is all corps and regiments of the army, e.g. the colonel commandant of Baloch Regiment. Bangladesh In the Bangladesh Army, the post of colonel commandant is an honorary post held by the most senior serving member of a corps or regiment. He is usually a general officer in the rank of lieutenant general or major general. The post is found in all corps and regiments of the army. India In India colonel commandant is a 'non-substantive' post, and is usually held by general officers mostly major generals or lieutenant generals. They are elected through secret ballot. Usually the officer would have been once part of the regiment, and in this role he represents the regiment and its men at the higher level of military hierarchy. This is especially in matters related to troop welfare. In photographs where the officer is portrayed as the 'colonel commandant', the rank insignia of a brigadier affixed on a maroon/vine red background is used. In the National Cadet Corps, which is closely connected to Indian universities the vice chancellor of the university is given the honorary rank of 'colonel commandant'. Vice chancellors are eligible to wear the NCC khakhi uniform and wear the insignia, even though they would not have any military experience. In NCC this appointment is purely ceremonial. Sri Lanka In the Sri Lankan Army the post of colonel commandant is an honorary post held by the most senior serving member of a corps, he/she is usually a general officer or a brigadier. The post is found in all corps of the army as well as the Mechanized Infantry Regiment and the Sri Lanka National Guard. It is similar in function to that of colonel of the regiment found in multi-battalion infantry regiments. United States In 1779, Hungarian-born Colonel Commandant Michael Kovats died leading the Continental Army cavalry against British troops at Charleston. The highest-ranking officer of the United States Marine Corps was formerly titled Colonel Commandant: the title now is simply Commandant. Colonel-Commandant was also used for Lloyd J. Beall, the commanding officer of the short-lived Confederate States Marine Corps during the American Civil War. At the Alamo, William B. Travis was given the position of lieutenant colonel commandant.

Acrotomophiles may enjoy the idea of dominating the amputee during couples play and they may also become aroused with the thought of having to take care of an amputee.

A realistic playwright, along with Aleksandr Ostrovsky he was responsible for the first dramatization of ordinary people in the history of Russian theatre.Banham (1998, 861). \\"Pisemsky's great narrative gift and exceptionally strong grip on reality make him one of the best Russian novelists,\\" according to D.S. Mirsky.D.S. Mirsky, A History of Russian Literature from Its Beginnings to 1900 (Northwestern University Press, 1999: ), p. 211. Pisemsky's first novel Boyarschina (1847, published 1858) was originally forbidden for its unflattering description of the Russian nobility. His principal novels are The Simpleton (1850), One Thousand Souls (1858), which is considered his best work of the kind, and Troubled Seas, which gives a picture of the excited state of Russian society around the year 1862. He also wrote plays, including A Bitter Fate (also translated as \\"A Hard Lot\\"), which depicts the dark side of the Russian peasantry. The play has been called the first Russian realistic tragedy; it won the Uvarov Prize of the Russian Academy. Biography =Early life= Aleksey Pisemsky was born at his father's Ramenye estate in the Chukhloma province of Kostroma. His parents were retired colonel Feofilakt Gavrilovich Pisemsky and his wife Yevdokiya Shipova. In his autobiography, Pisemsky described his family as belonging to the ancient Russian nobility, although his more immediate progenitors were all very poor and unable to read or write: Aleksey remained the only child in the family, four infants dying before his birth and five after. Years later he described himself (to which other people attested) as a weak, capricious and whimsical boy who for some reason loved to mock clergymen and suffered from sleepwalking at one time. Pisemsky remembered his father as a military service man in every sense of the word, strict and duty-bound, a man of honesty in terms of money, severe and strict. \\"Some of our serfs were horrified by him, not all of them, though, only those who were foolish and lazy; those who were smart and industrious were favoured by him,\\" he remarked. Pisemsky remembered his mother a nervous, dreamy, astute, eloquent (even if not well educated) and rather sociable woman. \\"Except for those clever eyes of hers, she wasn't good-looking, and once, when I was a student, my father asked me: 'Tell me Aleksey, why do you think your mother becomes more attractive with age?' ‚Äì 'Because she has a lot of inner beauty which, as years go by, becomes more and more evident', I answered, and he had to agree with me,\\" Pisemsky later wrote. His mother's cousins were Yury Bartenev, one of the most prominent Russian Freemasons (colonel Marfin in the novel Masons) and Vsevolod Bartenev (Esper Ivanovich in People of the Forties), a Navy officer; both exerted considerable influence upon the boy. Pisemsky spent the first ten years of his life in the small regional town of Vetluga where his father served as Mayor. Later he moved with his parents to the countryside. Pisemsky described the years he spent there in Chapter 2 of People of the Forties, an autobiographical novel in which he figured under the name of Pasha. Fond of hunting and horseback riding, the boy received scant education: his tutors were a local deacon, a defrocked drunkard, and a strange old man who was known to have toured the area for decades, giving lessons. Aleksey learned reading, writing, arithmetics, Russian and Latin from them. In his autobiography Pisemsky wrote: \\"Nobody had ever forced me to learn, and I wasn't an avid learner, but I read a lot and that was my passion: by 14 I consumed, in translation, of course, most of Walter Scott's novels, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, Faublas, Le Diable boiteux, The Serapion Brethren, a Persian novel called Haggi Baba... As for children's books, I couldn't stand them and, as far as I remember now, considering them very silly.\\" Pisemsky wrote scornfully of his primary education and regretted failing to learn any languages besides Latin. He found in himself, however, a natural predisposition to mathematics, logic and aesthetics. Formal education In 1834, at the age of 14, Alexey's father took him to Kostroma, to enroll him in the local gymnasium. Memories of his school life found their way into the short story \\"The Old Man\\" and the novel Men of the Forties. \\"I started well, was perceptive and hard-working, but gained most of my popularity as an amateur actor,\\" he later remembered. Inspired by The Dnieper Mermaid (an opera by Ferdinand Kauer), performed by a wandering troupe of actors, Pisemsky, along with his roommate, organized a home theater and had great success with his first role, that of Prudius in The Cossack Poet by Prince Alexander Shakhovskoy. This first triumph had a dramatic effect upon the boy who adopted what he called an \\"aesthetic way of life\\", much under the influence of Vsevolod Nikitovich Bartenev, his uncle. Bartenev supplied his nephew with the newest novels and journals and prompted him to begin studying music and playing the piano, which the boy did, according to one of his friends, \\"with the expressiveness yet unheard of\\". It was while in school that Pisemsky started writing. \\"My 5th form teacher of literature credited me with having talent; in the 6th form I wrote a novella called The Circassian Girl, and in the 7th a still longer one entitled The Iron Ring, both worthy of mention, apparently, only as stylistic exercises, dealing as they did with things I was totally ignorant of at the time,\\" Pisemsky remembered. He sent The Iron Ring (a novel telling of his first romantic passion) to several Saint Petersburg journals and met with all-round rejection. Several months later, already a university student, he gave the novel to Stepan Shevyryov. The professor's reaction was negative and he made a point to discourage the young man from writing about things he knew nothing about. In 1840, upon graduation from the gymnasium, Pisemsky joined the Faculty of Mathematics at Moscow State University, having overcome resistance from his father who insisted upon his son enrolling in the Demidov Lyceum, for it was closer to home and his education there would have been free. Pisemsky later regarded his choice of faculty as a very fortunate one, even while admitting he drew little practical value out of university lectures. Attending assorted lectures by professors from other faculties, he became acquainted with Shakespeare, Schiller, Goethe, Corneille, Racine, Rousseau, Voltaire, Hugo and George Sand and started to form an educated view on the history of Russian literature. Contemporaries pointed at Pisemsky's two major influences of the time: Belinsky and Gogol. Besides, as Pisemsky's friend Boris Almazov remembered, Pavel Katenin, the follower of French classicism and Russian translator of Racine and Cornel, whom Pisemsky knew through being a neighbour, exerted some influence upon him as well. According to Almazov, Pisemsky had a considerable dramatic talent, and it was Katenin who helped him to develop it. =Acting= By 1844 Pisemsky was known as a gifted reciter, his repertoire consisting mostly of works by Gogol. According to Almazov, his solo concerts in his flat on Dolgoruky Lane were immensely popular among both students and visiting schoolboys. A real hit was Pisemsky's performance as Podkolyosin in Gogol's Marriage featured by one of Moscow's small private theaters. \\"Those were the times when Podkolyosin was being portrayed by our great comedian Schepkin, the Imperial Theatre star. Some of those who saw Pisemsky's performance were of the opinion that he presented this character better than Schepkin did,\\" wrote Almazov. Having earned a word-of-mouth reputation as a master of recitals, Pisemsky started to get invitations to perform all over Saint Petersburg and its provinces. Pavel Annenkov later remembered: \\"He performed his own works masterfully, and was able to find exceptionally expressive intonations for every character he was bringing to the stage, which gave a strong effect in his dramatic plays. Equally brilliant was Pisemsky's rendering of his collection of anecdotes concerning his earlier life experiences. He had loads of such anecdotes and each contained a more or less complete character type. Many found their way into his books in a revised form.\\" =State official career= Portrait of Pisemsky by Vasily Perov, 1869 After graduating from the University in 1844, Pisemsky joined the Office of State Properties in Kostroma and was soon transferred to the corresponding department in Moscow. In 1846 he retired and spent two years living in Moscow Province. In 1848 he married Ekaterina, Pavel Svinyin's daughter, and returned to the state office, again in Kostroma, as a special envoy for Prince Suvorov, then the Kostroma governor. After a stint as an assessor in the local government (1849‚Äì1853) Pisemsky joined the Ministry of Imperial Lands in Saint Petersburg where he stayed until 1859. In 1866 he joined the Moscow government as a councilor, soon becoming Chief councilor. He finally quit the civil service (as Court Councilor) in 1872. Pisemsky's state official career in the provinces had a profound effect upon him and his major works. Later Boris Almazov made an important observation in a commemorative speech: \\"Most of our writers who describe the lives of Russian state officials and people from governmental spheres have only fleeting experiences of this kind... More often than not they've served only formally, hardly noticing the faces of their chiefs, let alone those of their colleagues. Pisemsky treated working for the State differently. He gave himself to serving the Russian state wholeheartedly and, whatever post he occupied, had one single objective in mind: fighting the dark forces which our government and the best part of our society try to fight...\\" This, according to the speaker, enabled the author not only to fathom the depths of Russian life but to delve down \\"to the very core of the Russian soul.\\" Biographer and critic Alexander Skabichevsky found some similarities in the development of Pisemsky and Saltykov-Schedrin, another author who examined the provincial bureaucracy in the times of \\"total corruption, embezzlement, no laws for landowners, wild atrocities, and a total lack of real state power\\"; times when \\"provincial life was mostly uncultured and lacked even basic morality,\\" and \\"the life of the intelligent classes had the character of one wanton, never ending orgy.\\" Both writers, according to the biographer, \\"have lost all motivation not just for the idealization of Russian life, but also of highlighting its lighter, positive sides\\". Yet, while Saltykov-Schedrin, a forward-looking stalwart of the Saint Petersburg circles, had every opportunity to be imbued with the high ideals which were making their way into Russian cities from Europe, and to make these ideals the foundation to build his outward negativity upon, Pisemsky, once he found himself in the Russian provinces, became disillusioned in whatever ideas he'd gotten at the University, seeing them as idealistic with no roots in Russian reality, Skabichevsky noted. The biographer wrote: =Literary career= Pisemsky's early works exhibited profound disbelief in the higher qualities of humanity, and a disdain for the opposite sex. Reflecting upon possible reasons for this, Skabichevsky pointed at those first years spent in Kostroma when the young Pisemsky had lost sight of whatever lofty ideals he might have been exposed to while studying in the capital. \\"With my [stage] success as Podkolesin my scientific and aesthetic life ended. What lie ahead was only grief and the need to find work. My father was dead already, my mother, shocked by his death, was paralyzed and lost her speech, my means were meagre. With this in mind I returned to the country and gave myself to melancholy and hypochondria,\\" Pisemsky wrote in his autobiography. On the other hand, it was his continuous official errand trips throughout the Kostroma governorate that provided Pisemsky with the priceless material he used in his future literary work. His first novella Is She to Blame? Pisemsky wrote while still a university student. He gave it to professor Stepan Shevyryov and the latter, being an opponent of the \\"natural school\\", recommended to the author \\"to soften up everything and make it more gentlemanly.\\" Pisemsky agreed to do so, but didn't hurry to follow this advice. What he did instead was send the professor Nina, a naive story about a fresh-looking, beautiful girl who turns into a dull matron. Shevyryov made some editorial cuts and then published the story in the July 1848 issue of the Syn Otechestva magazine. So curtailed and disfigured was this version, that the author never even thought of re-issuing it. The story made its way into the posthumous Wolf's Publishing House 1884 collection of Pisemsky's works (Volume 4). Even in this curtailed form it bore, according to Skabichevsky, every mark of misanthropy and pessimism, seeds of which were sown in Boyarschina. Pisemsky's first novel Boyarschina was written in 1845. Sent to Otechestvennye Zapiski in 1847, it was banned by the censors ‚Äì allegedly for \\"promoting the idea of 'George Sandean' [free] love.\\" When finally published in 1858, the novel failed to make any impact. Still, according to biographer A. Gornfeld, it featured all the elements of Pisemsky's style: expressive naturalism, vitality, many comical details, the lack of positivity and powerful language. Moskvityanin Portrait of Pisemsky by Sergei Levitsky, 1856. In the early 1840s the Russian Slavophile movement divided into two branches. The old school followers led by the brothers Aksakov, Ivan Kireyevsky and Aleksey Khomyakov, grouped first around Moskovsky Sbornik, then Russkaya Beseda. Mikhail Pogodin's Moskvityanin became the center of the younger Slavophiles who were later labeled potchvenniky ('the soil-bound'), Apollon Grigoriev, Boris Almazov, and Alexander Ostrovsky among them. In 1850 Moskvityanin invited Pisemsky to join in and the latter promptly sent Ostrovsky his second novel The Simpleton he'd been working on throughout 1848. In November of that year the story of a young idealist who dies after his illusions have been destroyed, was published in Moskvityanin, to a critical and public acclaim. A year later Marriage of Passion (–ë—Ä–∞–∫ –ø–æ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏) appeared in the same magazine, again praised by the reviewers. Now raised to the ranks of \\"the best writers of our times\\", Pisemsky found his works compared to those of Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov and Alexander Ostrovsky. Pavel Annenkov remembered: Pisemsky's debut play The Hypochondriac (1852) was followed by the Sketches of Peasant life, a three-part short stories cycle. In Pisemsky's second play, The Divide (–†–∞–∑–¥–µ–ª, 1853), a typical natural school piece, parallels have been found with Turgenev's comedy Breakfast at the Chief's. Speaking about Pisemsky's early works, Skabichevsky wrote: \\"Dig deeper into the pessimism which has gone into full swing in The Muff and Marriage by Passion, put it next to the mindset of an ordinary provincial man for examination and you'll be struck by the identical nature of the two. At the bottom of this outlook lies the conviction that man deep in his soul is a scoundrel, moved only by practical interests and egotistical, mostly dirty impulses, and for this reason one has to be on one's guard with one's neighbour and always keep 'a stone by one's bosom'.\\" Influenced for many years by this provincial philosophy, Pisemsky to a large extent made it his own, according to the biographer. \\"Long before Troubled Seas, people of high education, embracing progressive ideas and a new outlook were being shown invariably as outrageous, vulgar rogues, worse than even the ugliest freaks of the uneducated community,\\" Skabichevsky argued. According to Annenkov, some of the 'thinking men of the time' simply refused to put up with this peculiar kind of \\"delight, drawn from the naked comic nature of situations,\\" seeing this as akin to \\"the rapture a street mob enjoys when shown a hunch-backed Petrushka or other physical deformities.\\" Annenkov quoted Vasily Botkin, a \\"terse and far-seeing critic\\" as saying that he \\"could not sympathize with the author who, although unquestionably gifted, apparently has neither principles of his own nor ideas to base his stories upon.\\" Sovremennik Pisemsky in 1860s Encouraged by his early success, Pisemsky became very active and in 1850‚Äì1854 several of his novels, novellas, comedies, and sketches appeared in different journals, among them The Comic Actor, The Petersburg Man and Mr. Batmanov. In 1854 Pisemsky decided to leave his post as a local government assessor in Kostroma and moved to Saint Petersburg where he made quite an impression upon the literary community with his provincial originality, but also some ideas which the Russian capital's cultural elite found shocking. He had no time for the idea of women's emancipation and confessed to experiencing a \\"kind of organic revolt\\" towards all foreigners which he couldn't overcome by any means.\\" The notion of human development in general was totally foreign to him, according to Skabichevsky. Some saw all this as affectation, but, the biographer wrote, \\"dig deeper into the well of Pisemsky's most outrageous opinions and ideas and you'll discover bits and pieces of our ancient, now almost extinct culture, only fragments of which remain in our people.' His very appearance made one think of \\"an ancient Russian peasant man who'd come through the University, learnt something about the civilization but still retained in himself most of the characteristics he had before,\\" the biographer noted. Being regarded by the St. Petersburg literary society a \\"coarse peasant with few social graces and a provincial accent\\" didn't prevent Pisemsky from achieving a solid career in literature, and by the end of the 1850s his reputation was at its peak. In Saint Petersburg Pisemsky made friends with Ivan Panaev, one of the editors of Sovremennik, and sent him his novel The Rich Fianc√©, written in 1851 and satirizing characters like Rudin and Pechorin. Skabichevsky thought it was ridiculous the way the magazine which pretended to be the guiding light of the Russian intelligentsia had fallen for the Rich Fianc√© where this very same intelligentsia (in the Shamilov character) was dragged through the mud. For Pisemsky, the alliance with Sovremennik felt natural, for he was indifferent towards all political parties and the Slavophile movement appealed to him as little as the ideas of the Westernizers. Annenkov wrote: From 1853 Pisemsky's life started to change. Despite his popularity he, according to Annenkov, \\"was still a literary proletarian who had to count money. His house was kept in perfect order by his wife but the simplicity of it showed that the economy was forced. To improve his situation he resumed working as a governmental clerk but soon stopped.\\" Pisemsky started to write less. 1854 saw the publication of Fanfaron in Sovremennik, and a patriotic drama The Veteran and the Newcomer in Otechestvennye Zapiski. In 1855, the latter published \\"Carpenters' Cartel\\" and Is She To Blame?. Both enjoyed success and in his 1855 end of the year review Nikolai Chernyshevsky picked the latter as his book of the year. All of this still failed to translate into financial stability and the author openly criticized editors and publishers for exploiting their employees. He remained relatively poor up until 1861 when the publisher and entrepreneur Fyodor Stellovsky bought the rights to all of his works for 8 thousand rubles. In 1856 Pisemsky, along with several other writers, was commissioned by the Russian Navy ministry to report on the ethnographical and commercial conditions of the Russian interior, his particular field of inquiry being Astrakhan and the region of the Caspian Sea. Critics later opined that the author hadn't been prepared for such a task and what little material he produced was \\"insufferably dull and filled not with his own impressions but with fragments of other works concerning the lands he visited\\" (Skabichevsky). Four of his stories appeared in 1857 in Morskoi Sbornik, and Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya published three more in 1857‚Äì1860. Later they were all gathered in a book called Traveller's Sketches (–ü—É—Ç–µ–≤—ã–µ –æ—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏). 1857 saw just one short story, \\"The Old Lady\\", which appeared in Biblioteka Dlya Chtenia, but by this time he was working on his novel One Thousand Souls. Pisemsky's short stories of the late 1850s and early 1860s, which dealt primarily with rural life (\\"The Carpenters' Cartel\\", \\"Leshy\\", \\"The Old Man\\") again demonstrated the author's utter pessimism and skepticism towards all the most fashionable ideas of his time. Neither idealizing the Russian peasantry, nor mourning its faults (both tendencies were common in Russian literature of the time), the author was critical of the Emancipation reform of 1861 which gave freedom to serfs. \\"Pisemsky thought that without strong moral authority in the lead, the Russians wouldn't be able to get rid of the vices they'd acquired through centuries of slavery and state oppression; that they'd easily adapt to the new institutions and that the worst side of their national character would flourish with still greater fervency. His own life experience led him to believe that the well-being would father more vice than the misery that had initially been at the root of it,\\" Annenkov wrote. According to Skabichevsky, in Pisemky's peasant stories, showing as they do a deep knowledge of common rural life, the protest against oppression was conspicuously absent which made them look as impassively objective as √âmile Zola's novel La Terre. \\"Pisemsky's peasants, like those of Zola, are wild men driven by basic animal instincts; as all primitive men do, they combine high spiritual aspirations with beastly cruelty, often veering between these two extremes with ease,\\" the biographer argued. Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya 200px In the mid-1850s Pisemsky's relationship with Sovremennik started to deteriorate. On the one hand, he was uninterested in the magazine's social stance; on the other, Sovremennik, although greatly respecting his talent and always ready to publish any strong piece of Pisemsky's work that came their way, were keeping their distance. One exception was Alexander Druzhinin, described as a man of \\"eclectic views, a snobbish Anglophile and a follower of the 'art for art's sake' doctrine\\" who was on friendly terms with the 'soil-bound' Moskvityanin. To Sovremennik this was unacceptable. After the Crimean War the new Sovremennik radicals' clique removed Druzhinin from the magazine staff and he moved to Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya. Upset by this, Pisemsky sent his novel One Thousand Souls (the title refers to the number of serfs a landowner had to have in order to be considered wealthy) to Otechestvennye Zapiski where it was published in 1858. In his previous works the author had dealt with local aspects of provincial life; he now endeavoured upon creating a full and damning picture of it \\"highlighting atrocities which were common at the time.\\" \\"The history of governor Kalinovich was no worse than Saltykov-Schedrin's Provincial Sketches and easily as important,\\" Skabichevsky said. The figure of Kalinovich, a man full of contradictions and conflicts, caused much controversy. Nikolay Dobrolyubov barely mentioned Pisemsky's novel in Sovremennik, alleging only that \\"the social side of the novel was artificially sewn to a made-up idea.\\" As editor of Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya, which was in decline, Druzhinin (now terminally ill with consumption) invited Pisemsky to be co-editor. From 1858‚Äì1864 the latter was the actual leader of the magazine. The 1859 play A Bitter Fate marked another peak moment in Pisemsky's career. It was based on a real-life story which the author encountered when, as a Governor's special envoy in Kostroma, he took part in investigating a similar case. Until the emergence of Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness it remained the only drama about Russian peasant life staged in Russia. A Bitter Fate was awarded the Uvarov Prize, was staged at Alexandrinsky Theatre in 1863, and later gained the reputation of a classic of 19th century Russian drama. In 1861 his short novel An Old Man's Sin was published, arguably \\"one of his gentlest and most emotional works, full of sympathy for the lead character.\\" In the mid-1850s Pisemsky was widely praised as one of the leading authors of the time, alongside Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky who as late as 1864, in one of his letters, referred to \\"the colossal name that is Pisemsky.\\"Dostoyevsky, Fyodor. The Complete Collected Works. Letters: V 30 T.- L., 1985.- Vol.28. Part II. P.102. Then came his dramatic fall from grace, for which there were several reasons. One was that, as Skabichevsky noted, Pisemsky had never repudiated his 'troglodyte' mindset of a 'provincial obscurantist'; exotic in the early 1850s, it became scandalous at the end of the decade. Another had to do with the fact that people he regarded as \\"crooks, whores and demagogues\\" had suddenly reinvented themselves as the \\"progressives\\". Gradually Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya, the journal he was now leading, came into a direct opposition with Sovremennik. First, as Pyotr Boborykin remembered, this opposition was of a moderate character, \\"at home, in his cabinet, Pisemsky spoke about this with sorrow and regret, rather than aggression\\". Later biographers conceded that there had been some logic to his chagrin. \\"People who came to herald such radical principles, in his eyes, should have been impeccable in every respect, which wasn't the case,\\" Skabichevsky remarked. Following the common trend, Biblioteka started its own section for humorous sketches and feuilletons, and in 1861 Pisemsky debuted there ‚Äì first as \\"State councilor Salatushka\\", then as Nikita Bezrylov. The latter's first feuilleton, published in the December issue and making fun of liberal trends and views, made quite a stir. In May 1862 Iskra magazine came up with a scathing retort, calling the unknown author 'dumb and ignorant', 'having by nature a very limited mind' and accusing the editor of Biblioteka of providing space for 'reactionaries'. Pisemsky, in a rather reserved way, blamed Iskra for trying to \\"soil his honest name\\", but then Nikita Bezrylov came up with a reply of his own which was quite a match for the Iskra article in terms of outright rudeness. Iskra editors Viktor Kurochkin and N.A. Stepanov went so far as to challenge Pisemsky to a duel, but the latter refused. The Russky Mir newspaper defended Pisemsky and published a letter of protest, signed by 30 authors. This, in its own turn, provoked Sovremennik to come up with a letter denouncing Pisemsky and signed, among others, by its leaders Nikolay Nekrasov, Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Ivan Panaev. Move to Moscow The scandal had a devastating effect upon Pisemsky, who \\"has fallen into a state of total apathy, as he used to do in difficult times,\\" according to Lev Anninsky. Retired from his position at Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya, he severed all ties with literary Saint Petersburg and at the end of 1862 moved to Moscow, where he spent the rest of his life. Pisemsky worked in a hectic manner, devoting the whole of 1862 to Troubled Seas. Of this book's background Pyotr Boborykin wrote: \\"A journey abroad, to the London exhibition, meeting Russian √©migr√©s there, and hearing many curious stories and anecdotes concerning the propagandists of those times confirmed Pisemsky in his decision to paint a broader picture of Russian society, and I don't doubt the sincerity with which he embarked upon this task.\\" Indeed, in April 1862 Pisemsky went abroad and in June visited Alexander Herzen in London so as to explain his position towards the revolutionary democratic press. He failed to get any support, though. The first two parts of it, Boborykin opined, might as well have been published by Sovremennik; in fact, the latter's envoys visited Pisemsky, with this in mind. \\"These two parts I've heard recited by the author himself and by them nobody could have guessed that the novel would turn out to be so unpleasant for the younger generation,\\" Boborykin wrote. Skabichevsky doubted the chronology, though, reminding that in the end of 1862 Pisemsky was already in Moscow. According to his theory, the novel's first two parts might have been ready by the late 1861 when, despite strained relations between the journal and the author the latter still wasn't known as 'an irreconcilable reactionary', the label it given him in early 1862. The second part, written after the break, was extraordinarily vicious in tone. In general, the novel showed Russian society in the most miserable light, as a \\"sea of grief\\", harbouring beneath the surface \\"vile monsters and anemic fishes amongst stinking sea-weed.\\" The novel, where the ugliest characters turned out to be political radicals, naturally received negative reviews, not only in the democratic press (Maxim Antonovich in Sovremennik, Varfolomey Zaitsev in Russkoye Slovo) but also in the centrist magazines like Otechestvennye Zapiski which denounced Troubled Seas as a rude caricature of the new generation. =Later life= 180px After moving to Moscow, Pisemsky joined The Russian Messenger as the head of the literary department. In 1866, on the recommendation of Interior minister Pyotr Valuyev, he became a local government councilor, the job providing him the financial independence he was craving for. Being now a well-paid author and a thrifty man, Pisemsky was able to build his fortune enough to enable him to leave work both at the magazine and the government office. In the late 1860s he bought a small piece of land on Borisoglebsky Lane in Moscow and built himself a house there. All seemed well, but only on the face of it. Troubled Seas (1863) and Russian Liars (1864) were his last critically acclaimed works. Then came the political drama The Warriors and Those Who Wait (1864) and the dramatic dilogy Old Birds (1864), and Birds of the Latest Gathering (1865), followed by the tragedy Men Above the Law, as well as two historical plays, full of melodramatic turns and naturalistic elements, Lieutenant Gladkov and Miloslavskys and Naryshkins (both 1867). In 1869 Zarya published his semi-autobiographical novel People of the Forties. Its main character Vikhrov who the author associated himself with, has been found seriously wanting by critics. In 1871 Beseda published his novel In the Vortex, driven by the same leitmotif: the new 'high ideals' had nothing in common with Russian practical life and were therefore worthless. According to Skabichevsky, all the post-1864 works of Pisemsky were much weaker than everything he'd written before, demonstrating \\"the decline of a talent so dramatic it was unprecedented in Russian literature.\\" Then followed a series of pamphlet-type dramas (Baal, The Enlightened Times, and The Financial Genius) in which Pisemsky took it upon himself to fight the \\"blight of the time\\", all manner of financial misdoings. \\"In the earlier years I exposed stupidity, prejudices and ignorance, ridiculed childish romanticism and empty rhetoric, fought serfdom and denounced abuses of power, documented the emergence of the first flowers of our nihilism, which has now had their fruits, and finally have taken on human kind's worst enemy, Baal, the golden calf of worship... I've also brought light to things for everybody to see: the wrong-doings of entrepreneurs and purveyors are colossal, all trade [in Russia] is based upon the most vile deceit, theft in banks is business as usual and beyond all this scum, like angels, our military men stand shining,\\" he explained in a private letter. One of his comedies, Saps (–ü–æ–¥–∫–æ–ø—ã), was so outright in its critique of higher spheres it was banned by censors. Others were staged, but enjoyed only short-lived success, having to do mostly with the sensationalist aspect, for the public could recognize in certain characters real life officials and financiers. Artistically they were flawed, and even The Russian Messenger, which traditionally had supported the author, refused to publish The Financial Genius. After the stage production of the play flopped, Pisemsky returned to the form of the novel and in his last 4 years produced two of them: The Philistines, and Masons, the later being notable for its picturesque historical background created with the help of Vladimir Solovyov. Skabichevsky described both as \\"anemic and dull\\", and even Ivan Turgenev, who made great efforts to cheer Pisemsky up, still noted a streak of \\"tiredness\\" in the author's latest prose. \\"You were absolutely right: I am really tired of writing, and even more ‚Äì of living. Of course old age is no fun for anybody, but for me it's especially bad and full of dark torment I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy,\\" Pisemsky wrote back in a letter. Losing popularity was one of the reasons for such misery. He scolded his critics, calling them \\"vipers\\", but was aware that his golden days were over. Vasily Avseenko, describing Pisemsky's visit to Saint Petersburg in 1869 after the publication of People of the Forties, recalled how old and tired he looked. \\"I am beginning to feel like a victim of my own spleen,\\" Pisemsky confessed in an August 1875 letter to Annenkov. \\"I am all right physically, but cannot say the same of my mental and moral state; hypochondria torments me. I am unable to write and any mental effort makes me feel sick. Thank God the religious feeling, which is now blossoming in me, gives some respite to my suffering soul,\\" Pisemsky wrote to Turgenev in the early 1870s. In these difficult times the one person who continuously provided moral support to Pisemsky was Ivan Turgenev. In 1869 he informed Pisemsky that his One Thousand Souls had been translated into German and enjoyed \\"great success in Berlin\\". \\"So now the time has come for you to step outside the borders of your motherland and for Aleksey Pisemsky to become a European name,\\" Turgenev wrote on October 9, 1869. \\"The best Berlin critic, Frenzel, in National Zeitung devoted a whole article to you where he calls your novel 'a rare phenomenon', and I tell you, now you are well known in Germany,\\" wrote Turgenev in another letter, enclosing clips from other papers, too. \\"The success of One Thousand Souls encourages [the translator] to start upon the novel Troubled Seas and I am so happy both for you and for Russian literature in general‚Ä¶ Critical reviews of One Thousand Souls here in Germany are most favourable, your characters are being compared to those of Dickens, Thackeray, etc, etc\\", he continued. Julian Schmidt‚Äôs large article in Zeitgenossensche Bilder, part of the series devoted to first class European authors, provided for Pisemsky another cause to celebrate, and following Turgenev's advice, in 1875 he visited Schmidt to thank him personally. Another joyful event of these final years of Pisemsky's life was the commemoration on January 19, 1875, of the 25th anniversary of his literary career. One of the speakers, the Beseda editor Sergey Yuryev, said: The tombs of Aleksey Pisemsky and his wife at the Novodevichy Convent \\"My 25 years in literature have not been easy. While fully aware of how weak and inadequate my efforts have been, I still feel like I've every reason to continue: I never came under somebody else's flag, and my writing, good or bad, it's not for me to judge, contained only what I myself felt and thought. I remained true to my own understanding of things, never violating for any fleeting reason the modest talent nature gave me. One of my guiding lights has always been my desire to tell my country the truth about itself. Whether or not I succeeded, is not for me to tell,\\" Pisemsky said in reply. In the late 1870s Pisemsky's beloved younger son Nikolai, a talented mathematician, committed suicide for reasons which were unexplained. This was a heavy blow for his father who sunk into a deep depression. In 1880 his second son Pavel, the Moscow University Law faculty docent, became fatally ill, and this finished Pisemsky off. As Annenkov remembered, he \\"became bed- ridden, crushed by the weight of fits of pessimism and hypochondria which became more frequent after his family's catastrophe. His widow said later she never suspected that the end was near and thought the bout would pass, dissolving as it used to into physical weakness and melancholy. But this one proved to be the last for the tormented Pisemsky, who lost all willingness to resist.\\" On January 21, 1881, Pisemsky died, only a week before the death of Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Whereas the latter's funeral in Saint Petersburg became a grandiose event, Pisemsky's burial went unnoticed. Of well-known authors only Alexander Ostrovsky was present. In 1885 the Wolf Publishing House issued an edition of the Complete Pisemsky in 24 volumes. Pisemsky's personal archive was destroyed by fire. His house was later demolished. Borisoglebsky Lane, where he spent his last years, was renamed Pisemsky Street in the Soviet times. Private life Pisemsky's first romantic affairs, according to his autobiography, concerned various cousins. After the University, he developed an interest in what he termed \\"George Sandean free love\\" but soon became disillusioned and decided to marry, \\"selecting for this purpose a girl not of a coquettish type, coming from a good, even if not wealthy family,\\" namely Yekaterina Pavlovna Svinyina, daughter of Pavel Svinyin, the founder of Otechestvennye Zapiski magazine. They married on October 11, 1848. \\"My wife is portrayed partially in Troubled Seas, as Evpraxia, who's also nicknamed Ledeshka (Piece of Ice),\\" he wrote. This was a practical marriage without any romantic passion involved, yet a fortunate one for Pisemsky, for, according to many people who knew her, Svinyina was a woman of rare virtues. \\"This exceptional woman proved able to calm down his sick hypochondria, and free him not only from all the domestic obligations involved in bringing up children, but also from her own meddling into his private affairs, which were full of whims and rush impulses. Besides, she re-wrote by her own hand no less than two thirds of his original manuscripts which invariably looked like crooked, indecipherable scribbling furnished with ink-blots,\\" wrote Pavel Annenkov. Biographer Semyon Vengerov quoted a source who knew Pisemsky closely as having called Yekaterina Pavlovna \\"a perfect literary wife who took very close to her heart all the literary anxieties and troubles of her husband, all the jigsaws of his creative career, cherishing his talent and doing whatever was possible to keep him in conditions favourable to the development of his talent. Add to all this a rare leniency, of which she had to have a great deal of, to put up with Aleksey, who occasionally demonstrated qualities not congenial with being a family man.\\" Ivan Turgenev, in one of his letters, imploring Pisemsky to get rid of this spleen of his, wrote: \\"I think I've told you this once, but I might as well repeat it. Do not forget that in the lottery of life you've won a major prize: you have an excellent wife and nice children...\\" =Personality= According to Lev Anninsky, Pisemsky's personal mythology \\"revolved around one word: fear.\\" Biographers reproduced numerous anecdotes about him being scared of sailing and other things, and how he was often 'stuck on the front porch of his house, uncertain whether he should enter: thinking that robbers were there, or somebody had died, or a fire had started'. Quite striking were his extraordinary collection of phobias and fears, along with general hypochondria.\\" In an 1880 letter to photographer Konstantin Shapiro who had recently published his gallery of Russian writers he confessed: \\"My portrait repeats the one flaw which all of my photographic portraits have, my not knowing how to pose. In all of my photographs my eyes come out goggled and frightened and even somewhat mad, maybe because as they put me facing the camera obscura, I do experience ‚Äì if not fear, then strong anxiety.\\" People who knew Pisemsky personally remembered him warmly, as a man whose weaknesses were outweighed by virtues, of which a keen sense of justice, good humour, honesty, and modesty were the most obvious. According to Arkady Gornfeld, \\"His whole character, from the inability to understand foreign cultures to ingenuousness, humour, keenness of remarks and common sense ‚Äì was that of a simple, if very clever, Russian muzhik. His main personal feature became a major literary asset: truthfulness, sincerity, total lack of the faults of pre-Gogol literature, like over-intensity and eagerness to say something that was beyond the author's understanding,\\" he remarked in his essay on Gogol. Pavel Annenkov wrote of Pisemsky: Legacy 250px Contemporary critics differed greatly in trying to classify Pisemsky's prose or assess his position in Russian literature. In retrospect, this position altered dramatically with the times and, as critic and biographer Lev Anninsky noted, while Melnikov-Pechersky or Nikolai Leskov have always been far from the literary mainstream, Pisemsky spent some time as a 'first rank' author and was praised as an 'heir to Gogol' in the course of the 1850s, then dropped from the elite to slide into almost total oblivion which lasted for decades. According to Anninsky, \\"more daring critics drew a parallel with Gogol... whose final years sort of pre-dated the future drama of Pisemsky: breaking away from the 'progressive Russia', the 'betrayal' and the ostracism that followed. But Russia's forgiven Gogol everything: the pose of an angry prophet, the second volume of Dead Souls, those 'reactionary' passages from The Chosen Fragments of Correspondence with Friends. As for Pisemsky, Russia refused to forgive him a single thing,\\" the critic argued. Having entered the Russian literary scene when it was dominated by the Natural School, Pisemsky has been regarded as arguably its most notable proponent. This wasn't obvious to many of his contemporaries, though; both Pavel Annenkov and Alexander Druzhinin (critics of different camps) argued that Pisemsky's earlier works were not only foreign to the Natural School, but stood in direct opposition to it. Apollon Grigoriev (who in 1852 wrote: \\"The Muff is the... artistic antidote to the sickly rubbish the 'Natural School' authors produce\\") went even further ten years later, stating in Grazhdanin that Pisemsky with his \\"low-brow wholesomeness\\" was far more important to Russian literature than Goncharov (with his \\"affected nods to narrow-minded pragmatism\\"), Turgenev (who \\"surrendered to all false values\\") and even Leo Tolstoy (who had \\"made his way to artlessness in the most artful manner\\"). In the 1850s, concentrating on the everyday life of the small-scale provincial Russian, Pisemsky recreated this world as totally devoid of romantic features. \\"He mercilessly destroyed the poetic aura of 'noblemen‚Äôs nests' that was created by Tolstoy and Turgenev,\\" recreating the life of the community where all relations looked ugly and \\"real love was always losing to cool flirting or open deceit,\\" biographer Viduetskaya wrote. On the other hand, in \\"picturing the Russian muzhik, and being the master of reproducing the language of the lower classes, Pisemsky had no equals; after him a return to the type of peasant novel created by Grigorovich became unthinkable\\", critic A. Gornfeld argued. As D. S. Mirsky put it in his 1926 History of Russian Literature, \\"Like others among the Russian realists, Pisemsky is gloomy rather than otherwise but again in a different way ‚Äì his gloom is nothing like Turgenev's hopeless surrender to the mysterious forces of the universe, but a hearty and virile disgust at the vileness of the majority of mankind and at the futility in particular of the Russian educated classes.\\" The inability of contemporary critics to sum up Pisemsky in a more or less congruous manner, according to Anninsky, might be explained by the fact that the world of Pisemsky (for whom \\"artistic intuition was the instrument of logic\\") was \\"rough and soft, unprepossessing and vulnerable\\", open to all manner of interpretations. The ground that Pisemsky stood on, as Anninsky saw it, was doomed from the start: stronger authors (Tolstoy and Turgenev, in particular) entered the scene, created new, more interesting characters, re-worked this soil and made it their own. According to Viduetskaya, Pisemsky's original driving force was negativism which had been played out by the early 1860s. Seeing as the peak of his post-reform legacy the cycle Russian Liars (1865), the critic considers Pisemsky the novelist a marginal force in Russian literature, admitting, though, that writers like Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak and Alexander Sheller were among his followers. But as a short story writer he might be considered as a predecessor to such masters of the form as Leskov and Chekhov, Viduetskaya suggested. According to D. S.

It is a well-preserved example of a mid-19th century stone lighthouse. The light was taken out of service in 1889 and now serves as a local history museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Stonington Harbor Light is located at the southern end of Stonington Point, marking the eastern side of Stonington Harbor. The light station consists of the tower and keeper's house; both are built out of large granite blocks, and the keeper's house has a wood- framed ell attached. The tower is an octagonal stone structure in height and in diameter, with a circular glass lantern house on top. The house is 1¬Ω stories and about square. The federal government built a lighthouse on Windmill Point in Stonington Harbor in 1824; it was housed in a small granite lighthouse and was known by the same name. However, erosion led to its being torn down and its materials reused in the construction of this lighthouse. The light was originally lit by an oil lamp and broadcast by eight parabolic reflectors. This technology was already obsolete at the time of the lighthouse's construction, and it was replaced by a sixth-order Fresnel lens in 1856. In the 1880s, the Stonington Breakwater Light was constructed farther out in the harbor, and the Stonington Harbor Light was decommissioned in 1889. The site is now the home of the Stonington Historical Society which uses the building as The Old Lighthouse Museum. Holdings in the museum document the area's long and distinguished cultural and nautical history, and exhibits include the 1856 Fresnel lens.

She rose to fame in 1987 after her debut single \\"Tell It to My Heart\\". Dayne achieved six additional U.S. top-10 singles, including \\"Love Will Lead You Back\\", \\"Prove Your Love\\", and \\"I'll Always Love You\\". Dayne has sold over 75 million records worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has earned three Grammy Award nominations, an American Music Award, and multiple New York Music Awards. She has also received New York Hall of Fame honors and was ranked number 18 on Rolling Stone's list of the best female dance artists of all time. In December 2016, Billboard magazine ranked her the 28th most successful dance artist of all time. Singing and acting career =Early success= Leslie Wunderman began singing professionally after graduating from high school in Baldwin, Nassau County, New York, singing in little-known rock bands such as Felony and Next. She began singing solo after finishing college and, under the name Les Lee, recorded two dance singles, \\"I'm The One You Want\\" (1985) and \\"Tell Me Can You Love Me\\" (1986), which were released on New York indie label Mega Bolt. Signed to Arista Records as Taylor Dayne, her first song to crack the top ten was the dance-pop hit \\"Tell It to My Heart\\" in late 1987. The song was an instant smash worldwide, peaking in the top five of most major markets worldwide, and reaching number one in many countries, including West Germany. Six more U.S. top-ten hits followed, including \\"Prove Your Love\\", \\"I'll Always Love You\\", \\"Don't Rush Me\\", \\"With Every Beat of My Heart\\", \\"Love Will Lead You Back\\" and \\"I'll Be Your Shelter\\". These were followed by the No. 12 hit \\"Heart of Stone\\". In the United States, she achieved three gold singles, \\"Tell It to My Heart\\", \\"I'll Always Love You,\\" and \\"Love Will Lead You Back.\\" \\"I'll Always Love You,\\" a change-of-pace ballad compared to Dayne's earlier releases, was her breakout hit on the Adult Contemporary charts in 1988 and paved the way for future uptempo dance tracks such as \\"Don't Rush Me\\" (1988) and \\"With Every Beat Of My Heart\\" (1989) to gain acceptance on Adult Contemporary radio. In 1990, \\"Love Will Lead You Back\\", a Diane Warren composition, peaked at No. 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. The string of hits from her first two albums, Tell It to My Heart (1988) and Can't Fight Fate (1989), proved to be the peak of her career. She went on to release two more albums in the 1990s, but had only one more U.S. Top 40 hit, her 1993 cover of Barry White's 1974 hit \\"Can't Get Enough of Your Love\\" (from her 1993 album Soul Dancing), which reached No. 2 in the ARIA Charts in Australia but only No. 20 in the U.S. Together with Arthur Baker and Fred Zarr, Dayne wrote \\"Whatever You Want\\" for Tina Turner's 1996 album Wildest Dreams. Dayne later recorded and released the song herself in 1998 as a single from her album Naked Without You. That album failed to chart, but Dayne continued to have hits on the dance charts into the 2000s. =Later singing and acting career= As an actress, Dayne appeared in the 1997 sci-fi television series Nightman as Carla Day. She has had roles in independent films such as Fool's Paradise (1997), Stag (also in 1997) and Jesus the Driver (2004), as well as the Warren Beatty-produced 1994 remake of Love Affair. Dayne also had a recurring role on the Showtime series Rude Awakening. Dayne has performed alongside Marc Bonilla and Dragonchoir. She performed on Broadway in Elton John's Aida in 2001. In 2005, Dayne was featured in the VH1 series Remaking, which featured her close friends Leah Remini and Michelle Reid. The series documents Dayne's return to music after taking time off to have a family (she has twins via a surrogate motherTaylor Dayne Shares Her Surrogate Story Celebrity Baby Blog, February 19, 2009), and premiered her newest song, \\"Right Now,\\" a result of her collaboration with Rodney Jerkins. Dayne performing in concert, January 15, 2006 On December 11, 2007, Dayne released the first single, \\"Beautiful\\", from her studio album Satisfied. The song was written by Dayne and Hitesh Ceon of production team 3Elementz. Dayne promoted it on many radio stations, including New York's WKTU. \\"Beautiful\\" went to No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Charts. She also appeared on The Today Show, Chelsea Lately, Wake Up With Whoopi and VH1. The music video for the single and the Satisfied album cover were shot by Tony Duran, who has also shot album covers for Justin Timberlake and Jennifer Lopez. Dayne released her fifth album, Satisfied, in February 2008‚Äîher first recording studio album in nearly a decade. Producers on this record include Rick Nowels, Gregg Alexander and Peter Wade. The album includes both new material and recreations of some of her favorite contemporary songs. In 2008, Dayne performed at the Paralympic Games in Beijing, China. In May 2010, Dayne lobbied congressional leaders on Capitol Hill on behalf of NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) and VH1's Save The Music Foundation to reduce cuts in music education in America's schools. In July 2010, Dayne released \\"Facing a Miracle\\", the official theme song to the 2010 Gay Games. She performed the song to an audience of 50,000 on July 31, 2010, in Cologne, Germany. It ended the year at No. 9 on Perfect Beat's Top Worldwide Singles of 2010. Five years before, however, she had said: \\"In the eyes of the Kaballah, [gays] can't be 'married.' That requires actual male and female energy and DNA. In the bigger picture, I think that 'marriage' is about a certain circuitry. I'm as married to my business manager as I would be any husband.\\" Dayne remastered her Greatest Hits album. She released a new single, \\"Floor on Fire\\", on June 22, 2011, which broke the Billboard Dance/Club Charts Top 10. In 2011-2012 Dayne competed in Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off, reaching the semifinal round in episode 5 facing off against Lou Diamond Phillips for the final spot to represent Team Rachael. At the end of the episode she lost to Joey Fatone of N'Sync in a runner-up challenge to win $5,000 for charity. In the early 2010s, American stand-up comedian Tig Notaro began referencing Dayne in her routine, telling stories of having frequent encounters with her. This was ultimately brought to the attention of Ira Glass, who enlisted Notaro to tell the story as part of a live event for This American Life. Dayne herself appeared at the end of the monologue during the event, singing \\"I'll Always Love You.\\" In September 2014, Dayne released a new single, \\"Dreaming\\". Personal life Dayne has never married. She has three children, two of whom were born via a surrogate. Dayne became a supporter of same-sex marriage (after having been opposed to it) in 2005, and stated in 2014 that she considers the LGBT community to be her most loyal fanbase.

It is home to three sprint canoe and kayak clubs, two rowing clubs, and a dragon boat club. It also has a claim to be the birthplace of ice hockey. Location Lake Banook's eastern shore is bordered by Prince Albert Road (part of Trunk 7) and its western shore fronts Crichton Park, a residential neighbourhood. At the south end of the lake is a lock mechanism leading to Sullivan's Pond. At the north end of the lake a bridge carries the Highway 111 expressway, informally known as the Dartmouth Circumferential Highway over its waters. The bridge also serves as a dividing line between Lake Micmac, also referred to as Second Lake. Birch Cove Beach is the only beach on the lake that is currently supervised. Another beach, Graham's Grove, was closed in the early-1990s, as a result of poor water quality stemming from the construction of the nearby \\"Mic Mac Par-clo\\" (partial clover-leaf), a large interchange connecting Highway 111, Trunk 7, and Route 318, which replaced the rotary previously on the site. Lake Banook has undergone many modifications. It was originally approximately two meters shallower than its current depth, after being dammed during the construction of the Shubenacadie Canal in the early 19th century. When the water rose, it submerged a small island. During improvements for the 1989 Junior World Championships, the top section of the paddling course was dredged to meet depth standards. The fill was used to expand nearby Graham's Grove Park, and the former access road still remains underwater. There have been shoreline modifications for recreational beaches, private waterfront, boat docks, and municipal pipelines. Some natural shoreline remains at the north end of Brookdale Crescent Park, the north end of Birch Cove, and parts of Grahams Grove. History Lake Banook is named for the Mi'kmaq phrase for \\"first lake\\", as it is the first lake in the system that later became the Shubenacadie Canal. The Mi'kmaq people were the first to navigate the waters of Lake Banook, which contributed to the naming of Lake Micmac, Mic Mac Mall, and Mic Mac AAC. Hockey was played on Lake Banook as early as 1827, and certainly by 1850, though the game was then known as both rickets and wicket. Dartmouth is one of several locales around the world that claim the title of \\"Birthplace of Hockey.\\" In 1864 Starr manufacturing of Dartmouth, located less than a kilometer from Lake Banook, began producing the world's first modern iceskates. Starr skates, first used on the lakes of Dartmouth including Lake Banook, later became a popular choice for elite ice hockey players, being worn by 6 out of 7 members of the 1902 Stanley Cup Champions Montreal Hockey Club. The Starr company produced ice skates into the 1930s. In the days before refrigerators, the lake was a source of ice for the residents of both Halifax and Dartmouth. Since 1903, with the formation of the Banook Canoe Club, Lake Banook has been home to many competitive and recreational canoeists, kayakers, and rowers. Dartmouth has more paddlers per capita than anywhere else in Canada. Sport Banook Canoe Club Lake Banook is home to three sprint canoe/kayak clubs, clustered at the south end of the lake: Banook Canoe Club, Senobe Aquatic Club, and Mic Mac Amateur Aquatic Club. This arrangement is unique in Canada, and has led to a longstanding and healthy competitive rivalry between clubs. All three clubs have developed multiple Olympians, National Champions, and World Championship team members. The lake is outfitted with an international-calibre 1000-metre sprint canoe and kayak race course during the summer months. The course spans nine racing lanes of nine metres in width, with the 1000-metre start line at the north end of the lake, and the finish line at the south end. On the western shore, a three-story judges tower is elevated above the lake at the finish line, allowing officials to judge the finishes of races. The course is used for numerous local and national competitions every year. Lake Banook has also hosted many world-class competitions, including the canoe/kayak and rowing events at the inaugural Canada Summer Games in 1969, the World Junior Canoe Sprint Championships in 1989, the Senior World Canoe Sprint Championship in 1997, the World Canoe Marathon Championship in 2001, and the Senior World Sprint Championships in 2009. Lake Banook will play host to the Senior World Sprint Championships for the third time in 2022. No other venue outside of Europe has hosted the Senior World Sprint Championship on more occasions. The lake is also used for local rowing competitions, and hosts both the Mic Mac AAC rowing club and the independent North Star Rowing club. The course is not ideal for national or international competitions in rowing, as its restricted length does not enable 2000-metre races. As dragon boat paddling exploded in popularity, a fifth boat club was founded in the northeast corner of Lake Banook. Dragon Boat East offers year-round training programs for members and other dragon boat services. Lake Banook is the site of Halifax's annual dragon boat competition and festival.

Etymology The term comes from the French rago√ªter, meaning: \\"to revive the taste\\". Preparation The basic method of preparation involves slow cooking over a low heat. The main ingredients are many; ragouts may be prepared with or without meat, a wide variety of vegetables may be incorporated, and they may be more or less heavily spiced and seasoned. Examples Plated turkey rago√ªt Two 18th- century English dishes from The Compleat Housewife show some of the varying meats, vegetables, seasonings, garnishes and procedures which can be applied to the rago√ªt. > A Ragoo for made Dishes > TAKE claret, gravy, sweet-herbs, and savoury spice, toss up in it lamb- > stones (i.e. lamb‚Äôs testicles), cock's-combs, boiled, blanched, and sliced, > with sliced sweet-meats, oysters, mushrooms, truffles, and murrels; thicken > these with brown butter; use it when called for. > To make a Ragoo of Pigs-Ears > TAKE a quantity of pigs-ears, and boil them in one half wine and the other > water; cut them in small pieces, then brown a little butter, and put them > in, and a pretty deal of gravy, two anchovies, an eschalot or two, a little > mustard, and some slices of lemon, some salt and nutmeg: stew all these > together, and shake it up thick. Garnish the dish with barberries. In his 19th century culinary dictionary, Alexander Dumas credits ragouts with making \\"the ancient French cuisine shine\\". He gives several examples including salpicons, made with a variety of meats and vegetables like mushrooms, artichokes, truffles, quenelles, and sweetbreads. According to Dumas each ingredient is cooked separately. The \\"Ordinary Salpicon\\" includes veal sweetbreads, ham, mushrooms, foie gras and truffles served in espagnole sauce. Celery ragout is cooked in bouillon seasoned with salt, nutmeg and pepper. Cucumber ragout is made with velout√© sauce. One ragout is made with madeira, chestnuts and chipolata sausages cooked in bouillon with espagnole sauce.Alexandre Dumas' Dictionary of Cuisine, 1873 Popular culture The 1731 patriotic ballad \\"The Roast Beef of Old England\\" by the British writer Henry Fielding comically attributes Britain's traditional military prowess to the eating of roast beef, suggesting that this has been lost since the introduction of ragout from \\"all-vapouring France\\". In the novel Pride and Prejudice, the character Mr Hurst reacts with disdain when Elizabeth Bennet opts for a \\"plain dish\\" instead of a ragout at dinner.

The film stars Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy, with Omri Katz, Thora Birch, and Vinessa Shaw in supporting roles. The film follows a villainous comedic trio of witches who are inadvertently resurrected by a teenage boy in Salem, Massachusetts, on Halloween night. The film was released in the United States on July 16, 1993, by Walt Disney Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from film critics at the time of its release. It was not a critical or commercial success upon its release, possibly losing Disney around $16.5 million during its theatrical run. However, largely through annual airings on Disney Channel and Freeform (formerly ABC Family), Hocus Pocus has been rediscovered by audiences, resulting in a yearly spike in home video sales of the film every Halloween season that has helped make it a cult classic. A sequel, directed by Adam Shankman, is in development as a Disney+ original film, with a screenplay written by Jen D'Angelo. Plot On October 31, 1693, just outside of Salem, Massachusetts, Thackery Binx sees his little sister, Emily Binx, being taken away to the cottage of three witches. There, the Sanderson sisters, Winifred, Sarah, and Mary, cast a spell on Emily to absorb her youth and regain their own, killing her in the process. Thackery confronts the witches who transform him into an immortal black cat cursed to live forever with his guilt for not saving Emily. The townsfolk, led by Thackery‚Äôs friend, Elijah and his father, capture the witches. But before being hanged, Winifred casts a spell that will resurrect the witches during a full moon on All Hallows' Eve when any virgin lights the Black Flame Candle. Unable to convince his father of his true identity as a cat, Thackery decides to guard the cottage to ensure no one summons the witches. Three hundred years later, on October 31, 1993, on Halloween, Max Dennison is feeling unsettled from his family's sudden move from Los Angeles, California, to Salem, Massachusetts. Max takes his younger sister Dani out for trick-or-treating, where they run into Max's new crush Allison. Allison mentions that her family owns the Sanderson cottage as a museum but it's now closed. Max, in an effort to impress Allison, invites her to show him the Sanderson house to convince him that the witches were real. Investigating inside the cottage, Max lights the Black Flame Candle and inadvertently resurrects the witches, who must continue to suck the souls of every child in Salem to continue living, or else they disintegrate. The witches attempt to suck the soul of Dani, but Max comes to the rescue. Escaping, Max steals Winifred's spellbook on advice from Thackery, who now goes by his last name of Binx. The witches pursue them to a cemetery, where Winifred raises her unfaithful lover Billy Butcherson as a zombie to chase them on foot. The witches try to acclimate to the 20th century, but are horrified when they discover Halloween has become a holiday. They pursue the children across town using Mary's enhanced sense of smell. Max, Dani, and Allison find their parents at the town hall Halloween party, where Winifred enchants the partygoers to dance until they die. At Jacob Bailey High School, the children trap the witches in a kiln to burn them alive. While the children are celebrating, the witches' curse revives them again. Not realizing that the witches haven't truly died, Max and Allison open the spellbook as an effort to reverse the spell on Binx. The open spellbook reveals the location of the group, and the witches track them down and kidnap Dani and Binx, and get the book back. Sarah then uses her siren-like singing to mesmerize Salem's children, luring them to the Sandersons' cottage. Max and Allison rescue Dani and Binx by tricking the witches into believing sunrise came an hour early. Back at the cemetery, the witches attack, and Winifred attempts to use the last vial of potion to suck the soul from Dani. Binx leaps on Winifred and knocks the potion out of her hand. Max drinks the potion, forcing the witches to take him instead of Dani. The sun rises just as Winifred is about to finish draining Max's life force, and due to standing on hallowed ground in the cemetery, she turns to stone before being disintegrated into dust along with her sisters. With the witches gone, Max, Dani, and Allison say goodbye to Billy, as he returns to the grave. Thackery finally dies, freeing his soul. Appearing as a spectral, The thanks the children for their help, and bids farewell to them as he is reunited with the spirit of his little sister Emily. The exhausted partygoers, including Max and Dani's parents, Dave and Jenny are freed the spell is broken, oblivious to their enchantment and return home. Meanwhile, at the Sanderson‚Äôs cottage, Ice and Jay, who previously tormented Max and Dani and were captured by the witches after inadvertently insulting them, remain imprisoned in their cages and sing \\"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\\" to pass the time. Winnie's spellbook is seen opening its eye, revealing it is still alive and the witches could possibly return again.

Production =Development= In the 1994 TV documentary Hocus Pocus: Begin the Magic, and on the film's Blu-ray release, producer David Kirschner said he came up with the idea for the film one night. He and his young daughter were sitting outside and his neighbor's black cat strayed by. Kirschner invented a tale of how the cat was once a boy who was changed into a feline three hundred years ago by three witches. Hocus Pocus started life as a script by Mick Garris, that was bought by Walt Disney Pictures in 1984. The film's working title was Disney's Halloween House, it was much darker and scarier, and its protagonists were all 12-year-olds. Garris and Kirschner pitched it to Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment; Spielberg saw Disney as a competitor to Amblin in the family film market at the time and refused to co-produce a film with his \\"rival.\\" =Writing= Various rewrites were made to the script to make the film more comedic and made two of its young protagonists into teenagers; however, production was stalled several times until 1992, when Bette Midler expressed interest in the script and the project immediately went forward. Midler, who plays the central antagonist of the film (originally written for Cloris Leachman), is quoted as saying that Hocus Pocus \\"was the most fun I'd had in my career up to that point\\". =Casting= Leonardo DiCaprio was originally offered the lead role of Max, but declined it in order to pursue What's Eating Gilbert Grape. =Filming= Principal photography began on October 12, 1992. The film is set in Salem, Massachusetts, but most of it was shot on sound stages in Burbank, California. However, its daytime scenes were filmed in Salem and Marblehead, Massachusetts during two weeks of filming with principal cast. Production was completed on February 10, 1993. Pioneer Village, a recreation of early-colonial Salem, was used for the opening scenes set in 1693. Other locations included Old Burial Hill in Marblehead, where Max is accosted by Ice and Jay, the Old Town Hall in Salem, where the town Halloween party takes place, and Phipps Elementary School, where the witches are trapped in a kiln. The exterior for Max and Dani's house is a private residence on Ocean Avenue in Salem. Release The film was released to VHS in North America on September 9, 1994 and later to DVD on June 4, 2002. Following the film's release on the latter format, it has continued to show strong annual sales, raking in more than $1 million in DVD sales each October. In the mid-to-late 1990s, the film was rebroadcast annually on ABC and Disney Channel before switching over to ABC Family's 13 Nights of Halloween lineup in the early 2000s. The film has continuously brought record viewing numbers to the lineup, including a 2009 broadcast watched by 2.5 million viewers. In 2011, an October 29 airing became the lineup's most watched program, with 2.8 million viewers. On September 4, 2012, the film was released on Blu-ray. Disney re-released the film on Blu-ray and Digital HD on September 2, 2018, as part of the film's 25th anniversary. The new release contains special features, including deleted scenes and a behind- the-scenes retrospective. Music The musical score for Hocus Pocus was composed and conducted by John Debney. James Horner was originally slated to score the film, but became unavailable at the last minute, so Debney had to score the entire film in two weeks. Even though he didn't score the film, Horner came back to write the theme for Sarah (sung by Sarah Jessica Parker, more commonly known as \\"Come Little Children\\") which is featured in Intrada's Complete Edition of the score. Debney released a promotional score through the internet containing 19 tracks from the film. Bootlegs were subsequently released across the internet, primarily because the promotional release missed the entire opening sequence music. ; Songs * \\"Sarah's Theme\\" ‚Äì music by James Horner; lyrics by Brock Walsh; performed by Sarah Jessica Parker * \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" ‚Äì written by Jay Hawkins and produced and arranged by Marc Shaiman; performed by Bette Midler * \\"Witchcraft\\" ‚Äì written by Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh; performed by Joe Malone * \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" ‚Äì written by Jay Hawkins; performed by Joe Malone * \\"Sabre Dance\\" ‚Äì written by George Wilson * Chants and Incantations ‚Äì conceived and written by Brock Walsh Reception =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 37%, based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 4.61/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Harmlessly hokey yet never much more than mediocre, Hocus Pocus is a muddled family-friendly effort that fails to live up to the talents of its impressive cast\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Gene Siskel, reviewing for The Chicago Tribune, remarked that the film was a \\"dreadful witches' comedy with the only tolerable moment coming when Bette Midler presents a single song.\\" Roger Ebert in The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one star out of a possible four, writing that it was \\"a confusing cauldron in which there is great activity but little progress, and a lot of hysterical shrieking\\". The Miami Herald called it \\"a pretty lackluster affair\\", adding this comment: \\"Despite the triple-threat actress combo, Hocus Pocus won't be the Sister Act of 1993. There are a lot of gotta-sees this summer, and this isn't one of them.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"has flashes of visual stylishness but virtually no grip on its story\\". Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C-, calling it \\"acceptable scary-silly kid fodder that adults will find only mildly insulting. Unless they're Bette Midler fans. In which case it's depressing as hell\\"; and stating that while Najimy and Parker \\"have their moments of ramshackle comic inspiration, and the passable special effects should keep younger campers transfixed [...] [T]he sight of the Divine Miss M. mugging her way through a cheesy supernatural kiddie comedy is, to say the least, dispiriting.\\" =Box office= Hocus Pocus was released July 16, 1993, and came in fourth place on its opening weekend, grossing $8.1 million. It dropped from the top ten ranking after two weeks of release. The film was released the same day as Free Willy. According to Kirschner, Disney chose to release Hocus Pocus in July to take advantage of children being off from school for the summer. In October 2020, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Hocus Pocus was re- released in 2,570 theaters. It made $1.9 million over the weekend, finishing second behind Tenet.https://variety.com/2020/film/news/hocus-pocus-box-office- rerelease-1234791512/ The following two weekends it made $1.2 million and $756,000, respectively. Legacy Midler dressed as Winifred Sanderson during her Divine Intervention Tour in 2015 Over the years, through various outlets such as strong DVD sales and annual record-breaking showings on Freeform's 13 Nights of Halloween, the film has achieved cult status. Various media outlets such as Celebuzz and Oh No They Didn't have reiterated such claims. In its 25th anniversary year in 2018, the first week of Hocus Pocus viewings on Freeform averaged 8.2 million viewers. A special called the \\"Hocus Pocus 25th Anniversary Halloween Bash\\" was filmed at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery and features interviews with members of the cast, including Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy, as well as a costume contest hosted by Sharon and Kelly Osbourne. It aired on Freeform October 20, 2018. In October 2011, the Houston Symphony celebrated various horror and Halloween classics, including Hocus Pocus, with \\"The Hocus Pocus Pops.\\" On October 19, 2013, D23 held a special screening of Hocus Pocus at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, to honor the 20th anniversary of the film. Nine of the cast and crew gathered for the screening, and hundreds of D23 members attended. Returning members included Kathy Najimy, David Kirschner, Thora Birch, Doug Jones, Vinessa Shaw, and Omri Katz.Billy Stanek (October 22, 2013). \\"D23 Members Run Amok at the Hocus Pocus 20th Anniversary Screening\\". D23 (Disney). Retrieved January 24, 2014. During her Divine Intervention Tour in 2015, Bette Midler appeared on stage dressed as Winifred Sanderson. Her Harlettes appeared with her dressed as Mary and Sarah, and the three of them performed the film's version of \\"I Put a Spell on You\\". On September 15, 2015, the Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular was introduced at the Magic Kingdom as a part of Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party. The show introduces new actresses as the Sanderson Sisters, who try to make a villain party and summon or attract various Disney villains in the process. In September 2016, entertainment critic Aaron Wallace published Hocus Pocus in Focus: The Thinking Fan's Guide to Disney's Halloween Classic, the first full-length book written about the movie. The book includes a foreword by Thora Birch and afterword by Mick Garris. Billed as a \\"lighthearted but scholarly look at the film,\\" the book analyzes the movie's major themes, which it identifies as festivity, nostalgia, home, horror, virginity, feminism, Broadway-style musical moments, sibling rivalry, \\"Spielbergian\\" filmmaking style, Disney villain traditions, and more. Wallace also analyzes Walt Disney World's Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular as part of the movie's legacy and includes \\"the largest collection of Hocus Pocus fun facts and trivia ever assembled,\\" complete with extensive endnote citations. The City of Salem has celebrated its connection to Hocus Pocus, while local filming sites have become an attraction for fans as the movie's legacy has grown over the years. In 2018, the Haunted Happenings Grand Parade, an annual Salem festival held every October, was Hocus-Pocus themed in honor of the movie's 25th anniversary. A representative for Destination Salem also reported a huge uptick in tourism for the 25th anniversary year, stating: \\"There‚Äôs always been a ‚ÄòHocus Pocus‚Äô component to the visitors to Salem, especially in October. But it's like the film's following grows every year.‚Äù Sequel In July 2014, it was announced that Disney was developing a supernatural-themed film about witches, and that Tina Fey was on board as a producer and star. However, Deadline debunked rumors that the film was a sequel to Hocus Pocus. In November 2014, Bette Midler said in an interview that she was ready and willing to return for a sequel. She also said her co-stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy were interested in reprising the roles of the Sanderson sisters as well, but stressed that Disney had yet to greenlight any sequel. In November 2015, Midler stated in a Facebook Q&A; that \\"after all these years and all the fan demand, I do believe I can stand and firmly say an unequivocal no\\" in response to a question about a sequel. In June 2016, actor Doug Jones mentioned that Disney had been considering a sequel, and behind the scenes discussions were in place to possibly continue the series. In October 2016, Sarah Jessica Parker was asked by Andy Cohen about a sequel. Her response was, \\"I would love that. I think we've been very vocal that we're very keen.\\" In Hocus Pocus in Focus: The Thinking Fan's Guide to Disney's Halloween Classic, author Aaron Wallace identifies several potential approaches for a sequel, but notes that the project's biggest challenge is the Walt Disney Studios' interest in tentpole projects that promise very high box office returns.Wallace, Aaron. Hocus Pocus in Focus: The Thinking Fan's Guide to Disney's Halloween Classic. Pensive Pen Publishing 2016. Epilogue. http://www.aaronwallaceonline.com/book/hocus-pocus- book-thinking-fan-disney/ In September 2017, screenwriter Mick Garris admitted that he was working on a script for Hocus Pocus 2 and that it would potentially be developed as a television film for Disney Channel, Freeform or ABC. It was later confirmed that it will instead be a remake to air on Freeform, with The Royals writer Scarlett Lacey attached to write, and the original film producer David Kirschner executive producing. The following month, Midler said she was not fond of the idea of a remake and she would not be taking part in it. In July 2018, a book titled Hocus Pocus and the All-New Sequel was released, containing a novelization of the film and a sequel story. The sequel focuses on Max and Allison's daughter, Poppy, who grew up hearing the family story of the first film and parents who avoid Halloween as much as possible. Poppy is skeptical of the tale and ends up in the Sanderson house on Halloween, twenty-five years to the day after the movie, in an attempt to prove there's nothing to the story. In October 2019, a sequel was announced to be in development as a Disney+ exclusive film, with a screenplay written by Jen D'Angelo. Shortly after the report, Midler, Parker, and Najimy all confirmed their interest in reprising their roles. In March 2020, Adam Shankman signed on to direct.

It is based on the Chinese philosophies of Wu Xing (five elements, phases) and yin and yang, introduced into Japan at the beginning of the 6th century. It was accepted as a practical system of divination. These practices were influenced further by Taoism, Buddhism and Shintoism, and evolved into the system of onmy≈çd≈ç around the late 7th century. Onmy≈çd≈ç was under the control of the imperial government, and later its courtiers, the Tsuchimikado family, until the middle of the 19th century, at which point it became prohibited as superstition. Development In the 5th and 6th centuries, the principles of yin-yang and the Five Elements were transmitted to Japan from China and Baekje along with Buddhism and Confucianism, particularly by the obscure Korean monk Gwalleuk. Yin-yang and the Five Elements, as well as the divisions of learning to which they were linked ‚Äì astronomy, calendar-making, the reckoning of time, divination, and studies based on observation of nature ‚Äì were amalgamated into fortune telling. This process of judging auspicious or harmful signs present in the natural world, was accepted into Japanese society as a technique for predicting good or bad fortune in the human world. Such techniques were known mostly by Buddhist monks from mainland Asia, who were knowledgeable in reading and writing Chinese. Over time, demand from members of the imperial court who believed that onmy≈çd≈ç divination would be helpful in decision-making, made it necessary for the laity to perform the art, and onmy≈çji began to appear around the middle of the 7th century. During the Heian period the nobility organized their lives around practices recommended by onmy≈çji. The practice of \\"lucky and unlucky directions\\" provides an example. Depending on the season, time of day, and other circumstances, a particular direction might be bad luck for an individual. If one's house was located in that direction, such an individual was advised not to go back directly to his house but had to \\"change direction\\" (katatagae), by going in a different direction and lodging there. Such a person would not dare to go in the forbidden direction, but stayed where they were, even if that resulted in absence from the court, or passing up invitations from influential people. In the 10th century and his son Kamo no Yasunori, made great advancements in onmy≈çd≈ç, astronomy and calendar science. From among their students emerged Abe no Seimei, who displayed superior skills in the divining arts of onmy≈çd≈ç, by which he gained an uncommon amount of trust from the court society. Tadayuki and Yasunori passed on their skills in astronomy to Seimei while their advances in calendar-making went to Yasunori's son. From the end of the Heian period into the Middle Ages, astronomy and calendar science were completely subsumed into onmy≈çd≈ç, and the Abe and Kamo families came to dominate the art. Onmy≈çji was one of the classifications of civil servants belonging to the Bureau of Onmy≈ç in ancient Japan's ritsuryo system. People with this title were professional practitioners of onmy≈çd≈ç. Onmy≈çji were specialists in magic and divination. Their court responsibilities ranged from tasks such as keeping track of the calendar, to mystical duties such as divination and protection of the capital from evil spirits. They could divine auspicious or harmful influences in the earth, and were instrumental in the moving of capitals. It is said that an onmy≈çji could also summon and control shikigami. Famous onmy≈çji include Kamo no Yasunori and Abe no Seimei (921‚Äì1005). After Seimei's death, the emperor had a shrine erected at his home in Kyoto. Onmy≈çji had political clout during the Heian period, but in later times when the imperial court fell into decline, their state patronage was lost completely. In modern-day Japan onmy≈çji are defined as a type of priest, and although there are many who claim to be mediums and spiritualists, the onmy≈çji continues to be a hallmark occult figure.

The orange mats are composed of Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, and other organisms that thrive in the 70ÀöC water. Geobiologists often study extreme environments like this because they are home to extremophilic organisms. It has been hypothesized that these environments may be representative of early Earth. Geobiology is a field of scientific research that explores the interactions between the physical Earth and the biosphere. It is a relatively young field, and its borders are fluid. There is considerable overlap with the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, microbiology, paleontology, and particularly soil science and biogeochemistry. Geobiology applies the principles and methods of biology, geology, and soil science to the study of the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth as well as the role of life in the modern world. Geobiologic studies tend to be focused on microorganisms, and on the role that life plays in altering the chemical and physical environment of the pedosphere, which exists at the intersection of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and/or cryosphere. It differs from biogeochemistry in that the focus is on processes and organisms over space and time rather than on global chemical cycles. Geobiological research synthesizes the geologic record with modern biologic studies. It deals with process - how organisms affect the Earth and vice versa - as well as history - how the Earth and life have changed together. Much research is grounded in the search for fundamental understanding, but geobiology can also be applied, as in the case of microbes that clean up oil spills. Geobiology employs molecular biology, environmental microbiology, chemical analyses, and the geologic record to investigate the evolutionary interconnectedness of life and Earth. It attempts to understand how the Earth has changed since the origin of life and what it might have been like along the way. Some definitions of geobiology even push the boundaries of this time frame - to understanding the origin of life and to the role that man has played and will continue to play in shaping the Earth in the Anthropocene.  History  A microbial mat in White Creek, Yellowstone National Park, USA. Note the conical microstructure of the bacterial communities. These are hypothesized to be a living analogue of ancient fossil stromatolites. Each cone has an oxygen gas bubble on top, the product of oxygenic photosynthesis by cyanobacteria in the multi-species microbial mats. The term geobiology was coined by Lourens Baas Becking in 1934. In his words, geobiology \\"is an attempt to describe the relationship between organisms and the Earth,\\" for \\"the organism is part of the Earth and its lot is interwoven with that of the Earth.\\" Baas Becking's definition of geobiology was born of a desire to unify environmental biology with laboratory biology. The way he practiced it aligns closely with modern environmental microbial ecology, though his definition remains applicable to all of geobiology. In his book, Geobiology, Bass Becking stated that he had no intention of inventing a new field of study. Baas Becking's understanding of geobiology was heavily influenced by his predecessors, including Martinus Beyerinck, his teacher from the Dutch School of Microbiology. Others included Vladimir Vernadsky, who argued that life changes the surface environment of Earth in The Biosphere, his 1926 book, and Sergei Vinogradsky, famous for discovering lithotrophic bacteria.Winogradsky, Sergei (1887). \\"√úber Schwefelbakterien\\". Bot. Zeitung (45): 489‚Äì610. The first laboratory officially dedicated to the study of geobiology was the Baas Becking Geobiological Laboratory in Australia, which opened its doors in 1965. However, it took another 40 or so years for geobiology to become a firmly rooted scientific discipline, thanks in part to advances in geochemistry and genetics that enabled scientists to begin to synthesize the study of life and planet. In the 1930s, Alfred Treibs discovered chlorophyll-like porphyrins in petroleum, confirming its biological origin, thereby founding organic geochemistry and establishing the notion of biomarkers,Gaines, S. M. (2008). Echoes of Life: What Fossil Molecules Reveal about Earth History: What Fossil Molecules Reveal about Earth History. Oxford University Press, USA. a critical aspect of geobiology. But several decades passed before the tools were available to begin to search in earnest for chemical marks of life in the rocks. In the 1970s and '80s, scientists like Geoffrey Eglington and Roger Summons began to find lipid biomarkers in the rock record using equipment like GCMS. On the biology side of things, in 1977, Carl Woese and George Fox published a phylogeny of life on Earth, including a new domain - the Archaea. And in the 1990s, genetics and genomics studies became possible, broadening the scope of investigation of the interaction of life and planet. Today, geobiology has its own journals, such as Geobiology, established in 2003, and Biogeosciences, established in 2004, as well as recognition at major scientific conferences. It got its own Gordon Research Conference in 2011, a number of geobiology textbooks have been published, and many universities around the world offer degree programs in geobiology (see External links).  Major geobiological events  The geologic timescale overlain with major geobiologic events and occurrences. The oxygenation of the atmosphere is shown in blue starting 2.4 Ga, although the exact dating of the Great Oxygenation Event is debated. Perhaps the most profound geobiological event is the introduction of oxygen into the atmosphere by photosynthetic bacteria. This oxygenation of Earth's primordial atmosphere (the so-called oxygen catastrophe or Great Oxygenation Event) and the oxygenation of the oceans altered surface biogeochemical cycles and the types of organisms that have been evolutionarily selected for. A subsequent major change was the advent of multicellularity. The presence of oxygen allowed eukaryotes and, later, multicellular life to evolve. More anthropocentric geobiologic events include the origin of animals and the establishment of terrestrial plant life, which affected continental erosion and nutrient cycling, and likely changed the types of rivers observed, allowing channelization of what were previously predominantly braided rivers. More subtle geobiological events include the role of termites in overturning sediments, coral reefs in depositing calcium carbonate and breaking waves, sponges in absorbing dissolved marine silica, the role of dinosaurs in breaching river levees and promoting flooding, and the role of large mammal dung in distributing nutrients.  Important concepts  Geobiology is founded upon a few core concepts that unite the study of Earth and life. While there are many aspects of studying past and present interactions between life and Earth that are unclear, several important ideas and concepts provide a basis of knowledge in geobiology that serve as a platform for posing researchable questions, including the evolution of life and planet and the co-evolution of the two, genetics - from both a historical and functional standpoint, the metabolic diversity of all life, the sedimentological preservation of past life, and the origin of life. = Co-evolution of life and Earth = A core concept in geobiology is that life changes over time through evolution. The theory of evolution postulates that unique populations of organisms or species arose from genetic modifications in the ancestral population which were passed down by drift and natural selection.Darwin, C. (1859). On the origin of species London. UK: John Murray. Along with standard biological evolution, life and planet co-evolve. Since the best adaptations are those that suit the ecological niche that the organism lives in, the physical and chemical characteristics of the environment drive the evolution of life by natural selection, but the opposite can also be true: with every advent of evolution, the environment changes. A classic example of co-evolution is the evolution of oxygen-producing photosynthetic cyanobacteria which oxygenated Earth's Archean atmosphere. The ancestors of cyanobacteria began using water as an electron source to harness the energy of the sun and expelling oxygen before or during the early Paleoproterozoic. During this time, around 2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago, geologic data suggests that atmospheric oxygen began to rise in what is termed the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE). It is unclear for how long cyanobacteria had been doing oxygenic photosynthesis before the GOE. Some evidence suggests there were geochemical \\"buffers\\" or sinks suppressing the rise of oxygen such as volcanism though cyanobacteria may have been around producing it before the GOE. Other evidence indicates that the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis was coincident with the GOE. Banded iron formation (BIF), Hammersley Formation, Western Australia The presence of oxygen on Earth from its first production by cyanobacteria to the GOE and through today has drastically impacted the course of evolution of life and planet. It may have triggered the formation of oxidized minerals and the disappearance of oxidizable minerals like pyrite from ancient stream beds. The presence of banded-iron formations (BIFs) have been interpreted as a clue for the rise of oxygen since small amounts of oxygen could have reacted with reduced ferrous iron (Fe(II)) in the oceans, resulting in the deposition of sediments containing Fe(III) oxide in places like Western Australia. However, any oxidizing environment, including that provided by microbes such as the iron- oxidizing photoautotroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris, can trigger iron oxide formation and thus BIF deposition. Other mechanisms include oxidation by UV light. Indeed, BIFs occur across large swaths of Earth's history and may not correlate with only one event. Other changes correlated with the rise of oxygen include the appearance of rust-red ancient paleosols, different isotope fractionation of elements such as sulfur, and global glaciations and Snowball Earth events, perhaps caused by the oxidation of methane by oxygen, not to mention an overhaul of the types of organisms and metabolisms on Earth. Whereas organisms prior to the rise of oxygen were likely poisoned by oxygen gas as many anaerobes are today, those that evolved ways to harness the electron-accepting and energy-giving power of oxygen were poised to thrive and colonize the aerobic environment. Modern, living stromatolites in Shark Bay, Australia. Shark Bay is one of the few places in the world where stromatolites can be seen today, though they were likely common in ancient shallow seas before the rise of metazoan predators. = The Earth has changed = Earth has not remained the same since its planetary formation 4.5 billion years ago. Continents have formed, broken up, and collided, offering new opportunities for and barriers to the dispersal of life. The redox state of the atmosphere and the oceans has changed, as indicated by isotope data. Fluctuating quantities of inorganic compounds such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, methane, and oxygen have been driven by life evolving new biological metabolisms to make these chemicals and have driven the evolution of new metabolisms to use those chemicals. Earth acquired a magnetic field about 3.4 Ga that has undergone a series of geomagnetic reversals on the order of millions of years. The surface temperature is in constant fluctuation, falling in glaciations and Snowball Earth events due to ice-albedo feedback, rising and melting due to volcanic outgassing, and stabilizing due to silicate weathering feedback. And the Earth is not the only one that changed - the luminosity of the sun has increased over time. Because rocks record a history of relatively constant temperatures since Earth's beginnings, there must have been more greenhouse gasses to keep the temperatures up in the Archean when the sun was younger and fainter. All these major differences in the environment of the Earth placed very different constraints on the evolution of life throughout our planet's history. Moreover, more subtle changes in the habitat of life are always occurring, shaping the organisms and traces that we observe today and in the rock record. = Genes encode geobiological function and history = The genetic code is key to observing the history of evolution and understanding the capabilities of organisms. Genes are the basic unit of inheritance and function and, as such, they are the basic unit of evolution and the means behind metabolism.  Phylogeny predicts evolutionary history  A phylogenetic tree of living things, based on rRNA data and proposed by Carl Woese, showing the separation of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes and linking the three branches of living organisms to the LUCA (the black trunk at the bottom of the tree).Phylogeny takes genetic sequences from living organisms and compares them to each other to reveal evolutionary relationships, much like a family tree reveals how individuals are connected to their distant cousins.Nei, M., & Kumar, S. (2000). Molecular evolution and phylogenetics. Oxford university press. It allows us to decipher modern relationships and infer how evolution happened in the past. Phylogeny can give some sense of history when combined with a little bit more information. Each difference in the DNA indicates divergence between one species and another. This divergence, whether via drift or natural selection, is representative of some lapse of time. Comparing DNA sequences alone gives a record of the history of evolution with an arbitrary measure of phylogenetic distance ‚Äúdating‚Äù that last common ancestor. However, if information about the rate of genetic mutation is available or geologic markers are present to calibrate evolutionary divergence (i.e. fossils), we have a timeline of evolution. From there, with an idea about other contemporaneous changes in life and environment, we can begin to speculate why certain evolutionary paths might have been selected for.  Genes encode metabolism  Molecular biology allows scientists to understand a gene's function using microbial culturing and mutagenesis. Searching for similar genes in other organisms and in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data allows us to understand what processes could be relevant and important in a given ecosystem, providing insight into the biogeochemical cycles in that environment. For example, an intriguing problem in geobiology is the role of organisms in the global cycling of methane. Genetics has revealed that the methane monooxygenase gene (pmo) is used for oxidizing methane and is present in all aerobic methane-oxidizers, or methanotrophs. The presence of DNA sequences of the pmo gene in the environment can be used as a proxy for methanotrophy. A more generalizable tool is the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, which is found in bacteria and archaea. This gene evolves very slowly over time and is not usually horizontally transferred, and so it is often used to distinguish different taxonomic units of organisms in the environment. In this way, genes are clues to organismal metabolism and identity. Genetics enables us to ask 'who is there?' and 'what are they doing?' This approach is called metagenomics. 3.4 billion year-old stromatolites from the Warrawoona Group, Western Australia. While the origin of Precambrian stromatolites is a heavily debated topic in geobiology, stromatolites from Warrawoona are hypothesized to have been formed by ancient communities of microbes. = Metabolic diversity influences the environment = Life harnesses chemical reactions to generate energy, perform biosynthesis, and eliminate waste.Berg, J. M., Tymoczko, J. L., & Stryer, L. (2002). Biochemistry. 5th. Different organisms use very different metabolic approaches to meet these basic needs. While animals such as ourselves are limited to aerobic respiration, other organisms can \\"breathe\\" sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), ferric iron (Fe(III)), and uranium (U(VI)), or live off energy from fermentation. Some organisms, like plants, are autotrophs, meaning that they can fix carbon dioxide for biosynthesis. Plants are photoautotrophs, in that they use the energy of light to fix carbon. Microorganisms employ oxygenic and anoxygenic photoautotrophy, as well as chemoautotrophy. Microbial communities can coordinate in syntrophic metabolisms to shift reaction kinetics in their favor. Many organisms can perform multiple metabolisms to achieve the same end goal; these are called mixotrophs. Biotic metabolism is directly tied to the global cycling of elements and compounds on Earth. The geochemical environment fuels life, which then produces different molecules that go into the external environment. (This is directly relevant to biogeochemistry.) In addition, biochemical reactions are catalyzed by enzymes which sometimes prefer one isotope over others. For example, oxygenic photosynthesis is catalyzed by RuBisCO, which prefers carbon-12 over carbon-13, resulting in carbon isotope fractionation in the rock record. \\"Giant\\" ooids of the Johnnie Formation in the Death Valley area, California, USA. Ooids are near-spheroidal calcium carbonate grains that accumulate around a central nucleus and can be sedimented to form oolite like this. Microbes can mediate the formation of ooids. = Sedimentary rocks tell a story = Sedimentary rocks preserve remnants of the history of life on Earth in the form of fossils, biomarkers, isotopes, and other traces. The rock record is far from perfect, and the preservation of biosignatures is a rare occurrence. Understanding what factors determine the extent of preservation and the meaning behind what is preserved are important components to detangling the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth. The sedimentary record allows scientists to observe changes in life and Earth in composition over time and sometimes even date major transitions, like extinction events. Some classic examples of geobiology in the sedimentary record include stromatolites and banded-iron formations. The role of life in the origin of both of these is a heavily debated topic. = Life is fundamentally chemistry = The first life arose from abiotic chemical reactions. When this happened, how it happened, and even what planet it happened on are uncertain. However, life follows the rules of and arose from lifeless chemistry and physics. It is constrained by principles such as thermodynamics. This is an important concept in the field because it is represents the epitome of the interconnectedness, if not sameness, of life and Earth. While often delegated to the field of astrobiology, attempts to understand how and when life arose are relevant to geobiology as well. The first major strides towards understanding the ‚Äúhow‚Äù came with the Miller-Urey experiment, when amino acids formed out of a simulated ‚Äúprimordial soup‚Äù. Another theory is that life originated in a system much like the hydrothermal vents at mid-oceanic spreading centers. In the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a variety of hydrocarbons form under vent-like conditions. Other ideas include the ‚ÄúRNA World‚Äù hypothesis, which postulates that the first biologic molecule was RNA and the idea that life originated elsewhere in the solar system and was brought to Earth, perhaps via a meteorite.  Methodology  A microbial mat growing on acidic soil in Norris Geyser basin, Yellowstone National Park, USA. The black top serves as a sort of sunscreen, and when you look underneath you see the green cyanobacteria. While geobiology is a diverse and varied field, encompassing ideas and techniques from a wide range of disciplines, there are a number of important methods that are key to the study of the interaction of life and Earth that are highlighted here. # Laboratory culturing of microbes is used to characterize the metabolism and lifestyle of organisms of interest. # Gene sequencing allows scientists to study the relationships between extant organisms using phylogenetics. # Experimental genetic manipulation or mutagenesis is used to determine the function of genes in living organisms. # Microscopy is used to visualize the microbial world. Microscope work ranges from environmental observation to quantitative studies with DNA probes to high-definition visualization of the microbe-mineral interface by electron microscope (EM). # Isotope tracers can be used to track biochemical reactions to understand microbial metabolism. # Isotope natural abundance in rocks can be measured to look for isotopic fractionation that is consistent with biologic origin. # Detailed environmental characterization is important to understanding what about a habitat might be driving life's evolution and, in turn, how life might be changing that niche. It includes and is not limited to, temperature, light, pH, salinity, concentration of specific molecules like oxygen, and the biologic community. # Sedimentology and stratigraphy are used to read the rocks. The rock record stores a history of geobiologic processes in sediments which can be unearthed through an understanding of deposition, sedimentation, compaction, diagenesis, and deformation. # The search for and study of fossils, while often delegated to the separate field of paleontology, is important in geobiology, though the scale of fossils is typically smaller (micropaleontology). # The biochemical analysis of biomarkers, which are fossilized or modern molecules that are indicative of the presence of a certain group of organisms or metabolism, is used to answer the evidence for life and metabolic diversity questions. # Paleomagnetics is the study of the planet's ancient magnetic field. It is significant to understanding magnetofossils, biomineralization, and global ecosystem changes.  Sub-disciplines and related fields  As its name suggests, geobiology is closely related to many other fields of study, and does not have clearly defined boundaries or perfect agreement on what exactly they comprise. Some practitioners take a very broad view of its boundaries, encompassing many older, more established fields such as biogeochemistry, paleontology, and microbial ecology. Others take a more narrow view, assigning it to emerging research that falls between these existing fields, such as with geomicrobiology. The following list includes both those that are clearly a part of geobiology, e.g. geomicrobiology, as well as those that share scientific interests but have not historically been considered a sub- discipline of geobiology, e.g. paleontology. = Astrobiology = Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary field that uses a combination of geobiological and planetary science data to establish a context for the search for life on other planets. The origin of life from non-living chemistry and geology, or abiogenesis, is a major topic in astrobiology. Even though it is fundamentally an earth-bound concern, and therefore of great geobiological interest, getting at the origin of life necessitates considering what life requires, what, if anything, is special about Earth, what might have changed to allow life to blossom, what constitutes evidence for life, and even what constitutes life itself. These are the same questions that scientists might ask when searching for alien life. In addition, astrobiologists research the possibility of life based on other metabolisms and elements, the survivability of Earth's organisms on other planets or spacecrafts, planetary and solar system evolution, and space geochemistry. = Biogeochemistry = Biogeochemistry is a systems science that synthesizes the study of biological, geological, and chemical processes to understand the reactions and composition of the natural environment. It is concerned primarily with global elemental cycles, such as that of nitrogen and carbon. The father of biogeochemistry was James Lovelock, whose ‚ÄúGaia hypothesis‚Äù proposed that Earth's biological, chemical, and geologic systems interact to stabilize the conditions on Earth that support life. = Geobiochemistry = Stromatolites in the Green River Shale, Wyoming, USA, dating to the EoceneGeobiochemistry is similar to biogeochemistry, but differs by placing emphasis on the effects of geology on the development of life's biochemical processes, as distinct from the role of life on Earth's cycles. Its primary goal is to link biological changes, encompassing evolutionary modifications of genes and changes in the expression of genes and proteins, to changes in the temperature, pressure, and composition of geochemical processes to understand when and how metabolism evolved. Geobiochemistry is founded on the notion that life is a planetary response because metabolic catalysis enables the release of energy trapped by a cooling planet. = Environmental microbiology = Microbiology is a broad scientific discipline pertaining to the study of that life which is best viewed under a microscope. It encompasses several fields that are of direct relevance to geobiology, and the tools of microbiology all pertain to geobiology. Environmental microbiology is especially entangled in geobiology since it seeks an understanding of the actual organisms and processes that are relevant in nature, as opposed to the traditional lab-based approach to microbiology. Microbial ecology is similar, but tend to focus more on lab studies and the relationships between organisms within a community, as well as within the ecosystem of their chemical and geological physical environment. Both rely on techniques such as sample collection from diverse environments, metagenomics, DNA sequencing, and statistics. = Geomicrobiology and microbial geochemistry = A vertical cross section of a microbial mat containing different organisms that perform different metabolisms. The green are presumably cyanobacteria, and teepee-like microstructures are visible on the surface.Geomicrobiology traditionally studies the interactions between microbes and minerals. While it is generally reliant on the tools of microbiology, microbial geochemistry uses geological and chemical methods to approach the same topic from the perspective of the rocks. Geomicrobiology and microbial geochemistry (GMG) is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that more broadly takes on the relationship between microbes, Earth, and environmental systems. Billed as a subset of both geobiology and geochemistry, GMG seeks to understand elemental biogeochemical cycles and the evolution of life on Earth. Specifically, it asks questions about where microbes live, their local and global abundance, their structural and functional biochemistry, how they have evolved, biomineralization, and their preservation potential and presence in the rock record. In many ways, GMG appears to be equivalent to geobiology, but differs in scope: geobiology focuses on the role of all life, while GMG is strictly microbial. Regardless, it is these tiniest creatures that dominated to history of life integrated over time and seem to have had the most far-reaching effects. = Molecular geomicrobiology = Molecular geomicrobiology takes a mechanistic approach to understanding biological processes that are geologically relevant. It can be at the level of DNA, protein, lipids, or any metabolite. One example of Molecular geomicrobiology research is studying how recently created lava fields are colonized by microbes. The University of Helskinki is currently conducting research to determine what specific microbial traits are necessary for successful initial colonization, and how waves of microbial succession can transform the volcanic rock into fertile soil. = Organic geochemistry = Organic geochemistry is the study of organic molecules that appear in the fossil record in sedimentary rocks. Research in this field concerns molecular fossils that are often lipid biomarkers. Molecules like sterols and hopanoids, membrane lipids found in eukaryotes and bacteria, respectively, can be preserved in the rock record on billion-year timescales. Following the death of the organism they came from and sedimentation, they undergo a process called diagenesis whereby many of the specific functional groups from the lipids are lost, but the hydrocarbon skeleton remains intact. These fossilized lipids are called steranes and hopanes, respectively. There are also other types of molecular fossils, like porphyrins, the discovery of which in petroleum by Alfred E. Treibs actually led to the invention of the field. Other aspects of geochemistry that are also pertinent to geobiology include isotope geochemistry, in which scientists search for isotope fractionation in the rock record, and the chemical analysis of biominerals, such as magnetite or microbially-precipitated gold. Mistaken Point, Newfoundland. Ediacaran biota originated during the Ediacaran Period and are unlike most animals around today. = Paleontology = Perhaps the oldest of the bunch, paleontology is the study of fossils. It involves the discovery, excavation, dating, and paleoecological understanding of any type of fossil, microbial or dinosaur, trace or body fossil. Micropaleontology is particularly relevant to geobiology. Putative bacterial microfossils and ancient stromatolites are used as evidence for the rise of metabolisms such as oxygenic photosynthesis. The search for molecular fossils, such as lipid biomarkers like steranes and hopanes, has also played an important role in geobiology and organic geochemistry. Relevant sub-disciples include paleoecology and paleobiogeoraphy. = Biogeography = Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of life through time. It can look at the present distribution of organisms across continents or between microniches, or the distribution of organisms through time, or in the past, which is called paleobiogeography. = Evolutionary biology = Evolutionary biology is the study of the evolutionary processes that have shaped the diversity of life on Earth.

This was the last NFL playoff tournament before the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger and the last awarding of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy to the NFL champion, which was introduced in 1934. Tournament bracket The four-team postseason format was introduced for the season, when the NFL expanded to 16 teams and realigned into four division with four teams each. Within each conference, the two division winners qualified for the playoffs. In the first round, the Capitol winner met the Century winner in the Eastern Conference game, while the Coastal and Central played for the Western Conference title. The winners of the two conference games advanced to the NFL Championship Game to compete for the NFL league title and the right to face the American Football League champion in Super Bowl IV. The losers of the conference championship games played in the Playoff Bowl, a third place game at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida; the Playoff Bowl of January 1970 was its tenth and final edition. Prior to , the playoff sites rotated and were known prior to the start of the season. In , the hosts were the Capitol and Central division winners for the conference championships (first round), and the Western Conference for the championship game. This gave home field advantage to the Central Division winner, the Minnesota Vikings (12‚Äì2), which had the league's best record. The previous year's playoff hosts were Century, Coastal, and Eastern, respectively, and 1967 was like 1969. All three playoff games in 1969 were hosted by the team with the better regular season record. Conference championships =Saturday, December 27, 1969= Western Conference: Minnesota Vikings 23, Los Angeles Rams 20 Three weeks prior to this game, the teams met in Los Angeles in a battle between the undefeated (11‚Äì0) Rams and the 10‚Äì1 Vikings. The Vikings won that game 20‚Äì13. The rematch was played in the cold and snow of Minnesota. Despite committing more turnovers (3 to 1) and only gaining 20 more total yards (275-255), the Vikings managed to edge out the Rams for their first postseason win in franchise history. In the game in L.A., the Viking defense shut down the Rams' wide receivers and outside running game, so in this game, the Rams attacked the middle of the Viking defense and neutralized the Viking pass rush with short quick passes to the tight ends. The Rams defense held Minnesota's high powered offense in check, with the \\"Fearsome Foursome\\" defensive line harassing Viking QB Joe Kapp. Early on, the momentum seemed to be in LA's favor. Rams safety Richie Petitbon recovered a fumble from fullback Bill Brown that gave his team a first down on the Minnesota 45-yard line. On the next play, it appeared that the Vikings took a quick lead as Carl Eller intercepted a Roman Gabriel pass and returned for a touchdown but the score was nullified on an offside penalty on Alan Page. Taking advantage of their second chance, running back Larry Smith gained 19 yards on three carries, and Gabriel eventually finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Bob Klein. The Vikings quickly stormed back, with Kapp completing four consecutive passes on a 10-play, 75-yard drive. Three of the completions were to receiver Gene Washington for 49 total yards, including a 27-yard reception that gave the Vikings the ball on the Rams' 4-yard line. Dave Osborn ran for a touchdown on the next play, tying the score at 7 with a little over 3 minutes left in the first quarter. LA moved the ball effectively on their next drive, but it ended on a missed 38-yard field goal attempt by Bruce Gossett. The next time they got the ball, they did much better, taking up the majority of the second quarter, including a 13-yard run by Gabriel to convert a third down. Gossett finished the drive with a 20-yard field goal to put the Rams up 10-7 with 4:30 left before halftime. Following a punt, Gabriel led his team back for more points. This time he completed passes to tight end Billy Truax for gains of 18 and 16 yards before finishing the 13-play, 65-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Truax. The Rams went into halftime leading 17-7, having scored on three of their four first half possessions. In the second half, Viking coach Bud Grant adjusted his defense to stop the Ram tight ends, and his \\"Purple People Eaters\\" continued to punish the Ram running game. They also got increasing pressure on Gabriel. On offense, Grant neutralized the Ram pass rush by having QB Kapp run the ball, either on designed plays like quarterback draws or roll outs, or by instructing him to take off and run at the first sign of pressure. Kapp began frustrating the Rams with runs; this threat caused their pass rush to be less aggressive. After forcing the Rams to punt for the first time in the game on the opening possession of the second half, Kapp completed a 41-yard pass to Washington on the LA 12-yard line. After a Rams penalty and a 5-yard run by Kapp, Osborn finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run that cut Minnesota's deficit to 17-14. However, Minnesota's comeback attempt suffered major setbacks over the next few drives against a punishing effort from the Rams defense. The next time the Vikings got the ball, they drove deep into Rams territory, only to have Kapp throw an interception to safety Ed Meador on the LA 4-yard line. Meador fumbled the ball during the return, but linebacker Jim Purnell recovered it. After an LA punt, Kapp was intercepted again, this time by Petitbon, who returned the ball 4 yards to the Vikings' 36. Once again, the Viking defense bent but didn't break, stopping the Rams inside the 10 yard line and making them settle for a 27-yard Gossett field goal. So instead of being down 24‚Äì14, it was only 20‚Äì14 going into the fourth quarter. Kapp subsequently marched the Vikings 65 yards downfield, completing three passes for 40 yards and going the final 2 yards himself as Minnesota took its first lead of the game, 21‚Äì20, with 8:24 on the clock. Then the Viking defense took over. After their special teams unit tackled returner Ron Smith on the 12-yard line during the ensuing kickoff, Carl Eller sacked Gabriel in the end zone for a safety, giving the Vikings a 23‚Äì20 lead and the ball. But the Rams defense held, and 1969 NFL MVP Gabriel began to march the Rams down field in the last two minutes. As they crossed midfield, it appeared the Rams might get the tying field goal or winning touchdown, but a Gabriel pass was tipped and intercepted at the Viking 40-yard line by Alan Page with 30 seconds left, allowing his team to run out the clock and win.http://fs64sports.blogspot.com/2010/12/1969-kapp-brings-vikings-from- behind-to.html Gabriel completed 22/30 passes for 150 yards and two touchdowns, with 1 interception, while also rushing for 26 yards. Larry Smith was the top rusher of the game with 11 carries for 60 yards, and he caught 6 passes for 36. Kapp completed 12/19 passes for 196 yards with 2 interceptions, while also rushing for 41 yards and a touchdown. Washington caught 4 passes for 90 yards. =Sunday, December 28, 1969= Eastern Conference: Cleveland Browns 38, Dallas Cowboys 14 For the second year in a row, Cleveland eliminated Dallas from the playoffs, this time outgaining them in total yards 344 to 217 and forcing 3 turnovers, without losing any themselves. Cleveland dominated the first half, holding Dallas to just 17 plays and 39 total yards. They had to punt after taking the opening kickoff, but Don Cockroft's high short kick ended up bouncing off the leg of Dallas lineman Rayfield Wright and linebacker Bob Matheson recovered for the Browns on the Cowboys' 34-yard line. Cleveland then drove to their first score on a 2-yard touchdown run by Bo Scott. The Browns later increased their lead to 14‚Äì0 by driving 55 yards to score on Bill Nelsen's 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Milt Morin. Cockroft missed two field goal attempts, but just before the end of the half, Ron Widby's 27-yard punt gave the Browns the ball on the Cowboys' 34-yard line, setting up Cockroft's 29-yard field goal that gave Cleveland a 17‚Äì0 halftime lead. Early in the third quarter, Browns linebacker Jim Houston intercepted Craig Morton's pass and returned it 35 yards to the Dallas 19, leading to Scott's second 2-yard touchdown run to make the score 24‚Äì0. This time Dallas was able to respond, driving 72 yards in 12 plays, including a 26-yard catch by tight end Pettis Norman, to score on Morton's 2-yard touchdown run. However, 24‚Äì7 was as close as the score would get. In the 4th quarter, a 39-yard burst by Browns running back Leroy Kelly (the longest gain of the day for either team) set up his 1-yard touchdown plunge to give the Browns a 31‚Äì7 lead. Dallas had a chance to score after a punt play when Cockroft bobbled a low snap from rookie center Chuck Reynolds and was tackled on the Browns' 22-yard line. But faced with 4th down from the 18 after 7 plays, Morton threw a short pass intended for Walt Garrison that was intercepted by rookie defensive back Walt Sumner, who took off for an 88-yard touchdown return. The only notable thing remaining in the game would be the playoff debut of 27-year old rookie Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach. He got off to a shaky start, throwing an interception that was eliminated by a Browns holding penalty, but managed to lead the Cowboys to a touchdown, rushing three times for 22 yards and completing passes to Lance Rentzel for gains of 14 and 22 yards before finding him in the end zone for a 5-yard scoring pass.http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/12/29/page/64/article/browns- vikings-still-in-clouds Nelsen completed 18/27 passes for 219 yards and a touchdown. His top receiver was Paul Warfield, who caught 8 passes for 99 yards. Kelly had 66 rushing yards, 10 receiving yards, and a touchdown. Morton was held to just 8/24 completions for 92 yards, with two interceptions that were both converted into Cleveland touchdowns. NFL Championship Game: Minnesota Vikings 27, Cleveland Browns 7 Cleveland had lost the previous season's NFL title game 34‚Äì0, and this time fared little better. The Vikings dominated the game, racking up 381 yards without losing a single turnover, while Cleveland gained just 268 yards and turned the ball over three times. The Vikings took a lead just four minutes into the first quarter, driving 70 yards for a touchdown in 8 plays. The key play of the drive was a pass from Joe Kapp to receiver Gene Washington that was nearly 5 yards short of the mark. Despite the short throw, Washington was able to come back and haul it in for a 33-yard gain to the Browns' 24-yard line. Two plays later, Dave Osborn's 12-yard run moved the ball to the 7. Then two plays after that, Bill Brown accidentally slipped and bumped into Kapp while moving up to take a handoff, but Kapp simply kept the ball himself and ran it 7 yards for a touchdown. The situation never got any better for Cleveland. The next time Minnesota got the ball, defensive back Erich Barnes slipped while in one-on-one coverage with Washington, enabling him to catch a pass from Kapp and take off for a 75-yard touchdown completion. Near the end of the first quarter, Browns running back Leroy Kelly lost a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Wally Hilgenberg on the Cleveland 43. Kapp then completed a 12-yard pass to Washington before Fred Cox finished the drive with a 30-yard field goal, putting the Vikings up 17‚Äì0. Later in the second period, Hilgenberg snuffed out a Cleveland scoring threat by intercepting a pass from Bill Nelsen on the Vikings' 33-yard line. Minnesota subsequently drove 67 yards in 8 plays. Kapp started the drive with a pair of completions to John Henderson for 17 total yards, while Osborn broke off a 16-yard run and ended up finishing the drive with a 20-yard touchdown burst, giving the Vikings a 24‚Äì0 lead with 4:46 left in the first half. Cleveland responded with a drive to the Vikings' 17, but turned the ball over on downs when Nelsen overthrew receiver Gary Collins in the end zone on 4th and 3. The third quarter was mostly uneventful, other than Cox's 32-yard field goal that gave Minnesota a 27‚Äì0 lead after an 11-play, 80-yard drive. The most noteworthy play was a 13-yard scramble by Kapp in which he plowed into 240-pound Browns linebacker Jim Houston so hard that Houston was knocked out of the game. In the 4th quarter, Cleveland finally got on the board when a diving 18-yard reception by Paul Warfield set up Nelsen's 3-yard touchdown pass to Collins. There were still 13 minutes on the clock at this point, but there would be no more scoring. The Vikings had a drive to the Cleveland 2-yard line, but decided to let the clock run out instead of going for another score.http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1970/01/05/page/93/article/minnesotans- beat-browns-27-7-1st-title Kapp completed just 7/13 passes, but threw for 169 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 57 yards and another score. Osborn rushed 18 times for 108 yards and a touchdown. Washington had 120 yards and a touchdown on just 3 receptions. Kelly was the Browns' top rusher with 80 yards, while also catching two passes for 17. Nelsen completed just 17 of 33 passes for 181 yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions.

CD-V discs are the same size as a standard 12-cm audio CD, and contain up to 20 minutes' worth of CD Audio that can be played on any audio CD player. It also contains up to 5 minutes of LaserDisc video information with digital CD-quality sound, which can be played back on a newer LaserDisc player capable of playing CD-V discs or CD-V-only players. Description One of the first LaserDisc players that can play CD-V discs is the Pioneer CLD-1010 from 1987. Though it is a CD-based format, CD Video was never given a rainbow book designation; the idea of encoding analogue video, which is incompatible between different regions, was poorly received by CD stakeholders other than Philips, who had not consulted them prior to demonstrating the format to the music industry. CD Video discs have a distinctive gold color, to differentiate them from regular silver-colored audio CDs. This is a characteristic that would later be replicated in HVD, a more advanced disc format. A similar version of CD Video called Video Single Disc (VSD) was also released. It is basically the same as CD Video, but it only has the analog video track (occupying the whole storage space of the disc), so it is in effect a small LaserDisc. CD Video was targeted toward teenagers who watched music videos on MTV. However, few of them were familiar with LaserDiscs, and far fewer owned CDV-compatible players at the time. Buying a costly new player was not an option just for the minor use of playing a single music video more easily accessible through a VHS videocassette, either purchased pre-recorded or recorded off a television programme with a VCR. The term \\"CD Video\\" and its logo were also used on some full-size (8- and 12-inch) LaserDiscs with digital audio (for movies as well as for music titles), to distinguish them from the previous LaserVision format with analog audio and, presumably, to leverage the consumer recognition of the successful CD-Audio format. Though CD Video lasted only a few years in the marketplace and began disappearing by 1991, its legacy would live on with the all-digital MPEG-based Video CD format, which came out a few years later in 1993.

Hwang was born on January 29, 1953 in the Gregorian calendar. However, older Koreans often list their birthdate in the lunisolar Korean calendar, which in this case is December 15, 1952. This date is sometimes repeated in English-language media without specifying that it is in the Korean calendar, causing further confusion when the Gregorian year and Korean calendar month and day are used together to produce an incorrect birthdate of December 15, 1953. Sources specifying a December 15, 1952 birthdate include the Los Angeles Times and Channel News Asia. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (via New York Times) and . The Korea Times states the birthdate is January 29, 1953. is a South Korean veterinarian and researcher. He was a professor of theriogenology and biotechnology at Seoul National University (dismissed on March 20, 2006) who became infamous for fabricating a series of experiments, which appeared in high-profile journals, in the field of stem cell research. Until November 2005, he was considered one of the pioneering experts in the field, best known for two articles published in the journal Science in 2004 and 2005 where he reported he had succeeded in creating human embryonic stem cells by cloning. He was called the \\"Pride of Korea\\" in South Korea. Soon after the first paper was released, however, an article in the journal Nature charged Hwang with having committed ethical violations by using eggs from his graduate students and from the black market. Although he denied the charges at first, Hwang admitted the allegations were true in November 2005. Shortly after that his human cloning experiments were revealed to be fraudulent. On May 12, 2006, Hwang was charged with embezzlement and bioethics law violations after it emerged much of his stem cell research had been faked. The Korea Times reported on June 10, 2007, that Seoul National University fired him, and the South Korean government canceled his financial support and barred him from engaging in stem cell research. While being charged with fraud and embezzlement, he has kept a relatively low profile at the Sooam Bioengineering Research Institute in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, where he currently leads research efforts on creating cloned pig embryos and using them to make embryonic stem-cell lines. Since the controversy subsided, despite the history and his lost credibility as a scientist, Hwang's lab has been actively publishing manuscripts, many of which have appeared on PubMed, the online database for biomedical research. In February 2011, Hwang visited Libya as part of a $133 million project in the North African country to build a stem cell research center and transfer relevant technology. However, the project was canceled due to civil war. Hwang was sentenced to a two years suspended prison sentence at the Seoul Central District Court on 26 October 2009, after being found guilty of embezzlement and bioethical violations but cleared of fraud.Normile, Denis (30 October 2009) Hwang Convicted But Dodges Jail; Stem Cell Research Has Moved On Science Vol. 326. no. 5953, pp. 650 - 651 On this same day, CNN reported that the scientist in 2006 admitted faking his findings, after questions of impropriety had emerged. He had his conviction upheld on 15 December 2010 by an appeals court in South Korea, which resulted in his suspended sentence being reduced by 6 months. In 2014 the South Korean Supreme Court upheld its 2010 ruling. On November 2015, a Chinese biotech company Boyalife Group announced that it will partner with Hwang's laboratory, Sooam Biotech, to open the world's largest animal cloning factory in Tianjin as early as 2016. The factory will aim to produce up to one million cattle embryos per year to meet the increasing demand for quality beef in China. Timeline Hwang first caught media attention in South Korea when he announced he successfully created a cloned dairy cow, Yeongrong-i in February 1999. His alleged success was touted as the fifth instance in the world in cow cloning, with a notable caveat: Hwang failed to provide scientifically verifiable data for the research, giving only media sessions and photo-ops. Hwang's next claim came only two months later in April 1999, when he announced the cloning of a Korean cow, Jin-i, also without providing any scientifically verifiable data. Despite the notable absence of any of the scientific data needed to probe the validity of the research, Hwang's several claims were well received by the South Korean media and public, who were attracted by Hwang's claim of immeasurable economic prospect that his research was said to be promising. The claims of his research results resulted in him receiving the Scientist of the Year Award by the Korea Science Journalists Association. Until 2004, Hwang's main area of research remained in creating genetically modified livestock that included cows and pigs. During that period, Hwang claimed to have created a BSE-resistant cow (which has not been verified) and also stated his intention to clone a Siberian tiger. In February 2004, Hwang and his team announced that they had successfully created an embryonic stem cell with the somatic cell nuclear transfer method, and published their paper in the March 12 issue of Science. Although Hwang had already established himself as an expert in animal cloning and secured celebrity status in South Korea in the late 90s, his alleged sudden success came as a surprise because this was the first reported success in human somatic cell cloning. Until Hwang's claim, it was generally agreed that creating a human stem cell by cloning was next to impossible due to the complexity of primates. Hwang explained that his team used 242 eggs to create a single cell line. In May, Nature magazine published an article stating that Hwang had used eggs taken from two of his graduate students, based on an interview with one of the students. The article raised the question of whether the students might have been pressured to give eggs and thus whether such a donation would have been \\"voluntary\\" as Hwang claimed in his scientific paper. At that time, Hwang denied that he had used his students' eggs. Hwang's team announced an even greater achievement a year later in May 2005, and claimed they had created 11 human embryonic stem cells using 185 eggs. His work, published in the June 17 issue of Science, was instantly hailed as a breakthrough in biotechnology because the cells were allegedly created with somatic cells from patients of different age and gender, while the stem cell of 2004 was created with eggs and somatic cells from a single female donor. This meant every patient could receive custom-made treatment with no immune reactions. In addition, Hwang's claim meant that his team had boosted their success rate by 14 times and that this technology could be medically viable. Hwang made further headlines in May 2005 when he criticized U.S. President George W. Bush's policy on embryonic stem cell research. Also, Time magazine named Hwang one of its \\"People Who Mattered 2004\\", stating that Hwang \\"has already proved that human cloning is no longer science fiction, but a fact of life.\\" Following on the earlier success, on August 3, 2005, Hwang announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully clone a dog, which has been independently verified through genetic testing. The dog, an Afghan Hound, was named Snuppy. Shortly after his groundbreaking 2005 work, Hwang was appointed to head the new World Stem Cell Hub, a facility that was to be the world's leading stem cell research centre. However, in November 2005, Gerald Schatten, a University of Pittsburgh researcher who had worked with Hwang for two years, made the surprise announcement that he had ceased his collaboration with Hwang. In an interview, Schatten commented that \\"my decision is grounded solely on concerns regarding oocyte (egg) donations in Hwang's research reported in 2004.\\" Following an intense media probe, Roh Sung-il, one of Hwang's close collaborators and head of MizMedi Women's Hospital, held a news conference on November 21. During the conference Roh admitted that he had paid women US$1,400 each for donating their eggs, eggs that were later used in Hwang's research. However, Roh claimed Hwang was unaware of this, while the South Korean Ministry of Health assured that no laws or ethical guidelines had been breached as there were no commercial interests involved in this payout. Hwang maintained that he was unaware that these actions were happening during the research and he resigned from his post. On November 22, PD Su-cheop (PD Notebook), a popular MBC investigative reporting show, raised the possibility of unethical conduct in the egg cell acquiring process. Despite the factual accuracy of the report, news media as well as people caught up in nationalistic fervor in their unwavering support for Hwang asserted that criticism of Hwang's work was \\"unpatriotic\\", so much so that the major companies who were sponsoring the show immediately withdrew their support. On November 24, Hwang held a press conference in Seoul, in which he declared his intention of resigning from most of his official posts. He also apologized for his actions. In the interview he said, \\"I was blinded by work and my drive for achievement.\\" He denied coercing his researchers into donating eggs and claimed that he found out about the situation only after it had occurred. He added that he had lied about the source of the eggs donated to protect the privacy of his female researchers, and that he was not aware of the Declaration of Helsinki, which clearly enumerates his actions as a breach of ethical conduct. After the press conference, which was aired on all major South Korean television networks, most of the nation's media outlets, government ministries, and the public gave support to Hwang. Sympathy for Hwang poured out, resulting in an increase in the number of women who wanted to donate their eggs for Hwang's research. On December 29, 2005, the university determined that all 11 of Hwang's stem cell lines were fabricated. The university announced on January 10, 2006, that Hwang's 2004 and 2005 papers on Science were both fabricated. Following on the confirmation of scientific misconduct, on January 11, Science retracted both of Hwang's papers on unconditional terms. On January 12, 2006, Hwang held a press conference to apologize for the entire fiasco, but still did not admit to cheating. Instead, he explicitly put the blame on other members of his research project for having deceived him with false data and alleged a conspiracy, saying that his projects had been sabotaged and that there was theft of materials involved. He said that cloning human stem cells was possible and that he had the technology to do it, and if he were given six more months he could prove it. This is an extension of the ten days he said he needed to re-create the stem cells that he asked for back on December 16, 2005. Seoul prosecutors raided his home that day for files and evidence, to start a criminal investigation of Hwang. On January 20, 2006, Hwang maintained that two of his 11 forged stem cell lines had been maliciously switched for cells from regular, not cloned, embryos. The allegation involves the lines Hwang claims to have created at Seoul-based MizMedi Hospital. In November 22, 2016 Hwang received a certificate of patent on NT-1 technology by the Korean Intellectual Property Office. Hwang's laboratory technique Somatic cell nuclear transfer can create clones for both reproductive and therapeutic purposes. The diagram depicts the removal of the donor nucleus for schematic purposes; in practice the whole donor cell is transferred. In the late 1990s, the method that scientists used in cloning was somatic cell nuclear transfer, which is the same procedure that was used to create Dolly the sheep. This laboratory technique begins when an egg is taken from a donor and the nucleus is removed from the egg, creating an enucleated egg. A cell, which contains DNA, is then taken from the animal being cloned. The enucleated egg is then fused together with the nucleus of the cloning subject's cell using electricity. This creates an embryo, which is implanted into a surrogate mother through in vitro fertilization. If the procedure is successful, then the surrogate mother will give birth to a baby that is a clone of the cloning subject at the end of a normal gestation period. In 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of tenShukman, David (14 January 2014) China cloning on an 'industrial scale' BBC News Science and Environment, Retrieved 10 April 2014 but in 1996 it took 277 attempts to create Dolly. Hwang allegedly used this technique at his laboratory in SNU to clone dogs during his experiments throughout the early 2000s. He claimed that it was possible to clone mammals and that probability for success can be better than 1 in 277 attempts (as in similar cases such as Dolly). Hwang was the first in the world to clone a dog, an Afghan hound called Snuppy in 2005. He described his procedure for cloning in the journal Nature. Researchers from the Seoul National University and the US National Institutes of Health confirmed that Snuppy was a clone. Since then Hwang and his associates have cloned many more dogs.(24 April 2008) South Korea Training Cloned Sniffer Dogs to Track Down Drugs, Explosives Fox News, Retrieved 10 April 2014Whipple, Tom (10 April 2014) Mini Winnie, UK‚Äôs first cloned pup The Times, Retrieved 10 April 2014 In 2015, it was reported that Huang Woo-suk's company Sooam Biotech had produced 700 cloned puppies since 2005 with their owners paying about $100,000 each to have their dogs cloned. Hwang's intention to develop better technique for cloning was focused on stem cells because they are still at an early stage of development and retain the potential to turn into many different types of cell and when they divide, each new cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or become another type of cell with a more specialized function. According to stem cell biologists, it might be possible to harness this ability to turn stem cells into a super \\"repair kit\\" for the body, theoretically to use stem cells to generate healthy tissue to replace that either damaged by trauma or compromised by disease. The many conditions and illnesses that may eventually be treated by stem cell therapy include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, diabetes, burns, and spinal cord damage. In March 2012, it was announced that Hwang would collaborate with Russian scientists in an attempt to clone a woolly mammoth from remains found in Siberia. He had previously successful cloned eight coyotes in March 2011 using domestic dogs as surrogate mothers and grey wolves. However finding a mammoth sample fit for cloning has been unsuccessful as of 2015.\\"–ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—Å—è –º–∞–º–æ–Ω—Ç—ã\\" February 5, 2015 (retrieved September 6, 2015) In 2015, the Chinese company BoyaLife announced that in partnership with the Hwang Woo-suk's company Sooam Biotech, they were planning to build a 200 million RMB (about US$32 million) factory in Tianjin, China to produce 100,000 cloned cattle per year, starting in 2016 to supply China's growing market for quality beef. In 2015, Sooam Biotech cloned a male boxer puppy from a pet dog that had been dead for 12 days. This was the first time they had cloned a dog that had been dead for such a long time. In 2016, Hwang's company was regularly cloning pigs which were genetically predisposed to certain diseases so that they could be used for testing pharmaceuticals and cloning cattle which were highly valued for their meat. In total Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing roughly 500 cloned embryos a day from various species. They were also reported to be attempting to clone the Ethiopian wolf, one of the world's rarest canids, of which there are only 500 in the wild, another endangered canid, the Dhole, of which there only about 2,500 adults and the Siberian musk deer which is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. Controversies Until late November 2005, Hwang was criticized only for unpublicized ethical violations. Colleagues and media outlets asserted that he had paid female donors for egg donations and that he had received donations from two junior researchers, both of which were violations. Later controversies would center around scientific misconduct. His team, which cloned the first human embryo to use for research, said they had used the same technology to create batches of embryonic stem cells from nine patients. According to Hwang, the result was much more efficient than they had hoped. Hwang's integrity as a researcher was again put in doubt when it was revealed that PD Su-cheop scheduled a follow-up report questioning his achievement published in Science in June 2005, which stated he had cloned 11 lines of embryonic stem cells. This caused furious backlash among many South Koreans, and the reaction only intensified when it was discovered that Kim Sun-Jong, one of Hwang's researchers from MizMedi, was coerced by illegal means to testify against Hwang. As a result, the scheduled broadcast was canceled and the network even made a public apology to the nation, everyone more or less operating under the assumption that the show was at fault and not Hwang. Yet, other news outlets began to question Hwang's claims. Close scrutiny revealed that several of the photos of purportedly different cells were in fact photos of the same cell. Hwang responded that these additional photos were accidentally included and that there was no such duplication in the original submission to Science. This was later confirmed by the journal. Researchers raised questions about striking similarities between the DNA profiles of the cloned cells. Then collaborator Gerald Schatten asked Science to remove his name from the paper, stating as a reason that there were \\"allegations from someone involved with the experiments that certain elements of the report may be fabricated.\\" In the midst of national confusion, Hwang disappeared from public sight, to be hospitalized days later for alleged stress-related fatigue, while public opinion gradually began to turn against Hwang with even the major Korean companies who pulled their support from \\"PD Su-Cheop\\" reportedly now less than pleased with Hwang. Days later, Hwang started going to his laboratory while requesting Seoul National University to officially conduct a probe to the allegations surrounding him. The scandal took a dramatic turn on December 15, when Roh Sung-il, who collaborated on that paper, stated to media outlets that nine of those eleven lines had been faked; specifically, DNA tests illustrated that those nine lines shared identical DNA, implying that they had come from the same source. Roh stated that \\"Professor Hwang admitted to fabrication\\", and that he, Hwang, and another co- author had asked Science to withdraw the paper. Adding fuel to the fire, MBC broadcast the content of the canceled PD Su-cheop show, which substantiated Roh's claim. On the same day, The Seattle Times reported that Science had not yet received an official request from Hwang to withdraw the paper, and it had refused to remove Schatten's name from the paper, stating, \\"No single author, having declared at the time of submission his full and complete confidence in the contents of the paper, can retract his name unilaterally, after publication.\\" Several prominent scientists, including Ian Wilmut, who cloned Dolly the sheep in 1996, and Bob Lanza, a cloning expert based in Worcester, Massachusetts, did call on Hwang to submit his paper to an outside group for independent analysis. Lanza noted, \\"You can't fake the results if they're carried out by an independent group. I think this simple test could put the charges to rest.\\" Two major press conferences were held on Korean networks on December 16, one with Hwang followed by the other with his former colleague, Roh Sung-il. Hwang started his press conference by claiming that the technology to make stem cells exists, which is not an explicit statement that the stem cell lines he featured in his paper to Science were not fakes. He, however, acknowledged the falsifications of research data in the paper, attributing them to unrecoverable \\"artificial mistakes.\\" He said that there was a problem with the original lines caused by contamination, and if he were given ten more days he could re-create the stem cell lines. He accused Dr. Kim Sun-Jong, a former collaborator, of \\"switching\\" some of the stem cell lines. Despite Hwang's claim, in another press conference held only minutes later, Roh Sung-il rebutted Hwang's accusation, saying Hwang was blackmailing MizMedi and Kim Sun-jong. He maintained that at least nine of the eleven stem cell lines were fakes and that Hwang is simply untrustworthy. \\"Roh Sung-il, chairman of the board at Mizmedi Hospital, told KBS television that Hwang had agreed to ask the journal Science to withdraw the paper, published in June to international acclaim. Roh was one of the co-authors of the article that detailed how individual stem cell colonies were created for 11 patients through cloning. Roh also told MBC television that Hwang had pressured a former scientist at his lab to fake data to make it look like there were 11 stem cell colonies. In a separate report, a former researcher told MBC that Hwang ordered him to fabricate photos to make it appear there were 11 separate colonies from only three. [...] University of Pittsburgh researcher Gerald Schatten has already asked that Science remove him as the senior author of the report, citing questions about the paper's accuracy. Seoul National University announced this week it would conduct an internal probe into Hwang's research.\\" Some scientists have started questioning Hwang's earlier work published in Science in February 2004 in which he claimed to have cloned embryonic stem cells. Maria Biotech head Park Se-pill said, \\"Up until now, I have believed Hwang did derive cloned embryonic stem cells although he admitted to misconduct in his follow-up paper on patient-specific stem cells...Now, I am not sure whether the cloned stem cell really existed.\\" On July 26, 2006, Hwang said in testimony that he spent part of 500 million won in private donations in attempts to clone extinct Russian mammoths and Korean tigers. =Official probe by Seoul National University and the confirmation of fraud= An internal panel was set up in Seoul National University to investigate the allegation, and the probe was started on December 17, 2005. The panel sealed off Hwang's laboratory and conducted a thorough investigation, collecting testimonies from Hwang, Roh and other people that were involved with the scandal. On December 23, the panel announced its initial finding that Hwang had intentionally fabricated stem cell research results creating nine fake cell lines out of eleven, and added that the validity of two remaining cell lines is yet to be confirmed. The panel stated that Hwang's misconduct is \\"a grave act damaging the foundation of science.\\" Hwang's claim of having used only 185 eggs to create stem cell lines was also denied by the panel, which indicated that more eggs may have been used in the research process. The panel announced additional findings on December 29, and confirmed that there are no patient-matched embryonic stem cells in existence and that Hwang's team doesn't have the scientific data to prove any of the stem cells have ever been made. In its final report published on January 10, 2006, the panel reaffirmed its previous findings while announcing additional discoveries. The panel found out that, contrary to Hwang's claim of having used 185 eggs for his team's 2005 paper, at least 273 eggs were shown to have been used according to research records kept in Hwang's lab. In addition, the panel discovered that Hwang's team was supplied with 2,061 eggs in the period of November 28, 2002 to December 8, 2005. Hwang's claim of not having known about the donation of eggs by his own female researchers was also denied by the panel; in fact, it was discovered that Hwang himself had distributed egg donation consent forms to his researchers and personally escorted one to the MizMedi Hospital to perform the egg extraction procedure. The panel stated that Hwang's 2004 Science paper was also fabricated and decided the stem cell discussed in the paper may have been generated by a case of parthenogenetic process (which is itself a significant development, as mammals rarely reproduce by parthenogenesis; in addition, this would make Hwang's lab the first ever to successfully generate human stem cells via parthenogenesis, predating other research facilities' successes).Minkel, JR. \\"Korean Cloned Human Cells Were Product of 'Virgin Birth.' Scientific American, 2007 August. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/korean-cloned-human-cells/ Although Hwang's team didn't rule out the possibility of parthenogenetic process in the paper, the panel said, his team didn't make any conscientious effort to probe the possibility through the tests available. Chung Myunghee, the head of the panel, said at a news conference that the panel is not in a position to investigate Hwang's claim of his stem cells having been switched with MizMedi's, but added that such a claim is incomprehensible when there is no data to prove any of the stem cells were ever made to begin with. The panel, in conclusion, stated that Hwang's team intentionally fabricated the data in both the 2004 and the 2005 papers and that it is \\"an act of deception targeted to both scientific community and general public.\\" However, the panel confirmed that Hwang's team actually succeeded in cloning a dog they named Snuppy. (See also Nature 439:122-123) =Hwang's announcement of resignation and the official dismissal= On December 23, 2005 Hwang apologized for \\"creating a shock and a disappointment\\" and announced that he was resigning his position as professor at the university. However, Hwang maintained that patient-matched stem cell technology remains in South Korea, and his countrymen shall see it. Seoul National University said Hwang's resignation request will not be accepted, citing a university regulation that dictates an employee under investigation may not resign from a post. This regulation is effected to prevent premature resignations by investigated employees, which would allow them to avoid full retributions according to the findings of the investigation (and perhaps avoid involuntary termination), while reaping the benefits of the more honorable and lucrative voluntary resignation. On February 9, 2006, the university suspended Hwang's position as the university's professor, together with six other faculty members who participated in Hwang's team. Subsequently, Hwang was dismissed from the university on March 20, 2006. =The indictment of Hwang and five of his collaborators= On May 12, 2006, Hwang was indicted on charges of fraud, embezzlement and breach of the country's bioethics law, without physical detention. Prosecutors also brought fraud charges against the three stem cell researchers. He embezzled 2.8 billion won ($3 million) out of some 40 billion won in research funds for personal purposes and the illegal purchase of ova used in his experiments. The prosecution also said Hwang's three associates involved in his stem cell research, Yoon Hyun-soo, Lee Byeong-chun and Kang Sung-keun, also misappropriated tens of millions of won in research money. Investigators have been tracking 24.6 billion won to find out how the research money was spent. It was part of Hwang's 36.9 billion won research funds raised through state support and private donations. Investigators said Hwang used bank accounts held by relatives and subordinates in 2002 and 2003 to receive about 475 million won from private organizations. He allegedly laundered the money by withdrawing it all in cash, breaking it up into smaller amounts and putting it back in various bank accounts. Hwang also withdrew 140 million won in August 2001 to buy gifts for his sponsors, including politicians and other prominent social figures, before Chusok holidays, according to prosecutors. He also allegedly misappropriated around 26 million won in research funds in September 2004 to buy a car for his wife. Hwang is suspected of embezzling 600 million won, provided by a private foundation, on multiple occasions from 2001 to 2005 for personal use. Prosecutors are also accusing him of illegally paying some 38 million won to 25 women who provided ova for his research through Hanna Women's Clinic in the first eight months of 2005. They also said Hwang gave several dozen politicians about 55 million won in political funds on numerous occasions from 2001 to 2005. He allegedly provided 14 million won to executives of large companies that provided financial support for his research. The prosecution added Hwang wired about 200 million won to a Korean American, identified only as Kang, in September 2005 and received the equivalent amount in U.S. currency from him when the scientist visited the United States two months later. Also in 2005, Hwang received one billion won each in research funds from SK Group and the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation based on his fabricated stem cell research results. Meanwhile, investigators said Lee Byeong-chun and Kang Sung-keun, both professors of veterinary science at Seoul National University, embezzled about 300 million won and 100 million won each in state funds by inflating research-related expenses. Yoon Hyun-soo, a biology professor at Hanyang University, also embezzled 58 million won from the research fund managed by MizMedi Hospital. Parthenogenesis On August 2, 2007, after much independent investigation, it was revealed that Hwang's team succeeded in extracting cells from eggs that had undergone parthenogenesis. Hwang claimed he and his team had extracted stem cells from cloned human embryos. However, further examination of the cells' chromosomes shows the same indicators of parthenogenesis in those extracted stem cells as are found in the mice created by Tokyo scientists in 2004. Although Hwang deceived the world about being the first to create artificially cloned human embryos, he did contribute a major breakthrough to the field of stem cell research. The process may offer a way for creating stem cells that are genetically matched to a particular woman for the treatment of degenerative diseases. The news of the breakthrough came just a month after an announcement from the International Stem Cell Corporation (ISC), a California-based stem cell research company, that they had successfully created the first human embryos through parthenogenesis. Although the actual results of Hwang's work were just published, those embryos were created by him and his team before February 2004, when the fabricated cloning results were announced, which would make them the first to successfully perform the process. Jeffrey Janus, president and director of research for ISC, agrees that \\"Dr. Hwang's cells have characteristics found in parthenogenetic cells\\" but remains cautious, saying \\"it needs more study.\\" South Korea's response to controversies =South Korean government's involvement in the scandal= After having acquired a celebrity status in South Korea, Hwang actively sought to establish every possible tie to political and economic institutions in the country. Hwang especially tried to win favor from the Roh Moo-hyun government, which in turn was suffering from a lack of popular support and wanted to demonstrate its competency by creating and promoting an exemplary policy success. Hwang approached Park Ki-young, a former biology professor, then appointed as the Information, Science and Technology Advisor for the President, and put her as one of the co-authors in his 2004 Science paper. Ties with Park yielded a favorable environment for Hwang in the government, as a non-official group consisting of high-ranking government officials was created to support Hwang's research that includes not only Hwang and Park, but also Kim Byung-joon, Chief National Policy Secretary, and Jin Dae-je, Information and Communications Minister. The group was dubbed as \\"Hwang-kum-pak-chui\\", a loose acronym made from each member's family names, which means \\"golden bat\\" in Korean. After Hwang's paper was published in Science in 2005, support for Hwang came in full swing. In June 2005, the Ministry of Science and Technology selected Hwang as the first recipient of the title Supreme Scientist, an honor worth US$15 million.‚ÄòÏ†ú1Ìò∏ ÏµúÍ≥†Í≥ºÌïôÏûê‚ÄôÏóê Ìô©Ïö∞ÏÑù ÍµêÏàò : Í≥ºÌïô : ITÍ≥ºÌïô : Ïù∏ÌÑ∞ÎÑ∑ÌïúÍ≤®Î†à Hwang, having already claimed the title of POSCO Chair Professor worth US$1.5 million, secured more than US$27 million worth of support in that year.Ï†ïÎ∂Ä 98ÎÖÑ Ïù¥ÌõÑ Ìô©Ïö∞ÏÑù ÏßÄÏõêÍ∏à 658ÏñµÏõê - Ï°∞ÏÑ†Îã∑Ïª¥ President Roh had been acquainted with Hwang since 2003, and made a number of comments intended to protect Hwang from potential bioethical issues. On June 18, 2004, Roh awarded Hwang a medal and said, \\"it is not possible nor desirable to prohibit research, just because there are concerns that it may lead to a direction that is deemed unethical.\\" In another instance at the opening of World Stem Cell Hub on October 19, 2005, Roh remarked, \\"politicians have a responsibility to manage bioethical controversies not to get in the way of this outstanding research and progress.\\"'Ìô©Ïö∞ÏÑù Í¥ëÌíç', 'ÎÖ∏ ÎåÄÌÜµÎ†πÏùò ÏûÖ'Ïù¥ ÏûêÏ¥àÌïú ÏùºÏù¥Îã§ ÌîÑÎ†àÏãúÏïà On December 5, 2005, after PD Su-cheop stirred a national controversy, Cheong Wa Dae reaffirmed its unflinching support for Hwang and his research team. Roh said, \\"We'll continue to support Professor Hwang. We hope he will return to his research lab soon for the sake of people with physical difficulties and the public\\", according to presidential spokesman Kim Man-soo. While implying the controversies over MBC-TV's forceful methods used to gather information from Hwang's former junior staff members, Roh said, \\"The disputes will be resolved gradually and naturally through following scientific research and study. We hope the ongoing disputes over Hwang's achievement will be settled without further trouble.\\" It was alleged that advisor Park Ki-young deliberately avoided to report Roh about details of Hwang's allegation for misconduct, while emphasizing a breach of journalist ethics by MBC. Park, after weeks of silence for her role in the controversy, announced her intent to resign from the advisor post on January 10, 2006. On January 11, 2006, the national post office stopped selling post stamps commemorating Hwang's research. The title of Supreme Scientist awarded to Hwang was revoked on March 21, 2006, after Hwang was dismissed from Seoul National University the day before. =Lawmakers‚Äô group supporting Professor Hwang Woo-suk= On December 6, 2005 a group of 43 lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties inaugurated a body to support Hwang Woo-suk. Members of the group, dubbed the \\"lawmakers' group supporting Professor Hwang Woo-suk\\", pledged to help Hwang continue his experiments in pursuit of a scientific breakthrough. \\"There are many lawmakers who, regardless of party affiliation, want to support Hwang. We will join forces to help Hwang devote himself to his studies\\", Rep. Kwon Sun- taik of the ruling Uri Party said in a news conference at the National Assembly, who was also the leader of the group. He said the group will seek to establish bioethics guidelines and come up with supporting measures for biotechnology researchers in the country. Among those who have joined the group were Reps. Kim Hyuk-kyu, Kim Young-choon and Kim Sung-gon of the ruling party, Kim Hyong-o of the main opposition Grand National Party (GNP) and Kim Hak-won, chairman of the United Liberal Democrats. Some female lawmakers participated in a civic group for voluntary egg donations for therapeutic research, which opened in November 2005 following the egg procurement scandal. Reps. Song Young-sun and Chin Soo-hee of the GNP said they would provide their eggs to Hwang's research team. Meanwhile, the ruling and opposition parties called on the Korean Broadcasting Commission to thoroughly investigate the staffers of MBCs PD Notebook, which broadcast a documentary program critical of Hwang with coercive tactics in interviews, and reprimand them.Page Error : Ï∞æÏúºÏãúÎäî PageÏùò URLÏù¥ ÏûòÎ™ªÎêòÏóàÍ±∞ÎÇò ÏóÜÏäµÎãàÎã§ After most of Hwang's claims were confirmed fake on January 10, 2006, some lawmakers revealed that Hwang made several campaign donations to them and other lawmakers.Ìô©Ïö∞ÏÑù ‚ÄòÏ†ïÏπò ÌõÑÏõêÍ∏à‚Äô‚Ä¶Ï†ïÍ≥Ñ ‚ÄòÍ∏¥Ïû•‚Äô : Ï†ïÏπòÏùºÎ∞ò : Ï†ïÏπò : Îâ¥Ïä§ : ÌïúÍ≤®Î†à =Return of PD Notebook to the air in 2006= The investigative journalism show MBC PD Notebook (Korean: PDÏàòÏ≤©) returned on air on January 3, 2006, and summarized the course of Hwang's scandal to date. The show had been cancelled under pressure after it aired its show on November 22 that accused Hwang of oddities in his research. The last show in 2005, aired on November 29, covered other topics. It remained off the air for five weeks. The second show in 2006, on January 10, dealt further with the Hwang affair, focusing on several instances of Hwang's media spinning tactics. It also covered the unwillingness on the part of a significant part of the public in South Korea to believe that someone who had almost achieved a status of a national hero committed such a shame. =Rallies supporting Hwang= The same day many South Korean citizens rallied outside Hwang's laboratory; as more than 1,000 women pledged to donate their eggs for the scientist's research. [ ... ] Hwang has been in seclusion since apologizing in November 2005, for ethical lapses in human egg procurement for his research. The symbolic event was as a gesture from Hwang's supporters that says they intend to donate their eggs with 1,000 of their members after they took egg-donation pledges online via their website. \\"Dr. Hwang will not be able to return to the lab, at least, until at the end of this week because he is extremely exhausted, mentally and physically\\", a key team member, Ahn Cu Rie, wrote in an e-mail to Reuters. [ ... ] At Hwang's lab at Seoul National University, women left bouquets of the national flower, a hibiscus called the Rose of Sharon, for the scientist along with notes of encouragement. The stem cell research center that Hwang led before resigning said it hoped he would return, even though his lapses could hurt its efforts to work with other research institutions. \\"So far more than 700 South Korean women have pledged to donate their eggs and the number is steadily rising\\", said Lee Sun-min, an official at a private foundation launched last week to promote egg donations. [ ... ] Thousands of patients have applied to participate in the research, hoping the technology could help treat damaged spinal cords or diseases such as Parkinson's. On Tuesday, an official at the lab said it was hoped that Hwang would return. \\"We're waiting for Hwang to assume the leadership after some rest\\", Seong Myong-hoon told a news conference. But Seong said the controversy could hurt the lab. That conclusion was reached after one of Hwang's close research partners, Ahn Cu- rie, returned Tuesday after a 10-day trip to meet with scientists in the United States and Japan, Seong said. \\"The reaction of foreign scientists was that they understand what Dr. Hwang disclosed, but they cannot accept that without criticism\\", Seong said. \\"We can never be optimistic about cooperation with foreign institutions.\\" Seong added: \\"Researchers of our country were newly awakened to the fact that we have to take every precaution to ensure we don't fall behind international ethics (guidelines) while researching.\\" \\"The only hope for us is Dr. Hwang. Don't trample on our one shred of hope\\", a woman whose son suffers from a severe kidney ailment told South Korean broadcaster YTN at the university. The woman also pledged to sell her eggs to Hwang. =Online ova donations= A website backed by Hwang's supporters began taking egg-donation pledges online since late November 2005 after Hwang resigned all his official posts at World Stem Cell Hub, relaying them to a clinic linked to Hwang's research team. The number of pledges had reached 725 by early December 2005. Banners like \\"Please come back, Doctor Hwang. I'm already dying to see you, Professor Hwang\\", were put up on the homepage.Daum - Ïπ¥Ìéò The site also carried a photo of Hwang and his cloned dog, Snuppy, trimmed with images of the rose of sharon, South Korea's national flower, in an apparent appeal for patriotism. The national anthem played as background music. Those who applied to donate ova included those with incurable illnesses or their family members, who hope that Hwang's research will eventually lead to cures, as well as just ordinary young, healthy women.

It is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. The college offers English as a second language and General Educational Development (GED) prep classes, the Running Start program, and many associate degrees (transfer, associate of applied science, associate of arts) and Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degrees. History Columbia Basin College has served Benton and Franklin counties for nearly 60 years. The first classes at CBC were authorized by the State Board of Education in May 1955. Classes began in September, 1955 in temporary quarters at the former Pasco Naval Airbase. The Pasco School District received title to more than of land for the present campus site in Pasco. CBC's first permanent building was completed in 1957 and was the V building which was replaced in 2011 by the Center for Career and Technical Education (CTE). The Community College Act of 1967 separated the College from the Pasco School District and CBC became the 19th community college district in the state of Washington. CBC continually expands and renovates programs which now includes Bachelor of Applied Science degrees. The enrollment of the College has grown from 299 students in 1955 to more than 8,000 students per quarter today. The faculty includes 140 full-time instructors and 300 part-time instructors. Campus Buildings on the Columbia Basin College campus Health Science Center The Pasco campus has seen substantial growth in the past decade, adding new facilities to accommodate the large demand for higher education from a growing community. Standout facilities include the Arts Center (P building), Lee R. Thornton Center for Science, Technology, and Diversity; Bechtel National Planetarium; Robert & Elisabeth Moore Observatory; the Center for Career and Technical Education (CTE); and a research farm. Recent infrastructure improvements include substantial remodels to the Hawk Union Building (HUB), Business building, the Library, the Science building, the Administration building, the Fitness Center, the athletic fields, and the I-Complex. The CBC Health Science Center is located in Richland, Washington, approximately 10 miles from the main campus. The four-story building was built in 2006 to house CBC's Health Sciences programs.

These telescopes formed an astronomical interferometer where all the signals are combined in a purpose-built computer (a correlator) to produce high-resolution astronomical images.Douglas Bock and the CARMA Team, Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy, From Planets to Dark Energy: the Modern Radio Universe, October 1-5 2007, The University of Manchester, UK The telescopes ceased operation in April 2015 and were relocated to the Owens Valley Radio Observatory for storage. The Atacama Large Millimeter Array in Chile has succeeded CARMA as the most powerful millimeter wave interferometer in the world.  Location  According to the CARMA observatory catalog, the median height of all telescope pads was at an elevation of . The observatory was located in the Inyo Mountains to the east of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, at a site called Cedar Flat, accessed through Westgard Pass. The high elevation site was chosen to minimize millimeter wave absorption and phase decoherence by atmospheric water vapor.  Features  This array was unique for being a heterogeneous collection of radio telescopes of varying sizes and design. There were three types of telescopes, all Cassegrain reflector antennas with parabolic primary mirrors and hyperbolic secondary mirrors: * Six telescopes each in diameter. These were part of the Millimeter Array at the OVRO site operated by Caltech. They were moved to Cedar Flat in the Spring of 2005. * Nine telescopes each in diameter. These were formerly located at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory and operated by the Berkeley- Illinois-Maryland-Association (BIMA) consortium. These were moved from HCRO in the spring of 2005 to Cedar Flat. * Eight telescopes each in diameter. These were built as an instrument for cosmology and are also known as the Sunyaev- Zel'dovich Array (SZA), a project led by John Carlstrom at the University of Chicago. The SZA spent three years on the valley floor at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory observing the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy clusters. In the summer of 2008 it was moved up to Cedar Flat.  Deployment  , the six telescopes from the OVRO array and the nine telescopes from the BIMA array were working together to gather scientific data. Pioneering work on compensating for the image distortion resulting from turbulent water vapor distributions in the troposphere started in the fall of 2008. The most extended configurations of the array, up to , were required for viewing the finest details in astronomical images. Over these distances the variation in the time of arrival of signals at the different telescopes as they pass through different amounts of water vapor severely limits the quality of images. By siting an SZA antenna near each of the CARMA antennas and observing a compact astronomical radio source near the source under study, the properties of the atmosphere could be measured on time scales as short as a couple of seconds. This information could be used in the data reduction process to remove a significant fraction of the degradation caused by the atmospheric scintillation. Observations using the SZA (operating at 30 GHz) to make the atmospheric measurements started in November 2008. The SZA has also participated directly in the science operations of CARMA during experiments where all three types of telescopes were attached to the same correlator. Observations were primarily in the 3 mm range (80‚Äì115 GHz) and the 1 mm range (210‚Äì270 GHz). These frequencies are useful for detecting many molecular gases, including the second most abundant molecule in the universe, carbon monoxide (CO). Observing CO is an indirect indicator of the presence of molecular hydrogen gas (the most abundant molecule in the universe) which is difficult to detect directly. Cold dust is also detectable in this wavelength range and can be used to study planet-forming disks around stars, for example. In 2009, the OVRO 10.4 m antennas were instrumented with 27‚Äì35 GHz receivers and made observations in the centimeter band in concert with the SZA antennas.  Universities involved  CARMA was a consortium composed of three primary groups.

The mountain's upper reaches are located in the alpine zone, an area where only dwarf vegetation exists due to the harsh climate. The mountain Mount Lafayette from Mount Lincoln Mount Lafayette is the highest point in the Franconia Range, a line of peaks along the east side of Franconia Notch. It is the sixth highest peak in New Hampshire and the highest outside of the Presidential Range. It is the second most prominent peak in the state. On the western side, its lower slopes lie inside Franconia Notch State Park. The remainder of the mountain lies within the White Mountain National Forest. The summit marks the western border of the Pemigewasset Wilderness Area within the WMNF. =Trails= A variety of trails lead up over 3,000 vertical feet (900 m) to its exposed summit. The Greenleaf Trail begins at the parking lot for the Cannon Mountain tramway and ascends to the Appalachian Mountain Club's Greenleaf Hut, then continues to the summit. The Bridle Path trail follows a western spur ridge of Lafayette from Lafayette Place Campground on Interstate 93 past Greenleaf Hut and joins the Greenleaf Trail, reaching the summit after the hut. The peak is at the junction of the Garfield Ridge Trail, which follows the ridge northeast to Mount Garfield, and the Franconia Ridge Trail, which leads south to Mounts Lincoln, Liberty, and Flume. Both the Garfield Ridge Trail and the Franconia Ridge Trail form part of the Appalachian Trail. Thomas Hill, 1870 A very popular hike is to make a loop combining the three most notable summits of the Franconia Range. The loop starts with the Old Bridle Path to the AMC Greenleaf Hut. From there, one takes the Greenleaf Trail to the summit of Mt. Lafayette. Turning south along the Franconia Ridge Trail, one passes over Mount Lincoln and Little Haystack, then descends via the Falling Waters Trail, which connects back with the beginning of the Old Bridle Path. This loop is long, with a cumulative elevation gain of about .

Tournament bracket Within each conference, the two division winners qualified for the playoffs. In the start round, the Capitol and Century division winners played in the Eastern Conference Game, while the Coastal and Central division winners were in the Western Conference game. The winners of the two conference games advanced to the NFL Championship Game to compete for the NFL league title and the right to face the American Football League champion in the Super Bowl. The losers of the conference championship games played in the Playoff Bowl, a third place game held at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. Prior to , the playoff sites rotated and were known prior to the start of the season. In 1968, the hosts were the Century and Coastal division winners for the conference championships (first round), and the Eastern Conference for the championship game. This effectively gave home field advantage to the Century Division winner, the Cleveland Browns (10‚Äì4). The 1967 and 1969 playoff hosts were Capitol, Central, and Western, respectively. The rotation system forced the 12-2 Cowboys, champions of the Capitol Division, to play at the 10-4 Browns in the Eastern Conference playoff. It had no effect in the Western Conference, where the 13-1 Colts hosted the 8-6 Vikings. Conference championships =Saturday, December 21, 1968= Eastern Conference: Cleveland Browns 31, Dallas Cowboys 20 Despite the game's high score, this was actually a defensive struggle as both teams took advantage of each other's turnovers throughout the game. However, Cleveland emerged triumphant, overcoming a 10‚Äì3 first half deficit with 21 unanswered points. Early in the first quarter, Browns defensive back Mike Howell intercepted a pass from Don Meredith and returned it 20 yards to set up Don Cockroft's 38-yard field goal. Dallas took the lead later on, when linebacker Chuck Howley forced a fumble while sacking Browns quarterback Bill Nelsen and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Dallas increased their lead to 10‚Äì3 when an interception by Cowboys linebacker Dave Edwards led to Mike Clark's 16-yard field goal. However, the Browns tied the game with a last minute drive at the end of the half, moving the ball 85 yards in 4 plays and scoring on Nelsen's 45-yard touchdown pass to running back Leroy Kelly. The Browns broke the game open on the first play of the second half when linebacker Dale Lindsey intercepted Meredith's sideline pass intended for Bob Hayes and raced 27 yards to the end zone, giving Cleveland a 17‚Äì10 lead. Then on the third play after the ensuing kickoff, Meredith threw a pass that bounced out of the grasp of Lance Rentzel and was picked off by defensive back Ben Davis, who returned the ball 3 yards to the Cowboys' 35. On the next play, Kelly took a pitch to the right and ran 35 yards for a touchdown, increasing Cleveland's lead to 24‚Äì10. Dallas coach Tom Landry eventually replaced Meredith with Craig Morton, who managed to lead the team to a 47-yard field goal by Clark with 3:24 left in the 3rd quarter. But 24‚Äì13 was as close as the score would get. On Cleveland's next drive, Nelsen's play action pass to Paul Warfield picked up 39 yards and a first down on the Dallas 11-yard line. Three plays later, Ernie Green's 2-yard touchdown run gave them an insurmountable 31‚Äì13 4th quarter lead. All that remained in the game would be Morton's meaningless 2-yard touchdown pass to fullback Walt Garrison with a minute left in regulation. The final 31 seconds would never be reached because the game had to be called off, as Cleveland fans spilled out on the field for an early victory celebration. http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1968/12/22/page/30/article/browns-bowl- over-cowboys-31-20 Nelsen completed 13 of 25 passes for 203 yards and a touchdown, with 1 interception. Kelly rushed for 87 yards, caught 2 passes for 46 yards, and scored 2 touchdowns. =Sunday, December 22, 1968= Western Conference: Baltimore Colts 24, Minnesota Vikings 14 Baltimore shut out the Vikings for the first three quarters and built a 21‚Äì0 lead to earn a trip to the NFL championship game. The Colts got their first scoring chance early in the first quarter when defensive back Jerry Logan intercepted a pass from Vikings QB Joe Kapp and returned it 24 yards to the Minnesota 22. The Vikings defense managed to prevent a score when Earsell Mackbee recovered a fumble from running back Tom Matte, but after a punt, Colts quarterback Earl Morrall completed a 39-yard pass to Willie Richardson that gave the team a first down on the Vikings' 36-yard line. On the next play, Richardson made a leaping catch on the 3-yard line for a 33-yard gain. Minnesota managed to stuff two Colts rushing attempts, but on third down, Baltimore got on the board with Morrall's 3-yard touchdown pass to Tom Mitchell. This ended up being the only score of the half. The only other highlights would be an interception from each team, by Ed Sharockman and Bobby Boyd. Colts kicker Lou Michaels missed a 33-yard field goal attempt early in the third quarter, but the Colts got the ball back with great field position at midfield after the Vikings punted. Then on the second play of the Colts' ensuing drive, Morrall threw a pass to tight end John Mackey, who broke ahead of linebacker Roy Winston, caught the ball and then raced past safeties Karl Kassulke and Paul Krause to score on a 49-yard touchdown completion, giving the Colts a 14‚Äì0 lead. Vikings returner Clint Jones gave his team a chance to get back in the game with a 35-yard kickoff return to the Colts' 42-yard line. However, on the second play of the possession, Colts lineman Bubba Smith plowed into Kapp as he was winding up to throw a pass, knocking the ball out of his hand and right into the arms of linebacker Mike Curtis, who returned the fumble 60 yards to the end zone. Faced with a 21‚Äì0 deficit in the 4th quarter, Minnesota drove 77 yards, aided by two catches by Gene Washington for 27 yards and a 33-yard pass interference penalty on Colts defensive back Lenny Lyles that gave them a first and goal on the Baltimore 1-yard line. After that, Kapp threw a 1-yard touchdown toss to tight end Bill Martin. However, a 33-yard field goal by Michaels quickly snuffed out the Vikings' hopes of a miracle comeback. All they could do with the remaining time was make the final score 24‚Äì14 when Kapp finished off a 73-yard drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to running back Bill Brown with 4 seconds left on the clock. Morrall completed 13 of 22 passes for 280 yards and two touchdowns, with 1 interception. Richardson caught 6 passes for 148 yards, while Mackey had 3 receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown. Kapp finished the day 26 of 44 for 287 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions. He was also the game's leading rusher with 10 carries for 52 yards. Washington caught 5 passes for 95 yards.http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1968/12/23/page/53/article/colts- ride-defense-into-n-f-l-final NFL Championship Game: Baltimore Colts 34, Cleveland Browns 0 Baltimore held Cleveland to just 173 total yards as they avenged their only regular season loss of the year, against the Browns, with a dominant shutout win. Cleveland crossed midfield only twice, just once in each half, and kicker Don Cockroft missed three field goal attempts. Things actually started out promising for Cleveland. Browns defensive back Ben Davis wiped out a scoring chance for Baltimore on their opening drive when he intercepted a pass from Earl Morrall on the Cleveland 14-yard line. The Browns then drove to the Colts' 35-yard line, with Bill Nelsen completing passes to Paul Warfield and Milt Morin for gains of 16 and 22 yards. However, Nelsen was dropped for a 7-yard loss on first down by Fred Miller and Ordell Braase. He managed to lead the team back to the 35 by the time they got to 4th down, but Cockroft's 42-yard field goal attempt was blocked by defensive tackle Bubba Smith. The Colts then took over and drove to a 3‚Äì0 lead on a 28-yard field goal by Lou Michaels. In the second quarter, Baltimore completely took over the game. Colts running back Tom Matte scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Colts a 10‚Äì0 lead. Later on, the Colts seemed to blow a scoring chance when tight end John Mackey lost a fumble that was recovered by Erich Barnes and returned 9 yards to the Browns' 23. But on the next play, linebacker Mike Curtis intercepted a pass from Nelsen on the 33, leading to Matte's 12-yard touchdown run that gave Baltimore a 17‚Äì0 lead going into halftime. After halftime, Cleveland forced a punt and got the ball on their own 40, where they proceeded to drive to the Colts' 38. But once again their drive stalled and Cockroft missed a 50-yard field goal attempt. He got another chance as a result of a penalty on the play, but missed again from 45 yards on his next attempt. After an exchange of punts, Baltimore got the ball on the Cleveland 48 and drove to a 24‚Äì0 lead on Matte's third touchdown of the day. Meanwhile, Nelsen was benched and replaced by Frank Ryan, but this did nothing to improve Cleveland's misfortunes. On his first play, he fumbled the snap, and linebacker Don Shinnick recovered the ball on the Browns' 20-yard line, leading to Michaels' second field goal, giving Baltimore a 27‚Äì0 lead on the second play of the 4th quarter. Ryan completed just 2 of 6 pass attempts for the rest of the game, while Colts running back Timmy Brown scored the final points on a 4-yard touchdown run. Matte, an Ohio native and former quarterback at Ohio State, was the sole offensive star of the game, rushing for 88 yards and 3 touchdowns, while also catching 2 passes for 15 yards.

Wagner's law of increasing state activity is named after him.  Biography  Born in Erlangen as the son of a university professor, the physiologist Rudolf Wagner, Adolph studied economics at the University of G√∂ttingen, receiving a doctorate in 1857 under supervision of . Wagner‚Äôs academic career took him first to the Merchants‚Äô Superior School, Vienna (1858‚Äì1863), then ‚Äì after failing to secure a chair at the University of Vienna because of disagreements over fiscal policy with Lorenz von Stein ‚Äì to the Hamburg Higher Merchants‚Äô School (1863‚Äì1865), both institutions comparable to business schools today. In 1865, he took the chair of Ethnography, Geography, and Statistics (in reality an economics professorship) at the University of Dorpat in Livonia which is located in the present day Estonia, but was then part of the Russian Empire. In Dorpat (Tartu), Wagner \\"became a follower of Bismarck‚Äôs policy for unifying Germany under Prussian guidance.Rubner, 435 Thus when German unification became realistic, Wagner wanted to go back to Germany proper. Beginning Fall Term 1868/69, Wagner therefore took over the Chair of the Cameralistic subjects (roughly, state management) at the Badensian University of Freiburg im Breisgau, and very soon afterwards, in 1870, the Chair of Staatswissenschaften at the University of Berlin, by that time not only the premier university in Germany but probably in the world. It was in Berlin, that Wagner began his tenure as one of the most intellectually and politically influential economists of his time. A former student of his, Werner Sombart, was his successor at the economics chair of the University of Berlin. Wagner was an early member of the conservative Christian Social Party, founded in 1878 by Adolf Stoecker as the Christlichsoziale Arbeiterpartei (Christian Social Workers' Party). Adolph Wagner by Nicola Perscheid c. 1910 Wagner died in Berlin in 1917.  Work  Wagner is the main protagonist of a specific school of economics and social policy, called \\"State Socialism\\" (\\"Staatssozialismus\\"), which is a specific form of Kathedersozialismus. (Albert Sch√§ffle (1831‚Äì1903), Lujo Brentano (1844‚Äì1931), Gustav von Schmoller (1838‚Äì1917) and Karl Rodbertus(-Jagetzow) (1805‚Äì1875) were important protagonists of that thought as well.) He was a member of the Historical school of economics, as his general review essay on Marshall's Principles of Economics so clearly demonstrates. However, he did fundamentally differentiate himself from what he called the 'younger' and more 'extreme' members of the German historical school such as Gustav von Schmoller who, according to Wagner, tended to dismiss too hastily what the latter terms the more deductive work of English writers (in short, those in the tradition of classical economics, including the famous contemporary Cambridge University Professor Alfred Marshall whose book he was reviewing).  Character  Wagner had a very combative and harsh personality. He did not take insults lightly and never phrased things diplomatically. He had difficulties with Schmoller and was an enemy of Lujo Brentano ‚Äì and these two were about his closest colleagues. By all contemporary accounts, it is probably fair to say that Wagner was vain, easily hurt and extremely choleric. In the 1890s, Wagner would so enrage an industrial-conservative member of the Reichstag, likewise with a defense of the Kathedersozialist influence within the University, that the deputy challenged him to a duel. (Wagner did not categorically refuse, but it was never fought.) An even more famous case was Wagner‚Äôs altercation with Eugen D√ºhring (against whom Friedrich Engels' Anti-D√ºhring is directed), and which in the very end resulted in D√ºhring's remotion and dismissal from the University of Berlin.  Life  Together with Gustav von Schmoller, Wagner belongs to the most important economists of the Bismarck period. He was a member of the Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik (Society for Social Policy). Wagner formulated the Law of Increasing State Spending, also known as \\"Wagner's Law.\\" His works set the stage for the development of the monetary and credit systems in Germany and substantially influenced the central bank policy and financial practice before World War I.

Among ancient Romans in Spain, sexual interaction between men was viewed as commonplace and marriages between men occurred during the early Roman Empire, but a law against homosexuality was promulgated by Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans, and Roman moral norms underwent significant changes leading up to the 4th century. The influence of Christianity eventually characterised sexuality as an act whose only goal was procreation, with homosexuality being viewed as one of many sexual activities that were sinful and against God's will. Laws against sodomy were later established during the legislative period. They were first repealed from the Spanish Code in 1822, but changed again along with societal attitudes towards homosexuality during the Spanish Civil War and Francisco Franco's regime. Throughout the late-20th century, the rights of the LGBT community received more awareness and same-sex sexual activity became legal once again in 1979 with an equal age of consent to heterosexual intercourse. Today, Spain has been recognised for providing one of the highest degrees of liberty in the world to its LGBT citizens. After recognising unregistered cohabitation between same-sex couples countrywide and registered partnerships in certain cities and communities since 1994 and 1997, Spain legalised both same-sex marriage and adoption rights for same-sex couples in 2005. Transgender individuals are allowed to change their legal gender without the need for sex reassignment surgery or sterilisation. Discrimination in employment regarding sexual orientation has been banned nationwide since 1995. LGBT people are allowed to openly serve in the military and MSMs have been allowed to donate blood since 2005. Spain has been recognised as one of the most culturally liberal and LGBT-friendly countries in the world and LGBT culture has had a significant role in Spanish literature, music, cinema and other forms of entertainment as well as social issues and politics. Public opinion on homosexuality is noted by pollsters as being overwhelmingly positive, with a study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2013 indicating that more than 88 percent of Spanish citizens accepted homosexuality, making it the most LGBT-friendly of the 39 countries polled. LGBT visibility has also increased in several layers of society such as the Guardia Civil, army, judicial, and clergy. However, in other areas such as sports, the LGBT community remains marginalised. Spanish film directors such as Pedro Almod√≥var have increased awareness regarding LGBT tolerance in Spain among international audiences. In 2007, Madrid hosted the annual Europride celebration and hosted WorldPride in 2017. The cities of Madrid and Barcelona also have a reputation as two of the most LGBT-friendly cities in the world. Gran Canaria is also known worldwide as an LGBT tourist destination. LGBT history in Spain Politician Pedro Zerolo was one of the most important LGBT activists in the history of Spain and one of the biggest promoters of extending the right to marriage and adoption to same-sex couples in the country.El legado de Pedro Zerolo =Roman Empire= Hispanic Roman Emperor Hadrian, lover of the boy Antinous, can be found today in the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome. The Romans brought, as with other aspects of their culture, their sexual morality to Spain. Romans were open-minded about their relationships, and sexuality among men was commonplace. Among the Romans, bisexuality seems to have been perceived as the ideal. Edward Gibbon mentions, of the first fifteen emperors, \\"Claudius was the only one whose taste in love was entirely correct\\" ‚Äì the implication being that he was the only one not to take men or boys as lovers. Gibbon based this on Suetonius' factual statement that \\"He had a great passion for women, but had no interest in men.\\"Suet. Claud. 33. Suetonius and the other ancient authors actually used this against Claudius. They accused him of being dominated by these same women and wives, of being uxorious, and of being a womaniser. Marriages between men occurred during the early Roman Empire. These marriages were condemned by law in the Theodosian Code of Christian emperors Constantius and Constans on 16 December 342.Theodosian Code 9.7.3: \\"When a man marries and is about to offer himself to men in womanly fashion (quum vir nubit in feminam viris porrecturam), what does he wish, when sex has lost all its significance; when the crime is one which it is not profitable to know; when Venus is changed to another form; when love is sought and not found? We order the statutes to arise, the laws to be armed with an avenging sword, that those infamous persons who are now, or who hereafter may be, guilty may be subjected to exquisite punishment. Martial, a first-century poet, born and educated in B√≠lbilis (now Calatayud in Aragon, Spain), but spent most of his life in Rome, attests to same-sex marriages between men during the early Roman Empire.Martial Epigrams 1.24, 12.42 He also characterised Roman life in epigrams and poems. In a fictitious first person, he talks about anal and vaginal penetration, and about receiving fellatio from both men and women. He also attests to adult men who played passive roles with other men. He describes, for example, the case of an older man who played the passive role and let a younger slave occupy the active role.Martial, 3.71. The first recorded marriage between two men occurred during the reign of Emperor Nero, who is reported to have married two other men on different occasions.Suetonius Life of Nero 28‚Äì29 Roman Emperor Elagabalus is also reported to have done the same. Emperors who were universally praised and lauded by the Romans such as Hadrian and Trajan openly had male lovers, although it is not recorded whether or not they ever married their lovers. Hadrian's lover, Antinuous, received deification upon his death and numerous statues exist of him today, more than any other non-imperial person. Among the conservative upper Senatorial classes, status was more important than the person in any sexual relationship. Thus, Roman citizens could penetrate non-citizen males, plebeian (or low class) males, male slaves, boys, eunuchs and male prostitutes just as easily as young female slaves, concubines and female prostitutes. However, no upper class citizen would allow himself to be penetrated by another man, regardless of age or status. He would have to play the active role in any sexual relationship with a man. There was a strict distinction between an active homosexual (who would have sex with men and women) and a passive homosexual (who was regarded as servile and effeminate). This morality was in fact used against Julius Caesar, whose allegedly passive sexual interactions with the King of Bithynia, Nicomedes, were commented everywhere in Rome. However, many people in the upper classes ignored such negative ideas about playing a passive role, as is proved by the actions of the Roman emperors Nero and Elagabalus. In contrast to the Greeks, evidence for homosexual relationships between men of the same age exists for the Romans. These sources are diverse and include such things as the Roman novel Satyricon, graffiti and paintings found at Pompeii as well as inscriptions left on tombs and papyri found in Egypt. Generally speaking, however, a kind of pederasty (not unlike the one that can be found among the Greeks) was dominant in Rome. It is important to note, however, that even among straight relationships, men tended to marry women much younger than themselves, usually in their early teens. Lesbianism was also known, in two forms. Feminine women would have sex with adolescent girls: a kind of female pederasty, and masculine women followed male pursuits, including fighting, hunting and relationships with other women. Another example is Hadrian, one of the Roman emperors born in Hispania, specifically in Italica (Santiponce today). He was emperor from 117 to 138. He had a famous young lover, Antinous, whom he deified and in whose honour he built the city of Antino√∂polis in Egypt after his death in the Nile. The first law against same-sex marriage was promulgated by the Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans.Theodosian Code 9.7.3: Nevertheless, the Christian emperors continued to collect taxes on male prostitutes until the reign of Anastasius (491‚Äì581). In the year 390, Christian emperors Valentinian II, Theodosius I and Arcadius declared homosexual sex to be illegal and those who were guilty of it were condemned to be burned alive in front of the public.(Theodosian Code 9.7.6): All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people. Christian Emperor Justinian I (527‚Äì565) made homosexuals a scapegoat for problems such as \\"famines, earthquakes, and pestilences.\\"Justinian Novels 77, 144 As a result of this, Roman morality changed by the 4th century. For example, Ammianus Marcellinus harshly condemned the sexual behaviour of the Taifali, a tribe located between the Carpathian Mountains and the Black Sea which practiced the Greek-style pederasty. In 342, emperors Constans and Constantius II introduced a law to punish passive homosexuality (possibly by castration), to which later in 390 Theodosius I would add death by fire to all passive homosexuals that worked in brothels. In 438, this law was expanded to include all passive homosexuals, in 533 Justinian punished any homosexual act with castration and death by fire, and in 559 this law became even more strict. Three reasons have been given for this change of attitude. Procopius, historian at Justinian's court, considered that behind the laws were political motivations, as they allowed Justinian to destroy his enemies and confiscate their properties, and were hardly efficient stopping homosexuality between ordinary citizens. The second reason, and perhaps the more important one, was the rising influence of Christianity in the Roman society, including the Christian paradigm about sex serving solely for reproduction purposes. Colin Spencer, in his book Homosexuality: A History, suggests the possibility that a certain sense of self-preservation in the Roman society after suffering some epidemic such as the Black fever increased the reproductive pressure in individuals. This phenomenon would be combined with the rising influence of Stoicism in the Empire. Until the year 313, there was no common doctrine about homosexuality in Christianity, but it is the mistaken belief that Paul had already condemned it as contra natura, though he had no exegetical reason for doing so: Eventually, the Church Fathers created a literary corpus in which homosexuality and sex were condemned most energetically, fighting against a common practice in that epoch's society.The poet Ausonius (310‚Äì395) maintained a passionate relationship with Paulinus, bishop of Nola. It is not known if that love was physical, but their passion was reflected in the correspondence they kept. The letters from Ausonius, 43 years the senior of Paulinus, also show his sadness regarding their separation when the latter intensified his Christian life. Even Saint Agust√≠ne confessed to having homosexual lovers in his youth, although he would later reject that lust as sinful (Homosexuality: A history, Colin Spencer, ). On the other hand, homosexuality was identified with heresy, not only because of the pagan traditions, but also due to the rites of some gnostic sects or Manichaeism, which, according to Augustine of Hippo, practised homosexual rites. =Kingdom of the Visigoths (418‚Äì718)= The Germanic peoples had little tolerance for both passive homosexuality and women, whom they considered on the same level as \\"imbeciles\\" and slaves, and glorified the warrior camaraderie between men. However, there are reports in Scandinavian countries of feminine and transvestite pastors, and the Nordic gods, the √Üsir, including Thor and Odin, obtained arcane recognition drinking semen. In the Early Middle Ages, attitudes toward homosexuality remained constant. There are known cases of homosexual behaviour which did not receive punishment, even if they were not accepted. For example, King Clovis I on his baptism day confessed to having relationships with other men; or Alcuin, an Anglo-Saxon poet whose verses and letters contain homoerotism. One of the first legal corpus that considered male homosexuality a crime in Europe was the Liber Iudiciorum (or Lex Visigothorum). The Visigoth law included in that code (L. 3,5,6) punished sodomy with banishment and castration. Within the term \\"castration\\" were included all sexual crimes considered unnatural, such as male homosexuality, anal sex (heterosexual and homosexual) and zoophilia. Lesbianism was considered sodomy only if it included phallic aids. It was King Chindasuinth (642‚Äì653) who dictated that the punishment for homosexuality should be castration. Such a harsh measure was unheard of in Visigoth laws, except for the cases of Jews practising circumcision. After being castrated, the culprit was given to the care of the local bishop, who would then banish him. If he was married, the marriage was declared void, the dowry was returned to the woman and any possessions distributed among his heirs. =Islamic Spain (718‚Äì1492)= The Muslims who invaded and successfully conquered the peninsula in the early 8th century had a noticeably more open attitude to homosexuality than their Visigothic predecessors. In the book Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia, Daniel Eisenberg describes homosexuality as \\"a key symbolic issue throughout the Middle Ages in Iberia\\", stating that in al-Andalus, homosexual pleasures were indulged in by the intellectual and political elite. There is significant evidence for this. Rulers, such as Abd-ar-Rahman III, Al- Hakam II, Hisham II, and Al Mu'tamid ibn Abbad, openly kept male harems, to the point that, to ensure an offspring, a girl had to be disguised as a boy to seduce Al-Hakem II.Charles-Emmanuel Dufourcq, La vie quotidienne dans l'europe m√©di√©vale sous domination arabe, Par√≠s, Hachette, 1978, pp. 134‚Äì135: \\"le deuxi√®me calife de Cordoue, al-Hakam [II], avait un harem bien rempli et, cependant, il arriva √† l'√¢ge de quarente-six ans sans avoir encore eu d'enfants; peut-√™tre s'int√©ressait-il davantage aux hommes qu'aux femmes; une esclave basque chr√©tienne r√©ussit pourtant √† le rendre p√®re: tr√®s jeune, intelligente et belle, elle avait adopt√© une mode en usage √† Bagdad: abandonnant toute toilette f√©minine, elle s'√©tait travestie en s'habillant comme un √©ph√®be. Le calife prit d'ailleurs l'habitude de l'appeler par le nom d'homme qu'elle avait choisi: Chafar.\\" Hay traducci√≥n espa√±ola, Vida cotidiana de los √°rabes en la Europa medieval, Madrid, Temas de Hoy, 1990. It was said that male prostitutes charged higher fees and had a higher class of clientele than did their female counterparts. Evidence can also be found in the repeated criticisms of Christians and especially the abundant poetry of homosexual nature. References to both pederasty and love between adult males have been found. Although homosexual practices were never officially condoned, prohibitions against them were rarely enforced, and usually there was not even a pretense of doing so. Sexual activity between men was not seen as a form of identity. Very little is known about lesbian sexual activity during this period. =Kingdom of Spain (1492‚Äì1812)= By 1492, the last Islamic kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula, the Emirate of Granada, was invaded and conquered by the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon. This marked the Christian unification of the Iberian peninsula and the return of repressive Catholic morality. By the early sixteenth century, royal codes decreed death by burning for sodomy and was punished by civil authorities. It fell under the jurisdiction of the Inquisition only in the territories of Aragon, when, in 1524, Clement VII, in a papal brief, granted jurisdiction over sodomy to the Inquisition of Aragon, whether or not it was related to heresy. In Castile, cases of sodomy were not adjudicated, unless related to heresy. The tribunal of Zaragoza distinguished itself for its severity in judging these offences: between 1571 and 1579 more than 100 men accused of sodomy were prosecuted and at least 36 were executed; in total, between 1570 and 1630 there were 534 trials and 102 executions.Kamen, Henry, The Spanish Inquisition, p. 259. This does not include, however, those normally executed by the secular authorities. =First French Empire= In 1812, Barcelona was annexed into the First French Empire and incorporated into the First French Empire as part of the department Montserrat (later Bouches-de-l'√àbre‚ÄìMontserrat), where it remained until it was returned to Spain in 1814. During that time same-sex sexual intercourse was legal in Barcelona. =Kingdom of Spain (1814‚Äì1931)= Marcela and Elisa got married in 1901 in A Coru√±a, with Elisa adopting a male name and appearance in order to pass as a man. Their marriage certificate was never annulled. In 1822, the Kingdom of Spain's first penal code was adopted and same-sex sexual intercourse was legalised. In 1928, under the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, the offense of \\"habitual homosexual acts\\" was recriminalised in Spain. =Second Spanish Republic= In 1932, same-sex sexual intercourse was again legalised in Spain. Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil, anarcha-feminist lesbian poet and activist founder of Mujeres Libres =Francoist Spain= At the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, the gay poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca was executed by Nationalist forces. Between 1936 and 1939, right-wing, Catholic forces lead by General Francisco Franco took over Spain, and Franco was dictator of the country until his death in 1975. Legal reforms in 1944 and 1963 punished same-sex sexual intercourse as \\"scandalous public behavior.\\" In 1954, vagrancy laws were modified to declare that homosexuals are \\"a danger\\", equating homosexuality with proxenetism (procuring). The text of the law declared that the measures \\"are not proper punishments, but mere security measures, set with a doubly preventive end, with the purpose of collective guarantee and the aspiration of correcting those subjects fallen to the lowest levels of morality. This law is not intended to punish, but to correct and reform\\". However, the way the law was applied was clearly punitive and arbitrary: police would often use the vagrancy laws against suspected political dissenters, using homosexuality (actual or perceived) as a way to go around the judicial guarantees. However, in other cases, the harassment of gay, bisexual and transgender people was clearly directed at their sexual mores, and homosexuals (mostly men) were sent to special prisons called galer√≠as de invertidos (\\"galleries of inverts\\"). Thousands of homosexual men and women were jailed, put in camps, or locked up in mental institutions under Franco's dictatorship, which lasted for 36 years until his death in 1975.Gays persecuted by Franco lose criminal status at last, The Guardian, Giles Tremlett, Madrid, 13 December 2001 The year Franco died, his regime began to give way to the current constitutional democracy, but in the early 1970s gay prisoners were overlooked by political activism in favour of more \\"traditional\\" political dissenters. Some gay activists deplored the fact that reparations were not made until 2008. However, in the 1960s, a clandestine gay scene began to emerge in Barcelona, and in the countercultural centers of Ibiza and Sitges (a town in the province of Barcelona, Catalonia, that remains a highly popular gay tourist destination). In the late 1960s and the 1970s, a body of gay literature emerged in Catalan.Josep-Anton Fern√†ndez: Another Country: Sexuality and National Identity in Catalan Gay Fiction, Volume 50./Modern Humanities Research Association: Texts and dissertations, p. 1., MHRA, 2000, Attitudes in greater Spain began to change with the return to democracy after Franco's death through a cultural movement known as La Movida Madrile√±a. This movement, along with growth of the gay rights movement in the rest of Europe and the Western world, was a large factor in making Spain today one of Europe's most socially tolerant places. In 1970, Spanish law provided for a three-year prison sentence for those accused of same-sex sexual intercourse. =Kingdom of Spain (1975‚Äìpresent)= Same-sex sexual intercourse was again legalised in Spain in 1979, and is its status today. In December 2001, the Spanish Parliament pledged to wipe clean the criminal records of thousands of gay and bisexual men and women who were jailed during Franco's regime. The decision meant that sentences for homosexuality and bisexuality were taken off police files.Gays persecuted by Franco lose criminal status at last The Guardian Further reparations were made in 2008. Law regarding same- sex sexual activity Same-sex sexual acts were lawful in Spain from 1822 to 1954, with the exception of the offence of \\"unusual or outrageous indecent acts with same-sex persons\\" between the years 1928 and 1932. However, some homosexuals were arrested in the days of the Second Spanish Republic under the Ley de Vagos y Maleantes (\\"Vagrants and Common Delinquents Law\\"). Homosexual acts were made unlawful during Francisco Franco's time in power, first by an amendment to the aforementioned law in 1954, and later by the Ley de Peligrosidad y Rehabilitaci√≥n Social (\\"Law on Danger and Social Rehabilitation\\") in 1970. In 1979, the Adolfo Su√°rez Government reversed the prohibition of homosexual acts. A new penal code was introduced in Spain in 1995 which specified an age of consent of 12 for all sexual acts, but this was raised to 13 in 1999 and to 16 in 2015. Recognition of same-sex relationships Gay Pride 2005 celebrating the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Spain In 1994, the Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos was passed, giving same-sex couples some recognition rights. Registries for same-sex couples were created in all of Spain's 17 autonomous communities: Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), the Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and Le√≥n (2002), Extremadura (2003), the Basque Country (2003), the Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008), La Rioja (2010) and Murcia (2018), and in both autonomous cities; Ceuta (1998) and Melilla (2008). These registries grant unmarried couples some benefits, but the effect is mainly symbolic. Same-sex marriage and adoption were legalised by the Cortes Generales under the administration of Socialist Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero in 2005.Spain gives approval to gay unions, The New York Times, Renwick McLean, 1 July 2005 Soon after the same-sex marriage bill became law, a member of the Guardia Civil, a military-police force, married his lifelong partner, prompting the organisation to allow same-sex partners to cohabitate in the barracks, the first police force in Europe to accommodate a same-sex partner in a military installation. Adoption and parenting Adoption by same-sex couples has been legal nationwide in Spain since July 2005. Some of Spain's autonomous communities had already legalised such adoptions beforehand, notably Navarre in 2000, the Basque Country in 2003, Aragon in 2004, Catalonia in 2005 and Cantabria in 2005. Furthermore, in Asturias, Andalusia and Extremadura, same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. Since 2015, married lesbian couples can register both their names on their child(ren)'s certificates. This does not apply to cohabiting couples or couples in de facto unions, where the non-biological mother must normally go through an adoption process to be legally recognized as the child's mother. Lesbian couples and single women may access in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and assisted reproductive treatments. Prior to 2019, this was mostly in the private sector, where such treatments were much more expensive (around 7,500 euros for IVF). In 2018, following reports that Spain had one of the lowest birth rates in Europe (with reportedly more deaths than births in 2017), measures extending free reproductive treatments for lesbians and single women to public hospitals were announced. The measures took effect in January 2019. Surrogacy is prohibited in Spain regardless of sexual orientation, though surrogacy arrangements undertaken overseas are usually recognized.Asociaci√≥n por la gestaci√≥n subrogada en Espa√±a ‚Äì ¬øCu√°l es la situaci√≥n? (In Spanish) Retrieved 18 August 2014 Discrimination protections thumbright280pxLaws on LGBT discrimination in employment, by autonomous community Employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has been illegal in the country since 1995. However, employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not banned nationwide. The first autonomous community to ban such discrimination was Navarre in 2009. The Basque Country followed suit in 2012. In 2014, Andalusia, the Canary Islands, Catalonia, and Galicia also passed bills banning discrimination. Extremadura did so in 2015. In 2016, Madrid, Murcia, and the Balearic Islands all passed laws protecting transgender people from discrimination. Valencia approved an anti-discrimination bill in April 2017, while Aragon did so in April 2018 (taking effect in January 2019). Article 4(2) of the Workers' Statute () reads as follows: Discrimination in the provisions of goods and services based on sexual orientation and gender identity is not banned nationwide either. The aforementioned autonomous communities all ban such discrimination within their anti-discrimination laws. Discrimination in health services and education based on sexual orientation and gender identity has been banned in Spain since 2011 and 2013, respectively. Ten autonomous communities also ban discrimination based on sex characteristics, thereby protecting intersex people from discrimination. These autonomous communities are Galicia (2014), Catalonia (2014), Extremadura (2015), the Balearic Islands (2016), Madrid (2016), Murcia (2016), Valencia (2017), Navarre (2017), Andalusia (2018), and Aragon (2019). In 2017, a comprehensive bill to forbid discrimination against LGBTI people throughout Spain in all areas, including employment, the provision of goods and services, etc. was introduced to the Cortes Generales. The legislation has stalled. =Bias-motivated speech and violence= Hate speech on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity has been banned since 1995. Additionally, under the country's hate crime law, crimes motivated by the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity, amongst other categories, result in additional legal penalties. The Secretary of State for Security reported that instances of violence against LGBT people decreased 4% in 2018. This contrasted with figures from other sources. The Observatorio Madrile√±o reported a 7% increase in anti-LGBT violence in Madrid, while the Observatory Against Homophobia of Catalonia () reported a 30% increase in the first few months of 2019. Since January 2019, teachers and students in Madrid are obliged to report cases of bullying, including against LGBT students. Military service Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people may serve openly in the Spanish Armed Forces. Transgender and intersex rights Commemorative plaque in Madrid to La Veneno, a transgender women visible on Spanish television in the 90s. In November 2006, the Zapatero Government passed a law that allows transgender people to register under their preferred sex in public documents such as birth certificates, identity cards and passports without undergoing prior surgical change. The law came into effect on 17 March 2007. In July 2019, the Constitutional Court of Spain declared that prohibiting transgender minors from accessing legal gender changes is unconstitutional. The court ruled that transgender minors who are \\"mature enough\\" may register their new sex on their identity cards, and struck down the article of the 2007 legislation that limited this possibility only to those over 18. The first minor to change his legal gender did so in December 2019. Intersex infants in Spain may undergo medical interventions to have their sex characteristics altered. Human rights groups consider these surgeries unnecessary and, they argue, should only be performed if the applicant consents to the operation (i.e. has reached the age of 18). Andalusia, Aragon, the Balearic Islands, Extremadura, Madrid, Murcia, Navarre, and Valencia ban the use of medical interventions on intersex children. In April 2019, the Catalan Department of Labor, Social Affairs and Families announced that official documents in Catalonia would include the option \\"non- binary\\" alongside male and female. Blood donation Gay and bisexual men are allowed to donate blood in Spain. For anyone regardless of sexual orientation, the deferral period is six months following the last sexual encounter. Conversion therapy The autonomous community of Madrid approved a conversion therapy ban in July 2016. The ban went into effect on 1 January 2017, and applies to medical, psychiatric, psychological and religious groups. In August 2016, an LGBT advocacy group brought charges under the new law against a Madrid woman who offered conversion therapy.Madrid LGBT group takes action over ‚Äògay cure therapy‚Äô In September 2019, the woman was fined 20,000 euros. Murcia approved a conversion therapy ban in May 2016, which came into effect on 1 June 2016. Unlike the other bans, the Murcia ban only applies to health professionals. Valencia banned the use of conversion therapies in April 2017. Andalusia followed suit in December 2017, with the law coming into force on 4 February 2018. Ley 8/2017, de 28 de diciembre, para garantizar los derechos, la igualdad de trato y no discriminaci√≥n de las personas LGTBI y sus familiares en Andaluc√≠a In January 2019, Aragon made it an offense to promote and/or perform conversion therapy. In April 2019, the Government of the Community of Madrid announced it was investigating the Roman Catholic Diocese of Alcal√° de Henares for violating conversion therapy laws. This followed reports that a journalist named √Ångel Villascusa posed as a gay man and attended a counselling service provided by the diocese. Villascusa alleged the bishop was running illegal conversion therapy sessions. The bishop was defended by the Catholic Church in Spain. Minister of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare Mar√≠a Luisa Carcedo called for a nationwide ban on conversion therapy. She said, \\"they [the Church] are breaking the law therefore, in the first instance, these courses have to be completely abolished. I thought that, in Spain, accepting the various sexual orientations was assumed in all areas, but unfortunately we see that there are still pockets where people are told what their sexual orientation should be\\". LGBT rights movement in Spain Europride 2007 in Madrid Madrid Pride 2015 Gay Pride in Valencia, 2019 The first gay organisation in Spain was the Spanish Homosexual Liberation Movement (MELH, Movimiento Espa√±ol de Liberaci√≥n Homosexual, Moviment Espanyol d'Alliberament Homosexual), which was founded in 1970 in Barcelona. The group also established centers in Madrid and Bilbao. It disbanded in 1973 because of police pressure, but following Franco's death, several members of the group formed the Front d'Alliberament Gai de Catalunya (FAGC) in 1975 to continue campaigning for LGBT rights. Several more groups were established, including the Euskal Herriko Gay-Les Askapen Mugimendua in the Basque Country, the Frente Homosexual de Acci√≥n Revolucionaria in Madrid, and the Coordinadora de Frentes de Liberaci√≥n Homosexual de Estado Espa√±ol (COFLHEE), all three in 1977. On 28 June 1977, the FAGC organised the first gay demonstration in Spain in the city of Barcelona with about 4,000 to 5,000 participants. Police repressed the event, with several arrests and injuries. Exactly one year later, the Frente de Liberaci√≥n Homosexual de Castilla held a demonstration in Madrid with about 10,000 people. Disagreement within these groups caused many to shut down; many members advocated a more \\"radical\\" movement with public demonstrations and many felt the organizations had failed to properly address or campaign for the rights of lesbians and bisexuals. LGBT groups saw an important landmark moment in 1979 with the decriminalisation of homosexuality. During the 1980s, several LGBT groups and magazines were launched in various cities. The Federaci√≥n Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales (FELGTB), today Spain's largest LGBT organization, was founded in 1992 from members of the then-former COFLHEE. The groups campaign for legal rights for same-sex couples and LGBT people, societal acceptance, operate counseling centers about topics such as coming out, sex, relationships or health issues, and organize various events and festivals. Several gay villages exist in Spain, including Chueca in Madrid, \\"Gaixample\\" in Barcelona, Ibiza, Maspalomas in Gran Canaria, and Sitges. Nowadays, numerous pride parades and other LGBT festivals are held throughout Spain, including Madrid Pride, whose 2019 edition had 400,000 participants according to police, Barcelona, Gran Canaria, Seville, Bilbao, A Coru√±a, Valencia, Zaragoza, Murcia, Palma de Mallorca, Cartagena, Valladolid, Benidorm, Ibiza, Sitges, Maspalomas, Torremolinos, and many more. Public opinion Homosexuality and bisexuality today are greatly accepted all around the country and intensely in larger and medium cities. That being said, a certain level of discrimination can still be encountered in small villages and among some parts of society. A Eurobarometer survey published December 2006 showed that 66 percent of Spanish people surveyed supported same-sex marriage and 43 percent supported same-sex couples' right to adopt (EU-wide averages were 44 percent and 33 percent, respectively). On 4 March 2013, Interior Minister Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az said that due to same-sex marriages the survival of the human species is not guaranteed.Spanish interior minister says 'survival of species' at stake in gay marriage row, Fiona Govan, Madrid; 4 March 2013; The Daily Telegraph He also stated that same-sex marriages should not have the same protection under the law as opposite-sex ones, eight years after same-sex marriage was legalized.Gay marriage, long legal in Spain, now in its dictionary, Los Angeles Times, 25 June 2012, Emily Alpert Among the countries studied by the Pew Research Center in 2013, Spain was rated first in acceptance of homosexuality, with 88% of Spaniards believing that homosexuality should be accepted by society, compared to 11% who disagreed. In May 2015, PlanetRomeo, an LGBT social network, published its first Gay Happiness Index (GHI). Gay men from over 120 countries were asked about how they feel about society's view on homosexuality, how do they experience the way they are treated by other people and how satisfied are they with their lives. Spain was ranked 13th with a GHI score of 68.The Gay Happiness Index. The very first worldwide country ranking, based on the input of 115,000 gay men Planet Romeo Buzzfeed conducted a poll in December 2016 across several countries on the acceptance of transgender individuals. Spain ranked the most accepting in most categories, with 87% of those polled believing transgender people should be protected from discrimination, and only 8% believing there is something mentally or physically wrong with them. In addition, 77% believed transgender people should be allowed to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity rather than being forced to use the one of their birth- assigned gender, with over 50% strongly agreeing with this. The 2015 Eurobarometer found that 84% of Spaniards thought that same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, 10% were against. The 2019 Eurobarometer showed that 91% of Spaniards believed gay and bisexual people should enjoy the same rights as heterosexual people, and 86% supported same-sex marriage. LGBT culture =Literature= Jacinto Benavente, Nobel Prize in Literature Federico Garc√≠a Lorca in 1932 At the beginning of the 20th century, Spanish authors, like Jacinto Benavente, Pedro de R√©pide and Antonio de Hoyos y Vinent, had to choose between ignoring the subject of homosexuality or representing it negatively. The only authors publishing literature with LGBT content were foreigners: Augusto d'Halmar from Chile published Pasi√≥n y muerte del cura Deusto, Alfonso Hern√°ndez Cat√° from Cuba published El √°ngel de Sodoma, and Alberto Nin Fr√≠as from Uruguay published La novela del renacimiento y otros relatos, La fuente envenenada, Marcos, amador de la belleza, Alexis o el significado del temperamento Urano and, in 1933, Homosexualismo creador, the first essay representing homosexuality in a positive light. Others, such as the authors of the Generation of '27, took refuge in poetry. The gay and bisexual poets of this literary movement were amongst the most influential in Spanish literature: Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Emilio Prados, Luis Cernuda, Vicente Aleixandre and Manuel Altolaguirre. These poets were highly influenced by the great gay authors of the rest of Europe, such as Oscar Wilde, Andr√© Gide, mainly his Corydon, and Marcel Proust. In 1930, Emilio Garc√≠a G√≥mez also published his Poemas arabigoandaluces, which included the pederastic poets of Al-Andalus. Around the mid-1930s, there was a slight liberalisation which ended with the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. After the Civil War, with Garc√≠a Lorca assassinated and the majority of gay and bisexual poets in exile, gay culture retired anew to the cryptic poetry of Vicente Aleixandre, who never admitted his homosexuality publicly. Other gay poets of this period are Francisco Brines, Leopoldo Mar√≠a Panero, Juan Gil- Albert and Jaime Gil de Biedma and, in C√≥rdoba, Vicente N√∫√±ez, Pablo Garc√≠a Baena and Juan Bernier, belonging to the C√°ntico group. Authors that appear after the Spanish Transition include Juan Goytisolo, Luis Antonio de Villena, Antonio Gala, Terenci Moix, √Ålvaro Pombo, Vicente Molina Foix,Alfredo Mart√≠nez Exp√≥sito, ¬´Vicente Molina Foix¬ª, in Who's Who in Contemporary Gay and Lesbian History, Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon (ed.), Routledge, 2001, p.141. Antonio Roig, Biel Mesquida, Leopoldo Alas, Vicente Garc√≠a Cervera, Carlos Sanrune, Jaume Cela, Eduardo Mendicutti, Miguel Mart√≠n, Lluis Fern√°ndez, V√≠ctor Monserrat, Alberto Card√≠n, Mariano Garc√≠a Torres, Agust√≠n G√≥mez-Arcos, √ìscar Esquivias, Luisg√© Mart√≠n and I√±aki Echarte. No lesbian authors in Spain publicly acknowledged their homosexuality until the 1990s. Gloria Fuertes never wanted her sexual orientation to be public. The first lesbian author to be openly gay was Andrea Luca. Other authors who have treated love between women in their books include Ana Mar√≠a Moix, Ana Rosetti, Esther Tusquets, Carmen Riera, Elena Fort√∫n, Isabel Franc and Luc√≠a Etxebarr√≠a, whose novel Beatriz y los cuerpos celestes won the Nadal Prize in 1998. =Cinema and television= Bibiana Fern√°ndez, a Spanish transgender actress Early representation of homosexuality in Spanish cinema was difficult due to censorship by the Franco regime. The first movie that shows any kind of homosexuality, very discreetly, was Diferente, a musical from 1961, directed by Luis Mar√≠a Delgado. Up to 1977, if homosexuals appeared at all, it was to ridicule them as the \\"funny effeminate faggot\\". During the Spanish transition to democracy, the first films appeared where homosexuality was not portrayed in a negative way. Examples are La Muerte de Mikel from Imanol Uribe and Oca√±a, retrat intermitent from Ventura Pons. In these films, authors experiment with different visions of gay men: the transvestite in Un hombre llamado Flor de Oto√±o (1978), the manly and attractive gay man in Los placeres ocultos (1976) from Eloy de la Iglesia, the warring \\"queen\\" in Gay Club (1980), etc. Homosexuality is the center of the plot, and homosexuals are shown as vulnerable, in inner turmoil and in dispute with society. Beginning in 1985, homosexuality loses primacy on the plot, in spite of still being fundamental. This trend begins with La ley del deseo (1987) from Pedro Almod√≥var and continues with films like Tras el cristal (1986) from Agust√≠ Villaronga, Las cosas del querer (1989) and Las cosas del querer 2 (1995) from Jaime Ch√°varri. Successful films include Perdona bonita, pero Lucas me quer√≠a a m√≠ (1997), Segunda piel (1999), Km. 0 (2000), Plata quemada (2000), Los novios b√∫lgaros (2003) and Cachorro (2004). Undoubtedly, Spain's most known LGBT person is Pedro Almod√≥var. Almod√≥var has often intertwined LGBT themes in his plots, and his films have turned him into one of the most renowned Spanish movie directors. Apart from Almod√≥var, Ventura Pons and Eloy de la Iglesia are two film directors who have worked on more LGBT themes in their movies. In September 2004, movie director Alejandro Amen√°bar publicly announced his homosexuality. There have not been as many Spanish films with a lesbian plot. The most renown may be the comedy A mi madre le gustan las mujeres (2002), and the romantic drama Room in Rome (Habitaci√≥n en Roma) (2010). The most- important LGBT film festivals are LesGaiCineMad in Madrid and the Festival internacional de cinema gai i l√®sbic de Barcelona (FICGLB). There are also many other smaller festivals and shows, including Festival del Mar in the Balearic Islands, Festival del Sol in the Canary Islands, Zinegoak in Bilbao, LesGaiFestiVal in Valencia or Zinentiendo in Zaragoza. In 2018, √Ångela Ponce became the first transgender woman to win the Miss Universe Spain title, and was the first transgender woman to contest for Miss Universe 2018. =Music= Special illumination of the Auditorio Kursaal in San Sebasti√°n for Pride Day During Franco's dictatorship, musicians seldom made any reference to homosexuality in their songs or in public speeches. An exception was the copla singer Miguel de Molina, openly homosexual and against Franco. De Molina fled to Argentina after being brutally tortured and his shows prohibited. Another exception was Bambino, whose homosexuality was known in flamenco circles. Some songs from Raphael, as \\"Qu√© sabe nadie\\" (\\"What does anyone know\\") or \\"Digan lo que digan\\" (\\"Whatever they say\\"), have frequently been interpreted in a gay light. In 1974, the folk rock band C√°novas, Rodrigo, Adolfo y Guzm√°n talked about a lesbian relationship in the song \\"Mar√≠a y Amaranta\\" (\\"Mar√≠a and Amaranta\\"), that surprisingly was not censored. During the transition to democracy, the duo Vainica Doble sung about the fight of a gay man against the prejudices of his own family in the song \\"El rey de la casa\\" (\\"The king of the house\\"). Singer-songwriter V√≠ctor Manuel has included LGBT subjects in several of his songs. In 1980, he released \\"Qui√©n puso m√°s\\" (\\"Who put more?\\"), a true love story between two men that ends after 30 years. He later mentioned transsexuality in his song \\"Como los monos de Gibraltar\\" (\\"As the monkeys in Gibraltar\\"), feminine homosexuality in \\"Laura ya no vive aqu√≠\\" (\\"Laura doesn't live here any more\\") and bisexuality in \\"No me llames loca\\" (Don't call me fool/queen). It was not until the La Movida Madrile√±a that homosexuality became visible in Spanish music. The duo Pedro Almod√≥var and Fabio McNamara usually dressed as women during their concerts, where they sang provocative lyrics. Tino Casal never hid his homosexuality and became an icon for many gay people. Nevertheless, it would be the trio Alaska, Nacho Canut y Carlos Berlanga who would be identified from the beginning with the LGBT movement due to their constant references to homosexuality in their lyrics and their concerts. During their time as Dinarama, they recorded the song \\"¬øA Qui√©n le Importa?\\" (\\"Who cares?\\"), which became a gay anthem in Spain. After the Movida, several artists continued to make music with homosexual themes, such as Fabio McNamara, Carlos Berlanga in \\"Vacaciones\\" (\\"Holiday\\"), or Luis Migu√©lez, ex-guitarist of Dinarama and later member of Glamour to Kill. At the end of the 1980s, Mecano made a hit with the song \\"Mujer contra mujer\\" (\\"Woman against woman\\"), clearly defending the love of two women. There were French (\\"Une femme avec une femme\\") and Italian (\\"Per Lei Contro Di Lei\\") versions. The song was a huge hit in France in 1990 where it reached No. 1 in charts during seven weeks. The song was also a hit in Latin America and is one of the most remembered of the group. They later composed the song \\"Stereosexual\\" that talked about bisexuality. In 1988, Tam Tam Go!, in the album \\"Spanish shuffle\\", included the song \\"Manuel Raquel\\", the only song in Spanish in the album, which told the story of a transsexual. Tino Casal included in his 1989 album Histeria the very explicit song \\"Que digan misa\\". At the beginning of the 1990s, new singer-songwriters also took up the subject, especially Inma Serrano, Javier √Ålvarez, and Andr√©s Lewin, but also Pedro Guerra in his song \\"Otra forma de sentir\\" (\\"Another way of feeling\\") or Tontxu in \\"¬øEntiendes?\\" (\\"Do you understand?\\"). Other artists with diverse styles also used the theme, as \\"El cielo no entiende\\" (\\"Heaven doesn't understand\\") by OBK, \\"Entender el amor\\" (\\"Understand love\\") by M√≥nica Naranjo, \\"El d√≠a de a√±o nuevo\\" (\\"New Year's Day\\") by Amaral, \\"Eva y Mar√≠a\\" by Materia Prima, \\"Sacrif√≠cate\\" by Amistades Peligrosas, \\"La revoluci√≥n sexual\\" by La casa azul, \\"√Ångeles\\" by Merche, \\"Como una flor\\" by Mal√∫, \\"Da igual\\" by Taxi, \\"El que quiera entender que entienda\\" by M√§go de Oz, etc. Indie pop has also treated homosexuality from different points of view, as the band Ellos in the song \\"Diferentes\\" (\\"Different\\"), or L Kan in \\"Gayhetera\\" (Gayhereto). The duo Astrud has been related to gay culture. The leather subculture has the band Gore Gore Gays with themes that range from LGBT demands to explicit sex. Within the indie pop universe, many other bands produce songs almost exclusively for a gay public, especially gay-friendly or with a clear gay content (Nancys Rubias, Lorena C, Spunky, La Terremoto de Alcorc√≥n, Putilatex, Putirecords, Borrachas provincianas, Vanity Bear, Model√© Fatale, Dos Hombres Solos, Postura 69, etc.) and some drag queens have a successful career in music, such as La Prohibida, Nacha la Macha, or La Otxoa. = Politics = Ada Colau, the openly bisexual Mayor of Barcelona Several openly gay politicians have served in public office in Spain. One of the most prominent gay politicians is Jer√≥nimo Saavedra, who served as President of the Canary Islands twice from 1982 to 1987 and again from 1991 to 1993. Saavedra came out as gay in 2000. He served as a member of the Senate until 2004, and was Mayor of Las Palmas from 2007 to 2011. Another prominent gay politician and activist was Pedro Zerolo, who served on the City Council of Madrid until his death in June 2015. Zerolo was known for his LGBT activism and was one of the biggest promoters of the law extending the right to marriage to same-sex couples, leading many to label him a gay icon. Others include Javier Maroto, formerly serving as mayor of the Basque capital of Vitoria-Gasteiz from 2011 to 2015 and currently serving as senator. Maroto married his fianc√© Jos√© Manuel Rodr√≠guez in September 2015. The marriage ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. M√°ximo Huerta, √Ångeles √Ålvarez and Fernando Grande-Marlaska are other gay politicians who serve/have served in the Cortes Generales. Grande-Marlaska has served as Minister of the Interior since June 2018. Ada Colau, elected Mayor of Barcelona in 2015, revealed her bisexuality in December 2017. Other Catalan gay politicians include Antoni Com√≠n, Santi Vila and Miquel Iceta. Carla Antonelli, V√≠ctor Casco, I√±igo Lamarca, Fran Ferri, Jes√∫s V√°zquez Abad, I√±aki Oyarz√°bal, Empar Pineda and Luis Alegre Zahonero are other openly LGBT politicians, variously serving as mayors or members of regional legislatures. In 2007, Manuela Trasobares won a seat as a councillor in the small Valencian town of Geldo, becoming the first openly transgender Spaniard to hold public office. = Sports = Mapi Le√≥n, lesbian footballer and player in the Spain women's national football team. Sports is traditionally a difficult area for LGBT visibility. Recently though, there have been professional sportswomen and sportsmen who have come out. These include Mapi Le√≥n and Ana Romero in football, V√≠ctor Guti√©rrez in waterpolo, Carlos Peralta in swimming, Marta Mangu√© in handball, Javier Raya in figure skating and Miriam Blasco in judo. In February 2019, the right-wing party Vox vetoed a motion calling for an official stance against homophobia in sports. The motion, supported by every other political party, required unanimity to be adopted.

It is unrelated to Old World orioles (family Oriolidae). It is a breeding resident in the tropics of eastern South America. This bird is noted for its close association with the palm Mauritia flexuosa (moriche, buriti, ita, it√©, etc.). This ecologically distinct bird was formerly treated as a species Icterus chrysocephalus. It was eventually found to be embedded in the epaulet oriole (I. cayanensis) clade. Thus, for example the AOU since 2005 has lumped the moriche oriole into I. cayanensis. The subspecific structure of I. cayanensis is still rather puzzling.SACC (2008) This is a slim bird, 8.7 in (22 cm) long and weighing 1.5 oz (42 g), with a long tail and thin decurved bill. It has mainly black plumage, apart from a bright yellow crown, rump, thighs and wing epaulets. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile bird is dark brown rather than black, with duller yellow patches. The song of the moriche oriole is a squeaky whistling '. This is an often-conspicuous species near its favoured tree, and usually occurs singly or in pairs. Moriche palm forest on the Pregui√ßa River, Maranh√£o (Brazil) The mochique oriole breeds from eastern Colombia, Venezuela, Trinidad and the Guianas, and south to eastern Ecuador, Paraguay and northern Brazil. The Trinidadian population may have originated from recent colonisation or escapes. It is most common from sea level up to 1,600 ft (500 m) ASL, but here and there it reaches up to around 3,300 ft (1,000 m) in the eastern foothills of the Andes, which mark the western border or its range.Salaman et al. (2002) The moriche oriole is a bird closely associated with moriche palms (Mauritia flexuosa), and it is found in the forests, swamps or savannah where that tree occurs. This bird eats mainly insects, but will also take nectar and some fruit. Its nest is a long hanging basket of grass and other plant fibres, suspended from the end of a moriche palm branch. The normal clutch is two dark-spotted pale blue or white eggs. It is affected to some extent by trapping for the cagebird trade, but can cope with heavy disturbance to its habitat as long as some moriche palms remain.

With 16 teams in the league in 1967, this was the first season that the NFL used a four-team playoff tournament. The four division winners advanced to the postseason, with the two division winners in each conference meeting in the first round (effectively being conference championship games). The championship game this year was the famous Ice Bowl, played in Green Bay on December 31. Although the Baltimore Colts (11‚Äì1‚Äì2) had tied for the best record in the league, they lost the new division tie-breaker (point differential in head-to-head games) to the Los Angeles Rams and were excluded from the postseason. The teams had tied in mid-October in Baltimore and the Colts entered the last game undefeated, but lost 34‚Äì10 to the Rams in Los Angeles on December 17. In previous seasons, unscheduled tiebreaker games were played (with head-to-head results disregarded); the last was just two years earlier. Tournament bracket Within each conference, the two division winners qualified for the playoffs. In the first round, the Capitol Division winner met the Century Division winner in the Eastern Conference game, while the Coastal Division winner faced the Central Division winner in the Western Conference game. The conference champions advanced to the NFL Championship Game, whose winner played the American Football League champion in Super Bowl II at the Orange Bowl in Miami on January 14. The losers of the conference championship games met in the third place Playoff Bowl, also in Miami, on January 7. Prior to , the playoff sites rotated and were known prior to the start of the season. In 1967, the hosts were the Capitol and Central division winners for the conference championships (first round), and the Western Conference for the championship game, effectively giving home field advantage to the Central Division winner, the two-time defending NFL champion Green Bay Packers, who clinched their division title with three games remaining. The 1968 playoff hosts were Century, Coastal, and Eastern, respectively, and 1969 was like 1967. The rotation system forced the Rams (11‚Äì1‚Äì2) to play at the Packers (9‚Äì4‚Äì1) in the Western Conference playoff. It had no effect in the Eastern Conference; Cleveland and Dallas were both 9‚Äì5, and the Cowboys defeated the Browns during the regular season. With the rotation system it was common for the host team to have an inferior record; it had occurred in four of the previous five NFL championship games (1962, 1964, 1965, 1966), with the home teams winning twice (1964, 1965). Conference championships =Saturday, December 23, 1967= Western Conference: Green Bay Packers 28, Los Angeles Rams 7 The Rams came into the Western Conference Championship with all the momentum, possessing the NFL's best record, but having barely beaten the Packers two weeks earlier by a score of 27‚Äì24. In that game in Los Angeles, the Rams blew a 4th quarter lead, and needed a last-second touchdown set up by a blocked punt to pull out the game and keep their division title hopes alive, while the Packers had already clinched their division (and had home field in the playoffs) and were playing only for pride. In this postseason game, Green Bay would be playing for more than pride, as they were attempting win a third consecutive NFL title, unprecedented in the playoff era. The weather was expected to be cold and snowy; the snow held off but the temperature was . However, the field condition was poor, and the Rams had accused the Packers of over watering the field to slow down the devastating pass rush of the Rams' Fearsome Foursome, who sacked Starr six times in the game in L.A. For three weeks prior, the field at County Stadium was covered by a tarpaulin and thirty tons of hay. By the end of the game, LA forced four turnovers, three fumble recoveries and an interception. But they were only able to convert one of them into a score, a first quarter fumble by Carroll Dale that was recovered by defensive back Chuck Lamson on the Rams' 46-yard line. This set up Roman Gabriel's 29-yard touchdown pass to Bernie Casey, giving the Rams a 7‚Äì0 lead. But this was all the Rams could do in the first half, as Green Bay's defense took over. Three times, they would drive into Green Bay territory, and each time they would fail to score. Lamson's interception of a Bart Starr pass resulted in nothing when Dave Robinson blocked Bruce Gossett's 24-yard field goal attempt. The Rams also lost the ball twice in Packers territory as a result of failed 4th down conversion attempts. In the second quarter, Green Bay defensive back Tom Brown returned a punt 39 yards to the Rams 46-yard line. On the next play, rookie Travis Williams raced 46 yards for Green Bay's first touchdown. Later on, Gossett's 46-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts, and Willie Wood returned the ball 44 yards to the Packers' 45. The Packers then drove 55 yards in 10 plays to score on Starr's 18-yard touchdown pass to Dale, giving the team a 14‚Äì7 lead going into halftime. Led by Jerry Kramer and Forrest Gregg, the Packers' offensive line neutralized the vaunted \\"Fearsome Foursome\\" of Los Angeles. Where they had thoroughly harassed Starr in the Rams' victory two weeks before, Starr was sacked only once in the playoff contest. The Packers defensive line took Gabriel down five times (3.5 of the sacks were by Henry Jordan) and pressured him into throwing inaccurate passes all day. Early in the third quarter, LA recovered another Green Bay fumble, giving them a first down on the Packers' 26-yard line. But this drive ended with no points when Gossett missed another field goal try, this one a 37-yard attempt. The Packers then drove 80 yards to go up 21‚Äì7 on Chuck Mercein's 6-yard touchdown run. In the 4th quarter, Starr's 48-yard completion to Dale set up the final score on a 3-yard touchdown run by Williams. This was the only NFL playoff game ever held at Milwaukee County Stadium. Starr completed 17 of 23 passes for 222 yards and a touchdown, with 1 interception, while also rushing for 8 yards. Dale caught 6 passes for 109 yards and a score. Williams rushed for 88 yards and two touchdowns, while also catching an 8-yard pass. Gabriel completed just 11 of 31 passes for 186 yards and a touchdown, with 1 interception. Casey caught 5 passes for 81 yards and a touchdown. Lamson had two fumble recoveries and an interception. =Sunday, December 24, 1967= Eastern Conference: Dallas Cowboys 52, Cleveland Browns 14 Like the Dallas Cowboys, the wildly inconsistent Cleveland Browns underachieved themselves to a 9‚Äì5 record. The Browns featured one of the best running games in the league with Leroy Kelly, while the Cowboys had one of the best run defenses in the game. \\"Dandy\\" Don Meredith, the Cowboys quarterback, had been hampered by injuries all year, but Meredith was fully recovered for the contest with the Browns, completing 10 of his 12 pass attempts for 212 yards and 2 touchdowns. Dallas scored on their opening drive, moving the ball 80 yards in 13 plays, including a 24-yard run by Don Perkins, to score on Meredith's 3-yard touchdown pass to running back Craig Baynham. Later in the first quarter, Cowboys receiver Bob Hayes returned a punt 64 yards before punter Gary Collins tackled him on the Browns' 13-yard line. Four plays later, Perkins crashed through the line for a 1-yard touchdown run on fourth down to give Dallas a 14‚Äì0 lead. In the second quarter, Cleveland seemed ready to respond when Leroy Kelly took off for a 46-yard run to the Cowboys' 10-yard line. But after being forced into a 4th down situation, a bad snap spoiled Lou Groza's field goal attempt. Dallas took over on their own 10-yard line, and two plays later, Hayes raced past Browns cornerback Mike Howell, caught a pass from Meredith past midfield, and took it all the way to the end zone for an 86-yard touchdown reception. Following a punt, Dallas drove 52 yards in 9 plays to score on Danny Villanueva's 10-yard field goal, giving them a 24‚Äì0 lead. With time running out in the second quarter, Cleveland quarterback Frank Ryan put together a last second touchdown drive, completing a 15-yard pass to Kelly and two passes to tight end Milt Morin for gains of 10 and 12 yards (the 12-yard reception converted a 4th and 11 situation). With just 4 seconds left on the clock, Ryan cut the score to 24‚Äì7 with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Morin. Still any hopes of a comeback were quickly dashed in the second half, as Meredith completed a 36-yard pass to Hayes on the Browns' 4-yard line that set up Baynham's 1-yard touchdown run, putting the Cowboys up 31‚Äì7. Cleveland responded with a drive to midfield, but this was stopped cold when Kelly was stuffed for no gain on 4th and 1. The Browns managed to prevent a score when linebacker Dale Lindsey recovered a fumble from Lance Rentzel on the Browns' 18-yard line, but their offense ended up punting again, and Hayes returned it 68 yards to the Cleveland 2. Three plays later, Perkins' 1-yard touchdown made the score 38‚Äì7. Then it became 45‚Äì7 when Cornell Green intercepted Ryan's pass and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown. Meredith was replaced by Craig Morton for most of the fourth quarter, but Dallas still managed to put together another touchdown drive, moving the ball 57 yards to Baynham's 3rd touchdown of the game, this one on a 1-yard run. Meanwhile, all Cleveland could do was cut the final score to 52‚Äì14 when Ryan threw a 75-yard touchdown pass to Paul Warfield with 2:12 left in the game. Hayes finished the game with five receptions for 144 yards and 3 punt returns for 141. His 141 punt return yards was an NFL playoff record until broken by Anthony Carter in the 1987 playoffs. His special teams effort would make a huge difference, as both teams were fairly even in yards gained (401 for Dallas, 322 for Cleveland) and turnovers (2 for Cleveland, 1 for Dallas) Perkins rushed for 74 yards and two touchdowns, while also catching a 4-yard pass. Ryan finished the game 14/30 for 194 yards, with two touchdowns and 1 interception. Kelly rushed for 96 yards and caught 4 passes for 39. Warfield caught 3 passes for 99 yards and a touchdown.

Born in Prescott, Ontario, James Walsh was one of the original officers of the NWMP. Superintendent Walsh was assigned in 1875 to establish a post in the Cypress Hills in what is now Saskatchewan. He named it Fort Walsh after himself. The location of the post was determined by the Cypress Hills Massacre in 1873, an atrocity stemming from the illegal American whiskey trade. Walsh's original role was to shut down this trade, but in June 1876 his position grew in importance when several thousand Sioux crossed the border into Canada, taking refuge there after the Battle of Little Big Horn. They settled near the Wood Mountain post in present-day Saskatchewan. Walsh developed a strong friendship with the famous Sioux leader Sitting Bull and successfully kept peace in the region. By the summer of 1877, Walsh, although still in command of Fort Walsh, spent little time there. His headquarters became the Wood Mountain post, among Sitting Bull and 5,000 Sioux. During this time, Walsh became famous in the American press as \\"Sitting Bull's Boss.\\" In reality, Walsh was unable to fulfill his orders to convince Sitting Bull to return to the U.S.. The Canadian government decided that Walsh's friendship with Sitting Bull was an obstacle to the Sioux's return to the United States, and in 1880 he was transferred to Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan. Soon after, he took health leave and returned to Ontario. He reluctantly resigned his commission three years later. In August 1897, during the height of the Klondike Gold Rush, Walsh was appointed Commissioner of the newly created Yukon Territory. He resigned soon after in 1898. His successor was William Ogilvie. He died in Brockville, Ontario in 1905. Mount Walsh, a mountain peak in the Saint Elias Mountains in the Yukon is named after him.

He is credited as a co-creator of the television series Lost. In addition to writing for television and film, Lieber also blogs at the website dailykos. His blog posts, which appear as \\"diaries\\" rather than front-page posts, typically have a satirical take on the news. Early life He was born in Evanston, Illinois, United States and attended Evanston Township High School. He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and earned a BFA in acting from the Department of Theatre. Career Lieber is credited on the films Tuck Everlasting and Tangled, as well as having been creator/executive producer for unaired TV pilots for Fox Broadcasting Company (2004) and Sony Television in (2008). ABC hired Lieber, based on his pitch with studio Spelling Television, to write a pilot for Lost. Lieber's initial pitch for the series, then titled Nowhere, was a realistic drama series heavily influenced by Lord of the Flies and Cast Away. As the project developed, ABC soured on the direction they'd given Lieber, and approached J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof, who had an overall deal with their own studio, to rewrite. An industry-standard arbitration was triggered by the competing drafts and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) ultimately recognized Lieber as co-creator of the show (Lieber shares story credit with Abrams and Lindelof on the pilot). Aside from his initial pilot scripts, Lieber had no further input into Lost. Lieber and the Lost writing staff won the Writers Guild of America (WGA) Award for Best Dramatic Series at the February 2006 ceremony for their work on the first and second seasons. In 2010, Miami Medical was canceled after 13 episodes. From 2011 to 2013, he served as an Executive Producer and Showrunner on the USA Network show Necessary Roughness.

She had been a member of the New Forest coven which met during the late 1930s and early 1940s, and through this became a friend and working partner of Gerald Gardner, who would go on to found the Gardnerian tradition with her help. Widely known under the nickname of Dafo, Woodford-Grimes' involvement in the Craft had largely been kept a secret until it was revealed in the late 1990s, and her role in the history of Wicca was subsequently investigated by historians. The reason for Woodford-Grimes' adoption of the pseudonym Dafo is unknown, with the researcher Philip Heselton believing that it was not her craft name but a nickname given to her by Gardner, possibly being based upon his experiences in eastern Asia, where it had been used to refer to certain statues of the Buddha.Heselton 2000. p. 117. Biography =Early life: 1887‚Äì1938= Woodford-Grimes was born as Edith Rose Wray in a house in Malton, Yorkshire, on 18 December 1887. Her father, William Henry Wray, was an implement maker at the local waterworks, whilst her mother was Caroline Wray, n√©e Harrison.Heselton 2000. p. 117-118.[family lore, interview with her first cousin, twice removed]. Relatives from Malton orally explained that her grandfather, William Wray, was a Primiive Methodist preacher. Edith and her siblings received early education in a school run by the Primitive Methodist Church of Malton. Each year scholarships were provided for chosen students. Edith had a teacher who felt she had tremendous potential and pursued opportunities for further education. Edith won ascholarship through the Primitive Methodist church of Malton. Whilst much is still not known about her early life, she became a teacher, specialising in English, Drama and Music, in later years becoming an associate of the London College of Music and the London Academy of Music.Heselton 2000. p. 119. On 16 June 1920, she married Samuel William Woodford Grimes, an Englishman who had been born in Bangalore, India in 1880, who at the time was working as a clerk in the War Pensions Office in Southampton. Subsequently, she took his surname of Grimes, and decided to turn it into a double-barrelled surname by adding one of his middle names, Woodford, to it. As researcher Philip Heselton later remarked, \\"This may have been pure snobbery, or she may have felt that it sounded more elegant and exclusive ‚Äì more befitting a teacher of elocution.\\"Heselton 2000. p. 119-120. Soon after the marriage, the couple moved to a newly constructed house, 67 Osborne Road, which was found in the Portswood suburb of Southampton in southern England. Then, on 30 June 1921, Edith and Samuel's first and only child, Rosanne, was born, but within a few years Edith returned to work, as by 1924 she had gained employment once more as a tutor in English and Dramatic Literature at various student groups, something she would continue till 1934, and from 1924 she had also begun teaching elocution and dramatic art at evening classes for the Southampton Education Authority.Heselton 2000. p. 121-124. Eventually, the relationship between the couple broke down, and although they remained married (divorce being hard to acquire at the time), they separated. Woodford-Grimes decided to move away from Southampton, and so relocated to Christchurch, Hampshire by 1938. Here she purchased a newly built bungalow in Dennistoun Avenue, Somerford, and began working as a private teacher of elocution and dramatic art.Heselton 2000. p. 124. It was at her new home in Christchurch that she became involved in a local esoteric group, the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship. Becoming increasingly interested in their philosophies and practices, she decided to name her bungalow \\"Theano\\", which had been the name of the wife of the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras. Woodford-Grimes herself had performed the role of Theano in a play about Pythagoras that the Crotona Fellowship had put on, and which had been written by the group's leader, George Alexander Sullivan. =Involvement with Wicca: 1939‚Äì= It was through the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship that Woodford-Grimes likely met members of another local esoteric group, the New Forest coven, which was one of the earliest recorded Wiccan covens to exist. Its members considered themselves the continuation of the historical Witch- Cult, an ancient religion that the anthropologist Margaret Murray had described in several books published in the 1920s and 1930s. Nonetheless, subsequent investigation and research by historians has disputed that the Witch-Cult had ever existed, and as such it appears that the New Forest coven were in fact a group who had been founded in the early 1930s.Heselton 2003. p. 384-387. Following this marriage, Rosanne and her new husband moved into Woodford-Grimes' bungalow, Theano, whilst she herself relocated once more to Avenue Cottage in Walkford, the village adjacent to Highcliffe, where Gardner and his wife Donna lived.Heselton 2000. p. 124-125. Gardner, discussing the publication of his two books on witchcraft, mentions that he felt obliged to have the permission of the witches he knew to do so. It is now widely assumed that this was a reference to 'Dafo', who appears to have been a great deal more publicity-shy than Gardner was. In the late 1940s, Gerald Gardner founded the Bricket Wood coven, and was joined by Dafo. However, she left the coven in 1952, fearing Gardner's growing publicity would expose her. In winter 1952 Gardner invited Doreen Valiente, a prospective witch, to meet him and Dafo at her house. They met here on several occasions, and on Midsummer 1953 Gardner initiated Valiente into the craft at Dafo's home. The three of them then set off to Stonehenge, where they watched the Druids performing a ritual there.Valiente 1989. p. 39-40. By 1954, Dafo had started living with a strictly Christian niece, who disapproved of occultism and witchcraft. Dafo therefore kept her past involvement with witchcraft secret from her family. In 1958, three separate groups of witches approached her, asking for her to verify Gardner's claims. Dafo did not respond to two of these, and denied having any involvement other than a theoretical interest in the craft to the third.Hutton 1999. p. 212-216. The historian Ronald Hutton, in his 1999 book The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, said that he had not researched into Dafo's past, because she would not have wanted such a thing, as most of her family were strict Christians. Legacy Woodford- Grimes has left an enduring legacy in the Wiccan and greater Neopagan community who recognise her as one of the earliest known adherents of her faith. Because she never became publicly known in her lifetime, and the fact that she intentionally denied her involvement in the Craft towards the end of her life, Woodford-Grimes' identity would not be publicly known till several decades after her death. Nonetheless, her involvement in the New Forest coven under her pseudonym of Dafo was known, and was occasionally featured in published sources: one of the earliest of these was in June Johns' 1969 biography of Alex Sanders, King of the Witches, in which she incorrectly spelled the pseudonym as \\"Daffo\\".Johns 1969. p. 15. After her identity was revealed, she became well known in Wiccan circles, for instance the Neopagan bard Francis Cameron delivered a prose interpretation of her life and involvement with the Craft, written as if from her own point of view, entitled \\"Dafo's Tale\\", at The Charge of the Goddess conference 2010, held at Conway Hall in London.The Centre for Pagan Studies (2010).

Saal The Konzerthaus is a concert hall located in Vienna, Austria, which opened in 1913. It is situated in the third district just at the edge of the first district in Vienna. Since it was founded it has always tried to emphasise both traditional and innovative musical styles. In 1890, the first ideas for a Haus f√ºr Musikfeste (House for music festivals) came about. The idea of the new multi-purpose building was to be more interesting to the broader public than the traditional Vienna Musikverein. In addition to the concert hall, the first drawings by Ludwig Baumann for the Olympion included an ice-skating area and a bicycle club. In an attached open air area, 40,000 visitors would be able to attend events. Although the drawings were not accepted, today an ice skating area is situated right next to the building. The Konzerthaus was finally built between 1911 and 1913. The architects were Fellner & Helmer; the work was done in cooperation with Ludwig Baumann. Performance facilities The building is about 70√ó40 meters and had originally three halls, in which there can be simultaneous concerts, since they are sound-proofed. The original Art Nouveau building was partly destroyed during renovations and adaptions, but the building was reconstructed from original sketches in the 1970s. A historic organ was installed in the Konzerthaus by the Austrian firm Rieger in 1913.

The school originated as the Columbus Boychoir in Columbus, Ohio. In 1950, the school relocated after receiving property in Princeton, New Jersey from the Lambert estate. The relocated school was renamed the American Boychoir School. It remained in this location until the sale of Albemarle in 2012. The school served boys in grades 4‚Äì8, many of whom came from across the United States and from many countries. It was one of only two boychoir boarding schools in the United States, the other being Saint Thomas Choir School in New York City. The school provided opportunity to boys from across the world to experience the rich world of music. The Boychoir toured across the contiguous United States, allowing students to gain diverse cultural perspective while performing at the professional level. The American Boychoir performed with numerous orchestras, frequently including the New York Philharmonic as well as the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra. In 2002, the school was embroiled in a scandal due to allegations of sexual abuse of students by faculty and other students. The school served as the basis for a fictionalized choir in the 2014 film Boychoir. From 2012 to 2015, the school's location changed multiple times due to declining admissions and limited funding options as well as poor financial decisions on the part of the administration. In 2015, the school filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and ultimately closed on August 15, 2017. Choir The American Boychoir performed in concerts across the United States and at international venues. On average, the choir made over 200 appearances in four to five major tours annually. The choir performed with the New York Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, The St. Olaf Choir, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, and several opera singers including Jessye Norman, Frederica von Stade and Kathleen Battle. The choir had television appearances on NBC's Today show and was featured on sixteen recordings. In the 2004‚Äì2005 season, the Boychoir performed at the 77th annual Academy Awards with pop singer Beyonc√© Knowles and with Jessye Norman before the United States Open (tennis) women's singles final. The choir also had tours across the United States and Canada, an appearance in Boston and at Carnegie Hall in celebration of James Levine‚Äôs inaugural season as Music Director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and six performances with the Philadelphia Orchestra. From 2013 to 2016, the Concert Choir completed several national tours (several to the Midwest and Southern states, California and the Northwest, Texas and the Southwest), and sang at festivals in South Korea and France. The combined Training and Concert Choirs contributed to Tim Janis' The American Christmas Carol at Carnegie Hall in December, 2015. The Boychoir was featured often by the Philadelphia Orchestra; highlights included Carmina Burana in October 2013, Bach's St. Matthew Passion in April 2015, and, most recently Mahler's Symphony 8 in March, 2016. The American Boychoir was subdivided into two choirs: the Concert Choir and the Training Choir. The Concert Choir, last conducted by Fernando Malvar-Ruiz, performed and toured regularly while the Training Choir, last conducted by Fred Meads, was made up of first-year students who receive training in order to move up to the Concert Choir when they were ready. Boys joined the choir by auditioning while visiting the school, or auditioning after Boychoir performances at concert sites or after school programs. An alumnus could join the Alumni Chorus, conducted by music director emeritus, James Litton. Auditions were required for enrollment into The American Boychoir School. School The American Boychoir School was a non-profit, non-sectarian organization. The school did not discriminate in its admissions, scholarship programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, gender or religion, and was an accredited member of Middle States Association. Admissions were rolling and boys often joined the student body after the school year had begun. The school's educational program was designed to be largely interdisciplinary, with project based learning (PBL) its primary focus. Classes were small (maximum of 12 students) and boys studied in self-contained classrooms with a grade-level teacher who delivered the Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science curricula in interdisciplinary \\"modules.\\" 4th and 5th grade boys studied together in a class labeled the \\"Lower School.\\" The goal of all student work was authentic, summative assessment of individual and group achievement, and boys regularly reported on their learning to audiences of their peers, as well as experts in specific fields outside the school. Mathematics instruction at the school was entirely differentiated by student and delivered with mixed methodology which included direct and dedicated Mathematics teacher instruction, textbook interaction, and a web-based Mathematics curriculum (TenMarks) that was supported by a 1:1 iPad program. Each student studied Mathematics independently (with small group instruction when warranted and appropriate) and proceeded according to his own abilities and interests; as a result, within each grade level, boys may have been working below, at, or above sometimes far above grade level. All boys received Latin instruction. The Latin curriculum emphasized grammar and vocabulary that supported parallel Language Arts development, and simple story translation. All boys also received Music Theory instruction at one of four levels and all new boys received keyboard training for their first year at the school. Physical education classes were held four days per week. All boys participated. Many graduates of the school went on to the most competitive independent high schools around the country, including Interlochen Arts Academy, Phillips Exeter Academy, Phillips Academy, Lawrenceville School, Peddie School, St. Andrew's School, and Avon Old Farms. About 20-30% of ABS graduates went on to their home public high schools. = Academics on tour = The educational program was integrated with the Boychoir's touring responsibilities throughout the school year. Modules at each grade level were developed to take advantage of the routes the boys followed when they toured. Much effort was made to match the curricula with enrichment activities while on tour, such as visits to museums, historical sites, and environmental areas that illustrated and enhanced what the boys were learning. One teacher traveled with every tour. =Summer music programs= The American Boychoir had two distinct summer music programs: Camp Albemarle and The American Boychoir Experience. Camp Albemarle provided choruses, a musicianship training program and a small group vocal instruction training program. The American Boychoir Experience was for boys ages 9‚Äì12 only, and provided the experience of one week in the life of an American Boychoir School student without the academic classes. The week included choral training, music theory, in addition to traditional summer camp activities. This professional experience in choral training culminated in a formal concert. An audition was necessary to participate in The American Boychoir Experience.  History  Albemarle, the 1917 estate of pharmaceutical magnate Gerard Lambert, home to the school from 1952‚Äì2012 The choir and school were founded in Columbus, Ohio, in 1937, by Herbert Huffman who believed that \\"the experience of performing the great choral literature ‚Äì and performing it at the highest professional levels ‚Äì could have a profound effect on the academic, social and moral development of boys\\". Founded as the Columbus Boychoir, the group moved to Princeton in 1950. It changed its name to the American Boychoir in 1980. Former choir directors at the choir school include Herbert Huffman (founder), Donald Bryant, Robert W. Haley, Howard Jewell, Donald G. Hanson, John Kuzma, Jim Litton, Craig Denison, Wallace Hornady and Nathan Wadley. The choir recorded for RCA Victor during Herbert Huffman's tenure before moving to the Decca Label during the Donald Bryant years, where the choir released multiple LP's including one with Bing Crosby. Later, the boychoir would release CDs on its own Albermarle Records label. (see complete Discography below). From 1985 to 2001, the boychoir was conducted by James Litton, an expert on children's choral techniques and vocal production. Regarded as one of America's prominent choral conductors, Litton led the boychoir in more than 2,000 concerts in 49 states and 12 nations. Litton also introduced the changing voice and established SATB sections in the choir. He helped recognize that all boys should continue singing regardless of their voice change.James Litton: Music Director, American Boychoir. Accessed October 21, 2007. In 2012, the choir's longtime home, Albermarle in Princeton, was sold under the presidency of Robert Rund and the choir moved to the Princeton Center for the Arts & Education (formerly St. Joseph's Seminary) for the 2013 and 2014 school years. On April 10, 2015, the school filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy stating it needed $350,000 to finish the school year and $3 million to come out of bankruptcy and open for the next academic year. On April 14, 2015, the school announced it would end the school year early, on May 17, instead of reaching the normal time for graduation, the second week of June. The school reopened on September 1, 2015, and operated during the 2015-16 school year while working to satisfy its financial obligations and emerge from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy stable and able to move forward successfully. School operations were moved to the campus of Rambling Pines Summer Camp, site of the former Princeton Latin Academy. Rambling Pines provided classroom and office space, gymnasium space, and almost 200 acres of playing fields. The American Boychoir School closed on August 15, 2017. [1] =2002 lawsuit and sexual abuse allegations= In April 2002, The New York Times reported sexual abuse which had taken place at the Boychoir School several decades earlier by Choir Director Donald G. Hanson and other staff.Diana Jean Schemo, \\"Decades of Sex Abuse Are Described at Choir School in New Jersey\\", The New York Times, April 16, 2002. Accessed January 11, 2008. \\"In a court filing, the school accused Mr. Hardwicke of negligence, saying if he had been abused he should have spoken up at the time. The school argued that it was not responsible for Mr. Hanson's behavior or Mr. Hardwicke's well-being, and said that Mr. Hardwicke, then 12, had consented to sex.\\" In court documents, the American Boychoir claimed that it had no duty to protect children in their care from sexual abuse and that children who were abused were themselves negligent for not bringing the abuse to light. One of the students who had claimed that he was victimized was constitutional scholar Lawrence Lessig, who has represented another student, John Hardwicke, in his lawsuit against the school.Heilemann, John. \\"The Choirboy: As head boy at a legendary choir school, Lawrence Lessig was repeatedly molested by the charismatic choir director, part of a horrific pattern of child abuse there. Now, as one of America‚Äôs most famous lawyers, he‚Äôs put his own past on trial to make sure such a thing never happens again.\\", New York (magazine), May 30, 2005. Accessed July 29, 2007. In its court filings, the school claimed that Hardwicke, then 12, had consented to sex and said that he was negligent in not reporting the incident at the time. Many other boys have now come forward and said they were sexually abused, either by staff members or other older students enrolled at the school. This alleged abuse occurred in the 1970s, 1980s, and into the late 1990s. The school adopted new policies to protect the boys from further sexual abuse, but paid over $850,000 in settlement money to one victim to avoid further lawsuits. On August 8, 2006, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled against the school's appeal of a lower court decision.Institutional Liability and Statutes of Limitation in Sexual Abuse cases, Hardwick v. American Boychoir School, 902 A. 2d 900 (N.J. 2006), School Law Reporter vol. 48 no. 11 (Nov. 2006).Text of NJ Supreme Court decision . The school had contended that the state's charitable immunity act protected it from liability in sexual abuse lawsuits brought by former students. The court found that the Charitable Immunity Act immunizes charities for negligence only; it does not bar statutory or common-law claims that are based on willful, wanton or grossly negligent conduct. The school's lawyers requested the New Jersey Supreme Court to reconsider the decision, claiming the ruling represented a major extension of vicarious liability.New Jersey Lawyer Online, News Brief 2006-08-21, \\"Lawyer: Boychoir decision expands vicarious liability\\" On January 5, 2006, then-Governor of New Jersey Richard Codey signed bill S540/A2512 into New Jersey law, ending the Boychoir's charitable immunity defense, and making New Jersey the 48th state to allow victims of childhood sex abuse to sue churches, schools and other non-profits for the actions of their staff.Deborah Howlett, Newark Star-Ledger, January 6, 2006, \\"Charities lose sex-lawsuit ‚Äì Codey signs bill allowing legal action against pedophiles' employers\\", cite from here .

Employers could offer a \\"take it or leave it\\" AWA as a condition of employment. They were registered by the Employment Advocate and did not require a dispute resolution procedure. These agreements operated only at the federal level. AWAs were individual written agreements on terms and conditions of employment between an employer and employee in Australia, under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. An AWA could override employment conditions in state or territory laws except those relating to occupational health and safety, workers' compensation, or training arrangements. An AWA was required to meet only the most minimal Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Agreements were not required to include effective dispute resolution procedures, and could not include prohibited content. Agreements were for a maximum of five years; approved, promoted and registered by the Workplace Authority; operated to the exclusion of any award; and prohibited industrial action regarding details in the agreement for the life of the agreement. The introduction of AWAs was a very controversial industrial relations issue in Australia. During a Senate Estimates hearing on 29 May 2006, Peter McIlwain, Head of the Office of the Employment Advocate detailed that from a sample of 4 per cent, or 250, of the total 6,263 AWAs lodged during April 2006 after WorkChoices was introduced, that: 100% removed at least one protected Award condition; 64% removed annual leave loadings; 63% stripped out penalty rates; 52% cut out shift loadings; 40% dropped gazetted public holidays; and 16% slashed all award conditions and only the Government's five minimum conditions are satisfied.[6] New AWAs were banned under the Fair Work Act 2009. Coverage As of May 2004, AWAs had achieved coverage of about 2.4% of the workforce.Employee Earnings and Hours, Australia, May 2004: Australian Bureau of Statistics Mining companies pushed the agreements with some success, offering substantial increases in pay to workers who chose to sign an AWA. According to OEA statistics, as of 31 December 2004, 1,410,900 persons were covered under Union Certified Agreements, 168,500 under non-union Certified Agreements, and 421,800, or over 21%, were covered by AWAs. By 31 December 2005 this had risen to 1,618,200 under Union Certified Agreements, 185,300 under non-union Certified Agreements, and 538,200 Australian Workplace Agreements.Certified agreement and Australian workplace agreement coverage from estimates and statistics collated by Office of the Employment Advocate, Accessed 12 June 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics figures published in March 2005 showed hourly wages of workers on AWAs were two percent lower than the hourly wages of workers on registered collective agreements, mostly negotiated by unions.The impact on Workers of Australian Workplace Agreements by Professor David Peetz, June 2005.

In the federal public service the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations reported that as of 31 December 2004, out of 124,500 public and parliamentary service permanent staff, there were 11,085 AWAs (covering 1928 Senior Executive Service (SES), where AWAs are compulsory, and 9,157 other employees).DEWR statistics on AWAs in the Federal Public Service from Union gets ready for hostile Senate by Verona Burgess, Australian Financial Review, 8 April 2005, as published in CPSU bulletin April 2005 The rest of the permanent staff were covered, as at 30 March 2005, by 101 certified agreements, of which 70 were union enterprise agreements and 31 non-union enterprise agreements.Percentage of Union and Non-union Certified Agreements in the Federal Public Service from Union gets ready for hostile Senate by Verona Burgess, Australian Financial Review, 8 April 2005, as published in CPSU bulletin April 2005 According to a report in The Australian newspaper in March 2007, about five per cent of the total workforce were at that time employed on AWAs, with about 32 per cent of miners employed on AWAs, but this figure was much higher in Western Australia where up to 52 per cent were on AWAs. Rio Tinto pioneered individual employment contacts under the common law in the 1980s in Western Australia with productivity improvements of between 20 and 35 per cent, according to Rio Tinto managing director Charlie Lenegan.Employers Defend Howard's AWAs Despite Slow Take-Up by Brad Norington & Andrew Trounson, The Australian, 31 March 2007, p. 33. Opposing views The union movement saw AWAs as an attempt to undermine the collective bargaining power of trade unions in the negotiation of pay and conditions of their members. Unions argued that the ordinary working person has little to no bargaining power by themselves to effectively negotiate an agreement with an employer, hence there is inherently unequal bargaining power for the contract. For exceptional individuals in a workplace, or industries with a labor shortage, the union movement argues that common law contracts are sufficient. They also believe that while commercial law and common law provides for fairness and equality of bargaining power, AWAs were designed to entrench inequality between an employer and their workforce with regard to pay and conditions. The policy of the ACTU was that AWAs should be abolished and that the bargaining system should contain collective bargaining rights.ACTU policy on abolishing AWAs : ACTU Congress, Melbourne, 2003 Most unions warned their members to be very cautious about signing AWAs, and if they did so, to appoint the union as their bargaining agent. For example, the Australian Services Union warned members: > AWAs are about one thing: tipping the balance of power more firmly towards > your employer and away from you.Australian Services Union Accessed May 2005 In the Western Australian Parliament in May 2005, the Labor Minister for Consumer and Employment Protection stated his belief that AWAs were being used to reduce wages and conditions of employment in Western Australia.Question on AWAs reducing wages in WA directed to Mr J.C. KOBELKE, the Labor Minister for Consumer and Employment Protection, Western Australia in May 2005 The Howard Government and most business groups maintained that AWAs were mutually beneficial for employers and employees, often promoting the view that 'flexibility' is paramount: > AWAs give employers and employees flexibility in setting wages and > conditions, and enable them to agree on arrangements that suit their > workplaces and individual preferences.

The spreadsheets were based on a sample of AWA agreements. In response to ongoing criticisms of WorkChoices and AWAs, then-Prime Minister John Howard announced the introduction of a new \\"fairness test\\" with an advertising campaign in May 2007 targeting women and youth which did not mention specifically either WorkChoices or AWAs. However, the changes were not retrospective, leaving tens of thousands of workers on contracts that have removed conditions without the compensation that would be required under the current test. Howard stated: > Can I just say that it was never intentional that it should become the norm > that penalty rates and overtime loadings should be traded off without proper > compensation. The fairness test will guarantee in a very simple way that > will not occur. On 19 March 2008, a bill was passed in the Senate that prevented new AWAs from being made, and set up provisions for workers to be transferred from AWAs into intermediate agreements.House of Reps seals 'death' of WorkChoices - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) See also *Australian Council of Trade Unions *Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard *2007 Australian federal election *Australian industrial relations legislation, 2005 *Australian Industrial Relations Commission *Australian labour movement *WorkChoices Notes References * Workplace Relations Act (1996) via Austlii External links * Office of the Employment Advocate * ACTU Assistant Secretary, Richard Marles on Individual Contracts * Fair Go - NSW Government website on the changes * ACCI Workplace Relations Policy Blueprint Category:Australian labour law Category:Industrial agreements ","title":"Australian workplace agreement"},{"id":"1962405","text":"The McWane Science Center (formerly known as the McWane Center) is a science museum and research archive located in downtown Birmingham, Alabama (United States).

Bowerman, Jr. (\\"Jay\\") was born November 17, 1942. =Military career= Bowerman had been in the ROTC and Army Reserve, and then joined the United States Army as a 2nd Lieutenant in the days following the Pearl Harbor attack. He was assigned to Fort Lawton in Washington and served a year there before being assigned to the 86th Mountain Infantry Regiment at Camp Hale in Leadville, Colorado. Along with the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, his regiment would become the 10th Mountain Division.Moore, p. 67-68 Bowerman's duty entailed organizing the troops' supplies and maintaining the mules used to carry the supplies in the mountains. On December 23, 1944, the division arrived in Naples, Italy and soon moved north to the mountains of northern Italy.Moore, p. 71 During his tour of duty, Bowerman was promoted to commander of the 86th Regiment's First Battalion at the rank of Major.Moore, p. 77 Bowerman negotiated a stand-down of German forces near the Brenner Pass in the days before the surrender of the German army in all of Italy.Moore, p. 78-79 For his service, Bowerman received the Silver Star and four Bronze Stars. He was honorably discharged in October 1945.Moore, p. 81 Coaching career After the war, Bowerman returned to his position at Medford High School. Bowerman's third son, Tom, was born May 20, 1946. The family then moved to Eugene where he became the head track coach at his alma mater, the University of Oregon, on July 1, 1948. =University of Oregon= Bowerman's \\"Men of Oregon\\" won 24 NCAA individual titles (with wins in 15 of the 19 events contested) and four NCAA team crowns (1962-1964-1965-1970), and posted 16 top-10 NCAA finishes in 24 years as head coach. His teams also boasted 33 Olympians, 38 conference champions and 64 All-Americans. At the dual level, the Ducks posted a 114‚Äì20 record and went undefeated in 10 seasons. In addition, Bowerman coached the world record setting relay team in 1962. This team consisted of Archie San Romani, Dyrol Burleson, Vic Reeve, and Keith Forman with a time of 16:08.9. Six years later, another Oregon team of Roscoe Divine, Wade Bell, Arne Kvalheim and Dave Wilborn improved the record to 16:05.0. Among athletes that Bowerman coached are: Otis Davis, Steve Prefontaine, Kenny Moore, Bill Dellinger, Mac Wilkins, Jack Hutchins, Dyrol Burleson, Harry Jerome, Sig Ohlemann, Les Tipton, Gerry Moro, Wade Bell, Dave Edstrom, Roscoe Divine, Matt Centrowitz, Arne Kvalheim, Jim Grelle, Bruce Mortenson and Phil Knight. Bowerman disliked being called a coach; he saw himself as more of a teacher. He expected his squad to excel in the classroom, and urged his charges to apply the lessons they learned on the track to everyday life. In 1972, Bowerman stepped back from day-to-day coaching activities to conduct fundraising for renovating the Hayward Field grandstands that would be necessary for the consideration of hosting the Montreal Olympic Trials. He also ran unsuccessfully for a House\\"Poll check adds 1 vote\\" [election vote recount] (December 15, 1970). The Oregonian, p. 18. seat in the Oregon Legislature in 1970 as a Republican, losing by only 815 votes out of 61,000 cast. According to the Eugene Register-Guard newspaper, Bowerman officially retired as the University of Oregon head coach on March 23, 1973, and was succeeded by assistant coach Bill Dellinger. =United States Olympic Track program= Bowerman created a training program for adjusting athletes for the high altitude that they would experience at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games. This successful program led to his selection as the 1972 Munich Olympic Track and Field head coaching position, even though American miler favorite Jim Ryan lost to Kenyan Kip Keno citing attitude as part of the reason for this upset Bowerman coached members of teams from Norway, Canada, Australia, and the United States. During the Munich Massacre in the 1972 Munich Olympics, where Bowerman was frequently blamed for a dismal performance by the US Track Team, Israeli Olympic racewalker Shaul Ladany escaped the PLO terrorists, and then awakened Bowerman and alerted the German police. Bowerman called for the U.S. Marines to come and protect American Olympians swimmer Mark Spitz and javelin thrower Bill Schmidt. Running During a trip to New Zealand in 1962, Bowerman was introduced to the concept of running as a fitness routine, including people of an advanced age, through a running club organized by his friend and coaching colleague Arthur Lydiard. Bowerman brought this concept back to the United States, and began to write articles and books about running. He also created a running program in Eugene that became a national model for fitness programs. A Jogger's Manual, a three- page guide, was published shortly after Bowerman returned from New Zealand. In 1966, along with cardiologist W.E. Harris, Bowerman published a 90-page book titled Jogging. The book sold over a million copies and was credited with igniting the jogging phenomenon in the United States. The new crop of older athletic people contributed to the evolution of the sport of track and field to create a new division for these masters athletes. Due to the popularity of Jogging, Harris and Bowerman published a 127-page book in 1967. Athletics West is an American running team formed by Bill Bowerman, Phil Knight and Geoff Hollister in 1977. At the time, America had no definitive running program for young athletes to continue competing outside of college. The formation and success of Athletics West, together with the success and popularity of American runners like Craig Virgin (charter member), Steve Prefontaine, Frank Shorter and Bill Rodgers helped inspire the 1970s running boom. Nike According to Otis Davis, a student athlete who Bowerman coached at the University of Oregon, who later went on to win two gold medals at the 1960 Summer Olympics, He was one of the Guinea Pigs legendary coach Bill Bowerman customized shoes for prior to being a cofounder of Nike. Davis states ‚ÄòI didn't like the way they felt on my feet. There was no support and they were too tight. But I saw Bowerman make them from the waffle iron, and they were mine.\\" In 1964, Bowerman entered into a handshake agreement with Phil Knight, who had been a miler under him in the 1950s, to start an athletic footwear distribution company called Blue Ribbon Sports, later known as Nike, Inc. Knight managed the business end of the partnership, while Bowerman experimented with improvements in athletic footwear design. Bowerman stayed in Eugene, keeping his coaching job at the University of Oregon, while Knight operated the main office from Portland. Bowerman and Knight initially began importing the Onitsuka Tiger running shoes from Japan to sell in the United States. Initially, the partnership was 50-50, but shortly afterwards Bowerman wanted it changed to 51-49, with Knight having the higher ownership. He did this to avoid potential gridlock and have one of them be in charge of final decisions. Bowerman's design ideas led to the creation of a running shoe in 1966 that would ultimately be named \\"Nike Cortez\\" in 1968, which quickly became a top-seller and remains one of Nike's most iconic footwear designs. Bowerman designed several Nike shoes, but is best known for ruining his wife's Belgian waffle iron in 1970 or 1971, experimenting with the idea of using waffle-ironed rubber to create a new sole for footwear that would grip but be lightweight. Bowerman's design inspiration led to the introduction of the so- called \\"Moon Shoe\\" in 1972, so named because the waffle tread was said to resemble the footprints left by astronauts on the moon. Further refinement resulted in the \\"Waffle Trainer\\" in 1974, which helped fuel the explosive growth of Blue Ribbon Sports/Nike. While Bowerman was experimenting with shoe design, he worked in a small, unventilated space, using glue and solvents with toxic components that caused him severe nerve damage. The nerve damage to his lower legs left him with significant mobility problems; as Kenny Moore notes in his book Bowerman and the Men of Oregon, Bowerman had rendered himself unable to run in the shoes that he had given the world.Moore, p. 383ff Bowerman was obsessed with shaving weight off his athletes' running shoes. He believed that custom-made shoes would weigh less on the feet of his runners and cut down on blisters, as well as reduce the overall drag on their energy for every ounce he could remove from the shoe. By his estimation, removing one ounce (28 g) from a shoe, based on a six-foot gait for a runner, would translate in a reduction of 55 pounds (25 kg) of lift over a one-mile (1.6 km) span. Knight once said of Bowerman's importance to the company, \\"If coach (Bowerman) isn't happy, Nike isn't happy.\\"Phil Knight (2016). \\"Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike\\" Bowerman reduced his role with the company in the late 1970s and began passing down his stake in the company to other employees shortly before the IPO launched. Legacy Bowerman is a member of the National Distance Running Hall of Fame, the USA National Track and Field Hall of Fame, the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame, Oregon's Athletic Hall of Fame, the RRCA Distance Running Hall of Fame, and the National Inventors Hall of Fame. His statue, holding a stopwatch, graces the northwest corner of Hayward Field, home of the Prefontaine Classic at the University of Oregon. A biographical film, Without Limits, about the relationship between record- breaking distance runner Steve Prefontaine and his coach Bill Bowerman was made in 1998, and Bill Bowerman was played by Donald Sutherland. The headquarters for Nike is located on Bowerman Drive in homage to the company's co-founder. Also in his honor, the company created the \\"Bowerman Series\\" of performance running shoes, designed to provide longer-lasting, more training- focused products to compete with such running brands as Asics and Saucony. In 2009, the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association created The Bowerman, an award that is given to the most outstanding collegiate male and female track & field athlete in a given calendar year. Inaugural winners of the award were Oregon's Galen Rupp and Colorado's Jenny Barringer. The Bowerman trophy was designed by Tinker Hatfield, a Nike employee and former Oregon student-athlete coached by Bowerman.

Szemer√©di's regularity lemma is one of the most powerful tools in extremal graph theory, particularly in the study of large dense graphs. It states that the vertices of every large enough graph can be partitioned into a bounded number of parts so that the edges between different parts behave almost randomly. According to the lemma, no matter how large a graph is, we can approximate it with the edge densities between a bounded number of parts. Between any two parts, the distribution of edges will be pseudorandom as per the edge density. These approximations provide essentially correct values for various properties of the graph, such as the number of embedded copies of a given subgraph or the number of edge deletions required to remove all copies of some subgraph.  Statement  To state Szemer√©di's regularity lemma formally, we must formalize what the edge distribution between parts behaving 'almost randomly' really means. By 'almost random', we're referring to a notion called -regularity. To understand what this means, we first state some definitions. In what follows is a graph with vertex set . > Definition 1. Let be disjoint subsets of . The edge density of the pair is > defined as: :d(X,Y) := \\\\frac{\\\\left E(X,Y) \\\\right}{XY} where denotes > the set of edges having one end vertex in and one in . Subset pairs of a regular pair are similar in edge density to the original pair. We call a pair of parts -regular if, whenever you take a large subset of each part, their edge density isn't too far off the edge density of the pair of parts. Formally, > Definition 2. For , a pair of vertex sets and is called -regular, if for all > subsets , satisfying , , we have :\\\\left d(X,Y) - d(A,B) \\\\right \\\\le > \\\\varepsilon. The natural way to define an -regular partition should be one where each pair of parts is -regular. However, some graphs, such as the half graphs, require many pairs of partitions (but a small fraction of all pairs) to be irregular. So we shall define -regular partitions to be one where most pairs of parts are -regular. > Definition 3. A partition of V into k sets \\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\\\\\{V_1,\\\\ldots,V_k\\\\\\\\} > is called an \\\\varepsilon-regular partition if :\\\\sum_{(V_i,V_j)\\\\text{ not > }\\\\varepsilon\\\\text{-regular}} V_iV_j\\\\leq\\\\varepsilonV(G)^2 Now we can state the lemma: > Szemer√©di's Regularity Lemma. For every and positive integer there exists an > integer such that if is a graph with at least vertices, there exists an > integer in the range and an -regular partition of the vertex set of into > sets. The bound for the number of parts in the partition of the graph given by the proofs of Szemeredi's regularity lemma is very large, given by a -level iterated exponential of . At one time it was hoped that the true bound was much smaller, which would have had several useful applications. However found examples of graphs for which does indeed grow very fast and is at least as large as a -level iterated exponential of . In particular the best bound has level exactly 4 in the Grzegorczyk hierarchy, and so is not an elementary recursive function.. Proof The boundaries of irregularity witnessing subsets refine each part of the partition. We shall find an Œµ-regular partition for a given graph following an algorithm. A rough outline: # Start with an arbitrary partition (could just be 1 part) # While the partition isn't Œµ-regular: #*Find the subsets which witness Œµ-irregularity for each irregular pair. #*Simultaneously refine the partition using all the witnessing subsets. We apply a technique called the energy increment argument to show that this process terminates after a bounded number of steps. Basically, we define a monovariant which must increase by a certain amount in each step, but it's bounded above and thus cannot increase indefinitely. This monovariant is called 'energy' as it's an L^2 quantity. > Definition 4. Let be subsets of . Set V = n . The energy of the pair is > defined as: :q(U,W) := \\\\frac{UW}{n^2}d(U,W)^2 For partitions > \\\\mathcal{P}_U=\\\\\\\\{U_1,\\\\ldots,U_k\\\\\\\\} of and \\\\mathcal{P}_W = > \\\\\\\\{W_1,\\\\ldots,W_l\\\\\\\\} of , we define the energy to be the sum of the > energies between each pair of parts: :q(\\\\mathcal{P}_U,\\\\mathcal{P}_W) := > \\\\sum_{i=1}^k\\\\sum_{j=1}^lq(U_i,W_j) Finally, for a partition > \\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\\\\\{V_1,\\\\ldots,V_k\\\\\\\\} of , define the energy of \\\\mathcal{P} to be > q(\\\\mathcal{P},\\\\mathcal{P}). Specifically, > :q(\\\\mathcal{P})=\\\\sum_{i=1}^k\\\\sum_{j=1}^kq(V_i,V_j)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^k\\\\sum_{j=1}^k\\\\frac{V_iV_j}{n^2}d(V_i,V_j)^2 Observe that energy is between 0 and 1 because edge density is bounded above by 1: :q(\\\\mathcal{P})=\\\\sum_{i=1}^k\\\\sum_{j=1}^k\\\\frac{V_iV_j}{n^2}d(V_i,V_j)^2\\\\leq\\\\sum_{i=1}^k\\\\sum_{j=1}^k\\\\frac{V_iV_j}{n^2}=1 Now, we start by proving that energy does not decrease upon refinement. > Lemma 1.

Now, if \\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\\\\\{V_1,\\\\ldots,V_m\\\\\\\\}, applying Lemma 1 to each pair (V_i,V_j) proves that for every refinement \\\\mathcal{P'} of \\\\mathcal{P}, q(\\\\mathcal{P'}) \\\\ge q(\\\\mathcal{P}). Thus the refinement step in the algorithm doesn't lose any energy. > Lemma 2.

By lemma 2, the above sum is at least : > \\\\sum_{(i,j)\\\\in[k]^2}q(V_i,V_j)+\\\\sum_{(V_i,V_j)\\\\text{ not > }\\\\varepsilon\\\\text{-regular}}\\\\varepsilon^4\\\\frac{V_iV_j}{n^2} But the > second sum is at least \\\\varepsilon^5 since \\\\mathcal{P} is not \\\\varepsilon- > regular, so we deduce the desired inequality. \\\\square Now, starting from any partition, we can keep applying Lemma 3 as long as the resulting partition isn't \\\\varepsilon-regular. But in each step energy increases by \\\\varepsilon^5, and it's bounded above by 1. Then this process can be repeated at most \\\\varepsilon^{-5} times, before it terminates and we must have an \\\\varepsilon-regular partition.  Applications  If we have enough information about the regularity of a graph, we can count the number of copies of a specific subgraph within the graph up to small error. > Graph Counting Lemma. Let H be a graph with V(H)=[k], and let \\\\varepsilon>0. > Let G be an n-vertex graph with vertex sets V_1,\\\\dots,V_k\\\\subseteq V(G) such > that (V_i,V_j) is \\\\varepsilon-regular whenever \\\\\\\\{i,j\\\\\\\\}\\\\in E(H). Then, the > number of labeled copies of H in G is within e(H)\\\\varepsilonV_1\\\\cdotsV_k > of :\\\\left(\\\\prod_{\\\\\\\\{i,j\\\\\\\\}\\\\in > E(H)}d(V_i,V_j)\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\prod_{i=1}^kV_i\\\\right) This can be combined with Szemer√©di's regularity lemma to prove the Graph removal lemma. The graph removal lemma can be used to prove Roth's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, and a generalization of it, the hypergraph removal lemma, can be used to prove Szemer√©di's theorem. The graph removal lemma generalizes to induced subgraphs, by considering edge edits instead of only edge deletions. This was proved by Alon, Fischer, Krivelevich, and Szegedy in 2000. However, this required a stronger variation of the regularity lemma. Szemer√©di's regularity lemma does not provide meaningful results in sparse graphs. Since sparse graphs have subconstant edge densities, \\\\varepsilon- regularity is trivially satisfied. Even though the result seems purely theoretical, some attempts have been made to use the regularity method as compression technique for large graphs.  History and Extensions  Gowers's construction for the lower bound of Szemer√©di's regularity lemma first introduced a weaker version of this lemma, restricted to bipartite graphs, in order to prove Szemer√©di's theorem,. and in he proved the full lemma.. Extensions of the regularity method to hypergraphs were obtained by R√∂dl and his collaborators... and Gowers... J√°nos Koml√≥s, G√°bor S√°rk√∂zy and Endre Szemer√©di later (in 1997) proved in the blow-up lemma that the regular pairs in Szemer√©di regularity lemma behave like complete bipartite graphs under the correct conditions. The lemma allowed for deeper exploration into the nature of embeddings of large sparse graphs into dense graphs. The first constructive version was provided by Alon, Duke, Lefmann, R√∂dl and Yuster. Subsequently, Frieze and Kannan gave a different version and extended it to hypergraphs. They later produced a different construction due to Alan Frieze and Ravi Kannan that uses singular values of matrices. One can find more efficient non- deterministic algorithms, as formally detailed in Terence Tao's blog and implicitly mentioned in various papers. An inequality of Terence Tao extends the Szemer√©di regularity lemma, by revisiting it from the perspective of probability theory and information theory instead of graph theory.. Terence Tao has also provided a proof of the lemma based on spectral theory, using the adjacency matrices of graphs. It is not possible to prove a variant of the regularity lemma in which all pairs of partition sets are regular. Some graphs, such as the half graphs, require many pairs of partitions (but a small fraction of all pairs) to be irregular. It is a common variant in the definition of an \\\\varepsilon-regular partition to require that the vertex sets all have the same size, while collecting the leftover vertices in an \\"error\\"-set V_0 whose size is at most an \\\\varepsilon-fraction of the size of the vertex set of G. A stronger variation of the regularity lemma was proven by Alon, Fischer, Krivelevich, and Szegedy while proving the induced graph removal lemma. This works with a sequence of \\\\varepsilon instead of just one, and shows that there exists a partition with an extremely regular refinement, where the refinement doesn't have too large of an energy increment. Szemer√©di's regularity lemma can be interpreted as saying that the space of all graphs is totally bounded (and hence precompact) in a suitable metric (the cut distance). Limits in this metric can be represented by graphons; another version of the regularity lemma simply states that the space of graphons is compact. References Further reading *. *.

Chess equipment often accompanying a chess set are a chess box, chess clock and chess table. Chess sets are made in a wide variety of styles, often for ornamental rather than practical purposes. For tournament play, the Staunton chess set is preferred or required. Human chess uses people as the pieces. Blindfold chess may be played without any set at all.

Themed designs are generally intended for display purposes rather than actual play . Some works of art are designs of chess sets, such as the modernist chess set by chess enthusiast and dadaist Man Ray, that is on display in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.Man Ray set Chess pieces used for play are usually figurines that are taller than they are wide. For example, a set of pieces designed for a chessboard with squares typically have a king around tall. Chess sets are available in a variety of designs, with the most well-known Staunton design, named after Howard Staunton, a 19th-century English chess player, and designed by Nathaniel Cooke. The first Staunton style sets were made in 1849 by Jaques of London (also known as John Jaques of London and Jaques and Son of London) . Wooden White chess pieces are normally made of a light wood, boxwood, or sometimes maple. Black wooden pieces are made of a dark wood such as rosewood, ebony, red sandalwood, African Padauk wood (African padauk which is similar to red sandalwood and is marketed as Bud Rosewood or Blood Red Rosewood) or walnut. Sometimes they are made of boxwood and stained or painted black, brown, or red. Plastic white pieces are made of white or off-white plastic, and plastic black pieces are made of black or red plastic. Sometimes other materials are used, such as bone, ivory, or a composite material . For actual play, pieces of the Staunton chess set design are standard. The height of the king should be between . United States Chess Federation rules call for a king height between . A height of about is preferred by most players. The diameter of the king should be 40‚Äì50% of its height. The size of the other pieces should be in proportion to the king. The pieces should be well balanced such that their center of gravity is closer to the board. This is done by adding weights such as iron studs or lead blocks at the bottom and felted. It makes the pieces bottom-heavy and keeps them from toppling easily (a well-weighted piece should come upright even if tilted 60 degrees off vertical axis). This helps in blitz games as the speed of movement doesn't offer enough time or precision in dropping the pieces onto the intended squares. The length of each side of the squares on the chessboard should be about 1.25‚Äì1.3 times the diameter of the base of the king, or . Squares of about are normally well suited for pieces with the kings in the preferred size range. These criteria are from the United States Chess Federation's Official Rules of Chess, which is based on the F√©d√©ration Internationale des √âchecs rules . The grandmaster Larry Evans offered this advice on buying a set : > Make sure the one you buy is easy on the eye, felt-based, and heavy > (weighted). The men should be constructed so they don't come apart. ... The > regulation board used by the U. S. Chess Federation is green and buff‚Äînever > red and black. However, there are several good inlaid wood boards on the > market. ... Avoid cheap equipment. Chess offers a lifetime of enjoyment for > just a few dollars well spent at the outset.  Pocket and travel sets  Some small magnetic sets, designed to be compact and/or for travel, have pieces more like those used in shogi and xiangqi ‚Äì each piece being a similar flat token, with a symbol printed on it to identify the piece type.  Computer images  On computers, chess pieces are often 2D symbols on a 2D board, although some programs have 3D graphics engines with more traditional designs of chess pieces.

He competed in the 5,000 m at the 1956, 1960 and 1964 Olympics and won a bronze medal in 1964, setting his personal record.Bill Dellinger . sports-reference.com He lettered in track at the University of Oregon in 1954, 1955, and 1956. Coaching career Upon retirement from competition, Dellinger took a position as the assistant coach to Bill Bowerman for the Oregon Ducks track and field team. After Bowerman's retirement in 1972, Dellinger succeeded him as head coach. In his 25 years of coaching, Dellinger's men won five NCAA titles, achieved 108 All American honors, and had a 134-29 meet record. He was instrumental in the development and coaching of Oregon and American great distance star Steve Prefontaine in conjunction with Bowerman, and their experience was made into a 1997 film Prefontaine, in which Bill Dellinger was played by Ed O'Neill. In Co-Operation with Adidas, Dellinger developed the so called \\"Dellinger Web\\", a Cushioning Technology used on various Shoes throughout the 80s and early 90s. Dellinger also coached many post-collegians including Olympians Mary Decker, Bill McChesney (athlete), Alberto Salazar, Matt Centrowitz, Don Clary, and many others. After retiring from coaching Dellinger retired from the University of Oregon in 1998 and would later join his mentor, Bill Bowerman, as an inductee in the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2001.

Gustav was born in Cologne to Nicolaus August Otto, the founder of N. A. Otto & Cie. and inventor of the four-stroke internal combustion engine. It is therefore regarded that his interest in engines, specifically aircraft and the manufacture thereof, was something he inherited from his father at an early age.  Early life  Gustav Otto was regarded as successful and career-minded, and moved in elevated social circles. He attended higher secondary school in Cologne, and had internships at machine tool manufacturers. Later, he attended the Technical Colleges in Hanover, Karlsruhe and Munich for further engineering study.BMW Historical Archives, www.bmwgroup.com He is believed to have remained in Munich after completing his studies to co-found the Bayerische Auto-Garage company. Gustav had a difficult time getting out from under his father's long shadow. He was prone to bouts of depression, which affected his work.Kiley, D. \\"Driven:Inside BMW, the Most Admired Car Company in the World\\" p.53; Wiley 2004  Passion for Flight  Otto with an Otto A.G.O. (Aeromotor Gustav Otto) aeroengine Otto successfully raced cars and motorcycles in various competitive events. He was also very active in the earliest days of aviation. On 10 April 1910 he obtained his pilot's licence on an Aviatik biplane (also he took over an agency for this aircraft). He founded the Aeroplanbau Otto-Alberti workshop (renamed Gustav Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik in 1911) at the Puchheim airfield. In 1910, Gustav designed and built a biplane which created a sensation throughout Germany. Otto, along with a few others, flew machines made of wood, wire, canvas and powered by Daimler aeroengines. Through their passion for flying machines, they helped transform aviation from a do-it-yourself hobby to an industry vital to the military, especially after the breakout of World War I. Otto founded several companies for the purpose of building aircraft. For his first company, the following entry was recorded in the Munich Company Register under the number 14/364 on 15 March 1911: \\"Gustav Otto in Munich, Flugmaschinenfabrik (aircraft factory), Office Karlstrasse 72\\". Shortly afterwards, Otto moved the workshop from its original location at 37, Gabelsberger Strasse to its new premises at 135, Schleissheimer Strasse, and in 1913 started to construct a new factory at 76, Neulerchenfeldstrasse (later Lerchenauer Stra√üe) at the Oberwiesenfeld (the business was renamed \\"Otto-Werke\\" in 1915).Munich Public Records Otto sold over 30 aircraft through his company, which also included a flight school. Ernst Udet, the second- highest scoring German flying ace of World War I (after Manfred von Richthofen), earned his pilot's license after private training with Otto.Wikipedia Ernst Udet  The foundation of BMW  Otto Flugzeugwerke 1914 In 1913, after selling 47 aircraft to the Bavarian Army, Otto opened a factory Otto-Flugzeugwerke on Lerchenauer Strasse just east of the Oberwiesenfeld troop manoeuvre area in the Milbertshofen district of Munich (this area later became Munich's first airport). He wanted to be closer to the German government's procurement process for military sale. However, he was not skilled at the politics and payoffs necessary when dealing with the Bavarian war ministry and Prussian Army. Unable to navigate these politics while leaving his pride and integrity intact deeply troubled him. Biplane from Otto Flugzeugwerke Shortly after 1914, Otto established another company named AGO Flugzeugwerke at Berlin's Johannisthal Air Field. The name \\"AGO\\" stood for either Actien-Gesellschaft Otto or Aerowerke Gustav Otto - there seems to be some ambiguity - but during the early years of World War I the company mostly licence-built Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik designs (as did Pfalz Flugzeugwerke). Otto's designs were initially successful, but constantly plagued with problems related to cost-effective production, and revenue. At the start of the war, Otto-Flugzeugwerke was supplying the German Air Force, but the production problems ended up being so great that government agencies urged the company to solve the issues. The stress of wartime seemed to prove too great a burden for Otto who suffered health issues which led to financial problems with the company: In 1915 he was admitted to a Munich mental hospital for treatment of depression. During his treatment, the company languished to the brink of bankruptcy. Eventually, Otto was forced to resign and was offered a buyout that would compensate him for the business and also cover his medical bills. The assets were finally taken over by a consortium which incorporated them into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke on 19 February 1916. Otto therefore no longer had a stake in this company and instead turned his interest to a just previously founded (1 February 1916) independent Otto-Werke Flugzeug- und Maschinenfabrik GmbH. After the First World War, Otto started a new attempt at car manufacturing with the Starnberger Automobilwerke. The luxury Otto- Mercedes car built there is alleged to have been well received abroad. In 1924 Otto was divorced from his wife Ada. He suffered badly from the emotional ordeal. Ada remarried, but in August 1925 died under mysterious circumstances that gave rise to much speculation. Although no longer married to her, Otto took her death most harshly and apparently fell into a deep depression. In 1926, amid failed attempts at business (caused by various reasons), the death of his wife, and health issues, Otto committed suicide at the age of 43 in Munich.

The divalent organic ligand coordinated to the metal center is called a carbene. Carbene complexes for almost all transition metals have been reported. Many methods for synthesizing them and reactions utilizing them have been reported. The term carbene ligand is a formalism since many are not derived from carbenes and almost none exhibit the reactivity characteristic of carbenes. Described often as M=CR2, they represent a class of organic ligands intermediate between alkyls (‚àíCR3) and carbynes (‚â°CR). They feature in some catalytic reactions, especially alkene metathesis, and are of value in the preparation of some fine chemicals.  Classification  Metal carbene complexes are often classified into two types. The Fischer carbenes named after Ernst Otto Fischer feature strong œÄ-acceptors at the metal and being electrophilic at the carbene carbon atom. Schrock carbenes, named after Richard R. Schrock, are characterized by more nucleophilic carbene carbon centers, these species typically feature higher valent metals. N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) were popularlized following Arduengo's isolation of a stable free carbene in 1991. Reflecting the growth of the area, carbene complexes are now known with a broad range of different reactivities and diverse substituents. Often it is not possible to classify a carbene complex with regards to its electrophilicity or nucleophilicity. =Fischer carbenes= Fischer carbenes are found with: * low oxidation state metal center * middle and late transition metals Fe(0), Mo(0), Cr(0) * œÄ-acceptor metal ligands * œÄ-donor substituents on the carbene atom such as alkoxy and alkylated amino groups. The chemical bonding (Scheme 1) is based on œÉ-type electron donation of the filled lone pair orbital of the carbene atom to an empty metal d-orbital, and œÄ back bonding of a filled metal d-orbital to the empty p-orbital on carbon. An example is the complex (CO)5Cr=C(NR2)Ph. Fischer carbenes can be likened to ketones, with the carbene carbon being electrophilic, much like the carbonyl carbon of a ketone. Like ketones, Fischer carbene species can undergo aldol-like reactions. The hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon Œ± to the carbene carbon are acidic, and can be deprotonated by a base such as n-butyllithium, to give a nucleophile which can undergo further reaction. This carbene is the starting material for other reactions such as the Wulff-D√∂tz reaction. =Schrock carbenes= Schrock carbenes do not have œÄ-accepting ligands. These complexes are nucleophilic at the carbene carbon atom. Schrock carbenes are typically found with: * high oxidation state metal center * early transition metals Ti(IV), Ta(V) * œÄ-donor ligands * hydrogen and alkyl substituents on carbenoid carbon. Bonding in such complexes can be viewed as the coupling of a triplet state metal and triplet carbene. These bonds are polarized towards carbon and therefore the carbene atom is a nucleophile. An example of a Schrock carbene is the compound Ta(=C(H)But)(CH2But)3, with a tantalum(V) center doubly bonded to a neopentylidene ligand as well as three neopentyl ligands. An example of interest in organic synthesis is Tebbe's reagent. =N-Heterocyclic carbenes= :IMes is a common NHC ligand. N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are particularly common carbene ligands. They are popular because they are more readily prepared than Schrock and Fischer carbenes. In fact many NHCs are isolated as the free ligand, since they are persistent carbenes. Being strongly stabilized by œÄ-donating substituents, NHCs are powerful œÉ-donors but œÄ-bonding with the metal is weak. For this reason, the bond between the carbon and the metal center is often represented by a single dative bond, whereas Fischer and Schrock carbenes are usually depicted with double bonds to metal. Continuing with this analogy, NHCs are often compared with trialkylphosphine ligands. Like phosphines, NHCs serve as spectator ligands that influence catalysis through a combination of electronic and steric effects, but they do not directly bind substrates. Carbenes without a metal ligand have been produced in the lab. =Carbene radicals= Carbene radicals are long-lived reaction intermediates found with: * low oxidation state metal center with singly occupied dz2 orbital * middle and late transition metal, e.g. Co(II) * œÉ-donor and œÄ-acceptor ligand * œÄ-acceptor substituents on the ligand such as carbonyl or sulfonyl groups. The chemical bond present in carbene radicals is described as aspects of both Fischer and Schrock carbenes. Bonding Scheme of Carbene Radical Complexes as compared to Schrock and Fischer-type carbene complexes Applications of carbene complexes The main applications of metal carbenes involves none of the above classes of compounds, but rather heterogeneous catalysts used for alkene metathesis in the Shell higher olefin process. A variety of related reactions are used to interconvert light alkenes, e.g. butenes, propylene, and ethylene. Carbene-complexes are invoked as intermediates in the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch route to hydrocarbons. A variety of soluble carbene reagents, especially the Grubbs' and molybdenum-imido catalysts have been applied to laboratory-scale synthesis of natural products and materials science. In the nucleophilic abstraction reaction, a methyl group can be abstracted from a Fischer carbene for further reaction. Diazo compounds like methyl phenyldiazoacetate can be used for cyclopropanation or to insert into C-H bonds of organic substrates. These reactions are catalyzed by dirhodium tetraacetate or related chiral derivatives. Such catalysis is assumed to proceed via the intermediacy of carbene complexes. History :Chugaev's red salt, was not recognized as such until decades after its preparation. The characterization of (CO)5W(COCH3(Ph)) in the 1960s is often cited as the starting point of the area, although carbenoid ligands had been previously implicated. Ernst Otto Fischer, for this and other achievements in organometalic chemistry, was awarded the 1973 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Overview Intersection of 5th St. and Aspen St. NW, Takoma, February 2019 Takoma is a diverse neighborhood, populated mostly by middle-class families. Its small downtown has recently been redeveloped, bringing in new residents and attractive new businesses. Many of the houses in Takoma are historic, and some are over 100 years old. Takoma and the rest of Ward 4 are represented in the Council of the District of Columbia by Brandon Todd. Geography Map of Washington, D.C., with Takoma highlighted in red Along Eastern Avenue, Takoma borders Takoma Park, Maryland, a city with which Takoma shares its origins. Takoma shares a common identity with the neighboring city in Maryland, and the downtown area surrounding the Takoma Metro station crosses the District of Columbia line. Takoma is bounded by Georgia Avenue to the west, somewhere between Tuckerman and Van Buren Streets to the south, and Eastern Avenue to the northeast. The current site of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Georgia Avenue separates it from Rock Creek Park. However, the neighborhood historically and culturally spans across the Maryland line into the greater neighborhood of Takoma Park. History Takoma, which was originally named Takoma Park, was developed in 1883 by developer Benjamin Franklin Gilbert as a commuter suburb on the Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad line. Gilbert welcomed the Seventh- day Adventist Church to set up their world headquarters and publishing house in Takoma Park, D.C. with a hospital and college in neighboring Takoma Park, Maryland, and promoted the community's reputation for vegetarianism and \\"clean living\\" away from the \\"malarial swamps\\" of the city. Takoma, D.C. was originally regarded as the commercial hub for the entire surrounding area, prior to the development of Silver Spring, Maryland, as it featured large shops and industrial buildings in the area now occupied by the Metro station. Its commercial hub is considered to be part of Takoma Park's Historic District. Takoma was originally the name of Mount Rainier, from Lushootseed (earlier ), \\"snow-covered mountain\\". Gilbert wished to rename the train stop called Brightwood, and the name Takoma was chosen in 1883 by D.C. resident Ida Summy, who believed it to mean \\"high up\\" or \\"near heaven\\". The Seventh-day Adventist Church maintained its world headquarters and a publishing house on the Eastern Avenue side of the D.C. line until the early 1980s; after moving to Silver Spring, the former site of the publishing house became art lofts and rehearsal space for the Washington Opera. The Takoma Theater, built in 1924, is located in the neighborhood and is supported by the Takoma Theatre Conservancy, a nonprofit preservation group that raised money to buy and refurbish the theater.Meno, Mike.Grants offer hope for Takoma Theatre renewal.

Both Takoma Park, D.C., and Takoma Park, Maryland, have been noted, regionally and nationally, for progressive politics dating from the 1960s, when area residents (led by future Takoma Park, MD mayor Sam Abbott) rallied to prevent a 10-lane freeway from bisecting the community, and lobbied to build the Metrorail system, near the site of the former B&O; railroad station around which the community had been built. However, much of the land adjacent to the station was demolished or neglected in the wake of the freeway controversy, creating division between downtown Takoma Park, Maryland, and the center of the Takoma community, which roughly parallels the D.C. line. Both of the remaining areas, on either side of the D.C.-Maryland line, are now protected as U.S. Historic Districts. Education District of Columbia Public Schools operates public schools.

The founders of Wild Earth were Dave Foreman and John Davis. That publication was associated with the environmental group Earth First!. In 1990, following increasingly acrimonious debate over the direction of Earth First!, the organization split and the original Journal folded.

Wild Earth differed strongly from the Earth First! Journal in that while the latter emphasized direct action and a style rooted in the counterculture, Wild Earth emphasized conservation biology, science, and wilderness proposals, and a style rooted in the conservationism movement. Wild Earth was published quarterly. At first, Wild Earth was solely a magazine. The publisher was Cenozoic Society, Inc. Later, a new environmental group, the Wildlands Project, was formed and the magazine became the official periodical of the Wildlands Project.

It operated as a pig iron-producing blast furnace from 1882 to 1971. After closing, it became one of the first industrial sites (and the only blast furnace) in the U.S. to be preserved and restored for public use. In 1981, the furnaces were designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior. and The site currently serves as an interpretive museum of industry and hosts a nationally recognized metal arts program. It also serves as a concert and festival venue. A new visitor center was built 2015 and opened in 2016. The furnace site, along a wide strip of land reserved in Birmingham's original city plan for railroads and industry, hosts thousands of students through their education programs per year. The museum is free to visit during their operating hours of Tuesday-Saturday 10:00 A.M to 4:00 P.M. and Sunday 12:00 to 4:00 P.M. History Colonel James Withers Sloss was one of the founders of Birmingham, helping to promote railroad development in Jones Valley, Alabama and participating in the Pratt Coke and Coal Company, one of the new city's first manufacturers. In 1881 he formed his own company, the Sloss Furnace Company, and began construction of Birmingham's first blast furnace on 50 acres (202,000 m¬≤) of land donated by the Elyton Land Company for industrial development. The engineer in charge of construction was Harry Hargreaves, a former student of English inventor Thomas Whitwell. The two Whitwell-type furnaces were 60 feet (18 m) tall and 18 feet (5.4 m) in diameter. The first blast was initiated in April 1882. The facility produced 24,000 tons of high quality iron during its first year of operation. Sloss iron won a bronze medal at the Southern Exposition held in 1883 at Louisville, Kentucky. In 1886 Sloss retired and sold the company to a group of investors who reorganized it in 1899 as the Sloss-Sheffield Steel and Iron Company. The group regularly utilized forced mainly African-American convict- laborers that were purchased in collusion with local sheriffs in a system called peonage. Sheriffs would arrest mainly African-American men under often bogus charges of ‚Äúvagrancy‚Äù and the Sloss company would purchase these men and work them as slaves. This allowed slavery to continue after the Civil War and amassed great wealth for Sloss. New blowers were installed in 1902, new boilers in 1906 and 1914 and the furnaces completely rebuilt with modern equipment between 1927 and 1929. In 1909 James Pickering Dovel had become the superintendent of construction. For the next 21 years, Sloss was Dovel's workshop for invention. He developed gas cleaning equipment, modified the design of the furnaces, and improved the linings of the furnaces. In all, some 17 patents are credited to Dovel. Sloss's No. 2 Furnace, rebuilt in 1927, included many of these inventions, earning Dovel and Sloss a national reputation for innovation.http://www.historicalmarkerproject.com/markers/HMTBK_the-gas- system_Birmingham-AL.html Through this aggressive campaign of modernization and expansion, including furnace and mining and quarrying operations all around Jefferson County, Sloss-Sheffield became the second largest seller of pig-iron in the district and among the largest in the world. During this period the company built 48 small cottages for black workers near the downtown furnace ‚Äî a community that became known as \\"Sloss Quarters\\" or just \\"the quarters\\". In 1952, the Sloss Furnaces were acquired by the U.S. Pipe and Foundry Company, and sold nearly two decades later in 1969 to the Jim Walter Corp. The Birmingham area had been suffering from a serious air pollution problem during the 1950s and 1960s due to the iron and steel industry there, and Federal legislation such as the U.S. Clean Air Act encouraged the closure of older and out-of-date smelting works. Also, by the early 1960s, higher- yielding brown ores from other regions were feeding the blast furnaces. The Jim Walter company closed the furnaces two years later, and then donated the property to the Alabama State Fair Authority for possible development as a museum of industry. The authority determined that redevelopment was not feasible and made plans to demolish the furnaces. Local preservationists formed the Sloss Furnace Association to lobby for preservation of this site, which is of central importance to the history of Birmingham. In 1976, the site was documented for the Historic American Engineering Record and its historic significance was detailed in a study commissioned by the city. Birmingham voters approved a $3.3 million bond issue in 1977 to preserve the site. This money went towards stabilization of the main structures and the construction of a visitors' center and the establishment of a metal arts program. The Sloss Furnaces site became a National Historic Landmark in 1981, and opened to the public as the nation's first and only 20th century blast furnace site preserved as a museum on Labor Day weekend, 1983. In February 2009 Sloss became the new home of the SLSF 4018 steam locomotive, which was relocated from Birmingham's Fair Park. Present use Visitors can walk through the remains of the Sloss Furnace Sloss is currently used to hold metal arts classes and events, food festivals, fun runs, education programs, weddings, and concerts. Being a reportedly haunted location, it is also rents the site to an outside company to create an annual Halloween haunted attraction. Sloss Furnaces holds Historic Night Tours to give visitors a chance to hear the darker history of Sloss. The story of Sloss' preservation and modern use was documented in Alabama Public Television's Sloss: Industry to Art. For many years Sloss Furnaces has been used as a haunted house attraction during the Halloween season. The event is termed \\"Fright Furnace at the Historic Sloss Furnaces\\". In June 2012 a formal groundbreaking ceremony was held at the site, signaling the beginning of construction on a new 16,000 square foot Visitors' and Education Center to be located on the south-west corner of the furnace site. The new complex, funded jointly by the City of Birmingham and the Sloss Foundation, hosts educational exhibits relevant to the site's history, administrative offices, as well as additional multi-purpose space for public events. The facility improvements are in line with an expected ongoing project within the city to construct new \\"greenway\\" spaces in the downtown area, possibly linking several popular city venues in the future. The paranormal claims of Sloss Furnances were featured in paranormal reality TV shows such as Ghost Adventures and Ghost Hunters.

Syntax, keywords, and grammatical conventions were the same as Java's. It was introduced in 1996 and discontinued in January 2004, replacing it to a certain extent with J# and C#.  J++ compared to Sun's Java implementation  While J++ conformed to the Java language specification, Microsoft did not implement certain features of the official Sun Java implementation in its Visual J++ product line. Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) and Java Native Interface (JNI) are such examples. In addition, J++ implemented other extensions that were not part of Sun's Java implementation. The inclusion of callbacks and delegates for event handling further contributed to defining J++ as a completely different language merely based on an already existing design concept. Furthermore, J++ applications did not conform to the standardized method of accessing the underlying operating system functions as any other Java application under Sun's Java SDK. In Microsoft's implementation, an underlying framework called J/Direct provided a base mechanism that allowed J++ applications to completely circumvent Java's class libraries and API in accessing the underlying operating system. Due to this short-cut around the original Java framework, J++ applications were more efficient in taking advantage of Win32 API functions than Java applications. J++ applications using these features could not be run on Sun's Java SDK, but the Kaffe project developed extensions which made it possible to run J++ applications with these features on their open sourced JVM. However, these extensions (implemented by TransVirtual under Microsoft funding) were not widely used, and J++ applications still needed to be compiled on Visual J++ before being able to be run by Kaffe. Visual J++ supported ActiveX.  The WFC  The Windows Foundation Classes (WFC) encapsulated the Microsoft Win32 platform API and DHTML object models into a unified class library. WFC was primarily designed for creating graphical user interfaces for Java applications on Windows.  Sun's litigation against Microsoft  Sun Microsystems had originally licensed Java to Microsoft but later initiated litigation against Microsoft for trademark violation. Sun's trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be \\"compatible\\". Some observers have remarked that this incompatibility appears to have been a deliberate aim of Microsoft's, in an attempt to at least slow the advance of Sun's Java technology. The failure of the MSJVM to pass Sun's compliance tests was a large factor in the initial lawsuit. On January 24, 2001, this and all other outstanding Sun‚ÄìMicrosoft lawsuits were settled as part of a wide- ranging agreement between Sun and Microsoft. As provided in the settlement, Microsoft could not incorporate into J++ features that Sun introduced into Java in versions beyond the one J++ had (at that date) been mirrored from; it would be frozen at the feature set of Java version 1.1.4. This effectively killed J++, and ended further updates. Microsoft was also forced to agree to cease distribution of the MSJVM; it is no longer available for download. The terms of the settlement did, however, permit Microsoft to provide security support, allowing further updates to the MSJVM to fix security holes and any other problems relating to security threats. Microsoft ceased such support for the MSJVM on December 31, 2007. The technology of J++ was eventually recycled, surviving for a while as part of the Microsoft .NET platform and the J# programming language.  Visual J++ ‚Äì the IDE  Visual J++ was also the name of the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for J++ and provided many tools and utilities to help J++ programmers fully leverage the Win32 API. Visual J++ is no longer available for distribution, but it was part of the Microsoft Visual Studio product line. Visual Studio 6.0 was the last release to include J++.  Visual J#  Visual J# (pronounced \\"Jay Sharp\\") is a Microsoft language whose syntax is close to Java, part of the .NET Framework. Visual J# is part of the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET product suite and is designed to help developers and programmers migrate from J++ (or Java) to the .NET Framework. Microsoft later developed the C# (\\"C Sharp\\") language as the primary language for the .NET platform, which was in many ways influenced by Java; subsequently the .NET Framework shares many ideas in common with Java. Much like Java, C# is compiled to a type of bytecode (called CIL), and runs on top of a virtual machine called the Common Language Runtime in .NET. Visual Studio 2005 was the last release to include J#.

BotCon has been held annually since 1994. BotCon is a syllabic abbreviation for \\"Robot Convention\\" but also refers to \\"Autobot\\" and \\"Decepticon\\", the protagonist and antagonist robot factions in the many continuities in the Transformers franchise. Featured BotCon guests are usually involved in the creation of Transformers media in some respect, whether as voice actors from the animated series, artists or writers from the comic books, or actual Hasbro employees. Fun Publications has held the convention for a number of years, with 2016 being its final year. It was replaced by HasCon, Hasbro's own convention, in 2017. History Display cases for upcoming Transformers at BotCon 2006 Cosplayers at BotCon Cosplay of the Combaticon Swindle at BotCon 2011. The first BotCon was held in Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States in 1994. Organized by brothers Jon and Karl Hartman, the convention had 180 attendees. BotCon was organized in 1995 by Raksha, a prominent figure in the fan community, and in 1996 by Men In Black Productions, headed up by Dennis Barger. In 1997, the Hartmans brought Glen Hallit, a fellow fan, into the fold, forming 3H Enterprises (based on the first letter of the organizers' last names). In 1999, BotCon Europe took place in Clapham Common, Wandsworth, South West London, England. At BotCon 2002, Hallit announced that 3H had secured the official Transformers convention license, as well as licenses to produce comic books and start a fan club. Shortly thereafter, the Hartmans were removed from their organizational duties, leaving Glen Hallit as the sole organizer of the new company, 3H Productions, Inc. In the winter of 2002, 3H sought to expand to Europe, holding an official European convention in Cheshunt, UK. However, the event, which was held in conjunction with the main BotCon 2002 in the US, had much less advertising and the registration did not open until a couple of weeks before the convention. Since the attendance at the European BotCon had been much smaller than the main show that summer, 3H decided it was too much work to hold two separate conventions, and officially announced that they would never hold BotCon outside the US again. In 2003, the convention changed its name to \\"The Official Transformers Collectors' Convention\\" (OTFCC), due to the Hartmans' ownership of the BotCon service mark. The fandom held dueling conventions in 2004, as 3H held OTFCC in Chicago, Illinois, while the Hartman brothers revived the BotCon name for their final convention in Pasadena, California. That fall, 3H Productions lost all of its Transformers-related licenses, leaving the convention in a state of limbo. In early January 2005, Hasbro announced on its official website that Fun Publications, owned by Brian Savage, had been awarded the convention and fan club licenses. The Hartman brothers and prominent fans Pete Sinclair, Benson Yee, and Rik Alvarez were invited to form an advisory council to help ease the transition of organizing the convention for the new owners. Once the Hartmans' service mark was transferred to Fun Publications, BotCon regained its status of being the official Transformers collectors' convention. On February 2, 2020, people started to observe new activity on the official Botcon website. On February 3, 2020 Karl Hartman announced Botcon 2021. In a post on the Official Botcon Facebook page, Hartman said, \\"The story of BotCon is not over. It just has a new chapter.

Hasbro selected the first four robot inductees, while fans worldwide voted for the fifth. In the end, Dinobot from Beast Wars: Transformers won the votes. Among the human inductees were Bob Budiansky for helping create the franchise through comics and personality profiles, Peter Cullen for giving Optimus Prime his voice, and Hideaki Yoke and Kohjin Ohno of Takara Tomy for creating many of the franchise's toys. For 2011, Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay were inducted for the success of the Transformers live-action film franchise. In 2012, the first posthumous award was given to voice actor Chris Latta, who died in 1994. Wheeljack, one of the characters he voiced in the original series, was selected as the Fan's Choice recipient. ;2010 :Robots: Optimus Prime, Megatron, Starscream, Bumblebee, Dinobot (Fan's Choice)Hasbro.com - Hall of Fame Robots :Humans: Bob Budiansky, Peter Cullen, Hideaki Yoke, Kohjin OhnoHasbro.com - Hall of Fame Humans ;2011 :Robots: Ironhide, Ratchet, Soundwave, Waspinator (Fan's Choice) :Humans: Steven Spielberg, Michael Bay ;2012 :Robots: Grimlock, Jazz, Shockwave, Wheeljack (Fan's Choice)TRANSFORMERS HALL OF FAME: A BRIEF HISTORY :Humans: Chris Latta, Simon Furman ;2013 :Robots: Megatron, Ultra Magnus (Fan's Choice) ;2014 :Robots: Arcee, Rodimus (Fan's Choice) :Humans: Stan Bush ;2015 :Robots: Prowl, Predaking (Fan's Choice) :Humans: Frank Welker, Vince DiCola ;2016 :Robots: Optimus Primal, Cosmos (Fan's Choice) :Humans: David Kaye, Judd Nelson, \\"Weird Al\\" YankovicHall of Fame with Judd Nelson and David Kaye plus Stan Bush and Vince DiCola in Concert Photogallery Exclusive toys One of BotCon's most popular features is the exclusive toys made available to the attendees. The toys are different every year and are not retailed anywhere in the world. The number of exclusive toys increased significantly in 2005 after Fun Publications became the official license holder of the convention. The identities and designs of the toys were originally kept a close secret until the opening of the convention, but in the later years of the convention the organizers often chose to reveal one or more of the exclusives ahead of time due to repeated problems with stolen prototypes being sold on eBay. In 2008, organizer Brian Savage ordered all eBay users selling these prototypes to return them to their rightful owners. Although the toys are always unique, financial costs prohibit the creation of entirely new molds. As such, the toys are redecos, repaints, or retools of previously used toys given new identities, occasionally switching allegiances and even gender. Beginning in 2003, some of the exclusives were given new, retooled heads to further differentiate the new characters from previous uses of a mold. As the number of exclusives offered at each convention grew, so did the number of retooled parts. Since then, it has been standard practice to produce three or four newly tooled heads (or other parts such as wings in the case of 2007) for each BotCon. After the convention, exclusive toys usually become valuable collector's items in the community, particularly among fans who missed the convention. The Transformers Collector's Club also releases exclusive figures, which are also remolds and repaints of regular Transformers figures.

The movie is a parody of Alien. It stars Leslie Nielsen in a role similar to those in the farcical comedies Airplane and Naked Gun. It co-stars Cindy Williams, Gerrit Graham, and Patrick Macnee. It was released on VHS in 1983 under the title Spaceship to emphasize Nielsen's connection to Airplane!, and released on DVD in 1999 under the title Naked Space to play up the connection to Nielsen's Naked Gun movies. The movie is a low-budget comedy with simple sets and dialogue wrapped around several musical numbers. In one of the scenes, the red slimy one-eyed alien monster performs a lounge-act style musical number called \\"I Want to Eat Your Face.\\" Williams performs two musical numbers, one solo and one with Kimmel, who had previously appeared with and directed Williams in 1976 in The First Nudie Musical. The film was completely re-edited by the producers - that is what was released as Spaceship/Naked Space on home video. The original version, The Creature Wasn't Nice, was only seen at two public previews. In 2019, it was announced that both versions of the film would come to home video under its original title.

This film was released by Touchstone Pictures and Spyglass Entertainment, in association with Triple Threat Talent, on April 14, 2000. The film is dedicated to Norton's late mother, Robin. It had a budget of $29 million. Plot Father Brian Finn (Edward Norton), dedicated to his calling as Catholic priest since childhood, shares the duties of his New York parish with the older Fr. Havel (Milo≈° Forman). Rabbi Jacob \\"Jake\\" Schram (Ben Stiller), best friends with Brian since they were children and the youngest rabbi at his synagogue, focuses on his work to the detriment of his private life, much to the chagrin of his mother, Ruth (Anne Bancroft). The two men show a close bond even in their professions, planning to open a jointly-sponsored community center. The pair reminisce about their childhood friend Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman), meeting them in middle school after beating up a bully. The three were close friends until Anna's family moved to California and they ultimately lost touch. Sixteen years later, Anna moves to New York for work and calls Jake and Brian out of the blue, rekindling their friendship. Anna and Jake begin sleeping together, but he is reluctant to become seriously involved as she is not Jewish, which could compromise his relationship with his congregation and his mother Ruth, who disowned her eldest son for marrying outside the faith. Between this conflict and their desire to spare Brian's feelings, the relationship is kept mostly secret. As the relationship continues, Jake remains unwilling to view the relationship as serious, despite Anna‚Äôs hints at her ‚Äòtaking a class‚Äô. She is upset when they run into members of Jake's congregation while on a date, and Jake introduces her only as \\"my old friend Anna\\". Brian is in private turmoil after also developing feelings for Anna, in conflict with his vows. He misinterprets Anna's words and actions ‚Äì some of which are subtle signals to Jake ‚Äì and even has an erotic dream about her. He seriously considers leaving the priesthood to pursue a romantic relationship with her. While the three have dinner with Ruth, she reveals to Anna that she knows about her and Jake's secret relationship. Jake and Brian walk in on the tearful moment, and Jake and Anna later argue over the religious issues complicating their romance and part ways. Anna calls Brian for comfort and he rushes to her, taking her tearful ramblings to be a confession of feelings for him. When he kisses her and confesses his love, she interrupts him, admitting she is in love with Jake and they have been seeing each other secretly for months. Embarrassed and rejected, Brian spends the night drinking on the streets. Still drunk the next day, Brian stumbles into Jake's temple and interrupts a post-bar mitzvah gathering, resulting in a confrontation with Jake that ends with the priest punching the rabbi. As the Community Center's grand opening approaches, along with the end of Anna's East Coast assignment, Jake reconciles with Brian, as does Anna soon after. A discussion with Brian prompts Jake to go to Anna's office building, with Brian shouting encouragement as he runs down the street. Interrupting Anna's going-away party, Jake gets her attention from a window across the street, and calls to explain himself and offer to set things right. That evening, they surprise Brian in the middle of his karaoke number at the interfaith center. Anna greets Rabbi Lewis (Eli Wallach) and mentions their meetings together, revealing that she had been taking classes to convert to Judaism.

The primary purpose of anointing with the holy anointing oil was to sanctify, to set the anointed person or object apart as qodesh, or \\"holy\\" (). Originally, the oil was used exclusively for the priests and the Tabernacle articles, but its use was later extended to include kings (). It was forbidden to be used on an outsider () or to be used on the body of any common person () and the Israelites were forbidden to duplicate any like it for themselves (). Some segments of Christianity have continued the practice of using holy anointing oil as a devotional practice, as well as in various liturgies. A number of religious groups have traditions of continuity of the holy anointing oil, with part of the original oil prepared by Moses remaining to this day, either supplemented by additional oil or miraculously increased as it is used.

The person thus anointed might be a king, a priest, or a prophet. = In the ancient Near East = Customs varied in the cultures of the Middle East. However, anointing with special oil in Israel was either a strictly priestly or kingly right. When a prophet was anointed, it was because he was first a priest. When a non-king was anointed, such as Elijah's anointing of Hazael and Jehu, it was a sign that Hazael was to become king of Aram (Syria) and Jehu was to become king of Israel.Roland De Vaux Les institutions de I 'ancien testament (Paris: Cerf, 1958); English 1965 - rep.

Spices and oils were chosen which assisted man in orienting himself and in creating a sense of safety as well as a sense of elevation above the physical world of decay. The sense of smell was also considered highly esteemed by deity. In Deuteronomy 4:28 and Psalms 115:5-6 the sense of smell is included in connection with the polemics against idols. In the Hebrew Bible God takes pleasure in inhaling the \\"soothing odor\\" (reah hannihoah) of offerings (Genesis 8:21 etc.).M.C.A. Korpel, A Rift in the Clouds, Ugaritic and Hebrew Descriptions of the Divine (Munster, 1990), pp. 99,105, 142, 419. To the ancient Israelite there was no oil or fat with more symbolic meaning than olive oil. It was used as an emollient, a fuel for lighting lamps, for nutrition, and for many other purposes. It was scented olive oil that was chosen to be a holy anointing oil for the Israelites. Identification of kaneh bosem While sources agree about the identity of four of the five ingredients of anointing oil, the identity of the fifth, \\"kaneh bosem\\", has been a matter of debate. The Bible indicates that it was an aromatic cane or grass, which was imported from a distant land by way of the spice routes, and that a related plant grows naturally in Israel. Several different plants have been named as possibly being the \\"kaneh bosem\\". =Acorus calamus= Most lexicographers, botanists, and biblical commentators translate keneh bosem as \\"cane balsam\\".Plants of the Bible - Page 40 Harold Norman Moldenke, Alma Lance Moldenke - 1952 \\"The Hebrew word involved is \\"keneh\\" (Ezekiel 27 : 19; Song 4 : 14) or, more fully, \\"keneh bosem\\", meaning \\"spiced or sweet cane\\" (Exodus 30: 23) or \\"keneh hattob\\" or \\"v'kaneh hatov\\", meaning \\"and the good cane\\" (Jeremiah 6: 20).\\" The Aramaic Targum Onkelos renders the Hebrew kaneh bosem in Aramaic as q'nei busma.Vernunft und alle Sinne: ine theologisch-√§sthetische Betrachtung ... - Page 122 Klaus R√∂hring - 2007 \\"Die creme- und rosafarbenen Bl√ºten mischen sich auch farblich in dieses duftende Bouquet, sodass die Augen mitriechen k√∂nnen und sollen.

This plant is known to botanists as Acorus calamus. According to Aryeh Kaplan in The Living Torah, \\"It appears that a similar species grew in the Holy Land, in the Hula region in ancient times (Theophrastus, History of Plants 9:7).\\" =Cymbopogon= Maimonides, in contrast, indicates that it was the Indian plant, rosha grass (Cymbopogon martinii), which resembles red straw.Mishneh Torah, Kley HaMikdash 1:3 Many standard reference works on Bible plants by Michael Zohary (University of Jerusalem, Cambridge, 1985), James A. Duke (2010), and Hans Arne Jensen (Danish 2004, English translation 2012) support this conclusion, arguing that the plant was a variety of Cymbopogon. James A. Duke, quoting Zohary, notes that it is \\"hopeless to speculate\\" about the exact species, but that Cymbopogon citratus (Indian lemon-grass) and Cymbopogon schoenanthus are also possibilities.Duke, James, Duke's Handbook of Medicinal Plants of the Bible, CRC Press, 2010, p.170.Myers, Allen & Beck, A, Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible, Eerdmans, 2000, p.1259. Kaplan follows Maimonides in identifying it as the Cymbopogon martinii or palmarosa plant.Kaplan, Aryeh. The Living Torah New York 1981. p. 442.◊°◊§◊® ◊î◊¢◊ë◊ï◊ì◊î - Volume 8, Num√©ro 1 - Page 136 Moses Maimonides - 2007 \\"One who willfully prepares anointing oil in this manner and with these measurements without adding or reducing [the quantity of the herbs] ... In his Living Torah, Rav Aryeh Kaplan identifies this as the Cymbopogon martinii or palmarosa plant.\\" = Cannabis, and others = Other possible identifications have also been made. Sula Benet in Early Diffusion and Folk Uses of Hemp (1967), identified it as cannabis.Sula Benet, Early Diffusion and Folk Uses of Hemp (1967) Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan notes that \\"On the basis of cognate pronunciation and Septuagint readings, some identify Keneh bosem with the English and Greek cannabis, the hemp plant. There are, however, some authorities who identify the 'sweet cane' with cinnamon bark (Radak, Sherashim). Some say that kinman is the wood, and keneh bosem is the bark (Abarbanel).\\" Kaplan, Aryeh. The Living Torah New York 1981.p. 442.. Benet in contrast argued that equating Keneh Bosem with sweet cane could be traced to a mistranslation in the Septuagint, which mistook Keneh Bosem, later referred to as \\"cannabos\\" in the Talmud, as \\"kalabos\\", a common Egyptian marsh cane plant. Several churches, including THC Ministries, Green Faith Ministries, Temple 420, and Templul Cannabisului (Romania) use cannabis as an ingredient in holy anointing oil, medicines, and incense, believing that kaneh bosm is cannabis. The anointing oil is also associated with the Plant of Renown and Tree of life mentioned in Revelation 22:2. In Rabbinic Judaism The Talmud asserts that the original anointing oil prepared by Moses remained miraculously intact and was used by future generations without replacement, including in the future Third Temple when it is rebuilt.Rashi to Exodus 30:31; Horiyos 11b Vendyl Jones claimed that such a small quantity of oil (around a gallon) would not last that long (it is claimed that one juglet of oil lasted over 800 years).Jones, ThD, Professor Vendyl, Researcher 17, March 2004 To explain this discrepancy it is claimed that one of two things occurred: Either the container of holy anointing oil miraculously multiplied (similar to Elijah's multiplication of oil for the widow of Zarephath or the Chanukah oil miracle)Zeitlin, Solomon. \\"Hanukkah: Its Origin and Its Significance.\\" The Jewish Quarterly Review (1938): 1-36 or, following ancient customs, new oil was added to the old thus continuing the original oil for all time.http://www.historykb.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/history/9593/Shemen-HaMishcha- The-Holy-Anointing-Oil#d815695077efbuwe This is not the only ritual in which Jewish tradition emphasizes continuity. For example, early Jewish rabbis stressed the importance of the succession of classical semikhahLewis, Hal M. From sanctuary to boardroom: A Jewish approach to leadership. Rowman & Littlefield Pub Incorporated, 2006. and one Jewish tradition teaches that the ashes of the last red heifer sacrificed were always mixed with the ashes of each new red heifer.Red Heifer - The Original Ashes In Christianity Anointing oil is used in some Christian communities. A passage in the New Testament says, The Catholic Church emphasized the importance of apostolic succession, the continuity of laying on of hands for ordination, in an unbroken chain.Molland, Einar. \\"Irenaeus of Lugdunum and the Apostolic Succession.\\" Journal of (1950). =In the Armenian Church= The holy anointing oil of the Armenian Church is called the holy muron ('muron' means myrrh).Tchilingirian, Hratch. \\"The Armenian Church.\\" The church holds a special reverence for the continuity factor of the oil.Sahagun, Louis, The Los Angeles Times, 10/11/2008Abrahamian, Nyree, The blessing of the Muron: Behind the ritual According to tradition, a portion of the holy anointing oil of Exodus 30, which Moses and Aaron had blessed, still remained in Jesus' time. Jesus Christ blessed this oil and then gave some of it to Thaddeus, who took the holy oil to Armenia and healed King Abkar of a terrible skin disease by anointing him with the holy oil. Saint Thaddeus is said to have buried a bottle of the holy anointing oil in Daron under an evergreen tree. Saint Gregory the Illuminator discovered the hidden treasure and mixed it with muron that he had blessed. It is said that \\"To this day, whenever a new batch of muron is prepared and blessed, a few drops of the old one go into it, so that the Armenian muron always contains a small amount of the original oil blessed by Moses, Jesus Christ, and Gregory the Illuminator.\\"Reporter.am The holy muron is composed of olive oil and forty-eight aromas and flowers. The remaining portion of the previous blessed holy oil is poured into the newly prepared oil during the blessing ceremony and passes the blessing from generation to generation. It is said that this very procedure has been followed for nearly 1700 years. The Catholicos of all Armenians in Etchmiadzin combines a new mixture of holy muron in the cauldron every seven years using a portion of the holy muron from the previous blend. This is distributed to all of the Armenian churches throughout the world. Before Christianity, muron was reserved solely for the enthroning of royalty and for very special events. In later years, it was used with extreme unction and to heal the sick, and to anoint ordained clergy.Armenian Heritage, The Blessing of the Holy Muron =In the Assyrian Church of the East= It is said by the Assyrian Church that the holy anointing oil \\"was given and handed down to us by our holy fathers Mar Addai and Mar Mari and Mar Tuma.\\" The holy anointing oil of the Assyrian Church is variously referred to as the Oil of the Holy Horn, the Oil of the Qarna, or the Oil of Unction. This holy oil is an apostolic tradition, believed to have originated from the oil consecrated by the apostles themselves, and which by succession has been handed down in the Church to this day.Catholic ecycl The original oil which the disciples blessed began to run low and more oil was added to it. The Assyrian Church believes that this has continued to this very day with new oil being added as the oil level lowers. This succession of holy oil is believed to be a continuity of the blessings placed upon the oil from the beginning.* Both the Oil of Unction and the Holy Leaven are referred to as \\"leaven\\" although there is no actual leavening agent, so the nomenclature Holy Leaven seems to be a bit misleading. Yohanan bar Abgareh referred to it in 905 as did Shlemon d-Basra in the 13th century. Yohanan bar Zo‚Äôbee in the 14th century integrated the Holy Oil of unction with baptism and other rites. Isaaq Eshbadhnaya in the 15th century wrote the Scholion which is a commentary on specific theological topics. It tells us that John the Baptist gave John the Evangelist a baptismal vessel of water from Christ‚Äôs baptism, which was collected by John the Baptist from water dripping from Christ after his baptism in Jordan River. Jesus gave each disciple a \\"loaf,\\" at the Last Supper, but the Scholion informs us that to John he gave two with the instructions to eat only one and to save the other. At the crucifixion John collected the water from the Lord's side in the vessel and the blood he collected on the loaf from the Last Supper. After the descent of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost the disciples took the vessel and mixed it with oil and each took a horn of it. The loaf they ground up and added flour and salt to it. Each took a portion of the holy oil and the holy bread which were distributed in every land by the hand of those who missionized there.MacLean & Browne, The Catholicos of the East and his People, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1892. pages 247 & 248.Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, Commission on Inter-Church Relations and Education Development, Fifth Pro Oriente Non-official Consultation on Dialogue within the Churches of the Syriac Tradition: \\"Sacraments in the Syriac Tradition ‚Äî Part II\\", 26 February to 1 March 2002; Vienna (Austria), The Sacrament of the Holy Leaven \\"Malka\\" and the Holy Oil The Assyrian Church has two types of holy oils; the one is ordinary olive oil, blessed or not blessed, the other is the oil of the Holy Horn which is believed to have been handed down from the apostles. The Holy Horn is constantly renewed by the addition of oil blessed by a bishop on Maundy Thursday. While almost anyone can by tradition be anointed with the regular oil, the oil of the Holy Horn is restricted for ordination and sanctification purposes. =In the Coptic Church= The holy anointing oil of the Coptic Church is referred to as the holy myron ('myron' means myrrh). The laying on of hands for the dwelling of the Holy Spirit is believed to have been a specific rite of the apostles and their successors the bishops, and as the regions of mission increased, consequently numbers of Christian believers and converts increased. It was not possible for the apostles to wander through all the countries and cities to lay hands on all of those baptized, so they established anointment by the holy myron as an alternative, it is believed, for the laying on of the hands for the Holy Spirit‚Äôs indwelling. The first who made the myron were the apostles who had kept the fragrant oils which were on the body of Jesus Christ during his burial, and they added the spices which were brought by those women who prepared them to anoint Christ, but had discovered he had been resurrected. They melted all these spices in pure olive oil, prayed on it in the upper room in Zion, and made it a holy anointing oil. They decided that their successors, the bishops, must renew the making of the myron whenever it is nearly used up, by incorporating the original oil with the new. Today the Coptic Church uses it for ordination, in the sanctification of baptismal water, and in the consecration of churches and church altars and vessels. It is said that when St. Mark went to Alexandria, he took with him some of the holy myron oil made by the apostles and that he used it in the sacrament of Chrism, as did the patriarchs who succeeded him. This continued until the era of Athanasius the Apostolic, the 20th patriarch, who then decided to remake the myron in Alexandria. Hence, it is reported, he prepared all of the needed perfumes and spices, with pure olive oil, from which God ordered Moses to make the holy anointing oil as specified in the recipe in the thirtieth chapter of the book of Exodus. Then the sanctification of the holy myron was fulfilled in Alexandria, and Athanasius was entrusted with the holy oil, which contained spices which touched Jesus‚Äôs body while it was in the tomb, as well as the original oil which had been prepared by the apostles and brought to Egypt by St. Mark. He distributed the oil to the churches abroad: to the See of Rome, Antioch and Constantinople, together with a document of its authenticity, and all of the patriarchs are said to have rejoiced in receiving it.Copticchurch.net The Coptic Church informs that the fathers of the Church and scholars like St. Justin Martyr, Tertullian, St. Hippolytus, Origen, St. Ambrose, and St. Cyril of Jerusalem, spoke about the holy myron and how they received its use in anointing by tradition. For example, St. Hippolytus in his Apostolic Tradition, speaks of the holy oil \\"according to ancient custom\\" quoted in Berardino, Encyclopedia of the Early Church, v. 1, p. 190 Origen writes about the holy oil ‚Äúaccording to the tradition of the church\\" in Rom. Comm. V, 8; quoted in Berardino, ibid. St. Cyril of Jerusalem goes into further detail in speaking about the grace of the Holy Spirit in the holy myron: \\"this oil is not just any oil: after the epiclesis of the Spirit, it becomes charism of Christ and power of the Holy Spirit through the presence of the deity\\" Cat. 21, 3; quoted in Berardino, ibid. The early fathers and scholars mention the use of the holy myron, as well as a documentation by Abu'l-Barakat Ibn Kabar, a 14th-century Coptic priest and scholar, in his book Misbah az-Zulmah fi idah al-khidmah (The Lamp of Darkness in Clarifying the Service). According to his account, the holy apostles took from the spices that were used to anoint the body of Jesus Christ when he was buried,cf. John 19:38-40 added pure olive oil to it, and prayed over it in Upper Zion, the first church where the Holy Spirit fell in the upper room. This holy oil was then distributed among all of the apostles so that wherever they preached, new converts would be anointed with it as a seal. They also commanded that whenever a new batch of Holy Myron was made, they add to it the old holy myron to keep the first holy myron continually with all that would ever be made afterwards. According to the available resources, the holy myron in the Church of Egypt has been made 34 times. Suscopts.orgBurmester, O. H.

It is reported that Jewish communities already present in India enticed Thomas to make his missionary journey there. It is said that he brought holy anointing oil with him and that the St. Thomas Christians still have this oil to this day.Malankarorthodoxchurch.in Patriarch Ya\`qub, of the Syrian Malabar Nasrani Church, is remembered for his celebration of the liturgy and his humble encouragement to accept the simple way of life. After he consecrated sacred myron in the Mor Gabriel monastery in 1964, holy myron flowed from the glass container the following day and many people were said to have been healed by it.Syriac Orthodox Resources See also * Abramelin oil * Holy water * Shemen Afarsimon, oil of persimmon, in the Mishnah * Washing and anointing References Category:Religious objects Category:Christian terminology Category:Oils Category:Tabernacle and Temples in Jerusalem Category:Judaism terminology ","title":"Holy anointing oil"},{"id":"1962533","text":"Blake Lanier GottesmanAccording to the State of Texas.

It currently contains two species, R. gilmorei and R. isosceles.  Species  Tooth of cf. R. isosceles with close up of denticles The holotype specimen of Richardoestesia gilmorei (NMC 343) consists of the pair of lower jaws found in the upper Judith River Group, dating from the Campanian age, about 75 million years ago. The jaws are slender and rather long, 193 millimeter, but the teeth are small and very finely serrated with five to six denticles per millimeter. The serration density is a distinctive trait of the species. In 2001, Julia Sankey named a second species: Richardoestesia isosceles, based on a tooth, LSUMGS 489:6238, from the Texan Aguja Formation, which is of a longer and less recurved type.J.T. Sankey, 2001, \\"Late Campanian southern dinosaurs, Aguja Formation, Big Bend, Texas\\", Journal of Paleontology 75(1): 208-215 The teeth of R. isosceles have also been identified as crocodyliform in shape, possibly belonging to a sebecosuchian.  Research  The jaws were found in 1917 by Charles Hazelius Sternberg and sons in the Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta at the Little Sandhill Creek site. In 1924 Charles Whitney Gilmore named Chirostenotes pergracilis and referred the jaws to this species.Gilmore, C.W., 1924, \\"A new coelurid dinosaur from the Belly River Cretaceous of Alberta\\", Canada Department of Mines Geological Survey Bulletin (Geological Series) 38(43): 1-12 In the eighties it became clear that Chirostenotes was an oviraptosaur to which the long jaws could not have belonged. Therefore, in 1990 Phillip Currie, John Keith Rigby and Robert Evan Sloan named a separate species: Richardoestesia gilmorei.Currie, P. J., K. J. Rigby, and R. E. Sloan. 1990. \\"Theropod teeth from the Judith River Formation of southern Alberta, Canada\\". Pp. 107‚Äì125. In P. J. Currie, and K. Carpenter, eds. Dinosaur Systematics: Perspectives and Approaches. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. The genus is named for Richard Estes, to honor his important workEstes, R., 1964, Fossil vertebrates from the Late Cretaceous Lance Formation, eastern Wyoming. University of California Publications in Geological Sciences 49: 1-180 on small vertebrates and especially theropod teeth of the Late Cretaceous. The naming authors actually intended to use the spelling Ricardoestesia, Ricardus being the normal latinisation of \\"Richard\\". However, except in one overlooked figure caption, the editors of the paper altered the spelling to include the 'h'. Ironically, in 1991 George Olshevsky in a species list also used the spelling Richardoestesia, and indicated Ricardoestesia to be the misspelling, unaware that the original authors actually intended the name to be spelled this way. As a result, under ICZN rules, he acted as \\"first revisor\\" choosing between the two spelling variants of the original publication and inadvertently made the misspelt name official. Subsequently, the original authors have adopted the spelling Richardoestesia. The specific name honors Gilmore.  Age range  Referred teeth from the San Juan Basin Richardoestesia-like teeth have been found in many Late Cretaceous geological formations, including the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, the Scollard Formation, Hell Creek Formation, Ferris Formation, and the Lance Formation (dated to about 66 million years ago). Similar teeth have been referred to this genus from as early as the Barremian age (Cedar Mountain Formation, 125 million years ago).Kirkland, Lucas and Estep, (1998). \\"Cretaceous dinosaurs of the Colorado Plateau.\\" in Lucas, Kirkland and Estep (eds.). Lower and Middle Cretaceous Terrestrial Ecosystems. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, 14, 79-89. Because of the disparity in location and time of the many referred teeth, researchers have cast doubt on the idea that they all belong to the same genus or species, and the genus is best considered a form taxon. A comparative study of the teeth published in 2013 demonstrated that both R. gilmorei and R. isosceles were only definitively present in the Dinosaur Park Formation, dated to between 76.5 and 75 million years ago. R. isosceles was also present in the Aguja Formation, roughly the same age. All other referred teeth most likely belong to different species, which have not been named due to the lack of body fossils for comparison.Larson DW, Currie PJ (2013) Multivariate Analyses of Small Theropod Dinosaur Teeth and Implications for Paleoecological Turnover through Time. PLoS ONE 8(1): e54329. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054329 Fossils of Richartoestesia have also been found in the Tremp Formation of northeastern Spain and possibly also the Lourinha Formation (Blasi 2 member) of Portugal, although this is unlikely since the Lourinha Formation dates to the Late Jurassic (152 Ma).Blasi 2 at Fossilworks.org  References   Further reading  * Baszio, S. 1997.

They are not stable, and because of the communication and behavior of other people, are subject to change by social influences, as well as by the individual's motivation to maintain cognitive consistency when cognitive dissonance occurs‚Äîwhen two attitudes or attitude and behavior conflict. Attitudes and attitude objects are functions of affective and cognitive components. It has been suggested that the inter-structural composition of an associative network can be altered by the activation of a single node. Thus, by activating an affective or emotional node, attitude change may be possible, though affective and cognitive components tend to be intertwined.Eagly, A., & Chaiken, S. (1995). Attitude strength, attitude structure and resistance to change. In R. Petty and J. Kosnik (Eds.), Attitude Strength. (pp. 413‚Äì432). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. Bases There are three bases for attitude change: compliance, identification, and internalization. These three processes represent the different levels of attitude change. =Compliance= One of the pairs of cards used in the experiment. The card on the left has the reference line and the one on the right shows the three comparison lines. Compliance refers to a change in behavior based on consequences, such as an individual's hopes to gain rewards or avoid punishment from another group or person. The individual does not necessarily experience changes in beliefs or evaluations of an attitude object, but rather is influenced by the social outcomes of adopting a change in behavior. The individual is also often aware that he or she is being urged to respond in a certain way. Compliance was demonstrated through a series of laboratory experiments known as the Asch experiments. Experiments led by Solomon Asch of Swarthmore College asked groups of students to participate in a \\"vision test\\". In reality, all but one of the participants were confederates of the experimenter, and the study was really about how the remaining student would react to the confederates' behavior. Participants were asked to pick, out of three line options, the line that is the same length as a sample and were asked to give the answer out loud. Unbeknown to the participants, Asch had placed a number of confederates to deliberately give the wrong answer before the participant. The results showed that 75% of responses were in line with majority influence and were the same answers the confederates picked.Asch, S. E. (1956). Studies of independence and conformity: A minority of one against a unanimous majority. Psychological Monographs, 70 (Whole no. 416). Variations in the experiments showed that compliance rates increased as the number of confederates increased, and the plateau was reached with around 15 confederates. The likelihood of compliance dropped with minority opposition, even if only one confederate gave the correct answer. The basis for compliance is founded on the fundamental idea that people want to be accurate and right. =Identification= Identification explains one's change of beliefs and affect in order to be similar to someone one admires or likes. In this case, the individual adopts the new attitude, not due to the specific content of the attitude object, but because it is associated with the desired relationship. Often, children's attitudes on race, or their political party affiliations are adopted from their parents' attitudes and beliefs. =Internalization= Internalization refers to the change in beliefs and affect when one finds the content of the attitude to be intrinsically rewarding, and thus leads to actual change in beliefs or evaluations of an attitude object. The new attitude or behavior is consistent with the individual's value system, and tends to be merged with the individual's existing values and beliefs. Therefore, behaviors adopted through internalization are due to the content of the attitude object. The expectancy- value theory is based on internalization of attitude change. This model states that the behavior towards some object is a function of an individual's intent, which is a function of one's overall attitude towards the action. Emotion- based Emotion plays a major role in persuasion, social influence, and attitude change. Much of attitude research has emphasised the importance of affective or emotion components.Breckler, S. J., & Wiggins, E. C. (1992). On defining attitude and attitude theory: Once more with feeling. In A. R. Pratkanis, S. J. Breckler, & A. G. Greenwald (Eds.) Attitude Structure and Function (pp. 407‚Äì427). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. Emotion works hand-in-hand with the cognitive process, or the way we think, about an issue or situation. Emotional appeals are commonly found in advertising, health campaigns and political messages. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns (see tobacco advertising) and political campaigns emphasizing the fear of terrorism. Attitude change based on emotions can be seen vividly in serial killers who are faced with major stress.Davis, E. E. (1965). Attitude change: A review and bibliography of selected research. Paris: Unesco. There is considerable empirical support for the idea that emotions in the form of fear arousal,Leventhal, 1970Maddux & Rogers, 1980 empathy,Shelton & Rogers, 1981 or a positive moodJanis, Kaye, & Kirschner, 1965 can enhance attitude change under certain conditions.Leventhal, H. A. (1970) Findings and theory in the study of fear communications.In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 5, pp. 120-186). Orlando, FL: Academic Press. Important factors that influence the impact of emotional appeals include self- efficacy, attitude accessibility, issue involvement, and message/source features. Attitudes that are central to one's being are highly resistant to change while others that are less fixed may change with new experiences or information. A new attitude (e.g. to time-keeping or absenteeism or quality) may challenge existing beliefs or norms so creating a feeling of psychological discomfort known as cognitive dissonance. It is difficult to measure attitude change since attitudes may only be inferred and there might be significant divergence between those publicly declared and privately held. Self-efficacy is a perception of one's own human agency; in other words, it is the perception of our own ability to deal with a situation. It is an important variable in emotional appeal messages because it dictates a person's ability to deal with both the emotion and the situation. For example, if a person is not self-efficacious about their ability to impact the global environment, they are not likely to change their attitude or behaviour about global warming. Affective forecasting, otherwise known as intuition or the prediction of emotion, also impacts attitude change. Research suggests that predicting emotions is an important component of decision making, in addition to the cognitive processes.Loewenstein, G. (2007). Affect regulation and affective forecasting. In Gross, J. J. (Ed.) Handbook of Emotion Regulation (pp. 180‚Äì203). New York: Guilford. How we feel about an outcome may override purely cognitive rationales. In terms of research methodology, the challenge for researchers is measuring emotion and subsequent impacts on attitude. Since we cannot see into the brain, various models and measurement tools have been constructed to obtain emotion and attitude information. Measures may include the use of physiological cues like facial expressions, vocal changes, and other body rate measures. For instance, fear is associated with raised eyebrows, increased heart rate and increased body tension. Other methods include concept or network mapping, and using primes or word cues. Dual models: depth of processing Many dual process models are used to explain the affective (emotional) and cognitive processing and interpretations of messages, as well as the different depths of attitude change. These include the heuristic-systematic model of information processing and the elaboration likelihood model. =Heuristic-systematic model of information processing= The heuristic-systematic model of information processing describes two depths in the processing of attitude change, systematic processing and heuristic processing. In this modelChaiken, S., Liberman, A. & Eagly, A. H. (1989). Heuristic and systematic information processing within and beyond the persuasion context. In J. S. Uleman & J. A. Bargh. (Eds.), Unintended thought, pp. 212-252. New York: Guilford. information is either processed in a high- involvement and high-effort systematic way, or information is processed through shortcuts known as heuristics. For example, emotions are affect-based heuristics, in which feelings and gut-feeling reactions are often used as shortcuts. Systematic processing Systematic processing occurs when individuals are motivated and have high cognition to process a message. Individuals using systematic processing are motivated to pay attention and have the cognitive ability to think deeply about a message; they are persuaded by the content of the message, such as the strength or logic of the argument. Motivation can be determined by many factors, such as how personally relevant the topic is, and cognitive ability can be determined by how knowledgeable an individual is on the message topic, or whether or not there is a distraction in the room. Individuals who receive a message through systematic processing usually internalize the message, resulting in a longer and more stable attitude change. According to the heuristic-systematic model of information processing, people are motivated to use systematic processing when they want to achieve a \\"desired level of confidence\\" in their judgments. There are factors that have been found to increase the use of systematic processing; these factors are associated with either decreasing an individual's actual confidence or increasing an individual's perceived confidence. These factors may include framing persuasive messages in an unexpected manner; self- relevancy of the message. Systematic processing has been shown to be beneficial in social influence settings. Systematic reasoning has been shown to be successful in producing more valid solutions during group discussions and greater solution accuracy. Shestowsky's (1998) research in dyad discussions revealed that the individual in the dyad who had high motivation and high need in cognition had the greater impact on group decisions. Heuristic processing Heuristic processing occurs when individuals have low motivation and/or low cognitive ability to process a message. Instead of focusing on the argument of the message, recipients using heuristic processing focus on more readily accessible information and other unrelated cues, such as the authority or attractiveness of the speaker. Individuals who process a message through heuristic processing do not internalize the message, and thus any attitude change resulting from the persuasive message is temporary and unstable. For example, people are more likely to grant favors if reasons are provided. A study shows that when people said, \\"Excuse me, I have five pages to xerox. May I use the copier?\\" they received a positive response of 60%. The statement, \\"Excuse me, I have five pages to xerox. I am in a rush. May I use the copier?\\" produced a 95% success rate.Langer, Blank, & Chanowitz (1978) Heuristic processing examples include social proof, reciprocity, authority, and liking. *Social proof is the means by which we utilize other people's behaviors in order to form our own beliefs. Our attitudes toward following the majority change when a situation appears uncertain or ambiguous to us, when the source is an expert, or when the source is similar to us. In a study conducted by Sherif, he discovered the power of crowds when he worked with experimenters who looked up in the middle of New York City. As the number of the precipitating group increased, the percentage of passers-by who looked up increased as well.Sherif (1936) *Reciprocity is returning a favor. People are more likely to return a favor if they have a positive attitude towards the other party. Reciprocities also develop interdependence and societal bonds. *Authority plays a role in attitude change in situations where there are superior-inferior relationships. We are more likely to become obedient to authorities when the authority's expertise is perceived as high and when we anticipate receiving rewards. A famous study that constitutes the difference in attitude change is the Milgram experiment, where people changed their attitude to \\"shocking their partner\\" more when they followed authorities whereas the subjects themselves would have not done so otherwise. *Liking has shown that if one likes another party, one is more inclined to carry out a favor. The attitude changes are based on whether an individual likes an idea or person, and if he or she does not like the other party, he/she may not carry out the favor or do so out of obligation. Liking can influence one's opinions through factors such as physical attractiveness, similarities, compliments, contact and cooperation. =Elaboration likelihood model= The elaboration likelihood model is similar in concept to and shares many ideas with other dual processing models, such as the heuristic-systematic model of information processing.Albarracin, D., Johnson, B. T., & Zanna, M. P. (20050. Then handbook of attitudes. Mahwah, N.J: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers. In the elaboration likelihood model, cognitive processing is the central route and affective/emotion processing is often associated with the peripheral route. The central route pertains to an elaborate cognitive processing of information while the peripheral route relies on cues or feelings. The ELM suggests that true attitude change only happens through the central processing route that incorporates both cognitive and affective components as opposed to the more heuristics-based peripheral route. This suggests that motivation through emotion alone will not result in an attitude change. Cognitive dissonance theory Cognitive dissonance, a theory originally developed by Festinger (1957), is the idea that people experience a sense of guilt or uneasiness when two linked cognitions are inconsistent, such as when there are two conflicting attitudes about a topic, or inconsistencies between one's attitude and behavior on a certain topic. The basic idea of the Cognitive Dissonance Theory relating to attitude change, is that people are motivated to reduce dissonance which can be achieved through changing their attitudes and beliefs.Festinger, L. (1957). A theory of cognitive dissonance. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. Cooper & Fazio's (1984) have also added that cognitive dissonance does not arise from any simple cognitive inconsistency, but rather results from freely chosen behavior that may bring about negative consequences.Cooper J, Fazio RH. 1984. A new look at dissonance theory. Adv. Exp. Soc. Psychol.17:229‚Äì66 These negative consequences may be threats to the consistency, stability, predictability, competence, moral goodness of the self-concept,Aronson E. 1992. The return of the repressed:Dissonance theory makes a comeback. Psychol.Inq. 3:303‚Äì11 or violation of general self-integrity.Steele CM. 1988. The psychology of selfaffirmation.Adv. Exp. Soc. Psychol.21:261‚Äì302 Research has suggested multiple routes that cognitive dissonance can be reduced. Self-affirmation has been shown to reduce dissonance, however it is not always the mode of choice when trying to reduce dissonance. When multiple routes are available, it has been found that people prefer to reduce dissonance by directly altering their attitudes and behaviors rather than through self-affirmation. People who have high levels of self-esteem, who are postulated to possess abilities to reduce dissonance by focusing on positive aspects of the self, have also been found to prefer modifying cognitions, such as attitudes and beliefs, over self- affirmation. A simple example of cognitive dissonance resulting in attitude change would be when a heavy smoker learns that his sister died young from lung cancer due to heavy smoking as well, this individual experiences conflicting cognitions: the desire to smoke, and the knowledge that smoking could lead to death and a desire not to die. In order to reduce dissonance, this smoker could change his behavior (i.e. stop smoking), change his attitude about smoking (i.e. smoking is harmful), or retain his original attitude about smoking and modify his new cognition to be consistent with the first one\\"I also work out so smoking won't be harmful to me\\". Thus, attitude change is achieved when individuals experience feelings of uneasiness or guilt due to cognitive dissonance, and actively reduce the dissonance through changing their attitude, beliefs, or behavior relating in order to achieve consistency with the inconsistent cognitions. Sorts of studies Carl Hovland and his band of persuasion researchers learned a great deal during World War 2 and later at Yale about the process of attitude change.Rogers, Everett M:A history of communication study *High-credibility sources lead to more attitude change immediately following the communication act, but a sleeper effect occurs in which the source is forgotten after a period of time. *Mild fear appeals lead to more attitude change than strong fear appeals. Propagandists had often used fear appeals. Hoveland's evidence about the effect of such appeals suggested that a source should be cautious in using fear appeals, because strong fear messages may interfere with the intended persuasion attempt. =Belief rationalization= The process of how people change their own attitudes has been studied for years. Belief rationalization has been recognized as an important aspect to understand this process. The stability of people's past attitudes can be influenced if they hold beliefs that are inconsistent with their own behaviors. The influence of past behavior on current attitudes is stable when little information conflicts with the behavior. Alternatively, people's attitudes may lean more radically toward the prior behavior if the conflict makes it difficult to ignore, and forces them to rationalize their past behavior.Festinger, L. (1957). A theory of cognitive dissonance. Evanston, IL: Row, Peterson. Attitudes are often restructured at the time people are asked to report them.Erber, M. W., Hodges, S. D., & Wilson, T. D. (1995). Attitude strength, attitude stability, and the effects of analyzing reasons. In R. E. Petty & J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences. Ohio State University series on attitudes and persuasion (Vol. 4, pp. 433-454. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence ErlbaumJudd, C. M., & Brauer, M. (1995). Repetition and evaluative extremity. In R. E. Petty & J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences. Ohio State University series on attitudes and persuasion (Vol. 4, pp. 43-71). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. As a result, inconsistencies between the information that enters into the reconstruction and the original attitudes can produce changes in prior attitudes, whereas consistency between these elements often elicits stability in prior attitudes. Individuals need to resolve the conflict between their own behaviors and the subsequent beliefs. However, people usually align themselves with their attitudes and beliefs instead of their behaviors. More importantly, this process of resolving people's cognitive conflicts that emerges cuts across both self-perception and dissonance even when the associated effect may only be strong in changing prior attitudes =Comparative processing= Human judgment is comparative in nature. Departing from identifying people's need to justify their own beliefs in the context of their own behaviors, psychologists also believe that people have the need to carefully evaluate new messages on the basis of whether these messages support or contradict with prior messages, regardless of whether they can recall the prior messages after they reach a conclusion. This comparative processing mechanism is built on \\"information-integration theory\\" and \\"social judgement theory\\".Sherif, M., & Hovland, C. I. (1961). Placement of items on controversial issues. In M. Sherif & C. Hovland (Eds.), Social judgment (pp. 99‚Äì126). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. Both of these theories have served to model people's attitude change in judging the new information while they haven't adequately explained the influential factors that motivate people to integrate the information. More recent work in the area of persuasion has further explored this \\"comparative processing\\" from the perspective of focusing on comparing between different sets of information on one single issue or object instead of simply making comparisons among different issues or objects. As previous research demonstrated, analyzing information on one target product may trigger less impact of comparative information than comparing this product with the same product under competing brands. When people compare different sets of information on one single issue or object, the effect of people's effort to compare new information with prior information seemed to correlate with the perceived strength of the new, strong information when considered jointly with the initial information. Comparison processes can be enhanced when prior evaluations, associated information, or both are accessible. People will simply construct a current judgment based on the new information or adjust the prior judgment when they are not able to retrieve the information from prior messages. The impact this comparative process can have on people's attitude change is mediated by changes in the strength of new information perceived by receivers. The effects of comparison on judgment change were mediated by changes in the perceived strength of the information. These findings above have wide range of applications in social marketing, political communication, and health promotion. For example, designing an advertisement that is counteractive against an existing attitude towards a behavior or policy is perhaps most effective if the advertisement uses the same format, characters, or music of ads associated with the initial attitudes.

He played for 11 seasons in Major League Baseball, all for the New York Yankees, and coached for 23 seasons, for the Yankees, New York Mets, Houston Astros, and Seattle Mariners. He was a five-time MLB All-Star as a player and a five-time World Series champion as a coach.  Baseball career  = As a player (1964‚Äì1974) = Stottlemyre pitched in American Legion Baseball and attended Mabton High School in Mabton, Washington, and Yakima Valley Community College. A scout for the New York Yankees discovered Stottlemyre pitching for Yakima's baseball team, and signed him to a contract with no signing bonus on June 10, 1961. The Yankees assigned him to the Harlan Smokies of the Rookie-level Appalachian League. After appearing in eight games, the Yankees promoted him to the Auburn Yankees of the Class D New York‚ÄìPenn League, and he appeared in seven games for Auburn. Stottlemyre pitched to a 17‚Äì9 win‚Äìloss record and a 2.50 earned run average (ERA) with the Greensboro Yankees of the Class B Carolina League in 1962, and was promoted to the Richmond Virginians of the Class AAA International League in 1963. He alternated between starting and relieving for Richmond, before Ralph Houk, the Yankees' general manager, insisted that Stottlemyre be used exclusively as a starting pitcher. He recorded a 1.42 ERA in the 1964 season, the best in the International League. Called up midseason in 1964, Stottlemyre went 9‚Äì3 to help the Yankees to their fifth consecutive pennant while being on the cover of The Sporting News. In the 1964 World Series, Stottlemyre faced Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals three times in the seven-game Series. Stottlemyre bested Gibson in Game 2 to even the series, and got a no-decision in Game 5, but lost the decisive Game 7 as the Cardinals won the Series. Stottlemyre was named to the American League's (AL) roster for the 1965 Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game, though he did not appear in the game. He won 20 games in the 1965 season, and led the AL with 18 complete games, 291 innings pitched, and 1,188 batters faced. He appeared in the 1966 MLB All-Star Game. He led the league with 20 losses. Stottlemyre won 20 games in the 1968 and 1969 seasons. He also started the 1969 MLB All-Star Game. Stottlemyre threw 40 shutouts in his 11-season career, the same number as Hall of Fame lefty Sandy Koufax, which ties for 44th best all-time. Eighteen of those shutouts came in a three-season span from 1971‚Äì73. The Yankees released Stottlemyre before the 1975 season. Stottlemyre retired with 164 career wins and a 2.97 ERA. Known as a solid-hitting pitcher, on July 20, 1965, Stottlemyre hit a rare inside-the-park grand slam. On September 26, 1964, he recorded five base hits in five at bats. = Coaching years (1984‚Äì2008) = Stottlemyre at his Monument Park plaque dedication in 2015 In 1977, Stottlemyre re-emerged in baseball as a roving instructor for the Seattle Mariners. He spent five seasons in that position, and was hired by the New York Mets as their pitching coach in November 1983. He served in the role for ten years (including the 1986 World Series championship team) and then followed that by serving a two-year stint as the Houston Astros pitching coach.  New York Yankees (1996‚Äì2005)  In 1996, Stottlemyre joined the Yankees coaching staff along with the incoming manager Joe Torre. Under Torre, Stottlemyre lowered the team ERA from 4.65 in 1996 to 3.84 in 1997. Under Stottlemyre, the Yankee team averaged an ERA of 4.23 from 1996 to 2005. The pitching staff was regarded as a major factor in the team's dynasty years, when they won four World Series Championships in five years. After 10 seasons, Stottlemyre resigned his coaching position on October 12, 2005, following the Yankees' defeat in the 2005 American League Division Series by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He cited personal disagreements with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner among his reasons for leaving and cited Steinbrenner's comment that, after the division series was over, he had congratulated Angels manager Mike Scioscia. Stottlemyre's response was: \\"My first thought was, 'What about Joe?' Joe did a hell of a job, too. To congratulate the other manager and not congratulate your own, after what he's done this year, I laughed.\\" The Yankees replaced Stottlemyre with former Yankees pitcher Ron Guidry.  Seattle Mariners (2008)  Stottlemyre was named pitching coach of the Seattle Mariners under manager John McLaren at the beginning of the 2008 season, and was retained by interim manager Jim Riggleman after McLaren's firing. He was dismissed after the season ended. Following the season, he retired from baseball.  Honors  The mayor of Mabton, Washington, declared October 12, 1964, to be \\"Mel Stottlemyre Day\\". He was inducted into the Washington State American Legion Baseball Hall of Fame in 2012.http://www.waalbhof.org/images/hof_2012.pdf At Old-Timers' Day on June 20, 2015, the Yankees dedicated a plaque in Monument Park in Stottlemyre's honor.  Personal life  Stottlemyre was raised in the town of Mabton, Washington, located in the south-central part of the state. He resided with his wife, Jean, in Issaquah, Washington. Two of his sons, Todd and Mel Jr., followed their father by becoming major-league pitchers. His other son, Jason, died of leukemia at the age of 11. Stottlemyre and John Harper coauthored an autobiography titled Pride and Pinstripes, published in 2007. Stottlemyre was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2000. In remission for several years, he was an avid supporter of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. The cancer reappeared in 2011. Stottlemyre died on January 13, 2019 at the age of 77, of cancer. To honor Stottlemyre, the Yankees wore black armbands on their uniform during the 2019 season.https://nypost.com/2019/03/28/yankees-are-using- armband-to-honor-mel-stottlemyre/  See also  *List of second-generation Major League Baseball players *List of Major League Baseball players who spent their entire career with one franchise  References   External links   : Category:1941 births Category:2019 deaths Category:American League All-Stars Category:Auburn Yankees players Category:Baseball coaches from Missouri Category:Baseball players from Missouri Category:Deaths from cancer in Washington (state) Category:Deaths from multiple myeloma Category:Greensboro Yankees players Category:Harlan Smokies players Category:Houston Astros coaches Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball pitching coaches Category:New York Mets coaches Category:New York Yankees coaches Category:New York Yankees players Category:People from Issaquah, Washington Category:People from Texas County, Missouri Category:Richmond Virginians (minor league) players Category:Seattle Mariners coaches Category:United States national baseball team people Category:Writers from Missouri ","title":"Mel Stottlemyre"},{"id":"1962548","text":"New York Rock is an off-Broadway musical by Yoko Ono.

On 22 March 1994 two transoms (the supporting beams suspended from wire ropes running from side to side beneath the bridge) snapped causing the bridge to collapse while beekeeper Kenneth Richards was crossing in a laden light truck. Richards was killed when the truck fell 30 metres into the river. History =Construction= The bridge was built on public landhttp://m.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui- chronicle/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503423&objectid;=11257489 in 1986 for Keith and Margaret Berryman, a nearby landowner, by members of the New Zealand Army and a group of Fijian army trainees, as an exercise. The design was based upon calculations by Lieutenant John Armstrong, with labour and logistics for construction provided at New Zealand army expense. The Berrymans were to provide all materials, but instead of the specified macrocarpa or tanalised radiata pine timber for the transoms and bearers, they obtained Douglas fir timber from a demolition site in Wanganui. Lieutenant Armstrong's initial reaction was not to proceed with construction using deficient materials, but he was eventually persuaded when Keith Berryman signed a statement, witnessed by a neighbouring JP, taking responsibility for the materials and their subsequent inspection and maintenance. Loading was recalculated accordingly. Untreated Douglas fir timber has featured in the leaky homes saga around New Zealand; it is difficult to treat against decay and untreated timber is suitable for use only where it can be adequately protected from moisture. Te Rata receives about 1800 mm (72 in) of rainfall per year, and the river gorge is continuously damp with frequent fog. =Collapse= G. W. Butcher, a retired Lieutenant Colonel and civil engineer, who reported on the collapse for the army, concluded that the failure was caused by \\"50% reduction in the nominal strength of the member ... entirely due to decay of the untreated timber.\\" Additional factors were \\"the decision to use two 300x75 beams bolted together for the transoms in place of a solid 300x150 member\\" and the lack of a \\"regular inspection and maintenance programme [...] by the owners of the bridge\\". The army withheld Butcher's report from the 1997 inquest into Richards' death and kept its contents secret until it was published illegally on the internet by the Berrymans' lawyer, Rob Moodie. The Berrymans claim that their fight against attempts by the Occupational Safety and Health department to prosecute them for Richards' death has led to bankruptcy and the loss of their farm. The complete text of the Butcher report is held at Wikisource:Butcher report. Its author could not previously comment publicly on its implications, but since its illegal distribution the Army has released the report. George Butcher has now spoken publicly and said Keith Berryman admitted to him that the transoms were in poor condition, that there was visible rot in some timbers, and that he was worried about the state of the bridge. Knowledge of an unsafe work environment and failure to prevent or isolate the risk is an offence in New Zealand, but the prosecution of the Berrymans failed when the judge ruled the bridge did not meet the definition of Mr Richards' place of work in the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992.  Time line of Te Rata bridges  The Berryman Bridge was the second suspension bridge to be the primary access to Te Rata. The earlier bridge, which collapsed around the 1980s, was a fearsome structure on the same site. In the 'Otago Born and Bred' articles noted below, this first bridge is referred to as the Hayes Bridge. The Hayes bridge, said to be 100 ft above the water, is understood by the Ruslings, still resident in the valley, to have been built by the Tichner brothers, formerly sailors, around 1915‚Äì1916. The cables consisted of bunches of 52 strands of No. 8 wire, and endured the whole life of the bridge, a period of at least 66 years. When the bridge finally collapsed under the weight of a mob of sheep, the uprights on the house side gave way, allowing the anchors to fall away. Evan and Bob Hayes, who were moving the sheep, were fortunately not on the bridge when it collapsed, but most of the sheep were either killed from the fall, or drowned in the Retaruke. * 1915‚Äì1916 Original bridge \\"Hayes bridge\\" constructed. * 1986 ‚Äì Second bridge constructed. * 1994 ‚Äì Bridge collapses. * 1997 ‚Äì Inquest into collapse. * 2008, May ‚Äì High Court quashes the parts of the 1997 finding by Taumarunui coroner that exonerated the Army, but stops short of exonerating the Berrymans * 2008, June ‚Äì Berrymans seek damages from Defence Force at the Court of Appeal * 2008, 25 September ‚Äì Court of Appeal decided Berryman's will have their claim of misfeasance heard. * 2009, 24 December ‚Äì Berrymans accept Government settlement offer of $150,000.

Designed to a United States Navy specification, the helicopter was produced from 1949 to 1954, and was also used by the United States Army and foreign navies. The HUP/H-25 was the first helicopter to perform a loop and to be produced with an autopilot. Design and development The design was a product of a competition by the U.S. Navy in 1945 for a compact utility/rescue helicopter to operate from ships including aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers. Either 2 or 3http://1000aircraftphotos.com/Contributions/WatkinsRay/8891.htm accessdate:26 January 2014 prototypes‚Äîdesignated PV-14 by the factory and XHJP-1 by the Navy‚Äîwere built and subjected to a side-by-side flight evaluation against the 3 prototypes of the Sikorsky XHJS-1; however, the XHJS was fundamentally a scaled-up version of the Sikorsky H-5, and the increased weight and size magnified the design's problems with maintaining proper weight and balance under varying loading conditions. The Piasecki won the competition, and with the introduction of the aircraft configuration letter \\"U\\" for Utility in the 1950s,Swanborough and Bowers 1976, pp.8‚Äì9. the aircraft was ordered for production as the HUP-1. The design featured two three-bladed, rotors in tandem in which blades could be folded for storage; the relatively small rotor diameter allowed the aircraft to use aircraft carrier elevators with its blades fully extended. The tandem overlapping rotor configuration was a development by Piasecki and was used in future helicopter designs by the company and successors including the H-21, HRB-1/CH-46, and CH-47. The original HUP-1 was powered by a single Continental R-975-34 radial engine, with a take-off rating of , while later versions used the uprated R-975-42 or R-975-46A with . To aid search and rescue (SAR) operations, the aircraft was equipped with an overhead winch capable of lifting 400 lb (181 kg), which could lower a rescue sling through an electrically-operated door available after the copilot's seat was folded forward. During a flight demonstration of its capability to withstand high g-force, the type became the first helicopter to perform a loop, albeit unintentionally. Operational history H-25A Army Mule preserved in the US Army Aviation Museum, Alabama The aircraft first entered service in February 1949 with the delivery of the first of 32 HUP-1 aircraft to the US Navy. The improved HUP-2 (Piasecki designation PV-18) was soon introduced with a more powerful engine, deletion of the inward-canted horizontal stabilizer endplate fins, and various minor changes in equipment; a sub-variant equipped with dunking sonar for anti-submarine warfare was given the designation HUP-2S. The HUP-2 was the first production helicopter equipped with an autopilot. The US Navy also tested a system called Raydist that allowed an unmanned HUP-2 to be directed from a ground station and by radio ordered to hover within five feet of the desired point. Edo tested a HUP-2 with a fiberglass hull and outrigger floats for amphibious operations. An upgraded version of the HUP-2 was built for the US Army and designated as the H-25A Army Mule, but most were quickly withdrawn from Army service and converted for naval use under the designation HUP-3. In 1954, the Royal Canadian Navy received 3 former US Army H-25A aircraft, which were modified and redesignated on delivery to conform to US Navy HUP-3 standards. The aircraft were used aboard HMCS Labrador for SAR and varied utility duties, and were later used to support construction at Distant Early Warning Line radar sites. The helicopters were subsequently posted to NAF Patricia Bay and naval air station HMCS Shearwater; after the last 2 were struck off strength on 18 January 1964, 1 aircraft was donated to a technical school and the other 2 were sold as surplus. The US Army H-25 designation was adopted by the US Navy in 1962 on introduction of the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system. The final units were withdrawn from US service in 1964. It also served with French Naval Aviation (Aeronavale) from 1953 to 1965. A total of 339 aircraft were delivered during the 6-year production run. A large number of surplus US Navy aircraft later appeared on the US civil registry, and at least 7 were transferred to the French Navy. On 7 November 2009, former US Navy HUP-1, BuNo 124925, civil registration number N183YP, collided with high-voltage power lines in Adelanto, California; the subsequent crash and post-crash fire killed all 3 occupants and substantially damaged the aircraft. Operated in association with Classic Rotors, the accident aircraft was the only airworthy example in the world. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to \\"The pilot‚Äôs failure to maintain clearance from powerlines during en route flight.\\" Variants ;XHJP-1 :Prototype, powered by a Continental R-975-34 piston engine, equipped with large sloping endplate fins on the horizontal stabilizers.

Early life Payne was born near Cassville, Barry County, Missouri, in the heart of the Ozarks.. Cassville is in southwest Missouri, near the Arkansas border. Despite his relative isolation this turn-of-the-century Missouri teenager toured the world. Before Edgar was done he would crisscross the United States, travel to Mexico, Canada, and Europe, and even spend the summer in the Alps. But, like John Muir before him, and Ansel Adams after, it was the American West that most appealed to his heart. According to the U.S. Census of 1900, he resided with his parents, two sisters and five brothers in Prairie Grove, Washington County, Arkansas; his Alabama-born father was employed as a carpenter.U.S. Census of 1900, ED110, Sheet 3B. Edgar‚Äôs occupation was listed as ‚Äúcarpenter, apprentice.‚Äù Leaving home on several occasions, Payne painted houses, signs, portraits, murals, and local theater stage sets, to pay his way. Traveling through the Ozarks, then around the Southeast and Midwest, he finally wound up in Chicago, and enrolled to study portrait art at the Art Institute of Chicago. He remained only two weeks at the institute, finding it too structured. He preferred instead to be self-taught, relying on practice and his own sense of direction. Struggling at first, he soon exhibited a group of landscape works, painted on a small easel, at the Palette and Chisel Club. During this period he also obtained the occasional mural work to supplement his income. He made his way to California for the first time in 1909, at the age of 26. He spent several months painting at Laguna Beach, then headed to San Francisco. In San Francisco he met other artists, including commercial artist Elsie Palmer (1884‚Äì1971). He returned to California for a second time in 1911. When he returned to Illinois that fall, he found that Elsie had taken a job as commercial artist in Chicago. This cemented their already growing interest in each other. On the morning of their wedding day about a year later, 9 November 1912, Edgar noticed that the light was \\"perfect\\", and had Elsie postpone the ceremony until the afternoon. Luckily the artist in her offered some understanding. As a couple they became well known in Chicago's art circle. Elsie helped Edgar with his mural work, and soon he had an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago. Arguably their greatest collaborative effort happened in 1914 with the arrival of their daughter, Evelyn. Between 1915 and 1918-19 Edgar maintained a professional address in Chicago at the Tree Studio Building on East Ohio Street.American Art Annual: 12, 1915, p.445-446; 14, 1917, p.574-575; 16, 1919, p.465-466. Major breakthroughs \\"Payne Lake\\" (Steven Stern Fine Arts) The following spring they took Evelyn to see her maternal grandparents in San Francisco. They also attended the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The following year Edgar made his first trip to the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This trip was a big moment in his life, and Payne would return again and again to paint the unspoiled Sierra; these paintings remain one of the hallmarks of his work. He earned his first major commission in 1917. In a bid to attract tourism, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad asked him to paint the Southwest, along the railroads' trek from Albuquerque to California. This commission not only solidified his reputation as an artist, it also forever linked him to Western America. Although he painted in Europe, he is most remembered for his work from the Four Corners area of the Navajo Nation Reservation, Yosemite, and the California coast. That year he and Elsie spent four months painting, exploring, and taking in Canyon de Chelly. This area, from Taos, New Mexico to the Grand Canyon, became one of Payne's two main inspirations for the next twenty years. The Santa Fe Railroad commissions were the turn of the century brainchild of William H. Simpson, chief of the railway's advertising department. Starting in 1892, with Thomas Moran, Simpson exchanged travel on the train, along with lodging at railroad hotels and meals at railroad restaurants, and sometimes even cash, for paintings, photographs, pottery, and jewelry. This endeavor lasted for decades and made the Santa Fe one of the largest collectors of southwestern fine art. When the Santa Fe commission expired the couple returned to San Francisco. Edgar received a commission from the Congress Hotel in Chicago for a mural on 11,000 square yards of muslin. The mural was to cover several floors of the hallways of the hotel. Payne rented a warehouse in Glendale, California and hired other artists, including Elsie, to help complete the work. In 1918, Edgar and Elsie made their home and studio in Laguna Beach. He helped to organize the Laguna Beach Art Association, and become its first president. They spent the next four years painting their way through the southwest, in places like Canadian Rockies in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, and then exhibiting in the Los Angeles area. Sometimes their trips would involve hiking into the backcountry, looking for undisturbed places of raw and rare beauty to paint, sometimes for weeks. Edgar exhibited extensively in California, including such important venues as the California Art Club (1918-1921), California State Fair (gold medal 1918; silver medal in 1919), Cannell & Chaffin Galleries (1920), and Stendahl Galleries (1921-1922). The Paynes spent part of the summer of 1921 at the California art colony of Carmel-by-the-Sea where Edgar exhibited his work at the Fifteenth Annual Exhibition of the local Arts and Crafts Club. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (). After finding success during this period, the trio took a two-year \\"painting tour\\" of Europe, 1922-1924. Painting in Brittany, Paris, Provence, Switzerland, and Venice. His favorite place in Europe was the Alps, where he painted the Great White Peak of Mont Blanc, which the Paris Salon gave \\"an honorable mention\\" in spring 1923. \\"The Great White Peak\\" is reputed to be in the collection of Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach, California. This painting, and others, formed a collection of annual acquisitions at an art show sponsored to acquaint high school students with styles of painting and art. The collection was forgotten and distributed to various offices (and closets) in the school district. Its existence was rediscovered by school librarian John McGinnis who tracked down and restored all 56 of the missing paintings. The collection is now known as \\"The Ruth Stoever Fleming Collection\\". Upon returning the U.S. in the fall of 1924, the Paynes first stayed in Chicago, then went back to Laguna Beach, and then to New York City in 1926. Always on the go, they painted in Arizona, California, the California Sierras, Connecticut, New Mexico, New York, and Utah. They spent summers crossing the country, painting as they went. They returned to Europe to paint the harbors of Brittany, and Chioggia, in 1928. The following summer they painted Lake Louise, Alberta. Later life After the financial collapse of 1929, and the subsequent Great Depression, commissions didn‚Äôt come as easily, so the Paynes returned to Southern California on a more permanent basis, purchasing a new Los Angeles, studio-home, in 1932. During this time, Evelyn would marry, and Edgar and Elsie would become separated that same year. Edgar moved to Hollywood, to a small studio-home on Seward Street. However, he would spend a great deal of his time in the California Sierra Nevada Mountains, painting his favorite subject. His lifelong obsession with the Sierras would lead him to produce a documentary film, ‚ÄúSierra Journey‚Äù. In 1941 he wrote \\"Composition of Outdoor Painting\\", a comprehensive book on composition and composition forms. The book also explains landscape painting techniques, color, repetition, rhythm, and value. The seventh edition printing of the work was completed in 2005. After a 14-year separation, Elsie returned to help Edgar in 1946, upon learning that he had cancer. She stayed with him until he died, 8 April 1947. There is a bronze relief sculpture of Edgar at the Laguna Beach Art Museum, done by Elsie in 1952. She championed his work until her own health, and degradation of eyesight, caused her to stop in 1959. She moved in with Evelyn and her husband, in 1969, in Minneapolis. Elsie died peacefully 17 June 1971. You can find works of Payne's that are of Italian harbors, the Alps, landscapes of Laguna, but Edgar Alwin Payne is most remembered for his work of American Indians of the Four Corners area, and, of course, the paintings of his beloved Sierras. In the Sierras, high up in Humphrey's Basin, you will find the lake named for him, Payne Lake. His work was an influence on Bill Wray, John Deckert and other painters. = Galleries and collections with Payne's works = Canyon de Chelly The Hills of Altadena Laguna Coast *Steven Stern Fine Arts: Beverly Hills, California *Utah Museum of Fine Arts at the University of Utah *Chicago Art Museum *University of Nebraska Galleries *Fleischer Museum (Scottsdale, Arizona) *Indianapolis Museum of Art *Laguna Art Museum, California *Edgar Payne Gallery, California *National Academy of Design Collection *National Collection of Fine Arts, Senate Building (Washington D.C.) *Pasadena Art Institute *Pasadena Museum of California Art *Southwest Museum of Los Angeles *Springville Museum of Art (Springville, Utah) *[The Redfern Gallery, Laguna Beach, California *Edgar Payne Artwork, Laguna Beach, California *The Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento, California *The Weisman Art Museum, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota *William A.

The project was started in 2002 by Bill Kendrick who continues to maintain and improve it, with help from numerous volunteers. Tux Paint is seen by many as a free software alternative to Kid Pix, a similar proprietary educational software product.MacMerc review of Tux Paint, June 18, 2003.  History  Tux Paint was initially created for the Linux operating system, as there was no suitable drawing program for young children available for Linux at that time.Interview with Bill Kendrick of NewBreedSoftware at OSNews, August 16, 2002. It is written in the C programming language and uses various free and open source helper libraries, including the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), and has since been made available for Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, BeOS and other platforms. Selected milestone releases: * 2002.06.16 (June 16, 2002) - Initial release (brushes, stamps, lines, eraser), two days after coding started * 2002.06.30 (June 30, 2002) - First Magic tools added (blur, blocks, negative) * 2002.07.31 (July 31, 2002) - Localization support added * 0.9.11 (June 17, 2003) - Right-to-left support, UTF-8 support in Text tool * 0.9.14 (October 12, 2004) - Tux Paint Config. configuration tool released, Starter image support * 0.9.16 (October 21, 2006) - Slideshow feature, animated and directional brushes * 0.9.17 (July 1, 2007) - Arbitrary screen size and orientation support, SVG support, input method support * 0.9.18 (November 21, 2007) - Magic Tools turned into plug-ins, Pango text rendering  Features  Drawing with the Paint tool Tux Paint stands apart from typical graphics editing software (such as GIMP or Photoshop) that it was designed to be usable by children as young as 3 years of age. The user interface is meant to be intuitive, and utilizes icons, audible feedback and textual hints to help explain how the software works. The brightly colored interface, sound effects and cartoon mascot (Tux, the mascot of the Linux kernel) are meant to engage children. Tux Paint's normal interface is split into five sections: * Toolbox, containing the various basic tools (see below) and application controls (undo, save, new, print) * Canvas, where the images are drawn and edited * Color palette, where colors can be chosen (when applicable to the current tool) * Selector, providing various selectable objects (e.g., brushes, fonts or sub- tools, depending on the current tool) * Information area, where instructions, tips and encouragement are provided A simple slideshow feature allows previously saved images to be displayed as a basic flip-book animation or as a slide presentation. = Basic drawing tools = Like most popular graphics editing and composition tools, Tux Paint includes a paintbrush, an eraser, and tools to draw lines, polygonal shapes and text. Tux Paint provides multiple levels of undo and redo, allowing accidental or unwanted changes to be removed while editing a picture. = Files and printing = Tux Paint was designed in such a way that the user does not need to understand the underlying operating system or how to deal with files. The \\"Save\\" and \\"Open\\" commands were designed to mimic those of software for personal digital assistant devices, such as the Palm handheld.\\"Tux Paint Great Fun for Your Kids... If They Can Get You Off the Program!\\", Community Kids Magazine, December 2007 When one saves a picture in Tux Paint, they do not need to provide a file name or browse for where to place it. When one goes to open a previously saved picture, a collection of thumbnails of saved images is shown. Similarly, printing is typically a 'no questions asked' process, as well. = Advanced drawing tools = A drawing made with a variety of Magic Tools Tux Paint includes a number of 'filters' and 'special effects' which can be applied to a drawing, such as blurring, fading, and making the picture look as though it was drawn in chalk on pavement. These are available through the 'Magic' tool in Tux Paint. Starting with version 0.9.18, Tux Paint's 'Magic' tools are built as plugins that are loaded at runtime and use a C API specifically for creating such tools.Tux Paint 0.9.18 press release, November 21, 2007. A space scene using Tux Paint Rubber Stamps A large collection of artwork and photographic imagery are also available (under a license allowing free redistribution), and may be placed inside drawings using Tux Paint's \\"Rubber Stamp\\" tool. Stamps can be in either raster (bitmap) format (in PNG format, supporting 24bpp and full alpha transparency), or as vector graphics (in SVG format) on many platforms Tux Paint supports. As of mid-2008, over 800 stamps are included in the stamps collection. = Parental and teacher controls = Tux Paint Config., a graphical configuration tool for Tux Paint As features are added to Tux Paint, configuration options have been added that allow parents and teachers to disable features and alter the behavior to better suit their children's or students' needs, or to better integrate the software in their home or school computing environment. Typical options, such as enabling or disabling sound effects and full-screen mode are available. There are also options that help make Tux Paint suitable for younger or disabled children, such as displaying text using only uppercase letters or ignoring the distinction between buttons on the mouse. = Localization = Tux Paint has been translated into numerous languages, and has support for the display of text in languages that use non- Latin character sets, such as Japanese, Greek, or Telugu. As of June 2008, over 80 languages are supported.\\"Help Us Translate\\" page at Tux Paint website Correct support for complex languages requires Pango. Sound effects and descriptive sounds for stamp imagery can also be localized. Tux Paint includes its own form of input method support, allowing entry of non-Latin characters using the 'Text' tool. Japanese (Romanized Hiragana and Romanized Katakana), Korean (Hangul 2-bul) and Traditional Chinese are currently supported.  Distribution  \\"Golden Gate Bridge\\", drawn using Tux Paint Tux Paint is included with the software that comes with the ASUS Eee PC. It is also a standard package in educationally oriented Linux distributions, such as Debian Jr. and Edubuntu, as an optional package in numerous other Linux distributions, as well as part of numerous educationally oriented Linux Live CDs. It is included in various software collections for Windows (such as GNUWin II and Open Source Software CD), as well as in portable software collections for Windows, since it can be run as a stand-alone application (without needing to be installed system-wide). Tux Paint is also available as an activity within the free and open source educational suite GCompris.

He played for FC Nantes, Stade Rennais, RC Lens, FC Sion in Switzerland, and FC Lorient. Club career =Nantes= Monterrubio started his professional career at Nantes in 1996. Product of the famed \\"Centre of Formation\\" of Nantes, he was in the same crop of players such as Micka√´l Landreau. He was an essential part of the squad in the 1998‚Äì99 season, and his winning penalty handed Nantes the Coupe de France title in 1999. He also scored the winning goal in the 1999 Troph√©e des Champions and played as a substitute when Nantes won the 2000 Coupe de France Final. Finally, in 2001, Monterrubio became a Ligue 1 winner with Les Canaries. =Stade Rennais= In the summer of 2001, Monterrubio signed for fierce rivals Stade Rennais. Despite having a quiet start to his spell at the club, he became one of their key players, establishing a deadly partnership with Swiss striker Alexander Frei, now of FC Basel 1893. In the 2004‚Äì05 season, he led Ligue 1 in assists while Frei was the top scorer. Such was his influence, that he has inherited the captain's armband from Cyril Jeunechamp. =Lens= In the last few hours of the January 2007 transfer window, Monterrubio signed for RC Lens as a replacement for Olivier Thomert, who moved in the opposite direction. On 3 February 2007, he played his first Ligue 1 match for Lens against Valenciennes. During this period, he had to fight for his first team place with the Ivorian midfielder Kanga Akal√©. He struck up a strong partnership with Nadir Belhadj upon the Algerian left-back's arrival at the club in January 2008, but the team were relegated to Ligue 2 at the end of the season despite Monterrubio's fine form.http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11807_3578252,00.html Sky Sports' Ligue 1 Round-up, 18 May 2008 =Sion= Monterrubio signed a two-year contract with Swiss side FC Sion during the summer of 2008. RC Lens News =Lorient= On 28 June 2009, he signed a contract between 30 June 2011 with FC Lorient leaving Sion after one year. International career Born in France, Monterrubio is of Spanish descent. In his prime, Monterrubio was among the finest players of his unique kind. Although he did not win a single national team cap, he did receive three call-ups to the France B team, scoring in all 3 of his appearances. Style Monterrubio was an accomplished left winger, but had also been featured as a striker and attacking midfielder in the early of his career. He specialized in set-pieces, especially at penalty- taking. He led Ligue 1 in assists in 2004‚Äì05 and 2005‚Äì06 and was runner-up in 2006‚Äì07.

Professional career  He was the soundman for rock group Phish prior to the band's breakup in 2004. https://jambands.com/news/2009/02/19/paul-languedoc-to-retire-from-the-road/ Jambands.com As the band's chief sound engineer and house mixer, he recorded their double-CD A Live One, and all 20 volumes of the Live Phish Series. He also built guitars and basses for Trey Anastasio and Mike Gordon. A luthier by trade, he built his first guitar when he was 18 years old. https://jambands.com/features/2014/08/26/paul-languedoc-mixes-it-up-from-the- archives-august-1999/ Jambands.com He later spent four years working for Alan Stack at Time Guitars in Burlington, Vermont, and by the time he had joined Phish in 1986 at age 28, he had built hundreds of instruments. Since then, he has built only for Anastasio and Gordon, and his original designs have given Phish its own unique instrumental identity. Languedoc has a preference for European hardwoods of the types used for building cellos, specializing in inlay work in mother-of-pearl and abalone. Languedoc first worked with Phish on October 15, 1986, at a concert at Hunt's in Burlington, Vermont. He took part in some of the band's earliest tours. Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/rocky-mountain-high-the-untold-story-of- phish-s-archival-release-colorado-8/ RelixHe remained with the band until their 2004-2009 hiatus, when Phish resumed touring and recording in 2009, Paul Languedoc declined to join them, deciding to retire from the road to focus on his luthier duties. In March 2009, Garry Brown took over the task of soundman for Phish. Gordon says Languedoc's striking instruments are only one aspect of the many talents he brings to the Phish sound. \\"We're really lucky to have Paul. He gives us the freedom to do our own thing.\\"  Guitars  Named for its intricate headstock inlay, the Dragon bass (built in 1989) has a five- piece curly-maple neck and a bound ebony fingerboard. The body is solid koa, with a face of curly-maple veneer. The guitar bridge and machine heads were made by Schaller. Mike Gordon custom-ordered the instrument's active, 18-volt M√∏rch pickups from Denmark; they came with myriad knobs and switches Gordon didn't really want. \\"I have trouble making decisions,\\" he says. \\"I probably change my instrument settings only every two years.\\" The three larger knobs on the bass control volume (one per pickup) and pickup blend; the four micro- switches and three smaller knobs are for various midrange contours and high and low boosts. (Languedoc comments, \\"Even I don't know what they all do!\\") Gordon and Languedoc both call the Fish ‚Äî also named for its inlays ‚Äî \\"a bit of an experiment.\\" The bass, which was built about two years ago, has a two- piece curly-maple body with an interior chamber, a koa face with an f-hole and multiple-layered binding, and only one knob, which blends between the two EMG ASB-5 pickups. Mike eventually wants to add a piezo bridge transducer to accentuate the highs of the instrument's hollow body. In 2006, Paul Languedoc started Languedoc Guitars, selling handmade instruments through his web site. The guitars for sale are near replicas of the hollow-body guitar Trey Anastasio of Phish currently plays. The G2 model guitar sells for $10,000 and the G4 model sells for $7500. The G2 features two \\"F\\" holes and a pair of Seymour Duncan '59 Model humbuckers; and the G4 has a single \\"F\\" hole and a Duncan Custom 5 in the bridge position and a '59 in the neck.

The league is sanctioned by the Hockey Eastern Ontario and Hockey Canada and is a member of the Canadian Junior Hockey League. The winner of the CCHL playoffs competes for the Fred Page Cup ‚Äî the Eastern Region championship of the Canadian Junior Hockey League ‚Äî with the winners of the Quebec Junior AAA Hockey League and the Maritime Junior A Hockey League. The winner of the Fred Page Cup then moves on to compete for the national Royal Bank Cup. In July 2013, the TheHockeyWriters.com listed the CCHL as one of the ten best developmental leagues, professional or amateur, in North America.http://thehockeywriters.com/top-10-best-developmental-ice- hockey-leagues-north-america/ History The league started in 1961 as the \\"Ottawa-Hull District Junior Hockey League\\", under the sponsorship of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL), in hope of a better development program. The league has featured such NHL stars as Steve Yzerman and Larry Robinson, for which its two divisions are named. As this league was for the Ottawa District, teams out of the area were not allowed to compete, with one exemption: Pembroke. In the early years, any player in the league was automatically a member of the Montreal Canadiens, and were forced into a contract which would disallow them to sign with any other NHL team if they wanted to play in the NHL. The Canadiens also wanted the league to be strictly for development, allowing four 19-year-olds and five 18-year-olds per team with the rest of the players being 17 or younger. This was met with much anger and disappointment with players who had just reached their 20s, but the league substantially gained in popularity, and they were ignored. A notable alumnus of the league is 4-time Stanley Cup Champion Billy Smith of New York Islanders fame, a former member of the Smiths Falls Bears. In 1963, the Montreal Canadiens allowed the Chicago Blackhawks-sponsored Brockville Braves into the league. In the late 1960s, the Cornwall Royals applied to enter into what is now the Ontario Hockey League, when they were turned away, they applied to join the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and were accepted. In 1973, the Hull Festivals, also departed for the QMJHL. In 1975, the Canadian Hockey Association informed the league that they had to allow 20-year-olds into their league, as all other leagues of their calibre already were doing. In February 1966, players from the Hawkesbury Braves went on strike over coaching issues. The Braves brought in replacement players from midget and Jr. B leagues for a game against the Cornwall Royals. The Royals went on to win 43‚Äì0. It still stands as the highest margin of victory in the league to date. In 1976, the late Bryan Murray, former General Manager of the NHL's Ottawa Senators, took over as head coach of the Rockland Nationals. With Murray at the wheel, the Nationals won the leagues, the region, and then went on to win the National Championship as Centennial Cup Champions. The financial cost of the playoff run was too much for the team's backers to handle and they declared bankruptcy one disappointing season after winning it all. The Nationals have resurrected since then as a member of the Eastern Ontario Junior C Hockey League.http://www.hometeamsonline.com/hockeyteam/default.asp?username=EOJCHL After the ruling that allowed 20-year-olds to play in the league, teams began attempting to \\"buy\\" championship teams by going after former Major Junior players. The effect of this resulted in the labeling of the league as a \\"goon league\\" or \\"bush league\\" as the league got more violent. The fan base dwindled, and by 1984 there were only 5 teams left in the league, all on the verge of bankruptcy. The owners of the five teams approached the owners of Ottawa's Talisman Hotel and asked them to purchase the league. Through new management and rule changes, the league barred 20-year-olds from the Major Junior ranks, created a limit of five 20-year-olds (homegrown from the CJHL), and banned the paying of players. The new rules worked, and the league was once again successful. The league then approached the Canadian Hockey Association, and requested a new system. After the fall of the Rockland Nationals, the league realized there was a revenue problem amongst its teams. The league demanded longer regular seasons and a shorter National playdown schedule to determine the National Champion. This new system was guaranteed to increase revenue amongst all teams nationwide as they were allowed to have more home games, increasing revenue through ticket sales, and decreased the travel expenditures that forced the Rockland Nationals to fold soon after they won the National Championship. The league began flourishing, and by the early 1990s, had more than doubled. Teams that had folded during the \\"dark days\\" of the late 1970s and early 1980s came back. The league even allowed for the expansion of their first American hockey team, the Massena Americans. Also, now a member of the OHL, the Cornwall Royals moved from Cornwall. In response, the CJHL allowed the Messena Americans to move to Cornwall, hoping the Cornwall Colts could help the city fill its competitive hockey \\"void\\". The Gloucester Rangers hosted the last Centennial Cup tournament in 1995 before it was transformed into the Royal Bank Cup. The Rangers boosted NHL stars like Mathieu Dandenault and Robert Esche. The Gloucester Rangers were seconds away from defeating the Calgary Canucks in the final, until the Canucks scored a last-minute goal and won it all in overtime, to continue the drought of a CJHL team winning the National Junior \\"A\\" Championship. In 2004‚Äì05, the Central Junior Hockey League saw higher attendance figures in all arenas with the NHL lockout. All teams in the CJHL had doubled their attendance. In April 2007, it was announced that the Kemptville 73's were joining the CJHL as its 11th member team. The 73's formerly played in the Eastern Ontario Junior B Hockey League. The Cornwall Colts became the 4th team in CJHL history to play host to a Centennial/Royal Bank Cup tournament in 2008. The Colts managed to qualify for the semi-finals, but were ousted 7‚Äì1 by the Humboldt Broncos. In 2009, the Carleton Place Canadians, another former EOJBHL team, was announced as the league's 12th franchise. They began play during the 2009‚Äì10 season. At the beginning of the 2009‚Äì10 season, the league dropped the \\"A\\" from their name, switching to the Central Junior Hockey League. In February 2010, it was announced that the Smiths Falls Memorial Centre ‚Äì one of the league's oldest facilities and home to the Smiths Falls Bears was staging its final home game of the 2009‚Äì10 season. The Bears will be moving into a brand-new multipurpose facility for that fall. The Memorial Centre was demolished to accommodate parking spaces for the new facility. In April 2010, the Pembroke Lumber Kings made CJHL history by winning four-consecutive Art Bogart Cup championships, which is now the most-consecutive championships won by a CJHL team, however the Pembroke Lumber Kings qualified for the Fred Page Cup for the fifth consecutive year, but lost the finals to the Brockville Braves, who advanced to the Royal Bank Cup in Dauphin, Manitoba. The 2012 Fred Page Cup was awarded to the Kanata Stallions to commemorate their 25 years of Jr. A hockey in Kanata. On April 26, 2010, the league rebranded by changing their league to the Central Hockey League, from the Central Junior Hockey League. A league, by the same name \\"Central Hockey League\\" already existed, a minor professional league below the ECHL, which was 15 teams throughout the mid-western United States. In January 2011, the league rebranded itself again the Central Canada Hockey League. On May 8, 2011, at the 2011 Royal Bank Cup in Camrose, Alberta, the Pembroke Lumber Kings defeated the BCHL's Vernon Vipers 2‚Äì0 to win the CCHL's second ever National Title during the league's 50th anniversary season. Prior to the 2014‚Äì15 season, the CCHL announced it was adapting the American Hockey League's overtime format. *Following tied games, teams will remain at the 3rd period ends and 7:00 minutes will be placed on the clock after a 30-second break. Each team will receive 1 point. *The first 3 minutes of over time will be played 4 on 4. At the first whistle after 3 minutes (i.e. if the clock reads 4:00 or less) the teams will play 3 on 3. The same penalty regulations apply. The games are again sudden victory with the first team to score collects an additional point. *In the event the game remains tied after the conclusion of seven minutes of overtime, a 30-second break during which the team coaches will provide a list of 3 shooters will precede a shoot out. Home teams shall determine if they shoot first or second. If the score after 3 rounds of shooters remains tied, there will be a continued sudden death single round shoot out until a winner is declared. *No shooter may shoot twice until all eligible shooters have shot once. *Players in the penalty box at the conclusion of overtime shall not be eligible to participate in the shoot out. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, 69 CCHL regular season games were tied after regulation. The outcome of 30 games was determined in the over time session and 39 games required a shoot out. For the 2015‚Äì16 the CCHL made a significant move to the development model for the league. The Eastern Ontario Junior B Hockey League was aligned directly with the CCHL to establish direct affiliations and specific guidelines for players to move up and down between leagues. The EOJBHL also took on a re-branding to become the Central Canada Hockey League Tier 2. The development model is also to be extended to affiliation with midget (under18) teams. In fall 2016, the Gloucester Rangers were sold to new ownership, who will relocate the team to Rockland, Ontario for the 2017‚Äì18 season and become the Rockland Nationals. The current Rockland Nationals, who currently play in the National Capital Junior Hockey League are expected to relocate to a nearby community to accommodate junior A hockey in the community for the first time since 1977. The Rockland Nationals expect to develop and renew their geographical rivalry with the Hawkesbury Hawks, and also develop a rivalry with the Cumberland Grads. =David Frost incident= David Frost, the agent of former St. Louis Blues player Mike Danton, was banned from all Central Junior \\"A\\" Hockey League games and events in fall 2005 after Frost entered an off-limits-to-fans area at the Jim Durrell Arena, home to the Ottawa Jr. Senators, in which Frost \\"accosted, harassed and threatened an official of the CJHL\\". League commissioner Mac MacLean stated \\"We don't want him around period\\". The Lumber Kings were fined $1000 for David Frost's actions, because the league considered Frost to be associated with owner Sheldon Keefe. MacLean sent posters to each league arena to help security staff identify Frost if he were to show up at games, and to refuse entry to Frost. Weeks later, the ban was lifted after Mac MacLean was relieved of his duties of CJHL commissioner. Newly appointed commissioner John Comerford lifted the ban, stating \\"We can't stop David Frost from entering the rink and I haven't received any complaints from anybody about him\\". League's former vice president, who was fired tried to extend the ban throughout the 2005‚Äì06 season. David Frost had no affiliation with the Pembroke Lumber Kings hockey organization. He was allowed to attend league games, but was barred from restricted areas. Frost disregarded the advisement not to entire restricted areas, and was seen getting off the Lumber Kings team bus by CBC Fifth Estate film crew, and was filmed following the team to dressing room during a playoff game in Nepean. At the end of the season, David Frost severed un-affiliated ties with the league and informed that he would not attend any more league games or events.

born 23 June 1612 in Einbeck, died 25 October 1676 in Wolfenb√ºttel) was a leading figure of the German Baroque, best known for his publications on German grammar, language theory and poetics. Life Justus- Georg Schottelius was born in Einbeck, which in 1612 was a Low German-speaking area. He was the son of a Lutheran pastor; his mother came from a merchant family. Justus-Georg regularly styled himself Schottelius, and this must be regarded as the correct form of his name, though after his death the de- Latinized form Schottel long persisted in scholarly writings and is still sometimes used. Surmounting the many upheavals of the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì48) and the untimely death of his father, Schottelius managed to acquire a good education, notably at the Akademisches Gymnasium in Hamburg and at the universities of Groningen, Leiden, Leipzig and Wittenberg. In 1640 he found employment as tutor to the children of Duke August the Younger of Braunschweig-L√ºneburg (1579‚Äì1666), including August's heir, Anton Ulrich (1633‚Äì1714). Schottelius wrote several plays for his pupils to perform, some with musical accompaniments composed by August's consort, Sophie Elisabeth, or in one case by Heinrich Sch√ºtz (1585‚Äì1672). In 1646 he married Anna Margarete Eleonore Cleve, but she died the following year. His second wife, whom he married in 1649, was Anna Margarete Sobbe. During the 1640s and 1650s Schottelius rose to prominent administrative positions at court. He also had access to the magnificent ducal library at Wolfenb√ºttel, and he continued to reside in that town until his death. Schottelius quickly established himself in the early 1640s as a powerful protagonist of the German language. Admitted in 1642 to the leading patriotic language society, the Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft or 'Fructifying Society', Schottelius took as his society name Der Suchende ('The Seeker'), engaging vigorously in its controversies on fundamentals of grammar and lexical purity. In 1645 or 1646 he became a member of the Pegnesischer Blumenorden, headed in N√ºrnberg by Georg Philipp Harsd√∂rffer (1607‚Äì1658) and later Sigmund von Birken (1626‚Äì1681). In 1646 he obtained a doctorate in laws at the University of Helmstedt.For further biographical details, see: Hecht (1995); D√ºnnhaupt (1991), pp. 3824ff.; Moulin-Fankh√§nel (1997), p. 277; McLelland (2011), pp. 4ff. Achievements as a writer Ausf√ºhrliche Arbeit Von der Teutschen HaubtSprache, 1663 Though he also distinguished himself in the fields of poetry, poetic theory and drama, Schottelius is chiefly memorable for his insights and achievements as a linguist. Acting like many of his contemporaries in a spirit of cultural and linguistic patriotism. he sought to raise the lowly status of German, to celebrate its high antiquity, to defend it against latter-day foreign influences, to re-examine it in the light of current linguistic theory, to promote its refinement and use as a communicative medium, and ultimately to inaugurate a new, prestigious epoch in the language. This process was known among contemporaries as Spracharbeit. For his d√©but as a language reformer, Schottelius chose a poetic medium. His Lamentatio Germaniae exspirantis (1640) attacked in stately alexandrines and lurid metaphors the corrupt state of the language, in particular the burgeoning over-use of foreign words.On 17th- century German puristic discourse, see, for example, Jones (1999), pp. 25-83. In a dying lament, the once fair nymph Germania presents herself as a grotesque hag. Venerated down the ages, and even meriting the crown of Europe, she now prostitutes herself, begging words from French, Spanish, Italian and English.Schottelius reprinted the poem (with his own annotations) in Ausf√ºhrliche Arbeit, pp. 1012-1028. For all his potent rhetoric, Schottelius's linguistic purism was of a somewhat moderate kind, when compared with his contemporary Philipp von Zesen (1619‚Äì1689). But his championship of the German language was without equal. =Ausf√ºhrliche Arbeit Von der Teutschen HaubtSprache= Schottelius's magnum opus, his Ausf√ºhrliche Arbeit Von der Teutschen HaubtSprache, appeared in 1663. Running to over 1,500 pages, it incorporated substantial amounts of material that had appeared earlier, notably in his Teutsche Sprachkunst of 1641. Aimed at a learned, international readership, with much use of Latin alongside German, the Ausf√ºhrliche Arbeit is a compendium of remarkable range and depth. Combining many discourse traditions, it embraces language history, orthography, accidence, word- formation, idioms, proverbs, syntax, versification, onomastics and other features, including a dictionary of more than 10,000 German root-words . Heading the work (pp. 1‚Äì170) are ten so-called eulogies (Lobreden): these are massively documented, programmatic statements characterising many aspects of the German language, past and present, and claiming for it the status of a 'cardinal' language (Hauptsprache) alongside Latin, Greek and Hebrew. One key argument here was the German language's rich lexical productivity, its ability to combine root-words (Wurtzeln, Stammw√∂rter, mostly monosyllabic) and affixes (Hauptendungen) in ways which gave it unique and infinite powers of expression. To depict nature in all her variety, it had, for example, the means to name hundreds of different colours, as Schottelius showed in some detail. Seeking to demonstrate that the German language had a rational basis, Schottelius based his grammar partly on the Classical principle of analogy, identifying (and sometimes even artificially creating) patterns of regularity or similarity in spelling and grammatical inflection. But as a grammarian he also acknowledged countless anomalies or irregularities in the language, and he respected written usage in what he regarded as its most exemplary forms. In the 17th century, German was still in the long and difficult process of becoming standardized or codified. Influential here was Schottelius's own conception of High German as a language transcending the many dialects, and as currently used in writing by 'learned, wise and experienced men' (viri docti, sapientes et periti). Schottelius argued distinctively that this idealized, supra-regional form of German could not be acquired spontaneously, and certainly not from speech: it had to be 'learnt through much diligence and toil' (durch viel Fleis und Arbeit ... erlernet). =Legacy= Schottelius‚Äôs truly 'comprehensive' work dominated the German linguistic field until Johann Christoph Gottsched (1700-1766), whose authoritative grammars appeared from 1748 onwards. Schottelius's wider legacy has been variously assessed, but it lies mainly in the development of linguistic ideas, with measurable influences to be found in early grammars of Danish, Dutch, Swedish and Russian, and in theoretical writings on these and other languages.

They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium, or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus. Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400Stanƒç√≠k, D. and P. M. Peterson. (2007).

Clinical Reviews in Allergy and Immunology 21(2) 261-92. Taxonomy The genus Festuca represents a major evolutionary line of the tribe Poeae. The ancient group has produced various segregates that possess more advanced characteristics than Festuca, including racemose inflorescences and more annual habits. The word \\"festuca\\" is a Latin word meaning \\"stem\\" or \\"stalk\\" first used by Pliny the Elder to describe a weed. The word Festuca first appears to describe grasses in Dodoens' \\"Stirpium historiae pemptades sex, sive libri XXX\\" in 1583. However, the plant Dodoens described as Festuca altera is truly Bromus secalinus. Other authors before Linnaeus used the name to describe other various species of Bromus. In the first edition of \\"Genera Plantarum\\", Linnaeus describes seven species of Festuca, five of which are truly Bromus grasses with the other two being Festuca gigantea and Festuca pratensis. In 1753 the genus is accepted as first being formally described, in Linnaeus' \\"Species Plantarum\\". Eleven species were described, with F. ovina being the type species. Of these eleven, one species was Danthonia, one Poa, and one Koeleria. The first major monograph on the genus was Hackel's \\"Monographia Festucarum Europaearum\\" in 1882. Since Linnaeus' publications, seven genera have been proposed for groups of perennial fescues and fifteen for annual fescues, all with varying degrees of acceptance. For example, in 1906 the subgenus Vulpia was introduced for North American species. The annual habit and shorter anthers of Vulpia has since been enough to distinguish Vulpia as a separate genus from Festuca. The taxonomy of the genus is ultimately problematic and controversial, as evidenced by the large number of small genera closely related to Festuca. Often distinguishing species within the genus requires the analysis of highly specific morphological differences on characters such as ovary pubescence or leaf sclerenchyma patterns. This distribution of sclerenchyma tissue is an important distinguishing character between species, and though species can be locally distinguished without analyzing these characteristics, to distinguish the genus as a whole the analysis is necessary. Description Festuca grasses are perennial and bisexual plants that are densely to loosely cespitose. The some grasses are rhizomatous and some lack rhizomes, and rarely species are stoloniferous. The culms of the grasses are typically glabrous and smooth, though some species have scabrous culms or culms that are pubescent below the inflorescences. The leaf sheaths range from open to the base to closed to the top. Some species have sheaths that persist over years and typically have deciduous blades, and some species have sheaths that quickly shred into fibers and decay in senescence and typically have blades that are not deciduous. Species lack auricles. The membranous ligules measure and are typically longest at the margins. The ligules are typically truncate and ciliate, though they can occasionally be acute or erose. The flat and conduplicate leaf blades are involute or convolute and are sometimes glaucous or pruinose. The abaxial surfaces of leaf blades are glabrous or scabrous and occasionally pubescent or puberulent. The adaxial surfaces of leaf blades are typically scabrous, though occasionally are hirsute or puberulent. The abaxial sclerenchyma tissue forms longitudinal strands that vary in presence from the margins and opposite of the midvein to adjacent to some or every lateral vein. These longitudinal strands occasionally merge into interrupted or continuous bands. Bands of confluent strands that reach veins are known as \\"pillars\\". The adaxial sclerenchyma tissue sometimes forms strands that are opposite or extend to epidermal veins. Some strands form \\"girders\\" together with the abaxial sclerenchyma tissue that connect epidermides at some or all veins. The inflorescences of species are open or contracted panicles, occasionally racemes, with one to two (rarely three) branches at their lower node. The branches are erect and begin to spread during anthesis, and occasionally lower branches are reflexed. The spikelets have two to twelve mostly bisexual florets. The rachillas are typically either scabrous or pubescent, but can occasionally be smooth and glabrous. The subequal or unequal glumes are ovate to lanceolate, acute to acuminate, and are typically exceeded by the florets. The lower glumes are as long or shorter than their adjacent lemmas and have one (rarely two or three) veins, and the upper glumes have three (rarely four or five) veins. The calli are typically glabrous and smooth, but can be occasionally scabrous or rarely pubescent. The chartaceous or sometimes coriaceous lemmas have somewhat dorsally rounded and distally keeled bases. The lemmas typically have five (rarely six or seven) veins. The lemmas have acute to attenuate apices that are occasionally doubly pointed, and terminal awns or mucros. The bidentate paleas are shorter to longer than the lemmas, with scabrous-ciliate veins. The regions between the veins are smooth and glabrous near the base of the paleas and become scabrous or puberulent distally. All grasses have three anthers. The ovaries are glabrous with occasionally hispidulous apices on which hairs persist when ovaries become caryopses. The oblong caryopses have adaxial grooves. The linear hila vary in length from half as long to as long as the caryopses. Uses Some fescues are used as ornamental and turf grasses and as pasture and hay for livestock, being a highly nutritious stock feed. Festuca rubra and F. rubra subsp. commutata are used as lawn grasses, and these species, F. arundinacea, and F. trachyphylla are used in parks, deforested areas, and sports fields for land stabilization. F. saximontana and F. idahoensis are used as rangeland grasses for livestock, and fescues often provide good forage for native wildlife. F. ovina and its various subspecies are the most important grazing fescues for North America, and F. arundinacea is one of the most important hay and pasture grasses in Europe. Fescue is easily established on bare ground, outcompeting other plants and persisting over several years, and so is often used in soil erosion control programs. Tall fescue (F. arundinacea) is good for this purpose, and one cultivar, 'Kentucky 31', was used in land reclamation during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s in the US. Fescues have been used as building material, as rope and as a variety of other things in indigenous Ethiopian communities, in particular the Guassa Community Conservation Area where it is referred to as 'Guassa Grass'.Ashenafi, Z. T., & Leader-Williams, N. (2005). Indigenous common property resource management in the central highlands of Ethiopia. Human Ecology, 33(4), 539-563 The grasses F. amethystina, F. cinerea, F. elegans, F. glauca, and F. pallens are all grown as ornamentals. Fescue is sometimes used as feed for horses. However, fescue poisoning, caused by ergot alkaloids produced by the endophytic fungus Epichlo√´ coenophiala, is a risk for pregnant mares. During the last three months of pregnancy fescue poisoning increases the risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirths, retained placenta, absent milk production, and prolonged pregnancy. Incorporating legumes into the fescue can be a way to increase livestock gains and conception rates, even if the fescue is infected.Fescue Toxicosis. Ohio State University Extension.

It is located in downtown Pasadena between Colorado Boulevard to the north and Green Street to the south. Paseo Colorado is just east of and connected by a pedestrian bridge, the Garfield Promenade, to Old Town Pasadena, and west of the center of downtown. The mall is located across Green Street from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in the Pasadena Conference Center. As of 2014, the mall is currently without an anchor retail chain stores since both Macy's and a Gelson's Markets had closed in 2013. History The site was originally occupied by a shopping mall called Plaza Pasadena, which opened in 1980 and featured three anchor stores: J.C. Penney, The Broadway, and May Company California. Alternate Link via ProQuest. It was built by The Hahn Company at a cost of $115 million on an 11-acre site and had featured over 120 stores. Alternate Link via ProQuest. The development was designed by Charles Kober & Associates and the resulting design was awarded a Progressive Architecture Magazine Design Award in 1979. This mall did not live up to expectations. May Company closed its store there in 1989, and the space was divided among smaller stores. In 1998, following the conversion of the Broadway store to Macy's and the closure of J.C. Penney, the developers announced plans to tear down the mall and replace it with an outdoor center. Paseo Colorado opened in September 2001, retaining the Macy's store from the original development and added a supermarket and movie theater complex. Two years later, the outdoor center was sold to Developers Diversified Realty Corp. for $114 million. In November 2010, the Paseo Colorado saw the opening of Noor, a 16,000 sq ft event space featuring state-of-the-art audio/visual and lighting and seating for up to 350 guests for banquets in its large ballroom, the Sofia, and 140 guests for banquets in its smaller ballroom, the Ella. On January 3, 2013, Macy's announced their store at Paseo Colorado would close in early spring 2013. At the time of the store closure, there were plans to demolish the Macy's building and replace it with a multi-story hotel. In March 2013, Gelson's announced that they would close their store at Paseo Colorado on July 21, 2013. This store had been at this location since Paseo Colorado first opened 12 years prior. By late 2014, the mall was in the process of obtaining the necessary local governmental licenses to replace the vacant Macy's Department Store with a Hyatt Place hotel and mixed-use condominium complex. After obtaining the necessary permits, DDR began the demolition process in August 2015. In January 2016, DDR sold the retail development to Cypress Equities of Dallas.

Until 2020, the first sale of agriculture produce could occur only at the market yards (mandis) of APMC. However after the Farmers‚Äô Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 came into force it allows farmers to sell outside APMC mandis in India. History The concept of agriculture produce market regulation programme in India dates back to British period as raw cotton was the first farm produce to attract the attention of the Government due to anxiety of British rulers to make available the supplies of pure cotton at reasonable prices to the textile mills of Manchester (UK). Consequently, first regulated market (Karanja) under Hyderabad Residency Order was established in 1886 in the Country and the first legislation was the Berar Cotton and Grain Market Act of 1887, which empowered British Resident to declare any place in the assigned district a market for sale and purchase of agricultural produce and constitute a committee to supervise the regulated markets. This Act became the model for enactment in other parts of the country. An important landmark in the agricultural marketing scene in the country has been the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Agriculture, 1928 for regulation of marketing practices and establishment of regulated markets. One of the measures taken to improve the situation was to regulate the trade practices and to establish market yards in the countryside. In pursuance, Government of India prepared a Model Bill in 1938 and circulated to all the States but not much headway was made till independence. Later, most of the States enacted Agricultural Produce Markets Regulation (APMR) Acts during sixties and seventies and put these in operation. All primary wholesale assembling markets were brought under the ambit of these Acts. Well laid out market yards and sub-yards were constructed and for each market area, an Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) was constituted to frame the rules and enforce them. Thus, the organized agricultural marketing came into existence through regulated markets. Background Prior to independence, the major concern of the Government policy related to agricultural marketing was to keep the prices of food for the consumers and agro-raw materials for the industry in check. However, after independence, the need to protect the interest of farmers and to provide them incentive prices to augment the production of agricultural commodities was also felt. Further, problems of local money lenders extorting high amounts of foodgrains from the farmer, at throwaway prices, as interest were common throughout the country. Recognizing the defects like losses to the farmers in terms of undue low prices, higher costs of marketing and considerable physical losses of the produce in the agricultural marketing system which the farmers had to face, the Government, with a view to establishing a mechanism to monitor the market conduct, introduced from time to time several mandatory regulations. Regulation and development of primary agricultural produce markets was taken up as an institutional innovation and construction of well laid out market yards was considered as an essential requirement for regulating the practices in primary wholesale markets. Principles APMCs operate on two principles: # Ensure that farmers are not exploited by intermediaries (or money lenders) who compel farmers to sell their produce at the farm gate for an extremely low price. # All food produce should first be brought to a market yard and then sold through auction. Features Each state which operates APMC markets geographically divide the state. Markets (mandis) are established at different places within the state. Farmers are required to sell their produce via auction at the mandi in their region. Traders require a license to operate within a mandi. Wholesale and retail traders (e.g. shopping mall owners) and food processing companies cannot buy produce directly from a farmer. Some of the salient features of the APMC Model Act 2003 are as follows 1) Facilitates contract farming model. 2) Special market for perishables. 3) Farmers, private persons can set up own market. 4) Licensing norms relaxed. 5) Single market fee. 6) APMC revenue to be used for improving market infrastructure. However, not all states have passed the bill. Some states have passed but neither framed rules nor notified it. Thus, inter- state barriers continue. Further, Union Budget 2015 proposed to create United National Agriculture Market with the help of State Government and NITI Ayog. Examples within states =Madhya Pradesh= The state government has taken several initiatives so that farmers may get a better price for their produce. =Karnataka= The state government of Karnataka has created APMCs in many towns to enable farmers to sell their produce at reasonable prices. Most APMCs have a market where traders and other marketing agents are provided stalls and shops to purchase agriculture produce from farmers. Farmers can sell their produce to agents or traders under the supervision of the APMC. Farmers cannot sell produce outside the APMC mechanism. However, the government is now encouraging direct selling through 'Rythu Bazar' or to supermarkets directly. The present APMC system makes farmers vulnerable to traders' and marketing agents' price manipulations. The Government of India is considering improving the APMC Act to benefit all parties involved. =Maharashtra= The Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board runs 295 APMCs in Maharashtra, under the APMC Act enacted by the Government of India. In July, 2016, the Maharashtra State Government removed fruits and vegetables from the purview of the APMCs. The state government has urged the farmers to directly bring their produce for sale in Mumbai. Of the 307 APMCs in the state, 219 are operating, The government has granted 148 Direct Marketing Licenses of which 91 are for fruits and vegetables. The Pune APMC, meanwhile, appealed to the farmers from the state as well as from outside to bring their produce to the market and sell those directly.. =Tamil Nadu= In Tamil Nadu, the Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Marketing Board is the regulatory board for agricultural markets which is successfully running since 1977. 21 Market committees are established for every notified area and 277 Regulated Markets are functioning under these committees for better regulation of buying and selling of agricultural produce. =Andhra Pradesh= The Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Markets act G.O (Government Order) was passed in the year 1966 and rules were amended in the year 1969.http://market.ap.nic.in/html/Market_Rules.html Reforms Reforms have been passed by the Government of India in form of 3 acts, namely the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities Amendment Act, 2020. These bills look to break the monopoly of middlemen in APMCs and create a free market. Cartelization has been a big problem in these APMCs. But these bills have been met with skepticism by the opposition and the farmers because they fear these laws will lead to degradation of APMCs and eventually Minimum support price (India) will be diluted. This has led to protests by farmers in Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh.

In general, if the behaviour of a system of more than two objects cannot be described by the two-body interactions between all possible pairs, as a first approximation, the deviation is mainly due to a three-body force. The fundamental strong interaction does exhibit such behaviour, the most important example being the stability experimentally observed for the helium-3 isotope, which can be described as a 3-body quantum cluster entity of two protons and one neutron [PNP] in stable superposition. Direct evidence of a 3-body force in helium-3 is known: . The existence of stable [PNP] cluster calls into question models of the atomic nucleus that restrict nucleon interactions within shells to 2-body phenomenon. The three- nucleon-interaction is fundamentally possible because gluons, the mediators of the strong interaction, can couple to themselves. In particle physics, the interactions between the three quarks that compose hadrons can be described in a diquark model which might be equivalent to the hypothesis of a three-body force. There is growing evidence in the field of nuclear physics that three- body forces exist among the nucleons inside atomic nuclei for many different isotopes (three-nucleon force).

It was founded on 20 September 1909 with 10 students on its original site at Lagos Island, adjacent to Tafawa Balewa Square. The school admits only male students although historically some female HSC (A-Level equivalent) students were admitted before the establishment of Queen's College Lagos, popularly known as King's College's sister school. King's College conducts exams for the West African School-Leaving Certificate and the National Examinations Council. History In 1908, the Nigerian Acting Director of Education in Lagos, Henry Rawlingson Carr advised Governor Walter Egerton on a detailed scheme of education in Lagos. Carr's suggestions and proposals were the basis for the formation of King's College. Carr convinced the London Board of Education that King's College's education mission would not overlap but supplement the education initiatives of missionary societies. As a result, some authors regard Henry Carr as the \\"architect of King's College\\". On 20 September 1909 King‚Äôs School (as it was then called) came into being. There were 10 pioneer students which included J.C. Vaughan, Isaac Ladipo Oluwole, Frank Macaulay, Herbert Mills (from the Gold Coast), O.A. Omololu and Moses King. Oluwole was the first senior prefect of the school. The school building was erected and furnished at a cost of ¬£10,001. It consists of a hall to accommodate 300 students, 8 lecture rooms, a chemical laboratory and an office. The philosophy of King‚Äôs School was > ‚Äúto provide for the youth of the colony a higher general education than that > supplied by the existing Schools, to prepare them for Matriculation > Examination of the University of London and to give a useful course of Study > to those who intend to qualify for Professional life or to enter Government > or Mercantile service.‚Äù The staff of the college consists of three Europeans (a principal who gives instruction in English Language, Literature and Latin, a Mathematical and Science Master) with two African assistant teachers. Occasionally, members of the Education Department were engaged as lectures of the evening classes. The government awarded three scholarships and three exhibitions annually based on merit. The beneficiaries of the scholarships are entitled to free tuition and a government grant of 6 pounds per annum. Conversely, holders of exhibitions receive free tuition; only Hussey Charity Exhibitions tenable at the college was established for indigent students out of the investment proceeds of the premises of the defunct Hussey Charity. The average attendance of students as at the end of 1910 was 16. This rose to 67 as at the end of 1914. In 1926, The Development of the Education Department, 1882‚Äì1925 was published. Chapter 1, \\"Annual Report on the Education Development, Southern Provinces, Nigeria, for the year 1926\\" unearthed interesting facts about the school. It reads, in part, \\"‚Ä¶1909 is chiefly noticeable for the opening of King‚Äôs College as a Government Secondary School under the headmastership of a Mr. Lomax who was seconded from the Survey Department, and who was assisted by two European Masters. The number of boys on the roll was 11. In 1909, Mr. Hyde-Johnson was appointed headmaster of King‚Äôs College, but nine months later, he succeeded Mr. Rowden as Director of Education‚Ä¶..\\" That the first headmaster of the college was Mr. Lomax is an outstanding revelation, outstanding because the general conception has always been that Mr. Hyde-Johnson who held that position. Until 1954 when the first edition of the brief history of the college was written, the popular myth was that Mr. Hyde-Johnson was the first principal of King‚Äôs College. Except for the few surviving foundation students, there was hardly any Old Boy who had ever heard of Mr. Lomax; this pioneer‚Äôs name was curiously sunk in obscurity. An insight into life at K.C. in its early years is provided by F.S. Scruby‚Äôs article dated 24 February 1924 in the Mermaid titled ‚ÄúFurther Glimpse of the Past‚Äù: :‚ÄùIt revived many memories which are never very dormant to read Ikoli‚Äôs very flattering recollections of my all too short ‚Äúregime‚Äô at K.C. Having taught the young Australian out in the ‚ÄúBush‚Äô in sunny New South Wales and spent holidays in Fiji and the Pacific Islands, it was the pleasurable anticipation that I came to Lagos and was a great disappointment to me to have to resign the post so soon. :‚ÄòIt is a curious thing that Ikoli should have noticed that some boys run the risk of being spoiled. To this day Old Boys from Schools in which I taught in England before going to Lagos remind me of the lasting impression that was made on them when they showed any symptoms of such deterioration. The feasts so generously described in the December number were really only meeting s of the Matriculation class- Oluwole, Vaughan and Macaulay- who use to come up to my quarters once or twice a week to read Shakespeare. :\\"In looking back on the Physical Training, I am afraid Okoli has taken off his rose-coloured spectacles. The Sergeant of the W.A.R.F.F. who used to come and give lessons were really not very old on peppery. He was a very good Instructor and very fond of boys but the fact remains that P.T. was not popular, and one small boy in particular used to come and report to me regularly that he was ‚Äòsore- footed‚Äô, and take his big dose from the bottle and an hour‚Äôs work as well. It was my great ambition that a cadet Company should be formed at K.C. as the first company of a Lagos Cadet Battalion School were circularized by the Education Department, but the scheme fell through. :\\"It is a great joy though it is not a matter of Surprise to know that K.C. has prospered during the last 13 years with the development of the House System and Inter-house Sports.\\" Organization =Houses and classes= There are four houses in the school named after former principals. Hyde-Johnson's House (red), Panes' House (blue), Mckee-Wright's House (yellow) and Harman's House (green). It has ten arms per class (as of the 2017- 2018 session), They are A, Alpha, C, D, E, F, G, H , J and K. King's College Lagos makes use of the Greek letter Alpha instead of the letter B as the second arm of their classes. =Campuses= Due to population constraints, the school was divided into two campuses, with the senior school moving into the premises of the former Federal School for Arts and Sciences (F.S.A.S) on Victoria Island. (The school administration was still under the control of one principal and ultimately under the control of the Federal Ministry of Education.) This meant that the senior classes of the school (classes 1‚Äì3) were now in the Victoria Island \\"Annex,\\" as that campus came to be known. Presently, King's College, Lagos has junior school. The seniors are now split as follows: SS1 to SS3 boys are found in the Main Camp (Tafawa Balewa Square), while JSS1 to JSS2 boys are found in the annex campus (Victoria Island) The former PKC, Otunba 'Dele Olapeju, assumed office in January, 2010 and bowed out of service in November, 2015. He moved the senior students from the annex to the main campus. Today, King's College is wearing a new look. He has erected a number of structures both at the main campus and at the annex campus. The students' results are now online, with parents and guardians being able to follow up on their children/wards' academic and extra- curricular activities using the students' log-in details which have been given to them. =Prefects= As at the 2014‚Äì2015 session, King's College Lagos had 45 prefect positions.  Education and social life of student  King's College Lagos has proved its educational quality for centuries and has passed the test of time. Unproven information reports that King's College Lagos performed at a 90% success rate in May/June 2015 WASSCE. Socially, KC proves to be one of the best, as yearly activities such as the inter-house sports competition, the annual bi-lateral games with Achimota School Ghana, and the King's College/Queen's College Graduation ball for outgoing SS3 students have become prominent social events in King's College. The annual KIGS cup is an important sporting event. It is an elite quadrangular cricket tournament with four schools participating - King's College, Igbobi College, Government College Ibadan and St. Gregory's College. The annual Ikoyi Run is also one of King's College's major sporting event. Ikoyi Run is a marathon with the four houses competing. There is also an annual inter-house athletics competition with the four houses competing. Uniform The school uniform consists of a white shirt (long-sleeved for those in the senior school and short-sleeved for those in the junior school), a school tie and/or a school badge, white trousers, black belt, socks and black laced shoes and a blue blazer. The wearing of the blazer became compulsory with Mr. S.M. Onoja, and this has made the school look more inviting to the general public.  Principals  The first principal of the school was a Sir Lomax, while the first African principal was Rex Akpofure. The current principal of the school is Ali Andrew Agada.

It is larger than the mandolin, and is the baritone instrument of the mandolin family. Its eight strings are in four paired courses, with the strings in each course tuned in unison. Overall tuning of the courses is in fifths like a mandolin, but beginning on bass C (C2). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin.Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary, by Sibyl Marcuse (Corrected Edition 1975)The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and others (2001) Construction Mandocello construction is similar to the mandolin: the mandocello body may be constructed with a bowl-shaped back according to designs of the 18th-century Vinaccia school, or with a flat (arched) back according to the designs of Gibson Guitar Corporation popularized in the United States in the early 20th century. The scale of the mandocello is longer than that of the mandolin. Gibson examples have a scale length of 24.75\\" (62.87 cm) but flat-back designs have appeared with both significantly shorter and longer scale lengths (27\\"/68.58 cm on some Vega mandocellos). Bowl-back instruments may have a shorter scale length, on the order of 22.5\\" (about 57 cm). The internal bracing also bears some similarity to the mandolin. Gibson's mandocellos were typically constructed with a single transverse brace on the top just below the oval soundhole. Modern builders also use X-bracing. As is typical of the mandolin family, mandocellos can be found with either a single oval soundhole or a pair of \\"F\\" soundholes. These instruments typically have between 18 and 22 frets; concert bowl-back instruments may have more frets permitting virtuoso passage work in the upper register. =Layout of strings= The mandocello generally has four courses of two strings each. Because of the heavy gauge of the lowest course, some folk mandocello players remove one of the C strings to prevent rattling while playing fortissimo. There is a rare 10-string/5-course mandocello, containing an additional course of strings above the 1st (highest) course, sometimes termed a liuto cantabile or liuto moderno, although these instruments remain technically mandocellos. History Like most other instruments in the mandolin family the mandocello originated in Europe. Mandolins evolved from the lute family in Italy during the 17th and 18th centuries, and the bowl back mandolin, produced particularly in Naples, became common in the 19th century. It was during the Baroque period (1600-1750) that interest in the mandolin began to increase, along with its use in ensemble playing, resulting in increased interest in developing and expanding the mandolin family. The first evidence of modern metal-string mandolins is from literature regarding popular Italian players who travelled through Europe teaching and giving concerts. Notable are Signor Gabriele Leone, Giovanni Battista Gervasio, Pietro Denis, who travelled widely between 1750 and 1810. This, together with the records gleaned from the Italian Vinaccia family of luthiers in Naples, Italy, has led musicologists to believe that the family of modern steel-string mandolins were developed in Naples by the Vinaccia family. Mandolin ensembles were popular in the late Baroque period, and a number of instruments were added to the family around this time, including the mandalone a flat-backed, bass instrument, \\"much larger than the liuto\\" with \\"four heavy wound strings\\" tuned (in fourths) to A2-D3-G3-C4. This instrument may have been the direct precursor of the mandocello. Paul Sparks, The Classical Mandolin, Oxford University Press, pages 205, 206. The popularity of mandolin ensembles began to wane during the late Classical (1750-1825) period, and after 1815 the mandolin largely transitioned to the status of a folk instrument, and the mandolone all but disappeared. It was during this decline in popularity that Pasquale Vinaccia (1806‚Äì1885) made his modifications to the instrument that his family made for generations, creating the Neapolitan mandolin. The mandolin was largely forgotten outside of Italy by that point, but the stage was set for it to become known again, starting with the Paris Exposition in 1878. Vinaccia modernized several members of the mandolin family, improving resonance, increasing ranges, and adding features. In addition to creating the Neapolitan mandolin c. 1835, he reconceived the mandalone and related instruments, which had limited range, and a much quieter tone than the treble mandolins. The Neopolitan mandocello he developed had increased volume, extended range, and effectively superseded the mandolone as the bass instrument of the mandolin family. The Mandolin \\"Estudiantina\\" of Mayenne, France around 1900 when Mandolin orchestras were at the height of their popularity Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1878, the mandolin's popularity began to rebound. In particular, the Spanish Estudiantina Figaro, an \\"association of young teachers, musicians ... created and established in Madrid forming a magnificent band of guitars, bandurrias and violins\\" attracted widespread attention. This was followed by a wave of Italian mandolinists traveling in Europe in the 1880s and 1890s, and in the United States by the mid-1880s, playing and teaching their instrument. The instrument's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in the \\"early years of the 20th century. Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime, and it became an instrument of society, taken up by young men and women. Mandolin orchestras were formed worldwide, incorporating the mandolin family of instruments‚Äîmandolins, mandolas, mandocellos, and even mandobasses‚Äîas well as guitars, double basses and zithers. Around this time, the Gibson company began building mandocellos in the style of their mandolins with arched tops and backs. Gibson is known to have produced at least four models of mandocello between 1905 and the 1920s: the K-1, K-2, K-4, and K-5. Other American instrument companies also produced mandocellos. After the 1930s the popularity of mandolin ensembles once again began to decline, though not as completely as it had in the 19th century. Mandolins continued to be produced, but production of other members of the family decreased significantly, although‚Äîwith the possible exception of the mandobass‚Äîit never died out completely.Ian Pommerenke, The Mandolin in the early to mid 19th Century, Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association Newsletter, Spring 2007. Tuning and range Usually, courses of 2 adjacent strings are doubled (tuned to the same pitch). The standard mandocello tuning of C2 C2‚Ä¢G2 G2‚Ä¢D3 D3‚Ä¢A3 A3 is equivalent to that of the violoncello: * fourth (lowest tone) course: C2 ( Hz) * third course: G2 ( Hz) * second course: D3 ( Hz) * first (highest tone) course: A3 ( Hz) The average range, therefore, is about three-and-a-half octaves, with the exact range depending on the number of frets on the individual instrument: from two octaves below middle C up to D#5/Eb5, in the octave above middle C, (with 18 frets), to as high as A5, with 24 frets. On 10-string/5-course instruments an additional string-pair, placed above the first course, is tuned to E3 E3, adding an additional half-octave or so to the upper range. Usage Gibson mandolin family: mandocello is 2nd from right, front row The bowl-back mandocello is chiefly used in mandolin orchestras and mandolin quartets, where it provides a melodic and bass role similar to the cello in a bowed string quartet. It is occasionally used as a solo instrument for the performance of classical music, such as concertos and unaccompanied repertoire originally composed for solo cello. However, some pieces specifically for liuto cantabile were composed by Raffaele Calace, who championed the instrument in the early 20th century. More recent music for solo mandocello was presented at the 2018 Classical Mandolin Society Convention in Santa Rosa. An article on this event and examples of the music appear in the CMSA Mandolin Journal. The mandocello also has a role in modern folk music, such as bluegrass or Celtic music. In this setting the flat-back mandocello is typically used. The mandocello's lower range does not produce the bright, projecting sound of the mandolin or mandola, and its use in this setting has been generally eclipsed by mandolin artists since Bill Monroe. The amplified instrument has infrequently been used in modern rock music groups. The bowl-back mandocello (mandoloncello) is traditionally used for Italian folk music. The most historically significant mandocellist was Raffaele Calace, who wrote the first method book specifically for liuto cantabile, and is thought to have perfected the design of the instrument following its putative introduction by the Vinaccia family. Luigi Embergher also contributed significantly to advancements in the design of the instrument during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Embergher.com Image in contemporary music Accomplished artists specializing in mandocello performance in 21st century America are relatively few in number, and only a modest number of contemporary recordings prominently feature the instrument. One American mandocello artist, Stanley Greenthal, is a specialist in the music of Brittany and an instructor at Zouk Fest. The mandolinist Radim ZenklRadim Zenkl is also well known for performances of American, Italian, and other European folk music on the mandocello. One recent recording with mandolin virtuosos Carlo AonzoCarlo Aonzo and David Grisman has featured Zenkl's mandocello on the album of Italian folk music \\"Traversata\\" published by Acoustic Disc.Acoustic Disc Steve Knightley of the English folk-rock band Show of Hands plays the cello-mandolin, however his instrument is tuned GDAD, similar to an octave mandolin. Mike Marshall, best known for his collaborations with David Grisman, Darol Anger and Chris Thile has performed and recorded frequently with the mandocello. Notable uses Steve Knightley, the English folk musician and songwriter, made the mandocello a key part of his songwriting and overall sound, especially with his band Show of Hands https://www.showofhands.co.uk/steve-knightley-story. Steve uses instruments made by David and Nicholas Oddie in Devon, England http://www.oddyluthiers.co.uk/mandocello.htm, in the tuning GDAD which makes the instrument more effective for chunky chord accompaniments as well as playing tunes. Steve also plays guitar, cuatro mandolin, and tenor guitar. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4nDXTl7mME Geoff Goodman, New York born European jazz musician and composer, features both guitar and mandocello in his compositions. Patterson Hood, front man for Drive-By Truckers, plays a mandocello made by Scott Baxendale of Baxendale Guitars in Athens Georgia. Baxendale starts with a vintage Harmony guitar and converts it from six string standard tuning to the mandocello. Bryn Haworth uses a mandocello on his album Let The Days Go By. John Nagy and David Grisman play mandocello on the Earth Opera album The Great American Eagle Tragedy. Mike Marshall played a mandocello on his collaboration album Uncommon Ritual with Edgar Meyer and B√©la Fleck and plays it live occasionally (for example with Darol Anger on violin). Rick Nielsen of the band Cheap Trick has a stringed instrument collection that includes electric mandocellos custom made by Hamer Guitars. Such an instrument was used for the title track from their LP Heaven Tonight, while their song \\"Mandocello\\", released on the band's debut album, used a standard acoustic mandocello. This song was later covered by Concrete Blonde and released on their album Still in Hollywood. Jaco Pastorius, bassist for Weather Report, overdubbed a mandocello on their hit \\"Birdland.\\" Richie Sambora, guitarist for Bon Jovi, used a mandocello on the song \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\" from their acoustic album This Left Feels Right.

He was educated at Berlin and Jena universities. During 1867 and 1868 he was the holder of a fellowship at the Royal Statistical Bureau of Berlin, and in 1869 became privat-docent at the University of Heidelberg, but in the same year accepted an invitation from the Polytechnikum at Riga. Cohn paid a visit to England in 1873, and the fruits of his observation and research were embodied in the masterly production \\"Untersuchungen √ºber die Englische Eisenbahnpolitik,\\" 2 vols., Leipzig, 1874-75. In 1875, he was invited to fill the chair of economics at ETH Zurich, which he held until 1884, when he became professor in the University of G√∂ttingen. While at Zurich he prepared for publication his \\"Volkswirtschaftliche Aufs√§tze\\" (Stuttgart, 1882), and contributed to the \\"G√∂ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen\\" (1880, i. 97-135) an exhaustive critical review of the first volume of Wagner's \\"Allgemeine Volkswirtschaftlehre.\\" The names of Wagner and Cohn have often been coupled, not only because both were classed among the Katheder-Socialisten, but also because they have much in common in their attitude toward the various so-called schools of economic science. In continuation of his study of the English railroad policy, and as the third volume of his earlier work on that subject, appeared his \\"Die Englische Eisenbahnpolitik der Letzten Zehn Jahre,\\" Leipzig, 1883. After his establishment at G√∂ttingen a period of ardent literary activity set in. The first volume of the greatest work which he has yet produced, his \\"System der National√∂konomie,\\" was published in 1885, the very next year after his arrival. It is significant of the importance and character of this work that two such great leaders of the respective opposing \\"schools\\" as Wagner and Schmoller should unite in praising it. In 1886, he contributed to the \\"Jahrbuch f√ºr National√∂konomie\\"(vol. xiii, No. 6), \\"Zur Fabrikgesetzgebung,\\" a review of government reports on factory legislation in Switzerland and Saxony, and to the \\"Jahrbuch f√ºr Gesetzgebung\\" (x.3), \\"Er√∂terungen √ºber die Fiskalische Behandlung der Verkehrsanstalten.\\" In that year, too, appeared his \\"National√∂konomische Studien,\\" Stuttgart, 1886. The year 1889 witnessed the publication of the second volume of his \\"System der National√∂konomie,\\" and his \\"Finanzwissenschaft.\\" Cohn was elected a regular member of the Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften at G√∂ttingen in 1894; and in 1896 the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle of the fourth class was conferred upon him. After an interval of nearly ten years he completed the third volume of the \\"System der National√∂konomie,\\" which was also issued under the title \\"National√∂konomie des Handelsund Verkehrswesens: Ein Lesebuch f√ºr Studierende,\\" Stuttgart, 1898. To the \\"Jahrbuch f√ºr National√∂konomie\\" (vi, Jan., 1901) he contributed \\"Ueber die Vereinigung der Staatswissenschaften mit den Juristenfacult√§ten.\\"  Works  * \\"Untersuchungen √ºber die Englische Eisenbahnpolitik\\". 2 vols in 1 (Leipzig, 1874 and 1875) * \\"Volkswirtschaftliche Aufs√§tze\\" (Stuttgart, 1882) * \\"Die englische Eisenbahnpolitik der letzten zehn Jahre (1873-1883)\\" (Leipzig, 1883) * \\"System der National√∂konomie\\" (Stuttgart, 1885-1898, 3 vols.)  \\"Vol. 1 - Grundlegung der National√∂konomie (Stuttgart, 1885);  \\"Vol. 2 - System der Finanzwissenschaft\\" (Stuttgart, 1889); Vol. 2, transl. by Thorstein Veblen, , (Chicago, 1895)  \\"Vol. 3 - National√∂konomie des Handels und des Verkehrswesens (Stuttgart, 1898) * \\"National√∂konomische Studien\\" (1886) * \\"Die deutsche Frauenbewegung.

Student profile  JCIB students are diverse: 56% are white, 32% are African-American, 6% are Asian-American, 4% are Hispanic, and 2% are multiracial. Twenty percent of students qualified for free or reduced price lunch. 100% of JCIB students graduate and go on to attend four-year colleges and universities. The 2016 graduating class earned approximately $12 million in college scholarships, an average of almost $160,000 per student. JCIB students have an average ACT score of 29, and the average SAT score is 1,831. The most recent graduating class includes three National Merit & Achievement Finalists, 64 AP Scholars, 35 AP Scholars with Honor, 21 AP Scholars with Distinction, and two AP National Scholars.  Admission  Students must apply to JCIB during the spring prior to the year of anticipated enrollment. The application requires students to submit a transcript and test scores from their current schools, recommendations from both a mathematics and language arts instructor, and an application essay. Students are also strongly encouraged to attend an open house and/or shadow a student prior to applying. Students must also pay tuition if they live outside the school district. Students from other counties and even students from the same county that live in an area that falls within another school district must pay over $2200 at registration in tuition alone or they cannot attend even if they have been accepted.  Curriculum  = AP & IB Courses = All academic courses at JCIB are taught at an accelerated pace. Many courses prepare students for Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate Exams. Students choose from among the following AP and IB courses: {- valign =\\"top\\"  * Biology (AP and IB) * Calculus (AP and IB) * Chemistry (AP and IB) * Computer Science (AP) * English Language & Composition (AP) * English Literature & Composition (AP) * Environmental Science (AP and IB) * French (AP and IB) * German (AP and IB) * Human Geography (AP and IB) * Macroeconomics (AP) * Microeconomics (AP)  * Modern European History (AP) * Music Theory (AP) * Physics (AP) * Psychology (AP and IB) * Spanish (AP and IB) * Statistics (AP) * Studio Art (AP and IB) * Theater (IB) * Theory of Knowledge (IB) * US Government & Politics (AP) * US History (AP and IB) * World Literature (IB) } While all students are required to take a rigorous curriculum that includes both AP and IB coursework, students may choose whether to work toward earning an IB diploma. Approximately 64% of the 2015 graduating class received an IB diploma. = Creativity, Action, Service (CAS) Work/Study Program = Beginning in 11th grade, JCIB's students participate in a work-study program every Wednesday afternoon. Students choose whether to take on an unpaid internship in a career area of interest, volunteer for a nonprofit organization, or perform some other community service. These hours contribute to the 150 CAS (Creativity, Action, Service) hours that are required in order to receive the IB diploma. All students participate in the CAS program, even if they do not pursue the IB diploma. = IB Extended Essay = Students are required to write a 4,000-word extended essay on a topic of their choosing.

It was established in 1902 by Assid Abraham Corban, a Lebanese immigrant who had arrived in New Zealand ten years earlier. Corbans Wines grew to become the second largest producer of wine in New Zealand until they were purchased by Montana Wines in 2000.> Following several takeovers of Montana by Allied Domecq and then Pernod Ricard, Corbans was spun off in 2011 and is now owned by Lion.  History  Assid Abraham Corban purchased a block of rural land for ¬£320 in Henderson. Although Henderson is now suburban Auckland, at the time the block was in a rural area quite some distance away, which he named Mt Lebanon Vineyards. The original plantings were Black Hamburgh, Chasselas, Hermitage, and Cabernet Sauvignon. The first vintage was in 1908, coinciding with the local electorate voting in prohibition, which meant he was unable to sell wine from the property. Assid's son Wadier took over wine-making in 1916, and by the 1920s the Corban family were the largest winemakers in New Zealand. Development of different vineyards by the five sons of Assid Corban continued until 1963 when the partnership of the five brothers was converted into Corban Wines Ltd. By the 1960s, Corbans produced New Zealand's first commercial M√ºller-Thurgau, Pinotage, and Chardonnay wines, and were pioneering many new developments in winemaking such as using cultured yeast and temperature-control during fermentation, and the use of stainless steel tanks and press machinery. At the same time however, the family struggled to finance increasing competition with Montana Wines. New Zealand food wholesaler Rothman Industries (later Magnum Corporation) took a shareholding, and by 1979 had taken full control. In the 1980s Corbans was also producing wines under the Stoneleigh and Robard and Butler labels. Today, the Corban family are no longer associated with Corbans wines; Alwyn Corban set out in 1981 to establish Ngatarawa Wines in what is now the Bridge Pa Triangle zone of the Hawke's Bay wine region, now owned by Mission Estate. The original estate homestead and winery buildings in Henderson were sold in 1992 to the Waitakere City Council, which repurposed the historic buildings as art studios and galleries, establishing the Corban Estate Arts Centre in 2001.

Bikutsi music is characterized by an up-tempo 6/8 rhythm, danced with energetic pulsations of shoulders and/or pelvis. For more than ten years now, K-Tino (on earlier albums Catino) has been one of the main exponents of bikutsi. Her lyrics are quite explicit, although she herself denies that she is vulgar, saying \\" I am not vulgar, I do not make vulgar spectacles. If I am vulgar, then the Ewondo language is vulgar.\\" A key to bikutsi is the subtlety of the sexual content, which is hidden by changing non-vulgar words very slightly in the Ewondo language.

History In Easthampstead there is evidence of local Bronze Age existence in the form of a large round barrow on the top of Bill Hill. The hill itself is also surrounded by an ancient ditch, which has largely been filled in. Bill Hill now forms part of a park next to Downshire Way and it is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Easthampsted is mentioned as an entry in the Domesday book as land belonging to the abbey of Westminster St. Peter in the hundred of Ripplesmere.http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/SU8667/easthampstead/ Open Domesday: Easthampstead It was a small village of 14 villagers and 8 ploughlands, and had a value of ¬£5 in 1066. By 1070 it was only worth ¬£2.5. Originally Easthampstead was an important parish in Windsor Forest, its manor house at Easthampstead Park being a popular hunting lodge with the Royal Family. Another large and important house in the old parish is South Hill Park, one time home of Prime Minister George Canning. Still older is Caesar's Camp, the only Iron Age hill fort in East Berkshire. Easthampstead once had its own Rural District, but it is no longer even a civil parish. Much of the southern portion of the old parish has been given to adjoining Crowthorne.

She wrote four popular history books, each dealing with a different aspect of the Victorian era. Early life Cecil Woodham-Smith was born in 1896 in Tenby, Wales. Her family, the Fitzgeralds, were a well-known Irish family, one of her ancestors being Lord Edward Fitzgerald, hero of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Her father Colonel James FitzGerald had served in the Indian Army during the Sepoy Mutiny; her mother's family included General Sir Thomas Picton, a distinguished soldier who was killed at Waterloo. She attended the Royal School for Officers' Daughters in Bath, until her expulsion for taking unannounced leave for a trip to the National Gallery. She finished her schooling at a French convent and afterwards entered St Hilda's College, Oxford. She graduated with a second- class degree in English in 1917. In 1928 she married George Ivon Woodham- Smith, a distinguished London solicitor with whom she had an exceptionally close and deep relationship until his death in 1968. But although she possessed a knack for historical writing, she postponed her career (as was customary for women of her time) until her two children had gone off to boarding school. In the meantime, she wrote pot-boilers under the pseudonym Janet Gordon; this training was to stand her in good stead as an historian, as she mastered the art of writing entertaining narrative. Career Her first book as a historian, a biography of Florence Nightingale published in 1950, took her straight to the top of her profession. Her meticulous research had taken nine years, and the book succeeded in restoring Nightingale's reputation, which had dwindled following Lytton Strachey's representation of her in Eminent Victorians. Acclaimed for its combination of scholarship and readability, Florence Nightingale won the James Tait Black Award for biography. Her next book was equally well received. The Reason Why (1953) was a study of the Charge of the Light Brigade, a military disaster during the Crimean War and one of the defining events of the Victorian age. It became her most popular book, and afterwards she explained to a television audience how she wrote the Charge itself: working at a gallop through thirty-six hours non- stop without food or other break until the last gun was fired, when she poured a stiff drink and slept for two days. Though the work was critically acclaimed, it came to the conclusion that the allies had lost the Crimean War, which most historians conclude is not true. She produced two more notable works. The first was The Great Hunger: Ireland: 1845-1849 (1962), a history of the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s that was critical of the British government's handling of the famine, in particular singling out Sir Charles Edward Trevelyan for criticism, although she did acknowledge that the British government assisted during the first phase of the famine. The second was the first volume of Queen Victoria: Her Life and Times (1972). She was unable to complete the next volume of the biography, and died in London in 1977 at the age of 80. Cecil Woodham-Smith was appointed CBE in 1960. She received honorary doctorates from the National University of Ireland in 1964 and the University of St Andrews in 1965. She also became an honorary fellow of St Hilda's College (her alma mater) in 1967. Alan Bennett wrote of her: > Cecil was a frail woman with a tiny bird-like skull, looking more like > Elizabeth I (in later life) than Edith Sitwell ever did (and minus her sheet > metal earrings).

View of the Grand Lake Theatre in Oakland, California History The Grand Lake Theater, designed as a single auditorium theater by Architects Reid Brothers for local businessmen Abraham C. Karski and Louis Kaliski, held its grand opening on March 6, 1926. On August 1, 1929, Abraham C. Karski and Louis Kaliski leased the theater to West Coast Theatres, Inc. for a period of 94 years, 4 months until November 30, 2023.Lease (Indenture) Agreement dated August 1, 1929 by and between Louis Kaliski and A.C. Karski (Lessors) and West Coast Theatres, Inc. (Lessee) The descendants of Abraham C. Karski and Louis Kaliski owned the Theatre for nearly nine decades, operating it under the original lease terms although assigning it twice (to Mann Theaters Corporation of California (who later became National General Theaters, Inc.) in 1973 and to the current tenant Renaissance Rialto, Inc. in 1980.) After the Grand Lake Theater opened on March 6, 1926, it held vaudeville and silent movie showings, but with the arrival of \\"talkies\\" it began to exclusively show sound films. The original Wurlitzer Hope Jones Unified Orchestral Organ by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Co. of San Francisco still stands in the main auditorium. The original phone number for the theater was Glencourt 3100 and the original ticket prices were 40 cents for night and Sunday matinees in the orchestra and balcony, 50 cents for the loges, 25 cents for daily matinees, and 10 cents for children at any performance.Souvenir Program from the Premier Opening of the Grand Lake Theater on March 6, 1926 The theater's exterior is surmounted by a giant illuminated rooftop sign which was originally furnished by Brumfield Electric Sign Co., Inc. Neoclassical faux columns and urns line the main interior space and the ceiling is adorned with a crystal chandelier in the lobby and classical frescos in the auditorium. The theater's interior artwork is considered to be Art Deco. After purchasing the lease in 1980, Renaissance Rialto, Inc., owned by Allen Michaan, spent $3.5 million on renovation and expansion. In 1981, the balcony of the auditorium was split into a second auditorium. In 1985, neighboring storefronts were purchased and attached to the theater. These were transformed into a small Egyptian Revival styled auditorium and a small Moorish styled auditorium. After the expansions of the 1980s, the Grand Lake Theatre had a total of four screens and 1619 seats. The main auditorium is also equipped with a Mighty Wurlitzer organ hidden beneath the floor. On Friday and Saturday evenings, the historical organ rises for a brief concert before the movie. Most recently, Allen Michaan has spent close to $300,000 to install twin 3-D projectors in two of the 84-year-old Oakland movie palace's theaters - similar to the state-of-the-art setup Pixar has in its private screening auditorium, and he also repainted the building at a cost of $170,000. The Theater's 95-year lease was set to expire on November 30, 2023; prior to this, however, longtime tenant Allen Michaan purchased the Grand Lake Theatre in August 2018. Since March 16, 2020, the Theatre has been temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Roof Sign The sign mounted on top of the Grand Lake Theatre is the largest rotary contact sign west of the Mississippi River. It measures 52 feet (15.85m) high by 72 feet (21.95m) wide and consists of 2,800 colored bulbs and was designed by Theodore Wetteland. The firing sequence is controlled by a device much like a music box. The sign is typically lit Friday and Saturday, from dusk until the start of the last show of the night. Politics Current owner Michaan is known to use his liberal politics as a guide in managing the Grand Lake. In 2004, he publicly announced that the theater would not enforce the R rating of the political documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. The Grand Lake has also received widespread recognition for Michaan's use of the marquee as a political message board. In outrage at the 2000 presidential election, he posted this message on the high-traffic side of the marquee: \\"This Is America ‚Äî Every Vote Should Be Counted\\" Since then, and with much support from the local community, Michaan has regularly used one side of the theater's marquee to display a timely political message. In addition to films, the theater also occasionally hosts talks and events on progressive political issues. In November 2005, the Theatre served as a center for relief efforts for victims of Hurricane Katrina that Congresswoman Barbara Lee coordinated. Between the midterm elections of November 2006 and January 2007, no political messages were displayed on the marquee, instead devoting the space to the names of upcoming films. Messages began to appear again in early January, beginning with \\"All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing,\\" a statement derived from Edmund Burke's 1770 speech to Parliament, \\"Thoughts on the Cause of Present Discontents.\\" On September 9 and 10, 2009, the fifth 9/11 Film Festival was presented at the Grand Lake Theatre. The theater premiered Dylan Avery's Loose Change 9/11: An American Coup, narrated by Daniel Sunjata and produced by Korey Rowe and Matthew Brown. On November 2, 2011, the Grand Lake Theatre closed its doors in support of the Occupy Oakland general strike. The marquee read \\"We proudly support the Occupy Wall Street Movement. Closed Wed. to support the strike.\\" The Rachel Maddow Show featured the theater on November 2, 2011, as part of the video segment covering that day's Occupy Oakland protest and general strike. Maddow, a native of nearby Castro Valley, said that the Grand Lake Theatre was one of her favorite landmarks when she was growing up and is still a favorite of hers as an adult today. See the Rachel Maddow Show Nov 2nd transcript for her full statement about the Grand Lake Theatre. More recently, hundreds also gathered outside the Theatre in December 2019 in support of the Impeachment of Donald Trump, which the Theatre's marquee staunchly supported.

After releasing two albums worldwide, Rise from the Ashes (1998) and Eternal Crusade (2000), the band had changed their singer and formed Highland Glory. With a fresh new start and an increased potential, the band developed their style of melodic metal in a heavier and more traditional direction on the debut album, From the Cradle to the Brave (2003). The artwork was created by Mark Wilkinson (famous for his work with Marillion, Fish, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, etc.), who has worked for the band ever since.

This reaction was discovered in 1988 by Tamejiro Hiyama and Yasuo Hatanaka as a method to form carbon-carbon bonds synthetically with chemo- and regioselectivity. The Hiyama coupling has been applied to the synthesis of various natural products. :\\\\begin{matrix}{}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{{R-SiR_3} + R'-X ->[\\\\mathrm{F^-}][\\\\text{Pd cat.}] R-R'} \\\\end{matrix} :* R: aryl, alkenyl or alkynyl :* R': aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl or alkyl :* R: Cl, F or alkyl :* X: Cl, Br, I or OTf Reaction history The Hiyama coupling was developed to combat the issues associated with other organometallic reagents. The initial reactivity of organosilicon was not actually first reported by Hiyama, as Kumada reported a coupling reaction using organofluorosilicates shown below. Organosilanes were then discovered, by Hiyama, to have reactivity when activated by a fluoride source. This reactivity, when combined with a palladium salt, creates a carbon-carbon bond with an electrophillic carbon, like an organic halide. Compared to the inherent issues of well-used organometalics reagents, such as organomagnesium (Grignard Reagents) and organocopper reagents, which are very reactive and are known to have low chemoselectivity, enough to destroy functional groups on both coupling partners, organosilicon compounds are inactive. Other organometallic reagents using metals such as zinc, tin, and boron, reduce the reactivity issue, but have other problems associated with each reagent. Organozinc reagents are moisture sensitive, organotin compounds are toxic, and organoboron reagents are not readily available, are expensive, and aren't often stable. Organosilanes are readily available compounds that, upon activation (much like organotin or organoboron compounds) from fluoride or a base, can react with organohalides to form C-C bonds in a chemo- and regioselective manner. The reaction first reported was used to couple easily made (and activated) organosilicon nucleophiles and organohalides (electrophiles) in the presence of a palladium catalyst. Since this discovery, work has been done by various groups to expand the scope of this reaction and to \\"fix\\" the issues with this first coupling, such as the need for fluoride activation of the organosilane. Silicate coupling precedent for development of the Hiyama coupling Mechanism The organosilane is activated with fluoride (as some sort of salt such as TBAF or TASF) or a base to form a pentavalent silicon center which is labile enough to allow for the breaking of a C-Si bond during the transmetalation step. The general scheme to form this key intermediate is shown below. This step occurs in-situ or at the same time as the catalytic cycle in the reaction. center The mechanism for the Hiyama coupling follows a catalytic cycle, including an A) oxidative addition step, in which the organic halide adds to the palladium oxidizing the metal from palladium(0) to palladium(II); a B) transmetalation step, in which the C-Si bond is broken and the second carbon fragment is bound to the palladium center; and finally C) a reductive elimination step, in which the C-C bond is formed and the palladium returns to its zero-valent state to start the cycle over again. The catalytic cycle is shown below. The Catalytic Cycle of the Hiyama coupling Scope and limitations =Scope= The Hiyama coupling can be applied to the formation of Csp2-Csp2 (e.g. aryl‚Äìaryl) bonds as well as Csp2-Csp3 (e.g. aryl‚Äìalkyl) bonds. Good synthetic yields are obtained with couplings of aryl halides, vinyl halides, and allylic halides and organo iodides afford the best yields. The scope of this reaction was expanded to include closure of medium-sized rings by Scott E. Denmark. alt=Hiyama coupling as a ring-closing reaction. Note, that there will be an 8 Carbonatom ring instead the shown 10-Carbon ring. (See the Paper) The coupling of alkyl halides with organo-halo-silanes as alternative organosilanes has also been performed. Organochlorosilanes allow couplings with aryl chlorides, which are abundant and generally more economical than aryl iodides. A nickel catalyst allows for access to new reactivity of organotrifluorosilanes as reported by GC Fu et al. Secondary alkyl halides are coupled with aryl silanes with good yields using this reaction. The Nickel-catalyzed Hiyama coupling as discovered by GC Fu et al. =Limitations= The Hiyama coupling is limited by the need for fluoride in order to activate the organosilicon reagent. Addition of fluoride cleaves any silicon protecting groups (e.g. silyl ethersGreene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed.; John Wiley & Sons: New York, 1991. ), which are frequently employed in organic synthesis. The fluoride ion is also basic, so base sensitive protecting groups, acidic protons, and functional groups may be affected by the addition of this activator. Most of the active research concerning this reaction involves circumventing this problem. To overcome this issue, many groups have looked to the use of other basic additives for activation, or use of a different organosilane reagent all together, leading to the multiple variations of the original Hiyama coupling. Variations One modification of the Hiyama coupling utilizes a silacyclobutane ring and a fluoride source that is hydrated as shown below. This mimics the use of an alkoxysilane/organosilanol rather than the use of alkylsilane. The mechanism of this reaction, using a fluoride source, allowed for the design of future reactions that can avoid the use of the fluoride source. Proposed transition state of Denmark's Hiyama coupling of silacyclobutanes =Fluoride-free Hiyama couplings= Many modifications to the Hiyama coupling have been developed that avoid the use of a fluoride activator/base. Using organochlorosilanes, Hiyama found a coupling scheme utilizing NaOH as the basic activator. Modifications using alkoxysilanes have been reported with the use of milder bases like NaOH and even water. Study of these mechanisms have led to the development of the Hiyama‚ÄìDenmark coupling which utilize organosilanols as coupling partners. NaOH-promoted Hiyama coupling Another class of fluoride-free Hiyama couplings include the use of a Lewis acid additive, which allows for bases such as K3PO4 to be utilized, or for the reaction to proceed without a basic additive. The addition of a copper co- catalyst has also been reported to allow for the use of a milder activating agent and has even been shown to get turnover in which both the palladium(II) and copper(I) turnover in the catalytic cycle rather than addition of stoichiometric Lewis acid (e.g. silver(I), copper(I)). Hiyama coupling with a copper co-catalyst =Hiyama‚ÄìDenmark coupling= The Hiyama‚ÄìDenmark coupling is the modification of the Hiyama coupling that does not require a fluoride additive to utilize organosilanols and organic halides as coupling partners. The general reaction scheme is shown below, showcasing the utilization of a Br√∏nsted base as the activating agent as opposed to fluoride, phosphine ligands are also used on the metal center. General scheme of the Hiyama‚ÄìDenmark coupling A specific example of this reaction is shown with reagents. If fluoride had been used, as in the original Hiyama protocol, the tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether would have likely been destroyed. Example of silanol coupling without fluoride additives Hiyama‚ÄìDenmark coupling mechanism Examination of this reaction's mechanism suggests that the formation of the silonate is all that is needed to activate addition of the organosilane to the palladium center. The presence of a pentavalent silicon is not needed and kinetic analysis has shown that this reaction has first order dependence on silonate concentration. This is due to the key bond being formed, the Pd-O bond during the transmetalation step, that then allows for transfer of the carbon fragment onto the palladium center. Based on this observation, it seems that the rate limiting step in this catalytic cycle is the Pd-O bond formation, in which increased silonate concentrations increase the rate of this reaction (indicative of faster reactions). center Catalytic cycle of the Hiyama‚ÄìDenmark coupling See also *Heck reaction *Kumada coupling *Negishi coupling *Sonogashira coupling *Stille reaction *Suzuki reaction *Palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions External links * Information about Hiyama couplings * Information about Hiyama‚ÄìDenmark couplings References Category:Organometallic chemistry Category:Carbon- carbon bond forming reactions Category:Palladium Category:Name reactions ","title":"Hiyama coupling"},{"id":"1962913","text":"The Three Musketeers is a 1993 American-Austrian action-adventure comedy film from Walt Disney Pictures, Caravan Pictures, and The Kerner Entertainment Company, directed by Stephen Herek from a screenplay by David Loughery. It stars Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, Tim Curry, and Rebecca De Mornay. The film is loosely based on the 1844 novel The Three Musketeers (Les Trois Mousquetaires) by Alexandre Dumas. It recounts the adventures of d'Artagnan on his quest to join the three title characters in becoming a musketeer. However, this adaptation simplifies and alters the story.  Plot  In 1625, young-but-skilled fencer d'Artagnan sets off for Paris, France in hopes to follow in his murdered father's footsteps and become a member of the musketeers: the personal guard of the King of France. He is pursued by G√©rard and his brothers, accused of blemishing their sister's honor. Unfortunately, Captain Rochefort of the Cardinal's Guards has disbanded the musketeers per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu, the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort informs Richelieu that three musketeers refused to relinquish their duties: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. In Paris, d‚ÄôArtagnan ‚Äúrescues‚Äù the queen‚Äôs handmaidens from their own bodyguards, and after a scolding, takes a liking to one, Constance. In the city d‚ÄôArtagnan has a series of physical encounters with the Three Musketeers, though he doesn't know they are musketeers, resulting in a duel with each. At the Ruins, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as musketeers to d'Artagnan's surprise. Before they can duel, a Captain of the Cardinal's Guard arrives to arrest the musketeers with five other cardinal‚Äôs guards; although d'Artagnan is not under arrest, he allies with the musketeers during the skirmish. The Musketeers kill four guards, while d‚ÄôArtagnan accidentally hurls the Captain of the Guard down a huge cliff. Impressed but displeased at d'Artagnan's involvement, the musketeers leave d'Artagnan behind after encouraging him to flee and maintain his innocence. When more of the Cardinal's Guards arrive, d'Artagnan is captured. d'Artagnan eavesdrops on a conversation between Richelieu and the mysterious Milady de Winter whereupon he tasks her with delivering a signed treaty to England's Duke of Buckingham. d'Artagnan is unable to see her face before being caught by Rochefort; Richelieu orders him executed for refusing to give up the musketeers' location, but he is saved by the musketeers. As they flee, d'Artagnan reveals Richelieu's plans; they decide to find the spy and get the treaty to prove Richelieu's guilt. During a skirmish, the party splits up; d'Artagnan rides ahead to intercept the spy, but passes out from exhaustion. He wakes in a bed stripped of his weapons and clothes as Milady de Winter tries to seduce him. d'Artagnan speaks freely of his plans, not knowing she is the spy, and she seduces him to kiss her. She tries to kill him, but he convinces her to keep him alive. As her party tries to escape by boat to England, they are confronted by the musketeers. Milady attempts to run away but is stopped by Athos, who calls her Sabine; they had been lovers, but he regretfully betrayed her to the authorities when he found out she was branded for execution. The musketeers retrieve the treaty and Sabine is sentenced to beheading for killing her first husband, Lord de Winter; just before she is executed, Athos begs her forgiveness. Moved, she reveals the Cardinal's plans to assassinate the king at his birthday celebration before throwing herself off a cliff to her death. Athos, Porthos and Aramis send missives to rally the rest of the musketeers. Richelieu and Rochefort hired a sharpshooter; during the assembly, d'Artagnan makes the sniper's shot go wide, narrowly missing the king. Richelieu deflects blame to the three musketeers in the crowd for the attempted assassination. As the three face off with the Cardinal's guards, men rush to their sides and reveal themselves as musketeers. The two forces battle as Richelieu takes the king and queen hostage, shooting Aramis in the chest before fleeing to the dungeon with Athos and Porthos in pursuit. d'Artagnan duels Rochefort and is disarmed; as Rochefort gloats about having killed d'Artagnan's father, Constance passes his sword back and d'Artagnan promptly kills Rochefort. Athos and Porthos arrive just as Richelieu's boat leaves on an underground river. Although his plans are foiled, Richelieu claims he will be back. The boatman then reveals himself as Aramis, his crucifix having stopped the bullet. Aramis attempts to apprehend the Cardinal, but King Louis stops him to punch Richelieu himself, knocking him into the river. The musketeers are reinstated by the king, and d'Artagnan is offered anything he wants; he chooses to serve Louis as a musketeer. Outside the musketeer headquarters, G√©rard and his brothers arrive and challenge d'Artagnan to a duel; Porthos reminds him that musketeers not only protect King and country, but also each other. G√©rard and his brothers are then chased off by the entire musketeer division.  Cast  *Charlie Sheen as Aramis *Kiefer Sutherland as Athos *Chris O'Donnell as D'Artagnan *Oliver Platt as Porthos *Tim Curry as Cardinal Richelieu *Rebecca De Mornay as Milady de Winter *Gabrielle Anwar as Queen Anne *Michael Wincott as Captain Rochefort *Paul McGann as Girard and Jussac *Julie Delpy as Constance *Hugh O'Conor as King Louis *Christopher Adamson as Henri *Herbert Fux as an Innkeeper *Bob Anderson (Uncredited) as The King's Fencing Instructor  Production  Charlie Sheen was originally sought for the role of Porthos before he was cast as Aramis. Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell and Oliver Platt all endured six weeks of fencing and riding lessons. Sheen missed this training as he was still filming Hot Shots! Part Deux. Brad Pitt and Stephen Dorff turned down the role of d'Artagnan, which ultimately went to O'Donnell. William Baldwin, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Cary Elwes and Gary Oldman were also sought out by Disney for parts in the film. Winona Ryder was considered for the role of Milady de Winter, but dropped out and Rebecca De Mornay was cast. The Three Musketeers was mostly shot in Perchtoldsdorf, Austria, where De Mornay attended high school and college. A rival TriStar version was also in development at the same time as this film, with Depp and director Jeremiah S. Chechik attached. Ultimately, it fell through. Oliver Platt had also been approached to play Porthos in that version as well. = Filming locations = Filming locations included Charlestown, Cornwall, UK, and Castle Landsee (Burgenland); Burg Liechtenstein, Maria Enzersdorf, Hinterbr√ºhl, Korneuburg (Lower Austria); and Vienna (particularly Hofburg) in Austria. Some sequences were shot in Cornwall, UK. A small woods called Golitha Falls was used in one sequence when the musketeers are being pursued by guards. The small harbor village of Charlestown is home to the galleon that was used in a night-shoot.  Reception  On Rotten Tomatoes the film finds an approval rating of 28% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 4.78/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Its starry trio of do-gooders may promise to fight 'one for all, all for one,' but this Three Musketeers is a slickly unmemorable update bound to satisfy very few.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Film critic Leonard Maltin christened this version Young Swords, as it reunited Sheen and Sutherland, both of Young Guns fame. Janet Maslin of The New York Times described the movie as \\"Conceived frankly as a product, complete with hit-to-be theme song over the closing credits, this adventure film cares less about storytelling than about keeping the Musketeers' feathered hats on straight whenever they go galloping.\\" Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote that \\"The new Walt Disney version of The Three Musketeers-plushly mounted, but ineptly written and cast-gallops along like a gargantuan tutti-frutti wagon running amok.\\" Chris O'Donnell was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Supporting Actor for his work in the film, but lost to Woody Harrelson for Indecent Proposal. = Box office = The film grossed $11.5 million for the Friday to Sunday weekend, placing it at number 1 at the box office.  Soundtrack  Bryan Adams co-wrote \\"All for Love\\" with Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange and Michael Kamen for the movie's end credits, performing it with Rod Stewart and Sting. As Janet Maslin predicted, the song was a big hit (reaching #1 in North America and several other territories). Kamen also composed the movie's score, conducting the Greater Los Angeles All Star Orchestra. The soundtrack album was released on compact disc and cassette on November 12, 1993 by Hollywood Records in North America and A&M; Records (the label to which both Adams and Sting were signed at the time) elsewhere. # All For Love ‚Äì Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart & Sting (4:45) # The Cavern Of Cardinal Richelieu (Overture & Passacaille) (2:58) # D'Artagnan (Galliard & Air) (3:19) # Athos, Porthos And Aramis (Courante) (5:24) # Sword Fight (Bransle) (3:20) # King Louis XIII, Queen Anne And Constance/Lady In Waiting (Gavotte) (5:05) # The Cardinal's Coach (Estampie) (4:45) # Cannonballs (Rigadoon) (3:29) # M'Lady DeWinter (Lament) (4:16) # The Fourth Musketeer (Concert Royaux) (5:19)  Comic book adaptation  * Marvel Comics: Disney's The Three Musketeers (January 1994)  References   External links    *Roger Ebert review Category:1993 films Category:1990s action films Category:1990s adventure films Category:American children's adventure films Category:American children's comedy films Category:American adventure comedy films Category:American action adventure films Category:American action comedy films Category:American films Category:Austrian films Category:Films directed by Stephen Herek Category:Films scored by Michael Kamen Category:Films produced by Roger Birnbaum Category:Films based on The Three Musketeers Category:Walt Disney Pictures films Category:Caravan Pictures films Category:Films shot in Vienna Category:Films shot in England Category:Swashbuckler films Category:Films set in the 1620s Category:Films set in France Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films with screenplays by David Loughery Category:Films adapted into comics Category:Secret histories Category:Cultural depictions of Louis XIII Category:Cultural depictions of Cardinal Richelieu ","title":"The Three Musketeers (1993 film)"},{"id":"1962914","text":"The acronym IICD is used by at least four organisations: * The Indian Institute of Crafts and Design, an arts academy located in Jaipur, India * The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, a group set up to oversee the decommission of weapons from conflict in Northern Ireland * The International Institute for Communication and Development, a development aid agency established by the government of The Netherlands * The Institute for International Cooperation and Development, a private nonprofit organization based in Massachusetts and Michigan, USA ","title":"IICD"},{"id":"1962916","text":"Sirandou.net cybercafe IICD Kita, Mali The International Institute for Communication and Development (IICD) was a non-profit foundation established by the Ministry for Development Cooperation of the Netherlands in 1996.

There are several different theories for its origin but one of the more popular theories is that it was created by parallel faulting. The mountain around the gorge itself and the stones spread across its bottom consist largely of grey-brown and dark-brown porphyritic rock with elements of quartz and red feldspar. Several species of moss grow in and around the gorge, including Junger-mannia orcandesis and Steodon inponens. In the middle of the gorge is a loose rock that can be removed to reveal a guestbook signed by other visitors (the exact location is marked by a small sign). In the summer, the temperature at the bottom of the gorge is typically somewhat lower than the area around the gorge, and in certain extreme years, pockets of snow and ice have remained until well into the summer. Early in the season, and after heavy rainfall, parts of the gorge may fill with water. The area has been declared a naturreservat (forest and wildlife reserve) by the County Forestry Board and it is forbidden to damage the vegetation, to camp and light fires, to drive motor vehicles or to leave litter. Hiking is allowed (and encouraged) with a 2000-metre-long hiking trail through both the gorge and to the hill of Skuruhatt. There is a legend that trolls live here.

At different times, it could be declared by the Holy Roman Emperor, by the Imperial Diet, or by courts like the League of the Holy Court (Vehmgericht) or the Reichskammergericht. People under imperial ban, known as Ge√§chtete (from about the 17th century, colloquially also as Vogelfreie, lit. \\"free as a bird\\"), lost all their rights and possessions. They were legally considered dead, and anyone was allowed to rob, injure or kill them without legal consequences. The imperial ban automatically followed the excommunication of a person, as well as extending to anyone offering help to a person under the imperial ban. Those banned could reverse the ban by submitting to the legal authority. The Aberacht, a stronger version of the imperial ban, could not be reversed. The imperial ban was sometimes imposed on whole Imperial Estates. In that case, other estates could attack and seek to conquer them. The effect of the ban on a city or other Estate was that it lost its Imperial immediacy and in the future would have a second overlord in addition to the emperor. Famous people placed under the imperial ban included: * 1180 Henry the Lion, for refusing military support to Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor against the cities of the Lombard League. * 1225 Count Frederick of Isenberg, for killing his uncle Engelbert II of Berg, Archbishop of Cologne. * 1235 King Henry (VII) of Germany, for his rebellion against his father the Emperor Frederick II. * 1276 King Ottokar II of Bohemia, for his capture of imperial lands from Rudolph I. * 1309 John Parricida, for the murder of his uncle King Albert I of Germany. * 1415 Frederick IV, Duke of Austria for aiding the flight of Antipope John XXIII from the Council of Constance. * 1512 and 1518 G√∂tz von Berlichingen, the first time for robbery, the second for kidnapping. * 1521 Martin Luther and his supporters, for claiming that some doctrines practiced by the catholic church were contrary to the Bible or had no biblical basis. * 1546 John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, for leading the Schmalkaldic League. * 1566 Wilhelm von Grumbach, for insurgency. * 1621 Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and his supporters Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg and Georg Friedrich of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Weikersheim, for seizing power in Bohemia. * 1706 Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, and Joseph Clemens, Elector of Cologne, for supporting France in the War of the Spanish Succession (ban reversed in 1714) * 1793 Georg Forster, for collaboration with the French Republic. The imperial ban imposed by the Emperor Rudolf II on the city of Donauw√∂rth after an anti-Catholic riot was one of the incidents leading to the Thirty Years' War.

It was founded by Dr. Joseph Kennedy and C. Payne Lucas in 1970, former Peace Corps members who worked in eastern Niger. Africare is the largest and oldest African-American founded international NGO focused exclusively on the continent of Africa. Since 1970, Africare has been improving lives and building a better future by partnering with local communities, focusing on agriculture and food security, healthcare, maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, access to potable water, and women's empowerment. In more than 40 years of building partnerships with local communities, NGOs, governments and the private sector, Africare has invested over $1 billion in more than 35 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Organization The organization employs men and women who are largely indigenous to the countries or to the areas where it works. More than 98% of the staff is of African descent and about 30 staff and volunteers work at the organization's headquarters in the Washington, D.C. Africare's programs address needs mostly in the areas of food security and agriculture, health and HIV/AIDS, water and sanitation, and emergency and humanitarian aid. Africare also supports water resource development, environmental resource management, basic education, microenterprise development, governance initiatives, and women's empowerment. =Countries of operation= Africare currently has active programs in Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ghana, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. History In 1970, when Africare was founded, West Africa was in the midst of one of the most severe droughts in its history. Among those providing help‚Äîmedical aid to the Maine-Soroa town Hospital in Diffa, Niger‚Äîwere 17 American volunteers, led by William O. Kirker, M.D., and Barbara Jean A. Kirker, who named their group \\"Africare\\". The Kirkers themselves had been working in Africa to improve African healthcare since 1966, but eventually they needed more support. Diori Hamani, then president of the Republic of Niger, appealed to the United States on the effort's behalf, asking, \\"Why don't black Americans, whose ancestors came from the continent, respond to the needs in Africa?\\" C. Payne Lucas, then the director of the Peace Corps Office of Returned Volunteers in Washington, D.C. served previously in Niger and knew the president from that time. Lucas and others decided to form an organization to answer Hamani's appeal. In 1970, Africare was incorporated in Hawaii, with Kirker as its founder and first president. In 1971, Africare was permanently reincorporated in Washington, D.C. Lucas became the executive director (later, that title changed to \\"president\\"), and Kirker joined the Board. In addition to Kirker and Lucas, other incorporators were Oumarou G. Youssoufou, a Nigerian diplomat, and Joseph C. Kennedy, Ph.D., then in the Peace Corps. It began with a $39,550 budget, a U.S. headquarters in the basement of Lucas's home and one project in Niger. Africare first concentrated on helping to alleviate the effects of severe drought in West Africa. By the mid-1970s, Africare had shifted its emphasis to development programs in the areas of food, water, the environment and health‚Äîexpanding in the late 1980s to include microenterprise development, governance, basic education and, as it became necessary, HIV/AIDS response, as well as emergency humanitarian aid. Africare Leadership The President and CEO of Africare since November, 2015, is Robert L. Mallett. He develops Africare's strategic vision in a new environment for development assistance. He articulates Africare's unique guiding philosophy and value proposition. Mr. Mallett has a diverse background in law, government, public policy, healthcare and international development. Before joining Africare in late 2015, Mr. Mallett served on the Board of Directors for seven years and as President and CEO at Accordia Global Health Foundation which has just merged with Africare. He was a senior corporate executive at two of the world's largest companies. He was Executive Vice President and General Counsel for the Public & Senior Markets Group at United Healthcare and at Pfizer Inc. he served as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Public Affairs and Policy and as President of the Pfizer Foundation. Mr. Mallett has been in private practice at international law firms in the United States, and served in former President Bill Clinton's administration as Acting Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce. He is a graduate of Morehouse College and received a law degree from Harvard University. In mid-June 2002, C. Payne Lucas retired after 31 years as president and Africare hired its third president, Julius E. Coles, a 28-year veteran of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the first director of the Ralph J. Bunche International Affairs Center at Howard University and, most recently, director of the Andrew Young Center for International Affairs at Morehouse College. Dr. Darius Mans assumed the position of President of Africare on January 4, 2010. Prior to joining Africare, Dr. Mans served as Acting Chief Executive Officer of Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). Dr. Mans has over 30 years of development experience with a major focus on African countries. Prior to being tapped as Acting Chief Executive Officer for MCC, Dr. Mans was the organization's Vice President of Implementation where he oversaw the strategic and operational approaches of MCC's entire compact implementation portfolio of over $6.3 billion in 18 countries. Mans also served as MCC's Managing Director for Africa, where he drove an increase in commitments to Africa by $1.6 billion.Africare.org See also * African Well Fund Penelope Campbell, Africare, Black American Philanthropy in Africa.

Normally, beams of light pass through each other unperturbed. Inside an optical material, and if the intensity of the beams is high enough, the beams may affect each other through a variety of non-linear effects. In pure vacuum, some weak scattering of light by light exists as well. Also, above some threshold of this center-of-mass energy of the system of the two photons, matter can be created. Astronomy Photon‚Äìphoton scattering limits the spectrum of observed gammas to a photon energy below 80 TeV, that is, a wavelength of more than ~ . The other photon is one of the many photons of the cosmic microwave background. In the frame of reference where the invariant mass of the two photons is at rest, both photons are gammas with just enough energy to pair-produce an electron‚Äìpositron pair. Experiments Two-photon physics can be studied with high-energy particle accelerators, where the accelerated particles are not the photons themselves but charged particles that will radiate photons. The most significant studies so far were performed at the Large Electron‚ÄìPositron Collider (LEP) at CERN. If the transverse momentum transfer and thus the deflection is large, one or both electrons can be detected; this is called tagging. The other particles that are created in the interaction are tracked by large detectors to reconstruct the physics of the interaction. Frequently, photon-photon interactions will be studied via ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of heavy ions, such as gold or lead. These are collisions in which the colliding nuclei do not touch each other; i.e., the impact parameter b is larger than the sum of the radii of the nuclei. The strong interaction between the quarks composing the nuclei is thus greatly suppressed, making the weaker electromagnetic \\\\gamma\\\\gamma interaction much more visible. In UPCs, because the ions are heavily charged, it is possible to have two independent interactions between a single ion pair, such as production of two electron- positron pairs. UPCs are studied with the STARlight simulation code. Light-by- light scattering can be studied using the strong electromagnetic fields of the hadrons collided at the LHC, it has first been seen in 2016 by the ATLAS collaborationATLAS Collaboration: Light-by-light scattering in ultra- peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at ‚àösNN=5.02 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC and was then confirmed by the CMS collaboration. The best previous constraint on the elastic photon‚Äìphoton scattering cross section was set by PVLAS, which reported an upper limit far above the level predicted by the Standard Model. Observation of a cross section larger than that predicted by the Standard Model could signify new physics such as axions, the search of which is the primary goal of PVLAS and several similar experiments. Processes From quantum electrodynamics it can be found that photons cannot couple directly to each other and a fermionic field, since they carry no charge and no 2 fermion + 2 boson vertex exists due to requirements of renormalizability, but they can interact through higher-order processes or couple directly to each other in a vertex with an additional two W bosons: a photon can, within the bounds of the uncertainty principle, fluctuate into a virtual charged fermion‚Äìantifermion pair, to either of which the other photon can couple. This fermion pair can be leptons or quarks. Thus, two-photon physics experiments can be used as ways to study the photon structure, or, somewhat metaphorically, what is \\"inside\\" the photon. The photon fluctuates into a fermion‚Äìantifermion pair. Creation of a fermion‚Äìantifermion pair through the direct two-photon interaction. These drawings are Feynman diagrams. There are three interaction processes: *Direct or pointlike: The photon couples directly to a quark inside the target photon. If a lepton‚Äìantilepton pair is created, this process involves only quantum electrodynamics (QED), but if a quark‚Äìantiquark pair is created, it involves both QED and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The intrinsic quark content of the photon is described by the photon structure function, experimentally analyzed in deep-inelastic electron‚Äìphoton scattering. *Single resolved: The quark pair of the target photon form a vector meson. The probing photon couples to a constituent of this meson. *Double resolved: Both target and probe photon have formed a vector meson. This results in an interaction between two hadrons. For the latter two cases, the scale of the interaction is such as the strong coupling constant is large. This is called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) and has to be modelled in non-perturbative QCD.

He is perhaps best known for his appearances with the Universal Wrestling Federation and the World Class Wrestling Association in the mid-1980s, with World Championship Wrestling between 1988 and 1991 and with Extreme Championship Wrestling between 1998 and 2001. Professional wrestling career =Universal Wrestling Federation (1984‚Äì1987)= Rinehurst debuted in 1984 in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-based Universal Wrestling Federation under the ring name Jack Victory. He went on to wrestle throughout the Southeastern United States. Early in his career, Victory accompanied The Sheepherders to ringside while carrying the New Zealand flag. Victory formed a tag team with John Tatum. Managed by Tatum's girlfriend, Missy Hyatt, Victory and Tatum won the UWF Tag Team Championship in 1986. Victory, Tatum and Hyatt joined \\"Hot Stuff International\\", a stable headed by \\"Hot Stuff\\" Eddie Gilbert. =World Class Championship Wrestling (1985‚Äì1988)= In 1985, Victory began appearing with the Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling promotion. He won the WCCW Television Championship from David Peterson in December 1985, losing the title to Mark Youngblood less than a month later. Victory and Tatum won the WCWA Texas Tag Team Championship on three occasions in 1988, trading the titles with Shaun and Steve Simpson. On the 30th of November 1987, Victory and Tatum also teamed together in the Fort Worth, Texas-based Wild West Wrestling (where they won the WWW Tag Team Championship in 1987). Victory and John Tatum defeated Missing Link and Jeff Raitz in a tournament final to become the first champions of the Wild west tag team championships. These titles would unify with the WCCW tag team championships on the 12th of October 1988. =Jim Crockett Promotions (1988‚Äì1991)= In the late 1980s, Victory began wrestling for Jim Crockett Promotions as Jacko Victory, where he formed a tag team with Rip Morgan known as The New Zealand Militia. At the 1989 NWA pay-per-view Chi- Town Rumble, Victory replaced Dennis Condrey as Randy Rose and Paul E. Dangerously's tag team partner. The three men were defeated by the Midnight Express and Jim Cornette in a losing team leaves the NWA match. Victory wrestled at four Clash of the Champions events in 1989, appearing as the masked heel jobbers Russian Assassin #2, The Blackmailer, The Terrorist and The Super Destroyer. In the same year, Victory and Morgan were repackaged as The Royal Family and given a manager, Lord Littlebrook. They wrestled for Jim Crockett Promotions, by then renamed World Championship Wrestling, until their contracts expired and they were released in the early 1990s. In 1990, Victory briefly wrestled for WCW as Jacko Victory. In 1991 Victory and Morgan made their way to the Global Wrestling Federation in Dallas Texas this time as The Maulers. Wrestling as the Maulers, Victory and Morgan also wrestled a dark match at a WWF Superstars taping in Mobile, Alabama on March 9, 1992, defeating Jim Cooper and John Allen.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm =Independent circuit (1991‚Äì1998)= From 1991 to 1998, Victory wrestled on the independent circuit. =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1998‚Äì2001)= In 1998, Victory debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling as a mercenary hired to assault New Jack. His wrestling ended for ECW when he broke his leg at 1998's November to Remember in a tag team match pitting himself and Justin Credible against Tommy Dreamer and Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts when he was backdropped over the top rope by Dreamer. While using a wheelchair for rehabilitation, Victory became the manager of Steve Corino. When his leg healed, Victory began interfering in Corino's matches on behalf of his client. Along with Corino, Victory was a member of the stable known as The Network. He remained in ECW until the promotion declared bankruptcy in April 2001, defeating C.W. Anderson on the promotion's last ever show in January. =Independent circuit (2001‚Äìpresent)= Following the closure of ECW, Victory began wrestling on the independent circuit.

However, St. Ignatius Loyola had always regarded her with suspicion. Falling dangerously ill in 1543, Magdalena confessed that her stigmata and claims of performing miracles were fraudulent.Nickell, Joe. (2001). Real-Life X-Files: Investigating the Paranormal. University of Kentucky Press. p. 281. \\"That many stigmatics were fakes is well established. For example, Magdalena de la Cruz, having become ill in 1543 and fearful of dying a sinner, confessed that her stigmata, inedia, and other phenomena were deliberate deceptions.\\" She was sentenced by the Inquisition, in an auto-da-f√© at C√≥rdoba in 1546, to perpetual imprisonment in a convent of her order, and there she is believed to have ended her days most piously amid marks of the sincerest repentance. During the early decades of the sixteenth century she was considered saintly and believed to be in constant and intimate communication with God. Her devotees included the general of the Franciscan Order, Fray Francisco de los √Ångeles Qui√±ones; Fray Francisco de Osuna, the mystic whose writings were so appreciated by Saint Teresa of √Åvila; and the archbishop of Seville and inquisitor general, Alonso Manrique. Indeed, on the birth of the future Philip II in 1527, \\"the h√°bitos of this nun were sent off as a sacred object so that the infante could be wrapped up in them and thus apparently be shielded and protected from the attacks of the Devil.\\" In 1533 Magdalena was elected abbess of her convent and was at the height of her power and popularity. But only in 1546, and after many false prophecies, visions, and miracles, including a controversial pregnancy, did the Cordoban Inquisition finally try her and sentence her to life imprisonment in a convent in And√∫jar. According to Montague Summers, Magdalena went to the \\"pope (Paul III) as a Penitent, and confessed her sins, that at twelve years old the Devil solicited her, and lay with her, and that he had layen with her for thirty years; yet she was made the Abbess of a Monastery, and counted a saint. [...] She died full of sorrow and deeply contrite, in 1560. It may be remarked that on her confession of imposture and guilt, seventeen years before, the demoniacal stigmata disappeared\\".

He is best known for his tenure with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from 1993 to 1999 under the ring names Scotty Riggs and Riggs. Antol is also known for his appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) as Scotty Anton. Professional wrestling career =Early years (1992‚Äì1995)= Antol debuted on June 2, 1992 using the ring name Scott Studd after being trained by Ted \\"The Nightmare\\" Allen. Allen trained Studd by teaching while wrestling in front of live crowds. In the early 1990s, he worked for various independent promotions, including the North Georgia Wrestling Association (NGWA), Peach State Championship Wrestling (PSCW), Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), and the United States Wrestling Association (USWA). =World Championship Wrestling= American Males (1995-1997) Antol signed a contract with World Championship Wrestling in 1995 and was renamed Scotty Riggs, with his last name taken from Mel Gibson's character, Martin Riggs, from the Lethal Weapon films. He was immediately placed in to a tag team with Marcus Alexander Bagwell and they became known as The American Males. Together, they captured their first and only World Tag Team Championship, but only held it for eight days before losing it back to Harlem Heat, the team they won it from in the first place. The team competed on a tour of Germany for WCW at this time. The American Males broke up in November 1996 after Bagwell turned heel on Riggs and joined the New World Order. Following the split, Riggs began competing as a singles competitor. He immediately entered a feud with Bagwell, which resulted in a match at nWo Souled Out which he lost and a rematch at Uncensored in a strap match where Riggs was choked out by Bagwell with the strap while hanging from the ropes. Raven's Flock and departure (1997-1999) After performing in the mid-card for most of 1997, Raven took an interest in him and during a No Disqualification match on the October 27 edition of Nitro, Raven caught Riggs in a drop toe-hold, sending him face- first into a steel chair and injuring his eye in the process. Riggs then began wearing an eye patch and, to this day, claims that the eye injury was legitimate. At first, Riggs resisted joining Raven's Flock, but eventually joined after they kidnapped him following his loss to Raven at the World War 3 pay-per-view. Raven explained that Riggs's \\"ocular disability\\" had alienated him from society and that he was seeking acceptance within The Flock. Riggs remained within The Flock until Saturn defeated Raven at Fall Brawl: War Games in a match that forced The Flock to disband. Following The Flock's disbanding, Riggs turned heel and adopted a narcissistic gimmick. However, the gimmick was unsuccessful, and Riggs remained on the undercard before being released from WCW in 1999. =Extreme Championship Wrestling (2000‚Äì2001)= In 2000, Antol debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling as Scotty Anton, aligning with his real-life friend Rob Van Dam. At Hardcore Heaven, Anton betrayed Van Dam, knocking him off the top rope to the floor, allowing Jerry Lynn to pin him and thus end Van Dam's two-year undefeated streak. From there, he joined The Network as a \\"hired gun\\". Van Dam gained revenge at Heat Wave, where he defeated Anton by using his new Van Terminator finisher. =Independent circuit and retirement (2001‚Äì2003, 2007‚Äì2009)= After leaving ECW, Antol returned to the independent circuit, where he found his greatest success in Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling (TCW). While competing for TCW, he became a three time Heavyweight Champion and a one time TCW Tag Team Champion with Erik Watts. Following TCW's closure in 2003, Antol took time away from professional wrestling to deal with personal issues of divorce and his father developing lung cancer. His father died from the illness in 2004. Following this, Antol moved to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina to work as a bouncer and manager at a lounge. Upon getting his life together, Antol resumed his wrestling career under his Scotty Riggs ring name, where he wrestled several matches for AWA World-1 Championship Wrestling in 2007 before retiring in 2009 due to injuries. He briefly returned later in 2009 to appear in TNA's Feast or Fired match at Final Resolution, but was unable to retrieve a briefcase and was released from the company two weeks later after he was found to have stolen Rob Terry's case, dedicating the stunt to his former tag team partner, Marcus Bagwell.

It was extended to Brynamman in 1868. Passengers were carried from 1860, and a loop line through Morriston was built. The company was profitable but it was always short of capital, and it looked for a larger company to buy it out. The Midland Railway did so in 1874 when it leased the network, and it absorbed it in 1876. The Midland Railway used the line to get access to Swansea, which it had long sought. After 1923 the Midland's successor transferred the through traffic to another route. Road omnibus services abstracted much of the local passenger business, and only anthracite traffic kept the line going. When that industry declined the railway mineral traffic followed, and from 1965 closures set in. Parts of the network continued for a time, but by 1983 the entire line was closed. Before the railway System map of the Swansea Vale Railway in 1875The South Wales coalfield extends to the sea at Swansea, and therefore was immediately accessible to shipping at a time, before the nineteenth century, when land transport was limited to what pack animals could carry on their backs. At that time the extraction of copper in Cornwall became an important industry, and as a great deal of coal is required to smelt copper, it became the practice to bring the copper to Swansea by ship and smelt it there. This specific sector of the metal industry became so dominant that Swansea was given the nickname Copperopolis. The works engaged in this industry were located on the banks of the River Tawe at first, but the construction of the Swansea Canal, opened in 1798, and the development of railways enabled allied metal industries to operate, and to be located further from water transport terminals.Charles Hadfield, The Canals of South Wales and the Border, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, second edition 1967, Anthracite coal of high quality was available around Llansamlet, and an early wooden wagonway was built from there to a wharf on the River Tawe by George Kirkhouse; it was operational sometime after 1750. John Scott acquired control of mines on the Gwernllwynchwth Estate and after 1812 built a tram road from there to Foxhole, on the Tawe near its mouth.John Miles, Keri Thomas and Tudor Watkins, The Swansea Vale Railway, Lightmoor Press, Lydney, 2017, 978-1-911038-19-1 In 1834 the Benson family purchased land at the Tyrllandwr Estate and as Swansea harbour developed this gave the family, led by Starling Benson, considerable wharfage land, encouraging the business of shipping coal. The needed transport and in 1839 they commissioned George Bush to survey for a railway. The west bank of the Tawe was heavily developed at this time and his scheme was on the east bank to Abercrave. Public notice was given in 1840 of the intention to build this railway, but in fact it lapsed, probably due to opposition from the Duke of Beaufort. Nevertheless, Benson and his partners repaired and modernised the 1812 tramroad and made some extension to it over land in their possession, thus not needing Parliamentary authorisation. Transition to a railway In 1845 the partners transferred their interest to a joint stock company, and in 1846 the tramroad was formally purchased. The name \\"Swansea Vale Railway\\" was first used at this time. This appears to mark the change from operating as a tramroad to being a railway. South Wales Railway The South Wales Railway was authorised in 1845 to build a broad gauge railway from near Gloucester to Milford Haven, connecting South Wales with the Great Western Railway network to London. Its route intersected the route of the Swansea Vale Railway. The SVR hoped to sell its line to the South Wales Railway, and the SWR was amenable, but did not have the Parliamentary powers to make the purchase. As a means of by-passing this obstacle, the South Wales Railway sponsored a nominally independent company, the Swansea Valley Railway, to take over the SVR and alter it to the broad gauge. The Swansea Valley Railway Bill was passed in Parliament on 2 July 1847, but with the condition that it could not be sold on to the South Wales Railway until at last half of the authorised capital had been raised and expended on construction. As there was no intention to raise capital or construct anything, this resulted in a stalemate.D S M Barrie, revised Peter Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 12: South Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1994, In March 1850 the construction of the South Wales Railway reached Llansamlet, and a flat crossing was made by the SWR of the SVR line. To optimise their own gradients they lifted the SVR track, which was of stone block sleeper construction, and this caused a minor argument as the SVR had not been asked for permission. Continuing independently It was now obvious to the Swansea Vale Railway directors that their line would remain independent for the foreseeable future, so they assessed what needed to be done to secure the future. Some attempts were made to obtain authorisation for passenger operation, and finally in 1855 the Company obtained an Act of Parliament incorporating it, and authorising passenger operation, and permitting extension to Pontardawe, and southwards to the New Cut in Swansea. To neutralise objections in Parliament from the South Wales Railway, it undertook that a third rail (to make mixed gauge track) would be laid southward from the intersection with the South Wales Railway, allowing broad gauge traffic access down to Swansea. The capital of the newly incorporated company was ¬£117,000. The South Wales Railway agreed to alter the intersection so as to separate the levels of the two lines, and to build a transhipment shed there to reload goods from narrow gauge to broad gauge wagons. These works were completed in 1857.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I: 1833 - 1863, part 2, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927 In 1855 the SVR railway was said to be open for a distance of miles and only carrying mineral traffic; this amounted to 1,000 tons per dayMiles, Thomas and Watkins page 19 with an annual income exceeding ¬£5,000. In 1856 the Company obtained a further Act authorising further northward extension to Ystalyfera and Ystradgynlais.From Miles, Thomas and Watkins. The reference to Ystadgynlais is probably to the pits near there. The Ystradgynlais station of the Neath and Brecon Railway did not get built until 1876, and was not on the same line. Through the period from 1856 the company seems to have had trouble raising money for capital works, and a preference share issue was authorised in 1859, although the trading position of the railway was profitable throughout this period. Passengers Passenger operation had been authorised and the preparations made for opening from Swansea to Pontardawe for passengers. Captain Ross of the Board of Trade visited the line but he found deficiencies, and declined to permit passenger running. Improvements were made and when Colonel Rich of the Board of Trade made a follow-up visit on 20 February 1860 he was satisfied, and passenger trains started running the following day, 21 February 1860. The passenger business was buoyant, and further third-class carriages had to be acquired. Receipts for the half year to August 1860 were ¬£4,912 compared with the previous ¬£3,693, and operating expenses were now ¬£1,740, and rent and rates ¬£683. In later years the practice was usually that the preference shareholders were paid their full dividend but that ordinary shareholders got nothing. Extending the line The northward extension had been authorised, but actual construction was slow, largely due to the poor level of subscription for shares. In September 1860 the board decided to open the line as far as a temporary terminus at Ynisygeinon.Later usually spelt Ynysygeinon. Late in 1860 the passenger service was extended to that place.Miles et al; Barrie and Baughan say 21 January 1861, and Quick agrees. The extension to Ystalyfera was opened on 20 November 1861. =Swansea Vale and Neath & Brecon Junction Railway= An essential part of any through route between Hereford and Swansea was the completion of the Swansea Vale and Neath & Brecon Junction Railway, commonly referred to as The Junction Line. This was to run between Colbren Junction on the N&BR; to Ynysygeinon on the SVR. Even without Midland Railway involvement, this had been desirable for the N&BR; company, giving better access to Swansea than running via Neath. The Swansea Vale and Neath & Brecon Junction Railway was promoted in 1863 to build a line connecting the Swansea Vale Railway at Ynysygeinon with the Neath and Brecon Railway at Colbren. The Swansea Vale Railway considered that it would abstract traffic from its line and it decided to petition against it in Parliament. This was not successful, and the SVR&N;&BR; obtained the Royal Assent in to its Act on 29 July 1864. The SVR&B;&NJR; ran into serious financial difficulty; it was unable to secure the subscriptions for shares that it needed to start construction. It entered into a complex arrangement with a contractor, John Dickson, but he fell into bankruptcy at a time when he himself was heavily indebted to the company. For some time, work on the SV&N;&BJR; was in abeyance. As a moribund company whose only asset was the power to build a line, it was absorbed by the Neath and Brecon Railway in July 1869, and construction was completed and it was opened to traffic on 10 November 1873. From that time the N&BR; started to run a passenger service between Brecon and Swansea, using the SVR&N;&BJR; line and the Swansea Vale Railway, over which it had running powers. The SV&N;&BJR; was to be leased by the N&BR; on completion, but when it was clear that no progress toward that goal was being made, it was amalgamated with the Neath and Brecon Railway on 26 July 1869. A F N Barnsdale, The Neath and Brecon Railway, in the Railway Magazine, September 1939. =Brynamman= The Llanelly Railway had reached Brynamman from the west in 1842 and was well established in serving the pits there. The coal industry there and in the vicinity was of prime importance and the SVR decided to build a line to it. In 1863 the SVR submitted a Bill for more capital at a level of ¬£48,000 to pay for the Brynamman extension and more rolling stock. It was probably opened to goods traffic in stages, and to passengers throughout on 2 March 1868. The branch off it from Gwys to Brynhenllys Colliery did not open until 1875. The Llanelly Railway at Brynamman was considered to be an ally, not a competitor, and a connection between the two companies at Brynamman was under construction. The Llanelly Railway was running passenger trains to Brynamman from 20 March 1865. Through goods and mineral traffic was soon being run over this route, from Swansea to the West Midlands via Brynamman, representing a more convenient through route.Michael Denman, The Llanelly Railway and Dock Company: The Heart of Wales Pioneer, published by The Wider View, Ilminster, 2012, Revenue increased to ¬£9512 by the middle of 1864; the increase was said to be largely due to traffic coming from Llanelly Railway and the Vale of Neath Railway (which was by now mixed gauge) via the Swansea and Neath Railway. =Morriston Loop= The main line had been built on the eastern bank, as it was less developed and land acquisition was expected to be cheaper. Of course, most of the industry and population were on the western bank, and the railway could not serve them directly. The Board decided to propose a Morriston branch; it was to be a loop line off the existing main line, leaving at Upper Boat station and rejoining the original line at Glais. Powers for the construction were granted in 1867. It was submitted for inspection to the Board of Trade for passenger operation, and Colonel Hutchinson visited for the purpose; everything was satisfactory and the first part of the line between Morriston and Upper Bank was opened for goods traffic on 6 October 1871.Miles et al, page 31. The authors do not explain the linkage between the BoT inspection and the opening for goods only, nor say when passenger opening took place. The section probably opened for passenger traffic on 15 March 1871.Explanatory note in Quick, although making clear the uncertainty. The full length of the Morriston Loop was opened on 2 October 1871 and from that date all passenger trains ran via Morriston and Clydach, with a new station at Glais. The old station at Llansamlet was retained for goods but closed to passengers and Birchgrove closed completely, so the old main line between Glais and Upper Bank was now operated by goods trains only. In the second half of 1872, the dividend on ordinary shares for the year reached 6%. The Midland Railway For some time, the directors of the SVR had believed that sale to a larger company was the solution to their long-standing financial difficulties. Richard Moon and a party of directors of the London and North Western Railway visited the Llanelly Railway in April 1864, and had special train trip over Swansea Vale Railway, but the LNWR was really interested in completion of what became the Central Wales line, and expressed no desire to treat with the Swansea Vale.George P Neele, Railway Reminiscences, McCorquodale & Co. Limited, London, 1904, page 160 onwards The Midland Railway was negotiating with the Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway in 1869. The Midland had a presence in Hereford from Worcester, and was known to aspire to reach South Wales. It was obvious that a route over the HH&BR;, the Neath and Brecon Railway and the Swansea Vale Railway would achieve that objective. On 13 December 1869 the Swansea Vale Railway Board had formal discussions with representatives of the Midland Railway; the negotiation was successful, but did not lead to an immediate arrangement. Nevertheless, in August 1870 the Midland Railway agreed to lend ¬£10,000 to the Swansea Vale Railway; the sum was later raised to ¬£20,000. On 23 August 1872 it was announced that the directors had agreed with the Midland Railway, that they would lease the Swansea Vale Railway. SVR shareholders would receive a permanent 6% dividend. Incidentally the Midland Railway was not interested in this kind of arrangement with the Neath and Brecon Railway, (which had taken over the SVJ&N;&BR;), as the N&BR; was considerably over-capitalised, following a series of financial improprieties and the failure of a contractor who was also financing much of the construction personally.Gwyn Briwnant Jones and Denis Dunstone, The Origins of the LMS in South Wales, Gomer Press, Ceredigion, 1999, Gwyn Briwnant Jones, Denis Dunstone and Tudor Watkins, The Neath and Brecon Railway: A History, Gomer press, Llandysul, 2005, D S M Barrie, The Brecon and Merthyr Railway, The Oakwood Press, Trowbridge, 1957 reprinted 1980, The capital of the Swansea Vale Railway at this time was ¬£230,392, and there were loans in existence to the extent of ¬£328,040.Miles, page 32 The lease of the Swansea Vale Railway by the Midland was authorised by Act of 30 July 1874; the Midland actually took possession in September 1874.H Morgan, South Wales Branch Lines, by Ian Allan Ltd, Shepperton, 1984, From this time the Swansea Vale Railway Company was only a financial entity, receiving the lease charge. Nevertheless, considerable capital expenditure was now being undertaken by the Midland Railway on bringing the SVR track and structures up to date, and this complicated the financial relationship. Accordingly, it was agreed that the Midland Company would absorb the SVR; an Act to authorise this was obtained on 11 August 1876 and the SVR Company wound up its affairs and ceased to exist. The SVR under Midland control When the Midland Railway took full control of the SVR and the SVR&N;&BJR;, it had already been running its trains on the line under running powers arrangements. The high dividends paid in the final years of the SVR's independent existence had been achieved by not doing enough maintenance of the line or locomotives. There were a number of track-related derailments in the early period of Midland ownership, and Miles et al attribute them to lack of maintenance. The Midland was no doubt aware of the poor state of the infrastructure of the network it had acquired, and it quickly set about modernising it; track replacement was an early priority, followed by the renewal of some bridges. Two bridges at Brynamman were renewed in 1875, and the Midland installed signal boxes and block signalling (for the first time probably) during 1875 and 1876 In 1876 the Midland opened a new goods depot at Swansea on the link line between Swansea St Thomas station and the Eastern Docks. The line was owned by the GWR and access to the depot was under running powers. The Swansea Vale Railway had running powers over the Neath and Brecon Railway, so the Midland Railway, as successor to the SVR, ran through trains over the N&BR.; The Midland Railway offered to operate all the N&BR; domestic trains north of Colbren Junction for one third of receipts, about ¬£4,000 annually. The N&BR; reluctantly accepted this arrangement from 1 July 1877 for five years, and the N&BR; only operated trains between Colbren Junction and Neath. The arrangement was renewed until in 1889, with the arrival of Sir Edward Watkin as Chairman, the N&BR; tried to negotiate better terms. When the talks broke down the Midland Railway abruptly discontinued the through trains on 1 July 1889. For several days there was no service whatever on the N&BR; route. The matter went to arbitration and the Midland Railway resumed working the trains from 22 July 1889. In 1881 the GWR built a branch line to Morriston, and it extended northwards from Morriston itself to Tyrcanol, a distance of about half a mile. The GWR requested a junction at this point, as the two lines were very close together, and this was installed in May 1881; however, it was never used and it was removed in 1883. In June 1891 a new marshalling yard was commissioned at Ynysygeinon to handle the colliery traffic coming down the valley. The GWR had long felt that its network around Swansea was inadequate for efficient handling of its traffic, and in 1911 it promoted the Swansea District line, a new route by-passing Swansea. It intersected the Midland line north of Morriston, and was opened in 1913. At the same time the GWR got authorisation for a line ten miles long from Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen to the Swansea District Line through the Upper Clydach Valley and Pontardawe. Actual construction was delayed by GWR and then by World War I, but a part of it opened in 1922 from Felin Fran to Clydach and in 1923 to Trebanos just south of Potardawe. From 31 December 1916 the through carriages from Swansea to Birmingham were withdrawn. The transit was very slow and patronage had never been enough to justify the service. After 1918 the effect of passenger road omnibuses was felt by the line; at this period they were slower than the trains, but they ran direct to the centre of Swansea, and often more conveniently through the centre of towns and villages on the route. St Thomas station had been complained of in the past for its lack of proximity to the centre of Swansea. Grouping of the railways Following the Railways Act 1922 most of the main line railways of Great Britain were compulsorily merged into one or other of four new large companies, the \\"groups\\"; this took effect during 1922. The Midland Railway was a constituent of the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway, as was also the LNWR. The LMS therefore had two routes from Swansea to the Midlands and north, and the former LNWR route was considered to be more convenient operationally. The discontinuation of the Swansea to Birmingham through carriages in 1916 was now followed by the suspension of through carriages from Swansea to Brecon, from 31 December 1930. The GWR took over responsibility for local passenger and goods services south of Colbren and the LMS ran a connecting service from Colbren on the Neath and Brecon line to Ynysygeinon, but this was unsuccessful, and was itself discontinued form 12 September 1932. On the same date the through goods traffic was re-routed to the former LNWR line. The SVR network continued to prosper, mainly because of the high quality anthracite mined within its area; this was considered a premium product, and much was exported to Canada and to France. Nationalisation The railways of Great Britain were nationalised at the beginning of 1948. The passenger business had collapsed in the 1930s and the new owner, British Railways, took stock of the situation; the assessment resulted in SVR passenger services being withdrawn from 25 September 1950.Peter Dale, Glamorgan's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing Limited, 2014, At the same time the traditional industries were by now in steep decline, and many of the anthracite mines closed down. As these were by far the dominant business of the former SVR network, it too suffered. The Morriston Loop was severed between Glais Junction and the Mond Works just to the north of Clydach in 1956, and the section between Clydach and Morriston closed in 1965. The Brynamman line was cut back to Gurnos in September 1964. Traffic from Ynyscedwyn ceased 1968 resulting in closure of the line north of the Imperial Smelting Works at Llansamlet, and the entire Llansamlet line closed in 1971. Traffic to Llansamlet itself ceased in 1973; the Llansamlet line was closed formally in September 1982, having been dormant for many years. The entire line closed formally on 24 May 1983 and SVR ceased to be a commercial railway. Heritage railway After closure, a heritage group named the Swansea Vale Railway Society, leased a section of track between Upper Bank and Six Pit; in 2007 the lease expired, and the group merged with the Gwili Railway in Carmarthen, and moved most of their rolling stock there.

The domestic policies advocated by the adherents of the New Politics movement stressed strong support for civil rights legislation, while in foreign affairs the movement favored a less aggressive posture toward the Soviet Union (criticizing \\"Cold War liberals\\" within the party such as Harry Truman and Dean Acheson), prompting its critics to accuse it of being \\"soft on Communism.\\" Younger adults accounted for many of its members, and provided it with an aura of youthful vibrance  this fact leading some opponents to attempt to link it to so-called \\"beatniks\\" (that term having been coined in 1958 by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen).

Early life Foveaux was baptised on 6 April 1767 at Ampthill, Bedfordshire, England, the sixth child of Joseph Foveaux and his wife Elizabeth, n√©e Wheeler. Family tradition maintains he was actually born almost a year earlier, on 10 April 1766.Joseph Foveaux page by Anne-Maree Whitaker Foveaux was an ensign in the 60th regiment and then joined the New South Wales Corps in June 1789 as lieutenant and reached Sydney in 1791. There he was promoted to major and, as senior officer between August 1796 and November 1799, he controlled the Corps at a time when the senior officers were making fortunes from trading and extending their lands. He soon became the largest landholder and stock-owner in the colony. Norfolk island In 1800, having established a reputation as an able and efficient administrator, Foveaux offered to go to Norfolk Island as Lieutenant-Governor. Finding the island run down, he built it up with particular attention to public works, for which he earned the praise of Governor King. During this period, part of the first settlement of Norfolk Island (1788‚Äì1814), Norfolk Island was basically a free settlement with convicts making up no more than 10 per cent of the population. While some individuals were sent from Sydney as a means of isolation, the Island was not a place of secondary punishment as it became in the second settlement (1825‚Äì1855). Judgements of Foveaux's career are often clouded by a manuscript purporting to be the recollections of Norfolk Island gaoler Robert Jones. This document is dated 1823, five years after Jones's death. It contains paintings of buildings on Norfolk Island which were not erected until the 1840s. Modern scholarship reveals it to be a forgery from after 1850 which contains no valid evidence on Foveaux's life and career. Robert Hughes writing in The Fatal Shore describes Foveaux as brutal in his dealings with convicts. In September 1804 Foveaux left Norfolk Island for England to attend to his private affairs and seek relief for the asthma that affected him. Aftermath of the Rum Rebellion Having recovered, he returned to New South Wales on the Sinclair to serve as Lieutenant-Governor, but on arrival in July 1808, he found Governor Bligh under arrest by officers of the New South Wales Corps in the event known as the Rum Rebellion. Foveaux assumed control, stating that he was not favouring either Bligh or the rebels. His control was characterised by a desire for cheap and efficient administration, improvement of public works, and encouragement of small-holders. In January 1809, the acting Lieutenant- Governor, Colonel William Paterson, returned and Foveaux remained to assist him and his successor, Major-General Lachlan Macquarie. Macquarie was impressed with Foveaux's administration and put him forward as Collins's successor as Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land, because he could think of no one more fitting, and considered that he could not have acted otherwise with regard to Bligh. However, when Foveaux returned to England in 1810, Macquarie's recommendation was put aside. Foveaux was promoted to Inspecting Field Officer in Ireland and in 1814 became a major-general. Later life He pursued an uneventful military career after that, rising to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1830. In 1814 he married Ann Sherwin, his partner since 1793, and they had a daughter born in 1801. He died in London on 20 March 1846 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.  Surry Hills  Surry Hills near the centre of Sydney was once a farming area owned by Foveaux. His property was known as Surry Hills Farm, named after the Surrey Hills in Surrey, England. Legacy Foveaux Strait in New Zealand is named in his honour, as are streets in the Sydney suburbs of Airds, Barden Ridge, Bella Vista, Cromer, Harrington Park, Lurnea and Surry Hills, the Maitland suburb of Metford, and the Canberra suburb of Ainslie.

The Canningites were distinct within the Tory party because they favoured Catholic emancipation and free trade. After the incapacity of Lord Liverpool in 1827, Canning was asked to form a government. Because Canning did not have the full support of the Tory party, which was split between Canningites and Ultra-Tories, he created a coalition government with his Canningites allying themselves with the Whigs. Canning died in August 1827 and the Canningite Lord Goderich became Prime Minister, but his government collapsed in January 1828. The Canningites then allied themselves with the Tories, led by the Duke of Wellington. They resigned in May 1828, though, on the issue of allocating seats from disenfranchised corrupt boroughs to the new growing cities of England. Now usually known as the 'Huskissonites' (after their new leader, William Huskisson) the group numbered a bare dozen or so in the House of Commons, with greater support in the House of Lords. For the next year and half they acted a separate group between the two main parties, and were courted by both. After Huskisson died in 1830 (in a railway accident, the first recorded casualty of this new form of transport), the remainder of the group decided to join the Whigs and voted against the Tory government in a parliament in favour of electoral reform. Wellington resigned as prime minister and the surviving Canningite/Huskissonites joined the new Whig cabinet of Earl Grey in November 1830.

It was first released as a hardcover in September 1998. Almost a year later, in August 1999, its first mass market edition was published. An ebook reprint was published in 2011. Bloom is one of Borders' \\"Best 10 Books of 1998\\" and is a New York Times Notable Book. The premise of the book is how to handle human technology that has evolved beyond human control. Plot summary Bloom is set in the year 2106, in a world where self-replicating nanomachines called \\"Mycora\\" have consumed Earth and other planets of the inner solar system, forcing humankind to eke out a bleak living in the asteroids and Galilean moons. Two groups of humanity are described‚ÄîThe Immunity, who use \\"ladderdown\\" technology and augmented reality and live on the moons of Jupiter, and The Gladholders, who use human intelligence amplification and artificial intelligence and live in the asteroid belt. The story begins on Ganymede with an article about a ‚Äúbloom‚Äù, or outbreak of Mycora, that serves to emphasize the danger and horror of this technogenic life (TGL). The article is written by Strasheim, the primary narrator character. He is first seen in the office of Chief of Imunnology Lottick, the effective ruler of Ganemede, who has called him there for an unknown purpose. Lottick tells Strasheim that the Mycora have apparently been stealing or assimilating human designed defensive nanotech and may soon develop resistance to the coldness of the outer solar system, which incites concern. It is planned to send mission to drop TGL detectors onto the polar ice caps of Mars, Earth, and the Moon, and Lottick asks Strasheim to go along as a reporter. For the longer term, a starship is being constructed to colonize other star systems before the Mycora. Strasheim agrees, and goes to meet the other crew- members and inspect the ship, which is called the Louis Pasteur. The ship is technologically camouflaged to protect the crew against Mycora. A terrorist attack releases a Mycora bloom in the hangar, killing one crew member and forcing the others to launch the Pasteur and escape‚Äîdeparting three weeks earlier than planned, and without adequate supplies. Because of their forced launch, the Pasteur docks at Saint Helier, a medium-sized Floral asteroid of the Gladholders to pick up supplies. While there, they are surprised by the culture multiple times, but what shocks them most is that the asteroid's inhabitants have apparently discovered, through powerful telescopes, human life on both Earth and Venus, co-existing with the Mycora. The \\"Pasteur\\" is pursued by ships of the Temples of Transcendent Evolution, a fringe political/religious group that believes the Mycora are divine, investing large sums of money in researching them. Searching for ways to defend themselves against the Temple ships, the crew discover that the mission has a somewhat more violent purpose than they were led to believe. The \\"detectors\\" they have by this time dropped on Mars, Earth, and Luna can actually be repurposed as \\"cascade fusion\\" devices. Shaken, the crew continues on their journey, but become aware that one of the crew is sabotaging the mission. The saboteur turns out to be the Mycorea specialist Baucum, with whom Strasheim has developed a personal relationship. She is secretly a member of the Temples of Transcendent Evolution, and after being discovered, Baucum ruptures a storage bag inside herself that had been carrying spores of Mycora. Terrified, the crew responds, with Strasheim himself shoving her out an airlock before the Mycora now consuming her can also devour the ship. It is determined that the mission's actual purpose was to use the detector/bombs to establish small footholds on the three planetary bodies, but it occurs to Strasheim that if such a device were detonated in the Sun, a massive blast of laddered-down iron would wipe out most Mycoran life in the inner solar system. Several of the Temples' ships that have chased them since Mars, are now desperately attempting to destroy the Pasteur against this possibility (The Pasteur is heading toward the Sun to get away from the Mycosystem via an out-of-plane slingshot, but the action could have been construed differently by Temples' agents.). Having discovered this possibility, the crew decide not to pursue it, but instead transmit the existence of this potential weapon back to the outer solar system. As a result of the energy of this high power transmition the Mycora break through the hull of the Pasteur, blooming, and unexpectedly assuming the form of a pseudo-human spokesperson. It transpires that the Mycora is sapient and without ill-will toward humans. Communication is brief but paradigm-shattering. The ambassador explains that the majority of persons consumed during the destruction of Earth or on the evacuation out-system was incorporated into the Mycosystem and are still alive in some sense, their consciousness and intelligence adjusted to run on the cellular-automata-like Mycora substrate, or \\"Unpacked\\". The crew is given information on how to mark areas as off-limits to the Mycosystem. They are told that humanity is, \\"...Utterly free. Free to conduct your lives in the classical manner, to escape this solar system, to populate the stars. Free to Unpack, if you choose.\\" The book ends almost thirteen years later, with a description of how the captain of the Pasteur has been diagnosed with a terminal disease and requests that Strasheim (now a successful media magnate) be his witness as he joins the Mycora.McCarthy, Wil: Bloom, Del Ray Books, 1998 Characters * John Strasheim ‚Äì The main character. Works as a cobbler on Ganymede, but is also a very good amateur journalist. It is the latter skill which causes him to be selected for the journey to the Earth. * Vaclav Lottick ‚Äì Introduced as the most powerful man in the solar system, he is the head of research for the Immunity and the man who invites Strasheim on the mission to earth. * Darren Wallich - Captain of the Louis Pasteur, has had a ‚Äútickle capacitor‚Äù implant, which makes his personality seem more likable. * Tosca Lehne ‚Äì Another crewmember. One of the inventors of the t-balance, which coats the outside of the Pasteur with the purpose of making it appear to be part of the Mycosystem. * Jenna Davenroy ‚Äì A nuclear engineer in her 40s. She is the ladderdown expert on the Pasteur and also its chief propulsion monitor. * Tug Jinacio ‚Äì A Response lieutenant, responsible for handling emergencies on the Pasteur (ex. fire, bloom, etc.) Killed in the hangar bloom. * Renata Baucum ‚Äì Bioanalyst on the Pasteur, who turns out to be a traitor. Killed when she ruptures the Mycora hidden within her and Strasheim blows her out of an airlock. * Sudhir Rapisardi ‚Äì Coordinated the design of the TGL (technogenic life) detectors that the Pasteur will place on the earth to monitor the Mycora. Is the biophysicist on the Pasteur. * Chris Dibrin ‚Äì sent by the Governor to show the Pasteur crew around Saint Helier. He has an artificial intelligence implanted into his brain that enables him to think faster. The Louis Pasteur Spaceship Named after Louis Pasteur the French microbiologist and chemist, the ship is described as being very small and having an unusual external covering invented by Lehne called the t-balance. According to Strasheim, the Pasteur is \\"like a bathroom with seven shower stalls and a streetcar cockpit wedged incongruously at one end, a utility closet wedged in the other.\\" Rather cramped quarters for a crew of seven going on a voyage that will take about two years. The purpose of the t-balance is to convince the Mycora that the ship is part of it by means of tactile camouflage. It is described as a gleaming rainbow gray colored coating that appeared to be made up of millions of minuscule dots, each of which also appears to be made up of millions of tiny dots, and so on. The t-balance also gives off the illusion that the dots are moving. Unfortunately for the Pasteur's crew, although the t-balance should work in theory, it has not yet been tested because the only way to do so is by surrounding it with Mycora. Places * Ganymede: Where the story begins. It is one of Jupiter's moons and home to people who are protected from the Mycora by the Immunity. * Ansharton: A large city on Ganymede where Lottick's office is. * Philusburg: A smaller city on Ganymede where Strasheim and his mother live. * Galileo: The city/base/port where the Pasteur is docked on Ganymede. * Saint Helier: A Floral asteroid where the Pasteur docks to stock up on supplies. Terms/Organizations * Immunity: A defensive system used by the people on Ganymede (as well as those on the other outer planets) to keep spores of Mycora from invading. Also a term used by people under its protection to refer to themselves. * Ladderdown: System of converting elements into other elements further down the Periodic Table. As a result of using this system, the inhabitants of the Immunity have a plethora of high-numbered elements lying around. For example, they have so much gold they use it to weigh down their shoes and pave the streets. * Mycora: A substance that appears to be grey goo, but is in actuality a type of technogenic life form created by humans that escaped their control and began consuming everything around it. It has also evolved from its original state and adapted to an environment where there is nothing left to consume. Throughout the book, Conway's Game of Life is used as an imperfect example of how the Mycora operates. * Temples of Transcendent Evolution: Originally formed on Callisto, it is an organization that invests large sums of money into research about the Mycora. They are spiritually inclined and believe that the Mycora is \\"a presence greater than themselves\\".

It rises in the western highlands of Guatemala where it is also called R√≠o Grande, and runs in an easterly direction to the Gulf of Honduras. The final few kilometres of the river form part of the Guatemala‚ÄìHonduras border. The Motagua River basin covers an area of and is the largest in Guatemala. Overview The river runs in a valley that has the only known source of jadeitite (jade) in Mesoamerica, and was an important commerce route during the Pre-Columbian era. The important Maya site of Quirigua is near the river's north bank, as are several smaller sites with jade quarries and workshops. The Motagua river valley also marks the Motagua Fault, the tectonic boundary between the North American and the Caribbean Plates.

Both buildings are official monuments.Engelbert Hendrik Kuile (1967) Delftse studi√´n: Een bundel historische opstellen over de stad Delft. p.423 The fraternity is considered smaller and therefore more accessible than other student fraternities in Delft, while retaining its traditions and mores. It offers cheap student dinners for both members and non-members, as well as coffee and tea in a coffee-bar called Oele. The fraternity's history has been summarized in the 1997 book ‚ÄúBroederlijcken Liiefde‚Äù and the 2007 documentary film ‚ÄúLiieve Leden‚Äù. Eating Sint Jansbrug has an 'open eettafel'. This means that everyone can come in and have dinner here. The 'eettafel' is open from 17.30 to 19.30 for everyone who would like a divers and nice meal. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday a meal is just 4.00 euros, the other days it's 3.75 euros. This is because on Monday, Wednesday and Friday you'll get soup and service. Every meal consists of a basic meal (meat or vegetarian), salad and an option to get some more if you would like that. Oele Oele is the coffee cafe on the top floor of Sint Jansbrug. On every weekday, both members and non-members can enjoy coffee/tea and free cookies. Every Friday, Oele is transformed into a full-featured bar, serving all kinds of beers and liquors. Oele is run by eight second year student members of Sint Jansbrug. Every year a new group of students starts running the attic. Frieze Oude Delft 50. Jaarclubs (or year groups) Every year new members of Sint Jansbrug form so called Jaarclubs (year groups). These groups consist of about 11 to 15 members form the same year. Sint Jansbrug has both men-only and ladies-only yearclubs, but it has also mixed yearclubs. These groups usually meet once a week. Gilden Besides jaarclubs there are gilden (Dutch for guilds) as well. Although the name is derived from the historical craft guild, within Sint Jansbrug it is somewhat different. A gilde consists of members of Sint Jansbrug from different years who share similar interests. To become a member of a guild you have to be invited by existing members of that guild. Only members of the 2nd year or higher can be invited. Sint Jansbrug recognises 13 different guilds, each with its own characteristics. Not every member of Sint Jansbrug gets invited by a guild and not every invited member will eventually become a member of that particular guild.  References  External links * Homepage of the D.S.V.

A native of Bay Village, Ohio, Laughner was described by Richie Unterberger as \\"probably the single biggest catalyst in the birth of Cleveland's alternative rock scene in the mid 1970s.\\" Music career Laughner led a variety of groups. Among them were Mr. Charlie, Cinderella Backstreet, Peter & The Wolves, The Blue Drivers and Friction. However, his most enduring contributions were to Rocket From The Tombs and the early work of Pere Ubu. In addition to all this, he wrote for Creem magazine. Laughner was a voracious rock fan and writer, and was heavily influenced by the writings of Lester Bangs. Like Bangs, Laughner admired Lou Reed, but also drew inspiration from folk and blues figures such as Robert Johnson and Woody Guthrie. Tom Verlaine was also one of Laughner's idols.Peter Laughner is dead, Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung: The Work of a Legendary Critic, collected writings, Greil Marcus, ed. Anchor Press, 1988. () Laughner was briefly considered as a replacement for Richard Lloyd when he departed Television, a band he championed from their earliest days. However, Richard Lloyd disputes this. Death Laughner had severe drug and alcohol abuse problems that ultimately led to his death by acute pancreatitis in 1977 at the age of 24. Lester Bangs wrote a eulogy for him, simply titled \\"Peter Laughner is Dead\\". Rumors to the effect that Laughner was despondent, even suicidal, at the time of his death have been contradicted by Laughner's last known message, written and mailed to Cleveland singer Ruby Port on the evening prior to his death. This letter revealed his intent to move to a retreat in the Ohio countryside, where he could write new music as well as rest and regain his health. Recordings Laughner's only known entrance into a recording studio was for the Pere Ubu single sessions, though he left behind countless lo-fi live, rehearsal, and demo recordings. In 1994, Tim/Kerr label released Take the Guitar Player for a Ride, a 15-track LP drawn from these tapes, later re- released as a CD. This compilation sold poorly and has since gone out of print. Fans continue to circulate bootleg recordings and a Cleveland-based label, Handsome Productions, offers a comprehensive collection of his music on CD, officially endorsed by his estate. In June 2019, the Smog Veil record label released a 5-disc Laughner box set (with tapes procured from Handsome Productions, Pere Ubu's David Thomas, Tim Wright, and others). In addition to solo recordings, Laughner's live guitar and vocal work is available in the posthumous Rocket from the Tombs album The Day the Earth Met the Rocket from the Tombs.

It was introduced in this context in 1988/89 by Stephane Mallat and Yves Meyer and has predecessors in the microlocal analysis in the theory of differential equations (the ironing method) and the pyramid methods of image processing as introduced in 1981/83 by Peter J. Burt, Edward H. Adelson and James L. Crowley. Definition A multiresolution analysis of the Lebesgue space L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}) consists of a sequence of nested subspaces ::\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}\\\\dots\\\\subset V_1\\\\subset V_0\\\\subset V_{-1}\\\\subset\\\\dots\\\\subset V_{-n}\\\\subset V_{-(n+1)}\\\\subset\\\\dots\\\\subset L^2(\\\\R) that satisfies certain self-similarity relations in time-space and scale-frequency, as well as completeness and regularity relations. * Self-similarity in time demands that each subspace Vk is invariant under shifts by integer multiples of 2k. That is, for each f\\\\in V_k,\\\\; m\\\\in\\\\Z the function g defined as g(x)=f(x-m2^{k}) also contained in V_k. * Self-similarity in scale demands that all subspaces V_k\\\\subset V_l,\\\\; k>l, are time-scaled versions of each other, with scaling respectively dilation factor 2k-l. I.e., for each f\\\\in V_k there is a g\\\\in V_l with \\\\forall x\\\\in\\\\R:\\\\;g(x)=f(2^{k-l}x). * In the sequence of subspaces, for k>l the space resolution 2l of the l-th subspace is higher than the resolution 2k of the k-th subspace. * Regularity demands that the model subspace V0 be generated as the linear hull (algebraically or even topologically closed) of the integer shifts of one or a finite number of generating functions \\\\phi or \\\\phi_1,\\\\dots,\\\\phi_r. Those integer shifts should at least form a frame for the subspace V_0\\\\subset L^2(\\\\R) , which imposes certain conditions on the decay at infinity. The generating functions are also known as scaling functions or father wavelets. In most cases one demands of those functions to be piecewise continuous with compact support. * Completeness demands that those nested subspaces fill the whole space, i.e., their union should be dense in L^2(\\\\R) , and that they are not too redundant, i.e., their intersection should only contain the zero element.  Important conclusions  In the case of one continuous (or at least with bounded variation) compactly supported scaling function with orthogonal shifts, one may make a number of deductions. The proof of existence of this class of functions is due to Ingrid Daubechies. Assuming the scaling function has compact support, then V_0\\\\subset V_{-1} implies that there is a finite sequence of coefficients a_k=2 \\\\langle\\\\phi(x),\\\\phi(2x-k)\\\\rangle for k\\\\leq N, and a_k=0 for k>N, such that :\\\\phi(x)=\\\\sum_{k=-N}^N a_k\\\\phi(2x-k). Defining another function, known as mother wavelet or just the wavelet :\\\\psi(x):=\\\\sum_{k=-N}^N (-1)^k a_{1-k}\\\\phi(2x-k), one can show that the space W_0\\\\subset V_{-1}, which is defined as the (closed) linear hull of the mother wavelet's integer shifts, is the orthogonal complement to V_0 inside V_{-1}. Or put differently, V_{-1} is the orthogonal sum (denoted by \\\\oplus) of W_0 and V_0. By self-similarity, there are scaled versions W_k of W_0 and by completeness one has :L^2(\\\\R)=\\\\mbox{closure of }\\\\bigoplus_{k\\\\in\\\\Z}W_k, thus the set :\\\\\\\\{\\\\psi_{k,n}(x)=\\\\sqrt2^{-k}\\\\psi(2^{-k}x-n):\\\\;k,n\\\\in\\\\Z\\\\\\\\} is a countable complete orthonormal wavelet basis in L^2(\\\\R).

History Okahandja means the place where two rivers (Okakango and Okamita) flow into each other to form one wide one in Otjiherero.Otjozondjupa Regional Council A German pastor, Heinrich Schmelen, became the first European to visit the town in 1827. In 1844, two missionaries were permanently assigned to the town, Heinrich Kleinschmidt and Hugo Hahn. A church dates from this period. A military post was established at the initiative of Theodor Leutwein in 1894, and it is this date that is officially recognized as the town's founding.Okahandja History Okahandja.net, last accessed on 4 October 2017 A number of important historic Namibian people are buried in Okahandja, among them Maharero, Jan Jonker Afrikaner, Hosea Kutako and Clemens Kapuuo.

Today it belongs to the Trans-Namib railway network.  Education  In the 1870s Rhenish missionaries established the first school. The Augustineum School was reopened at Okahandja on 9 November 1905; it was later moved to Windhoek. Okahandja has six primary schools and two high schools. Namwater Vocational, situated outside the main town, is the only institute of higher education in Okahandja. The National Institute for Educational Development (NIED) is today situated in Okahandja. NIED was created after independence as the institute from where a new national system of education was created, replacing the previous racist system of apartheid.

It is associated with infertility, but many forms are amenable to medical treatment. In humans, azoospermia affects about 1% of the male population and may be seen in up to 20% of male infertility situations in Canada. Classification Azoospermia can be classified into three major types as listed. Many conditions listed may also cause various degrees of oligospermia rather than azoospermia. Pretesticular and testicular azoospermia are known as non-obstructive azoospermia, whereas post-testicular azoospermia is considered obstructive. =Pretesticular= Pretesticular azoospermia is characterized by inadequate stimulation of otherwise normal testicles and genital tract. Typically, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are low (hypogonadotropic) commensurate with inadequate stimulation of the testes to produce sperm. Examples include hypopituitarism (for various causes), hyperprolactinemia, and exogenous FSH suppression by testosterone. Chemotherapy may suppress spermatogenesis. Pretesticular azoospermia is seen in about 2% of azoospermia. Pretesticular azoospermia is a kind of non- obstructive azoospermia. =Testicular= In this situation the testes are abnormal, atrophic, or absent, and sperm production severely disturbed to absent. FSH levels tend to be elevated (hypergonadotropic) as the feedback loop is interrupted (lack of feedback inhibition on FSH). The condition is seen in 49‚Äì93% of men with azoospermia. Testicular failure includes absence of failure production as well as low production and maturation arrest during the process of spermatogenesis. Causes for testicular failure include congenital issues such as in certain genetic conditions (e.g. Klinefelter syndrome), some cases of cryptorchidism or Sertoli cell-only syndrome as well as acquired conditions by infection (orchitis), surgery (trauma, cancer), radiation, or other causes. Mast cells releasing inflammatory mediators appear to directly suppress sperm motility in a potentially reversible manner, and may be a common pathophysiological mechanism for many causes leading to inflammation. Testicular azoospermia is a kind of non-obstructive azoospermia. Generally, men with unexplained hypergonadotropic azoospermia need to undergo a chromosomal evaluation. =Post-testicular= In post-testicular azoospermia sperm are produced but not ejaculated, a condition that affects 7‚Äì51% of azoospermic men. The main cause is a physical obstruction (obstructive azoospermia) of the post-testicular genital tracts. The most common reason is a vasectomy done to induce contraceptive sterility. Other obstructions can be congenital (example agenesis of the vas deferens as seen in certain cases of cystic fibrosis) or acquired, such as ejaculatory duct obstruction for instance by infection. Ejaculatory disorders include retrograde ejaculation and anejaculation; in these conditions sperm are produced but not expelled. =Unknown= Idiopathic azoospermia is where there is no known cause of the condition. It may be a result of multiple risk factors, such as age and weight. For example, a review in 2013 came to the result that oligospermia and azoospermia are significantly associated with being overweight (odds ratio 1.1), obese (odds ratio 1.3) and morbidly obese (odds ratio 2.0), but the cause of this is unknown. The review found no significant relation between oligospermia and being underweight. Genetics Genetic factors can cause pretesticular, testicular, and post-testicular azoospermia (or oligospermia) and include the following situations: The frequency of chromosomal abnormalities is inversely proportional to the semen count, thus males with azoospermia are at risk to have a 10‚Äì15% (other sources citing 15‚Äì20% incidencePadubidri; Daftary (2011). Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology, 15e. p. 205. ) abnormalities on karyotyping versus about <1 % in the fertile male population. Pretesticular azoospermia may be caused by congential hypopituitarism, Kallmann syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and other genetic conditions that lead to GnRH or gonadotropin deficiency. Testicular azoospermia is seen in Klinefelter syndrome(XXY) and the XX male syndrome. In addition, 13% of men with azoospermia have a defective spermatogenesis that is linked to defects of the Y chromosome. Such defects tend to be de novo micro- deletions and affect usually the long arm of the chromosome. A section of the long arm of the Y chromosome has been termed Azoospermia Factor (AZF) at Yq11 and subdivided into AZFa, AZFb, AZFc and possibly more subsections. Defects in this area can lead to oligospermia or azoospermia, however, a tight genotype- phenotype correlation has not been achieved. Spermatogenesis is defective with gene defects for the androgen receptor. Post-testicular azoospermia can be seen with certain point mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene commonly associated with congenital vas deferens abnormalities. Genetic counselling is indicated for men with genetic causes of azoospermia. In terms of reproduction, it needs to be considered if the genetic defect could be transmitted to the offspring. =BRD7= BRD7, a transcription regulatory protein, is normally highly expressed in the testis. Absent or reduced expression of BRD7 protein was observed in the testes of azoospermia patients exhibiting spermatogenesis arrest. Homozygous knockout mice [BRD7(-/-)] are infertile and have higher levels of apoptosis and DNA damage in their germline cells. =Gene polymorphisms= The human breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) is employed in DNA repair. A common single nucleotide polymorphism in BRCA2 is associated with idiopathic male infertility with azoospermia. Four genes involved in DNA double-strand break repair and chromosome synapsis (TEX11, TEX15, MLH1 and MLH3) have key roles in genomic integrity, meiotic recombination and gametogenesis. Polymorphisms in these genes were tested for associations with male infertility. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in two of these genes (TEX11 and MLH3) were found to be associated with male infertility involving azoospermy or oligospermia. Diagnosis Algorithms for the workup of the infertile male. Algorithm to be considered on initial assessment (top). Algorithm for the management of the patient presenting with azoospermia (bottom). Azoospermia is usually detected in the course of an infertility investigation. It is established on the basis of two semen analysis evaluations done at separate occasions (when the seminal specimen after centrifugation shows no sperm under the microscope) and requires a further work-up.Esteves SC, Miyaoka R, Agarwal A. An update on the clinical assessment of the infertile male. Clinics (Sao Paulo). [corrected]. 2011;66(4):691‚Äì700. The investigation includes a history, a physical examination including a thorough evaluation of the scrotum and testes, laboratory tests, and possibly imaging. History includes the general health, sexual health, past fertility, libido, and sexual activity. Past exposure to a number of agents needs to be queried including medical agents like hormone/steroid therapy, antibiotics, 5-ASA inhibitors (sulfasalazine), alpha- blockers, 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, chemotherapeutic agents, pesticides, recreational drugs (marijuana, excessive alcohol), and heat exposure of the testes. A history of surgical procedures of the genital system needs to be elicited. The family history needs to be assessed to look for genetic abnormalities. Congenital absence of the vas deferens may be detectable on physical examination and can be confirmed by a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). If confirmed genetic testing for cystic fibrosis is in order. Transrectal ultrasound can also assess azoospermia caused by obstruction, or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct, such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied. Retrograde ejaculation is diagnosed by examining a post-ejaculatory urine for presence of sperm after making it alkaline and centrifuging it. Low levels of LH and FSH with low or normal testosterone levels are indicative of pretesticular problems, while high levels of gonadotropins indicate testicular problems. However, often this distinction is not clear and the differentiation between obstructive versus non-obstructive azoospermia may require a testicular biopsy. On the other hand, \\"In azoospermic men with a normal ejaculate volume, FSH serum level greater than two times the upper limit of the normal range is reliably diagnostic of dysfunctional spermatogenesis and, when found, a diagnostic testicular biopsy is usually unnecessary, although no consensus exists in this matter.\\" Fertil Steril. 2008;90(5 Suppl):S74-7.Coburn, M., Wheeler, T., and Lipshultz, L.I. Testicular biopsy. Its use and limitations. Urol Clin North Am. 1987; 14: 551‚Äì561. But also, extremely high levels of FSH (>45 ID/mL) have been correlated with successful microdissection testicular sperm extraction.Ramasamy R, Lin K, Gosden LV, Rosenwaks Z, Palermo GD, Schlegel PN. High serum FSH levels in men with nonobstructive azoospermia does not affect success of microdissection testicular sperm extraction. Fertil Steril. 2009;92(2):590-3. Serum inhibin-B weakly indicates presence of sperm cells in the testes, raising chances for successfully achieving pregnancy through testicular sperm extraction (TESE), although the association is not very substantial, having a sensitivity of 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56‚Äì0.74) and a specificity of 0.83 (CI: 0.64‚Äì0.93) for prediction the presence of sperm in the testes in non- obstructive azoospermia. Seminal plasma proteins TEX101 and ECM1 were recently proposed for the differential diagnosis of azoospermia forms and subtypes, and for prediction of TESE outcome. Mount Sinai Hospital, Canada started clinical trial to test this hypothesis in 2016.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02851966 It is recommended that men primary hypopituitarism may be linked to a genetic cause, a genetic evaluation is indicated in men with azoospermia due to primary hypopituitarism. Azoospermic men with testicular failure are advised to undergo karyotype and Y-micro-deletion testing. Treatment Pre- and post- testicular azoospermia are frequently correctible, while testicular azoospermia is usually permanent. In the former the cause of the azoospermia needs to be considered and it opens up possibilities to manage this situation directly. Thus men with azoospermia due to hyperprolactinemia may resume sperm production after treatment of hyperprolactinemia or men whose sperm production is suppressed by exogenous androgens are expected to produce sperm after cessation of androgen intake. In situations where the testes are normal but unstimulated, gonadotropin therapy can be expected to induce sperm production. A major advancement in recent years has been the introduction of IVF with ICSI which allows successful fertilization even with immature sperm or sperm obtained directly from testicular tissue. IVF-ICSI allows for pregnancy in couples where the man has irreversible testicular azoospermia as long as it is possible to recover sperm material from the testes. Thus men with non-mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome have fathered children using IVF-ICSI. Pregnancies have been achieved in situations where azoospermia was associated with cryptorchism and sperm where obtained by testicular sperm extraction (TESE). In men with post-testicular azoospermia a number of approaches are available. For obstructive azoospermia IVF-ICSI or surgery can be used and individual factors need to be considered for the choice of treatment. Medication may be helpful for retrograde ejaculation.

Many performers have devised their own variations of this trick. It is often billed as \\"the trick that fooled Winston Churchill\\" due to a story describing how it was performed for him during World War II. The method behind the trick is simple and essentially self-working, and can be enhanced by the presentation of the performer and the use of other principles of magic.  Effect  #The performer takes a deck of cards, and places on the table two face-up \\"marker\\" cards, one black and one red; the black on the left and the red on the right. The performer tells the spectator that he or she is going to deal cards face- down from the deck and the object of the exercise is for the subject to use their intuition to identify whether each card in the deck is black or red. #The performer takes one card at a time from the deck, face down, and asks the subject to attempt to divine whether it is black or red. The subject states their choice, and the performer then places the card in line with the appropriately coloured marker card, overlapping it at the bottom. #About halfway through the deck, the performer stops and announces that it is necessary to switch sides, in order to prevent a possible preference for one side over another from confusing the results. The performer deals two new marker cards onto the existing lines: a red one on the left, and a black one on the right. #The performer then continues as before, dealing cards face-down from the deck onto the subject's choice of the black or red line. #When the deck is exhausted, the performer instructs the subject to gather up and somehow reveal the left-hand line of cards; the performer does the same for the right-hand line. #The exposed lines reveal that every one of the subject's guesses was correct, and the black and red cards have been exactly sorted by colour. Method The deck in use is either stacked or partially stacked prior to performance, or manipulated in the course of performance to form a partial or full stack, in which there is a separation between the red and black cards, with a run of each colour comprising either half the deck or a substantial portion of the stack near the top. In the first round of dealing face-down cards, all of the cards dealt will be of one colour. The switching of sides occurs at the halfway point through the deck because that is the point at which the first colour cards will be exhausted and the second colour of cards will begin to be dealt. To understand why this enables the trick to work, think about what will be in the two lines of cards at the end of the trick. The left-hand line will begin with (for example) a black marker card (placed at the start), followed by the face-down black cards from the top of the deck, then the red marker card (placed at the side switch), then the face- down red cards from the bottom of the deck. That's (black marker) (black cards) (red marker) (red cards). In other words, this line is exactly right, and is given to the subject to gather up. The right-hand line will begin with the red marker card (placed at the start), followed by the face-down black cards from the top of the deck, then the black marker card (placed at the side switch), then the face-down red cards from the bottom of the deck. That's (red marker) (black cards) (black marker) (red cards). Although incorrect, this can be instantly made to appear correct by moving the red marker card from one end of the line to the other, or by reversing the order of all other cards in the line. This must be performed by the magician during the act of gathering up the right-hand line of cards, while the subject is distracted by gathering up their own line. Link with Winston Churchill Chapter 13 of the book Magician's Magic by Paul Curry describes a dinner party during World War II at which a magician named Harry Green performed the trick for Winston Churchill. According to the book, Churchill insisted that the trick be performed for him half a dozen times, and was left thoroughly baffled.
