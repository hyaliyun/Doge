It was located in Leelanau County in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Until it was decommissioned, it was Michigan's shortest state highway. M-209 started at M-109 and went just over mile (about ) to Glen Haven. In 1996, M-209's designation was \\"abandoned\\", and the road was turned over to the jurisdiction of the Leelanau County Road Commission. Route description The US Coast Guard Life Saving Station at Sleeping Bear Point, Glen Haven M-209 was the short connector route from M-109 to the Glen Haven unit of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore west of Glen Arbor. The southern terminus of the highway was at the intersection with M-109 south of Glen Haven, a restored logging village on the shore of Lake Michigan on the Leelanau Peninsula. The roadway ran north from this intersection where M-109 made a 90‚Äìdegree corner through the south and east legs of a four-way intersection with M-209 and Dune Valley Road. M-209 ran past such attractions as the restored General Store and Blacksmith Shop. Also located in Glen Haven is the former Glen Haven Canning Co. building. This building was first used as a warehouse and later as a cannery for cherries in the 1920s. It has since been restored as the Cannery Boathouse housing historic wooden boats used in the Manitou Passage between Glen Haven, Glen Arbor and the North and South Manitou islands. The northern terminus of M-209 was located in front of the former US Coast Guard Life Saving Station, now restored as a maritime museum. The museum is located at the intersection of Glen Haven Road and Sleeping Bear Dunes Road. At the time of decommissioning, M-209 was a two-lane, paved road. The restored Glen Haven General Store Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is a United States National Lakeshore located on the \\"little finger\\" of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan in Leelanau and Benzie counties. The park covers a stretch of Lake Michigan's eastern coastline, as well as North and South Manitou islands. The park was authorized on October 21, 1970. History From its inception in the 1920s, M-209 was Michigan's shortest highway. It connected the small community of Glen Haven to M-109 just south of the community. Glen Haven was founded as a settlement called Sleeping Bearville with a sawmill and an inn, the Sleeping Bear House, in 1857. By 1881, there were 11 buildings in the community. The lifesaving station was built in 1901 and moved to its present location in 1931 before closing in 1941. M-209 was first assumed as a state trunkline in the 1920s. It would later serve the national lakeshore when the park was created on October 21, 1970. The Park Service purchased all of the village by the mid-1970s. The highway was turned over to Leelanau County control on June 5, 1996. It is now known only as Glen Haven Road. Since the transfer, M-212 in Cheboygan County is now the shortest highway in the state.

The name comes from the Latin meaning for \\"the glory of the world\\". This could be a reference to the phrase \\"Sic transit gloria mundi\\", meaning \\"this is how the glory of the world passes\\". Career The members of Gloria Mundi included Eddie Maelov (real name Eddie Francis), their male vocalist, and Sunshine Patteson (now working as Sunshine Gray), their female vocalist and keyboard player, cc played tenor saxophone. A bassist known as Ice (real name Roland Oxland, a Dagenham native who had learned his craft in a band called 'Yours' (with Stevie Shears of Ultravox and Faith Global and John Clarke of Daddio Clarke and the Macon Wailers), played on the I Individual record. When he left to form a band with Stevie Shears, he was replaced later by bassist Nigel Ross Scott. The guitarist, known as 'Beethoven', was Pete Vas, who later had limited success as a solo artist on RCA. The drummer was Mike Nicholls. Following the departure of Pete Vas, guitarist Kirby (ex-Stretch), joined the band for a period and played on the second album The Word Is Out. Following Vas's solo venture, he then went into a musical collaboration with Alasdair Murray. Collectively they were known as Bete Noire and produced an unreleased EP called Langham Street in 1981. After Gloria Mundi disbanded, Eddie Maelov and Sunshine Patteson went on to produce music for Survival Records as Eddie and Sunshine. cc contributed a memorable saxophone solo to the Ultravox song \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\", and Nigel Ross Scott went on to play bass with Bruce Woolley and The Camera Club and achieved his first major success with Re-Flex, a 1980s new wave pop group. It was noted that the gothic punk band Bauhaus completely changed their music and presentation after gigging with, hearing and watching Gloria Mundi. It was also known at the time that early Ultravox and Gloria Mundi had previous connections between John Foxx and Eddie Maelov; Maelov being the principal writer as well as lead vocalist for Gloria Mundi. Generally thought by their fans to be way ahead of their time, Gloria Mundi's stage performance was regarded as revolutionary both in its visual imagery and underlying story-themes of isolation, individuality, sexuality, meaning and aggression.

First prototype of Dolby SR encoder / decoder, built by Ray Dolby on perfboard. The Dolby SR (Spectral Recording) noise reduction format was developed by Dolby Laboratories and has been in common use in professional audio since 1986 and in cinema audio since the late 1980s. It is a revised version of Dolby's earlier formats, combining aspects of Dolby A, B and C (e.g., sliding band and fixed band companders) to improve the dynamic range (i.e., the range in decibels between peak level and noise floor) of analogue recordings and transmissions by as much as 25 dB. Dolby SR is used in many modern professional audio analogue (i.e., tape) recordings by recording and postproduction engineers, broadcasters, and other audio professionals. It is used as the optical analog format on almost all 35mm film release prints, and is always the accompanying optical analog format when Dolby Digital is present. Dolby SR was originally implemented in Dolby's Cat.280 card, which was pin-compatible with the Cat.22 A-type noise reduction card. Thus, devices that took the Cat. 22 card could be upgraded from A to SR by replacing the Cat. 22 with the Cat. 280. The Cat.280 card functions in many devices including Dolby's Model 361 frame.

It was first settled over 100 years ago and has been used as a bacteriological station, quarantine station, a hospital to treat soldiers from WWI with venereal disease, mental hospital, a rehab for alcoholics, a women's jail, and now a sports and recreation centre. http://scratchingsydneyssurface.wordpress.com/tag/milson-island It is in the middle of the Hawkesbury River, so the only means of transport is by ferry. Some of the activities available at Milson Island include a high ropes course, rock climbing, canoeing, kayaking, archery, bushwalking and abseiling. The accommodation is 3-4 stars with seven lodges (Possum, Koala, Waratah, Kookaburra, Lorikeet, Platypus and Cockatoo) and five holiday units. The camp usually suits two small schools or a big school at the same time. It is a popular place for camps for many schools across Sydney, and families go there for a nice, relaxed and fun retreat. All that is left of the old mental asylum is the nurses' quarters or hospital. When the mental asylum was operating, an alarm system was set up, so that people on the island could keep themselves safe from mad escapees. The nurses' quarters are now rotted away, but the furnishings from the asylum still remain.

Diplomatic d√©marches are delivered to the appropriate official of the government or organization. D√©marches generally seek to persuade, inform, or gather information from a foreign government. Governments may also use a d√©marche to protest or object to actions by a foreign government. Informally, the word is sometimes used as a verb to describe making or receiving such correspondence. __TOC__ D√©marches by the United States The U.S. government defines d√©marche as \\"a request or intercession with a foreign official, e.g., a request for support of a policy, or a protest about the host government's policy or actions\\".\\"Protocol for the modern diplomat\\", Foreign Service Institute, U.S. Dept. of State The US government issues d√©marches to foreign governments through \\"front-channel cable\\" instructions from the United States Department of State.

A series of Rademacher distributed variables can be regarded as a simple symmetrical random walk where the step size is 1. Mathematical formulation The probability mass function of this distribution is : f(k) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} 1/2 & \\\\mbox {if }k=-1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1/2 & \\\\mbox {if }k=+1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\mbox {otherwise.}\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. In terms of the Dirac delta function, as : f( k ) = \\\\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } \\\\left( \\\\delta \\\\left( k - 1 \\\\right) + \\\\delta \\\\left( k + 1 \\\\right) \\\\right).  Van Zuijlen's bound  Van Zuijlen has proved the following result. Let Xi be a set of independent Rademacher distributed random variables. Then : \\\\Pr \\\\left( \\\\left \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{ i = 1 }^n X_i } { \\\\sqrt n } \\\\right \\\\le 1 \\\\right) \\\\ge 0.5. The bound is sharp and better than that which can be derived from the normal distribution (approximately Pr > 0.31). Bounds on sums Let {xi} be a set of random variables with a Rademacher distribution. Let {ai} be a sequence of real numbers. Then : \\\\Pr\\\\left( \\\\sum_i x_i a_i > t  a _2 \\\\right) \\\\le e^{ - \\\\frac{ t^2 }{ 2 } } where a2 is the Euclidean norm of the sequence {ai}, t > 0 is a real number and Pr(Z) is the probability of event Z. Let Y = Œ£ xiai and let Y be an almost surely convergent series in a Banach space. The for t > 0 and s ‚â• 1 we have : \\\\Pr\\\\left(  Y  > st \\\\right) \\\\le \\\\left[ \\\\frac{ 1 }{ c } \\\\Pr(  Y  > t ) \\\\right]^{ cs^2 } for some constant c. Let p be a positive real number.

For p ‚â• 1, c_2 \\\\le c_1 \\\\sqrt{ p }. See also: Concentration inequality - a summary of tail-bounds on random variables. Applications The Rademacher distribution has been used in bootstrapping. The Rademacher distribution can be used to show that normally distributed and uncorrelated does not imply independent. Random vectors with components sampled independently from the Rademacher distribution are useful for various stochastic approximations, for example: * The Hutchinson trace estimator, which can be used to efficiently approximate the trace of a matrix of which the elements are not directly accessible, but rather implicitly defined via matrix-vector products. * SPSA, a computationally cheap, derivative-free, stochastic gradient approximation, useful for numerical optimization. Rademacher random variables are used in the Symmetrization Inequality. Related distributions Bernoulli distribution: If X has a Rademacher distribution, then \\\\frac{X+1}{2} has a Bernoulli(1/2) distribution. * Laplace distribution: If X has a Rademacher distribution and Y ~ Exp(Œª), then XY ~ Laplace(0, 1/Œª).

His doctoral thesis, supervised by Sylv√®re Lotringer, examines the inherent instability of art objects, investigating what he terms \\"the thing that is not a thing\\" through an examination of events such as the 2004 Momart warehouse fire and the objects stolen and subsequently lost or destroyed by art thief St√©phane Breitwieser. Much of his current research focuses on ideas of this instability of the art object and the intersection between practice and theory, examining art as a method for understanding the object‚Äôs coming together through its undoing. Developing these themes, he is currently organizing a group exhibition that he is co-curating with Natasha Chuk entitled Solvent Forms.

The story features the return, and first redesign, of the Cybermen. It was the fifth incomplete Doctor Who serial to be released with full-length animated reconstructions of its two missing episodes. Plot The TARDIS makes a bumpy landing on the Moon in the year 2070; dressed in spacesuits, the Second Doctor and his companions Ben, Polly and Jamie venture outside to explore the low- gravity environment. While they play, Jamie is injured. Some workers from the nearby Moonbase find Jamie and bring him inside for treatment while the remaining TARDIS crew follows. The time travellers learn that the Moonbase uses a machine called the Graviton to track and manage weather on Earth. Their arrival is ill-timed, as members of the international crew, led by the bullish Hobson, have begun to collapse under the influence of an unknown pathogen. While International Space Control quarantines the Moonbase, the Doctor starts to investigate. Before he dies, the station's patient zero ‚Äì their staff doctor, Evans ‚Äì rants about a \\"silver hand\\". Another crew member, Ralph, then vanishes in the food stores, and the crew learn that their radio transmissions are being monitored from elsewhere on the Moon. Meanwhile, in the sickbay, a feverish Jamie begins to rant about a \\"Phantom Piper\\", a figure said to appear to a McCrimmon before death. While attending to Jamie, Polly sees a large figure leave through the door. When Hobson, the Doctor, Ben, John and Nils arrive to collect Evans' body, it has disappeared. They then leave to investigate where this 'piper' is. Polly goes to get water, and Jamie wakes up to see the 'piper' advancing on him. The redesigned Cybermen, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition The 'piper' ignores Jamie, as he doesn't have the disease, so he steals another patient and leaves. Polly comes back in just as the figure is leaving and recognises it as a Cyberman, and the Doctor realises their old enemies are taking the patients' bodies. Hobson brushes away the cyber-story, believing they died out years ago. He gives the Doctor 24 hours to discover the cause of the virus, or else he and his companions must leave. While Hobson deals with the Gravitron, which is becoming difficult to control with fewer staff, the Doctor focuses on the cause of the viral disease. In the sickbay, Polly and Jamie are attacked by a Cyberman, which stuns them with electricity from his hand and leaves with another patient's body. The Gravitron isn't working because some antennae on the Moon's surface are broken. Jules and Franz go out to fix them but are ambushed by two Cybermen and beaten to death. The Doctor can't work out the cause of the disease and is ordered to leave by Hobson. Polly makes some coffee and another crew member gets infected. The Doctor works out that the neurotropic virus has been spread through infected sugar from the food stores and is an organised scheme to destabilise the crew. A Cyberman who had been posing as a patient in bed reveals himself and aims his gun at them. Another Cyberman emerges and kills Bob when he tries to attack the other with a metal bar. The Cybermen recognise the Doctor and use their weapons to take control of the central control centre of the Moonbase while confining Polly and Ben to the sickbay. The Cybermen reveal that they want to use the Gravitron to destroy all life on Earth by altering the weather. On board the cyber-ship Evans, Jules and Ralph are conditioned to obey the Cybermen like zombie slaves. They are taken to the base and are sent into the heart of the Gravitron to subvert the machine. The Cybermen have been entering and leaving the base using a tunnel that goes into the food stores, explaining the drops in air pressure. Using fire extinguishers, nail varnish remover and other objects that dissolve plastic, Ben, Polly and a recovered Jamie lead a fightback from their incarceration in the medical wing. The three Cybermen in the initial attack force are destroyed. Benoit goes outside to see what happened to Jules and Franz. He only finds their spacesuits, and is chased by a Cyberman. Ben puts some of the solvent in a bottle and goes out. He then throws the bottle at the Cyberman's chest unit, killing it and saving Benoit. The crew block off the hole in the food stores to prevent more Cybermen entering. The cybership is located, but a large squad of Cybermen start advancing on the Moonbase. Two Cybermen on the surface damage the aerial, preventing the Moonbase from contacting Earth; however, a relief ship is on the way. The Cybermen use radio beams to reactivate their zombies inside the base, who infiltrate the Gravitron and use it to deflect the relief ship into the sun. A hole is blasted in the wall, which depressurises the base, but Hobson and Benoit use a coffee tray to plug the leak. The depressurisation deactivates Evans and the other zombies. Two more cyberships arrive. The Cybermen already on the surface erect a large laser cannon and threaten to blow the base open unless the entry port is opened within 10 seconds. They fire, but the beam is deflected by the Gravitron. Another large squad from one of the other cyberships take up positions around the base. With the help of Hobson, Polly and Benoit, the Doctor points the Gravitron at the lunar surface, which blasts the Cybermen and their ships into space. As Hobson and his team reorient the Gravitron to its proper use, the Doctor and his companions slip away. Back in the TARDIS, they dematerialise and then activate the rarely used time scanner to reveal a monstrous claw waving around. Production The working titles of this story were Cybermen and The Return of the Cybermen. It was commissioned before the last episode of The Tenth Planet was broadcast, to take advantage of the strong positive response to the Cybermen. When Pedler was commissioned to write a second Cyberman story, one of the requirements was that the story should have only one large set and a limited number of smaller sets. The first draft of the script was written before it was decided that Frazer Hines would be a regular cast member. As a result, the character of Jamie had to be worked into a script that didn't have much room for him. So in the first two episodes, Jamie spends much of the time in the sickbay. In the last two episodes, some of Ben's dialogue was given to him. The first three episodes were recorded on successive Saturdays at Doctor Who's then regular home of Riverside 1, but for Episode 4 it moved back to Lime Grove D. A final clip, used to carry the story into the subsequent adventure, The Macra Terror, was filmed separately during the making of that story, as the Macra prop was too large to be brought into the studio. This story is also the last story to use the original title sequence that had been in use since the first serial; the next serial introduced a new sequence with different howlaround patterns that incorporated Troughton's face. =Cast notes= This story features the debut of actor John Levene (uncredited) as a Cyberman. Levene would return as a Yeti in The Web of Fear (1968), and would go on to play the regular character Sergeant Benton. John Rolfe had previously appeared in The War Machines (1966) and would appear again in The Green Death (1973). Alan Rowe was cast as Doctor Evans, an early victim of the space plague and also provided the voice of Space Control. He later appeared in The Time Warrior (1974), Horror of Fang Rock (1977) and Full Circle (1980). Broadcast and reception Episode is missing Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial an unfavourable review in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), writing that it was \\"illogical and boring, reducing the Cybermen to the role of intergalactic gangsters\\". In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker noted that it was a remake of The Tenth Planet but was \\"far superior\\" in the way the Cybermen were portrayed. They also praised the music, acting, and the shots on the Moon, but they felt the direction was \\"lacklustre\\" in places and called the shots of the Cyberman ship landing \\"amongst the worst ever seen in Doctor Who\\". In 2009, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times also praised the redesigned Cybermen and the atmosphere. He wrote that the scripts \\"impart dollops of science without jarring and allow for a good deal of incident and suspense\\". AV Club's Christopher Bahn said \\"Whatever flaws it may have, and it‚Äôs far from perfect, ‚ÄúThe Moonbase‚Äù has more than enough going for it to earn a place as one of the must-see serials of the Second Doctor era.\\" In 2010, SFX named the resolution of patching the hole in the Moonbase with a drinks tray as one of the silliest moments in Doctor Who history. In a 2010 article, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger to the third episode ‚Äî in which the Cybermen march across the Moon's surface towards the base ‚Äî as one of the greatest cliffhangers in the history of Doctor Who. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial written by Gerry Davis was published by Target Books in February 1975 under the title Doctor Who and the Cybermen. Davis opens the book with a lengthy history of the Cybermen and updates Ben and Polly to readers from the 1970s. A Turkish translation was published in 1975. =Home media= In July 1992, episodes 2 and 4 of this story were released on VHS as part of the video Cybermen ‚Äì The Early Years. In November 2004, they were included in the Lost in Time DVD set, along with the audio tracks for episodes 1 and 3. As with all missing episodes, off-air recordings of the soundtrack exist due to contemporary fan efforts. In April 2001 these were released on CD, accompanied by linking narration from Frazer Hines. This serial was set to be released on DVD on 21 October 2013, with episodes 1 and 3 represented by new animation from Planet 55 Studios; however, production delays set back the release until 20 January 2014.

Agua Dulce is visible in the center of the image, just left of the freeway. Soledad Canyon is a long narrow canyon/valley located in Los Angeles County, California between the cities of Palmdale and Santa Clarita. It is a part of the Santa Clara River Valley, and extends from the top of Soledad Pass to the open plain of the Valley in Valencia. The upstream section of the Santa Clara River runs through it. Geography The canyon lies between the Sierra Pelona Mountains towards the northwest and the San Gabriel Mountains to the southeast, starting at the northeastern end of Santa Clarita Valley. Traveling northeast through the canyon, it gradually slopes up until the unincorporated community of Acton, near which the Santa Clara River continues east towards its headwaters among the San Gabriel Mountains. Turning north towards Palmdale, the canyon terminates at Soledad Pass, just a few miles south of Lake Palmdale. Soledad Canyon also contains the localities of Vincent, Acton, Ravenna, Russ, and Agua Dulce. History Soledad Canyon was a vital part of Los Angeles' transportation history. Transit between Los Angeles and the Central Valley was always difficult‚Äìin the \\"Gold Rush era\\" and stagecoach days the ride was extremely difficult, almost straight up-and-down through San Fernando Pass, up San Francisquito canyon, and over Tejon Pass. In 1856, Lieutenant Williamson, on a railroad surveying party, \\"discovered\\" that the pass, sometimes named \\"Williamson Pass\\", could provide the lower grades to make Los Angeles‚ÄìCentral Valley train travel possible by the roundabout detour all the way to Mojave, and over Tehachapi Pass, almost 70 miles farther than the direct Interstate 5 used today by trucks and autos. In the mid 1870s, the first rail line was laid down in Soledad Canyon. On September 5, 1876, then president of the Southern Pacific Railroad Charles Crocker drove a golden spike at Lang Southern Pacific Station to complete the San Joaquin Valley Line, the first rail line linking Los Angeles to San Francisco and the First Transcontinental Railroad. From 1921 to 1989, the Soledad Canyon Sand and Gravel Mining Project mined a downstream region of the canyon for sand and gravel. In 2000, the Bureau of Land Management awarded two 10-year leases to Transit Mixed Concrete (who later sold the contract to the Cemex Corporation) to mine the site. This resulted in a protracted legal battle between the Bureau of Land Management, the Cemex Corporation, and the City of Santa Clarita. In 2015, the Bureau of Land Management issued a cancellation of the contract, effectively ending almost century of mining within the canyon. Transportation Aerial view of the Santa Clara River as it winds through Soledad Canyon just east of Santa Clarita Soledad Canyon is traversed by the Soledad Canyon Road (the second- longest street in Santa Clarita), State Route 14 (the Antelope Valley Freeway), and the Metrolink Antelope Valley Line. Travelers on board the Antelope Valley Line are afforded a view of much of the Santa Clara River. Vincent Grade/Acton station serves communities within the canyon. The canyon was chosen as the state's preferred alternative for the route of the planned California High-Speed Rail line between Burbank Airport and Palmdale. Project maps outline five tunnels to be excavated through the mountainsides, crossing State Route 14 once on an elevated structure. Trains may start running in 2033. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the western reaches of the canyon north to south. Descending the southern slopes of the Sierra Pelona Mountains, the trail passes through Agua Dulce and Vazquez Rocks before winding up a mountain ridge. It then descends into the primary reach of Soledad Canyon, passing beneath the tracks of the Antelope Valley Line and crossing the Santa Clara River before continuing up into the San Gabriel Mountains.

Such forces typically consist of elite military units (special forces, paratroopers, marines, etc.) and are usually trained at a higher intensity than the rest of their country's military. They usually receive priority in equipment and training to prepare them for their mission. Quick Response Force (QRF) should not be confused with Rapid Deployment Forces (US) or Rapid Response (NATO). QRF units are most often units that react to local or regional issues within their area of jurisdiction, e.g. National Guard, militias, Forward Deployed, para-military forces, etc. Rapid deployment forces in most militaries are used for deployment outside of their country's borders. The US Army's 82nd Airborne Division and 75th Ranger Regiment are examples of Rapid Deployment Forces. Both units have the mission of having combat troops \\"Wheels Up\\" (en route by aircraft) within 18 hours of executive notification. Both units have the capability of \\"Forced Entry\\" into a territory to seize and secure key terrain, e.g. Drop Zone (DZ), airfield or airport, to accommodate follow up forces. A good example of this was the Operation Urgent Fury. The Rangers were at the staging base in Barbados in less than 18 hours from notification followed by the 82nd Airborne Division. The title of Rapid Deployment Forces is often associated with the US Marines. Members of the United States Marine Corps are stationed worldwide on ships, off the coasts of troubled regions and are already in place.

After initial success the revolt was ended by the invasion of the Teutonic Order. In 1346, the Duchy of Estonia was sold for 19,000 K√∂ln marks by the King of Denmark to the Teutonic Order. The shift of sovereignty from Denmark to the State of the Teutonic Order took place on November 1, 1346.  Background  With the conquest of √ñsel (Saaremaa) by the Livonian Order in 1261, Estonia was completely colonized by the Northern Crusaders from Germany and Denmark. The foreign rulers imposed taxes and duties even as the indigenous population retained individual rights, such as the right to bear arms. Oppression hardened as the foreign ruling class started to build manor-houses all over the country. The weight of duties to the lay masters was redoubled by religious repression of indigenous religion and economic exploitation imposed by the Catholic Church. The area was also politically unstable. The Estonian provinces of Harria (Harju) and Vironia (Viru) had been conquered by Denmark but by the 14th century the kingdom's power had weakened. The province in Estonia became split between a pro-Danish party led by bishop Olaf of Reval and the pro-German party led by captain Marquard Breide (no reference provided; split between 2 foreign powers - what happened to indigenous \\"party\\"?). 80% of the Danish vassals in the Duchy of Estonia were Germans from Westphalia, 18% were Danes and 2% Estonians  Beginning of the uprising  Padise Abbey. On Saint George's Night (April 23) 1343, a signal was given by setting fire to a house on a hilltop for a coordinated attack on the foreigners in Harria. The plan was to \\"kill all the Germans along with their wives and children. And so it happened, because they started to slay virgins, women, servants, maidservants, noblemen and commoners, young and old; all, who were of German blood, had to die.\\" Vahtre, Sulev (ed.). (1960). Bartholom√§us Hoeneke: Liivimaa noorem riimkroonika. p. 79. Tallinn: Eesti Riiklik Kirjastus. According to the Younger Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, after renouncing Christianity, the rebel forces crisscrossed the whole province of Harria, burned down all the manors of the nobility and killed all the Germans who fell in their hands. Among others, they burned down the Cistercian Padise Abbey and massacred the 28 monks who had failed to escape. The chronicle adds that any German women or children who were spared by the men were killed by the women who then proceeded to burn down all the churches and the huts of the monks. After the initial success, Estonians elected four kings amongst themselves. The kings along with the rebel army proceeded to Danish-held Reval (Tallinn) and laid siege on the city with 10,000 men. In the first battle under Tallinn the Estonians were victorious over the knights. However, the leaders of the rebellion were worried that once the Germans and Danes recovered from the initial shock, the Estonian government might not be able to withstand the combined onslaught of their enemies. Therefore, they sent a delegation to the Swedish bailiffs of √Öbo and Viborg and let them know that the Germans in Harria had been killed. They also told them that the Estonian army had laid siege on Reval, but they were willing to hand the Danish city over to the king of Sweden if the Swedes sent help. The bailiffs promised to raise an army and sail to Estonia.  Spread of the rebellion  A few days later, the Estonians in the province of Rotalia (L√§√§ne) renounced Christianity and killed all the Germans they could find. After the countryside was firmly in the Estonian hands, the rebel army laid siege on the city of Hapsal (Haapsalu), the capital of the Bishopric of √ñsel- Wiek. According to the Renner version of the Younger Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, 1800 Germans were killed in L√§√§nemaa.Vahtre, Sulev (ed.). (1960). Bartholom√§us Hoeneke: Liivimaa noorem riimkroonika. p. 79, 107. Tallinn: Eesti Riiklik Kirjastus. According to the Wartberge and Russow versions, the number of 1800 or 2000 killed Germans refers to either Harria or Harria and Vironia combined.Vahtre, Sulev (ed.). (1960). Bartholom√§us Hoeneke: Liivimaa noorem riimkroonika. p. 79, 107, 123. Tallinn: Eesti Riiklik Kirjastus.  Massacre of the four kings  Ruins of Paide Castle Soon after the massacre terrified survivors started to trickle to the castle of Weissenstein (Paide). The vogt of the castle immediately sent a letter to the master of the Livonian Order advising him on the situation. Burchard von Dreileben, the Livonian Master, sent one Brother to the Estonians \\"who knew their language and whom they knew\\" (possibly an ethnic Estonian member of the order) and asked them to send a delegation to Weissenstein to explain the reasons why they had renounced Christianity and killed all the Germans. He also promised to redress the past wrongs and establish good relations with the Estonians.Vahtre, Sulev (ed.). (1960). Bartholom√§us Hoeneke: Liivimaa noorem riimkroonika. p. 81. Tallinn: Eesti Riiklik Kirjastus. Estonians sent their four kings to Weissenstein accompanied by three squires. Estonians also let the bishop of Reval pass through rebel-held territory to attend the negotiations. Among the many high- ranking members of the Livonian Order who came to Paide were the Livonian Master Burchard von Dreileben, the komturs of Fellin (Viljandi) and Riga, the vogt of Jervia (J√§rva), and many others. The large number of knights who arrived to the negotiations indicates that the true purpose of the meeting was to neutralize the Estonian kings and then to attack the leaderless rebel army. Even after truce had been declared, knights of the Order attacked a camp of 500 Estonians in Ravila. On May 4, the two sides sat down for talks. The Livonian Master personally served as the spokesperson for the German side at the conference. The Estonian kings offered to become vassals to the Livonian Order, provided they would have no overlords over them. The master demanded to know why they had killed so many people, including the 28 monks of Padise. The answer he received was that any German deserved to be killed even if he were only two feet tall. The master of the order, Burchard von Dreileben, pronounced the answer outrageous, but declared that the four kings and their retinue were to remain unpunished and could keep their personal liberty; however, until the master has returned from the campaign against the Estonian army the kings were not to be allowed to leave the castle of Weissenstein. The four kings, who had been granted safe passage under the medieval code of honor, were outraged. They demanded to be released so that they could meet their fate with their army, but to no avail. When the Estonian delegation was escorted to their quarters they were suddenly attacked by their German hosts in the courtyard of the castle. In the ensuing fight the four kings and their squires were all hacked to death. The chronicle blames the incident on the envoys themselves, saying that one of them attempted to kill the vogt of Jervia (J√§rva) who had been assigned to attend to the Estonian envoys' needs. Some historians dismiss this explanation and say the negotiations were just a ruse to kill the leaders of the insurgency, and that the official version of the incident was a rather inept attempt to justify the murder of diplomatic envoys by the Teutonic knights.  End of the rebellion in continental Estonia  = Battle of Kanavere = A large army led by the Master of the Order proceeded immediately towards Reval, seeking out and engaging smaller Estonian units on the way. A larger Estonian force that had been sent to block the knights' advance was intercepted by the German cavalry. In the ensuing Battle of Kanavere on 11 May 1343, Estonians made a tactical retreat into the Kanavere bog. Since the knights were not able to employ their heavy cavalry in the bog, they dismounted and continued to fight on foot. The bog was not very large and the numerically superior forces of the Order were able to completely surround it. The battle ended with a German victory. Estonian losses in the battle amounted to 1,600 men. = Battle of Warhill = After the battle of Kanavere, Burchard von Dreileben, the Master of the Order, wanted to avoid engaging the main force of the Estonian army, strategically camped next to a large bog, in yet another battle where the heavy cavalry of the Order would lose its tactical superiority. Therefore, he decided to use deceit and sent the vogts of Wenden (Cesis) and Treyden (Turaida) under the pretext of peace negotiations to the Estonians, apparently agreeing to the idea of vassalage without landlords. Estonians accepted the offer and the envoys returned to the German army. Von Dreileben, in the meantime, had two banners of cavalry locate between the swamp and the Estonian camp. After the envoys had delivered the acceptance of terms to the Order, the Master and the knights agreed that the killed Germans need to be avenged and the Estonians deserved no mercy. On 14 May 1343, the Germans attacked and Estonians began their retreat towards the bog. Because of the advance troops of the German cavalry, they were not able to complete this maneuver and in the battle that followed 3,000 Estonians were killed. According to the chronicle, individual Estonians who had pretended to be dead in their desperation tried to kill Germans even after the end of the battle. The location of the battle became known as S√µjam√§e, or Warhill; it is now a subdistrict of Lasnam√§e, Tallinn. = Aftermath of the Battle of Warhill = The Master of the Order and the magistrates of Tallinn learned from a captured German deserter that the Estonians had been promised military assistance from Sweden that had recently conquered several Danish territories in Scandinavia. Swedish forces were expected to arrive in Estonia in five days. The subjects of the Danish king in Tallinn, severely weakened after the carnage in Harju and Viru, and fearful of the Swedish intentions, submitted Tallinn and other Danish dominions in Estonia under the protection of the Order. After being promised compensation the Master of the Order agreed to provide Reval and Wesenberg (Rakvere) with German garrisons. The bailiff of Viborg arrived with a large army on 18 May and the bailiff of √Öbo a day later. After discovering the Danish stronghold in the hands of the Order and the Estonian army utterly defeated, the Swedes satisfied themselves with looting around Reval before sailing back to Finland. The Estonians had also tried to find allies in Russia. Two envoys had been sent from Harria to Pskov to inform the Russians of the slaughter of the Germans in Harria and Vironia and the imminent demise of the Order. The envoys suggested that the Russians may want to loot the German dominions in southern Estonia. On 26 May 1343, the Bishopric of Dorpat (Tartu) suffered a belated intrusion by 5,000 Pskovians. However, since the rebellion in Estonia had already been largely crushed the Order was able to scramble enough troops and with some effort rout the marauding Russians, killing about 1,000 of them. In the meantime, the Master had led the main force of the Order to Rotalia in order to break the siege of Hapsal. The Estonians retreated from the city without battle, again taking refuge in the bogs. Soon the Livonian Order received more troops from the Teutonic Order in Prussia. In the beginning of the winter the Master of the Livonian Order returned with these reinforcements to Harria and quelled the remaining resistance. The last Estonian strongholds in Harria to fall were Varbola and Loone (Lohu). In the wake of the bloody suppression of the rebellion, Harria was described as a \\"barren and desolate land\\". The chronicler Bartholom√§us Hoeneke also tells a story about Estonians plotting to get inside the castle of Fellin by hiding armed warriors in bags of grain. The plot failed when one mother tipped off the Order commander in exchange for the life of her son. This possibly apocryphal account has inspired several writers. After losing Reval and Wesenberg to the Livonian Order in 1343, the severely weakened Denmark also lost Narva in 1345. Thereupon king Valdemar IV in 1346 sold the Duchy of Estonia to the Teutonic knights for 19,000 silver marks (4 tons of silver). Another 6,000 marks was paid to the Margrave of Brandenburg. Another consequence of Saint George's Night Uprising was the disappearance of the remnants of pre-Christian Estonian nobility in North- Estonia.  Rebellion in √ñsel  On 24 July 1344, one day before St. Jacob's Day, Oeselians in √ñsel (the islands of Saaremaa and Muhumaa) renounced Christianity, killed all the Germans, and drowned the priests in the sea. On the same day they assembled around the Castle of the Livonian Order in P√∂ide. The castle surrendered after an eight-day siege. The vogt of the castle along with his garrison of Livonian Knights, as well as all the other Germans in the castle, were promised free passage. Regardless, all the defenders of the castle were killed after they had come through the gates. Saaremaa and Muhumaa remained in Estonian hands until the winter. As soon as the sea between the islands and the continent was frozen, the Master of the Order with fresh reinforcements from Prussia crossed the sea and invaded Saaremaa. The German army looted and burned all the villages they came across and finally laid siege on Purtsa Fortress, one of the largest Estonian strongholds on the island. In the winter of 1344, one day before Shrove Tuesday, the knights penetrated the stronghold after tearing down one of the battlements. According to Wigand of Marburg, 2,000 people were killed in the fortress. Germans lost 500 killed. The Oeselian king Vesse was captured, tortured, and then executed. Nevertheless, Saaremaa remained free and staunchly anti-Christian as the German army was forced to cross back to the continent before the sea ice melted in the spring and the roads became impenetrable for the returning reinforcements from Prussia. In the winter of 1345 the Christian army returned to Saaremaa where it laid waste to the northern districts by looting and burning for eight days. Eventually Oeselians asked for peace. The two sides reached an agreement and the army of the Livonian Order left Saaremaa after the Oeselians had reluctantly agreed to giving hostages and tearing down the fortress of Maasilinna Castle. The rebellion in √ñsel had lasted for two years. With the conditional surrender of √ñsel Saint George's Night Uprising was finally over.  In literature  The Saint George's Night Uprising has inspired several historical novels by Estonian writers, such as Eduard Bornh√∂he's Tasuja (The Avenger). The Soviet Union tried to use the anniversary of the uprising in 1943 to pit Estonians against Germans. The uprising is also a popular subject for debate among Estonian historians and writers. Some, like Edgar V. Saks and the writer Uku Masing have argued on the basis of contemporary documents that, contrary to claims in the chronicles, the uprising was not a fight against Christianity but only against the Livonian Order and that the crimes attributed to the insurgents were actually committed by the Order. Some see it as a continuation of the struggle between the Order and the Holy See. Others dismiss such claims as biased and unhistorical.

The prominent Nashville hilltop site of what is now the Tennessee State Capitol was formerly occupied by the Holy Rosary Cathedral (no longer extant), the first Roman Catholic cathedral church in Nashville (with the Diocese of Nashville at that time once comprising the entire territory of the State of Tennessee). The State Capitol was designed by renowned Philadelphia architect William Strickland, who modeled it after a Greek Ionic temple. The prominent lantern structure located above the roof line of the Tennessee state capitol is a design based upon the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens that honors the Greek god Dionysus doing battle with Tyrrhenian pirates. The cornerstone of the Tennessee state capitol was itself laid on July 4, 1845 and the building was completed fourteen years later in 1859. View from the capitol ca. 1865 The American Society of Civil Engineers has listed the building as a civil engineering landmark in recognition of its innovative construction, which made unusually extensive use of stone and was an early example of the use of structural iron. Both the interior and exterior are built with limestone from a quarry about from the site. Some interior columns were built from single pieces of stone, requiring massive wooden derricks to hoist them into place. Wrought iron, instead of wood, was used for the roof trusses to reduce the building's vulnerability to fire.Tennessee State Capitol , History & Heritage of Civil Engineering, American Society of Civil Engineers website Commercial, convict, and slave labor were used in the project. Fifteen enslaved Black men worked on carving the Capitol's limestone cellar from 1845 to 1847; Nashville stonemason A.G. Payne was paid $18 a month for their labor. It is believed to be \\"the most significant project where the [Tennessee] state government rented slave labor.\\" Strickland died five years before the building's completion and was entombed in its northeast wall. His son, F. W. Strickland, supervised completion of the structure. William Strickland also designed the St. Mary's Cathedral (located along the base of the capitol hill), as well as Downtown Presbyterian church located just a few blocks away from the state capitol. Samuel Dold Morgan (1798‚Äì1880), chairman of the State Building Commission overseeing the construction of the Tennessee State Capitol, is entombed in the southeast corner near the south entrance.

With an interest in progressive education and a deep appreciation of her mentor, the sculptor Boris Blai, Tyler offered her estate with the expressed wish that, through Boris Blai, it would become an environment for the advancement of the fine arts, scholarly study in the arts and individual creativity. As founding dean of what was then known as the Stella Elkins Tyler School of Fine Arts, Blai instilled the school with a commitment to progressive education emphasizing the student's mastery of technique within the framework of a liberal arts curriculum. Blai insisted upon individual attention to each student's needs as the basis of successful teaching. During his 25-year tenure as dean, Blai shaped the school into one of the finest visual arts centers in the country, and his founding ideals still remain paramount to Tyler's educational philosophy. In 1960, Charles Le Clair succeeded Blai. Under Le Clair, the Tyler campus was improved with construction of a residence hall and two studio/classroom buildings. In 1966, the school's name was changed to the Tyler School of Art, and Le Clair founded the Tyler Study Abroad program in Rome, Italy. Tyler's programs at Temple University Rome remain among the most respected fine arts study abroad programs in Europe today. Temple University Rome has expanded to include a full range of liberal arts, architecture, business and law courses with an emphasis on those relating to Rome, Italy and Europe. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Tyler's curriculum continued to grow in response to new definitions of art-making and the role of art in society. New programs and modern facilities in design, ceramics, glass, metals and photography were added. During this time, Tyler established Art History and Art Education departments on Temple's Main Campus in Philadelphia. The pace of change and growth began to accelerate dramatically in the late 1990s. In 1998, Tyler opened Temple's Department of Architecture. In 2009, Tyler moved from Elkins Park into a new, 250,000-square-foot building at Temple's Main Campus. Three years later, Architecture moved into a new 50,000-square-foot facility connected to the new Tyler building. Temple's programs in landscape architecture, horticulture, city and regional planning, and community development became part of Tyler in 2016, for the first time unifying all of the architecture and environmental design disciplines at Temple in one academic unit. In 2017, TSusan E. Cahan, who came from Yale University became the first permanent dean of an independent Tyler since the school moved into its new building in 2009. On July 1, 2019, more than 20 years after Architecture at Temple became part of Tyler, the school's name officially became the Tyler School of Art and Architecture.

Notable writers including Ambrose Bierce, Benjamin Franklin, Walt Whitman, and Mark Twain served as printer's devils in their youth. Derivation The origin of printer's devil is not definitively known. Various competing theories of the phrase's origin follow. Printer's devil has been ascribed to parts of printer's apprentices' skin inevitably being stained black by the ink used in printing. As black was associated with the \\"black arts\\", the apprentice came to be called a devil. Another origin is linked to the fanciful belief among printers that a special devil (see the typographical personification Titivillus) haunted every print shop, performing mischief such as inverting type, misspelling words and removing entire lines of completed type. The apprentice became a substitute source of blame and came to be called a printer's devil by association. A third source involves a business partner of Johann Gutenberg, Johann Fust, who sold several of Gutenberg's bibles to King Louis XI of France and his court officials, representing the bibles as hand-copied manuscripts. When it was discovered that individual letters were identical in appearance, Fust was accused of witchcraft ‚Äì the red ink text was said to have been written in blood, and Fust was imprisoned. Though Fust was later freed after the bibles' origins were revealed, many still believed he was in league with Satan, thus the phrase. Another possible origin is ascribed to Aldus Manutius, a well-known Venetian printer of the Renaissance and founder of the Aldine Press, who was denounced by detractors for practicing the black arts (early printing was long associated with devilry). The assistant to Manutius was a young boy of African descent who was accused of being the embodiment of Satan and dubbed the printer's devil. One likely source stems from the fact that worn and broken lead type is thrown into a hellbox, which the printer's devil must take to the furnace for melting and recasting. English tradition links the origin of printer's devil to the assistant of the first English printer and book publisher, William Caxton. Caxton's assistant was named \\"Deville\\", which evolved to \\"devil\\" over time, as that name was used to describe other printers' apprentices. Famous devils A number of notable men served as printer's devils in their youth, including Ambrose Bierce, William Dean Howells, James Printer, Benjamin Franklin, Raymond C. Hoiles, Samuel Fuller, Thomas Jefferson, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Joel Chandler Harris, Warren Harding, Harry Burleigh, Lawrence Tibbett, John Kellogg, Lyndon Johnson, Hoodoo Brown, James Hogg, Geoff Lloyd, Joseph Lyons, Albert Parsons, Meade Huggins and L√°zaro C√°rdenas.

The basic manner of gameplay is similar as in the Konami's Beatmania series; however, as the franchise continues, it differs in style of music and gameplay. The first edition of EZ2DJ was introduced in 1999 and last version, EZ2DJ Azure Expression ~Integral Composition~ was released in June 2012. Afterwards, following the lawsuit against Konami, the rights for franchise were given to Square Pixels company, and development continued under the title of EZ2AC, with latest version being EZ2AC Final EX, which was released in August 2020. Audio System EZ2DJ cabinet features a total of 10 speakers. There are four mid-range speakers stacked vertically on either side of the screen, and two subwoofers located on the front of the machine. The cabinet also features a pair of headphone jacks, giving players the options to use their own headphones. Using headphones does not disable the external speakers. Effector Buttons EZ2DJ cabinet features four red effector buttons, located at the top of the controller part. However, unlike the Beatmania series, depending on the game mode, effector button are treated as a gameplay button, especially in the game mode \\"Radio Mix\\", where each player need to control 2 effector buttons. Essentially this is very similar to the 7 key mode of Beatmania IIDX, but due to the location of these effector button‚Äîlocated in a row right at center of the console panel, right underneath the screen and away from the keyboard‚Äîit makes it even more difficult than Beatmania IIDX in some occasion (especially since it also use the pedal). Also, another game mode named \\"Space Mix\\" uses all four buttons along with all keys and turn tables (excludes pedals), becoming the hardest gamemode in the game. Lawsuit and ruling On July 10, 2007 Konami won a patent infringement suit against AmuseWorld. Konami had originally filed a lawsuit against AmuseWorld in 2001 over the same issue which they settled out of court. It is believed that this settlement was due to the continued release of the title. Following the second trial, a Korean judge's ruling ordered AmuseWorld to pay Konami damages and stop production of the product completely. AmuseWorld paid 11.7 Billion won in satisfaction to Konami.

It is most useful against Tinea versicolor. It is sold under many brand names worldwide.Drugs.com International brand names for ciclopirox Page accessed January 201, 2016 Medical uses Ciclopirox is indicated for the treatment of tinea pedis and tinea corporis due to Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum, as well as seborrheic dermatitis. It is not to be used in the eyes or vagina, and nursing women should consult their doctors before use, since it is not known whether ciclopirox passes into human milk. A burning sensation may be felt when first applying ciclopirox on the skin. =Nail infections= In addition to other formulations, ciclopirox is used in lacquers for topical treatment of onychomycosis (fungal infections of the nails). A meta-analysis of the six trials of nail infections available in 2009 concluded that they provided evidence that topical ciclopirox had poor cure rates and that amorolfine might be substantially more effective, but more research was required. \\"Combining data from 2 trials of ciclopiroxolamine versus placebo found treatments failure rates of 61% and 64% for ciclopiroxolamine. These outcomes followed long treatment times (48 weeks) and this makes ciclopiroxolamine a poor choice for nail infections. Better results were observed with the use of amorolfine lacquer; 6% treatment failure rates were found after 1 month of treatment but these data were collected on a very small sample of people and these high rates of success might be unreliable.\\" Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= In contrast to the azoles and other antimycotic drugs, the mechanism of action of ciclopirox is poorly understood. However, loss of function of certain catalase and peroxidase enzymes has been implicated as the mechanism of action, as well as various other components of cellular metabolism. In a study conducted to further elucidate ciclopirox's mechanism, several Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants were screened and tested. Results from interpretation of the effects of both the drug treatment and mutation suggested that ciclopirox may exert its effect by disrupting DNA repair, cell division signals and structures (mitotic spindles) as well as some elements of intracellular transport. It is currently being investigated as an alternative treatment to ketoconazole for seborrhoeic dermatitis as it suppresses growth of the yeast Malassezia furfur. Initial results show similar efficacy to ketoconazole with a relative increase in subjective symptom relief due to its inherent anti-inflammatory properties. Chemistry Ciclopirox is a considered a hydroxypyrimidine (sic) antifungal agent. Structurally, ciclopirox is the N-oxide of a 2-hydroxypyridine derivative and therefore ought to be termed a hydroxypyridine antifungal agent. Additionally, the structure as drawn above is the lactam tautomer and indicates the molecule being an N-Hydroxy-2-pyridone. Hence the classification of ciclopirox as a 2-pyridone antifungal agent. Ciclopirox is used clinically as ciclopirox olamine, the olamine salt of ciclopirox.

He started his working life as an apprentice tool maker at Borehamwood near London England. Armin did time in the R.A.F. as a quartermaster (His rank was staff sergeant). He married Violet Burton from Waterloo. After the war Armin worked at various locations around the London areas, as manager of a furniture company based in Camden Town, London, and then as a market demonstrator. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, while still living in central London, he became father to four children, one of whom died soon after birth. He relocated in 1958 to Yorkshire to follow a new profession as a travelling salesman selling furniture polish, and then a few years later as an encyclopaedia salesman. In 1960 Armin moved to Nottingham, and moved back to London in 1965, where he worked as a civilian driver for the police and a guard for a security firm. In 1971 Armin's son John met up with a group of people who were staying in London after travelling around the world 'looking for something'. John suggested they would be interested in meeting his dad. They formed into a group under the Armins' leadership, and all met regularly over the next two years, primarily at Leo's council flat in Hackney. In 1972 the group began officially as 'The Emin Society' at which time Raymond Armin became known as 'Leo' and John as 'Orman' within the society. The society used many halls around the London areas, eventually occupying a small centre at Gospel Oak in London. Autumn of 1976 saw a relocation to a larger centre at Hotham Road, Putney, London..

South of Delmas, the R42 continues by way of a right turn, continuing south-west. =Gauteng= The R42 re-enters Gauteng Province and meets the R29 Road and N17 National Route on their route midway between Springs and Devon. The R42 continues south-west, bypassing the Marievale Bird Sanctuary and Nigel Dam as Nigel- Delmas Road, to Nigel. The journey from Delmas to Nigel is 43km. In Nigel, at the Balfour Road junction, the R42 cosigns with the R51 and R550 for a few kilometres westwards, forming the northern border of Nigel's CBD, up to the main four-way junction after the Glenverloch suburb. At this junction, as the R51 continues via a right turn and the R550 continues straight, the R42 continues via a left turn. The R42 goes a small distance (15km) south-west as Heidelberg-Nigel road, following the Blesbokspruit, to Heidelberg. Entering Heidelberg, as Jacobs Street, the R42 crosses the N3 Johannesburg-Durban Highway. At Louw Street, the R42 makes a right turn and a left turn at the next junction to become HF Verwoerd Street. It then intersects with the R23 Road and continues west-south-west, becoming the southern border of the Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve. At the junction with the R551, the R42 continues, via a left turn, west-south-west, bypassing Meyerton, to Vereeniging. The journey from Heidelberg to Vereeniging is 45km. Upon entering Vereeniging, north of the Three Rivers East suburb, the R42 meets the R54 Road from Vereeniging North & Potchefstroom. They are cosigned southwards up to the next junction. As the R54 continues south-east to Villiers, Free State, the R42 becomes the road west-south-west. It forms the main road through Three Rivers westwards as General Hertzog Road, separating the two sides of the Three Rivers suburb (Three Rivers North from Three Rivers South, as indicated on road signage). At Peacehaven, the R42 turns southwards, following the Vereeniging Railway, to reach a junction with the R82 Road. As the R82 enters Gauteng from the Free State (crossing the Vaal River from the east), they are co-signed westwards, crossing under the Vereeniging Railway, up to the 2nd junction (Voortrekker Street). As the R82 becomes Voortrekker Street northwards through Vereeniging Central, the R42 becomes the same road southwards. At the Lewis Street junction, Voortrekker Street (R42) becomes Barrage Road and turns west-south-west towards Vanderbijlpark. Near the suburb of Powerville, the R42 meets the R59 Sybrand van Niekerk Freeway (west southbound and east northbound off-ramps only). The R42 continues westwards as the main road through Vanderbijlpark, bypassing Sharpeville and passing the Vaal University of Technology. Just after Vaal Mall, the R42 meets the R57 Golden Highway at a major junction. From the R57 Golden Highway Junction, the R42 goes west for a further 15km, meeting the southern terminus of the R553 Road from Sebokeng. As the road continuing westwards joins the N1 Kroonvaal Toll Route southwards, the R42 Route makes a left turn to become Boundary Road southwards and continues for 15 kilometres, crossing the Vaal River into the Free State, crossing to the other side of the N1 Toll Highway, to end at another junction with the R59 Road east of the city of Parys, just west of the R59's intersection with the N1 Highway.

Life and career Laumann was born in Toronto Township, Ontario, now Mississauga. Starting in 1976, Laumann won a number of awards, including a gold medal in quadruple sculls at the U.S. Championships, two gold medals in single sculls at the Pan American Games, a bronze medal at the 1984 Olympics in the double sculls with her sister Daniele. At the 1988 Olympics, Laumann finished seventh in the double scull. Laumann graduated from the University of Western Ontario in 1989 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Laumann won a silver medal in single sculls at the 1990 World Championships, and the gold medal at the following year's World Championships. Arguably the most famous incident in Laumann's life was during her training leading up to the 1992 Summer Olympics. One of the odds-on favourites to capture a gold medal, her shell was involved in a collision with the boat of German coxless pair team Colin von Ettinghausen and Peter Hoeltzenbein on May 15, 1992. Despite serious injuries to her leg (in her words, \\"I looked at the leg for a few seconds and knew it was serious when my muscle was hanging at my ankle and I could see the bone\\"), five operations and a total stay in the hospital of approximately three weeks, Laumann was back on the water training by late June. Her efforts paid off with a bronze medal, and she was subsequently named Canadian of the Year by the Canadian Club in recognition and was selected to carry the Canadian Flag in the closing ceremonies of the Olympics. After a one-year absence to allow the injury to heal further, Laumann resumed competing in 1994, and she won a silver at the 1995 World Championships. She also won a gold medal as part of a quad sculls team at the 1995 Pan American Games, but was subsequently stripped of the medal after testing positive for pseudoephedrine (which she claimed to have accidentally ingested due to a mix-up in what cold medicine she could safely use). Pseudoephedrine's ban was lifted temporarily between 2004 and 2010 before being banned again. Her final competitive race was at the 1996 Summer Olympics, where Silken won a silver medal in single sculls. She formally announced her retirement three years later. Laumann was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1998 and was awarded the Thomas Keller Medal in 1999 for her outstanding international rowing career. In 2004, she was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. She now lives in Victoria, British Columbia and works as a public speaker.

He is one of the world's leading researchers on the development of purpose in life and the author of the influential book The Path to Purpose. Damon also helped develop innovative educational methods such as peer collaboration, project-based learning, and the youth charter. Damon is also known for his studies of purposeful philanthropy. His current work includes a scientific study that explores the development of purpose in higher education and a study of family purpose across generations. Dr. Damon writes on intellectual and social development through the lifespan. He is the founding editor of New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development and editor-in-chief of The Handbook of Child Psychology (1998 and 2006 editions). Damon has been elected to the National Academy of Education and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In January 2018, Damon was named one of \\"The 50 Most Influential Psychologists in the World\\".  Early life and education  Damon grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts and attended public schools there. His mother Helen was a shoe designer. His father Philip served in the army during World War II and did not return from the war. Damon moved in with his mother's uncle Louis Meyers, who helped raise him and sent him to college.Damon, W. (1996). Dear Caroline. In E. Goode (Ed.), Letters for our children (pp. 117-122). New York: Random House. After college, Damon received a doctorate in psychology at the University of California. He then joined the psychology faculty at Clark University as an assistant professor. In the 1990s he was University Professor at Brown, where he founded the Center for the Study of Human Development. In the 1990s Damon also did part-time work with television and film studios to develop educational content for shows such as Ghost Writer and The Big Bag.  Research and writing career  Damon is the author of 18 books and numerous book chapters and articles on education and human development. His work has been influential for research and theory in academic developmental psychology and in the broader society, especially around questions of childrearing and schooling that supports children‚Äôs social development. Damon‚Äôs editorship of the 5th and 6th editions of the Handbook of Child Psychology places him‚Äìalong with Carl Murchison, Leonard Carmichael, and Paul Mussen‚Äìas one of the great organizers and synthesizers of developmental science. As part of Damon‚Äôs commitment to the study of human growth, he also was the founder and long-term editor of the series New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development. By the time Damon captured the attention of the popular press with his book The Moral Child: Nurturing Children‚Äôs Natural Moral Growth (1990), he had written and edited seven scholarly books on the social and moral development of children. His early works include The Social World of the Child (1977), and Social and Personality Development: Infancy through Adolescence (1983). These studies focused on how the conduct of children and adolescents plays out in real social situations. Damon emphasized that thinking and behavior develop in dynamic relationship with family, peers, teachers, and the larger social world. Moral emotions (such as empathy, shame, and guilt) and the principles of distributive justice (which can be seen in sharing) flourish, or may be smothered, within these relationships. The Moral Child marked a shift in Damon‚Äôs scholarship. The book surveyed and synthesized the large, complex body of research on moral development and translated it for the general public. In addition to bringing him a new audience, the book articulated the implications of the best research for educational practice and childrearing and family relations. In 1995, Damon gained an even larger popular audience with his book, Greater Expectations: Overcoming the Culture of Indulgence in Our Homes and Schools (1995), which won the Parent‚Äôs Choice Book Award and was the subject of wide media coverage. The book proposed that prevailing child- rearing beliefs and practices are not leading to morally mature or competent young people. Damon argued that, ‚Äúwith best intentions,‚Äù parents and schools have been in large part responsible for this situation: our culture's unwavering focus on self-esteem and child-centered practices are misguided and reflect a misunderstanding of ‚Äúthe nature of children and their developmental needs. . . .All the commonly accepted standards for young people‚Äôs skills and behavior have fallen drastically. Less is expected of the young, and in turn less is received.‚Äù To build character and competence requires high standards and expectations. The book received praise from reviewers who agreed with Damon's emphasis on high standards for achievement and service. The book received criticism from some educators who believed that children need more attention and more creative freedom to grow rather than, as Damon wrote, the encouragement to take on hard challenges and to develop internal disciple and good habits. Another important focus in Damon‚Äôs work has been his study of moral exemplars. His first book on this subject, Some Do Care: Contemporary Lives of Moral Commitment (1992), written with developmental psychologist Anne Colby, opened up a new perspective on moral development and has been widely cited and built upon in the field. Damon and Colby studied individuals who had shown ‚Äúa sustained commitment to moral ideals or principles‚Äù over many decades of their lives. The authors found a number of qualities that were consistent across the entire group of exemplars, including a sense of certainty about their core moral beliefs, a positive attitude toward hardship and challenge, receptivity toward new ideas and goals, a lifelong capacity for moral growth, and a strong integration of their moral values into their sense of self. This book promoted the \\"moral identity\\" theory, which maintains that moral commitment and moral action are a function of how important morality is to a person's sense of self. This theory is distinct from theories that emphasize the primary importance of moral reasoning skills (Lawrence Kohlberg), emotions (Jonathan Haidt), or cultural background (Richard Shweder). This work also is known for its case study and interview methodology, which some believe to be more evocative than experimental studies. Damon and Colby followed up their Some Do Care study of living moral exemplars with some historical case studies of 20th century moral exemplars, described in their 2015 book The Power of Ideals. Damon's developmental research has been aimed at promoting \\"the character and competence of all young people growing up in today‚Äôs world . . . [to provide] guidance for parenting, for improved educational practice, and for youth development in a wide variety of community settings.‚Äù One study examined young people who exhibit a striking sense of purpose. This research has been expanded in the works of Dr. Kendall Cotton Bronk and Dr. Jenni Menon Mariano. In addition, Damon's youth purpose work is closely connected with the \\"positive youth development\\" approach pioneered by Peter L. Benson. In a series of studies with Howard Gardner and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Damon examined purposeful work in several professional and business settings. Damon wrote about journalism in the book Good Work and about business success in The Moral Advantage. Damon presented his framework for good work in philanthropy in Taking Philanthropy Seriously: Beyond Noble Intentions to Responsible Giving. Damon's book The Path to Purpose was the result of Damon's twenty- five-year research program on personal identity and character in human development. The book has been widely cited as the first scientific treatment of how young people find fulfilling purposes in life. The Path to Purpose presents Damon's vision of how schools and parents can help young people find elevated goals to dedicate themselves to, and it contains a critique of prevalent \\"short-horizons thinking\\" in today's culture that fosters cynicism and anxiety rather than inspiration, optimism, and faith.  Personal life  Damon is married to Anne Colby with three children, Jesse, Maria, and Caroline. He has a granddaughter Sarah, and a grandson Isak. Reviews Jonathan Yardley of the Washington Post called Damon's book Greater Expectations \\"A voice of common sense...forthwright, clearheaded and courageous.\\" The book won the Parent's Choice Book Award. Damon's book, The Path to Purpose: How Young People Find Their Calling in Life, has received widespread attention. The Library Journal wrote \\"This brilliant, involving investigation of the 'failure to launch' phenomenon is essential reading for anyone involved in educating, counseling, and directing today's youth.\\" Dawn Friedman of Greater Good magazine, Greater Good Science Center, said, \\"The book's important message is often lost in dense, academic language, but it still shines through real-world examples.\\" Parker J. Palmer wrote, \\"Every thoughtful adult I know is concerned that many American youth seem to lack a sense of purpose in their lives. Here is an important book that can help us move beyond concern to insight, public discourse, and action. In ‚ÄúThe Path to Purpose: Helping Our Children Find Their Calling in Life,‚Äù Bill Damon examines one of the most important personal and social issues of our time, and does so with a rare mix of sound data, compelling theory, practical recommendations and engaging prose. This is a must-read for parents, teachers, religious leaders, and anyone who cares about the fate of the rising generation.\\"  Books Damon, W., and Colby, A.

According to the QAPF diagram, granodiorite has a greater than 20% quartz by volume, and between 65% to 90% of the feldspar is plagioclase. A greater amount of plagioclase would designate the rock as tonalite. Granodiorite is felsic to intermediate in composition. It is the intrusive igneous equivalent of the extrusive igneous dacite. It contains a large amount of sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca) rich plagioclase, potassium feldspar, quartz, and minor amounts of muscovite mica as the lighter colored mineral components. Biotite and amphiboles often in the form of hornblende are more abundant in granodiorite than in granite, giving it a more distinct two- toned or overall darker appearance. Mica may be present in well-formed hexagonal crystals, and hornblende may appear as needle-like crystals. Minor amounts of oxide minerals such as magnetite, ilmenite, and ulv√∂spinel, as well as some sulfide minerals may also be present. Geology On average, the upper continental crust has the same composition as granodiorite. Granodiorite is a plutonic igneous rock, formed by intrusion of silica-rich magma, which cools in batholiths or stocks below the Earth's surface. It is usually only exposed at the surface after uplift and erosion have occurred. Etymology The name comes from two related rocks to which granodiorite is an intermediate: granite and diorite. The gran- root comes from the Latin grƒÅnum for \\"grain\\", an English language derivative. Diorite is named after the contrasting colors of the rock. Occurrence =United States= Plymouth Rock is a glacial erratic boulder of granodiorite. The Sierra Nevada mountains contain large sections of granodiorite. =Egypt= Granodiorite was quarried at Mons Claudianus in the Red Sea Governorate in eastern Egypt from the 1st century AD to the mid-3rd century AD. Much of the quarried stone was transported to Rome for use in major projects such as the Pantheon and Hadrian's Villa. Additionally, granodiorite was used for the Rosetta Stone. The extent of Egyptian granodiorite masonry is unclear. Egypt's 6000-year history makes determining the period of usage difficult as well. Perhaps like porphyry, it was ignored by the successive dynasties of Egypt and only heavily mined during Ptolemaic or Roman times. This is evidenced by the fact that most examples of granodiorite sculpture seem to have come from later dates. However, its presence in the Rosetta Stone implies that they had considerable experience with it and the fact that only newer artifacts are found may simply be because earlier pieces were lost.

His first work was non-fiction Vishva Di Nuhar on Albert Einstein's Relativity in dialogue form inspired by Plato's Republic. Published by the Punjabi University in 1966, the book initiated a series of university publications on popular science and sociology. Rode's first poetry book Surti influenced by science and philosophical explorations was experimental and in words of critic Dr. Attar Singh 'has extended the scope of Punjabi language and given a new turn to Punjabi poetry'. His most recent poetry book Leela, more than 1000 pages long and co-authored with Navtej Bharati, is counted among the outstanding Punjabi literary works of the twentieth century. Rode is regarded the founder of Punjabi theatre in Canada. He wrote and directed the first Punjabi play Dooja Passa dealing with racism faced by minorities. This was followed by his full-length play Komagata Maru based on a significant racial incident in British Columbia's history. Though it lacked professional direction the play generated considerable publicity inspiring theatrical interests in the Indian-Canadian community. His most recent English play Rebirth of Gandhi was produced at Surrey Arts Centre Canada) in 2004 to a full house. Among Rode's significant translation is The Last Flicker an English rendering of a modern Punjabi classic novel Marhi Da Diva by Gurdial Singh who recently won the Gyan Peeth, India's highest literary award. The translation was published by the Indian Academy of Letters in 1993. Currently Rode is member of an international team of translators rendering Sufi songs from Urdu, Punjabi and Hindi into English; the project based in Los Angeles aims to produce a large multilingual book of original and translated songs sung by late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the legendary Sufi singer of the twentieth century. An active member of the Writers' Union of Canada, Ajmer Rode was on its national council in 1994 and later chaired its Racial Minority Writers Committee; Currently he is co-ordinator of Vancouver's Punjabi Writers Forum, the oldest and influential Punjabi writers association in Canada.

Leonetto Cappiello (9 April 1875 ‚Äì 2 February 1942) was an Italian and French poster art designer and painter, who mainly lived and worked in Paris.\\"Cappiello (Leonetto).\\" Museum of Advertising (Musee de la Publicite). He is now often called 'the father of modern advertising' because of his innovation in poster design. The early advertising poster was characterized by a painterly quality as evidenced by early poster artists Jules Ch√©ret, Alfred Choubrac and Hugo D'Alesi. Cappiello, like other young artists, worked in a way that was almost the opposite of his predecessors. He was the first poster artist to use bold figures popping out of black backgrounds, a startling contrast to the posters early norm.National Gallery of Australia. \\"Maurin Quina.\\" Biography He was born in Livorno in Tuscany. He would die in Cannes in France. Cappiello had no formal training in art. The first exhibition of his work was in 1892, when a painting was displayed at the municipal museum in Florence. Some of his paintings are on display in the Museo Civico Giovanni Fattori in Livorno.Museo Civico Giovanni Fattori, short biography on Cappiello. Caricatures Cappiello started his career as a caricaturist illustrating in journals like Le Rire, Le Cri de Paris, Le Sourire, L'Assiette au Beurre, La Baionnette, Femina, and others. His first album of caricatures, \\"Lanterna Magica,\\" was made in 1896. In 1898, he moved to Paris, and his caricatures were published in Le Rire for the first time. In 1902, a 24-page book of his caricatures was published entitled Gens du Monde ‚Äòpeople of high society‚Äô for the magazine L‚ÄôAssiette au Beurre. The following year a 38-page book entitled Le Th√©√¢tre de Cappiello ‚Äòthe theatre of Cappiello‚Äô was published for a special issue of Le Th√©√¢tre magazine, this included captions written by theatre critics. Cappiello began to move away from caricature work favouring posters. In 1905 a final publication 70 Dessins de Cappiello ‚Äô70 drawings by Cappiello‚Äô by H. Floury, included black and white lithographic prints, as well as a handful of colour images produce by the process of pochoir. The technique was popular at the time as a way of adding colour to an image relatively cheaply, and would involve colour being hand painted onto an image with stencils. Cappiello made his name during the poster boom period in the early 20th century, with designs markedly different from premier poster artist Jules Ch√©ret.Jack Rennert. Cappiello, the posters of Leonetto Cappiello. . His first poster, for the newspaper Frou-Frou, was made in 1899. Cappiello's idea of himself. Vercasson Cappiello‚Äôs career as a poster artist began in earnest in 1900 when he began a contract with the printer Pierre Vercasson. In this period, the printers would act as an agent for artists and commission work to them. Vercasson had a print house, and his goal was to bring vibrancy and colour to the streets of Paris, he wanted the posters that he produced to stand out from the rest and attract lucrative new advertisers to his agency. Of course living in Paris, he was aware of the current art scene, and had seen many examples of Cappiello‚Äôs work, including a small number of posters already produced and in particular those for Le Frou- Frou. He knew that Cappiello had the potential to be exactly what he was looking for. The relationship commenced with the arrangement that Vercasson would find the clients and brief Cappiello on the product. It was then up to Cappiello to produce a sketch for the client for which he would receive the fee of 500 francs, a good amount at the time. Once the design had been approved by the client a full size design would be produced for the poster at a size of 1x1.4m, an old French paper standard known as the Double Grand Aigle. Cappiello would also be responsible for ensuring the successful transfer of the design onto lithographic stone ready for printing. He was married to Suzanne Meyer Cappiello in 1901 and his brother Oreste was married to Camille, sister of the painter Alfredo M√ºller. Between 1901 and 1914, he created several hundred posters in a style that revolutionised the art of poster design. Cappiello redesigned the fin-de-si√®cle pictures into images more relevant to the faster pace of the 20th century. During this period, Cappiello continued as a caricaturist. During World War I, Cappiello worked as an interpreter in Italy. Devambez After the First World War Cappiello returned to producing posters. His first meeting with Devambez in 1918 marked the start of a long discussion: three years later he signed an exclusive contract with the Paris publisher for whom he designed now famous icons: such as Kub, Campari, Parapluie Revel, Pirelli, Chocolat Klaus and Poudre de Luzy, and the famous entertainer Mistinguett at the Casino de Paris. Unlike Vercasson, Devambez did not have its own print house, and had the posters printed at a number of large printers. The agency concentrated on finding new clients from across Europe, and successfully spread Cappiello‚Äôs celebrated works across the continent. He remained with the agency until 1936. Legacy Over the course of his career Cappiello produced more than 530 advertising posters. Today, his original posters are still collected, sold at auction and by dealers around the world.

Originally developed by Sega AM2, the series moved to Amusement Vision with Virtua Striker 3. But the series moved to Sega Sports Design R&D; Dept. with Virtua Striker 4. The original Virtua Striker, released in 1994, was the first association football game to use 3D computer graphics, and was also notable for its early use of texture mapping, along with Sega's own racing video game Daytona USA. Only two games in the series have been released on home consoles - Virtua Striker 2 for the Sega Dreamcast, and Virtua Striker 2002 for the Nintendo GameCube. History The main arcade series includes: * Virtua Striker (1994) * Virtua Striker 2 (1997)  Virtua Striker 2 ver. '98 (update, 1998)  Virtua Striker 2 ver. '99 (update, 1998) * Virtua Striker 2 ver. '99.1 (update, 1998)  Virtua Striker 2 ver. 2000 (update, 1999) * Virtua Striker 2 ver. 2000.1 (Sega Dreamcast port; December 1999; named Virtua Striker 2 in US version) * Virtua Striker 3 (2001)''  Virtua Striker 2002 (2002) * Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002 (Nintendo GameCube port; February 2002; named Virtua Striker 2002 in US version) * Virtua Striker 4 (2004)  Virtua Striker 4 ver. 2006 (2006) The original Virtua Striker game received Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ports, distributed respectively through Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, in February 2013, exclusively for Japan. Overview The original Virtua Striker used Sega's Sega Model 2 hardware. The Virtua Striker 2 series run on Sega Model 3, with the exception of Virtua Striker 2 ver. 2000, which appeared on the Dreamcast-based NAOMI system. Virtua Striker 3 was released for the NAOMI 2; subsequent installments (Virtua Striker 2002 and Virtua Striker 4) used the GameCube-based Triforce hardware. Virtua Striker 4 added a card system and mobile phone syncing, allowing players to configure strategies and formations on the move. The game consists of a single-elimination knock-out tournament with 16 teams (like in the knock-out stage of the FIFA World Cup), with each match lasting two minutes by default, plus injury time and, if the match ends in a draw, one extra minute of sudden death. If the draw persists, penalty shootouts are used to decide the winner. In the console versions and Virtua Striker 4, matches are divided in two halves of one and a half minute each, with substitutions allowed at half time. Virtua Striker 4 also adds a qualifying match, which grants access to the tournament proper if won. The game operates with three buttons: one for passing (which is also used for sliding tackles when not in possession of the ball), one for long balls (which automatically crosses if the player is running parallel to the box) and one for shots, which can be charged or, if the player is on the receiving end of a cross, tapped for a header or volley finish. The Start button is used to alternate between each team's two available tactical schemes before and during a match (except for the first game, which had no such mechanic, as each team came with its own preset formation) - while each has an offensive or defensive mentality, the formation of choice before kick-off will influence in which formation the team will adopt a neutral mentality. Virtua Striker 4 also added a sprint button. The series has been ported to consoles on two occasions:Virtua Striker 2 for the Dreamcast (released in Japan and Europe as Virtua Striker 2 ver. 2000.1) and Virtua Striker 2002 for the GameCube (Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002 in Japan). Virtua Striker was also featured as a minigame in Sega's PlayStation 2 EyeToy-based game, Sega Superstars. The first three games of the series (counting also the Virtua Striker 2 revisions, but not the 2002 revision of Virtua Striker 3) feature a hidden team called FC Sega, made up of the game's developing staff, which always faces the player's team in special matches after the player wins the final match, and can be selected through a special cheat code. Virtua Striker 2 features two other hidden teams in addition to FC Sega: MVP Yukichan and MVP Royal Genki (exclusive to Version 2000.1), both of which consist of strange, cartoonish characters. The original team selection BGM from the first game also exists, and can be heard through a special code. In Virtua Striker 3 and the GameCube port, ver. 2002, there is an unlockable team called FC Sonic. This team is made up of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Dr. Eggman (who plays as the goalkeeper), four Neutral Chao, a Dark Chao, and a Hero Chao, and has Sonic's creator, Yuji Naka, as manager. Virtua Striker 4 released on the Triforce arcade platform in 2005, and was updated in 2006. It had online play with ALL.Net. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Virtua Striker on their July 15, 1995 issue as being both the second most-successful arcade game and the most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year. A critic for Next Generation applauded the original Virtua Striker as both \\"excellent to play and watch.\\" He cited the smooth and accurate control, realistic player moves, camera which consistently zooms in or out to the perfect frame at every moment of play, \\"gorgeous\\" texture-mapped players and backgrounds, and realistically strong defense.

A malicious user can create a symbolic link to a file not otherwise accessible to them. When the privileged program creates a file of the same name as the symbolic link, it actually creates the linked-to file instead, possibly inserting content desired by the malicious user (see example below), or even provided by the malicious user (as input to the program). It is called a \\"race\\" because in its typical manifestation, the program checks to see if a file by that name already exists; if it does not exist, the program then creates the file. An attacker must create the link in the interval between the check and when the file is created. A symlink race can happen with AV products that decide they will quarantine or delete a suspicious file, and then go ahead and do that. During the interval between decision and action, malicious software can replace the suspicious file with a system or AV file that the malicious software wants gone.https://www.zdnet.com/article/symlink-race-bugs-discovered- in-28-antivirus-products/ Example In this naive example, the Unix program \`foo\` is \`setuid\`. Its function is to retrieve information for the accounts specified by the user. For \\"efficiency\\", it sorts the requested accounts into a temporary file (\`/tmp/foo\` naturally) before making the queries. The directory \`/tmp\` is world-writable. Malicious user Mallory creates a symbolic link to the file \`/root/.rhosts\` named \`/tmp/foo\`. Then, Mallory invokes \`foo\` with \`user\` as the requested account. The program creates the (temporary) file \`/tmp/foo\` (really creating \`/root/.rhosts\`) and puts information about the requested account (e.g. \`user password\`) in it.

It is found in tropical and subtropical South America and the southern portion of Central America. Unlike the falcons in the same family, the caracara is not a fast-flying aerial hunter, but is rather sluggish and often obtains food by scavenging. Taxonomy When Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot first described the yellow-headed caracara in 1816, he gave it the scientific name Polyborus chimachima, putting it in the same genus as the crested caracaras. In 1824, German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix created the genus Milvago for this species and the closely related chimango caracara. Description The yellow-headed caracara is in length and weighs on average. Like many other birds of prey, the female is larger than the male, weighing against the male's . Apart from the difference in size, there is no significant sexual dimorphism in this species. It is broad-winged and long- tailed, somewhat resembling a small Buteo. The adult has a buff head, with a black streak behind the eye, and buff underparts. The upper plumage is brown with distinctive pale patches on the flight feathers of the wings, and the tail is barred cream and brown. The head and underparts of immature birds have dense brown mottling. The voice is a characteristic screamed '. Distribution and habitat This is a bird of savanna, swamps and forest edges. Resident from Costa Rica south through Trinidad and Tobago to northern Argentina (the provinces of Misiones, Chaco, Formosa, Corrientes and Santa Fe), it is typically found from sea level to , and occasionally to above mean sea level. In southern South America, it is replaced by a close relative, the chimango caracara, whose range overlaps with that of the yellow-headed caracara in southern Brazil, northern Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. A larger and stouter paleosubspecies, Milvago chimachima readei, occurred in Florida and possibly elsewhere some tens of thousand years ago, during the Late Pleistocene. According to the Peregrine Fund database, the yellow-headed caracara is expanding its range into Nicaragua. Behavior and ecology The yellow-headed caracara is omnivorous, and will eat reptiles, amphibians and other small animals as well as carrion. Birds are rarely if ever taken, and this species will not elicit warning calls from mixed-species feeding flocks that cross its path even in open cerrado habitat. It will also remove and eat ticks from cattle and Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) , and is sometimes called the tickbird. It has been observed also to forage for small invertebrates in the fur of brown-throated three-toed sloths and capybaras. In addition, at least younger birds are fond of certain fruits, such as those of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and pequi (Caryocar brasiliense). It lays from five to seven brown-marked buff eggs in a stick nest in a tree. The yellow-headed caracara has benefited from forest clearing for cattle ranching. Its status in Trinidad has changed from rare to fairly common, and it was first seen on Tobago in 1987. It adapts readily to urban areas and, together with species such as the American black vulture (Coragyps atratus), it is among the most commonly seen bird of prey in Latin American cities. Consequently, this wide-ranging species has been assigned a risk level of Least Concern category on the IUCN Red List. In Panama City for example, as a result of the increased urban sprawl, yellow-headed caracara pairs are frequently seen along the rooftops in suburban neighborhoods.

The ideas and practices associated with each > term, and with the three terms as a whole, are complex and vary considerably > in different contexts and historical periods. (2008:562) This Chinese name sanbao originally referred to the Taoist \\"Three Treasures\\" (from Tao Te Ching 67, tr. Waley 1958:225, \\"pity\\", \\"frugality\\", and \\"refusal to be 'foremost of all things under heaven' \\") and has subsequently also been used to refer to the Buddhist Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha). (This use is misleading, however, as the Three Jewels in Buddhism is a completely different philosophy. The Buddha is the teacher, the Dharma is the teaching, and the Sangha is the community. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the external supports for achieving realization, while the Three Treasures of Taoism are interior qualities or attitudes to be cultivated.) In long-established Chinese traditions, the \\"Three Treasures\\" are the essential energies sustaining human life: *Jing \\"nutritive essence, essence; refined, perfected; extract; spirit, sperm, seed\\" *Qi \\"vitality, energy, force; air, vapor; breath; spirit, vigor; attitude\\" *Shen \\"spirit; soul, mind; god, deity; supernatural being\\" This jing-qi-shen ordering is more commonly used than the variants qi-jing-shen and shen-qi-jing. In Neidan \\"internal alchemy\\" practice (Despeux 2008:563), transmuting the Three Treasures is expressed through the phrases lianjing huaqi \\"refining essence into breath\\", lianqi huashen \\"refining breath into spirit\\", and lianshen huanxu \\"refining spirit and reverting to Emptiness\\". Both Neidan and Neo-Confucianism (Despeux 2008:564-5) distinguish the three between xiantian \\"prior to heaven\\" and houtian \\"posterior to heaven\\", referring to Yuanjing \\"Original Essence\\", Yuanqi \\"Original Breath\\", and yuanshen \\"Original Spirit\\". The (2nd century BCE) Huainanzi refers to qi and shen with xing \\"form; shape; body\\". > The bodily form [xing] is the residence of life; the qi fills this life > while shen controls it.

Englehart 2000:99) The Taoist text Gaoshang yuhuang xinyin jing (, \\"Mind-Seal Scripture of the Exalted Jade Sovereign\\", or Xinyin jing \\"Mind-Seal Scripture\\") is a valuable early source about the Three Treasures (tr.

It is perhaps most noteworthy as the first drug control treaty to implement the similarity concept; that is, its provisions applied to all drugs with similar harmful effects and abuse liabilities as the drugs specified in article I, paragraph 2 of the 1931 treaty . The similarity concept was also included in the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The impetus for the treaty was the popularity of new, uncontrolled opiate derivatives that were outside the scope of the Permanent Central Board's restrictions. In particular, manufacturers were switching from morphine to pethidine, methadone, and other designer drugs to evade the international restrictions. The similarity concept was specifically designed to combat these tactics. In addition, every Party to the Protocol was committed to inform the UN Secretary-General of any drug used or capable of being used for medical or scientific purposes (and not falling within the scope of the 1931 Convention) which that party considered capable of abuse and of producing harmful effects. The Protocol also authorized the Commission on Narcotic Drugs to place such a drug under provisional control. The provisional control measures might be altered in the light of the conclusions and decisions of the World Health Organization (and subsequently in the light of experience). The Protocol was superseded by the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.

At present it is officially closed to the public and has no visitor services. The park encompasses sloughs, wet meadows, and an island between the Sacramento and Mokelumne Rivers. It is located near the historic Chinese American town of Locke, equidistant from Sacramento and Stockton. The property was established in 1985. Delta Meadows preserves a river delta much as it appeared 150 years ago, crowded with stands of oak, tule, walnut, willow, and cottonwood. Abundant wildlife includes black-tailed deer, beavers, river otters, muskrats, and wetland birds such as great blue herons, wood ducks, mallards, belted kingfishers, and cormorants. Delta Meadows is primarily accessible by boat. However one can drive onto Railroad Slough Levee from the River Road between Walnut Grove and Locke, via a small gravel road just north-east of the cross channel.

Indications and contraindications Devocalization is usually performed at the request of an animal owner (where the procedure is legally permitted). The procedure may be forcefully requested as a result of a court order. Owners or breeders generally request the procedure because of excessive animal vocalizations, complaining neighbors, or as an alternative to euthanasia due to a court order. Contraindications include negative reaction to anesthesia, infection, bleeding, and pain. There is also the possibility of the removed tissue growing back, or of scar tissue blocking the throat, both requiring further surgeries, though with the incisional technique, the risk of fibrosis is virtually eliminated. Effectiveness =Canine= The devocalization procedure does not take away a dog's ability to bark. Dogs will normally bark just as much as before the procedure. After the procedure the sound will be softer, typically about half as loud as before, or less, and it is not as sharp or piercing. So while the procedure does not stop barking or silence the animal completely, it is effective in reducing the sound level and sharpness of the dog's bark.Debarking Dogs: Bark Softening Surgery, April, 2013 Most devocalized dogs have a subdued \\"husky\\" bark, audible up to 20 metres.Code of practice for debarking of dogs, Bureau of Animal Welfare, Attwood, Victoria, Australia, October, 2001 Surgical procedure The procedure may be performed via the animal's mouth, with a portion of the vocal folds removed using a biopsy punch, cautery tool, scissor, or laser. The procedure may also be performed via an incision in the throat and through the larynx, which is a more invasive technique. All devocalization procedures require general anesthesia.Ventriculocordectomy (‚ÄúDebarking‚Äù), by Dawn Brown DVM, April 12, 2009, Mushing magazine Reasons for excessive vocalization Chronic, excessive vocalization may be due to improper socialization or training, stress, boredom, fear, or frustration.Cosmetic Surgery for Dogs and Cats , In Defense of Animals Up to 35% of dog owners report problems with barking, which can cause disputes and legal problems.Declawing and Debarking: What are the Alternatives?: World Small Animal Veterinary Association, World Congress ‚Äì Vancouver 2001 The behavior is more common among some breeds of dog, such as the Shetland Sheepdog, which are known as loud barkers, due to the nature of the environment in which the breed was developed. Less invasive interventions Vocalizations are a natural behavior of animals which they use widely in intra-specific and inter-specific communication. As such, devocalization should generally be considered only as a last resort. Before this surgical intervention, there are other, less invasive interventions which can be considered to overcome excessive vocalizations. =Training= Training can be one of the most effective techniques to help combat excessive barking in dogs. Acquiring the help of a professional dog trainer can often help reduce an animal's barking. =Corrective collars= The use of automatic and manual corrective collars can be useful as a training aid when used correctly; however, the use of corrective collars, particularly shock collars, is controversial and banned in some countries. Types of corrective collars include vibration, citronella spray, ultrasonic and electrostatic/shock collar. =Accommodation= Because dogs often bark excessively due to stress, boredom, or frustration, changing aspects of an animal's environment to make them more content is a suitable way to quiet them down, rather than forcibly silencing a distressed animal. Spending more time with an animal, such as playing, walking, and other bonding activities, will keep them occupied and make them feel more at ease. If the animal is stressed, it is best to remove the object that is causing them discomfort. Controversy and legislation =Reasons opposing=In some regions of the US and in the UK, convenience devocalization is considered a form of surgical mutilation.http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/hsvma/devocalization-fact- sheet-1.pdf *Most vets and the RSPCA offer information to behavioral schools on how to train dogs not to bark. =Reasons favoring=After surgery, dogs are allowed to bark more freely, which is a natural behavior. *The dog is no longer subject to constant disapproval for its barking. *Breeds and individual animals known for excessive barking/vocalizing have a higher chance of being adopted/rescued and not being repeatedly re-homed if/when training fails. *After debarking, dogs that previously had to be kept indoors to avoid antagonizing neighbors can be allowed outdoors. =Context= Dr. Kathy Gaughan points out that \\"the surgery stops the barking, but it doesn't address why the dog was barking in the first place.\\"Debarking surgery won't take away dog's motivation to bark, Understanding Animals Gaughan notes that visitors to her clinic who request debarking are usually looking for a \\"quick fix\\". Gaughan states that, commonly, those who seek debarking live in apartments, or have neighbors who complain. Gaughan also counts \\"breeders with many dogs\\" among those who most often seek convenience devocalization. However, Dr. Gaughan does not agree with those who claim the procedure is cruel, stating: \\"Recently, some animal advocates have asserted this surgery is cruel to the animal; some countries have even outlawed the procedure. I do not believe the surgical procedure is cruel; however, failing to address the underlying factors is inappropriate.\\" Some breeders seek the surgery in order to limit or diminish noise levels for personal reasons ranging from convenience to prevention; some breeders even seek the surgery for puppies prior to going to new homes. =Opinions of animal welfare societies= Multiple animal medicine and animal welfare organizations discourage the use of convenience devocalization, recommending that it only be used as a last resort. However, organizations such as the American Veterinary Medical Association, American Animal Hospital Association and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, oppose laws that would make devocalization illegal. The American Veterinary Medical Association's official position states that \\"canine devocalization should only be performed by qualified, licensed veterinarians as a final alternative after behavioral modification efforts to correct excessive vocalization have failed.\\" AVMA policy: Canine Devocalization (Approved by the AVMA Executive Board June 2002; reaffirmed April 2008; oversight: Animal Welfare Committee) The AVMA's position was later adopted by the American Animal Hospital Association.Canine Devocalization Position Statement , American Animal Hospital AssociationNew AAHA position statement opposes cosmetic ear cropping, tail docking The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association's position statement on devocalization of dogs states: ‚ÄúThe Canadian Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA) discourages ‚Äúdevocalization‚Äù of dogs unless it is the only alternative to euthanasia, and humane treatment and management methods have failed.\\" The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) recommends that animal caretakers first attempt to address animal behavior problems with humane behavior modification techniques and/or with a treatment protocol set up by an animal behavior specialist. The ASPCA recommends surgery only if behavior modification techniques have failed, and the animal is at risk of losing its home or its life.Position Statement on Surgical Procedures for Resolving Behavior Problems, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals =Legal restriction and banning= The legality of convenience devocalization varies by jurisdiction. The procedure is outlawed as a form of mutilation in the United Kingdom and all countries that have signed the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals. In the United States, devocalization is illegal in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Warwick, Rhode Island. United Kingdom Debarking is specifically prohibited in the UK, along with ear cropping, tail docking, and declawing of cats. By law, convenience devocalization is considered a form of surgical mutilation. United States In the United States, laws vary by state. In 2000, anti-debarking legislation was proposed in California, New Jersey, and Ohio. The California and New Jersey bills failed, partially due to opposition from groups who predicted the ban would lead to similar bans on ear cropping and other controversial cosmetic surgical procedures on dogs. The Ohio bill survived, and was signed into law by Governor Robert Taft in August 2000.Animal control is people control , Animal People News, May 2002 However, Ohio Revised Code 955.22 only outlawed debarking of dogs considered \\"vicious\\".Confining, restraining, debarking dogs., Ohio Revised Code In February 2009, 15-year-old Jordan Star of Needham, Massachusetts, filed a bill to outlaw performing convenience devocalization procedures upon cats and dogs.\\"Teen Files Bill to Make Vocal Surgery Illegal: Putting a Bite into Debarking\\", Boston Herald.

Infant beds are a historically recent development intended to contain a child capable of standing. The cage- like design of infant beds restricts the child to the bed. Between one and two years of age, children are able to climb out and are moved to a toddler bed to prevent an injurious fall while escaping the bed. Infant beds are more common in Western countries, employed by the majority of parents as an alternative to sharing a bed (co-sleeping).  History  Dutch painting of a baby in a crib The name \\"crib\\" was used to describe a slatted, high-sided child's bed. It derives from the Old English word \\"cribb\\" which means \\"manger\\" (food trough, referring to the shape of a bassinette) or stall (implying coralling the child). It wasn't until the 19th century that infant beds developed from bassinettes, acquiring a role of keeping the child in their bed. The development of a distinction between infant beds and bassinettes was natural because it was \\"considered vital that the child's bed be raised off the ground.\\" This was due to a perception of noxious fumes below knee level, and explosive vapours near the ceiling, with good air in between. Once children's beds were raised off the ground the role of the sides changed from a convenience to a safety feature. It was recognised that once children learn to stand they may be able to get out of a bed with low sides. According to an expert of the time, infant beds were used once the child was 12 months old. Often one side was hinged to open the enclosure, a function fulfilled in modern infant beds with a dropside. With the hinge side lowered, the bed could be moved on casters, and they could be moved right up to the carer's bed when needed. Iron beds were developed in 17th century Italy to address concerns about bed bug infestation and moths. This new application was quickly extended to children's beds - a rockable iron bassinette (with spear-like corner posts) has been dated to 1620‚Äì1640. Proponents promoted the supposed health benefits of iron beds. Infant beds constructed from metal became popular during the later half of the 19th century. Infant beds (and bassinettes) constructed from iron with mesh or chain sides were common. Childcare experts gave iron beds their approval because it was hygienic material (compared with wood) and could not \\"habour vermin\\", of which bed bug infestation, lice and moths were cited concerns. Commonly painted with a white vitreous enamel, later manufacturers working with wood continued to paint in the now traditional white; unfortunately this was often lead paint, and children were notorious for chewing and sucking the sweet surface. Since 1938, babies in Finland have slept in cardboard boxes with a mattress in the bottom, which are distributed to expectant mothers as a \\"maternity package\\" containing baby supplies.  Design  Standards specify acceptable and hazardous gaps in infant beds = Standards = As an example of improving safety of infant bed designs, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has set standards for infant beds sold since 1973. Since this time U.S. annual deaths attributed to infant beds reducing from approximately 200 to approximately 50, and injury rates now at approximately 8,000 per year. Many of these injuries are attributed to the 25 million infant beds manufactured prior to the progressively refined safety standards, yet still in use. Infant beds are designed to restrict the baby to the bed. The sides are too high for a baby to climb and provide no footholds. Technical standards for infant beds include considerations such as the materials used and preventing hand and head entrapment. Standards for infant beds have been specified in Australia and New Zealand, Europe, the United States and internationally. Design standards all identify and address four broad hazards: ; Falls: To prevent injuries such as concussion and bone fractures from falls when trying to climb out, footholds are not permitted. Minimum cot side heights are defined for various mattress positions. ; Strangulation: Infants can become trapped and strangled if their clothing gets caught on parts of a cot that stick out, or if their head becomes trapped between gaps. Neither gaps large enough for a child's head nor protrusions are permitted. ; Suffocation: Babies lack the motor skills or strength to turn their heads should they roll into something that obstructs their breathing. They can become trapped and suffocate if they fall into gaps created by ill- fitting or additional mattresses. Babies can also suffocate if the mattress is too soft. ; Entrapment: Infants can suffer injuries to their arms and legs if they become trapped between gaps. Gaps small enough for a limb to become trapped are not permitted. Some older cribs contained a drop gate (or drop side), a side which lowers to ease the process of putting the child into the bed, but can be raised again to restore the integrity of the enclosure. However, assembly problems and malfunctioning hardware on drop gates can cause the formation of gaps, which have been attributed to infant deaths and other major injuries. In June 2011, the United States implemented new safety standards requiring all infant beds manufactured and sold in the country to have fixed sides. In June 2016, Canada implemented a similar ban on the sale, importation, or distribution of any infant bed containing drop sides effective December 29, 2016. = Variations = Infant beds can be stationary or portable (portacots, portacribs or folding infant beds). In their portable form the beds generally don't feature a dropside, and portability factors are emphasised. Portacots are often made from plastics, are often smaller and fold into a compact package. Rather than bars, they will have breathable mesh sides with an aperture too small for any finger to fit into (less than 5mm by the standards). Standards for folding infant beds exist for Australia and New Zealand, Europe and international (adopted by various organisations including the American National Standards Institute). Convertible cribs or convertible cots that can be converted into a standard sized bed as the child grows larger have become increasingly popular due to a longer useful life for the furniture. By removing both sides it becomes a toddler bed with unusually high head and foot boards, or removing just one side it becomes a daybed. Although in the U.S. there is a standard size for an infant bed (~71 cm x ~133 cm), 12% of the 2.4 million infant beds sold annually are not of this size; \\"mini cribs\\" are an example of this. The \\"mini crib\\" is an umbrella term that covers all cots smaller than the standard size. It means that travel cribs and many play yards can also be called mini cribs. This said, people often use the term for small baby beds with hard sides. Larger infant beds are manufactured, generally for hospital use or for those with special needs. They may include a top, generally made of plastic or metal, to prevent a child from climbing out. Use An infant bed is typically used after it is no longer safe to leave the baby in a bassinet. They have a lower center of gravity, more mass, a broader base of support and can hold a larger baby than a bassinet. Infant beds are more stable than bassinets and as such become desirable when a baby can roll, transferring inertia with their actions; a bassinet may tip, an infant bed won't without concerted effort. Around two or three years of age children are able to defeat their confinement and should be moved to a toddler bed to prevent an injurious fall while escaping their bed (falls account for 66% of emergency room admissions due to infant beds in the United States.). A baby lying on an elevated mattress in an infant bed with traditional crib bumpers Placing a child into an infant bed can put strain on a caretaker's back as they typically have a mass between and at 36 months of age. To reduce the strain on those operating an infant bed, many infant beds feature: *a mattress that can be in a raised position until the child is able to sit upright, and potentially lowered further when they are likely to begin standing (between 8 and 12 months). *casters to make it easier to move the bed around. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants under 12 months share a room (but not a bed) with their parents, as this has shown to be protective against sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Other sleep environment factors include supine positioning (back sleeping), use of a firm sleep surface, breastfeeding, consideration of a pacifier (dummy), and avoidance of soft bedding, overheating, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Accessories A wooden cradle from India Scientific research has shown that the mattress influences SIDS outcomes; a firm, clean and well-fitting mattress lowers SIDS risk. However, neither mattress materials nor using a second-hand mattress affect SIDS risk. It is common to place a waterproof membrane between the mattress and the bedding to prevent uncontained bed wetting from damaging the mattress. Bed sheets ought to fit the mattress tightly so that the child cannot become entangled and suffocate; a common safety recommendation is to short sheet the bed. Because of the pronounced risk of suffocation in very young children, and the danger of a fall from the bed for other children, the addition of anything other than sheets (including quilts, pillows and stuffed toys) into an infant bed is not recommended by health authorities. A sleepsack can be used instead to keep the baby warm. Older children can use items such as pillows and toys to construct a platform to facilitate escape, defeating the major design criteria and endangering the child. An infant bed with raised mattress, mobile and now-discouraged traditional crib bumpers Bumpers (cushioning) are marketed to keep children from bumping against the hard sides and hurting themselves or becoming entrapped between the crib slats. A number of instances of SIDS have involved crib bumpers, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against their use. Nevertheless the public remain ill- informed of their potential for harm, and they remain popular. Some toys are specifically intended for an infant bed. Mobiles are musical toys to soothe the baby to sleep, but should be removed before the child can stand (8 to 12 months of age). Mirrors are to keep the children entertained while awake in the bed. With decreasing technology prices and increasing house sizes, it has become increasingly common to have a baby monitor nearby so as to alert the caretaker when the child awakens. Without either professional endorsement or scientific evidence that they prevent SIDS, apnea monitors are available to alert the caregiver if the baby stops breathing. Breathable mattresses are now being recommended to provide safer infant sleep. In the event an infant rolls over on their stomach they have a much better ability to breathe with a breathable mattress, compared to a closed surface mattress.

He accompanied Edward John Eyre to Adelaide by sea in May 1840, and would have left with Eyre on his expedition to penetrate to the interior in June of the same year, but Wylie was ill. Later in the year, Eyre was at Fowlers Bay in the west, having retreated from the north, and Wylie joined him by way of the ship supplying the expedition, the Hero. Wylie was subsequently one of the three aborigines to accompany Eyre and John Baxter on their final attempt to cross the Nullarbor Plain in 1841. He deserted for a brief time with the other older aboriginal boy, Joey, while the party rested at the sandhills of present-day Eucla, but they returned when they failed to find any food. Several weeks later he proved loyal to Eyre when Joey and Yarry (the other aboriginal boy) murdered Baxter and deserted. Despite the two aborigines accosting them and calling for Wylie to join them the following day, Wylie stayed with Eyre for the rest of the journey, impressing the French whalers they met in Rossiter Bay with his voracious appetite. Joey and Yarry had been taken on by Eyre at Gundagai and Yarry have been the same person as Yarri or Yarree, who saved a large number of Gundagai citizens during the flood of 25 June 1852 and was accused of at least one subsequent murder. After the completion of the journey, Wylie remained at Albany. He spent a brief time as a native policeman, and also benefited from a government pension procured for him by Eyre, who remained in contact with him for some years afterward.

History Present-day Woodlawn was settled by a group of farming families who entered the area in 1815, just as it was opened to settlement by the Treaty of Fort Jackson. The community took its name from the Wood family, headed by Obadiah Wood (1753-1849) and his son Edmond Wood (1791-1865), from Greenville, South Carolina. The site they chose was a well-watered section of Jones Valley along the Georgia Road which extended deep into what was then still part of the Mississippi Territory. Edmund was granted 1200 acres (5 km¬≤) of Obadiah's holdings on which to raise his family. It was on that property that the town of Rockville was formed in 1832 - a small cluster of houses near the roadside. The first railway came through the valley in 1870, at which point the settlement was renamed Wood Station and began to grow. By the end of that decade a private \\"Woodlawn Academy\\" had been founded to educate the children of the communities 89 residents. In 1884 the Georgia Pacific Railway began offering service into the rapidly growing city of Birmingham, about 4 miles to the west. In 1891 the State of Alabama granted a municipal corporation to the \\"City of Woodlawn,\\" the name chosen by its first citizens to honor the Wood family, who remained active in civic affairs. In 1895 the first City Hall and Jail were built and by the end of the century the population was 2,500. A second, larger City Hall was built at the turn of the century, along with schools, churches, a fire station, and library. The grand gothic-inspired Woodlawn High School opened in 1922. In 1910 the City of Woodlawn was annexed into Birmingham, but maintained a strong community spirit that was bound up with the Wood family, who had turned their estate into a public park (now \\"Willow Wood Park\\"), complete with spring-fed swimming pool. Commentators through the first half of the 20th century never tired of remarking on the local pride found in Woodlawn - \\"a really great section of Birmingham...A section typical of the fine things in life.\\" (according to one newspaper story from 1950) Unfortunately, this pride did not prevent the spread of urban blight following the social turmoil of the 1960s and economic turmoil of the 1970s. Compounding the growing problems of aging housing stock and \\"white flight\\" was a crisis of joblessness and poverty that took hold in the community. The need to seriously address these problems was evident by the beginning of the 1980s and some efforts at revitalization were attempted. Demographics Woodlawn appeared on the 1890 and 1900 U.S. Censuses as an incorporated town. It was formally annexed into the City of Birmingham in 1910. Current status Within the city of Birmingham, greater Woodlawn is characterized as one of 23 \\"Communities\\" that participate in the \\"Community Participation Program\\" that was drawn up to encourage local political activism and community development. The neighborhoods that make up the Woodlawn community are East Avondale, Oak Ridge Park, South Woodlawn, and the Woodlawn neighborhood itself. In the last few years, residents of Woodlawn have worked with the City and Region 2020 to create a master plan as part of Birmingham's \\"Comprehensive Master Plan\\" process. An initial project to implement master plan goals in the central residential section of Woodlawn, north of 1st Avenue, has met with limited success. Several dilapidated houses were improved and an active community garden was started. The business district of Woodlawn, and Woodlawn High School, both critical assets, remain at risk of not recovering from decline. Recently, attention has turned back to the business district of Woodlawn. Rev Birmingham and the Woodlawn Foundation have taken center stage revitalizing businesses and housing, making this the new hot neighborhood in Birmingham. Recently opened high end boutique businesses such as Open Shop, Public Office & Club Duquette, along with Bayles Catering, Historic Event Venue WOODROW HALL, the Cycle Caf√© and the artisan tea shop Piper and Leaf are calling this neighborhood home. All of this growth, combined with three new public murals is making Woodlawn the Magazine Street of Birmingham. Woodlawn is currently home to one of two Hackerspaces in Alabama. Red Mountain Makers.

The Palazzo della Cancelleria (Palace of the Chancellery, referring to the former Apostolic Chancery of the Pope) is a Renaissance palace in Rome, Italy, situated between the present Corso Vittorio Emanuele II and the Campo de' Fiori, in the rione of Parione. It was built 1489‚Äì1513 by Baccio Pontelli and Antonio da Sangallo the ElderFROMMEL, Christop. Architettura del Rinascimento Italiano. Milano, Skyra, 2009, p. 150-154' as a palace for Cardinal Raffaele Riario, Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, and is regarded as the earliest Renaissance palace in Rome. The Palazzo houses the Papal Chancellery, is an extraterritorial property of the Holy See, and is designated as a World Heritage Site.Historic Centre of Rome, the Properties of the Holy See in that City Enjoying Extraterritorial Rights and San Paolo Fuori le Mura (accessed: 2011-07-22) History The Cancelleria was built for Cardinal Raffaele Riario who held the post of Cardinal Camerlengo to his powerful uncle, Pope Sixtus IV. The rumor was that the funds came from a single night's winnings at gaming. In 1517, the newly completed Palazzo was seized by the first Medici Pope, Leo X, who had not forgotten the complacency of Pope Sixtus IV at the time of the murderous Pazzi conspiracy intended to replace the Medici in Florence, Italy with a Della Rovere regime. From 1753 the vice chancellor was the Jacobite pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Henry Stuart, Cardinal Duke of York, the Jacobite Henry IX of England and Ireland, and I of Scotland. During the late 17th century former Queen Kristina of Sweden resided here. During the Roman Republic of 1849 the parliament briefly sat here. In 2015, it was the residence of retired, and now deceased, Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, United States. Architecture Palazzo della Cancelleria: the 18th-century engraving by Giuseppe Vasi exaggerates the depth of the Piazza della Cancelleria in front of the Palace. The Palazzo della Cancelleria was the first palazzo in Rome to be erected from the ground up in the new Renaissance style. Its long facade engulfs the small Basilica di San Lorenzo in Damaso, the Cardinal's titular church, that is to its right, with the palatial front continuing straight across it. The entrance to the Basilica is on the right side of the facade. The 5th-century basilica (its interior has been rebuilt) sits, like the Basilica di San Clemente among others, on a pagan Roman mithraeum. Excavations beneath the cortile from 1988 to 1991 revealed the 4th- and 5th- century foundations of the grand Basilica di San Lorenzo in Damaso, founded by Pope St. Damasus I, and one of the most important early churches of Rome. A cemetery in use from the 8th century until shortly before the construction of the Palazzo was also identified. The facade, with its rhythm of flat doubled pilasters between the arch-headed windows, is Florentine in conception, comparable to Leone Battista Alberti's Palazzo Rucellai. The overall pattern of drafted masonry, cut with smooth surfaces and grooves around the edges, is ancient Roman in origin. The grand portal was added in the 16th century by Domenico Fontana on the orders of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. The bone- colored travertine of the Palazzo was spolia from the nearby ancient ruins of the Theatre of Pompey, for Rome was a field of ruins, built for a city of over one million that then housed a mere 30,000. The 44 Egyptian granite columns of the inner courtyard are from the porticoes of the theatre's upper covered seating, however they were originally taken from the theatre to build the old Basilica di San Lorenzo in Damaso. It is more probable that the form of the courtyard is derived from that of the Palazzo Ducale in Urbino, because the individuals involved in the early planning of the Palazzo had come from Urbino. The courtyard with the original columns from the Theatre of Pompey. In the Palazzo is a vast mural that Giorgio Vasari completed in a mere 100 days, therefore named the Sala dei Cento Giorni. He boasted of this accomplishment to Michelangelo, who responded \\"Si vede\\" (\\"It shows\\"). In the Palazzo a little, private theatre was installed by Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, and in the later 17th century the Palazzo became a center of musical performance in Rome.

Moroccan culture is primarily Muslim, Jewish , Christianity. and it represents a confluence of influences: Amazigh, Arab, Sahrawi, Sub-Saharan African, Mediterranean, Andalusi, Jewish, European, and more. The majority of Morocco's population identifies as Berber and Arab. While the two official languages of Morocco are Standard Arabic and Standard Moroccan Berber, most Moroccans speak Darija (Moroccan vernacular Arabic) as a native language. At least a third of the population speaks an Amazigh language, especially Tarifit, Tamazight, or Tashelhit. French, and, to a lesser degree, Spanish, have also been widely used since the colonial period. Language Modern Standard Arabic and Standard Moroccan Berber (Tamazight) are the official languages of Morocco, while Darija () is the national vernacular language; Amazigh dialects, especially Tarifit, Central Atlas Tamazight, and Tashelhit, are also widely spoken. Varieties of Judeo-Arabic have also traditionally been spoken in Morocco. Foreign languages, particularly French, English, and Spanish, are widely spoken in urban centers such as Tangier or Casablanca. With all of these languages, code-switching is an omnipresent phenomenon in Moroccan speech and media. = Arabic = Classical Arabic, a formal rather than natural language, is used primarily in formal, academic, and religious settings. Darija, or Moroccan vernacular Arabic, in its various regional and contextual forms, is used more often in casual situations, at home, and on the street. Hassaniya is a distinct dialect of Arabic spoken in the south of Morocco. = Tamazight = Tashelhit (also known locally as Soussia) is spoken in southwest Morocco, in an area between Sidi Ifni in the south, Agadir in the north, and Marrakesh and the Draa and Sous valleys in the east. Central Atlas Tamazight is spoken in the Middle Atlas, between Taza, Khemisset, Azilal, and Errachidia. Tarifit is spoken in the Rif area of northern Morocco in towns like Nador, Al Hoceima, Ajdir, T√©touan, Taourirt, and Taza. Most Amazigh embraced Islam quickly, though their non-Arab ethnic and linguistic distinction has resisted the Arab-Islamic influence. Hundreds of Amazigh (Berber) associations have been created to defend their culture and identity in the last few decades in Morocco and Algeria. Newsstands and bookstores in all the major cities are filled with new Berber publications that provide articles and essays about the Amazigh culture and art. In 1994, the state- owned TV station RTM (now TVM) started broadcasting a daily, 10-minute-long news bulletin in the 3 Berber dialects. Berber activists are demanding a fifty percent share of broadcasting time in standardized Berber (Tamazight) on all state-owned TV channels. There is also a national Tamazight channel in Morocco, called Tamazight TV. It opened in 2010, and broadcasts for over 13 hours a day, with an extended broadcast on weekends.  Literature  A folio of an 18th century Moroccan Quran, with a characteristically Maghrebi script used to write surahs 105-114. As Amazigh societies primarily practiced oral tradition, the history of Moroccan literature started in the early Middle Ages. In the era of the Berber dynasties, coinciding with the flowering of Al- Andalus, there were several important Moroccan writers, especially in the fields of religion and poetry.  Music  triangular brooches in southern Morocco at the beginning of the 20th century. A group performing ahwash in Tinghir. Moroccan music is characterized by its great diversity from one region to another. It includes Arabic music genres, such as cha√¢bi and aita in the Atlantic plains (Doukkala-Abda, Chaouia-Ouardigha, Rehamna), melhoun in the Andalusi cities (Meknes, Fes, Sal√©, Tetouan, Oujda...), and Hassani in the Moroccan Sahara. There is also Amazigh music such as the Rif reggada, the ahidus of the Middle Atlas and the Souss ahwash. In the South there is also deqqa Marrakshia and gnawa. In addition, young people synthesize the Moroccan spirit with influences from around the world (blues, rock, metal, reggae, Moroccan rap, etc.). A gnawa street performer wearing traditional gnawi clothing in Rabat's Qasbat al-Widaya. Andalusi music is popular in Morocco. It probably evolved under the Moors in Cordoba, and the Persian-born musician Ziryab is usually credited with its invention. Traditional songs such as \\"Shams al-'Ashiya\\" are still played at celebrations and formal events. Dar ul- Aala in Casablanca is a museum and conservatory dedicated to this musical heritage. A genre known as Contemporary Andalusian Music and art is the brainchild of Morisco visual artist/composer/oudist Tarik Banzi, founder of the Al-Andalus Ensemble. Chaabi (\\"popular\\") is a music consisting of numerous varieties which are descended from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally performed in markets, but is now found at any celebration or meeting. Popular Western forms of music are becoming increasingly popular in Morocco, such as fusion, rock, country, metal and, in particular, hip hop. Morocco participated in the 1980 Eurovision Song Contest, where it finished in the penultimate position.  Visual arts  watercolor by Muhammad Ben Ali Rabati, one of Morocco's first painters. The decorative arts have a long and important history in Morocco. One of the traditional elements of artistic expression in Morocco is Maghrebi-Andalusian art and architecture. Carved plaster Arabesques, zellige tilework, carved wood, and other expressions of Islamic geometric patterns are typical features of this style. Maghrebi Arabic script is an important feature of the history of visual art in Morocco. While some aspects of Maghrebi script are codified and prescribed, there have also been innovations, such as those by the 19th century calligrapher Muhammad al-Qandusi. Muhammad Ben Ali Rabati was one of the first Moroccans to paint in a European style.

Since the 1990s-2000s Moroccan cities have welcomed institutions that contribute to the diffusion of contemporary art and the visual arts: L'appartement 22 and Radio Apartment 22 in Rabat, the Cin√©math√®que de Tanger in Tangier, La Source du Lion in Casablanca, Dar Al-Ma'm√ªn residency and center, the Marrakech Art Fair, and the Marrakech Biennale, all in Marrakech. Local art galleries such as Galerie Villa Delaporte, Atelier 21, Galerie Matisse and Galerie FJ are also platforms showing contemporary artwork and contributing to its development.B√©r√©nice Saliou. . Contemporary Art Magazine, Issue 6 The global art market also influences the development and visibility of contemporary art in Morocco; international exhibitions such as \\"Africa Remix\\" (2004) and \\"Uneven Geographies\\" (2010) featured contemporary artists from North Africa, including Moroccan ones. Regional events such as the Dakar Biennale (or Dak'Art ‚Äì Biennale de l'Art Africain Contemporain), a major contemporary African art exhibition, gives greater visibility to artists from the African continent. Moroccan artists and their initiatives Artists born in Morocco or with Moroccan origins include Mounir Fatmi, Latifa Echackhch, Mohamed El Baz, Bouchra Khalili, Majida Khattari, Mehdi-Georges Lahlou, and Younes Baba-Ali. Moroccan artists have devised several initiatives to help develop a contemporary art market in the country. For example, Hassan Darsi created La Source du Lion in 1995, an art studio that welcomes artists- in-residence, and Bouchra Khalili and Yto Barrada founded the Cin√©math√®que de Tanger in 2003, which is dedicated to promoting Moroccan cinematographic culture. A group of seven Moroccan artists, among them Amina Benbouchta, Hassan Echair, Jamila Lamrani, Saf√¢a Erruas and Youn√®s Rahmoun, formed \\"Collectif 212\\" to exhibit their work at Le Cube, an independent art room. Their first major show was in 2006 at the exhibition Un Si√®cle de peinture au Maroc [A century of painting in Morocco] when the new premises of the French Institute of Rabat (L'Institut Fran√ßais de Rabat) were officially opened. They committed to creating artistic experiences in the context of Moroccan culture, as well as collaborating with other artists such as Hicham Benohoud. The young local artists Batoul Shim and Karim Rafi participated in the \\"Working for Change\\" project, which aims to create art expressive of Moroccan culture, during the 2011 Venice Biennale.Alice Planel. Traveling Back to Ourselves: The Maghreb as an Art Destination, p. 4, higheratlas.org.  Art Market  There is a burgeoning market for modern & contemporary art. The art movement began over 50 years ago at the center of Marrakech, in the bustling market place of Jemaa el-Fna, when a group of abstract artists got together and exhibited their work. The exhibit lasted for 10 days and is considered the beginning of a movement in modern and contemporary art. It has been gaining recognition throughout the African continent and globally ever since. Marrakech has emerged as the \\"art capital\\" of Morocco. It houses numerous art museums including the Farid Belkahia Museum, named after one of the leading Jemaa el-Fna artists who died in 2014. Marrakech is home to the Yves Saint Laurent Museum and hosts the annual Marrakech International Film Festival. Tangier is another center for art, producing renowned artists like Ahmed Yacoubi and Abdellatif Zine and Mohamed Hamri whose works are displayed around the world. = Tattooing = Haratin Moroccan women with facial tattooing from Tissint near Tata, Morocco.

Cuisine  Couscous is traditionally enjoyed on Friday, the holy day in Islam. Garnished with vegetables and chickpeas, it is served communally. Moroccan cuisine is generally a mix of Berber, Arab, Andalusi, and Mediterranean cuisines with slight European and sub-Saharan influences. It is known for dishes such as couscous, tajine, and pastilla. Moroccan cuisine uses many herbs, including cilantro, parsley, and mint; spices such as cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, cumin, and saffron; and produce such as tomatoes, onions, garlic, zucchini, bell peppers, and eggplant. One of the defining features of Moroccan cuisine is the interplay between sweet and savory flavors, as exemplified by tfaya, a mix of caramelized onions, butter, cinnamon, sugar, and raisins often served with meat. Historically, couscous has been the staple of the Moroccan diet. On special occasions, more complex meals like the traditional Moroccan pastilla and some special pastries such as gazelle ankles and briwates are served for guests. Mint tea, called atay in Morocco, is commonly regarded as the national beverage.  Celebrations and holidays  = Religious holidays =  Islamic holidays  Morocco' official religion is Islam. The rhythm of life for Moroccans is dictated by religious celebrations throughout the year, such as Ramadan and Eid Al Adha. During these celebrations, most of them being public holidays, Moroccans focus on praying and spending time with their family. Moroccans also celebrate al-Mawlid al-Nabawi, the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad, and the Islamic New Year. Other religious celebrations include the Friday weekly prayer where most Moroccans go to the mosque for the Friday mid-day prayer.  Jewish holidays  Jewish Wedding in Morocco by Eug√®ne Delacroix, Louvre, Paris Morocco has long had a significant Jewish population, distinguished by traditions particular to Moroccan Jews. For example, Mimouna is a characteristically Maghrebi holiday celebrated the day after Passover. Mahia is traditionally associated with Moroccan Purim celebrations. = Folk celebrations = Yennayer, the Amazigh new year, has been celebrated from January 12 to January 13, the beginning of the Julian calendar, since antiquity. Other celebrations include Ashura, the tenth day of the Islamic year, and Bujlood, a folk carnival celebrated after Eid al-Adha.  Festivals  Taburida, or mawsam or fantasia, is a traditional exhibition of horsemanship in the Maghreb performed during cultural festivals and for Maghrebi wedding celebrations. There are also several annual festivals that take place in Morocco, such as the Betrothal Festival in Imilshil, the rose festival in Qalaat Megouna, or the saffron festival in Taliween. Tailoring and weaving = Carpet weaving = Moroccan carpets for sale at a shop on the Street of the Consulates in Rabat. Carpet weaving is a traditional craft in Morocco. Styles vary dramatically from region to region and from tribe to tribe. Among the more popular varieties there are: * Azilal, High Atlas * Bujad, near Khenifra * Beni Warain, Middle Atlas * Beni M'guild, Middle Atlas * Bousherwiit * Kilim *Marmusha *Zanafi *Zemmour Some Atlas tribes, such as the Beni Ouarain, also weave , which are ornate woven cloaks for use in the winter. When it is snowing, they can be overturned and the loose loops of wool help snow fall off to keep the cloak dry. hendira, woven out of wool in the early 20th century =Traditional clothing= A Moroccan kaftan The traditional dress for men and womenhttps://www.morocco- guide.com/culture/traditional-clothing/ is called djellaba (); a long, loose, hooded garment with full sleeves. The djellaba has a hood that comes to a point called a qob. The qob protects the wearer from the sun or in colder climates, like the mountains, the qob keeps in body heat and protects the face from falling snow. For special occasions, men also wear a red cap called a bernousse, more commonly referred to as a Fez. Women wear kaftans () decorated with ornaments. Nearly all men, and most women, wear balgha () ‚Äî- soft leather slippers with no heel, often dyed yellow. Women also wear high-heeled sandals, often with silver or gold tinsel. The distinction between a djellaba and a kaftan is the hood on the djellaba, which a kaftan lacks. Most women's djellabas are brightly colored and have ornate patterns, stitching, or beading, while men's djellabas are usually plainer and colored neutrally. Media Cinema In the first half of the 20th century, Casablanca had many movie theaters, such as Cinema Rialto, Cinema Lynx and Cinema Vox‚Äîthe largest in Africa at the time it was built. The 1942 American film Casablanca is supposedly set in Casablanca and has had a lasting impact on the city's image, though it was filmed entirely in California and doesn't feature a single Moroccan character with a speaking role. Salut Casa! was a propaganda film brandishing France's purported colonial triumph in its civilizing mission in the city. Love in Casablanca (1991), starring Abdelkarim Derqaoui and Muna Fettou, was one of the first Moroccan films to deal with Morocco's complex realities and depict life in Casablanca with verisimilitude. Nour-Eddine Lakhmari's Casanegra (2008) depicts the harsh realities of Casablanca's working classes. The films Ali Zaoua (2000), Horses of God (2012), and Ghazzia (2017) of Nabil Ayouch‚Äîa French director of Moroccan heritage‚Äîdeal with street crime, terrorism, and social issues in Casablanca, respectively. The events in Meryem Benm'Barek-Alo√Øsi's 2018 film Sofia revolve around an illegitimate pregnancy in Casablanca. Hicham Lasri and Said Naciri also from Casablanca.

In 1952 Orson Welles chose Essaouira as the setting for several scenes in his adaptation of Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\", which had won the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film at that year's Cannes Film Festival. In 1955, Alfred Hitchcock directed The Man Who Knew Too Much and in 1962, David Lean shot the Tafas Massacre scene of Lawrence of Arabia in the city of \\"Ouarzazate\\", which houses Atlas Studios. A√Øt Benhaddou has been the setting of many films. The film Hideous Kinky was filmed in Marrakech. Architecture = Qsour = Qsar Tamnugalt, a qsar near Agdz in the Draa Valley. A qsar (p. ) or an is a North African fortified village, especially an Amazigh one. There are over 300 and the Draa Valley, particularly in the area between Agdz and Zagora. = Agadirs = The Id Aissa Agadir near in the Anti-Atlas region. An agadir, not to be confused with the city Agadir, is a communal granary traditionally found in Amazigh communities in southern Morocco. =Gardens= Andalusi gardens, inherited from Morisco refugees who settled in Morocco, are a prominent feature of Moroccan architecture. These have been used in building palaces such as the Bahia Palace in Marrakesh. The Andalusi garden, which usually features a burbling fountain, has an important role in cooling riads: the evaporation of water is an endothermic chemical reaction, which absorbs heat from the area garden and surrounding rooms. Morocco has many beautiful gardens, including the Majorelle Garden in Marrakech and the Andalusian Garden in the Kasbah of the Udayas in Rabat. =Domestic architecture= Asila. The knots are tied with bent metal in the traditional way, rather than soldered. Dar, the name given to one of the most common types of domestic structures in Morocco, is a home found in a medina, or walled urban area of a city. Most Moroccan homes traditionally adhere to the Dar al-Islam, a series of tenets on Islamic domestic life.Verner, p. 9 Dar exteriors are typically devoid of ornamentation and windows, except occasional small openings in secondary quarters, such as stairways and service areas. These piercings provide light and ventilation.Verner, pp. 41‚Äì42 Dars are typically composed of thick, high walls that protect inhabitants from thievery, animals, and other such hazards; however, they have a much more symbolic value from an Arabic perspective. In this culture the exterior represents a place of work, while the interior represents a place of refuge.Verner, pp. 9‚Äì10 Thus, Moroccan interiors are often very lavish in decoration and craft. Consistent with most Islamic architecture, dars are based around small open-air patios, surrounded by very tall thick walls, to block direct light and minimize heat. Intermediary triple-arched porticos lead to usually two to four symmetrically located rooms. These rooms have to be long and narrow, creating very vertical spaces, because the regional resources and construction technology typically only allow for joists that are usually less than thirteen feet. Upon entering a dar, guests move through a zigzagging passageway that hides the central courtyard. The passageway opens to a staircase leading to an upstairs reception area called a dormiria, which often is the most lavish room in the home adorned with decorative tilework, painted furniture, and piles of embroidered pillows and Moroccan rugs. More affluent families also have greenhouses and a second dormiria, accessible from a street-level staircase. Service quarters and stairways were always at the corners of the structures.  Ziliij  Ziliij tile work in a fountain at the Muhammad V Mausoleum in Rabat. Ziliij, colorful geometric mosaic tile work, is a decorative art and architectural element commonly found in Moroccan mosques, mausolea, homes, and palaces. These probably evolved from Greco-Roman mosaics, which have been found in cities such as Volubilis and Lixus. = Modernist architecuture = In the mid to late 20th century, architects such as Elie Azagury, Jean- Fran√ßois Zevaco, Abdeslam Faraoui, Patrice de Mazi√®res, and Mourad Ben Embarek marked the architecture of Casablanca and other parts of Morocco with significant works of modernist and brutalist architecture.

Starting as a network of American graduate schools in the mid-1970s, APSIA was incorporated in 1989 and grew into an international association, with over 60 schools. Member schools meet on a regular basis to discuss educational issues and encourage contact among their students, faculties, and graduates. APSIA schools The Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs comprises 34 member schools and 36 affiliate member programs in Asia, Europe, and North America. Full members of APSIA have undergone a rigorous review process and meet the following qualifications required for full APSIA membership: * an educational program of high academic quality; * a substantial and demonstrated commitment to the study of international affairs; * a commitment to graduate professional training; * at least one master's degree program requiring two years of academic coursework to complete; * at least three classes graduated from its two-year master's degree program; and * significant autonomy within a major university, e.g., as one would expect to find with a law school or graduate business school. Affiliate members of APSIA have undergone a similar review process and meet some but not all of the full membership requirements. The member schools of the APSIA are the primary sources of education for international affairs professionals in their respective countries. These schools provide multidisciplinary, policy-oriented, intercultural studies. Graduates Education at an APSIA school prepares students for work in public service, private enterprise and nonprofit organizations worldwide. Graduates of APSIA schools hold positions in: * federal, state and local governments * international organizations * multinational corporations * international banking and financial institutions * media organizations * consulting firms * professional associations * colleges and universities * policy research centers * cultural and educational exchange programs * development assistance programs foundations Degree programs All APSIA schools offer two-year master's degree programs, covering international relations, public policy, and the world's countries and cultures. Students gain skills in economics, policy analysis, management, communications, and foreign languages. Many APSIA schools offer joint and dual-degree programs that combine the study of international affairs with such fields as law, business, public policy, environmental studies, social work and public health. ;Students Most students at the APSIA schools have studied, worked or traveled overseas. Half are women, and 30 percent are nationals of countries other than the school's. ;Faculty Through their research, writing, teaching and media commentaries, APSIA faculty members contribute to international affairs scholarship. ;Special Programs Midcareer and non-degree programs are open to diplomats, government officials, journalists and other professionals interested in further academic training. APSIA schools sponsor a variety of conferences and seminars on foreign policy issues. Student fellowships ;Harold W. Rosenthal Fellowship in International Relations The Fellowship provides graduate students at APSIA member schools the opportunity to spend a summer working on foreign affairs issues at a U.S. federal government agency or department., Rosenthal Fellowship Official Website. Established in 1977 in memory of Harold Wallace Rosenthal, a US Congressional staffer and victim of international terrorism while on official duty, the Program had hosted 155 Fellows . The European Union Visitors Program (EVP) has selected a minimum of one Rosenthal Fellow every year as an \\"EVP\\" Fellow since the inception of the program. Fellows are selected based on their commitment to public service, education, interest in international relations, and experience. Run in association with APSIA, the Rosenthal Fellowship receives support from a number of individual donors as well as the Rotary Foundation. It formerly received support from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. Fellows are current graduate students in international affairs of any nationality nominated by their schools. ;Japan Travel Program for U.S. Future Leaders The Japan Travel Program allows US graduate students interested in Japan, the U.S.-Japan relationship, and public service to spend ten days in Japan., 2011 Japan Travel Fellows Announced, June 1, 2011. Program Fellows meet with experts and leaders from the business, government, non-profit, and policy sectors. Participants also engage in self-organized research activities in such areas as international economics, foreign policy, public diplomacy, national security, and environmental sustainability. They make excursions to historical and cultural Japanese sites. The Fellows are graduate students from U.S.-based APSIA member schools who have been chosen through a highly competitive selection process. Students are nominated by their school (up to two nominations per school), with the final selection carried out by the Center for Global Partnership (CGP) in conjunction with APSIA.

The miltonias are exclusively inhabitants of Brazil, except for one species whose range extends from Brazil into the northeast of Argentina and the east of Paraguay. The genus of Miltonia was established by John Lindley in 1837, when he described its type species, Miltonia spectabilis. Formerly many more species were attributed to Miltonia, however, beginning in 1978, the miltonias from Central America and from cooler areas of northwest South America have been moved to other genera, including Miltoniopsis and Oncidium, and these changes are still in the process of being accepted by the horticultural trade. Miltonia species have large and long lasting flowers, often in multifloral inflorescences. This fact, allied to being species that are easy to grow and to identify, make them a favorite of orchid collectors all over the world. Species of this genus are extensively used to produce artificial hybrids. Despite the fact that Miltonia is now a well established genus, most of its species were originally classified under other genera as Cyrtochilum, Oncidium, Odontoglossum, and Brassia. All were discovered between 1834 and 1850 with the exception of M. kayasimae, discovered only in 1976. These orchids have two leaves, arising from a pseudobulb, covered with a foliaceous sheath. The inflorescence consists of waxy, nonspurred flowers. The lip is large and flat and lacks a callus at its base. They possess a footless column with two hard pollinia. The flowers have a delicate, exotic scent, some compare to that of roses. They are named after Charles Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 5th Earl Fitzwilliam, formerly Viscount Milton, an English aristocrat, politician, patron of science and horticulture, and orchid enthusiast. The species in this genus are sometimes referred to as the pansy orchids, but it is the Miltoniopsis orchids that have flowers that closely resemble the pansy. Almost everyone except for the most serious orchid hobbyists use the name pansy orchids interchangeably, which may cause confusion. Miltonia looks more like Oncidiums than the other pansy orchids. The most \\"pansy-like\\" a Miltonia can get is the species Miltonia spectabilis. Taxonomists are debating whether to combine Miltonia with the genus Oncidium because of the many connections between the two. Miltoniopsis is the pansy orchid with huge showy flowers. They grow in cooler climates and are more challenging to grow than Miltonia. This genus forms with Miltoniopsis a hybrid genus xMilmiltonia J.M.H.Shaw. Distribution Miltonia candida This is the only species with a labellum that embraces the column in a way that reminds one of the Cattleya species. Miltonia species range starts on the area of Missiones in the northeast of ArgentinaJohnson, Andr√©s E. (2001). Miltonia flavescens in Las orqu√≠deas del Parque Nacional Iguaz√∫, 130.

They occupy mostly areas between 200 and 1,500 meters of altitude meters, however the majority of the species are more often found about 600 to 900 meters. Miltonia species can be found from shady areas inside the forest to areas more exposed to the sun, however never are under full sunlight; usually in ventilated places where they receive plenty humidity during the night and early morning. They are always epiphyte and, because they grow very fast, each pseudobulb originating two new growths every year, they soon form large colonies.Miller, David; Richard Warren; Izabel Moura Miller & Helmut Seehawer (2006). Miltonia in Serra dos √ìrg√£os sua hist√≥ria e suas orqu√≠deas, 323-6. Rio de Janeiro. Miltonia russelliana and M. flavescens are the ones with the widest dispersion and found at lower altitudes. M. flavescens is the only species that exists in countries other than Brazil and is also the one that spreads farther north. M. russelliana range starts on Rio Grande do Sul and ends at Bahia State. M. regnellii is also widespread although does not go northern than Rio de Janeiro. M. moreliana is a species more common at lower altitudes and warmer areas existing from Rio to Pernambuco. Miltonia candida, M. clowesii and M. spectabilis are restricted to the four states of Region Southeast of Brazil. Miltonia cuneata is just from S√£o Paulo and Rio and the one that grow at highest altitudes. M. kayasimae is the only species really rare; it has been found just a couple of times in a very restricted area close to Sales√≥polis, in S√£o Paulo State. The mountains area between S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, where almost all species do exist may be considered the center of distribution of Miltonia.Pabst, Guido & Dungs, Fritz (1978). Orchidaceae Brasilienses 2: 196, Brucke-Verlag Kurt Schmersow, Hildesheim. Description Miltonia regnellii This species shows the widest flower color variation among Miltonia species; they can vary from white to yellow, pink and lilac with labelli also from white to dark purple. Miltonia are comparatively medium large orchid plants reaching about fifty centimeters height. They present subcaespitous growth, that means their pseudobulbs are not tightly packed but slightly spaced by a rhizome, that is longer than on caespitous plants, with length between two and five centimeters. Their roots grow along the rhizome in high numbers. They are white, comparatively thin, usually short and hardly branched. The rhizome is covered by dried imbricating steaths which get increasingly larger at the base of pseudobulb becoming articulated foliar steaths that partially cover them. The pseudobulbs and leaves vary in color from yellowish bright light green to olive green depending on the species and to the amount of sunlight they are exposed to. They may be more oval and laterally highly flattened to slightly tetragonal and elongated and almost always bear two apical leaves. The leaves are narrow, flexible and hardly larger than three centimeters wide and forty long with the apexes rounded sometimes slightly pointed. Some species are about half of this size. The inflorescences are one or two per pseudobulb, shoot from their bases behind the protecting steaths. They are erect and never branched, often longer than the leaves, bearing from one to twelve moderately spaced flowers that open at the same time or in succession holding three or four opened all the time, when the older fades a new one opens. The older flowers of species with white lips that open in succession usually get yellower about the time the next flower opens although they still last one more week before fading. The first to bloom is M. cuneata, during late winter, but the majority of species bloom from late spring to late summer.Cogniaux, C√©lestin Alfred (1903). Miltonia in Flora Brasiliensis 3-6: 267-286. K.F.P. von Martius Ed.. Published on Internet, in Latin. The flowers of Miltonia vary from four to fifteen centimeters across; the larger are the ones with fewer flowers. Their colors vary from entirely white and pink to dark purple, pale yellow or lilac when plain, or they may highly spotted but then usually they are greenish or brownish with a contrasting labellum often white with purple dots, stains or veins close to the base. The petals and sepals shapes are highly variable from species to species but always somewhat similar to each other within a species. They may be erect and flat or sometimes less open. The labellum is simple or very slightly lobed, usually very wide and showy without salient calli although normally showing more or less subtle keeled thickenings close to the base, usually of different colors; it is much larger and wider than the other segments, often flat but in M. candida embraces the column and in all species it is slightly fused to the column at their bases. The short column does not have a foot and presents two lateral auricles sometimes merged to each other through a fringe that surrounds the superior edge of the clinandrium. The anther is apical and bears two yellow hard pollinia. They possibly are pollinated by bees.Hoehne, Frederico C. (1940). Introduction in Flora Bras√≠lica, Vol 12-1: 37-8. Secretaria de Agricultura de S√£o Paulo. Taxonomic notes Miltonia flavescens, illustration. This was the first Miltonia species to be described, originally classified under the genus Cyrtochilum, in 1834. The first species to be described, among the ones today classified under the genus Miltonia, was originally published by John Lindley, in 1834, as Cyrtochilum flavescens. In this description Lindley notices that the flowers of this species turn orange color when drying and, for some confusion regarding the origin of the species, attributes it to Mexico instead of Brazil.Lindley, John (1834). Cyrtochilum flavescens in Edwards's Botanical Register 19: t. 1627. England. Two years later Lindley described another Miltonia species but, then, under the genus Oncidium, as O. russellianum in homage to Duke of Bedford. When describing this plant, Lindley considered it as a transition species pointing out that it was very different from the average Oncidium because of its purple colors and undivided lip.Lindley, John (1836). Oncidium russellianum in Edwards's Botanical Register 22: t. 1830. England. In 1837, Lindley received from Mr. Loddiges and from George Baker two other specimens of a very distinctive new species. Recognizing then this should in fact be a new genus, he proposed the name Miltonia to it as a homage to Charles Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 5th Earl Fitzwilliam, formerly Viscount Milton, an English orchid enthusiast. Lindley states then that the limits between a number of Oncidiinae genera, Cyrtochilum, Oncidium, Odontoglossum, Brassia and Miltonia, at that time classified as Vandaea, were yet to be perfectly established; although closely related, the differences should possibly be: Oncidium has a column with two ears and labellum distinctively lobed; Miltonia has a column with two ears and an entire labellum partially united to the column base; Odontoglossum and Cyrtochilum have winged columns and entire labelli but the former has it partially united to the column; and Brassia does not have any appendages on the column. Although Lindley described the genus Aspasia (which is the most closely related to Miltonia) in 1833, both by flower and vegetative morphologies, he did not mention it on his Miltonia description.Lindley, John (1837). Miltonia spectabilis in Edwards's Botanical Register 23: t. 1992. England. Three other Botanists were working with Miltonia species around the time Lindley described this genus. All recognized these plants should be classified under a new genus and, as communications were slower then, all proposed new genera: Knowles and Westcott also received also a plant of M. spectabilis and, just one month after Lindley, proposed for it the genus Macrochilus, calling the species Macrochilus fryanus;Knowles, George B. & Westcott, Frederic (1837). Macrochilus fryanus in Floral Cabinet 1: 93. England. the other one was Rafinescque who, in 1838, decided that the Oncidium russellianum already described by Lindley in 1836 should be under another genus and created for it the genus Gynizodon.Rafinescque, Constantine S. (1838). Gynizodon russelliana in Flora Telluriana 4: 40.. Both Macrochilus and Gynizodon are synonyms of Miltonia and no other species has ever been submitted to them. Miltonia russelliana This is the less showy of Miltonia species because its sepals and petals do not really open, being always bent over the column, revealing only the lighter tip of its purple labellum. Miltonia clowesii This species has the same color pattern of M. russelliana, however, with a whiter labellum. On the other hand, M. clowesii flowers pointed segments are larger and wide opened making it look like a spider. As Miltonia species are common plants, comparatively large, with also large flowers of bright colors, that, moreover, are spread mostly over an area of early settlements in Brazil all species but one were already described in 1850; six of them by Lindley, M. regnellii by ReichenbachReichenbach, Heinrich G. (1850). Miltonia regnellii in Linnaea 22:: 851. and M. moreliana by Achille Richard.Richard, Achille (1848). Miltonia moreliana in A.Rich., Portef. Hortic. 2: 38.

A morphometric analysis of floral characters in Miltonia spectabilis and M. spectabilis var. moreliana. Lindleyana 17(3): 122-129. Published on Internet. The last Miltonia species to be discovered was M. kayasimae, found by an orchid collector not far from the city of S√£o Paulo, in an area around nine hundred meters of altitude nearby the top of Serra do Mar mountains. It was named after their collector by Guido Pabst in 1976. So far very few plants were found, all living at the same area.Pabst, Guido F.J. (1976). Miltonia kayasimae in Bradea 2: 88. Since the genus Miltonia was established, many species, now classified under a number other genera, were submitted to it. The most noticeable cases were four of the five species of Miltoniopsis,Godefroy-Lebeuf, Alexandre. (1889). Miltoniopsis in Orchidophile 9: 63. Argenteuil. a genus proposed in 1889 but only really accepted in 1976.Garay, Leslie A. & Dunsterville, Galfrid C.K. (1976). Miltoniopsis in Venezuelan Orchids Illustrated. 6: 278. Despite its somewhat similar flowers, Miltoniopsis are from cooler forests on the Andean slopes closely related to Cyrtochilum and only remotely related to Miltonia. Also five of the six Miltonioides species were occasionally considered as Miltonia until 1983 when Brieger and L√ºckel proposed this genus for them.Brieger, Friedrich G. & L√ºckel, Emil (1983). Miltonioides in Orchidee 34: 130. Hamburg. These are species of more delicate and narrower flowers, from Mexico and Central America, which some taxonomists claim might be better classified under the genus Oncidium to whom they are closely related.Williams NH, Chase MW, Fulcher T, Whitten WM (2001). Molecular systematics of the Oncidiinae based on evidence from four DNA sequence regions: expanded circumscriptions of Cyrtochilum, Erycina, Otoglossum, and Trichocentrum and a new genus (Orchidaceae) in Lindleyana 16(2): 113-139. The last common species which was occasionally classified under Miltonia is Chamaeleorchis warszewiczii,Senghas, Karlheinz & L√ºckel, Emil (1997). Chamaeleorchis in Schlechter Orchideen I/C(33-36): 2305. which is related to Oncidium and some taxonomists identify as Oncidium fuscatum. In 1983, Brieger and Lueckel, considering that four species of Miltonia, M. candida, M. cuneata, M. kayasimae and M. russelliana, show the junction of the labellum with the column in a different angle than the other species, proposed the genus Anneliesia for them.Brieger, Friedrich G. & L√ºckel, Emil (1983). Anneliesia in Orchidee 34: 129. Hamburg. Although this four species form a small sister clade to the rest of Miltonia species, the difference did not seem important enough to justify the acceptance of this new genus, therefore this proposal has not been generally accepted by the scientific community. In 2001, based on molecular analysis, Norris Williams and Mark Chase, transferred a species previously classified under the genus Oncidium, as O. phymatochilum, to Miltonia.Williams, Norris H. & Chase Mark W. (2001). Miltonia phymatochila in Lindleyana 16: 284. As this species shows a morphology that closer to Oncidium species than to Miltonia, because of its small yellowish flowers and highly branched inflorescence, this result and following transfer was a great surprise to most taxonomists. In 2005, Eric Christenson suggested a new genus and the name Phymatochilum brasiliense for it.Christenson, Eric A. (2005). Phymatochilum brasiliense in Richardiana 5: 195. There is no consensus about the name to be generally accepted as yet. Molecular analysis show that Miltonia most closely related genus is Phymatochilum and then Aspasia, Brassia and Ada, which are the most important genera included in this that is one of the eight clades that form the subtribus Oncidiinae of tribus Cymbidieae. Species Miltonia cuneata This is the hardest to grow among all Miltonia species, however, as all the others are very easy, this one is not really difficult. This is the one species that needs cooler conditions. Miltonia kayasimae This was the last species to be described and is the rarest one, having been found just a couple of times in S√£o Paulo State, in Brazil. The species of Miltonia show many differences to each other are very easy to identify, therefore, just the most evident differences are mentioned here; more details are given on individual species articles. The species are presented here according to their morphology and this order keeps no correspondence with phylogenetic relationships. Regarding vegetative morphology Miltonia moreliana and Miltonia spectabilis can be immediately separated from the rest because their much flatter pseudobulbs, longer rhizome and inflorescences completely covered by flattened bracts that bear only one highly flat flower. These are the species with largest flowers in the genus. They are closely related and usually are recognized because the flowers of M. moreliana usually have dark purple petals and sepals and the lip of a lighter bright purple while M. spectabilis has very light purple or white petals and sepals and a purple veined labellum, however, the real technical difference among the species is on the proportions of their segments which are much wider. Despite colors are often mentioned to identify species they are not accepted by taxonomy as enough to establish distinct species by themselves. All other Miltonia species have similar vegetative appearance and only can be positively identified by their flowers. Three species are unique: Miltonia flavescens has the most narrow flowers, almost star shaped, with all segments of straw color with some purple bots on the base of petals and sepals which are more intense on the labellum almost forming stripes; Miltonia candida is the only species with a labellum that embraces the column in a way that reminds the Cattleya species;Lindley, John (1838). Miltonia candida in Edwards's Botanical Register 24 (Misc.): 25. England. Miltonia russelliana is the less showy of Miltonia species because its sepals and petals do not really open, being always bent over the column, revealing only the lighter tip of its purple labellum. Miltonia regnellii shows the widest flower color variation among all Miltonia species; they can vary from white to yellow, pink and lilac with labelli also varying from white to dark purple. The flowers open in succession and slightly resemble the ones of M. spectabilis although much smaller. They actually are the Miltonia species with the smallest flowers. Miltonia kayasimae and Miltonia cuneata are somewhat similar and possibly are closely related, both have straw color petals and sepals almost entirely covered by large brown stains and white labelli, however, they show different proportions on the flowers segments. M. kayasimae has much wider petals and sepals and smaller labellum which, moreover, has a larger and more salient and complex entirely purple callus on its base which is delicate, more straight and simple, and just occasionally purple dotted on its apex on M. cuneata. Miltonia clowesii has the same color pattern of M. russelliana with light yellow greenish brown sepals and petals completely covered with large darker dots or stains and labellum of bright purple at the base and lighter apex, however here they are whiter. On the other hand, M. clowesii flowers' pointed segments are larger and wide opened making it resemble a spider.Lindley, John (1840). Miltonia clowesii in Sertum Orchididacearum: t. 34. England. Natural hybrids Miltonia √ó bluntii This is the natural hybrid of M. spectabilis and M. clowesii. Considering its limited number of species, it is surprising that eight natural hybrids of Miltonia are currently known, a number that almost equals the number of species and also implies that the most important pollinator of the majority of the species possibly is the same. As the crossing of two species uses to produce variable plants most of these hybrids have been described more than once and some have three or four synonyms. M. spectabilis is the species which has produced the largest number of hybrids, five: Miltonia √ó bluntii when crossed with M. clowesii, Miltonia √ó cogniauxiae with M. regnellii, Miltonia √ó flava with M. flavescens, Miltonia √ó leucoglossa with M. candida and Miltonia √ó rosina with M. cuneata, furthermore it is possible there is also one with M. moreliana, which has not yet been described because M. moreliana itself was earlier considered a variety of M. spectabilis. M. candida, besides the hybrid already mentioned with M. spectabilis, also produced two others: Miltonia √ó binotii with M. regnellii and Miltonia √ó lamarckeana with M. clowesii. The remaining hybrid, Miltonia √ó peetersiana was previously considered a synonym of M. √ó bluntii but because M. moreliana is now a species distinct from M. spectabilis it is its hybrid with M. clowesii, which has entirely purple flowers instead the one with light brown petals and sepals.Reichenbach, Heinrich G. (1886). Miltonia peetersiana in Gardener Chronicles, n.s., 26: 326. * Miltonia √ó bluntii Rchb.f. (1879) (= Miltonia clowesii √ó Miltonia spectabilis) (Brazil) * Miltonia √ó cogniauxiae Peeters ex Cogn. & Gooss.

(1885) (Miltonia candida √ó Miltonia clowesii) (Brazil) Culture Despite being easy to grow, Miltonia species tend to be subject to spots on their thin leaves, generally caused by fungi proliferation and normally, when exposed to the amount of light they need to a full bloom, their foliage gets a bit too yellow-colored, although they should never be exposed to full sunlight. Finding the right balance of light exposure to avoid yellow leaves but still produce nice blooming is important and with some precautions the grower will succeed. They are not terribly sensitive to temperature, but they do vary according to their species make-up and origin; M. cuneata being one that grows cooler and M. moreliana the warmer growing, but all species under intermediate temperature with at least 10 ¬∞C of variation between day and night. Despite the fact that they exhibit a rest period after blooming, Miltonia always need to be watered, and more abundantly during active growth and blooming. they need at least 65% relative humidity and good ventilation all the time. Moderate weekly fertilizing with a balanced formula is beneficial during active growth. They may be potted in a compost of half-chopped Sphagnum, peat, and some medium-sized lumps of charcoal, or mounted on plaques of vegetable fiber, however if mounted they will need more frequent waterings.Baker, Charles O & Baker, Margaret L.

The Treaty of Fort Jackson (also known as the Treaty with the Creeks, 1814) was signed on August 9, 1814 at Fort Jackson near Wetumpka, Alabama following the defeat of the Red Stick (Upper Creek) resistance by United States allied forces at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. It occurred on the banks of the Tallapoosa River near the present city of Alexander City, Alabama. The U.S. force, led by General Andrew Jackson, consisted mainly of the West Tennessee Militia and 39th United States Infantry, allied with several groups of Cherokee and Lower Creek friendly to the American side. The Upper Creek were led by Chief Menawa, who fled with hundreds of survivors into Florida, where they allied with the Seminole. The surrender ended the Creek War, which the United States was fighting simultaneously with the War of 1812. By the terms of the treaty, the Creek were forced to cede 23 million acres (93,000 km¬≤) of their territory: their remaining land in Georgia and much of central Alabama, to the United States government. This definitive victory freed Jackson to continue southwest to Louisiana, where he defeated the British forces at the Battle of New Orleans. His victories against Native American forces and then his decisive victory at New Orleans won Jackson an enormous amount of popular support, creating a public image that would contribute to his success in the 1828 presidential election. Text of treaty Articles of agreement and capitulation, made and concluded this ninth day of August, one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, between major general Andrew Jackson, on behalf of the President of the United States of America, and the chiefs, deputies, and warriors of the Creek Nation. WHEREAS an unprovoked, inhuman, and sanguinary war, waged by the hostile Creeks against the United States, hath been repelled, prosecuted and determined, successfully, on the part of the said States, in conformity with principles of national justice and honorable warfare‚ÄîAnd whereas consideration is due to the rectitude of proceeding dictated by instructions relating to the re-establishment of peace: Be it remembered, that prior to the conquest of that part of the Creek nation hostile to the United States, numberless aggressions had been committed against the peace, the property, and the lives of citizens of the United States, and those of the Creek nation in amity with her, at the mouth of Duck river, Fort Mimms, and elsewhere, contrary to national faith, and the regard due to an article of the treaty concluded at New-York, in the year seventeen hundred ninety, between the two nations: That the United States, previously to the perpetration of such outrages, did, in order to ensure future amity and concord between the Creek nation and the said states, in conformity with the stipulations of former treaties, fulfill, with punctuality and good faith, her engagements to the said nation: that more than two-thirds of the whole number of chiefs and warriors of the Creek nation, disregarding the genuine spirit of existing treaties, suffered themselves to be instigated to violations of their national honor, and the respect due to a part of their own nation faithful to the United States and the principles of humanity, by impostures [impostors,] denominating themselves Prophets, and by the duplicity and misrepresentation of foreign emissaries, whose governments are at war, open or understood, with the United States. Wherefore, 1st‚ÄîThe United States demand an equivalent for all expenses incurred in prosecuting the war to its termination, by a cession of all the territory belonging to the Creek nation within the territories of the United States, lying west, south, and south-eastwardly, of a line to be run and described by persons duly authorized and appointed by the President of the United States: :Beginn at a point on the eastern bank of the Coosa river, where the south boundary line of the Cherokee nation crosses the same; running from thence down the said Coosa river with its eastern bank according to its various meanders to a point one mile above the mouth of Cedar creek, at Fort Williams, thence east two miles, thence south two miles, thence west to the eastern bank of the said Coosa river, thence down the eastern bank thereof according to its various meanders to a point opposite the upper end of the great falls, (called by the natives Woetumka,) thence east from a true meridian line to a point due north of the mouth of Ofucshee, thence south by a like meridian line to the mouth of Ofucshee on the south side of the Tallapoosa river, thence up the same, according to its various meanders, to a point where a direct course will cross the same at the distance of ten miles from the mouth thereof, thence a direct line to the mouth of Summochico creek, which empties into the Chatahouchie river on the east side thereof below the Eufaulau town, thence east from a true meridian line to a point which shall intersect the line now dividing the lands claimed by the said Creek nation from those claimed and owned by the state of Georgia: Provided, nevertheless, that where any possession of any chief or warrior of the Creek nation, who shall have been friendly to the United States during the war and taken an active part therein, shall be within the territory ceded by these articles to the United States, every such person shall be entitled to a reservation of land within the said territory of one mile square, to include his improvements as near the centre thereof as may be, which shall inure to the said chief or warrior, and his descendants, so long as he or they shall continue to occupy the same, who shall be protected by and subject to the laws of the United States; but upon the voluntary abandonment thereof, by such possessor or his descendants, the right of occupancy or possession of said lands shall devolve to the United States, and be identified with the right of property ceded hereby. 2nd‚ÄîThe United States will guarantee to the Creek nation, the integrity of all their territory eastwardly and northwardly of the said line to be run and described as mentioned in the first article. 3d‚ÄîThe United States demand, that the Creek nation abandon all communication, and cease to hold any intercourse with any British or Spanish post, garrison, or town; and that they shall not admit among them, any agent or trader, who shall not derive authority to hold commercial, or other intercourse with them, by license from the President or authorized agent of the United States. 4th‚ÄîThe United States demand an acknowledgment of the right to establish military posts and trading houses, and to open roads within the territory, guaranteed to the Creek nation by the second article, and a right to the free navigation of all its waters. 5th‚ÄîThe United States demand, that a surrender be immediately made, of all the persons and property, taken from the citizens of the United States, the friendly part of the Creek nation, the Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Choctaw nations, to the respective owners; and the United States will cause to be immediately restored to the formerly hostile Creeks, all the property taken from them since their submission, either by the United States, or by any Indian nation in amity with the United States, together with all the prisoners taken from them during the war. 6th‚ÄîThe United States demand the caption and surrender of all the prophets and instigators of the war, whether foreigners or natives, who have not submitted to the arms of the United States, and become parties to these articles of capitulation, if ever they shall be found within the territory guaranteed to the Creek nation by the second article. 7th‚ÄîThe Creek nation being reduced to extreme want, and not at present having the means of subsistence, the United States, from motives of humanity, will continue to furnish gratuitously the necessaries of life, until the crops of corn can be considered competent to yield the nation a supply, and will establish trading houses in the nation, at the discretion of the President of the United States, and at such places as he shall direct, to enable the nation, by industry and economy, to procure clothing. 8th‚ÄîA permanent peace shall ensue from the date of these presents forever, between the Creek nation and the United States, and between the Creek nation and the Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Choctaw nations. 9th‚ÄîIf in running east from the mouth of Summochico creek, it shall so happen that the settlement of the Kennards, fall within the lines of the territory hereby ceded, then, and in that case, the line shall be run east on a true meridian to Kitchofoonee creek, thence down the middle of said creek to its junction with Flint River, immediately below the Oakmulgee town, thence up the middle of Flint river to a point due east of that at which the above line struck the Kitchofoonee creek, thence east to the old line herein before mentioned, to wit: the line dividing the lands claimed by the Creek nation, from those claimed and owned by the state of Georgia. The parties to these presents, after due consideration, for themselves and their constituents, agree to ratify and confirm the preceding articles, and constitute them the basis of a permanent peace between the two nations; and they do hereby solemnly bind themselves, and all the parties concerned and interested, to a faithful performance of every stipulation contained therein. In testimony whereof, they have hereunto, interchangeably, set their hands and affixed their seals, the day and date above written.

Route =Gauteng= The Route begins at Bapsfontein, Ekurhuleni, Gauteng at the 4-way intersection with the R25 Route and the R50 Route. As Pretoria Road, it heads south-south-west for 10km up to Petit (East of Kempton Park and north-east of Benoni), where it meets the M44 Metropolitan Route and continues by way of a left turn to become Geldenhuys Street southwards. After 4km, the R51 continues by way of a right turn at Aloe Road to become Kingsway Road, bypassing Benoni Farms. As Kingsway Road, it makes up the western border of Daveyton, separating it from Benoni Farms, before crossing the N12 Highway (Johannesburg-eMalahleni Highway). Just after the N12 Crossing (by Kingsway), the R51 is joined by the R29 Route from Benoni Central and they are one road southwards for 5km before splitting in the vicinity of Springs (the R29 becomes 4th Avenue eastwards). By Wright Park, at the eastern terminus of the R554, the R51 turns eastwards and by Springs Country Club, the R51 turns southwards. From Springs, the R51 crosses the N17 Highway and makes a 20km journey south to Nigel. From Springs to Nigel, the R51 is followed by and is parallel to the M63 Metropolitan Route. In Nigel, at the main 4-way junction before the Glenverloch Suburb, the R51 joins the road going east and is cosigned with the R42 Route and the R550 Route for 2 kilometres, making up the northern border of the Nigel CBD. At the Balfour Road Junction, the R51 and the R550 split from the R42 Road to become the road heading south-east. After the Laversburg suburb, just after crossing the Blesbokspruit, the R550 becomes its own road eastwards, leaving Balfour Road with the R51 designation. =Mpumalanga= From Nigel, the R51 makes a south-south-easterly 33km journey, crossing into Mpumalanga Province, meeting the R548, to Balfour. It enters Balfour southwards as Joubert Street, before turning east, then south at Dyer Street to cross the Balfour Railway southwards. After the Railway crossing, it makes a right turn at Johnny Mokoena Drive and then a left turn to become Joubert Street again. South of Balfour, the R51 meets the bypassing R23 Heidelberg-Standerton Road at a roundabout. From Balfour, The R51 makes a southward 40km journey, passing Grootvlei and its power station, making a left turn, to end at the N3 Johannesburg-Durban Highway (In Mpumalanga, just north of the Vaal River, which separates it from the town of Villiers in the Free State Province on the other side).

Gabby lives in the Okiedokie Swamp, which is a play on Lake Okeechobee and is near Cape Canaveral. Unfortunately for him, this place does not have many food options, and Gabby is forced to attract the food (usually Woody Woodpecker) to his home and attempt to capture him with anything he might have at hand, including highly advanced technology. Though Gabbie Gator is intelligent and crafty, Woody always escapes, usually leaving Gabby with his home destroyed. The strangest thing about Gabby Gator is that he seems to have a vast supply of carrots, which are useless for a carnivorous reptile. Appearance Gabby is a green alligator who has a yellow or green stomach and snout, depending on the episode, wears a red or purple hat, also depending on the episode, wears a yellow vest, and has two fangs poking out of his muzzle. He speaks with a southern accent, similar to that of Hanna- Barbera's Huckleberry Hound. History Gabby Gator first appeared as \\"Ali Gator\\" in the 1958 short Everglade Raid. In that short, Gabby‚Äîor \\"Ali\\"‚Äîtries to cook Woody for lunch. \\"Ali\\" appeared again in 1959's Romp in a Swamp. Gabby's first official appearance under his definitive name was in Southern Fried Hospitality, when he hadn't eaten much lately and caught Woody to stave off his starvation. Gabby did not become as famous as Woody's renowned enemies like Buzz Buzzard and Wally Walrus. His final theatrical appearance was in Greedy Gabby Gator in 1963.

Route The R54 begins at a junction with the N12 Road 9 kilometres north-east of Potchefstroom, North West. It heads eastwards, crossing into Gauteng Province and meeting the R500 Road. 62km from Potchefstroom, the R54 passes under the N1 Kroonvaal Toll Route and enters the Vaal Triangle. North of Vanderbijlpark (South of Sebokeng; just after the N1 overbridge), the R54 meets the R553 Road and the R28 Route. The R28 Route stops cosigning with the R553 Road southwards and begins cosigning with the R54 Road eastwards towards Vereeniging, bypassing Vanderbijlpark. After 6km, the R54 becomes its own road eastwards as Houtkop Road, bypassing Vereeniging Central, leaving the R28 as the road towards Vereeniging Central. Next, the R54 has a 4-way-junction with the R82 Road (Voortrekker Street) from Johannesburg at the northern end of Vereeniging Central, right next to the R59 Sybrand van Niekerk Freeway Off-ramp. At Klip River Drive, The R54 makes a left turn and makes up the northern border of the Three Rivers suburb. North of Three Rivers East, the R54 meets the R42 Road from Heidelberg and they are cosigned southwards up to the next junction, where the R42 becomes its own road into Three Rivers (General Hertzog Road), leaving the R54 as the road south-east. The R54 makes a 21km journey to meet the R549 Road near the north- western corner of the Vaal Dam. It continues another 50km, following the Vaal River, bypassing Vaal Marina, to end in Mpumalanga Province at an intersection with the N3 Johannesburg-Durban Freeway, in the area where the Vaal River makes up its border with Villiers, Free State. It meets the southern terminus of the R51 Route at the same place. Just before the N3 Interchange, the R54 meets a road which provides access to the town of Villiers in the Free State via a small bridge that only allows cars going one direction to cross it at a time (using a traffic light system). This is the only alternative way to cross the nearby Vaal River (Gauteng-Free State Border) into the town of Villiers apart from the N3. The total length of the route from the N12 junction outside Potchefstroom to the N3 Interchange near Villiers is 159 Kilometres.

The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants.  Taxonomy Before the 2012 restructuring, two large groups of species had long been recognized in the genus Mimulus as it was traditionally defined, with the largest group of species in western North America, and a second group with center of diversity in Australia. In the 2012 restructuring of Mimulus by Barker, et al., based largely upon DNA evidence, seven species were left in Mimulus, 111 placed into Erythranthe (species with axile placentation and long pedicels), 46 placed into Diplacus (species with parietal placentation and sessile flowers), two placed in Uvedalia, and one each placed in Elacholoma, Mimetanthe, and Thyridia. Removal of Mimulus from family Scrophulariaceae has been supported by studies of chloroplast DNA first published in the mid-1990s. Multiple studies of chloroplast DNA and two regions of nuclear rDNA suggest that the genera Phryma, Berendtiella, Hemichaena, Leucocarpus, Microcarpeae, Peplidium, Glossostigma, and Elacholoma are all derived from within Mimulus and would need to be rearranged.  Species of Mimulus sensu stricto The species remaining in Mimulus are: * Mimulus alatus - Sharpwing monkey-flower (eastern North America) * Mimulus aquatilis - (Queensland, Australia) * Mimulus gracilis - (Australia) * Mimulus madagascariensis - (Madagascar) * Mimulus orbicularis - (Bangladesh to Myanmar, central Thailand and Vietnam) * Mimulus ringens - Allegheny monkey-flower, square-stemmed monkey-flower (eastern North America) * Mimulus strictus - (Africa, India and Australia)  References  External linksMimulus Database - for genetics researchers *Mimulus Genome Browser - for genetics researchers Lamiales genera ","title":"Mimulus"},{"id":"1857366","text":"The R55 is a north-south provincial route in Gauteng, South Africa that connects Sandton with Pretoria. It passes Woodmead, Kyalami, Olievenhoutbosch, Heuweloord, Sunderland Ridge, Erasmia, Laudium/Claudius, West Park, the Daspoort Tunnel and Danville. It connects with the M1, N14, and R80 highways. It is also designated as the P66-1 and K71 (newly constructed dual carriageway sections) by the Gauteng Provincial Government.http://gauteng.roadprojects.co.za/Default.aspx?alias=gauteng.roadprojects.co.za/gpk71 Route The southern terminus of R55 begins as a t-junction with the M11/R101 Pretoria Main Road. It then crosses and interchanges the M1 De Villiers Graaff freeway/Ben Schoeman Highway as it heads northwards through Woodmead. Leaving Woodmead, it crosses under the N1 Western Bypass before interchanging with Maxwell Drive (R564 Road) in Sunninghill. It continues into Barbeque Downs before crossing the Jukskei River into Kyalami where M39 Allandale Road intersects. Leaving the Kyalami Estate, the M71 Main Road t-junctions the route. Continuing north-east, it passes through the Blue Hills agricultural holdings crossing Summit Road (R562 Road) then passing through the suburb of Olievenhoutbosch. Leaving the latter behind, it intersects the Junction 317 at the N14. Shortly after crossing the N14, it intersects the R114 in the outskirts of Heuwelsig, Centurion at a staggered junction. Heading northwards, the M10 intersects from the route west close to Sunderland Ridge and later the M24 from the east, close to the Zwartkops Raceway. Continuing to Laudium, the M26 intercepts the route just south of the suburb. Leaving Laudium towards the northeast, it enters Pretoria West as Quagga Road where it intersects the M22. At this intersection, the R55 then turns north as Transoranje Road passing through West Park and Proclaimation Hill crossing the R104 and shortly thereafter the M4 Magalies Freeway. The R55 Transoranje Road heads north through Danville where it passes through the Daspoort Tunnel. Leaving the tunnel, it continues north through Claremont, Daspoort and Booysens crossing the R80 intersection and after a short distance ends as a t-junction with Denyssen Avenue in Suiderberg, Northern Pretoria. History/Future Although parts of the road in Johannesburg were widened in 2005, other single-lane sections of the route, especially in Centurion, were in a dangerous state, due to the high volumes of traffic and presence of heavy vehicles causing the road surface to deteriorate. Renovation of a section in Centurion between the N14 and M10/Wierda Road intersection near Sunderland Ridge began in 2007, with construction largely completed by September 2010. The large Monavoni Circle was replaced with traffic lights, and a dual carriageway was built in this section, with surfaced shoulders to replace the existing narrow two-lane single carriageway.http://gauteng.roadprojects.co.za/Default.aspx?alias=gauteng.roadprojects.co.za/gpk71 http://www.velavke.co.za/projects.htm?action=view-item&id;=766 Also, as a result of a fatal accidenthttp://www.citizen.co.za/index/article.aspx?pDesc=88925,1,22 the existing N14 offramp from Centurion was converted into a four-way stop temporarily, and traffic lights were later installed. Extension of the 4 lane dual-carriageway, to replace the section between the M10/Wierda Road intersection and Erasmia, a narrow two-lane single carriageway, passing over the Hennops River, which was overloaded and had severely deteriorated, began in late 2010, and was largely completed by late 2012, along with the installation of lighting on the newly constructed sections, including the previously rebuilt section between Weirda Road and the N14. The remaining provincially maintained (existing) dual-carriageway stretch beyond Erasmia, and part of the municipally-owned section beyond Laudium to the Maunde Street entrance to Atteridgeville was rehabilitated in 2014. Old routing through Johannesburg There are a few roads in Johannesburg which have the R55 designation given to them. Empire road from the University of Johannesburg in Auckland Park eastwards across the M1 De Villiers Graaff Motorway and Jan Smuts Avenue has signs on the road indicating the R55 route. In Hillbrow, the road starting as Claim Street southwards, becoming Mooi Street in Johannesburg CBD, also has signposts on it indicating the R55 route. From Johannesburg Central south up to Wemmer Pan (where the road meets the western terminus of the N17 Highway), together with being called the M11 road, may also be called the R55 road.

She is the lover of the titular protagonist Hiawatha and comes to a tragic end. The name, often said to mean \\"laughing water\\", literally translates to \\"waterfall\\" or \\"rapid water\\" in Dakota.Dakota Dictionary Online The figure of Minnehaha inspired later art works such as paintings, sculpture and music. The Death of Minnehaha is a frequent subject for paintings. Minnehaha Falls and her death scene inspired themes in the New World Symphony by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. Longfellow's poem was set in a cantata trilogy, The Song of Hiawatha in 1898‚Äì1900 by the African-English composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. Longfellow's poem also inspired Hugo Kaun's symphonic poems \\"Minnehaha\\" and \\"Hiawatha\\" composed in 1901. Minnehaha Feeding Birds, Frances Anne Hopkins, ca. 1880 Death of Minnehaha by William de Leftwich Dodge, 1885 John Henry Bufford's cover for The Death of Minnehaha, 1856  Minnehaha as a name  The character's name has been bestowed upon things, especially in the Great Lakes region of the United States. A ship bearing the name Minnehaha wrecked off the western shore of Lake Michigan in 1893, only 38 years after Longfellow's poem was published. A Minnehaha Bay adjoins the small town of Sturgeon Falls in Ontario, Canada. Minnesota claims Minnehaha Falls, Minnehaha Park, Minnehaha Creek, Minnehaha Academy, and a boat bearing her name once operated by Twin City Rapid Transit on Lake Minnetonka, which has now been restored and is currently operated by Museum of Lake Minnetonka. Minnehaha Avenue and Hiawatha Avenue run parallel to each other from downtown Minneapolis, while another Minnehaha Avenue runs through Saint Paul. Farther west, Minnehaha, Washington stands near Vancouver. Her name is also linked to Minnehaha County in South Dakota and Minnehaha Covenant Church and Minnehaha Park in Spokane, Washington. Lake Minnehaha is located in the center of Holliday Park in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Arizona's Bradshaw Mountains contain a Minnehaha Flat. Toward the Atlantic coast, a Minnehaha Island stands in the Potomac River in Montgomery County, Maryland (). A creek known as Minnehaha Branch empties into the Potomac at Glen Echo, Maryland. The town of Minnehaha Springs stands in Pocahontas County, West Virginia. Farther south, Minnehaha Falls in Lakemont, Georgia near Lake Rabun features a 100-foot cascading waterfall. Florida is home to two lakes named Minnehaha: one in the Clermont Chain of lakes in Clermont, Florida, one of the Outstanding Florida Waterbodies; the other in Maitland, Florida, linked to the Winter Park lake chain. Minnehaha's name has proven inspirational beyond the North American continent: Roca Minnehaha is an island near Easter Island and Sala y G√≥mez Island in Chile. Two avenues in suburbs of Auckland, New Zealand, in Titirangi and Takapuna, are named for the figure. Minnehaha Falls may be found in Katoomba, Australia. Minne Ha Ha is also the name of a fully functional steamboat operated on Lake George New York by the Lake George Steamboat Company  In popular culture  Minnehaha is also the main character of the Adventures in the Old West four-book series by Emilio Salgari, Sulle Frontiere del Far-West (1908), La Scotennatrice (1909), Le Selve Ardenti (1910), and La Vendetta di Minnehaha (?). In its Germanized form, Mine-Haha, the name was used by the German writer Frank Wedekind for the heroine of his 1903 novella Mine-Haha, or On the Bodily Education of Young Girls.

It was created in 1970 by the State of California, with support from the Bay Area Council, to coordinate transportation services in the Bay Area's nine counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma.About MTC The MTC is fourth most populous metropolitan planning organization in the United States. Duties MTC is designated a regional transportation planning agency (RTPA) by the State of California and a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) by the federal government. MTC is not the Bay Area's council of governments (COG); the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) holds that role. MTC administers state-provided money through the Transportation Development Act (TDA) and has decision-making authority over the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP). MTC administers federal funding through various grant programs, including the Transportation for Livable Communities (TLC) Program, Low Income Flexible Transportation (LIFT) Program, and Innovative Climate Grants Program. MTC has overseen administration of toll revenue collected on the seven State-owned bridges in the Bay Area through the Bay Area Toll Authority (BATA) since 2005. From 1997 through 2004, BATA administered only a portion of the toll revenue. Since 1999, MTC has worked to implement a regional transit fare-collection system called Clipper (formerly TransLink), where transit riders use a single card to pay fares on the region's different transit systems. MTC manages various regional operational programs, including 511, the Freeway Service Patrol (FSP), call boxes, ridesharing, FasTrak electronic toll collection, regional pavement management (including the pavement management system software StreetSaver), arterial operations, and regional signal timing programs. MTC operates a libraryLibrary that jointly supports MTC and ABAG. The library, which is open to the public, has a collection covering transportation and planning issues for the Bay Area. Governing structure MTC is guided by a 21-member board of commissioners: * Sixteen commissioners are appointed by local elected officials.  The five most populous counties have two representatives each: The respective counties' board of supervisors select one representative, and the mayors of the cities within the respective counties appoint the other. The Mayor of Oakland and the Mayor of San Jose each appoint a commissioner  The four remaining counties appoint one commissioner each, with the commissioners representing both the cities and the board of supervisors for their respective counties. * Two members represent regional agencies: ABAG and the Bay Conservation and Development Commission. * Three non-voting members are appointed to represent the federal housing department and federal and state transportation agencies. MTC is headquartered in San Francisco and has a staff of approximately 130 people. In July 2016, the ABAG board approved the consolidation of its staff under MTC, combining the work of the Bay Area's two primary regional planning agencies.

The parish had a population of 17,935 at the 2001 census. Madeley is recorded in the Domesday Book, having been founded before the 8th century. Historically, Madeley's industrial activity has largely been in mining, and later, manufacturing, which is still a large employer in the town, along with service industries. Parts of the parish fall within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ironbridge Gorge, the site of The Iron Bridge, and a key area in the development of Industry. History The settlement of Madeley is recorded as far back as the Domesday Book. The town was founded prior to the 8th century, and subsequently became a market town in the 13th century. Sigward, a local ruler in the time of King √Üthelbald of Mercia, is said to have held 3 hides of land at Madeley.Victoria County History: Shropshire, volume 11: Telford, chapter 13: Madeley ‚Äì Manor and other estates, s.1 Between 727 and 736 he sold his holdings to Mildburh, daughter of Merewalh, sub-king of the Magons√¶te. She was the founder and first head of Wenlock Abbey. The monastery was refounded as a Cluniac priory after the Norman conquest but the manor of Madeley belonged to the church of Wenlock, throughout the Middle Ages, until the Dissolution of the monasteries. It passed to the Crown in 1540 and in 1544 was sold to Robert Broke, a prominent lawyer and politician from Claverley. Mining of coal began before 1322, and the extraction of ironstone had begun by 1540. The town played a role in the English Civil War, as it was home to a garrison of Royalist soldiers in 1645, although this post was abandoned after the fall of Shrewsbury. Two months later, Parliamentary forces occupied the parish church. Madeley is also home to a barn in which King Charles II hid after the Battle of Worcester in 1651. In the 17th century, Madeley was a small market town, but local tradesmen began to specialise, working in the river trade and in mining. In the 18th century, The Iron Bridge was built between Madeley Wood and Coalbrookdale and the settlement of Ironbridge grew by it, which took some of the commercial trade away from the old town of Madeley, including its market. Madeley Court Gatehouse In the 1970s, significant construction of new housing and recreation areas was undertaken by the Dawley Development Corporation, later known as the Telford Development Corporation, as part of the development of Telford New Town. Several of Madeley's historical sites of interest are waypoints on the South Telford Heritage Trail including: Madeley Court, Madeley High Street, Jubilee House, St Michael's Church, Madeley Windmill and the Madeley Salop Railway Station. The gatehouse to Madeley Court is a grade I listed building. Governance Madeley is located within the civil parish and ward of the same name. The ward is within the Telford constituency, which is currently represented by Conservative MP Lucy Allan. In terms of local government, the town has representation in the local Town Council, Madeley Town Council, with six councillors representing the town,. However, the term \\"Madeley\\" sometimes refers in a broader sense to a larger geographical area incorporating the town of Madeley and the neighbouring areas of Sutton Hill, Sutton Heights and Woodside, and all four fall within the boundaries of Madeley Town Council. The current composition of Madeley Town Council is 15 Labour, 1 Conservative and 1 Independent. The town is administered on the borough level by Telford and Wrekin unitary authority, and is represented as part of the Madeley and Sutton Hill ward by 2 Labour and 1 Conservative councillor. The parish of Madeley formerly incorporated Ironbridge, which has since become part of the new parish of The Gorge. Geography Madeley shown within Telford in Maroon. Madeley is situated in the southern part of the new town of Telford, to the north of Ironbridge and the River Severn. Coalport, a part of the parish of Madeley can be found to the west of the town, and the modern Telford Town Centre is north of the settlement. The local area has reserves of coal and ironstone. Part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Ironbridge Gorge falls within the Parish of Madeley. The majority of the site is within the parish of The Gorge, named for the Ironbridge Gorge, which is bridged by The Iron Bridge. Demography At the 2001 census, the population of the parish of Madeley was 17,935. Of this number, 8,190 were economically active, and of them, 7,477 were in employment. The ethnicity of the population was as follows: 96% of the population was found to be White, and 1.9% Asian, or Asian British. 1.3% of the population was mixed race, 0.6% Black or Black British and a further 0.2% Chinese. In terms of religion: 77% of the population are Christian, and 14.4% are of no religion. 0.7% of the population are Muslim, 0.5% are Sikh, 0.3% are Hindu, and 0.1% are Buddhist. Economy Historically, Madeley was a mining town serving the now defunct Kemberton Colliery. It was also home to the Madeley Wood Company. By 2001, manufacturing was still a large employer in the town, with 33.1% of parish residents employed in that area. 20.7% were employed in wholesale, retail and hotels, and 11.8% in finance and business services. 5.3% of residents were unemployed. Transport The B4373 runs through the town, and the A4169 runs along its northern edge. The nearest motorway is the M54, which connects Telford to the West Midlands conurbation and the rest of the motorway network. Town bus services are provided by Arriva Midlands, and a community bus service is provided. Near Madeley is Madeley Junction, a railway junction and its accompanying signal box. The line from this junction runs to Lightmoor Junction, and was used to carry coal to Ironbridge Power Station. The nearest National Rail station to the town is Telford Central. It was also served the Coalport Branch Line from 1860 until 1952. The station remains intact and the former trackbed forms part of the Silkin Way. Education There are a number of nurseries and primary schools in Madeley, and two secondary schools: Abraham Darby Academy and Madeley Academy. Haughton School, a special school for students aged five to eleven is located in the town. Religious sites St Michael's Church There are three churches in the centre of Madeley: St Michael's, a Church of England parish church, which was designed in its present form by Thomas Telford; Madeley Baptist Church; and St Mary's Roman Catholic church, part of the Diocese of Shrewsbury. The Fletcher Methodist Centre can be found in the town, and on the Tweedale Industrial Estate near Madeley is the Springfield Christian Fellowship. Notable people Residents of the town of Madeley have included Sir Basil Brooke of Madeley Court, who was instrumental in the Industrial Revolution. He was born in the local manor (which he later inherited) in 1576. His grandfather, Robert Brooke, was a former Speaker of the House of Commons. Mary Bosanquet Fletcher, one of the first female Methodist preachers, and John William Fletcher, her husband and fellow Methodist preacher, had a joint ministry in the parish of Madeley in the 18th century.John A. Hargreaves, ‚ÄòFletcher , Mary (1739‚Äì1815)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2005 accessed 18 March 2017 John's iron tombstone is in the parish churchyard. Major Charles Allix Lavington Yate VC, is another former resident of the town, who earned the Victoria Cross in the First World War. He was kinsman of Colonel Sir Charles Yate, 1st Baronet, (1849‚Äì1940) British soldier and administrator in India, who retired to Madeley Hall and is buried in the parish churchyard. Mary Whitehouse taught art at Madeley Modern School (now the Abraham Dardy Academy) in Madeley, Shropshire from 1960, taking responsibility for sex education. Shocked at the moral beliefs of her pupils, she became concerned about what she and many others perceived as declining moral standards in the British media, especially in the BBC. = Other notable people = James Glazebrook (1744‚Äì1803) English cleric, controversialist, and writer. * Samuel Thorp (c.1765-1838) clockmaker * Sir Wyke Bayliss (1835‚Äì1906) British painter, author and poet. * Peter Jackson (historian) * Wesley Spragg (1848‚Äì1930) New Zealand butter manufacturer, exporter and temperance campaigner. * Harold William Timperley (1890‚Äì1964) English author of local history and topographical studies * Edith Mary Pargeter, (best known as Ellis Peters) OBE, BEM (1913‚Äì1995), English author of history and historical fiction, lived in Madeley from 1956 to 1995. * Billy Wright, CBE (1924‚Äì1994) former captain of Wolves and the England football team, attended Madeley Senior School, now the Abraham Darby Academy.

Founded by Ernesto Alayza Grundy, Luis Bedoya Reyes, Mario Polar Ugarteche, H√©ctor Cornejo Ch√°vez, Roberto Ram√≠rez del Villar and others. Development The PDC had its roots in the government of Jos√© Bustamante y Rivero who was overthrown in 1948 by Manuel A. Odr√≠a although it did not emerge as an organised until 1956 when it was one of a number of populist parties formed following Odria's announcement of a new democracy (the other major ones being Popular Action and the Progressive Social Movement).Neira, p. 440 The new party gained seats in both houses in the 1956 elections and initially they only concentrated their efforts on the Congress rather than running for the Presidency. A change in policy followed in 1962 when Cornejo was a candidate for the Presidency but he only managed 2.88% of the vote and the party was eliminated from Congress. As a result of this failure and the coup that overthrew Manuel Prado Ugarteche the PDC threw in their lot with the Popular Action and as such returned to Congress in 1963 as junior partners in the coalition supporting new President Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry.Neira, p. 440-441 The party returned to government as a partner in APRA- led government of Alan Garc√≠a, remaining in office until 1990. Ideology and divisions The PDC advocated a strong nationalism, a community-minded approach to politics and state interventionism, with a grouping on the left even advocating nationalisation of the oil industry.Neira, p. 441 In the end the right of the party split off in 1966 to set up the Christian People's Party although in the short term at least the majority of the membership remained with the PDC.Neira, p. 442 Support The PDC gained a following in Lima to the extent that the party was able to defeat strong candidates from Popular Action and the Odri√≠st National Union in order to have Luis Bedoya Reyes elected Mayor of Lima. In general however the party's prospects were hampered by an anti-clericalism prevalent in Peru and, whilst it gained some support amongst middle class women, it never seriously challenged Popular Action for the centre right vote.

Odr√≠a. The party had Julio de la Piedra amongst its leaders. Development The party had its origins in Odr√≠a's military regime, which ended in 1956 when he left the country. Odr√≠a's popularity grew after he left office, largely due to the high level of public works that his administration had brought in. His spending policies, however, had left a high level of public debt and it fell to the government of Manuel Prado Ugarteche to cope with this. The result was the creation of a myth that Odr√≠a's rule had been one of prosperity in contrast to Prado's (although much of the problems were due to a fall in demand for raw materials following the end of the Korean War).Neira, p. 445 As a consequence Odr√≠a was able to return and set up UNO in 1961, and the party quickly became the country's third biggest behind Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana and Popular Action. Although dominated by its leader the party did have a wider structure which included a national executive, a consultative committee and a series of locally based shop and area committees.Neira, p. 449 Julio de la Piedra was the leading figure behind Odr√≠a, serving as chairman of the party as well as their leader in the Chamber of Deputies. Support In elections support for the UNO came mainly from three sources. These were: *Inhabitants of the barriadas particularly in Lima where Odr√≠a topped the polls in the annulled 1962 Peruvian general election. He scored highly even in traditionally left wing areas of the city such as La Victoria.Neira, p. 446 *UNO generally came off third best in the country's regions except in the Piura Region, the Tacna Region and the Callao Region. These areas had been main beneficiaries of investment schemes during Odr√≠a's rule (notably irrigation schemes) and as such his support held up.Neira, pp. 446-7 *Supporters of the Partido Restaurador del Peru, the name given to the official party of state that Odr√≠a had set up in 1948. This included key people he had placed in the trade unions and middle class groups, as well as people from poor backgrounds who had been given jobs and health care by his government.Neira, pp. 447-8 Programme The party represented the far right of politics in Peru.Neira, p. 444 However whilst it had some highly conservative principles, notably to do with the special status of the Roman Catholic Church and investment capitalism, it followed the line of the main parties with regards to development and social justice.Neira, p. 448 The party has been critical of democracy and espoused authoritarianism, feeling that the competitive party system led to inefficiency and stopped important decisions from being made. Above all however, the driving force behind the UNO was the cult of personality built up around Odr√≠a and the achievements of his government. Disappearance and return The 1968 coup which saw Juan Velasco Alvarado brought to power also saw UNO disappear from the political scene. De la Piedra meanwhile broke away, and formed his Nationalist Social Democrat Party the same year. The UNO name was revived first in the 1989 Lima mayoral election when they put up Italian-born panettone entrepreneur Angelo Rovegno for mayor of Lima; he and others lost to Ricardo Belmont Cassinelli. In the subsequent 1990 Peruvian Presidential election, lawyer Dora Narrea de Castillo ran under the party name, being the first woman ever to run for President of Peru. However, by this time Odr√≠a was long dead and his government a distant memory and so only 0.3% of the vote was secured in an election which brought Alberto Fujimori to power.Peruvian election results Enrique Odr√≠a Sotomayor, his nephew, has registered \\"Alternancia Per√∫ UNO\\" as a political party.

They were invented and classified by the German topologist Friedhelm Waldhausen in 1967. This definition allows a very convenient combinatorial description as a graph whose vertices are the fundamental parts and (decorated) edges stand for the description of the gluing, hence the name. Two very important classes of examples are given by the Seifert bundles and the Solv manifolds. This leads to a more modern definition: a graph manifold is either a Solv manifold, a manifold having only Seifert pieces in its JSJ decomposition, or connect sums of the previous two categories. From this perspective, Waldhausen's article can be seen as the first breakthrough towards the discovery of JSJ decomposition. One of the numerous consequences of the Thurston-Perelman geometrization theorem is that graph manifolds are precisely the 3-manifolds whose Gromov norm vanishes.

Life and climb Before the stunt, Willig was a toymaker. At the time of the climb, 2 WTC was the third tallest building in the world, behind 1 WTC and the Sears Tower. It took Willig 3.5 hours to scale the tower. While the City of New York initially announced it would fine him $250,000 for \\"the inconvenience the stunt caused,\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndu1r4H8wUc&t;=3m45s New York City Mayor Abraham Beame fined him just $1.10, one cent for each of the skyscraper's 110 stories. Willig visited the World Trade Center a year before the stunt and took measurements for the equipment he would need. He made special clamps that fit into the window washing tracks of the South Tower. The clamps he designed would lock into place when they were pulled down by his body weight. They would release when he decided to raise them. Once he built the equipment, he went to the World Trade Center 4 to 5 times at night to test the equipment. He began his climb at 6:30 a.m. that Thursday morning. As he was climbing, two police officers, one a suicide expert, were lowered in a window washing basket to try to get Willig to give up. Willig swung away from the officers so they could not grab him. Willig and the officers talked, and the suicide expert realized that Willig knew what he was doing and was not a threat. The officer passed him a pen and paper, and Willig signed it \\"Best Wishes to my co-ascender.\\" Police helped him to the top of the tower, by pulling him through a tiny window hatch at 10:05 a.m. and he was arrested. Willig said he could hear the crowd cheering from ground level. His climb received plenty of attention because it took 3¬Ω hours to complete, allowing news cameras and spectators to gather. The only significant problem Willig ran into was irregularities in window washing tracks. However, he was prepared for this because he brought a small hammer to fix the irregularities. He signed his name and the date on a piece of metal on the observation deck of the South Tower, which was still visible until the tower was destroyed on September 11, 2001. The stunt paved the way for appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Good Morning America, The Merv Griffin Show, and ABC's Wide World of Sports. He also got jobs as a stuntman on The Six Million Dollar Man, Trauma Center, and Hollywood Beat' The Unisphere was climbed in 1976 by George Willig (the so-called \\"Human Fly\\" who would later climb the World Trade Center), and Jerry Hewitt as part of a short film called The Third Stone Directed by Paul Hornstein. In 1979, he published a book called Going It Alone (). During the 1990s, Willig lived in California's San Fernando Valley, working as a remodeler of commercial buildings. After the 9/11 attacks that destroyed both towers of the World Trade Center, Mr. Willig publicly said he regretted climbing the tower, as his actions may have brought them to the attention of terrorists. But he later told CNN that was just an initial, emotional reaction and that he was still glad to have climbed the tower.\\"America Remembers: The Significance of the World Trade Center\\".

Shri Kumbha Ram Arya was a member of Seventh Lok Sabha during 1980-84 representing Sikar Parliamentary constituency of Rajasthan. Earlier, he was a member of Rajya Sabha during 1960-64 and 1969-74. He had been a member of Rajasthan Legislative Assembly during 1952-57 and 1964‚Äì66 and also served as a Minister in the State Council of Ministers and held various portfolios. He was an agriculturist by profession and was an active social worker. During his long public life, he was actively involved in social, educational, and agrarian activities in his home State. As a prominent Kisan Leader, he worked hard towards creating consciousness among the local workers and pleasants and also authored the book titled Kisan Union Kyon. He was closely associated with many other organisations work for the establishment of Panchayat Raj and was the founder of Rajasthan Panchayat Raj Sangh. In princely states of Rajputana, which came into existence on 30 March 1949, the farmers were tenants of the land and their condition was deplorable under the exploitation of landlords called Jajirdars, Zamindars and Bishwedars etc. The tenant had no right over the land cultivated by him. He was only the tiller of the soil but was under the whimsical mercy of those landlords. But the farmers as a class were awakening in Bikaner state under the leadership of Chaudhary Kumbharam Arya and there was a turmoil of the tiller demanding, ‚ÄúLand to the tiller‚Äù. This hostile state of affairs led the newly formed state government to take the immediate steps to reconcile the situation. The pressure of protection of the tenants was so immense that the government had to take the immediate steps and with this aim ‚ÄúThe Rajasthan Protection of Tenants Ordinance, 1949‚Äù was promulgated to meet the burning need of the hour. The Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act, 1952 was the landmark in the legal history of land reforms in Rajasthan. The pressure of farmers united under the leadership of Chaudhary Kumbharam Arya forced the state government to promulgate The Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 which became applicable to the whole of Rajasthan. The overriding effect of this Act provided relief to the existing tenants and the rights accrued to tenants accordingly. He also amended the rules of felling trees in favour of farmers. Farmers were not allowed to fell trees from his land. This caused great difficulty. It was he who pressurized the state government to amend the rules and permit the farmer to fell trees from the land of his ownership for his use.

The R71 is used daily by people who work or reside in Dalmada, Mothiba, Nobody, Moria, Mankweng, Turfloop and Boyne. The road is well known to touring bikers who frequently visit the province from all other parts of the country, because of the scenic route through Magoebaskloof. Route The R71 begins at a junction with the R101 Route in Polokwane Central (Capital of Limpopo), just east of the R101's intersection with the R37 Route. As the R101 leaves the east-west road and becomes the road northwards, the R71 begins by taking over the two one-way-streets (Grobler Street eastwards from the R101 and Thabo Mbeki Street westwards to the R101). Going eastwards, it meets the south-western terminus of the R81 Route and just after, the two one-way streets become one road (Grobler Street) north of the suburb of Fauna Park. North of Polokwane Extension 28, the R71 meets the Polokwane Eastern Bypass (N1 National Route) before continuing eastwards to leave the city. From the N1 Interchange in Polokwane, the R71 goes eastwards for 51 kilometres, bypassing the University of Limpopo, through Moria, to the town of Haenertsburg, where it meets the western terminus of the R528 Route west of the Ebenezer Dam. The R528 is an alternative route as they both go north-east towards Tzaneen. At the R528 junction in Haenertsburg, the R71 becomes the Magoebaskloof Pass and continues north-east for 30 kilometres to reach a t-junction with the R36 Route. The R71 joins the R36 and they are one road southwards for 4 kilometres into the town of Tzaneen, crossing the Groot Letaba River west of the Tzaneen Dam, up to the next off-ramp junction, where they meet the eastern terminus of the R528 Route. As the R71 leaves the R36 Road and meets the R528 for the second time, it becomes the road eastwards (Wolkberg Drive). It passes through Tzaneen Central to cross the Groot Letaba River again. It goes eastwards for 24 kilometres to meet the R529 Route from Giyani north of Letsitele.

Winfield was born in Kansas, Oklahoma. His family relocated to California's San Joaquin Valley when he was 6 years old. This move was inspired by the \\"Okie migration\\" of the 1930s in which many midwest farming families, devastated by the Dust Bowl, headed west to California to start over. He was the Marlboro Man from 1968 until 1989. He is also credited with being the most portrayed man in the world by some. Philip Morris has used many cowboys for their ads but has declared that Winfield was \\"really the Marlboro man.\\" As an adult, Winfield moved to Wyoming and began ranching.

The Government Botanical Garden is a botanical garden in Udhagamandalam, near Coimbatore (Ooty), Tamil Nadu state, India laid out in 1848. The Gardens, divided into several sections, cover an area of around 55 hectares, and lie on the lower slopes of Doddabetta peak. The garden has a terraced layout. It is maintained by the Tamil Nadu Horticulture Department. It ascends the slopes of the hill at an elevation of 2250‚Äì2500 metres above Mean Sea Level. The garden enjoys a temperate climate, with an average rainfall of 140 cm, the most of which is received during south-west monsoon, with frosty nights from November to February. The maximum and minimum temperatures are 28¬∞C and 0¬∞C respectively.  History  The Government Botanical Garden, Udhagamandalm was established in 1848. Its architect was William Graham McIvor. The Marquis of Tweedale prepared the initial layout during the late 1840s. The gardens were established by a subscription of Rs 3 per month amongst the European residents for the purpose of supplying vegetables at a reasonable cost. During the time that Ootacamund was under British control, considerable cultivation of vegetables for the market was carried on by the European settlers and others. Captain Molyneux of the 2nd European Regiment managed the vegetable cultivation. The subscribers received vegetables free of cost. But this arrangement did not work out and in early 1847, a fund was raised by means of donations and subscriptions with a view to forming a horticultural society and a public garden. There were very few horticulturists at that time. Seeds and saplings were not available locally, but were available in nearby jungles. It was proposed to establish a public garden. For this purpose, a wood was selected between Lushington Hall (the Present Hebron School) and General Sewell‚Äôs Property (the present Raj Bhavan). Shortly after the formation of the society, the committee requested state aid for providing a scientific and practical gardener and funds to meet his salary. This suggestion was accepted and Mr.W.G.McIvor from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew was sent to Ootacamund by the East India Company. He arrived in March 1848, converted the upper portion, which was a forest, and the lower portion, which was a swamp, into a beautiful garden. He submitted a report at the end of 1848 to the East India Company in London., Report on the Ootacamund Gardens for 1848. He took ten years to complete the layout of the Garden.  Collections  The Gardens have around a thousand species, both exotic and indigenous, of plants, shrubs, ferns, trees, herbal and bonsai plants. In the centre of the Gardens lie a fossilized tree trunk estimated to be 20 million years old. The Gardens consist of several lawns with flowering plants, ponds with lilies, beds of flowers and ferns laid out in an Italian style, several plots of flowering plants, a variety of medicinal plants.  Sections  The present Botanical Gardens are divided into 6 sections namely Lower Garden, New Garden, Italian Garden, Conservatory, Fountain Terrace and Nurseries. = Lower Garden = Botanical Map of Indian States The lower garden comprises the entrance and the lower lawns. The entrance of the garden leads into an extensive lush green lawn of Kikiyu grass (Pennisetum Clandestinum) which is known for its springy vigour. A fern house with 127 species of ferns is situated on the left along the road leading to Raj Bhavan amidst another expanse of lawns and historic gatehouses. The prime attractions in this section are the carpet-bet design of the map of the Indian Union laid out with selective plants and the fossil trunk of 20 million years old, erected on a pedestal. Tree species of botanical interest such as Hymenosporum flavum, Cordyline australis, Cedrus deodara, Cupressus funebris, Araucaria bidwillii, Cupressus macrocarpa, Cryptomeria japonica, Eucalyptus maculata, Eucalyptus citriodora, Salix babylonica, Salix heterophylla, Podocarpus taxifolia, Dracaena lanuginosa, Pinus patula, Rhododendron arboreum, Quercus montana, Quercus cerris, Quercus serrata, Quercus griffithii, Quercus ilex, and Magnolia grandiflora can be seen alongside the lawn. = New Garden = The New garden developed recently, comprises the area between the front garden and the crescent-shaped pond at the bandstand. This section consists of: * A rose garden with three hundred varieties of hybrid tea roses, Floribunda and Polyanthas rose varieties. * Large number of flowerbeds designed to match the slopes and contour of this area. * Carpet-bed emblems of the Government of Tamil Nadu and the Government of India. * Natural ponds with aquatic plants. Important tree species such as Taxodium mucronatum, Pieris ovalifolia, Juniperus virginiana, Eucalyptus eugenioides, Pinus wallichiana, Photinia lindleyana, Pinus canariensils, Ginkgo biloba, Araucaria cunninghamii and Cupressus lawsoniana are planted all over the section. = Italian Garden = This garden was first laid out by Italian prisoners of World War I, who were shifted to Ooty. They were placed under the control of the Military station in Ootacamund. Asters, ageratum, balsam, begonia, petunia, pansy, phlox, cosmos, zinnia and perennial flowers like salvia, delphinium, larkspur, and dahlia are the main attraction in this garden. The informal landscape of the garden from the entrance, merge into the formal fashioned beds laid out in an Italian pattern, surrounding the centrally situated octagonal bandstand. This part of the garden looks attractive with several varieties of colourful annuals. In the foreground, is a crescent-shaped lily pond for growing several varieties of aquatic plant species. The tree species grown in this part of the garden are Prunus cerasoides, Saurauja nepaulensis, Grevillea hilliana, Aesculus punduana, Pinus sabineana, Cupressus torulosa, Syncarpia glomulifera, Pinus roxburghii, Albizzia julibrissin etc. = The Conservatory = The public conservatory was constructed in 1912 with the objective of grouping various flowering plants. Colourful annuals and perennials like Cineraria, Schizanthus, Calceolaria, Balsam, Cyclamen, Gloxinia, Tuberous begonia, Coleus, Geranium, Chrysanthemum, Primulas, Tydea, Achemenes etc., find a place in this conservatory. The bog garden lies towards the east of this conservatory and forms an adjunct to provide a good site for marsh loving plants such as the Weeping willow, Hedychium, Arum, Hydrangea etc. = The Nurseries = The nurseries which are about 300 feet above the lower lawns, consist of eight glass-houses and a series of terraces for introduction and breeding of exotic plants. The glass- houses are utilized for growing Begonias, Ferns, Cacti, Succulents, Orchids and Bulbous plants for providing a continuous supply of potted plants to be grouped periodically in the conservatories. The terraces are utilised for growing plants for cut flowers, seed and also for trial purposes.  The Flower Show  The first Flower Show was organised in the year 1896 by the Chairman of Nilgiris Agri-Horticultural Society, Mr.J.H.Tremenhere, the then Collector of Nilgiris. The Government has taken over the flower show from the Nilgiris Agri-horticultural society in 1980 by forming a committee called the Nilgiris Flower and Fruit Show Committee. The flower show attracts about 150,000 tourists each year from all over the world. The flower show is held for two days. The inauguration of the show is held on the first day and on the second day, prizes are distributed to winners of various competitions held in connection with flower show. About 250 exhibitors participate in different categories on the day of flower show. Several government departments and voluntary agencies also display their activities for the benefits of the flower lovers and tourists. More than 50 varieties of potted plants, 150 varieties of cut flowers, various kinds of tropical and temperate vegetables and tropical and temperate fruits are exhibited by the competitors. The Floral decorations, Indian and Japanese flower arrangements, Vegetable carving, Flower Rangoli, Bonsai etc., are the major attractions during the show days. The exclusive cut flower stalls from large private and public gardens are also an attraction during the show days. 59 rolling cups, 250 cups and cash prizes are awarded to the best competitors and exhibitors. A garden competition is also held involving Estate Gardens, Private Cottage Gardens, Public Gardens and various other categories of gardens, to create greater awareness among flower growers. On an average, about 200 gardens compete in the event. Garden competition is held prior to the flower show and best gardens are awarded prizes and cups.  The Fossil Tree Trunk  The fossil tree trunk displayed in the garden is from 20 million years old. Trees carried by rivers and deposited in inland lakes were transformed with replacement of the woody matter by silica give rise to fossil tree trunks (see Polystrate fossil). The fossil tree was presented by the Geological Survey of India, from the National Fossil Park, Tiruvakkarai, South Arcot district, Tamil Nadu.  Arboretum  Arboretum is defined as living collections of trees and other woody plants. The area of the arboretum is 1.58 ha. which was established during the year 1992 and maintained by Department of Horticulture with Hill Area Development Programme funds and it is situated near the lake, Udhagai. It was established with an aim of conserving native and indigenous trees. The micro watershed area leading to ooty lake was neglected and the feeder line feeding water to Ooty was contaminated with urban waste and agricultural chemicals. The area is the natural habitats of both indigenous and migratory birds. to conserve flora and fauna of the Nilgiri, the area was developed into the Arboretum. During the year 2005-2006, it was rehabilitated by the funds provided by the Hill Area Development Programme to the tune of 12.50 lakhs by providing permanent fencing, food path and other infrastructure facilities. Various indigenous and exotic tree species of are grown in arboretum and conserved. About 80 trees have been planted in the arboretum. The different type of tree species planted in arboretum are Alnus nepalensis, Calistemon lanceolatus, Cupressus macrocarpa, Eugenia apiculata, Hypericum hookerianum, Podocarpus elongata, Populus deltoids, Quercus macrocarpa Salix babylonica, Taxodium mucronatum, Prunus pissardii etc. In order to add some more species to the arboretum the following tree species were also planted: Celtis tetrandra, Dillenia pentagyna, Elaeocarpres ferrugineus, Elaeocarpres oblongus, Evodia lunuankenda, Glochidion neilgherrense, Ligustrum perrotetti, Litsaea ligustrina, Litsaea wightiana, Meliosma arnotiana, Meliosma wightii, Michelia champaca, Michelia nilagirica, Pygeum gardneri, Syzygium amothanum, Syzygium montanum, Alnus nepalensis, Viburnum erubescens, Podocarpus wallichianus, Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, Rapanea wightiana, Ternstroemia japonica, Microtropis microcarpa, Psychotria congesta, Photinea notoniana, Cedrela toona, Symplocos cochinchinensis, Elaeocarpus ganitrus, Platanus orientalis, Jacaranda mimosaefolia, and Magnolia grandiflora  The Toda Mund  The Garden is also famous for the Toda hill called the Toda mund.

It is designated a Natural Area, rather than a State Park, which means the primary focus is the maintenance and protection of the property's natural state. Accordingly, access and recreational activities may be restricted if the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department (TPWD) deems such action necessary to protect the environment.  Location  The Lost Maples State Natural Area is located about north of Vanderpool, Texas and northwest of San Antonio. The preserve sits along the Sabinal River in western Bandera County and far eastern Real County.  History  The land for Lost Maples State Natural Area was acquired by the state of Texas in 1973 and 1974, and was opened to the public in 1979. In 1980, the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service made the Natural Area a National Natural Landmark. Humans have inhabited this area since prehistoric times. The recorded history of the area, beginning with Spanish explorations in the 17th century, identifies a number of Indian groups, including the Apache, Lipan Apache and Comanche as having foraged, hunted, and occasionally lived in this part of the Texas Hill Country.  Geology  Much of the area's limestone bedrock is exposed on elevated terrain, which has a shallow, discontinuous cover of dark gray stony clay (Eckrant series). Most valley bottoms have deep, dark brown silty clay (Krum series) or clay loam (Pratley series). Deposits of gravel, sand, and loam (Orif-Boerne association) lie within a few hundred feet of the Sabinal River. All of these soils have free calcium carbonate throughout their profiles and are moderately alkaline. Despite a high clay content in most cases, poorly drained soils are too inextensive to be mapped.  Fauna  As in much of the Hill Country, white- tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are by far the most common large mammal on the property. Additionally, wild turkeys, armadillos, skunks, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, and fox squirrels are present. Feral pigs, exotic axis deer, porcupines, rock squirrels, and ringtails may occasionally be encountered. Bobcats, coyotes, both red and grey foxes, and rarely, mountain lions, also inhabit the general area, but are seldom seen by visitors. Bird life, including several different raptors, is particularly abundant and diverse throughout the year. Venomous snakes include the copperhead and coral.http://www.moderntexasnaturalist.com/?p=840https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g56816-d109386-i51165593-Lost_Maples_State_Natural_Area- Vanderpool_Bandera_County_Texas.html The Sabinal River maintains surface water even during exceptional drought (as in 2011), so fish and other aquatic animals are always present.  Flora  Primary vegetation includes the Ashe juniper (often called mountain cedar), several different species of oak, and also bigtooth maple (not a verified presence in Real Countyhttp://bonap.net/TDC/Image/Map?taxonType=Species&taxonId;=22739&locationType;=County&mapType;=Normalhttp://bonap.net/TDC/Image/Map?taxonType=Species&taxonId;=30528&locationType;=County&mapType;=FalseReport), sycamore, mesquite, Texas persimmon, Texas mountain-laurel, Texas madrone, redbud, wild grape, prickly pear, and various types of brush, grasses, and ferns. Bigtooth Maple colors are brilliant if autumn is droughty, or has cold nights, but are muted in a mild, damp autumn. Texas red oak gives a fine crimson display almost every year and may retain its leaves well into winter. The Natural Area is most crowded when the fall colors peak in late October- early November. Evidence suggests that the maple trees that give the preserve its name are relics: remnants of a larger, more widespread population that flourished during the cooler and wetter climate of the last glacial period. Today, their distribution is limited by the relative rarity of the soils and microclimates they require to thrive. A more extensive list of the preserve's fauna and flora can be found at the LMSNA Ranger Station.  Recreation  Lost Maples is a State Natural Area and therefore has been developed only enough to provide access to visitors, while still protecting its natural character. The reserve contains of hiking trails, 30 campsites, and eight primitive camping areas. In the center of the park are two small lakes along Can Creek. The Texas Parks & Wildlife Department urges all visitors to respect the Leave No Trace set of wilderness ethics... 1) Plan Ahead and Prepare, 2) Travel on Marked Trails Only, 3) Always Dispose of Waste Properly, 4) Leave Behind What You Find, 5) Never Build An Open Fire, 6) Respect All Wildlife, and 7) Be Considerate of Other Visitors. Please do your part by following this code, and protecting the park's sensitive natural and cultural resources.

Diamond, Denner and Hansen had recently departed the group Mercyful Fate, and decided to form a new band under the King Diamond moniker, as it was already known from the Mercyful Fate days. In 1986, King Diamond released their debut album Fatal Portrait. Since then the band have released a total of twelve studio albums (most of them concept albums), two live albums, two extended plays, five compilations and five singles. Since the band's inception, there have been over fifteen musicians in and out of King Diamond, with the only two mainstays being vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Andy LaRocque. In 1987 the band released their second studio release Abigail (their first concept album). Throughout the 1980s, King Diamond released a total of four studio albums. After their fifth album The Eye (1990), the band was put on hold when King Diamond reunited with his former outfit Mercyful Fate. After reforming King Diamond in 1994, Diamond would balance recording and touring with both Mercyful Fate and his eponymous band throughout the 1990s. Since the early 2000s, King Diamond have kept recording and touring and, since 2014, the band has been composed of vocalist King Diamond, guitarist Andy LaRocque, guitarist Mike Wead, drummer Matt Thompson, and bassist Pontus Egberg. History =Formation to Abigail (1985‚Äì1987)= The band was formed in 1985 by vocalist King Diamond, guitarist Michael Denner, and bassist Timi Hansen. The three had recently departed from the group Mercyful Fate, which fell apart due to musical differences between King Diamond and guitarist Hank Shermann. According to Diamond, when he, Denner, and Hansen decided to form a new band, they chose the name \\"King Diamond\\" to \\"get better deals\\", and because the name was already known from Mercyful Fate. To round-out the line-up of the King Diamond band, the group chose drummer Mikkey Dee and guitarist Andy LaRocque. In July 1985, the band began recording their debut album at Sound Track Studio in Copenhagen, Denmark. On 25 December, they released their debut single \\"No Presents for Christmas\\". Fatal Portrait, the band's first full-length studio album, was released on 17 February 1986, through Roadrunner Records. Produced by Rune H√∂yer and vocalist King Diamond, the album charted at number 33 on the Swedish album chart, and spawned the single \\"Halloween\\", which was released on 6 June 1986. In December 1986, King Diamond began recording their second studio album, once again at Sound Track Studio in Copenhagen, Denmark. The band released the single \\"The Family Ghost\\" on 1 July 1987, for which they also shot their first music video. On 15 June 1987, King Diamond released the album Abigail, their first concept album based on an original story by vocalist King Diamond. The album went on to chart at number 39 in Sweden, number 68 in the Netherlands, and at number 123 on the Billboard 200. Following Abigail's release, guitarist Michael Denner left the band due to touring strains. He was subsequently replaced by Mike Moon for the album's supporting tour, during which the band recorded the live album In Concert 1987: Abigail (however it wasn't released until 1991). =\\"Them\\" and Conspiracy (1988‚Äì1989)= Following the completion of the Abigail tour, guitarist Mike Moon and bassist Timi Hansen were replaced by Pete Blakk and Hal Patino respectively. On 13 September 1988, King Diamond released the album \\"Them\\", which was recorded at M.M.C. Studio in Copenhagen, Denmark. Another concept album, \\"Them\\" charted at number 38 on the Swedish album chart, number 65 on the Dutch album chart, and at number 89 on the Billboard 200, making \\"Them\\" King Diamond's highest charting album in America to date. Another music video was also shot, this time for the single \\"Welcome Home\\". On 1 November, the group released The Dark Sides EP, a collection of previously released material as well as one unreleased track. Following the completion of the supporting tour for \\"Them\\", Mikkey Dee left King Diamond. However, he was rehired to play drums on the band's follow-up album, after which he was replaced by Snowy Shaw. On 21 August 1989, King Diamond released the album Conspiracy, which charted at number 41 on the Swedish album chart, number 64 on the Dutch album chart, and at number 111 on the Billboard 200. A continuation of the storyline from \\"Them\\", Conspiracy was the first King Diamond album recorded in the United States being recorded at Rumbo Recording Studios in Canoga Park, California. A music video was also made for the track \\"Sleepless Nights\\". =The Eye to House of God (1990‚Äì2000)= In June 1990, King Diamond began recording fifth studio album The Eye at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was released on 30 October 1990. The drums on the album were performed by drummer Snowy Shaw using drum pads. It debuted at number 179 on the Billboard 200. However, the band did not tour in support of the album due to the lack of label support. Following The Eye, Hal Patino and Pete Blakk were replaced by Sharlee D'Angelo and Mike Wead respectively. However this line-up ended-up not recording any material, as vocalist King Diamond reunited with Mercyful Fate in 1993 (King Diamond would balance recording and touring with both Mercyful Fate and his eponymous band throughout the 1990s). After recording and touring with Mercyful Fate, King Diamond reformed his eponymous band in 1994. With the line-up of King Diamond, Andy La Rocque, as well as guitarist Herb Simonsen, bassist Chris Estes and drummer Darrin Anthony from the Texas band Mindstorm, the band spent September through October 1994, recording their next album. Released on 6 June 1995, The Spider's Lullabye was the band's first album on Metal Blade Records, as well as their first studio release since Fatal Portrait to not be a concept album. The album went on to peak at number 31 on the Finnish album charts. In March 1996, King Diamond began recording their seventh studio album at the Dallas Sound Lab. Released on 1 October 1996, The Graveyard saw King Diamond returning to writing concept albums. The album also charted at number 23 in Finland. After the album's release, drummer Darrin Anthony was forced to leave the band due to a car accident and was subsequently replaced by Chastain drummer John Luke Hebert. On 24 February 1998, King Diamond released the album Voodoo, which charted at number 27 on the Finnish album chart and at number 55 on the Swedish album chart. After the album's release, guitarist Herb Simonsen was replaced by Glen Drover. When Mercyful Fate was put on hold in 1999, King Diamond began recording the album House of God at the Nomad Recording Studio in Carrollton, Dallas, Texas, with their new bassist Paul David Harbour, who had replaced Chris Estes. Released on 20 June 2000, the album peaked at number 60 in Sweden. After the album's release, guitarist Glen Drover and drummer John Luke Hebert were replaced by Mike Wead and Matt Thompson respectively. =Later years (2001‚Äì2017)= King Diamond performing in Krak√≥w, 2001 In May 2001, King Diamond began recording their tenth studio album once again at the Nomad Recording Studio. Released on 29 January 2002, Abigail II: The Revenge was a sequel to 1987's Abigail album. It was also the first King Diamond album since 1990's The Eye to feature bassist Hal Patino who rejoined the band during the recording process. King Diamond did not tour in support of Abigail II, as Metal Blade could not provide tour support, due to illegal downloading. Despite this, the album went on to peak at number 24 in Finland and at number 42 in Sweden. On 21 October 2003, King Diamond released the album The Puppet Master, which charted at number 36 in Sweden. Besides featuring the band, the album also featured additional vocals from Livia Zita, who is also King Diamond's wife. During the supporting tour for The Puppet Master, the band recorded the live album Deadly Lullabyes, which was released 21 September 2004. In April 2006, former bandmate Mikkey Dee (currently with Scorpions, formerly with Mot√∂rhead) made a guest appearance at King Diamond's sold-out gig in Gothenburg, Sweden. On 26 June 2007, King Diamond released the album Give Me Your Soul...Please. The album went on to peak at number 25 on the Finnish chart, number 28 on the Swedish chart, and at number 174 on the Billboard 200. The track \\"Never Ending Hill\\" also garnered a Grammy nomination for \\"Best Metal Performance\\" (the group's first). A music video was also made for the album's title track. King Diamond (left) and Andy LaRocque (right) performing in Moscow, 2006 In late November 2010, King Diamond was rushed to the hospital after having several heart attacks. There it was discovered that three of his arteries had been blocked, which meant he had to undergo triple bypass surgery. Following a successful operation, he returned home to rest. Diamond also stopped smoking entirely, changed his diet and began getting regular exercise, according to his wife. On 27 January 2012, Diamond made a special appearance at the \\"5th Annual Nomad Recording Studio Throwdown\\", performing three songs: \\"The Family Ghost\\", \\"Evil\\" and \\"Burn\\". On 9 June 2012, the entire King Diamond band played at the Sweden Rock Festival. They were also joined on stage by Michael Denner, Hank Shermann, Mickey Dee and Volbeat's Michael Poulsen. Vocalist King Diamond stated that the band was expected to begin writing new material for their thirteenth studio album in the fall of 2012. On 19 July 2014, the band announced that Hal Patino has been relieved of his duties, for reasons very similar to why he was fired from the band in 1990. He was replaced by Pontus Egberg, formerly of the bands Lion's Share and the Poodles. In October, King Diamond announced a new compilation titled Dreams of Horror which was released in November through Metal Blade Records, covering the band's entire career. In December, Egberg became an official member of the band. King Diamond took part in the 2015 Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival along with bands such as Slayer (who was chosen as the headliner), Hellyeah, The Devil Wears Prada, Thy Art Is Murder, Jungle Rot, Sister Sin, Sworn In, Shattered Sun, Feed Her to the Sharks, Code Orange and Kissing Candice. The tour ran from 26 June through 2 August. At the 8 July 2015 show in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, King Diamond was forced to perform without his signature face paint due to a severe eye infection, in which doctors advised against the use of any makeup. He said that there was no negative feedback from the fans. The band then embarked on a special tour from October to December 2015 with thrash metal band Exodus, where the 1987 album Abigail was performed in its entirety. =The Institute (2018‚Äìpresent)= In 2018, King Diamond started work on the thirteenth studio album, which would be divided into two parts to connect with its theme. The first part of the series was later revealed to be titled The Institute. It was planned to be released in 2020 with a North American tour taking place in the fall of 2019; its release date was later pushed back to 2021. The first single from the album, \\"Masquerade of Madness\\", was made available for streaming on 8 November 2019. On 25 January 2019, the first ever live video Songs for the Dead Live was released.

He was the only surviving son of King Frederick V by his second wife, Juliana Maria of Braunschweig-Wolfenb√ºttel. Hereditary Prince Frederick acted as regent on behalf of his half-brother King Christian VII from 1772 to 1784. Life Frederick was born at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen on 11 October 1753. To provide for his future position, at the age of 3 he was elected coadjutor in the Prince-Bishopric of L√ºbeck. This meant that in time he would succeed the Prince-Bishop then in office, Frederick August. This plan had to be abandoned, however, and Frederick stayed in Denmark as a junior member of the royal family. =Marriage= He married Duchess Sophia Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1758‚Äì1794) in Copenhagen on 21 October 1774. She was a daughter of Duke Louis of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Princess Charlotte Sophie of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. =Regent of the kingdoms= Hereditary Prince Frederick, Regent of the Kingdoms by Vigilius Eriksen. His elder half-brother, King Christian VII, suffering from a severe mental illness (believed to have been schizophrenia), and having been divorced from his wife, Caroline Matilda of Great Britain (who was then exiled), Prince Frederick was designated as regent of Denmark-Norway in 1772, when 18 years old. His regency was mostly nominal, the power being held by his mother, Queen Juliane Marie, and minister Ove H√∏egh-Guldberg. He acted as regent until the coup of 1784, when his 16-year-old half-nephew Frederick (the future King Frederick VI), took power and regency. =Later life= Hereditary Prince Frederick in 1790. After the coup, Frederick was left without much influence at the court. After Christiansborg Palace was destroyed by fire in 1794, Hereditary Prince Frederick moved with his family to Amalienborg Palace. Sophia Frederica died the same year, shortly after the move. Hereditary Prince Frederick outlived his wife by 11 years and died at Amalienborg Palace on 7 December 1805. Eventually, his son Christian Frederick would succeed Frederick VI as king. In Literature Prince Frederick is an important character in Norah Lofts' historical novel The Lost Queen (1969), chronicling the tragic marriage of King Christian VII and Queen Caroline Matilda. The book suggests that Frederick was himself in love with the Queen and jealous of her lover Johann Friedrich Struensee ‚Äì which is not firmly attested in historical sources.

While football has moved around the world from its roots in England during the 18th century, the progress of non-European players has sometimes been hindered, with racism a continuing problem in many different countries. People of different races have sometimes not been accepted as players in European football. This has changed in recent times, due to societal change as well as campaigning on the part of the football authorities in different countries. UEFA and the European Union support the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) project which aims to stop racism. Globalization Globalisation has created a sense of homogenised culture in football where players from different ethnic backgrounds have congregated in one particular team. This enables the team to form some kind of \\"supranational\\" (Maguire J, 2009) entity that in turns loses its local or national identity but gains a mixture of strengths that ideally improves the team's performance. A good example of this are the teams associated to the Premier League based in England. All of these teams are made up of players from different ethnic groups and are considered the best players in the World. Manchester United were crowned FIFA Club World Cup Champions in 2008, which exemplified the importance of ethnic diversity in a team - only three of the players in their championship game were of English background. Globalisation has also affected football from a different perspective. John Nauright (2004) explains that during the globalisation process, local and national identity is celebrated especially during significant sporting events such as the Football World Cup. An estimated 715.1 million people from different countries and ultimately ethnic backgrounds watched the Football World Cup in 2006 which makes it the most viewed event in history. This results in businesses looking for opportunities to advertise their brand through sponsorship and funding which leads to commercialism in football. Commercialism In 1992, Rupert Murdoch and British Sky Broadcasting purchased the rights to televise the English FA Premier League for 304 million English pounds which was 600% more than the previous contract.T Slack, 2004 The Commercialisation of Sport, pg 10. Taylor & Francis Group Retrieved from URL: https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd7ieYncwxIC&pg;=PR29 Feeding off the passionate interest for football, matches were televised all over the world through satellite television which made the league the \\"crown jewel\\" of football. Since then aspiring players from different ethnic backgrounds have strived to play in this league to achieve fame, money and satisfaction of reaching a defining peak in football excellence. Sales and revenue through advertising and technology have been determining factors in the commercialisation of football which has resulted in the globalisation of the sport. The main reason for sport organisations adopting the business model is to ensure their financial sustainability for the future. In order to gain a larger market share of audiences, well known football players from different countries who have loyal local fans are recruited. An example of this is Liverpool Football Club in the Premier League recruiting Fernando Torres from Spain where he played for a local club and had many supporters. This caused the loyal supporters to change allegiances as a sign of support for their player. This has in turn increased the ethnic diversity within the sporting code but also brought to attention the apparent racism associated among the players. Early football (1880‚Äì1960) In several countries, black players were often harassed by spectators; stories of players being pelted with racial slurs, chants, and even bananas were quite commonplace, although there had been black players playing in Europe since the early days of football. Andrew Watson, an amateur player, was capped for Scotland three times in the early 1880s, and played in the Scottish Cup for Queen's Park.Arthur Wharton, who played for Preston North End and Sheffield United, amongst others, is recognised as the world's first black professional footballer. Jack Leslie was the first black player to be selected for England, but never actually played for his country ‚Äì which is thought to be due to the colour of his skin. Frank Soo was the first (and so far only) ethnic Chinese person to play for England, during the Second World War, though these were not official internationals. Other non-white footballers in Britain in the early and mid-20th century included Eddie Parris, a black Welsh international; Mohammed Abdul Salim, an Indian playing for Celtic; Tewfik Abdullah, an Egyptian who played for Derby County; the Jamaican Lindy Delapenha, who won a title with Portsmouth before moving to Middlesbrough; his countryman Gil Heron, who played for Celtic; and Charlie Williams, a British black defender for Doncaster Rovers who later became a successful entertainer. Modern football (1960 onwards) It was not until Viv Anderson that black footballers started to become accepted into the England national football team. Since then, many black players have played for England, and several have served as captain, notably Paul Ince, John Barnes and Sol Campbell. Nowadays in the bigger leagues minority players have become part of football, and are supported. This was seen in the French football team which won the 1998 World Cup. The team was composed of white and black Frenchmen including immigrants from or descendants of several countries/colonies such as Argentina (David Trezeguet), Senegal (Patrick Vieira), French Guiana (Bernard Lama), Martinique (Thierry Henry), Guadeloupe (Lilian Thuram, Bernard Diom√®de), Ghana (Marcel Desailly), plus a New Caledonian (Christian Karembeu); the whites also included an ethnic Armenian and Kalmyk (Youri Djorkaeff), another player of Armenian descent (Alain Boghossian), a Basque (Bixente Lizarazu), a Breton (Stephane Guivarc'h), Robert Pires whose parents hail from Portugal and Spain, and an ethnic Berber (Zinedine Zidane). This composition was seen as an indicator of racial harmony, in a country where race and immigration has been and still remains a source of tension and conflict. Incidents in 2004 have also shown this to be the case in some bigger leagues, where there are a visible number of players from a different ethnicity. A notable incident occurred that year when England played Spain in Madrid, and home fans were heard by the world media to be making \\"monkey chants\\" at some of the black players on the pitch, forcing the Spanish football authorities to apologise for their fans. On November 27, 2005, Marc Zoro, a player from C√¥te d'Ivoire, was playing for the Italian team Messina when he was racially abused by Inter Milan fans to the extent that he picked up the ball and threatened to leave the field. This caused the Italian football authorities to propose to start the following week's matches late after an anti-racism display. This came at the same time that European Union legislators were threatening Europe-wide legal sanctions against national football associations and clubs whose fans were seen to take part in racist actions. Australia Ethnic minorities were instrumental in establishing the National Soccer League, which lasted from 1977 to 2004 as Australia's top- flight competition; however, clubs such as South Melbourne, Sydney Olympic, Sydney United, Adelaide City and Marconi were met with a policy established by League head David Hill to cut ties with their ethnicity. Names such as \\"Hellas\\", \\"Croatia\\" and \\"Juventus\\" were removed from clubs in an attempt to draw new supporters from outside of these ethnic groups, but falling attendances and financial difficulties caused the NSL to be disbanded and eighteen months later, the A-League was launched with a rule forbidding no clubs to have ethnic ties, and several teams, such as Melbourne Victory and Central Coast Mariners, were newly created. Almost all of the old NSL powerhouses are now dominating their respective state leagues and the Football Australia's ethnic banning policy was recently overtuned on the basis of being discriminatory. Religion in football Sometimes certain clubs have often been connected with religious denominations, such as both Tottenham Hotspur and Ajax with Judaism, or the Old Firm Rangers F.C. and Celtic F.C. of Glasgow, who are seen to be Protestant and Roman Catholic respectively. This has led to problems with violence and occasionally death, but often equates to little more than derogatory nicknames. 'Oriental' footballers Players of Oriental origin have had presence in European football. Hong Y 'Frank' Soo played 9 times for England during the Second World War. Sammy Chung coached Wolverhampton Wanderers to a UEFA Cup Final in 1972, and later as manager helped lead them to promotion from the old 2nd division to the old 1st division. Vikash Dhorasoo, of Indo-Mauritian descent, played for the French national team during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. South Korean Park Ji-Sung, who played for Manchester United, is an example of an Asian footballer who can be a rising star in big clubs in Europe. Park may be preceded by the Japanese player Hidetoshi Nakata, who played at various European clubs such as Perugia, AS Roma, Parma, Bologna, Fiorentina and lately at Bolton Wanderers. Another Japanese player, Shunsuke Nakamura, overcame criticism of his lack of pace and stamina, and helped seal Celtic FC's 2006-2007 Scottish Premier League season title. The most prominent example of an Asian player having a successful career in a big European League in the 20th century was Cha Bum-Kun, a Korean striker who played for Darmstadt, Frankfurt and Leverkusen in the German league, scoring 98 goals in 308 matches in Germany. He was later given the title Asia's Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics. Other Korean, Iranian, Chinese and Japanese football players have also gained starting places in their respective clubs in Europe. Some football clubs hire the Asian football stars hoping to increase merchandise sales from the player's respective Asian country. However, in Britain in 2007, there were complaints of a lack of Asian participants in top league football.Sunday Times, 2007-01-14, Joe Lovejoy, \\"Where are the Asian players?\\" See also Racism in association football * Racism * Football Against Racism in Europe References External links http://www.vasili.co.uk * http://www.farenet.org * http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,6903,1476285,00.html - Guardian article on Lucas Radebe, with a timeline on black players in British football * http://www.jewishcomment.com/cgibin/news.cgi?id=12&command;=shownews&newsid;=856 - Chas Newkey-Burden's article on anti-Semitism in British football * https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/21/manchester-united-quito-club- world-cup-rooney-vidic Association football culture ","title":"Ethnicity and association football"},{"id":"1857508","text":"Piero Gobetti, c. 1920 Piero Gobetti (; June 19, 1901, Turin ‚Äì February 15, 1926, Neuilly-sur-Seine) was an Italian journalist, intellectual and radical liberal and anti-fascist. He was an exceptionally active campaigner and critic in the crisis years in Italy after the First World War and into the early years of Fascist rule.  Biography  A student of law at the University of Turin, he set up his own review Energie Nove ('New Energies') in 1918. There he promoted the cause of radical cultural and political renewal, aligning himself with the many critics of liberal parliamentary politics. Drawing upon the idealist philosophy of Benedetto Croce, Gobetti identified cultural change with a spiritual transformation that would unite public and private life. He also attached himself to causes such as educational reform and votes for women led by the independent deputy, Gaetano Salvemini. In 1920, Gobetti was influenced by Antonio Gramsci, fellow ex-student and Communist editor of the L'Ordine Nuovo ('New Order'). Gramsci was the leading intellectual during the proletarian unrest in Turin in 1919‚Äì1920 which led to the factory occupations in September 1920. Inspired by the workers' movement and Gramsci's argument that they constituted a new revolutionary subject, Gobetti gave up editing Energie Nove in order to rethink his commitments. In 1922, he began publishing a new review, La Rivoluzione Liberale (\\"Liberal Revolution\\"). Here he expounded a distinctive version of liberalism, conceived as a philosophy of liberation rather than a party doctrine. Deeply moved by the Russian Revolution, which he understood as a liberal event, Gobetti conceived the working class as the leading subject of a liberal revolution. In seeking to take over the factories and govern themselves, he argued, the workers expressed a desire for autonomy and collective freedom that could renew Italy. Liberals, Gobetti argued, should understand the term 'liberal' as adaptable to different classes and institutional arrangements other than the bourgeoisie and parliamentary democracy. Resistance leader Ada Gobetti was his wife and contributed to La Rivoluzione Liberale as well as other magazines. Gobetti was also highly attentive to the dangers of Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party, which entered government in October, 1922. Whilst conservative liberals hoped to make temporary use of Mussolini's popularity in order to restore parliament, Gobetti recognised the tyrannical orientation of fascism. He claimed fascism represented the 'autobiography of the nation', an accretion of all the ills of Italian society. In particular, fascism continued a political tradition of compromise, absorbing political opponents rather than allowing conflict to express itself openly. Liberalism, he argued, was anti-fascist insofar as, on his account, it recognised that liberty was achieved through struggle and conflict. In late 1924, Gobetti also began to edit a journal of European literary culture entitled Il Baretti. He used the journal to put into practice his idea of liberal anti-fascism and his conviction that the Italian people could learn to reject the insular nature of fascist culture by means of an education in European culture. For his rigid opposition to Fascism, Gobetti's review was closed down and he himself was assaulted by fascist thugs. He was beaten up in 1925 and escaped to Paris early the next year. He died there in February, 1926. He is buried in the Pere Lachaise cemetery. Following his death and despite his relatively few writings, Gobetti became a symbol of liberal anti-fascism, inspiring intellectuals such as Carlo Levi and Norberto Bobbio.

The purpose of the grease gun is to apply lubricant through an aperture to a specific point, usually from a grease cartridge to a grease fitting or 'nipple'. The channels behind the grease nipple lead to where the lubrication is needed. The aperture may be of a type that fits closely with a receiving aperture on any number of mechanical devices. The close fitting of the apertures ensures that lubricant is applied only where needed. There are four types of grease gun: #Hand-powered, where the grease is forced from the aperture by back-pressure built up by hand-cranking the trigger mechanism of the gun, which applies pressure to a spring mechanism behind the lubricant, thus forcing grease through the aperture. #Hand-powered, where there is no trigger mechanism, and the grease is forced through the aperture by the back-pressure built up by pushing on the butt of the grease gun, which slides a piston through the body of the tool, pumping grease out of the aperture. #Air-powered (pneumatic), where compressed air is directed to the gun by hoses, the air pressure serving to force the grease through the aperture. Russell Gray, inventor of the air-powered grease gun, founded Graco based on this invention. #Electric, where an electric motor drives a high pressure grease pump. These are often battery-powered for portability. The grease gun is charged or loaded with any of the various types of lubricants, but usually a thicker heavier type of grease is used. It was a close resemblance to contemporary hand-powered grease guns that gave the nickname to the World War II-era M3 submachine gun.

Had he lived five months longer, he would have outlived his nephew, King Frederick VII, and become King of Denmark. Early life Prince Ferdinand was born at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen on 22 November 1792 as the youngest child of Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway and Sophie Frederikke of Mecklenburg, thus being a grandson of late King Frederick V of Denmark and Norway. His uncle King Christian VII being mentally unstable, his father had acted as regent after the fall of Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1772. But after the coup of 1784, when the king's son Crown Prince Frederick took power and regency, Hereditary Prince Frederick had been without influence at the court. However, Crown Prince Frederick being without male heirs, Hereditary Prince Frederick and his sons were in the immediate line of succession to the throne. When Christiansborg Palace was destroyed by fire in 1794, the young Prince and his family moved to Amalienborg Palace where he was brought up, spending the summers at Sorgenfri Palace. Marriage Prince Ferdinand married at Frederiksberg Palace on 1 August 1829 his first cousin once removed, Princess Caroline of Denmark (1793‚Äì1881). She was the eldest daughter of the above-mentioned sonless Crown Prince Frederick, now King Frederick VI of Denmark. When Frederick VI died in 1839, because of the Salic Law Caroline did not succeed to the throne, which was inherited by the closest male relative, Ferdinand's elder brother Prince Christian Frederick. Later life The number of male members of the Royal House was so low in those decades that Ferdinand himself was always very close to the succession. At the death of his brother Christian VIII in 1848, the aged Ferdinand became heir presumptive. Ferdinand died childless, which was one of the reasons why the main branch of the Danish Royal House soon became extinct, triggering the second war of Schleswig.

Aalto Media Lab is a transdisciplinary laboratory and studio focusing on digital design and its impact to culture and society. The Lab is part of the Department of Media at the School of Arts, Design and Architecture, Aalto University in Finland. Media Lab is a platform for MA and Doctoral studies, and for research on design and production of digital culture, digital media, interaction design, new media art and technologies and the effect they have on society. The Lab is a coordinator and a partner in number of international research, design and development projects focusing on digital technology, art, design, media and culture.  History  Media Lab was founded in 1993. The first MA program was started in 1994 and the first research group assembled in 1996. The roots of the Media Lab are in the early Scandinavian media art, demoscene, game design, hacker culture, and participatory design communities. Since its formation the Media Lab has been part of a relatively active digital culture scene in Helsinki and its surroundings. Since 1995 Media Lab has collaborated in, generated and coordinated research and development projects funded by the European Commission, Tekes (the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation), Nordic Council, UNESCO and a number of industrial partners, including Nokia, Elisa, TeliaSonera, Sanoma, YLE and MTV3. In 1998 the lab became an official department at the university. In January 2000 the Media Centre Lume ‚Äì the National Research and Development Center of audiovisual media ‚Äì was officially opened. Lume was located in the same premises as the Media Lab and offered its resources for study and research projects carried out in the Lab. The Lume was closed in 2016 as part of the new Aalto University's reorganisation. In 2001, the Ministry of Education Finland chose Media Lab as one of the national top educational units. In 2006 Media Lab was invited to the Ars Electronica. The Beta Lounge, Campus Exhibition presented over 20 works by Media Lab's MA, DA and alumni students and its four research groups of that time. Since then Media Lab researchers, designers and artist have collaborated in with the Ars Electronica Center in various projects. 2008 saw the beginnings of Aalto University, a new university. Aalto is the fusion of the University of Art and Design Helsinki where Media Lab is located, Helsinki School of Economics and Helsinki University of Technology. In 2010, as part of Aalto reorganisation, the Media Lab joined forces with Photography and Graphic Design, formerly of the Visual Culture department, to create the Department of Media. In 2015 the Media Lab moved to a temporary space at the Aalto Campus in Otaniemi. In autumn 2018 the Lab moved to a new V√§re-building designed and built for the School of Arts, Design and Architecture.  Teaching  Media Lab provides platform for Master of Arts and Doctor of Arts (equivalent to PhD) studies in three areas: New Media Design and Production, Sound in New Media and Game Design and Production. The doctoral students often work within the thematic research groups. Teaching is in English and about 40% of students are non-Finns.  Research  There are three research groups in the Media Lab: The Learning Environments research group (LeGroup) is involved in research, design and development of New Media tools, as well as their use and application, in the field of learning. Besides academic research papers the outcomes of the group are often software systems, software prototypes, applications and scenarios. The group's works are based on the social constructivist theory that sees learning as a participation in social processes of knowledge construction. The Learning Environments research group The Systems of Representation group conducts research into representation, culture, and knowledge in the digital dimension. The group works on research and design projects, educational activities, and publishes frequently on topics such as cultural heritage, design research, new media, synthetic reality and simulation. The Systems of Representation research group Sound and Physical Interaction (SOPI), a relatively new research group focusses on sound and its emerging role in designing new ways of interactions between humans through digital environments. The group's mission is to investigate and integrate innovative research activities in sound design and physical interaction practices on various levels to advance their roles and impact in the future of media and interactive art. In the thematic research groups, researchers and doctoral students often do art and design experiments related to interaction design, video game design, sonic interaction design, information visualization, digital visual art and sonic art.

These games were quite popular throughout Western Europe in the 18th century. Several different games were devised, some that did not require dice, but merely choosing a random number. The earliest example is Johann Philipp Kirnberger's ' (German for \\"The Ever-Ready Minuet and Polonaise Composer\\") (1757 [1st edition; revised 2nd 1783]).Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation, pp. 36 & 38n7. . Examples by well known composers include C. P. E. Bach's ' (German for \\"A method for making six bars of double counterpoint at the octave without knowing the rules\\") (1758) and Maximilian Stadler's ' (French for \\"A table for composing minuets and trios to infinity, by playing with two dice\\") (1780). In the early 20th century the Kaleidacousticon System, using arbitrarily combinable playing cards, was unsuccessfully marketed in the Boston area as a parlour game.Nierhaus (2009), p. 262. Aesthetics According to Lawrence Zbikowski, \\"In truth, chance played little part in the success of the music produced by such games. Instead, what was required of the compilers...[was] a little knowledge about how to put the game together and an understanding of the formal design of waltzes, etc.\\"Zbikowski, Lawrence M. (2002). Conceptualizing Music: Cognitive Structure, Theory, and Analysis, pp. 142‚Äì143. . Quoted in Berkowitz, Aaron (2010). The Improvising Mind: Cognition and Creativity in the Musical Moment, p. 65. . According to Stephen Hedges, \\"The 'galant' middle class in Europe was playing with mathematics. In this atmosphere of investigation and cataloguing, a systematic device that would seem to make it possible for anyone to write music was practically guaranteed popularity.Hedges, Stephen A. (1978). \\"Dice Music in the Eighteenth Century\\", pp. 184‚Äì185, Music and Letters 59: 180‚Äì87. Quoted in Berkowitz (2010), p. 65n60. According to Leonard Meyer, \\"Eighteenth-century composers constructed musical dice games while nineteenth century composers did not. ... [W]hat constrained the choice of figures [in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century music] were the claims of taste, coherent expression and propriety, given the genre of work being composed, rather than the inner necessity of a gradually unfolding, underlying process [as in nineteenth century music]\\".Meyer, Leonard (1989). Style and Music: Theory, History, and Ideology, p. 193. . See: musical development. The way these games work may be understood in analogy to sentence construction. 1 The cow ran past the field. 2 The pig walked through the yard. 3 The sheep ran into the marsh. One rolls one die for each word and selects the word from the appropriate column according to the number. Thus if one rolls 1 2 3 1 2 3 one is given, \\"The pig ran past the marsh.\\" Each progression is essentially the same, there may be more or less choices for different slots, and the choices offered for each slot are slight variations rather than being entirely different.  Mozart  The most well-known was published in 1792, by Mozart's publisher Nikolaus Simrock in Berlin (K. 294d or K. 516f). The game was attributed to Mozart, but this attribution has not been authenticated.Cope, David (1996). Experiments in Musical Intelligence, p. 7. Madison, Wisconsin: A‚ÄìR Editions, Inc. . The dice rolls randomly selected small sections of music, which would be patched together to create a musical piece. This game is capable of producing 1116 = 45,949,729,863,572,161 different yet similar waltzes.Zbikowski (2002), p. 148. Some measures have only one possibility no matter what the roll of the dice (measure 8/16) while other measures have a different possibility for each roll (measure 1/16).Berkowitz (2010), p. 66. Mozart's manuscript, written in 1787, consisting of 176 one-bar fragments of music, appears to be some kind of game or system for constructing music out of two-bar fragments, but contains no instructions and there is no evidence that dice were involved. The titles of the supposed Mozart compositions are: *' (German for \\"Instructions for the composition of as many waltzes as one desires with two dice, without understanding anything about music or composition\\") *' (German for \\"Instructions for the composition of polonaises...\\") Robert Xavier Rodr√≠guez composed his Musical Dice Game for string orchestra based on K. 516f.\\"Robert Xavier Rodr√≠guez: Musical Dice Game\\", Schirmer.com.

Career Alan Walker was involved in the formation of the World Council of Churches in 1948. He was superintendent of the Methodist (later Uniting Church in Australia) Wesley Mission, Pitt Street, Sydney, 1958‚Äì1978 and one of the founders of the National Christian Youth Convention (NCYC) in 1955 and Lifeline in 1963. He was first world director of evangelism for the World Methodist Council, 1978 to 1988. He was involved in founding the World Methodist Evangelism Institute (located at the United Methodist-related Candler School of Theology at Emory University) in Atlanta, 1982. He was principal of the Pacific College of Evangelism, now the Alan Walker College of Evangelism, in Sydney, 1989-1995. Following the closure of the Alan Walker College the Uniting Theological College in Sydney has been home to the Alan Walker Lectureship in Mission and Evangelism. Lifeline Sir Alan Walker launched Lifeline in Sydney, Australia in 1963 after a call from a distressed man who three days later took his own life. Walker launched a crisis line which initially operated out of the Methodist Central Mission in Sydney. Lifeline Sydney was two years in planning and preparation, with 150 people attending a nine-month training course to work at the Centre. A century old, dilapidated building owned by the Mission, on the fringes of downtown Sydney was renovated for the purposes of this new support centre. A staff of full- time employees was appointed to direct the work of these new telephone crisis support workers. The Director General of Post and Telephone Services authorised that this crisis support service should be listed on the Emergency Page of the Telephone Directory and the phones were installed. March 1963 saw the opening of the first official Lifeline Centre. The initiative was well received with over 100 calls for help being answered on the first day. In its 50th year, Lifeline had over 11,000 volunteers and spoke to more than 500,000 people in crisis annually.(Lifeline Australia Annual Report 2011/12) Honours and awards 1955: Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) It's an Honour: OBE * 1981: Knight Bachelor It's an Honour: Knight Bachelor * 1986: World Methodist Peace AwardWorld Methodist Council page of World Methodist Peace Award recipients * 1997: Named as one of 100 people as an Australian Living Treasure * 2001: Centenary Medal It's an Honour: Centenary Medal Personal life Walker was born in Sydney, New South Wales on 4 June 1911 to the RevD Alfred Edgar Walker (1877‚Äî1966) and Violet Louisa Walker (n√©e Lavis) (1881‚Äî1971).

This is not to be confused with Dolly the Sheep, the first animal to be successfully cloned from an adult somatic cell where there wasn‚Äôt modification carried out on the adult donor nucleus. Polly and Molly, like Dolly the Sheep, were cloned at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland. The creation of Polly and Molly built on the somatic nuclear transfer experiments that led to the cloning of Dolly the Sheep. The crucial difference was that in creating Polly and Molly, scientists used cells into which a new gene had been inserted. The gene chosen was a therapeutic protein to demonstrate the potential of such recombinant DNA technology combined with animal cloning. This could hopefully be used to produce pharmacological and therapeutic proteins to treat human diseases. The protein in question was the human blood clotting factor IX. Another difference from Dolly the Sheep was the source cell type of the nucleus that was transferred. Prior to the production of Polly and Molly, the only demonstrated way to make a transgenic animal was by microinjection of DNA into the pronuclei of fertilized oocytes (eggs). However, only a small proportion of the animals will integrate the injected DNA into their genome. In the rare cases that they do integrate this new genetic information, the pattern of expression of the injected transgene's protein due to the random integration is very variable. As the aim of such research is to produce an animal that expresses a particular protein in high levels in, for example, its milk, microinjection is a very costly procedure that does not usually produce the desired animal. In mice, there is an additional option for genetic transfer that is not available in other animals. Embryonic stem cells provide a means to transfer new DNA into the germline. They also allow precise genetic modifications by gene targeting. Modified embryonic stem cells can be selected in vitro before the experiment moves on further for the production of an animal. Embryonic stem cells capable of contributing to the germline of livestock species such as sheep have not been isolated. The production of Dolly the Sheep and also Megan and Morag, the two sheep that led to the production of Dolly, demonstrated that viable sheep can be produced by nuclear transfer from a variety of somatic cell types which have been cultured in vitro. Polly and Molly represented the further step in which somatic cells were cultured in vitro, just as in the case with the previous sheep. However, in this case they were transfected with foreign DNA, and the transfected cells which stably integrated this new piece of genetic information were selected. The nuclei of these somatic cells was then transferred into an empty oocyte, as in the procedure of nuclear transfer, and this was used to produce several transgenic animals. A cell type PDFF was used. PDFF5 would produce male animals and were not transduced. Cell type PDFF2 produced female animals and were transduced. Of the gestations that occurred, three PDFF2 animals were born, two of which survived birth, 7LL8 and 7LL12. These animals were transfected but contained a marker gene not the cloned gene of interest. These were named \\"Holly\\" and \\"Olly\\". Two more subsets of female-producing PDFF2 cells, PDFF2-12 and PDFF2-13, also produced animals which had the cell of interest together with the marker. Of these lambs, 7LL12, 7LL15, and 7LL13 were born alive and healthy. Two of these were named Polly and Molly. Transgene The transgene that was inserted in the donor somatic cells was designed to express the human clotting factor IX protein in the milk of sheep. This protein plays an essential role in blood coagulation, and deficiency leads to the disease haemophilia B of which treatment requires intravenous infusion of factor IX. The production of this protein in livestock milk, a process known as pharming, would provide a source of this therapeutic protein that would reduce the cost and also would be free of potential infectious risk associated with the current source of this protein (human blood).

Martillo was known for her charitable giving and strict devotion to Jesus Christ while becoming somewhat of a hermit dedicated to discerning his will. The death of her parents prompted her to relocate in order to work as a seamstress while doubling as a catechist and educator to some of her siblings who needed caring. But her devotion to God was strong and it led her to live amongst the Dominican religious in Peru where she spent time before her death. Her cause for sainthood commenced on 27 September 1975, under Pope Paul VI, and she became titled as a Servant of God; while the confirmation of her life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope John Paul II to name her as Venerable on 23 October 1987. Martillo was beatified on 25 October 1992, after the approval of a 1967 miracle, while the confirmation of a 1992 miracle allowed for Pope Benedict XVI to canonise her on 12 October 2008 in Saint Peter's Square. Life Narcisa de Jes√∫s Martillo Mor√°n was born on 29 October 1832 in the small village of San Jos√© in Nobol in Ecuador as the sixth of nine children born to Pedro Martillo and Josefina Mor√°n who were landowners. Her father was a great worker to the point that he amassed considerable wealth; he had a devotion to Blessed Mariana de Jes√∫s and Saint Jacinto of Poland. Her mother died in 1838 and she took up much of the domestic chores as a result of this while an elder sister and teacher taught her to read and write as well as to sing and use the guitar; she also learned how to sew and cook. The girl also turned a small room in her house into a domestic chapel. She received her Confirmation on 16 September 1839. Martillo frequented a small wood near her home for contemplation in solitude, while the guava tree near which she went to is now a large pilgrimage destination. The girl also chose the then-Blessed Mariana de Jes√∫s as her patron with whom she identified and strove to imitate in her own life. Martillo was known for being sweet and thoughtful with a peaceful and generous disposition; she was obedient to those around her and was well-known and loved in her village. Martillo was blonde with bright blue eyes and was strong and agile; she was also tall. The death of her father in January 1852 prompted her to relocate to Guayaquil where she lived with prominent nobles and it was here that she began her mission of helping the poor and the sick and caring for abandoned children. It was also here that she took a job as a seamstress in order to fund her mission as well as supporting her eight brothers and sisters. But she soon moved to Cuenca for some months where she went from home to home and lived with whoever would take her in including Mercedes de Jes√∫s Molina, to allow herself greater time for silent contemplation and penance. In 1865 her spiritual director fell ill, and died in 1868, which was at the time the local bishop invited her to live with the Carmelites even though she had refused the offer. In June 1868 she relocated to Lima in Peru at the advice of her new Franciscan spiritual director Pedro Gual where she lived in the Dominican convent at Patrocinio despite not being a nun. It was here that she followed a demanding schedule of eight hours of reflection which was offered in silence and solitude. In addition she devoted four hours of the night to various forms of mortification which included flagellation and the wearing of a crown of thorns. In terms of nourishment she fasted on bread and water alone and took the Eucharist as her sole form of sustenance while she was sometimes seen in an ecstatic state. In late September 1869 she developed high fevers for which medical remedies could do little and she died as a result before midnight on 8 December 1869; upon her death a nun reported a pleasant and sweet odor filling the room that Martillo had died in. She died upon the opening of the First Vatican Council. Her remains were deemed upon exhumation to be incorrupt in 1955, and were transferred from Peru back to her homeland of Ecuador until 1972, when moved to her village of Nobol. On 22 August 1998 a shrine in her honor was dedicated in Nobol where her remains now rest. Canonization Her remains in Ecuador. Upon her death the cities that she had dwelt in came to revere and acclaim her as a saint while the Dominican nuns she had lived with preserved her remains at their Peru convent. The cause for her canonization later commenced with the beginning of the informative process tasked with collecting documentation from 26 September 1961 until the process was closed on 10 July 1962 at which stage her writings received theological approval on 8 July 1965. The officials in charge of the cause sent a large Positio dossier to Rome to the Congregation for Rites for investigation before historians approved the cause on 8 May 1974. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Paul VI on 27 September 1975 and she became titled as a Servant of God as a result. Theologians met to discuss the cause on 24 July 1984 but did not come up with a clear consensus and so met again on 20 December 1984 where the group approved the cause. The members of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the cause as well on 16 June 1987. Martillo became titled as Venerable on 23 October 1987 after Pope John Paul II acknowledged the fact that she had lived a model life of heroic virtue. One miracle was required for her to be beatified and it had to be a healing that science and medicine could not explain. One such case arose and was investigated in a diocesan tribunal before the findings were submitted to the competent officials in Rome for further investigation. The C.C.S. validated this process on 30 June 1984 while a panel of medical experts approved the miraculous nature of this healing on 27 June 1991. Theologians approved it as well on 20 December 1991 after confirming the miracle came as a result of Martillo's intercession while the C.C.S. approved the findings of both bodies on 18 February 1992. John Paul II approved this miracle on 7 March 1992 and beatified her in Saint Peter's Square on 25 October 1992. The second and final miracle needed for full sainthood was investigated in the diocese of its origin before it received C.C.S. validation on 4 October 2002 upon all documents being submitted to them in Rome. The medical experts approved this miracle on 18 January 2006 as did the theologians on 4 April 2006 and the C.C.S. on 19 December 2006. Pope Benedict XVI approved this miracle on 1 June 2007 and formalized the date at a gathering of cardinals on 1 March 2008; Benedict XVI canonized Martillo on 12 October 2008. =Miracles= The miracle that led to her beatification was the healing of Juan Pes√°ntez Pe√±aranda who was single and working in banana plantations in Pasaje in El Oro. He was working when a banana stalk struck him in the head and caused several tumors to appear which repeated surgeries in 1967 could not cure. He was just over 20 at the time and didn't believe in miracles. He was at the Luis Vernanza Hospital when he met a policeman who suggested he write \\"Narcisita\\" on a piece of paper. He was skeptical that this would bring results but did this and had a dream of her that night which also caused him to be cured of his tumors. The miracle that led to her sainthood was the healing of Edelmina Arellano who was cured from a congenital defect in 1992. Edelmina was born without genital organs and at the age of seven was cured after her mother took her to the shrine dedicated to the then-Blessed and appealed for her intercession. It was mere hours later that the child had an appointment with her doctor who testified that the girl was normal like all other children with no defects apparent whatsoever.

It only has 3 sections, from the Hillcrest suburb of Durban to Ladysmith, from Warden to Villiers and from Heidelberg to Johannesburg. Route =Kwazulu- Natal= Its first section begins as a junction with the M13 Highway in Hillcrest, KwaZulu-Natal (in the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality; north- west of Durban; west of Kloof). The R103 begins as the Old Main Road and leaves Hillcrest in a roughly north-west direction and enters Cato Ridge from the east. In Cato Ridge, the road crosses the N3 at the 53 exit and then follows the south side of the N3, leaving the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, before recrossing the N3 freeway at Camperdown. It follows the N3 towards the outskirts of Pietermaritzburg, crisscrossing the freeway several times. It enters the suburb of Scottsville in Pietermaritzburg from the south-east where at a T-junction it co-signs with the R56 and heads north through the suburb. The R56 breaks of to the east and the R103 leaves Scottsville crossing the Msunduzi River and heading north-west into the Pietermaritzburg CBD as its main road. Leaving the CBD, it continues into the suburb of Athlone. The road resumes following the N3 in a north-westerly direction passing through Hilton before reaching the outskirts of Howick. Crossing under the N3, it enters the suburbs of Howick and circles the town as an easterly ring road before reaching the N3 Junction 103 in the north close to the Midmar Dam. Leaving the N3, it heads in a north-westerly direction passing through Lions River, Ligetton West and Zenzani before turning north outside the town of Nottingham Road and heading towards the town of Mooi River. Leaving Mooi River, the road heads north-east then, after a short distance, heads north-west, eventually crossing the Boesmans River and entering Estcourt from the east. It heads north through Estcourt as its main road before leaving the town towards the north-west. It then passes through Frere, crossing the Bloukrans River, before intersecting the R74 at a t-junction. Co-signed with R74, it heads north-east and enters Colenso from the south, where its splits from the R74 which heads east.

The island is the northernmost point of Iceland and lies north of the Arctic Circle. It is named after Kolbeinn Sigmundsson from Kolbeinsdalur in Skagafj√∂r√∞ur who is said to have broken his ship there and died with his men, according to Svarfd√¶la saga. A basalt landform, devoid of vegetation, it is subject to rapid wave erosion and is expected to disappear in the near future. Erosion rate data from 1994 suggested that this would happen around 2020. As of August 2020, two small sections of the island remain visible during low tide.  History  The original size of the island is unknown. When it was first measured in 1616, its size was from north to south and east to west. By 1903, it had already diminished to half that size. In August 1985, the size was given as across. At the beginning of 2001, Kolbeinsey had reduced to an area of a mere , which would correspond to the size of a circle of about in diameter. The island has a maximum elevation of . A helicopter landing site was constructed on the island in 1989 but efforts to strengthen the island have subsided in part because of agreements with Denmark over limits. In March 2006, it was stated that helicopters were no longer able to land on Kolbeinsey. It had been found that almost a half of the helipad which was laid with concrete in 1989 had been destroyed when a large piece of rock separated from the rest of the island. In August 2020, YouTuber Tom Scott uploaded a video which confirmed the continued‚Äîalbeit further eroded‚Äîexistence of the island at low tide.  Geology  A submarine eruption was reported in 1999 near the Kolbeinsey Ridge northwest of Gr√≠msey. Kolbeinsey is the only subaerial expression of this portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It formed during the late-Pleistocene or Holocene. Dredged glass shards indicate submarine eruptive activity during the late-Pleistocene until at least 11,800 radiocarbon years ago.

Sanders, 372 U.S. 368 (1963), was a Supreme Court of the United States case dealing with equal representation in regard to the American election system and formulated the famous \\"one person, one vote\\" standard for legislative districting. Background James Sanders, a voter in Fulton County, Georgia, brought a lawsuit which challenged the legality of the County Unit System. James H. Gray, the chairman of the State Executive Committee of the Democratic Party, was one of the named defendants as the suit focused on the Democratic party primary elections which usually determined the selection of Georgia officeholders. Sanders argued that the County Unit System gave unequal and preferential voting power to smaller counties. Rural counties which accounted for one-third of Georgia's population, accounted for a majority of County Unit votes. Fulton County had 14.11% of Georgia's population at that time, but only 1.46% (6 unit votes) of the 410 Unit Votes. Echols County, Georgia, the smallest county in Georgia at the time, had 1,876United States Census, 1960 people or .05% of the state's population and .48% (1 unit vote) of the unit system. The system gave votes to Fulton County at a proportion of one-tenth the county population while giving Echols County a vote which was 10 times the population of the county. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in this case despite having refused to hear previous challenges to the Unit System. The court's decision By a vote of 8 to 1, the court struck down the County Unit System. Justice William O. Douglas wrote the majority opinion and said \\"The concept of political equality...can mean only one thingone person, one vote\\". The court found that the separation of voters in the same election into different classes was a violation of the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection. Justice John Marshall Harlan II dissented, suggesting the case be sent back for retrial, which would have investigated the constitutional requirements for legislative districts. Aftermath Georgia had the option of modifying the County Unit System to make it more equal, but instead the state decided to move to using the popular vote in primary elections.

It is historically rooted in the conflict known as La Violencia, which was triggered by the 1948 assassination of populist political leader Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n, and in the aftermath of the anti-communist repression (backed by the United States and others)https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/discussions/176886/h-diplo- article-review-692-%E2%80%9Creading-cuban-revolution-bogot%C3%A1-1957 in rural Colombia in the 1960s that led Liberal and Communist militants to re-organize into FARC. The reasons for fighting vary from group to group. The FARC and other guerrilla movements claim to be fighting for the rights of the poor in Colombia to protect them from government violence and to provide social justice through communism. The Colombian government claims to be fighting for order and stability, and to protect the rights and interests of its citizens. The paramilitary groups claim to be reacting to perceived threats by guerrilla movements. According to a study by Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory, 220,000 people have died in the conflict between 1958 and 2013, most of them civilians (177,307 civilians and 40,787 fighters) and more than five million civilians were forced from their homes between 1985 ‚Äì 2012, generating the world's second largest population of internally displaced persons (IDPs). 16.9% of the population in Colombia has been a direct victim of the war. 2.3 million children have been displaced from their homes, and 45,000 children killed, according to national figures cited by Unicef. In total, one in three of the 7.6 million registered victims of the conflict are children, and since 1985, 8,000 minors have disappeared. A Special Unit was created to search for persons deemed as missing within the context of and due to the armed conflict. On 23 June 2016, the Colombian government and the FARC rebels signed a historic ceasefire deal, bringing them closer to ending more than five decades of conflict. Although the deal was rejected in the subsequent October plebiscite, the same month, President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring the country's more than 50-year-long civil war to an end. A revised peace deal was signed the following month and submitted to Congress for approval. The House of Representatives unanimously approved the plan on November 30, a day after the Senate also gave its backing. Armed conflict The armed conflict in Colombia emerged due to a combination of economic, political and social factors in the country. Various organizations and scholars that have studied the conflict trace it back to a long history of political violence, a high social and economic inequality, the lack of strong state capable of providing for its citizens (especially in the rural and remote areas of the country), conflict of political ideologies (mainly capitalist-right wing groups represented by the government against communist left wings groups represented by the armed groups), and an unequal distribution of land, power, and wealth in the country. The precise date of the conflict's beginning is still disputed, with some scholars claiming it started in 1958 with the start of the Frente Nacional (\\"National Front\\") and the end of La Violencia (\\"The Violence\\") meanwhile others believe it was in 1964 with the creation of the FARC and the end of the National Front. Some scholars even trace it back to the 1920s, with the unequal distribution of land in the country which has been one of the main causes and disputes of the conflict throughout the years. In the early period (1970s), guerrilla groups like the FARC, the ELN and others adopted a slogan of greater equality through communism, which came to be supported by many people, mostly in low-income and rural areas of the country. During these years the violence was low in intensity and occurred mainly in remote parts of the country. However, the balance of power and influence shifted in the mid-1980s when Colombia granted greater political and fiscal autonomy to local governments, strengthening the position of the Colombian Government in more remote regions of the country. In 1985, during peace talks between President Belisario Betancur and the FARC, the armed group co-created the left-wing Patriotic Union (UP) political party as a path to leave violence behind and eventually move into politics. However, between 1985 and 2002 right-wing paramilitaries, with the help and support from parts of the government, murdered and disappeared 4,153 members and supporters of the party, including two presidential candidates, six of 16 congressmen, 17 regional representatives and 163 councilmen. This systematic killing decimated the organization and aggravated the broader conflict. In the 1980s the level of violence increased in many parts of the country as a result of the beginning of the drug trafficking. Trafficking had begun in the 1960s and 70s, when a group of Americans began to smuggle marijuana. Later, the American Mafia began to establish drug trafficking in Colombia in cooperation with local marijuana producers. Cocaine (and other drugs) manufactured in Colombia were historically mostly consumed in the US as well as Europe. Organized crime in Colombia grew increasingly powerful in the 1970s and 80s with the introduction of massive drug trafficking to the United States from Colombia. After the Colombian Government dismantled many of the drug cartels that appeared in the country during the 1980s, left-wing guerrilla groups and rightwing paramilitary organizations resumed some of their drug-trafficking activities and resorted to extortion and kidnapping for financing, activities which led to a loss of support from the local population. These funds helped finance paramilitaries and guerrillas, allowing these organizations to buy weapons which were then sometimes used to attack military and civilian targets. During the presidency of √Ålvaro Uribe, the government applied more military pressure on the FARC and other outlawed far-left groups. After the offensive, many security indicators improved. As part of a controversial peace process, the AUC (right-wing paramilitaries) as a formal organization had ceased to function. Colombia achieved a great decrease in cocaine production, leading White House drug czar R. Gil Kerlikowske to announce that Colombia was no longer the world's biggest producer of cocaine. The United States is still the world's largest consumer of cocaine and other illegal drugs. In February 2008, millions of Colombians demonstrated against the FARC and other outlawed groups. 26,648 FARC and ELN combatants have decided to demobilize since 2002. During these years the military forces of the Republic of Colombia were strengthened. The Peace process in Colombia, 2012 refers to the dialogue in Havana, Cuba between the Colombian government and guerrilla of FARC-EP with the aim to find a political solution to the armed conflict. After almost four years of peace negotiations, the Colombian state and the FARC announced consensus on a 6-point plan towards peace and reconciliation. The government also began a process of assistance and reparation for victims of conflict. Recently, U.P. supporters reconstituted the political party, within the process of reconciliation. Colombia's congress approved the revised peace accord. In February 2015, the Historical Commission on the Conflict and its Victims (Comisi√≥n Hist√≥rica del Conflicto Armado y sus V√≠ctimas ‚Äì CHCV) published its report entitled \\"Contribution to an Understanding of the Armed Conflict in Colombia\\". The document addresses the \\"multiple reasons for the conflict, the principle factors and circumstances that made it possible and the most notable impacts on the population\\", and explains Colombia's armed conflict in terms of international law. Background The origin of the armed conflict in Colombia goes back to 1920 with agrarian disputes over the Sumapaz and Tequendama regions. Much of the background of Colombian conflict is rooted in La Violencia, a conflict in which liberal and leftist parties united against the dictator of Colombia, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. Colombia at the time was a banana republic, being dominated by foreign monopolies specifically the United Fruit Company. The United Fruit Company existed to buy large amounts of agricultural products in Latin America at cheap prices, then resell the crops in foreign markets for inflated amounts. Local farmers were largely impoverished and were forced to grow specific crops creating a monoculture in which farmers depended on the company for all food, products and wages. The United Fruit Company would usually pay their workers in coupons, which was worthless outside company stores, the stores would charge extravagant prices compared to what workers earned. As well as this the system of employment was usually in which farmers would be forced to sell their property to the United Fruit Company and then be indebted to the company having to work on the land and pay back the company. The United Fruit Company would hire private militaries to enforce its power, their purpose was to put down worker calls for reform, destroy unions, and put down worker revolutions. Any potential threat to the United Fruit Company would be overturned in a company backed coups, which would prop up friendly puppet politicians and support right wing militias to maintain power. Workers would often organize and strike against these conditions, and would form local militias against the United Fruit Company. This would often lead to conflict between the United Fruit Company and the workers. This culminated in 1928 in which farmers in Ci√©naga went on strike for working conditions and called for: End to temporary contracts, the creation of mandatory worker insurance, the creation of compensation for work accidents, the creation of hygienic dormitories, the 6 day work weeks, the implementation of a minimum wage, the abolishment of wages through company coupons and office stores, and the recognition of farmers and tenets as employees with legal rights. The strike quickly grew becoming the largest strike in all of Colombia's history, with many Socialists, Anarchists, Marxists and Leftists joining and organizing the strike. The United Fruit Company demanded that the workers disband and the Union should disband. The US government stated that if the Colombian government did not protect the interests of the United Fruit Company that the US would invade Colombia with the US Marines. The Colombian government sent the Colombian Army into Ci√©naga for the interests of the United Fruit Company. After a standoff with the strikers, the Colombian Army shot into the crowd of strikers leading to 100-2,000 people to be massacred in what became known as the Banana Massacre. After this the Colombian Public was outraged, and it led to an explosion of Leftists and Revolutionary organizations, in Bogota leftists students protested and organized against the government of Colombia, organized to overthrow the Colombian Government. This opposition to Colombian Government exploded in 1948, upon hearing of the assassination of socialist candidate Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n, many poor workers saw the death of Gait√°n as political assassination orchestrated by the rich. Workers began rioting and destroying the Colombian capital Bogota, leading to the death of 4,000 people. When news of the death of Gait√°n reached the countryside the local militias were furious and immediately started a civil war known as La Violencia. Joined by fellow Leftists a brutal war was fought for over 10 years leading to the death of 200,000 people and the destruction of much of the country, resulting in a peace settlement and the changing of power to the Colombian Conservative Party to the Colombian Liberal Party and the Colombian Communist Party in 1958. As La Violencia wound down, most self-defense and guerrilla units made up of Liberal Party supporters demobilized, but at the same time some former Liberals and active Communist groups continued operating in several rural enclaves. One of the Liberal bands was a group known as the \\"Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia\\" (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), or FARC, formed by Pedro Antonio Marin in 1964, FARC was founded out of fighters of unhappy with the peace settlement. The goal of the FARC, among other things, was redistribution of land that would benefit poor peasant farmers like Marin, along with the desire to establish a communist state. In 1958, an exclusively bipartisan political alternation system, known as the National Front, resulted from an agreement between the Liberal and Conservative parties. The agreement had come as a result of the two parties attempting to find a final political solution to the decade of mutual violence and unrest, remaining in effect until 1974. Timeline =1960s= In the early 1960s Colombian Army units loyal to the National Front began to attack peasant communities. This happened throughout Colombia with the Colombian army considering that these peasant communities were enclaves for bandits and Communists. It was the 1964 attack on the community of Marquetalia that motivated the later creation of FARC. Despite the infantry and police encirclement of the villages inside Marquetalia (3500 men swept through the area), Manuel Marulanda managed to escape the army cordon. Unlike the rural FARC, which had roots in the previous Liberal peasant struggles, the ELN was mostly an outgrowth of university unrest and would subsequently tend to follow a small group of charismatic leaders, including Camilo Torres Restrepo. Both guerrilla groups remained mostly operational in remote areas of the country during the rest of the 1960s. The Colombian government organized several short-lived counter-guerrilla campaigns in the late 1950s and early 1960s. These efforts were aided by the U.S. government and the CIA, which employed hunter-killer teams and involved U.S. personnel from the previous Philippine campaign against the Huks, and which would later participate in the subsequent Phoenix Program in the Vietnam War. =1970s= By 1974, another challenge to the state's authority and legitimacy had come from the 19th of April Movement (M-19), leading to a new phase in the conflict. The M-19 was a mostly urban guerrilla group, founded in response to an alleged electoral fraud during the final National Front election of Misael Pastrana Borrero (1970‚Äì1974) and the forced removal of former president Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. =1980s= By 1982, the perceived passivity of the FARC, together with the relative success of the government's efforts against the M-19 and the ELN, enabled the administration of the Liberal Party's Julio C√©sar Turbay Ayala (1978‚Äì82) to lift a state-of- siege decree that had been in effect, on and off, for most of the previous 30 years. Under the latest such decree, president Turbay had implemented security policies that, though of some military value against the M-19 in particular, were considered highly questionable both inside and outside Colombian circles due to numerous accusations of military human rights abuses against suspects and captured guerrillas. Citizen exhaustion due to the conflict's newfound intensity led to the election with 47% of the popular vote of president Belisario Betancur (1982‚Äì1986), a Conservative. Betancur directed peace feelers at all the insurgents, and negotiated a 1984 cease-fire with the FARC at La Uribe, Meta, after a 1982 release of many guerrillas imprisoned during the previous effort to overpower them. A truce was also arranged with the M-19. The ELN, however, rejected any negotiations and continued to rebuild through the use of extortion and threats, in particular against oil companies of European and U.S. origin. At the same time as these developments, the growing illegal drug trade was becoming increasingly important to all participants in the Colombian conflict. Guerrillas and newly wealthy drug lords had mutually uneven relations and numerous incidents occurred between them. Eventually the kidnapping of drug cartel family members by guerrillas led to the creation in 1981 of the Muerte a Secuestradores (\\"Death to Kidnappers\\") death squad (MAS). The Medell√≠n Cartel and other cartels came under pressure from the U.S. government and from critical sectors of Colombian society who supported the extradition of suspected Colombian cartel members to the U.S.. The cartels responded by bribing or murdering numerous public officials, politicians and others. Their victims included Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, whose assassination in 1984 led the Betancur administration to confront the drug lords directly. The first negotiated cease-fire with the M-19 ended when the guerrillas resumed fighting in 1985. The M-19 claimed that the cease-fire had not been fully respected by official security forces, alleged that several of its members had suffered threats and assaults, and questioned the government's real willingness to implement any accords. The Betancur administration in turn criticized the M-19's actions and questioned its commitment to the peace process, while at the same time continuing to advance high-profile negotiations with the FARC. These negotiations led to the creation of the Patriotic Union (Uni√≥n Patri√≥tica) -UP-, a legal and non-clandestine political organization. On November 6, 1985, the M-19 stormed the Colombian Palace of Justice and held the Supreme Court magistrates hostage, intending to put president Betancur on trial. The military responded with force and in the ensuing crossfire some 120 people lost their lives, including most of the guerrillas (several high-ranking operatives among them) and 12 Supreme Court Judges. Both sides blamed each other for the bloodbath, which marked the end of Betancur's peace process. Meanwhile, individual FARC members initially joined the UP leadership in representation of the guerrilla command, though most of the guerrilla's chiefs and militiamen did not demobilize nor disarm, as that was not a requirement of the process at that point in time. Tension soon significantly increased, as both sides began to accuse each other of not respecting the cease-fire. According to historian Daniel Pec√°ut, the creation of the Patriotic Union took the guerrillas' political message to a wider public outside of the traditional communist spheres of influence and led to local electoral victories in regions such as Urab√° and Antioquia, with their mayoral candidates winning 23 municipalities and their congressional ones gaining 14 seats (five in the Senate, nine in the lower Chamber) in 1988. According to journalist Steven Dudley, who interviewed ex-FARC as well as former members of the UP and the Communist Party, FARC leader Jacobo Arenas insisted to his subordinates that the UP's creation did not mean that the group would lay down its arms; neither did it imply a rejection of the Seventh Conference's military strategy.Dudley, p. 56 Pec√°ut states that new recruits entered the guerrilla army and its urban militia units during this period, and that the FARC continued to carry out kidnappings and to target regional politicians for assassination.Pec√°ut, p. 51-52 In October 1987 Jaime Pardo Leal, who had been the UP's presidential candidate the previous year, was assassinated amid a wave of violence in which thousands of the party's members perished at the hands of death squads.Dudley, pp. 91‚Äì104 According to Pec√°ut, the killers included members of the military and the political class who had opposed Betancur's peace process and considered the UP to be little more than a \\"facade\\" for the FARC, as well as drug traffickers and landowners who were also involved in the establishment of paramilitary groups.P√©caut, p.51 =1990s= Early 1990s The Virgilio Barco Vargas (1986‚Äì1990) administration, in addition to continuing to handle the difficulties of the complex negotiations with the guerrillas, also inherited a particularly chaotic confrontation against the drug lords, who were engaged in a campaign of terrorism and murder in response to government moves in favor of their extradition overseas. In June 1987, the ceasefire between FARC and the Colombian government formally collapsed after the guerrillas attacked a military unit in the jungles of Caquet√°.Pec√°ut, p. 52Dudley, p. 102 According to journalist Steven Dudley, FARC founder Jacobo Arenas considered the incident to be a \\"natural\\" part of the truce and reiterated the group's intention to continue the dialogue, but President Barco sent an ultimatum to the guerrillas and demanded that they immediately disarm or face military retaliation. Regional guerrilla and Army skirmishes created a situation where each violation of the ceasefire rendered it null in each location, until it was rendered practically nonexistent. By 1990, at least 2,500 members of the FARC-founded Patriotic Union had been murdered, according to historian Daniel Pec√°ut, leading up to that year's assassination of presidential candidate Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa. The Colombian government initially blamed drug lord Pablo Escobar for the murder but journalist Steven Dudley argues that many in the UP pointed at then-Interior Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds for publicly calling out the UP as the \\"political wing of FARC\\" shortly before the murder, while others claimed it was the result of an alliance between Fidel Casta√±o, members of the Colombian military and the DAS.Dudley, pp. 162‚Äì165 Pec√°ut and Dudley argue that significant tensions had emerged between Jaramillo, FARC and the Communist Party due to the candidate's recent criticism of the armed struggle and their debates over the rebels' use of kidnapping, almost leading to a formal break.Dudley, pp. 127‚Äì139, 165‚Äì166Pec√°ut, pp. 51‚Äì52 Jaramillo's death led to a large exodus of UP militants; in addition, by then many FARC cadres who joined the party had already returned to clandestinity, using the UP experience as an argument in favor of revolutionary war.Dudley, pp. 165‚Äì166 The M-19 and several smaller guerrilla groups were successfully incorporated into a peace process as the 1980s ended and the '90s began, which culminated in the elections for a Constituent Assembly of Colombia that would write a new constitution, which took effect in 1991. Contacts with the FARC, which had irregularly continued despite the end of the ceasefire and the official 1987 break from negotiations, were temporarily cut off in 1990 under the presidency of C√©sar Gaviria Trujillo (1990‚Äì1994). The Colombian Army's assault on the FARC's Casa Verde sanctuary at La Uribe, Meta, followed by a FARC offensive that sought to undermine the deliberations of the Constitutional Assembly, began to highlight a significant break in the uneven negotiations carried over from the previous decade. Both parties nevertheless never completely broke off some amount of political contacts for long, as some peace feelers continued to exist, leading to short rounds of conversations in both Caracas, Venezuela (1991) and Tlaxcala, Mexico (1992). Despite the signing of several documents, no concrete results were achieved when the talks ended. Mid-1990s FARC military activity increased throughout the bulk of the 1990s as the group continued to grow in wealth from both kidnapping and drug-related activities, while drug crops rapidly spread throughout the countryside. The guerrillas protected many of the coca growers from eradication campaigns and allowed them to grow and commercialize coca in exchange for a \\"tax\\" either in money or in crops. In this context, FARC had managed to recruit and train more fighters, beginning to use them in concentrated attacks in a novel and mostly unexpected way. This led to a series of high-profile raids and attacks against Colombian state bases and patrols, mostly in the southeast of Colombia but also affecting other areas. In mid-1996, a civic protest movement made up of an estimated 200,000 coca growers from Putumayo and part of Cauca began marching against the Colombian government to reject its drug war policies, including fumigations and the declaration of special security zones in some departments. Different analysts have stressed that the movement itself fundamentally originated on its own, but at the same time, FARC heavily encouraged the marchers and actively promoted their demands both peacefully and through the threat of force. Additionally, in 1997 and 1998, town councilmen in dozens of municipalities of the south of the country were threatened, killed, kidnapped, forced to resign or to exile themselves to department capitals by the FARC and the ELN. In Las Delicias, Caquet√°, five FARC fronts (about 400 guerrillas) recognized intelligence pitfalls in a Colombian Army base and exploited them to overrun it on August 30, 1996, killing 34 soldiers, wounding 17 and taking some 60 as prisoners. Another significant attack took place in El Billar, Caquet√° on March 2, 1998, where a Colombian Army counterinsurgency battalion was patrolling, resulting in the death of 62 soldiers and the capture of some 43. Other FARC attacks against Police bases in Miraflores, Guaviare and La Uribe, Meta in August 1998 killed more than a hundred soldiers, policemen and civilians, and resulted in the capture or kidnapping of a hundred more. These attacks, and the dozens of members of the Colombian security forces taken prisoner by the FARC, contributed to increasingly shaming the government of president Ernesto Samper Pizano (1994‚Äì1998) in the eyes of sectors of public and political opinion. He was already the target of numerous critics due to revelations of a drug-money scandal surrounding his presidential campaign. Perceptions of corruption due to similar scandals led to Colombia's decertification as a country cooperating with the United States in the war on drugs in 1995 (when the effects of the measure were temporarily waived), 1996 and 1997. The Samper administration reacted against FARC's attacks by gradually abandoning numerous vulnerable and isolated outposts in more than 100,000 km2 of the rural countryside, instead concentrating Army and Police forces in the more heavily defended strongholds available, which allowed the guerrillas to more directly mobilize through and influence events in large areas of rural territory which were left with little or no remaining local garrisons. Samper also contacted the guerrillas in order to negotiate the release of some or all of the hostages in FARC hands, which led to the temporary demilitarization of the municipality of Cartagena del Chair√°, Caquet√° in July 1997 and the unilateral liberation of 70 soldiers, a move which was opposed by the command of the Colombian military. Other contacts between the guerrillas and government, as well as with representatives of religious and economic sectors, continued throughout 1997 and 1998. Altogether, these events were interpreted by some Colombian and foreign analysts as a turning point in the armed confrontation, giving the FARC the upper hand in the military and political balance, making the Colombian government a target of critics from some observers who concluded that its weakness was being evidenced, perhaps even overshadowing a future guerrilla victory in the middle term. A leaked 1998 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report went so far as to speculate that this could be possible within 5 years if the guerrilla's rate of operations was kept up without effective opposition. Some viewed this report as inaccurate and alarmist, claiming that it did not properly take into account many factors, such as possible actions that the Colombian state and the U.S. might take in response to the situation, nor the effects of the existence of paramilitary groups. Also during this period, paramilitary activities increased, both legally and illegally. The creation of legal CONVIVIR self-defense and intelligence gathering groups was authorized by Congress and the Samper administration in 1994. Members of CONVIVIR groups were accused of committing numerous abuses against the civilian population by several human rights organizations. The groups were left without legal support after a 1997 decision by the Colombian Constitutional Court which restricted many of their prerogatives and demanded stricter oversight. However, in April 1997, preexisting paramilitary forces and several former CONVIVIR members were joined to create the AUC, a large paramilitary militia closely tied to drug trafficking which carried out attacks on the FARC and ELN rebel groups as well as civilians starting with the 1997 Mapirip√°n Massacre. The AUC, originally present around the central/northwest part of the country, executed a series of raids into areas of guerrilla influence, targeting those that they considered as either guerrillas or their supporters. This resulted in a continuing series of massacres. After some of these operations, government prosecutors and/or human rights organizations blamed officers and members of Colombian Army and police units for either passively permitting these acts, or directly collaborating in their execution. =1998‚Äì1999= On August 7, 1998, Andr√©s Pastrana Arango was sworn in as the President of Colombia. A member of the Conservative Party, Pastrana defeated Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa in a run-off election marked by high voter turn-out and little political unrest. The new president's program was based on a commitment to bring about a peaceful resolution of Colombia's longstanding civil conflict and to cooperate fully with the United States to combat the trafficking of illegal drugs. In July 1999, Colombian military forces attacked the town of Puerto Lleras, Colombia where FARC rebels were stationed. Using U.S. supplied aircraft and equipment, and backed with U.S. logistical support, Colombian government forces strafed and bombed the town for over 72 hours. In the attack, three civilians were killed, and several others were wounded as the military attacked hospitals, churches, ambulances, and residential areas. FARC rebels were forced to flee the area, and many were killed or wounded. The Colombian government claimed that this was a significant victory, while human rights groups claimed this as proof that \\"anti-narcotics\\" aid, was actually just military aid which was being used to fight a leftist insurgency.Tod Robberson, \\"U.S. aid questioned in Colombian battle\\" , Dallas Morning News, 08/16/1999 (accessed: 02/27/2010) =2000‚Äì2006= The years from 2000‚Äì2006 were bloody ones in Colombia with thousands of deaths every year resulting from the ongoing war between the Colombian Armed Forces, Paramilitary groups such as the AUC and the rebel groups (mainly the FARC, ELN and also the EPL). The fighting resulted in massive internal displacement of Colombia's civilian population and thousands of civilian deaths. During President Uribe's first term in office (2002‚Äì2006), the security situation inside Colombia showed some measure of improvement and the economy, while still fragile, also showed some positive signs of recovery according to observers. But relatively little has been accomplished in structurally solving most of the country's other grave problems, such as poverty and inequality, possibly in part due to legislative and political conflicts between the administration and the Colombian Congress (including those over a controversial project to eventually give Uribe the possibility of re-election), and a relative lack of freely allocated funds and credits. Some critical observers considered that Uribe's policies, while reducing crime and guerrilla activity, were too slanted in favor of a military solution to Colombia's internal war while neglecting grave social and human rights concerns. Critics have asked for Uribe's government to change this position and make serious efforts towards improving the human rights situation inside the country, protecting civilians and reducing any abuses committed by the armed forces. Political dissenters and labor union members, among others, have suffered from threats and have been murdered. In 2001 the largest government supported paramilitary group, the AUC, which had been linked to drug trafficking and attacks on civilians, was added to the US State Department's list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations and the European Union and Canada soon followed suit. On January 17, 2002, right-wing paramilitaries entered the village of Chengue, and divided up the villagers into two groups. They then went from person to person in one of the groups, smashing each person's head with sledgehammers and rocks, killing 24 people, as the Colombian military sat by and watched. Two other bodies were later discovered dumped in a shallow grave. As the paramilitaries left, they set fire to the village. In 2004, it was revealed by the National Security Archive that a 1991 document from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency had described then-Senator Uribe as a \\"close personal friend\\" and collaborator of Pablo Escobar. The Uribe administration denied several of the allegations in the 1991 report. Starting in 2004 a disarmament process was begun of Colombia's paramilitary groups (especially the AUC) and was completed on April 12, 2006, when 1,700 fighters turned in their weapons in the town of Casibare. In May 2006, the Colombian presidential election resulted in Uribe winning re-election with a historic first round vote tally of 62%, followed by leftist Carlos Gaviria with 22% and Horacio Serpa. =2007‚Äì2009= On June 28, 2007 the FARC suddenly reported the death of 11 of the 12 kidnapped provincial deputies from Valle del Cauca Department. The Colombian government accused the FARC of executing the hostages and stated that government forces had not made any rescue attempts. FARC claimed that the deaths occurred during a crossfire, after an attack to one of its camps by an \\"unidentified military group\\". FARC did not report any other casualties on either side. In 2007, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez and Colombian Senator Piedad C√≥rdoba were acting as authorised mediators in the ongoing Humanitarian Exchange between the FARC and the government of Colombia. Colombian President √Ålvaro Uribe had given Ch√°vez permission to mediate, under the conditions that all meetings with the FARC would take place in Venezuela and that Ch√°vez would not contact members of the Colombian military directly, but instead go through proper diplomatic channels. However, President Uribe abruptly terminated Ch√°vez's mediation efforts on November 22, 2007, after Ch√°vez personally contacted General Mario Montoya Uribe, the Commander of the Colombian National Army. In response, Ch√°vez said that he was still willing to mediate, but had withdrawn Venezuela's ambassador to Colombia and placed Colombian-Venezuelan relations \\"in a freezer\\" President Uribe responded by accusing Ch√°vez of legitimizing terrorism and pursuing an expansionist project on the continent. Several scandals have affected Uribe's administration. The Colombian parapolitics scandal expanded during his second term, involving numerous members of the administration's ruling coalition. Many pro-government lawmakers, such as the President's cousin Mario Uribe, have been investigated for their possible ties to paramilitary organizations. At the end of 2007, FARC agreed to release former senator Consuelo Gonz√°lez, politician Clara Rojas and her son Emmanuel, born in captivity after a relationship with one of her captors. Operation Emmanuel was proposed and set up by Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez, with the permission of the Colombian government. The mission was approved on December 26. Although, on December 31, FARC claimed that the hostage release had been delayed because of Colombian military operations. On the same time, Colombian President √Ålvaro Uribe indicated that FARC had not freed the three hostages because Emmanuel may not be in their hands anymore. Two FARC gunmen were taken prisoner. Colombian authorities added that a boy matching Emmanuel's description had been taken to a hospital in San Jos√© del Guaviare in June 2005. The child was in poor condition; one of his arms was hurt, he had severe malnutrition, and he had diseases that are commonly suffered in the jungle. Having been evidently mistreated, the boy was later sent to a foster home in Bogot√° and DNA tests were announced in order to confirm his identity. On January 4, 2008, the results of a mitochondrial DNA test, comparing the child's DNA with that of his potential grandmother Clara de Rojas, were revealed by the Colombian government. It was reported that there was a very high probability that the boy was indeed part of the Rojas family. The same day, FARC released a communique in which they admitted that Emmanuel had been taken to Bogot√° and \\"left in the care of honest persons\\" for safety reasons until a humanitarian exchange took place. The group accused President Uribe of \\"kidnapping\\" the child in order to sabotage his liberation. However, on January 10, 2008, FARC released Rojas and Gonzalez through a humanitarian commission headed by the International Committee of the Red Cross. On January 13, 2008, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez stated his disapproval with the FARC strategy of armed struggle and kidnapping saying \\"I don't agree with kidnapping and I don't agree with armed struggle\\". He repeated his call for a political solution and an end to the war on March and June 2008, \\"The guerrilla war is history...At this moment in Latin America, an armed guerrilla movement is out of place\\". In February 2008, FARC released four others political hostages \\"as a gesture of goodwill\\" toward Ch√°vez, who had brokered the deal and sent Venezuelan helicopters with Red Cross logos into the Colombian jungle to pick up the freed hostages. On March 1, 2008, the Colombian armed forces launched a military operation 1.8 kilometres into Ecuador on a FARC position, killing 24, including Ra√∫l Reyes, member of the FARC Central High Command. This led to the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis between Colombia and Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, supported by Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez. On March 3, Iv√°n R√≠os, also a member of the FARC Central High Command was killed by his security chief \\"Rojas\\". In March 2008 alone, FARC lost 3 members of their Secretariat, including their founder. On May 24, 2008, Colombian magazine, Revista Semana, published an interview with Colombian defense minister Juan Manuel Santos in which Santos mentions the death of Manuel Marulanda V√©lez. The news was confirmed by FARC-commander 'Timochenko' on Venezuelan based television station Telesur on May 25, 2008. 'Timochenko' announced the new commander in chief is 'Alfonso Cano'. In May 2008, a dozen jailed paramilitary leaders were extradited to the United States on drug-related charges. In 2009, extradited paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso would claim that the AUC had supported Uribe's 2002 election, but said that this was a result of their similar \\"ideological discourse\\" and not the result of any direct prior arrangement. On July 2, 2008, the Colombian armed forces launched Operation Jaque that resulted in the freedom of 15 political hostages, including former Colombian presidential candidate √çngrid Betancourt, Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and Keith Stansell, three American military contractors employed by Northrop Grumman and 11 Colombian military and police. Two FARC members were arrested. This trick to the FARC was presented by the Colombian government as a proof that the guerrilla organisation and influence is declining. On October 26, 2008, after 8 years of captivity, the ex- congressman √ìscar Tulio Lizcano escaped with the assistance of a FARC rebel he convinced to travel with him. Soon after the liberation of this prominent political hostage, the Vice President of Colombia Francisco Santos Calder√≥n called Latin America's biggest guerrilla group a \\"paper tiger\\" with little control of the nation's territory, adding that \\"they have really been diminished to the point where we can say they are a minimal threat to Colombian security,\\" and that \\"After six years of going after them, reducing their income and promoting reinsertion of most of their members, they look like a paper tiger.\\" However, he warned against any kind of premature triumphalism, because \\"crushing the rebels will take time.\\" The of jungle in Colombia makes it hard to track them down to fight. According to the Colombian government, in early 2009 FARC launched plan Rebirth to avoid being defeated. They planned to intensify guerrilla warfare by the use of landmines, snipers, and bomb attacks in urban areas. They also plan to buy missiles to fight the Colombian airforce which highly contribute to their weakness since few years. In February 2009, the guerrilla released 6 hostages as a humanitarian gesture. In March, they released Swedish hostage Erik Roland Larsson. In April 2009, the Colombian armed forces launched Strategic Leap, an offensive in borders areas where the FARC's forces still has a strong military presence, especially in Arauca, near the Venezuelan border. In November 2009, Nine Colombian soldiers were killed when their post was attacked by FARC guerrillas in a southwestern part of the country. On December 22, 2009, FARC rebels raided the home of Provincial governor Luis Francisco Cu√©llar, killing one police officer and wounding two. Cuellar was found dead the following day. =2010‚Äì2016= On January 1, 2010, Eighteen FARC rebels were killed when the Colombian Air Force bombed a jungle camp in Southern Colombia. Colombian troops of the elite Task Force Omega then stormed the camp, capturing fifteen FARC rebels, as well as 25 rifles, war materials, explosives, and information which was given to military intelligence. In Southwestern Colombia, FARC rebels ambushed an army patrol, killing a soldier. The troops then exchanged fire with the rebels. During the fighting, a teenager was killed in the crossfire. When Juan Manuel Santos was elected president in August 2010, he promised to \\"continue the armed offensive\\" against rebel movements. In the month after his inauguration, FARC and ELN killed roughly 50 soldiers and policemen in attacks all over Colombia. September also saw the killing of FARC's second-in-command Mono Jojoy. By the end of 2010, it became increasingly clear that \\"neo-paramilitary groups\\", referred to as \\"criminal groups\\" (BACRIM) by the government, had become an increasing threat to national security, with violent groups such as Los Rastrojos and Aguilas Negras taking control of large parts of the Colombian countryside. In 2010, the FARC killed at least 460 members of the security forces, while wounding more than 2,000. By early 2011, Colombian authorities and news media reported that the FARC and the clandestine sister groups have partly shifted strategy from guerrilla warfare to \\"a war of militias\\", meaning that they are increasingly operating in civilian clothes while hiding amongst sympathizers in the civilian population. In early January 2011, the Colombian army said that the FARC has some 18,000 members, with 9,000 of those forming part of the militias. The army says it has \\"identified\\" at least 1,400 such militia members in the FARC-strongholds of Valle del Cauca and Cauca in 2011. In June 2011, Colombian chief of staff Edgar Cely claimed that the FARC wants to \\"urbanize their actions\\", which could partly explain the increased guerrilla activity in Medell√≠n and particularly Cali. Jeremy McDermott, co-director of Insight Crime, estimates that FARC may have some 30,000 \\"part-time fighters\\" in 2011, consisting of supporters making up the rebel militia network instead of armed uniformed combatants. In 2011, the Colombian Congress issued a statement claiming that the FARC has a \\"strong presence\\" in roughly one third of Colombia, while their attacks against security forces \\"have continued to rise\\" throughout 2010 and 2011. In 2012, the Colombia Military launched The Espada de Honor War Plan, an aggressive counterinsurgency strategies that aims to dismantle FARC's structure, crippling them both militarily and financially. The plan targets FARC leadership and it is focused on eliminating 15 of the most powerful economic and military fronts.\\"Colombia's New Counterinsurgency Plan\\". InterAmerican Security Watch, March 29, 2012. Retrieved: June 8, 2012. On July 20, 2013, as peace talks were making progress, two rebel attacks on government positions killed 19 soldiers and an unspecified number of combatants. It was the deadliest day since peace talks began in November 2012. On 15 December 2014, 9 FARC guerrillas were killed in the aftermath airstrikes conducted by the Colombian air force in the Meta province. On 22 May 2015, the FARC suspended a truce after 26 of its fighters were killed in a government air and ground offensive. On 22 June 2015, a Colombian Army Black Hawk helicopter was destroyed while landing on a mine field laid by FARC: four soldiers were killed and six were wounded. On 23 June 2016, the Colombian government and FARC agreed to a ceasefire. A \\"final, full and definitive accord\\" was agreed to on August 24, 2016. This accord does not include ELN. On 2 October 2016, the results of the referendum to decide whether or not to support the peace accord showed that 50.2% opposed the accord while 49.8% favoured it. In October 2016, President Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his resolute efforts to bring the country's more than 50-year-long war to an end. The Colombian government and the FARC on November 24 signed a revised peace deal and the revised agreement will be submitted to Congress for approval. The House of Representatives unanimously approved the plan on November 30, a day after the Senate also gave its backing. =2017‚Äì2019= In September 2019, Colombia's President Iv√°n Duque M√°rquez launched a new military crackdown against FARC, which declared resuming the armed struggle due to the government's failure to abide by the 2016 peace deal. =2020‚Äìpresent= On April 25, senior Gulf's Cartel (Clan de Golfo) leader Gustavo Adolfo √Ålvarez T√©llez, who was one of Colombia's most wanted drug lords and had bounty of up to 580 million pesos for his capture, was arrested at his lavish estate in Ceret√© while holding a party under quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic.https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl;=es&u;=https://www.elheraldo.co/region- caribe/por-una-fiesta-en-cerete-ubicaron-supuesto-capo-del- narcotrafico-721011&prev;=searchhttps://today.rtl.lu/news/world/a/1507820.html √Ålvarez was described as the \\"brain\\" of the cartel, and by this point was reported to have taken charge of the cartel's Caribbean operations.https://caracol.com.co/emisora/2020/04/26/monteria/1587852736_119612.html On June 26, Clan del Golfo and FARC dissidents were confirmed be in a direct armed conflict in northern Antioquia known as Operation Mil.https://caracol.com.co/emisora/2020/06/27/medellin/1593219073_729114.html The Gulf's Clan, which dispatched 1,000 of its paramilitaries from Urab√°, southern C√≥rdoba and Choc√≥, hopes to remove FARC dissent from northern Antioquia and take control of the entire municipality of Ituango.  FARC dissidents  FARC dissidents are a group formerly part of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, who have refused to lay down their arms after the FARC-government peace treaty came into effect in 2016. The dissidents number some 1200 armed combatants with an unknown number of civilian militia supporting them. The FARC dissidents have become \\"an increasing headache\\" for the Colombian armed forces, as they have to fight them, the EPL, ELN and Clan del Golfo at the same time. FARC dissidents are led by former mid-level commanders such as alias Gentil Duarte, alias Euclides Mora, alias John 40, alias Giovanny Chuspas and alias Juli√°n Chollo. The FARC dissidents have been responsible for several attacks on the Colombian armed forces. These fighters are believed to be heavily involved in the production and sale of cocaine. Dissidents of FARC's 1st Front are located in the eastern plains of Colombia. Jhon 40 and their dissident 43rd Front moved into the Amazonas state of western Venezuela. Venezuela has served as the primary location for many FARC dissidents. On 15 July 2018, the Colombian and Peruvian governments launched a joint military effort known as Operation Armageddon to combat FARC dissidents. Peru issued a 60-day state of emergency in the Putumayo Province, an area bordering both Colombia and Ecuador. On the first day alone, more than 50 individuals were arrested in the operation, while four cocaine labs were dismantled. The group has attempted to recruit locals in the Putumayo Province in Peru to take up their cause.  Economic impact  = Direct economic effects =  Physical Infrastructure  The destruction of physical infrastructure has represented high costs for several sectors of the economy, directly altering production and distribution networks. The costs generated by damage to the oil infrastructure have shown a substantial increase since 1990. This is mainly explained by the increase in attacks on oil pipelines by groups outside the law. According to data from Ecopetrol, between 1999 and 2003, the costs assumed by the hydrocarbon exploitation sector grew by approximately 59%, amounting to $817,654.5 million. This equates to 23.6% of the total royalties that Ecopetrol turned to 20 departments and 110 municipalities, destined to improve the quality of life of the inhabitants. For 2004, costs decreased substantially to $11,015.5 million. This is the first sector most affected by the terrorist actions of groups outside the law. The costs are mainly derived from the spilled oil, \\"[...] from the repair of the pipeline, from the environmental decontamination and from the oil stopped producing 60% of the total expenses incurred.\\" During the 1999‚Äì2003 period, costs against electrical and telecommunications towers increased substantially, representing $134,871.2 million. This is equivalent to 5.4% of 2003 GDP for the electricity, gas and water sector. On the other hand, according to data from the National Institute of Roads (INV√çAS), between 1993‚Äì1995, groups outside the law demolished eleven tolls and a bridge, and its reconstruction cost $378,476,248. This amount increased significantly during the 1999‚Äì2003 period, when the costs generated by the reconstruction of bridges represented $18,455.7 million. These costs are equivalent to 1.71% of the total INV√çAS budget for 2003. For 2004, costs for damages to the road infrastructure dropped substantially to $680 million. The partial interruption of the roads directly affects the transport sector, food and other private guilds, which in turn assume costs for these damages. However, generally these have not been quantified, because of the difficulty they have to be directly calculated. This tends to present itself as a generalized problem in quantifying the costs associated with conflict. This is explained, in part, by the tendency in the various economic sectors not to denounce this type of actions that, in one way or another, interrupt the normal functioning of economic activities.  The costs of kidnaps and extortions  Colombia is the country in which more people are and have been kidnapped. Kidnapping, as one of the manifestations that underlie the armed conflict, carries both direct and indirect costs. The former comprise mainly the payment of ransoms and the expenses assumed by the State to control and prevent it. Indirect costs include, \\"[...] the loss of human capital for the duration of the detention and for the death of the kidnapped during his captivity\\". There are two types of kidnapping: a) kidnapping for extortion and political purposes; and b) simple kidnapping. According to data from the Directorate of Justice and Security of the DNP, this phenomenon shows an increasing trend. With respect to the costs of sequestration, the sources suggest an increasing behavior between 1996 and 2003. In such a way that \\"the average annual growth rate is 9.3%, the highest rate is observed in 1998 (46.2%), and in 2000 (37.2%) year in which the number of kidnappings also it is significantly high [...] reaching its peak in the year 2000 with 1,938 cases.\\" From then on, the trend becomes decreasing (except for a peak in 2002 with 1,542 cases) until reaching the 350 kidnappings (the lowest figure since 1996) in 2005. Within these costs, 64.4% are direct, representing US$167.4 million. 35.6% of the remaining costs are indirect, and represent US$92.7 million. In 2004, the costs of sequestration were reduced to $109,519 million, representing 0.27% of GDP in 2003.  Costs of Defense and National Security  While spending on defense and security becomes very important to examine when dealing with a country immersed in an armed conflict, the analysis on this issue are relatively recent. This can be explained because until the beginning of the second half of the nineties, defense and security spending had a significant growth. Spending on defense and security includes, on the one hand, the means by which the State must have to defend sovereignty and territorial integrity, and on the other, the costs involved in maintaining internal security. Various studies of National Planning suggest that the Colombian State spends a much greater percentage in defense and security than other Latin American countries. Between 1991‚Äì1996, the estimated value of these resources was $3.7 billion. That is, 2.6% of GDP, while for Latin America the average of this expenditure was 1.7% of GDP. A study carried out by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) for the year 2001 \\"[...] shows that Colombia ranked 24th in the countries with the largest participation in military spending, out of a total of 116 investigated.\\"The figure for the participation of military expenditures in GDP was 3.8% for Colombia while in the countries of the American continent the closest figure is that of the United States with 3.1% followed by Chile with 2.9%, Ecuador with 2.1% and the rest of countries below 2.0% \\". Thus, for the period 1999‚Äì2003, defense and security spending was $8,463,611.0 million, equivalent to 10.5% of GDP in 2003. The excess of said expense, compared to the average cost of neighboring countries, It was close to 0.79% of GDP. A Fedesarrollo study states that the Spending on defense and security carried out during 2004 \\"[...] represented 4.5% of GDP [...] \\" which does not have precedents in the history of Colombia. This is directly related to the Security Policy Democratic undertaken by the government of the current president √Ålvaro Uribe, who focuses on hitting militarily to groups outside the law, in order to regain security national. On the other hand, for the year 2004, the expenses of the Colombian Government in war and security were 6.59%, placing the country between the tenth that invest the most in war as proportion of GDP . = Indirect economic effects =  Productivity loss  The estimated loss of human capital and productivity due to labor absenteeism in 2003 amounted to $366.2 billion\\". On the other hand, the loss of land productivity, which translates into a negative impact on administration, investment in physical and social capital, and the price of land in subsectors such as livestock and commercial agriculture is one of the consequences associated with the presence of an armed conflict. This cost is mainly assumed by farmers who experience the pressure of armed actions in their areas of operation. Within this context, the most serious consequences are related to the devaluation of the properties, the loss of productivity of the land -represented in the products that could potentially have been cultivated in these lands- and the difficulty in managing the efficient production of the lands. According to a study of National Planning, the estimated costs for the loss of productivity of land represented, between 1999 and 2003, $140,443.5 million, equivalent to 1.28% of the GDP of the agricultural sector of 2003.  Impact on income distribution  The duration and expansion of the national conflict has had a significant impact on the distribution of income and wealth in Colombia. According to an investigation by the CEDE of the Universidad de los Andes, \\"as a result of the displacement, the displaced households have left behind a little more than four million hectares, which correspond to 6.7 times of the total hectares granted by the program. of Agrarian Reform during the period between 1993 and 2000, and represent a total value of $ 2.6 billion.\\" In this context, the enormous concentration of rural property in the hands of a few individuals is not only the result of the purchase of land by drug traffickers and the illegal appropriation by groups outside the law, but also the consequence of acquisition of properties devalued due to the armed conflict [...]. It is estimated that 1.3% of the owners control 48% of the best lands. On the other hand, a study carried out by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) states that the Colombian conflict has had a negative effect on the income of the population. According to this study, because of the conflict, Colombia has lost 17% of its per capita income in the last ten years. That is to say, \\"[...] the money wasted every year corresponds to about 4.6 times what the community welfare homes programs, children's homes and school restaurants of the social support network cos.\\"  Decrease in investments  Although the agents adjust their investment behavior, that is, they internalize the phenomenon of violence, assuming it as a change in the structures of the economy in the long term the investment of both the State and the private sector is diminished in substantial ways. In the Colombian case, the loss in private investment has been estimated at 0.53 points of the annual GDP, due to the public order conditions that arise directly from the presence of an armed conflict. A 1% increase in the homicide rate reduces private investment by 0.66%. Thus, we can observe that the high levels of violence directly affect the transaction costs and levels of uncertainty in society. Likewise, they reduce to a certain degree the profitability of investments. A study by Corporaci√≥n Invertir en Colombia (Coinvertir) and the National Planning Department (DNP) shows that insecurity hinders the development of new foreign investments, especially in the financial, oil and gas, and electric power sectors. One of the biggest problems to invest in Colombia is that it is necessary to devote a large part of the budget to security and protection controls, which is very difficult to justify before the house. In this sense, the economic environment affected by the violence translates into a tax on investment.\\" On the other hand, within the studies on the costs of the conflict, specific sectors such as the private sector have begun to be studied, taking into account the high costs they have had to assume due to the existence of this phenomenon. The large companies and those that operate at the national level assume the highest costs associated with the existence of the conflict. This is because they are more attractive for someone who wants to extort for example, and also those who lose most in adverse conditions. Appealing to the economic arguments that underlie the conflict, various state and international aid and cooperation institutions seek to establish the scope and potential benefits of a peaceful situation. This argument has mobilized and sensitized various sectors of society to understand that peace is also an economic necessity. In Colombia, as shown in the studies that have estimated the costs of the conflict, since the nineties it has imposed increasingly higher costs to various productive sectors of the economy and society in general. Among the sectors most affected by the conflict are the exploitation of hydrocarbons, electricity and livestock. This is explained, in part, because the areas where the operations and activities of these sectors take place, in parallel, are the territories where groups outside the law exert a very strong presence. Likewise, for the Colombian private sector, indirect costs have more impact on their activities than direct costs. With respect to indirect costs, although there is a clear difficulty to be quantified, the various studies suggest that they have been significantly high and that they have had a representative impact on society as such.  Role of the United States  US General William P. Yarborough was the head of a counterinsurgency team sent to Colombia in 1962 by the US Special Warfare Center. Yarborough was one of the earliest proponents of \\"paramilitary [...] and/or terrorist activities against known communist proponents\\". The United States has been heavily involved in the conflict since its beginnings, when in the early 1960s the U.S. government encouraged the Colombian military to attack leftist militias in rural Colombia. This was part of the U.S. fight against communism. In October 1959, the United States sent a \\"Special Survey Team\\", composed of counterinsurgency experts, to investigate Colombia's internal security situation.Rempe, 1995 In February 1962, a Fort Bragg top-level U.S. Special Warfare team headed by Special Warfare Center commander General William P. Yarborough, visited Colombia for a second survey.Livingstone, 2004: p. 155 In a secret supplement to his report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Yarborough encouraged the creation and deployment of a paramilitary force to commit sabotage and terrorist acts against communists: Colin Powell, then the US Secretary of State, visiting Colombia as part of the United States' support of Plan Colombia The first paramilitary groups were organized following recommendations made by U.S. military counterinsurgency advisers who were sent to Colombia during the Cold War to combat leftist political activists and armed guerrilla groups. One multinational corporation has also been directly tied to paramilitary death squads. Chiquita Brands International was fined $25 million as part of a settlement with the United States Justice Department for having ties to paramilitary groups. In 2016, Judge Kenneth Marra of the Southern District of Florida ruled in favor of allowing Colombians to sue former Chiquita Brand International executives for the company's funding of the outlawed right-wing paramilitary organization that murdered their family members. He stated in his decision that \\"'profits took priority over basic human welfare' in the banana company executives' decision to finance the illegal death squads, despite knowing that this would advance the paramilitaries' murderous campaign.\\"Families Of Death Squad Victims Allowed To Sue Chiquita Executives . CommonDreams. 4 June 2016. In December 2013, The Washington Post revealed a covert CIA program, started in the early 2000s, which provides the Colombian government with intelligence and GPS guidance systems for smart bombs. As of August, 2004, the US had spent $3 billion in Colombia, more than 75% of it on military aid. Before the Iraq war, Colombia was the third largest recipient of US aid only after Egypt and Israel, and the U.S. has 400 military personnel and 400 civilian contractors in Colombia. Currently, however, Colombia is not a top recipient of U.S. aid; while it was under the first five years of the Plan Colombia, Colombia today no longer ranks among the top ten. In March 2015, it was revealed DEA agents were participating in drug cartel-funded sex parties with prostitutes. Agents were provided with expensive gifts, weapons and money from drug cartel members. The head of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, Michele Leonhart announced her retirement. Leonhart's tenure as DEA Administrator was marked with controversy and scandals including a prostitution scandal. If the peace talks underway in Havana are successful in bringing peace to Colombia, this U.S. aid to the military will likely need to be reallocated to help support a lasting peace.Ending 50 Years of Conflict in Colombia: The Challenges Ahead and the U.S. Role , WOLA, 4/14/2014. Colombia rejects threats and blackmail of the United States of America after the threat of Donald Trump to decertify the country as a partner in counter-narcotics efforts.  Statistics about victims of war  The of Peace and Memory: A \\"memorial\\" to the victims of the conflict. In Colombia, the 9th of April is a symbolic day. It is a day of remembrance and solidarity with the conflict's victims. According to a study by Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory, 220,000 people have died in the conflict between 1958 and 2013, most of them civilians (177,307 civilians and 40,787 fighters) and more than five million civilians were forced from their homes between 1985 ‚Äì 2012, generating the world's second largest population of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The report shows that the humanitarian crisis in Colombia is extremely serious in terms of both lethal and nonlethal violence. The report examines the widespread use of sexual violence against women and girls as a weapon of war, as well as the invisibility of this phenomenon. 16.9% of the population in Colombia has been a direct victim of the war. 2.3 million children have been displaced from their homes, and 45,000 children killed, according to national figures cited by Unicef. In total, one in three of the 7.6 million registered victims of the conflict are children, and since 1985, 8,000 minors have disappeared. Since the peace talks with the FARC began four years ago, some 1,000 children have been forcibly recruited by some of the myriad armed groups in the country, 75 have been killed, and 65 schools have been damaged by fighting. According to the report \\"Basta ya\\", written in 2013 by Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory, 80% of victims affected by conflict-related violence and landmines were civilians. The report documents 1,982 massacres between 1980 and 2012. The Government also began a process of assistance, attention and comprehensive reparation for victims of conflict. During his visit to Colombia, Pope Francis brought with him a message of peace and paid tribute to the victims of the conflict. The Special Jurisdiction of Peace (Jurisdicci√≥n Especial para la Paz, JEP) would be the transitional justice component of the Comprehensive System, complying with Colombia's duty to investigate, clarify, prosecute and punish serious human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law which occurred during the armed conflict. Its objectives would be to satisfy victims' right to justice, offer truth to the public, contribute to the reparation of victims, contribute to the fight against impunity, adopt decisions which give full legal security to direct and indirect participants in the conflict and contribute to the achievement of a stable and lasting peace. The Special Unit for the Search of Missing Persons in the context and due to the armed conflict (Unidad especial para la b√∫squeda de personas dadas por desaparecidas en el contexto y en raz√≥n del conflicto armado) would be a special high-level unit created following the signature of the final agreement. It would direct and coordinate efforts to search for and locate missing persons, or find their remains so that they may be returned to their families. To carry out its work, the search unit would collect the necessary information about missing persons, analyze the information collected, strengthen and streamline processes for identifying mortal remains in coordination with the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, guarantee families' participation and present an official report to families informing them of the fate of missing relatives. The search unit would be administrative and financially independent and autonomous, complementing the other components of the Comprehensive System. Use of land mines Since 1990, over 11,000 people have been killed or wounded by landmines in Colombia. Between 1982 and the end of 2012, 2,038 people have been killed by landmines, according to the Presidential Program for Mine Action. Since 2000, casualties from landmines in Colombia have ranged from 1,300 a year to just around 550. In the past, the Colombian government laid landmines around 34 military bases to protect key infrastructure, but it renounced their use in 1997. Landmines are primarily used by the rebel groups to protect their home bases and illegal drug crops, which fund the conflict. FARC and ELN have deployed antipersonnel mines throughout an estimated area of up to 100 square kilometers. In March 2015, FARC stated that it would begin humanitarian demining in selected parts of Colombia.

The lesbian activist Gail Vivino volunteered to use the basement of her Charles Village apartment at 2745 N. Calvert Street to host the production space for the newspaper, as well as the switchboard for the GLCCB. The production space later moved into a building at 241 West Chase Street. The editor and co-founder of the newspaper was Louise Kelley, a lesbian and feminist activist who wrote for Women's Express, served as a board member for the Chase Brexton clinic, worked on the Schmoke administration's Task Force on Gay and Lesbian Issues, and coordinate women's activities for the GLCCB. In 2016, Gay Life was purchased from the GLCCB and merged into the LGBT newspaper Baltimore OUTloud.

Earlier models of HICAS (hydraulic versions of HICAS) did not depend only on the high speeds using the speedometer but were used to maneuver at lower speeds through obstacles. After disabling HICAS, it has been noted that slow maneuvers including parking and quick response steering seemed more difficult. Earlier HICAS versions used hydraulics to steer the rear wheels. The hydraulic system was powered by the power steering pump and used speed sensors to determine how much and in which direction to steer the rear wheels.

The Express was powered by a Westinghouse J46 engine and hit the 413 mph record mark.Air & Space Magazine,March 01, 2009, Oldies and Oddities: The Bonneville Jet WarsAir & Space Magazine,March 01, 2009, Oldies and Oddities: The Bonneville Jet Wars Photos History At a trade fair in Gary, Indiana in 1962, Arfons met Green, chief engineer for a torque wrench manufacturer. Although Green's only racing experience had been a year of stock car racing in New Mexico ten years previously, he was greatly interested in aerodynamics; this dovetailed perfectly with Arfons' interest in racing mechanics, and \\"Within ten minutes we were planning our assault on the world's land speed record\\" Green recalls. Green shortly provided plans for a three-wheeled land speed record car, which had to be changed to four wheels to meet FIA rules; from there on there was little change until the car was finished. Green's emphasis was on reducing aerodynamic drag by lowering the drag coefficient and, especially, reducing frontal area by narrowing the track and using smaller wheels. His calculations indicated that the readily available surplus Westinghouse J46 jet engines would have more than enough power to drive the vehicle to over 400 miles per hour (640 km/h). In order to find funding, Arfons and Green approached Goodyear, who were already funding Craig Breedlove's Spirit of America. In a presentation to 13 Goodyear executives Green emphasized his aerodynamic analyses, estimating that the wheel-driven Bluebird CN7 would be limited to 400 mph (640 km/h) and Nathan Ostich's revolutionary jet-powered Flying Caduceus to only 360 mph (580 km/h), but that their design should hit 480 mph (770 km/h), the target Breedlove was also going for. Although Spirit of America had a lower coefficient of drag, Green's design had a smaller frontal area and weighed slightly more than half as much. This, along with a thrust of 7,000 pounds force (31 kN) available from the J46 engine with afterburner, compared to only 4,400 pounds force (20 kN) available from Breedlove's J47 engine would make their design viable. When the Flying Caduceus frustrated Ostich's team by refusing to go any faster than 355 miles per hour (571 km/h), Green's mastery of the subject was evident enough that Goodyear decided to fund his project in addition to Breedlove's; thus the name, Wingfoot Express, from Goodyear's trademark winged foot, inspired by a statue of Mercury. (In 1964 Bluebird CN7 demonstrated a final speed of over 440 mph, even when limited by poor surface conditions, invalidating Green's estimate.) However, although Spirit Of America had a $250,000 budget and Bluebird CN7 more than $2,000,000, Arfons and Green's car cost only $78,000. Wingfoot Express' cockpit was located centrally, just behind the front axle, covered with an acrylic glass canopy from in front of the driver's feet to behind his head. The front wheels were mounted within the bodywork barely further apart than the width of the engine, while the rear wheels were on outriggers and exposed to the air. Green estimated that the aerodynamic drag of the exposed rear wheels cost the car 20 miles per hour (30 km/h), but since his calculations indicated that they already had much greater speed available than they needed, this was not viewed as a problem. A small fin rose vertically at the tip of the car's nose. Veteran drag racer Arfons was to drive the car for the record attempt, but a month before the scheduled run, during initial testing on a dragstrip with Arfons outside the car observing, the two braking parachutes ripped loose and the car \\"knifed through a chain link fence at 200 mph (320 km/h), ripped across a highway, jumped two four-foot (1.2 m) ditches and plunged 75 feet (25 m) into a wooded area. Only 300 feet (100 m) of fence that had become entangled in her rear wheels stopped her\\", according to Green. Although the driver was unhurt \\"when Walt saw the Wingfoot heading for oblivion he had a heart attack on the spot\\" and was briefly hospitalized, but released himself in order to repair the car. In the process, he damaged the ligaments in one hand, completely eliminating whatever small chance remained of his driving the car for the record. At this point there was no time to find another driver, and Green, who had never driven over 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) in his life, was the logical choice because of his familiarity with the mechanics of the vehicle. At Bonneville, Green began his Land Speed Record career by easing the car around \\"the parking area\\" like any student driver. On his first timed run he hit 236 miles per hour (380 km/h), but \\"I hadn't fully anticipated that I'd have the feeling of rattling and banging down the black line like a rock in a can...the salt was a little rough....\\". \\"at 250 mph [400 km/h] the upholstery of the seat hugged me like a pressure suit, at 275 [440 km/h] I had the weird feeling it was snowing in the cockpit!\\" The \\"snow\\" was flakes of salt which were being sucked into the cockpit by the vagaries of the aerodynamics; aside from being distracting, this brought up fears that the air pressure might crack or even completely shatter or remove the cockpit at speed. At higher speed, the short front axle began to oscillate, necessitating an increase in the damping of the shock absorbers; but after that last modification, Green found that he could steer with one hand; \\"I never drifted more than 8 feet [2.4 m] from the black line\\". The first run using the afterburner sent the car well over 300 miles per hour (480 km/h); when it was shut down Green felt as if he had \\"slammed on the brakes, but the airspeed indicator showed that I was still accelerating under regular engine power\\". That run hit 335 miles per hour (539 km/h) before salt crystals drawn into the engine threw it off balance. Having only three days total booked at Bonneville, the team had to vacate for Craig Breedlove, who set the record at 400 miles per hour (644 km/h); leading to an intense debate within the FIA about what constituted a car, resulting in the unusual decision that Breedlove's three-wheeled jet vehicle was actually a motorcycle. In 1964, Wingfoot Express returned to Bonneville for a week, but the engine never regained the strength shown in their earliest runs, and struggled to pick up speed. Even when another engine was installed, success eluded them. Finally, Walt's brother and longtime competitor Art Arfons, a brilliant intuitive mechanic for both piston and jet engines, suggested that the 17 inch (432 mm) opening of the \\"clamshells\\" on the engine exhaust was the problem. \\"it was a 1/16 turn of the idle adjustment on the engine and opening of the afterburner clamshells to 19 inches (483 mm) that brought the engine up to record performance\\", Green recalls. Green also removed some of the sheet metal around the engine intake, later realizing that in the process he had destroyed the Goodyear logo. But the Wingfoot Express now easily hit 299 miles per hour (481 km/h) with no afterburner. On the last day they had available, October 2, 1964, at 4:06 pm, a short blast of afterburner brought the car to a recorded 406 mph (653 km/h), but the official record required the run be \\"backed up\\" in the opposite direction. The lateness of the hour left no time for refueling, so the decision was made to save fuel by not making a full run over the entire distance for acceleration, and the car started the return run only 2 miles (3 km) away from the timing lights. Green and the car accelerated like a rocket, recording a remarkable speed of 420.07 miles per hour (676.04 km/h), thus averaging 413.20 miles per hour (664.98 km/h) in both directions and setting a new record not quite 2% faster than Breedlove's. Within 3 days, however, the record had been reset by Art Arfons. Although the final record run had demonstrated that Wingfoot Express clearly had much more speed available, Green decided to not push his luck and retired from competition, returning to his regular job. He is today a vice president of the company, which used to produce torque wrenches for Snap-On. He continues to maintain contact with Arfons and they meet periodically. \\"I did offer to help Walt with his rocket car but the design was his own\\". Walt Arfons went on alone to build Wingfoot Express 2 using solid-fuel rockets; peak power and acceleration was enormous, but could not be maintained long enough to set a record over the measured distance. Wingfoot Express 2 started with 10 JATO rocket bottles, and made an unofficial speed record of 605 mph with 25 JATO bottles in 1965.\\"Jet Assisted Chevy\\" in TV program 'Mythbusters' aired on 22 Feb. 2009 Neither knows what happened to the original Wingfoot Express, or where it might now be.

He is widely considered among the most prominent figures of Greek contemporary musical culture, with more than 70 personal albums and with sales of more than 15 million records to date. He has been selected as a Goodwill Ambassador for the UN Refugee Agency. He was born in Nea Kokinia, Piraeus. His father was Loukas Daralas (difference in surname spelling), a singer of rebetiko. Early career Dalaras' first song, \\"Œ†œÅŒøœÉŒºŒøŒΩŒÆ\\" (Prosmoni, \\"expectation\\"), was recorded in 1967. The single never reached any popular status, in fact it was barely released. Dalaras even had to struggle to get into the studio, as ironically the day he began his studio career was the day that the Greek military junta took over the streets of Athens, and the roads were littered with tanks. After several appearances on various recordings as a guest singer, his debut album was released in early 1969, a self-titled album released on the Minos label. The recording included many compositions by Stavros Kouyioumtzis, who in the early years proved a fountain of help towards Dalaras achieving musical success. As Dalaras has said in various interviews, he owes the fact that he became a singer to Kouyioumtzis, who composed Dalaras' first songs. His relation with Kouyioumtzis remained friendly until the sudden death of the composer due to a heart attack in March 2005. The biggest hit of the record, \\"Œ†ŒøœÖ 'ŒΩŒ±Œπ œÑŒ± œáœÅœåŒΩŒπŒ±\\" (Pou 'ne ta chronia, \\"Where are the years?\\"), is still sung today, and is regarded as a mainstay in Dalaras' large repertoire. In 1970, he released the album \\"ŒùŒ± 'œÑŒ±ŒΩŒµ œÑŒø 21 \\" (Na 'tane to ikosi-ena, \\"If only it were '21\\", that is, 1821, a reference to the Greek War of Independence). The album was immediately more successful than his debut LP and included hits such as \\"Na 'tane to 21'\\", \\"ŒöŒ¨œÄŒøœÖ ŒΩœÖœáœÑœéŒΩŒµŒπ\\" (\\"Kapou nichtoni\\", Somewhere the night falls), and an instrumental version of \\"Pou 'ne ta chronia\\". The album was made up entirely of a compositions by Stavros Kouyioumtzis. The songs were mainly reinterpretations, as was common in the late 60s for new Greek singers; however, not all the songs on their first release (most of them on the smaller yet more distinctive LYRA label) had proved successful, and in many instances, even now, many people in Greece believe that the Dalaras songs are originals and not cover versions. First gold album In 1972, Dalaras, along with singer Haris Alexiou, received his big break in the Greek music industry when their LP \\"ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅŒ¨ ŒëœÉŒØŒ±\\" (Mikra Asia, Asia Minor) went gold, his first album to do so. The songs were written by Apostolos Kaldaras, a heavyweight in the la√Øk√≥ scene of the 50s and 60s, who at this time decided to enter the political fray of Greek music. Dalaras and Alexiou were immediately thrown into the limelight. The LP was also recently re-released in both CD and limited edition LP format by Minos-EMI. The Mikra Asia LP was followed up by \\"ŒíœÖŒ∂Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩœåœÇ ŒïœÉœÄŒµœÅŒπŒΩœåœÇ\\" (Vizantinos Esperinos, Byzantine Vespers) in 1973. The album consisted again of Dalaras and Haris Alexiou, and was composed by Apostolos Kaldaras, however the lyrics were by the emerging Lefteris Papadopoulos, who had written Dalaras' first official recording. This was the last time that Dalaras officially worked with Apostolos Kaldaras in the studio, however, they worked together in live performances. Unlike Mikra Asia, Vizantinos Esperinos did not meet with exceptional sales, and is somewhat 'forgotten' in the repertoire of Dalaras's songs. Rebetiko revival After several LPs and further collaborations with Kouyioumtzis, Kaldaras, Manos Lo√Øzos, Mikis Theodorakis and others, Dalaras decided to release his own renditions of rebetiko songs on the double LP \\"50 ŒßœÅœåŒΩŒπŒ± Œ°ŒµŒºœÄŒ≠œÑŒπŒ∫Œø Œ§œÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒ¥Œπ\\" (Peninta Chronia Rebetiko Tragoudi, 50 Years of Rebetiko songs), released 1975. The recording proved an immediate success, despite the toning down of the lyrics. However, as a result, a new movement was set to take place in Greek music, and the once forgotten rebetes were finding themselves performing, in some cases for the first time in 30 to 40 years. He followed up this work with an LP in 1980, \\"Œ°ŒµŒºœÄŒ≠œÑŒπŒ∫Œ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒöŒ±œÑŒøœáŒÆœÇ\\" (Rebetika tis Katohis, Rebetiko (songs) of the occupation), which was a more gritty and meaty release, more faithful to the tone of the original rebetika as heard in the 1930s. However, again references to drugs were cut out, and only mentioned in passing. Unlike the previous double LP, this one contained some of the original musicians, Bayianteras and Genitsaris in particular making an appearance on the album. Collaborations and styles Since the 1960s, Dalaras has recorded more than 120 records. He has sung numerous different Greek music styles (e.g. rebetiko, la√Øk√≥, Latin, pop), Israeli and Arabic music, and religious music. He has collaborated with many contemporary Greek composers, including Mikis Theodorakis, Stavros Kouyioumtzis, Manos Loizos, Apostolos Kaldaras, Stavros Xarhakos, Manos Hadjidakis and Christos Nikolopoulos. He also discovered and supported young Areti Ketime, producing her first album. Apart from his prominent singing career, Dalaras is considered to be one a talented musician as he plays most of the stringed instruments of a Greek folk band with great success, including the guitar, bouzouki, baglamas, tzouras and outi. He has accompanied Al Di Meola and Paco de Luc√≠a, among others. Dalaras' most important projects include collaborations with several international singers, including British singer Sting, releasing together a duet of Sting's song Mad About You. He has also collaborated with Pyx Lax, Bruce Springsteen, Jethro Tull, Yehuda Poliker, Emma Shapplin, Goran Bregovic, Apostolis Anthimos, Dulce Pontes, Andriana Babali and many others. Dalaras moved from his homestay label of Minos EMI in favour of Universal Music Greece in 2006, thus ending an almost 40 year collaboration. In 2000, Dalaras discovered a new local orchestra that specialized at traditional Smirneiko (from Smyrna) and Rebetiko songs. The orchestra's name was \\"ŒïœÉœÑŒøœÖŒ¥ŒπŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØŒΩŒ± ŒùŒ≠Œ±œÇ ŒôœâŒΩŒØŒ±œÇ\\" (Estoudiantina Neas Ionias and it came from Nea Ionia, a city near Volos. Dalaras pulled Estoudiantina in the light of publicity and make it known to the Greek public. Since then Estoudiantina has become one of the most important and famous orchestras in Greece. Estoudiantina's repertoire now also includes Modern Greek, Greek Laiko, and Mediterranean. The big orchestras Dalaras is a Greek traveler, an exceptional interpreter, a restless musician who deeply believes in the individual character of Greek music, in its power and its competence and, at the same time, in its global quality. His relentless pursuits journeyed Greece to the end of the world while, his conviction that the multinational model is based on the mutual possession of the artistic heritage has fused his interpretation abilities with the dexterity of a number of the most renowned orchestras of the world. *The famous Dutch Metropole Orchestra is the first big orchestra with which George Dalaras collaborated. It was an exciting artistic gathering which took place in 1995, in the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, under the direction of Dick Baker. It consisted of two musical performances which moved and captivated the public through a song list which was dedicated to the soundtracks and the songs by Mikis Theodorakis the performances were recorded live and, consequently, released by EMI CLASSICS in fifteen countries, in an album titled \\"GEORGE DALARAS & METROPOLE ORCHESTRA\\". *The artist‚Äôs next collaboration with one of the most prominent and long-existent choirs in Europe took part when, in 1996, he interpreted Ariel Ramirez Misa Criolla Mass accompanied by the choir of the Deutsche Oper Berlin in the Berlin Opera. It was a much anticipated concert since, the tickets had long been sold out and, so much the daily press as well as the opera leaflets had extensively referred to the event. The fact that, the concert was transmitted live by SPF ‚Äìa radio station with a predominantly classical repertoire- is worth mentioning. *The next event was to be with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, one of the most outstanding orchestras worldwide. In 1997, the Orchestra invited George Dalaras to stage two concerts in the Tel Aviv Mann Auditorium. The orchestra was conducted by Ilias Voudouris. It was a collaboration which materialized, in the best possible way, George Dalaras‚Äô long desire to interpret a number of the most brilliant Greek songs accompanied by a symphony orchestra. The internationally acknowledged interpretation skills of the Philharmonic Orchestra came together with the powerful and charismatic stage presence, the promptness and, lastly, the soulful interpretation of George Dalaras in an unfolding of the portrait of contemporary Greek music. A musical journey which began from the rebetiko songs to cross over to his big hits, to all-time classics by prominent Greek composers, to melodies from the Mediterranean as well as to medieval songs by the Greek Jewish Sephardi population (in Ladino) The live recordings of these performances were internationally released in April 1999 by EMI CLASSICS in a digital disc titled: \\"GEORGE DALARAS AND THE ISRAEL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA\\", a release which made quite a stir. *In parallel, George Dalaras has collaborated with the Camerata - Friends of Music Orchestra in 1994, on the stage of the Athens Concert Hall in both the \\"...and by light and by death incessantly\\" and the \\"Angel Hymns in Human Rhythms\\" musical performances by Stavros Kougioumtzis under the direction of Alexandros Myrat. *In 1999, George Dalaras collaborated with the Osipov State Russian Folk Orchestra. It was a high standard collaboration which made an impression by means of its simplicity and its musicality. Thousands of spectators went for a standing ovation following George Dalaras‚Äô interpretation of songs by Greek composers as well as of ballads from the Mediterranean. These versions were magnificently executed by the Ossipov Orchestra which is one of the most famous and grand orchestras worldwide since, it manages to merge the symphonic structure with the pop and folk elements. The 70-membered orchestra -which consisted of players of balalaikas and domras- was conducted by Nikolai Kalinin. The performances were staged in the Athens Concert Hall, in Salonica, in the Patras Ancient Conservatory, in Cyprus, in London‚Äôs Queen Elizabeth Hall and, finally, in Moscow, in November 2000. *In October 1999, George Dalaras met in the famous Notre-Dame Basilica, which is situated in the old city of Montreal, with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra which was conducted by Charles Dutoit, the famous conductor. The Montreal Symphony Orchestra, which consists of distinguished soloists, was founded in 1934 and is, today, one of the biggest orchestras in the world. *In September 2000, George Dalaras collaborated, for the first time, with them BBC Concert Orchestra, one of the most outstanding British orchestras. They met at the packed theatre Odeon of Herodes Atticus in a recital of superb orchestrations for a grand orchestra under the direction of Nick Davies and the participation of Joan Faulkner, the famous American jazz singer. The concert, the tickets of which had been sold out days before, was repeated in October of the same year in London‚Äôs Royal Festival Hall with the participation of the big School *In October 2000, four concerts that were staged in Cyprus signaled George Dalaras‚Äô collaboration with the famous Kremlin Moscow State Symphony Orchestra. This was an event in which Margarita Zorbala, the exquisite performer, had also taken part. The Kremlin Symphony Orchestra consists of 70 superb soloists while, its main characteristic is the coalescence of the instrumental harmony structure with an impeccable technique and artistic expression. Pavel Ovsianikov is the artistic director and conductor of the orchestra; he is a composer who, in the course of his creative career, has managed to combine the preservation of the rich Russian cultural heritage with the quest for new musical ideas. In November 2000, they, once more, met in Russia, in a concert that was staged in Grand Kremlin Palace‚Äôs George Hall. *In June 2001, George Dalaras collaborated again with the Osipov State Russian Folk Orchestra conducted by Nikolai Kalinin. The event took place in Delphi and it was a unique concert that was part of the list of events scheduled for the celebration of the First World Refugee Day as well as for the completion of 50 years uon the founding of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Foley is regarded for her activity as an academic, cultural and community leader and for co-founding the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative. Her practice encompasses many media including painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, textiles and installation. Her work addresses contemporary political issues facing Indigenous Australians and is held in the public collections of many Australian state, national and university collections including the Cruthers Collection of Women's Art as well as the British Museum. Foley's work has toured internationally and featured in several major exhibitions including Global Feminisms at the Brooklyn Museum and Aboriginal Art in Modern Worlds at Russia's Hermitage Museum.  Biography  Fiona Foley was born in Maryborough in 1964 and raised in nearby Hervey Bay and (briefly) Mount Isa. Foley attended high school in Sydney with her siblings, and then attained a Certificate of Arts from East Sydney Technical College in 1983. She was one of the first Indigenous students to attend the Sydney College of the Arts, Sydney University completing a Bachelor of Visual Arts in 1986. The following year she completed a Diploma of Education at Sydney University. Foley's mother, Shirley Foley, was born in Urangan and was a member of the Wondunna clan of the Badtjala people who are indigenous to Thoorgine (Fraser Island). In 1988, Shirley Foley established the Thoorgine Educational and Culture Centre on the island. She spent twenty years researching and recording Badtjala language and culture, culminating in the publication of a Badtjala/English dictionary. Her mother's cultural pride and high regard for education have influenced Foley throughout her career. Her father, Gary Foley, is an Aboriginal activist and actor who collaborated on and featured in the 1977 film Backroads. Since 1985, Foley has had significant engagement with Indigenous communities in central Australia, most notably Maningrida and Ramingining in Arnhem Land. Foley and her mother visited Maningrida in 1992, facilitating a cultural exchange between locals and Badtjala people. Before this, Foley lived and worked in Ramingining for several months. These trips greatly informed her practice, provided further insights into Aboriginal culture, and inspired her to be a cultural leader. In 1995, Foley permanently moved back to Hervey Bay to be with family and take part in Native Title negotiations regarding a portion of Fraser Island. As of 2014, this claim has been successful. In 2017 Foley completed a Doctorate of Philosophy. Her research focused on The Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act, 1897. A number of her artworks have referenced this act and its effect on the Badtjala people.  Career and artistic practice  Community engagement is pertinent to Foley's art practice. She contributed to the emergence of urban Australian Indigenous Art through her participation in the seminal Koori '84 group exhibition. Following this, she was involved in the foundation of several artist co-operatives and initiatives. These include the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative and artist exchanges and collaborative workshops between Badtjala people and artists from Maningrida & Ramingining. More recently Foley‚Äôs involvement in the arts community has extended to curatorial roles. In 1994 she co-curated Tyerabarrbowaryaou II - I shall never become a white man for the Havana Biennial alongside Djon Mundine. This was the first international exhibition to be curated by Indigenous Australians. Political issues are central to Foley‚Äôs practice. Her works in public art and installation aim to examine and redress previously disregarded histories of colonisation in Australia. One such example is Edge of the Trees, a 1995 collaboration with Janet Laurence - the first major public artwork by both an Indigenous and a non-Indigenous Australian artist. In 1995 it was awarded the Lloyd Rees Award for Urban Design. The work utilises both Western and Indigenous iconographies to evidence historical conflict - both on its site (the Museum of Sydney, formerly Australia‚Äôs first Government House) and across Australia. Pukumani or tutini (funerary) poles contrast Sydney‚Äôs urban landscape and memorialise the violence that shaped early interactions with settlers on the city‚Äôs shore. Foley‚Äôs Land Deal (1995) and Lie of the Land (1997) serve as evidence and a reminder of John Batman‚Äôs now-invalidated treaty for 600,000 acres of Wurundjeri land (where Melbourne currently stands), and its basis on false premises. Similarly, Witnessing to Silence (2004) remembers all known massacres of Indigenous people within Queensland, listing 94 such sites. The corpses on these sites were hidden either by burning or submerging in bodies of water. Foley engaged in some chicanery to ensure the work‚Äôs installation, telling its commissioners (Brisbane Magistrate‚Äôs Court) that the work was about sites of natural phenomena - fire and flood. The work‚Äôs true meaning was only unveiled once installed. 2009‚Äôs Black Opium (a permanent installation across multiple rooms at the State Library of Queensland) references The Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 and the impacts of the British colonial opium trade on both Chinese and Indigenous communities. By exhibiting these works within the context of Western cultural institutions, Foley aims to evidence and embed oppressive Australian histories where they have previously been excluded. At other times Foley‚Äôs work strikes a more playful or satirical political tone. Her appropriation of ethnographic imagery and 'Aboriginalia' (kitsch objects depicting Indigenous Australians in a culturally insensitive manner) serve to critique these claims to the representation of Indigenous people. Positioning herself as both subject and author, Foley rectifies power imbalances and reconstructs an oppressive history. Works such as 1994‚Äôs Native Blood and Badtjala Woman demonstrate an aim to undermine and challenge the historical and 'scientific' sanctity of such images, whilst highlighting the West‚Äôs idealisation, sexualisation and exploitation of Indigenous culture as an exotic aesthetic. Connection to place features heavily throughout Foley‚Äôs practice. Themes of nature - sand and sea - pervade pictorial works and foreground the significance of Foley‚Äôs ancestral ties to Thoorgine (Fraser Island). The Legends of Moonie Jarl, a book written and illustrated in the 1960s by Foley‚Äôs aunt and uncle, relates numerous Badtjala creation stories that describe the animals, vegetation and weather patterns of the island. This text, her mother and her stints in Arnhem Land are considered major reference points for Foley‚Äôs 2D practice. Men's Business (1987‚Äì89), Catching Tuna (1992) and Salt Water Islands (1992) depict Foley‚Äôs experience during her time visiting the remote communities of Maningrida and Ramingining in the Northern Territory. They demonstrate the minimalism, flatness and \\"symbolic abstraction\\" that is characteristic of Foley‚Äôs pastels and paintings. Typically making use of an aerial perspective, these works privilege meditative spatiality over didactic naturalistic representations. Significantly, this counters historical ethnographic and spectatorial depictions of Indigenous culture by settlers. Contrarily, Foley‚Äôs work impresses a sense of myth, memory and dream - both personal and collective. Politically, this practice is an affirmative reclamation of symbols, narratives, cultures and histories that have previously been appropriated or erased. Foley is represented by Andrew Baker Art Dealer, Brisbane and Niagara Galleries, Melbourne.

The member schools are International School Bangkok (Thailand), International School of Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), International School Manila (Philippines), Jakarta Intercultural School (Indonesia), Singapore American School (Singapore), and Taipei American School (Taiwan). High level competitions and events involving teams or groups from the IASAS schools are held throughout the school year in areas of sports, or cultural and artistic events. Sports competitions are organized into three separate seasons, and tournaments are held at the end of approximately 10-week seasons. Cultural and Artistic events are held in separate seasons from sports, with Model United Nations during one season (non-competitive event), and the Arts events during another season. Each of the IASAS schools rotate the hosting of events, based on available facilities and current events of each country. While participating in events, students are expected to adhere to a strict code of conduct. Students traveling to other schools to participate in IASAS events stay with families of students from the host school. The events, organized by season, are listed below. Sports The first season of IASAS, held in October, includes soccer, volleyball, and cross country running. The second season of IASAS, held in January, includes basketball, rugby union (for men), touch rugby (for women), swimming, and tennis. The third season of IASAS, held in April, includes badminton, fastpitch softball (for women) and baseball (for men), golf, and track and field. In addition to the culminating IASAS events that occur at the end of each season, athletics exchanges are held during the season so that teams have an opportunity to see the competition from the other schools. These exchanges usually only involve three or four of the IASAS schools at a time, and no awards are given for winning an exchange.

Monastic order Ramakrishna Math, at Bagbazar, Kolkata Ramakrishna Math consists of monks (Sannyasins and Brahmacharins) belonging to a monastic order for men. The Ramakrishna Order (Bengali: ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡¶ï‡ßÉ‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶£ ‡¶∏‡¶Ç‡¶ò) is the monastic lineage that was founded by Ramakrishna, when he gave the ocher cloth of renunciation to twelve of his close disciples, in January 1886 at the Cossipore House.Ramakrishna and His Disciples, Christopher Isherwood, page 292 After the passing away of their Master Sri Ramakrishna in 1886 the young disciples under the leadership of Swami Vivekananda organized themselves into a new monastic order. The original monastery at Baranagar called Baranagar Math was shifted in January 1899 to a newly acquired plot of land at Belur in the district of Howrah. =Mother of the Order= Sri Sarada Devi, popularly called as Holy Mother and Sangha Janani (Mother of the Order), played a key role in the establishment of the Ramakrishna Order. During the early days, when the young monks were roaming about penniless, it was the Holy Mother who gave them encouragement, inspiration, and her prayers. Genesis =Baranagar Math= During his lifetime, Ramakrishna gathered and trained his young disciples with Narendranath (future Vivekananda) as their anointed leader. It is these disciples - some of whom were also blessed with monastic robes by Ramakrishna himself, that formed the core of a new monastic order that bears his name now. Swami Vivekananda and fifteen others were the founders of this order. After taking formal monastic vows through appropriate rituals (12 at first and the rest at different times later) they assumed new names as follows (based on seniority in age):Swami Harshananda, A Concise Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, Ramakrishna Math, Bangalore (2008) Vol.3, p.21 * Gopal - Swami Advaitananda (1828-1909) * Taraknath - Swami Sivananda (1854-1934) * Baburam - Swami Premananda (1861-1918) * Yogindra - Swami Yogananda (1861-1899) * Harinath - Swami Turiyananda (1863-1922) * Narendranath - Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) * Rakhal - Swami Brahmananda (1863-1922) * Sasibhusan - Swami Ramakrishnananda (1863-1911) * Gangadhar - Swami Akhandananda (1864-1937) * Kaliprasad - Swami Abhedananda (1866-1939) * Saratchandra - Swami Saradananda (1865-1927) * Saradaprasanna - Swami Trigunatitananda (1865-1914) * Subodhachandra - Swami Subhodananda (1867-1932) * Hariprasanna - Swami Vijnanananda (1868-1938) * Latu - Swami Adbhutananda (died 1920) * Nityaniranjan - Swami Niranjanananda (died 1904) =Alambazar Math= From February 1892 to February 1898, the Ramakrishna Math was located at Alambazar, half a mile from Dakshineshwar Temple. The house which housed the Alambazar Math, as it is popularly known today, was visited by Sri Ramakrishna. =Nilambar Mukherjee Garden= For a short period, the math was temporarily moved to the Nilambar Mukherjee Garden, below the final settlement at Belur Math. Belur Math This monastery, known as Belur Math, serves as the Mother House for all the monks of Ramakrishna Order who live in the various branch centres of Ramakrishna Math and/or the related Ramakrishna Mission in different parts of India and the world. Motto and emblem Emblem of the Ramakrishna Order Any organisation, especially the one that bears the name of an epoch-making person, needs a motto to guide it and an emblem that constantly reminds and inspires. Realising this, Vivekananda placed before it the motto: ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§ú‡§ó‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§ö - Atmano Mokshartham jagaddhitaya cha ('For the liberation of the Self and service to the society'). He also designed a charming but distinctive emblem that effectively reflected this motto. It consists of an elegant swan against the backdrop of the rising sun, surrounded by wavy waters from which has arisen a beautiful lotus flower along with a couple of leaves. This whole picture is encircled by a hooded serpent. Whereas the motto adds a social dimension to the hitherto, purely personal, aspect of a self-centred sadhana, the emblem - which graphically describes a balanced combination or harmony of all the four yogas - enriches that sadhana by making it more comprehensive.Swami Harshananda, The Concise Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, Vol.3 p.21 Swami Vivekananda explained the imagery in the following terms: \\"The wavy waters in the picture are symbolic of Karma; the lotus, of Bhakti; and the rising-sun, of Jnana. The encircling serpent is indicative of Yoga and the awakened Kundalini Shakti, while the swan in the picture stands for Paramatman (Supreme Self). Therefore, the idea of the picture is that by the union of Karma, Jnana, Bhakti and Yoga, the vision of Paramatman is obtained.\\" Bifurcation  The basic philosophy of life put before the Ramakrishna Order by Vivekananda automatically led to a bifurcation of its activities into two important, but parallel, areas. The atmamoksha aspect resulted in the establishment of the Ramakrishna Math, an organisation catering predominantly to the spiritual needs of the monks of the order as also its votaries. The jagaddhita aspect on the other hand, gave rise to another, a sister organisation, concentrating solely on public service activities.Swami Harshananda, p.21  Characteristics  Unlike the old monastic traditions prevalent at the time, the Ramakrishna movement has certain unique features. They may be listed as follows: =Non-sectarianism= The Ramakrishna movement does not identify itself with any particular sect or group or even tradition. It embraces the whole gamut of religio-spiritual development of the entire Hindu culture over the last five thousand years or more. It also has room for other religions and faiths. Therefore, Ramakrishna Math allows people even outside the Hindu faith to embrace monastic life following the basic monastic disciplines as exemplified in the lives of Ramakrishna-Vivekananda. = Group life and work ethic = Since its cradle years, the Ramakrishna monks have chosen to live in a group. Though from time to time, the monks went into solitude or wandering alone, the sense of brotherhood among them was too strong to keep anyone away from the monastery for too long. Since Sri Ramakrishna himself insisted on Sadhu Sangha (holy company) it is but natural for his disciples to seek the company of the each other The greatest advantage of a Sangha (organisation of monks) is strengthening of one another's spiritual vibrations and the rounding off one's angularities.Swami Harshananda, Vol.3 p.23 The philosophy of service of this Sangha is serving the Jiva as Siva (God). Thus, what is usually a mere act of social service is elevated to a spiritual practice. \\"No work is secular\\" is a popular dictum in the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda circle. Moreover, its members practice the teachings of Karma Yoga of 'perfection in action', therefore, any work taken up has to be carried out with efficiency as a spiritual discipline. The fact that the Movement lays great stress on selfless service as a means of God-realization also attracts many people. The service it gives is open to all, irrespective of caste or creed or language.Lokeswarananda, Swami, The Ramakrishna Movement, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata, (1991) p.40-41 Ramakrishna monks also are not averse to modern technologies, but on the other hand, actively canvass the use of technologies for the progress and well-being of the society. =Attitude toward social reform= Swami Vivekananda urged for a 'root and branch reform' and not merely superficial progress or development. Real reformation starts with reforming and refining one's own character. Character building and personality development are some of the activities taken up by the Ramakrishna centres to bring real lasting changes in the society. Therefore, the Ramakrishna Order do not directly involve itself in any social reformation. =Attitude toward politics= Swami Vivekananda with an uncanny vision of the future forbade his organization strictly from taking part in any political movement or activity. Why? Because the monk is a world-citizen, nay, a man of God! (And, world- citizens do not dabble in politics, whereas Godmen have no politics at all.) Administration The Ramakrishna Math was registered as a Trust in 1901. The management of the Math is vested in a Board of Trustees who are only monks. The Math with its branches is a distinct legal entity. It has well-defined rules of procedure. It lays emphasis on religious practices and preaching of Dharma. The Math has its own separate funds and keeps detailed accounts which are annually audited by qualified chartered accountants. In consultation with the senior monks of the Order, the Trustees elect from among themselves a President, one to three Vice Presidents, a General Secretary and four Assistant Secretaries. The President, also called the 'Sanghaguru' is the supreme Head of the whole organisation and the sole authority to confer Samnyasa or administering the monastic vow. The Presidents, Vice Presidents (or the Head of a foreign centre) are also empowered to give initiation or Mantra Diksha to devotees aspiring for it.Swami Harshananda, p.24 The General Secretary is the administrative head of the organisation. However, his power is limited to implementing the decisions taken by the Trustees/Members of the Governing Body, though he has the freedom to act in matters of day-to-day administration. The Assistant Secretaries work under his guidance.Swami Harshananda, p.24-25 The individual centres of the Math are managed by the Adhyaksha and of the Mission, by the secretaries, duly appointed by the Trustees/Members of the Governing Body. These again, are expected to carry on their work with the assistance of the monastic members allotted to their centres as also volunteers and paid-workers.Swami Harshananda, p.25 As on 31 March 2014, there were 409 monastic members, 254 lay members, and 181 lay associates. Vedanta Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai Universal Temple in Mylapore, Chennai, India The fundamental truth as taught by all religions is that man has to transform his base human nature into the divine that is within him. In other words, he must reach the deeper strata of his being, wherein lies his unity with all mankind. And Vedanta can help us to contact and live that truth which unfolds our real nature ‚Äî the divinity lying hidden in man. Vedanta is not a particular religion but a philosophy which includes the basic truths of all religions. It teaches that man's real nature is divine; that it is the aim of man's life on earth to unfold and manifest the hidden Godhead within him; and that truth is universal. Thus Vedanta preaches a universal message, the message of harmony. In its insistence on personal experience of the truth of God, on the divinity of man, and the universality of truth it has kept the spirit of religion alive since the age of the Vedas (ancient scriptures). Even in our time there have been Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, and men like Gandhi. The modern apostle of Vedanta, Vivekananda, describes the ideal religion of tomorrow as follows: Further reading Harshananda, Swami, \\"A Concise Encyclopedia of Hinduism\\", Ramakrishna Math, Bangalore (2008).

Several neighborhoods, including much of Van Nuys, portions of Sherman Oaks, Magnolia Woods, and Victory Park, are zoned to this school. History Van Nuys High School opened in 1914, four years after Van Nuys was established.LAUSD School Profile For years the only high schools in the valley were Van Nuys, Owensmouth (now Canoga Park), San Fernando, and North Hollywood. The main buildings and auditorium were built in 1933, incorporating remnants of the 1915 building which had been destroyed in the Long Beach earthquake. The football and track stadium, originally built at the same time as the current high school, is named for Bob Waterfield, and the baseball field for Don Drysdale, the two most famous athletes to have played for VNHS. For the 1998‚Äì1999 Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), Van Nuys high had a 537 average on the verbal portion and a 568 on the mathematics portion, giving it the highest SAT scores in the LAUSD that year.Sauerwein, Kristina. \\"SAT Scores Find Valley School at Top : Exam: Van Nuys High posts highest average in LAUSD. Two other area schools also surpass national and state averages in math and verbal portions.\\" Los Angeles Times. September 1, 1999. Retrieved on March 23, 2014. The Los Angeles Unified School District ordered Van Nuys High School to convert to year-round scheduling in 2001, due to such reasons as overcrowding. Even though this relieved the overcrowding at the school, the magnet programs separated tracks, along with the residential students. The Performing Arts Magnet and the Medical Magnet were available only on the A-Track Schedule, while the Math and Science Magnet was available only on the C-Track Schedule. B-Trackers could not take the same classes as C-Trackers, while C-Trackers could take only certain A-Track classes. Teachers that had both A-Track and C-Track students were frustrated because the curriculum had to be synchronized with both tracks. Van Nuys High School returned to the traditional school calendar in 2005. The switch was caused by a decline in the school population and by a new district policy to eliminate year-round schools whenever possible. The opening of Panorama High School in October 2006,http://www.laschools.org/project- status/one-project?project_number=55A67308 relieved overcrowding at Van Nuys High School. Van Nuys High School had the highest AP passing rate in the LAUSD for two consecutive years. Van Nuys High School was indeed established in 1915, although the first graduating ceremony was held in 1914 for a small group of students who had previously attended different schools, legitimately making the class of 2014 The Centennials. The issue was discussed between high authority figures of the school, and they decided that even though the first graduating ceremony that took place for students who did attend Van Nuys High School was in the year 1915, the first graduating ceremony to take place in the school took place back in 1914. Extracurricular activities Van Nuys has a range of extracurricular teams. Its Science Olympiad team has consistently placed in the top 6 in regional competitions, from 2014 to 2019, even advancing to state competitions several times, such as in 2018. Its Science Bowl team won the national competition in 1995, and has placed highly in regional competitions in the years since. Van Nuys has a newly created history bowl team , and has placed in playoffs on its first year of competing. Community Adult School The Adult School is on the same campus as Van Nuys High School. It allows adults as well as high school students to take classes. Most Van Nuys High School students take courses in the Adult School for academic remediation. However, some take classes for Counselor-Identified High School Credit Deficiencies, while others take classes for personal necessities of flexible scheduling. The Adult School is considered a work-at-your-own-pace program. A student can finish an entire course in just 2‚Äì3 weeks, but can take longer depending on the work effort of the student. Athletics In baseball Van Nuys High qualified for postseason play. The following time the school's team qualified was in 1989, after a 9‚Äì7 victory over Birmingham High School at the Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Recreation Center.\\"High School Baseball : Van Nuys Makes It a Day for Firsts.\\" Los Angeles Times.

He is best known as an Industrial music artist of the 1990s, noted for mixing metal and techno with more traditional Industrial sounds. His extrovert onstage behaviour was unusual in the generally downbeat Industrial genre. His most influential project was Cubanate, founded 1992 with Graham Rayner, Phil Barry and Steve Etheridge. Cubanate made four albums. Their final release, Interference, came out in 1998. They reformed in 2010, and released a re-mastered greatest hits album, Brutalism, in 2017. Heal first surfaced supporting Gary Numan in 1987 with Westwon.

It entered into force on August 9, 1980, and was later amended on September 26, 1980. The treaty is administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). As of July 2019, 82 countries are party to the Budapest Treaty.WIPO web site, Contracting Parties > Budapest Treaty (Total Contracting Parties : 82). Consulted on 7 July 2019. The accession to the Treaty is open to States party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883. The African Regional Industrial Property Organization (ARIPO), the Eurasian Patent Organization (EAPO) and the European Patent Organisation (EPO) have filed a declaration of acceptance under Article 9(1)(a)WIPO web site, Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure, Article 9 Intergovernmental Industrial Property Organizations of the Treaty. The treaty allows \\"deposits of microorganisms at an international depositary authority to be recognized for the purposes of patent procedure\\".WIPO web site, Summary of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure (1977), retrieved on October 21, 2008 Usually, in order to meet the legal requirement of sufficiency of disclosure, patent applications and patents must disclose in their description the subject-matter of the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete to be carried out by the person skilled in the art (see also: reduction to practice). When an invention involves a microorganism, completely describing said invention in the description to enable third parties to carry it out is usually impossible. This is why, in the particular case of inventions involving microorganisms, a deposit of biological material must be made in a recognised institution. The Budapest Treaty ensures that an applicant, i.e. a person who applies for a patent, needs not to deposit the biological material in all countries where he/she wants to obtain a patent. The applicant needs only to deposit the biological material at one recognised institution, and this deposit will be recognised in all countries party to the Budapest Treaty. International depositary authority The deposits are made at an international depositary authority (IDA) in accordance with the rules of the Treaty on or before the filing date of the complete patent application. Article 7 of the Budapest treaty outlines the requirements for a facility to become an International Depositary Authority. As of July 23, 2018, there were 47 IDAs in approximately 25 countries worldwide. Depositable subject matter IDA's have accepted deposits for biological materials which do not fall within a literal interpretation of \\"microorganism\\". The Treaty does not define what is meant by \\"microorganism.\\" The range of materials able to be deposited under the Budapest Treaty includes: *cells, for example, bacteria, fungi, eukaryotic cell lines, plant spores; *genetic vectors (such as plasmids or bacteriophage vectors or viruses) containing a gene or DNA fragments; *organisms used for expression of a gene (making the protein from the DNA). There are many types of expression systems: bacterial; yeast; viral; plant or animal cell cultures; *yeast, algae, protozoa, eukaryotic cells, cell lines, hybridomas, viruses, plant tissue cells, spores, and hosts containing materials such as vectors, cell organelles, plasmids, DNA, RNA, genes and chromosomes; *purified nucleic acids; or *deposits of materials not readily classifiable as microorganisms, such as \\"naked\\" DNA, RNA, or plasmids See also List of parties to the Budapest Treaty * American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) * Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) * Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community (DSMZ) * National Collection of Yeast Cultures (NCYC) * World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC) * National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC) * National Collection of Industrial Food and Marine Bacteria (NCIMB)  References  External links Budapest Treaty in the WIPO Lex database ‚Äî official website of WIPO.

The Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (), or Western Bosnia, was a small unrecognised state that existed in the northwest of Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1993 and 1995. It consisted of the town of Velika Kladu≈°a, its capital, as well as a few nearby villages. It was proclaimed as a result of secessionist politics by former Bosnian President Fikret Abdiƒá against the central government of Alija Izetbegovic during the Bosnian War. For a short time in 1995, it was known as the Republic of Western Bosnia.  History  Fikret Abdic was the winner of the popular vote to head the government of Bosnia in 1990 but surrendered to Alija Izetbegoviƒá under an undisclosed agreement. In 1993, according to journalist Anthony Loyd, Abdiƒá decided to try to carve out a little state for himself and succeeded in recruiting enough followers to make his dreams a reality. Abdiƒá was able to hold power over his mini-state by using cult-like propaganda techniques over his followers and Serbian arms and military training. \\"Talking to his autonomist followers was much the same as speaking with cult converts anywhere in the world: a wooden dead-end dialogue hallmarked by the absence of individual rationale and logic.\\" The economy of Western Bosnia was largely reliant on the Agrokomerc company of Velika Kladu≈°a. The Autonomous Province cooperated with Serbia as well as Croatia against the Bosnian government in light of the Karaƒëorƒëevo agreement meant to redistribute Bosnia and Herzegovina between Croatia and Serbia. Abdiƒá's role in undermining the rival authority in Sarajevo was awarded by the governments of Croatia and FR Yugoslavia (Serbia). Agrokomerc was granted a custom-free trade zone in the Croatian port of Rijeka and free trade with Serbian-controlled territories. Trade between Western Bosnia and Croatia occurred during the Bosnian War. In 1994, Franjo Tuƒëman changed his policies towards Bosnia after diplomatic pressure from the United States and the UN Security Council. The Washington Agreement was signed in March 1994. The situation became very unfavourable to the future of Western Bosnia, as Fikret Abdiƒá could no longer count on financial or military help by one of his protectors. It was militarily defeated during Operation Tiger in June and August 1994, when the territory of Western Bosnia was seized by the Bosnian government troops. However, they were expelled later that year with the significant help of the Serbs in Operation Spider, and the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia was re-established. The province declared itself the independent Republic of Western Bosnia () on 26 July 1995.) In August 1995, Operation Storm made it serve as the last line of defense of the Republic of Serbian Krajina in Croatia. The Republic of Western Bosnia was wiped out completely during the joint Croatian-Bosnian government army action on 7 August 1995.  Aftermath  Western Bosnia's territory was incorporated into the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, within the present-day Una-Sana Canton. Abdiƒá, who maintained friendly relations with Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman, had acquired Croatian citizenship and lived in Croatia in exile. After the death of Tuƒëman in December 1999 and the defeat of the Croatian Democratic Union in the Croatian elections of 2000, Abdiƒá was eventually arrested and convicted for war crimes against civilian Bosniaks loyal to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The trial took place in Croatia, where Abdiƒá was condemned to 20 years in prison in 2002. On 9 March 2012, he was released after he had served two thirds of his reduced sentence. In 2016, the citizens of Velika Kladusa elected Abdic mayor.

Personal Born Olga Palinka≈° in Zagreb to a Hungarian father and a Croatian mother, Kodar was the partner of Orson Welles during the final years of his life. They met in 1961 in Zagreb, PR Croatia, FPR Yugoslavia, when Welles was on location shooting The Trial, released the following year. Welles, at the time still married to his third wife Paola Mori, took a liking to the \\"dark, beautiful and exotic-looking\\" Palinka≈°.Thomson, David Razing Kane;Los Angeles magazine, April 1996The Trial Rotten Tomatoes Soon after their partnership took off, Welles gave her a stage name, Oja Kodar, which is a mixture of the nickname 'Oja', used by her sister Nina, and the Croatian expression \\"k'o dar\\" (as a present).Dr√∂ssler, Stefan, The Unknown Orson Welles, p. 39 The Italian press broke the news of Welles's affair with Kodar in March 1970, though Mori apparently remained unaware of it for several years. In his final years, Welles divided his time between a Las Vegas home he shared with Mori and a Hollywood house with Kodar. Mori died 10 months after Welles, and the estate was settled by Kodar and Beatrice Welles, Mori and Welles's daughter, on November 7, 1986.Case No. P20544, November 7, 1986; Clark County District Court, Nevada Cinematic career Most of Kodar's cinematic career revolved around Welles's projects, many of which were never completed. In 1966, five years after they met, the couple returned to the Yugoslav coast, where Welles began shooting The Deep based on Charles Williams's novel Dead Calm with Kodar playing one of the main roles. Welles envisioned the film as a commercial project, designed to do well at the box- office; however, the production ran into financial and technical difficulties and was not completed. Decades later, Kodar blamed it on an unwillingness by jealous co-star Jeanne Moreau to dub her lines, while editor Mauro Bonanni claimed Welles abandoned The Deep when he realized the novice Kodar was ill- suited for the lead role. Welles began shooting The Other Side of the Wind in 1970. Kodar says she co-wrote the screenplay with Welles, though it dates back to the early 1960s as a project Welles first conceived with Keith Baxter and Anthony Perkins in key roles. With a plot revolving around an aging film director's 70th birthday party, the film was conceptualized as a cynical portrait of 1970s Hollywoodparodying the end of the studio system, and the experimental new filmmakers of the New Hollywood, as well as mocking various European directors. The shooting, featuring Kodar as an actress referred to as ‚Äòthe Indian‚Äô or ‚ÄòPocahontas‚Äô, seemed to drag on for years and never got completed until 2018 (almost 50 years later). Unbeknownst to most people, financiers of the film were located in Iran; and the film was physically located in Paris. An imbroglio between the financiers and other parties kept Welles from ever fully possessing the film, thus Welles was never able to complete the extensive editing of the film during his lifetime. Kodar (uncredited) co-wrote and appeared as herself in Welles's free-form documentary F for Fake (1973), which initially received mixed reviews but grew in stature in the years since, owing to its groundbreaking editing techniques. In 1980, Kodar collaborated on a script for Welles's film The Dreamers based on Karen Blixen's stories. Test scenes with Kodar in the main role were shot in 1982, but Welles never obtained backing for the film. The Munich Filmmuseum has edited the black-and-white and color footage into a short film. Three months after Welles died in October 1985, Kodar sold her book rights to Dead Calm for $180,000 to Australian producer George Miller for a 1989 film of the same name; however, the deal nearly went sour until producers informed Kodar they would hold her liable for damages. Kodar made her debut as a feature film director with the release of Jaded (1989). The film was produced by Kodar and Gary Graver (one of the cameramen on F for Fake), who doubled as the director of photography. The film starred Randall Brady, Elizabeth Brooks, Scott Kaske, Jillian Kesner, Kelli Maroney, and Kodar. Portions of the film were shot in an artist's loft in downtown Los Angeles.\\"Jaded\\" on IMDb.com: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239070 Kodar supervised Jess Franco's assemblage of unedited footage of Welles's Don Quixote, which was released in 1992 to generally poor reviews.Don Quijote de Orson Welles , Variety, 19 May 1992 Kodar's second feature film as a director was the war drama Vrijeme za... (1993), whose plot is set during the 1991‚Äì95 war in Croatia. The film was co- produced by the state-owned Croatian production house Jadran Film and the Italian state television channel Rai Tre, along with the Italian production house Ellepi Films.Vrijeme Za...;Variety, February 13, 1994 She later co- directed and co-wrote the German-French documentary Orson Welles: The One-Man Band (1995). For this film, she supervised a compilation of unused footage shot by Welles over the final 20 years of his career. Kodar is interviewed in Los Angeles and in Orvilliers, France, where they shared a house. This documentary is included on The Criterion Collection DVD release of F For Fake. The documentary goes into details about the three unfinished films on which Kodar and Welles worked together. The Other Side of the Wind was largely completed, and according to media reports in April 2007 was planned for release in 2008.Howard Swains \\"Deal Near on a Lost Welles\\", The New York Sun, April 2, 2007 The other films were never completed for reasons explained in the documentary. In April 2015, Josh Karp's book Orson Welles's Last Movie: The Making of The Other Side of the Wind painted an unflattering portrait of Kodar as numerous individuals (investors, attorneys, executives and others) who have been involved with the unfinished film (it was finally completed and released in 2018) since 1999 all told a variation on the same tale in which Kodar derailed attempts to complete the film by reneging on agreements, pitting investors against each other, secretly shopping for better deals, and shifting her allegiances at critical junctures. Kodar's actions prompted an attorney for the Boushehri family, a co-owner of the film, to write in a 2007 memo: \\"We have been waiting for many years for her to agree to a deal... My own personal feeling is that she is incapable of making a deal with anyone... Our client has never been the problem. Kodar has been.\\" Directors Peter Bogdanovich and Henry Jaglom and author Joseph McBrideall onscreen participants in The Other Side of the Windhave confirmed that Kodar had at various points derailed attempts to complete the movie. A plan to complete The Other Side of the Wind by producers Filip Jan Rymsza and Frank Marshall was agreed to by Kodar in October 2014 but later fell apart as Kodar and producers renegotiated conditions of the deal.

He was called \\"Fortunatus\\", as he was able to secure Delmenhorst for his branch of the Oldenburgs. Dietrich was the father of Christian I of Denmark, who would go on to start the current dynasty of the Danish throne. Lineage Dietrich of Oldenburg was the son of Christian V of Oldenburg, who became the Count circa 1398 and died in 1403. His mother was the Countess Agnes of Honstein. His grandfather, Conrad I of Oldenburg, who died circa 1368, left his lands divided between Dietrich's father and uncle, Conrad II. Dietrich‚Äôs father, Christian V, managed to gain the upper hand when Conrad II's son Maurice II died in 1420. After this, most of the Oldenburg family patrimony was under the rule of Dietrich‚Äôs branch. However, the house had several minor branches with estates and claims, as was usual in any medieval fief. Dietrich of Oldenburg was the grandson of Ingeborg of Itzehoe, a Holstein princess who had married Count Conrad I of Oldenburg. After the death of her only brother, Count Gerhard V of Holstein-Itzehoe-Pl√∂n in 1350, Ingeborg and her issue were the heirs of her grandmother Ingeborg of Sweden (d. ca. 1290, the first wife of Gerhard II of Holstein-Pl√∂n), the eldest daughter of King Valdemar of Sweden and Queen Sophia, who herself was the eldest daughter of King Eric IV of Denmark and his wife Jutta of Saxony who had no male descendants. Since there were no other living legitimate descendants of King Valdemar by this time, Dietrich was considered the heir general of Kings Valdemar I of Sweden and Eric IV of Denmark. Dietrich succeeded his father as head of the House of Oldenburg in 1403. Marriages and children During his childhood, Dietrich married a distant cousin, the Countess Adelheid of Oldenburg-Delmenhorst, daughter of Oldenburg Count Otto IV of Delmenhorst, for reasons of succession and uniting the hereditary fiefs. Countess Adelheid is presumed to have died in 1404. In 1423, Dietrich married again, to Helvig of Schauenburg (born between 1398‚Äì1400 and died in 1436), widow of Prince Balthasar of Mecklenburg and daughter of the murdered Duke Gerhard VI of Schleswig and Holstein and his wife Elisabeth of Brunswick and, thus, sister of the reigning Duke Adolf VIII. All his legitimate children were born by his second wife. His second marriage strengthened this interest in the Scandinavian monarchies since Helvig was a descendant of King Eric V of Denmark, King Haakon V of Norway and King Magnus I of Sweden. At this time, Scandinavia was ruled by the Kalmar Union, established by Queen Margarethe I of Denmark. In 1387, she had lost her heir Olav IV of Norway, who was succeeded as heir by Eric of Pomerania and his sister Catherine, who was married to a prince of the Palatinate and Bavaria. Dietrich of Oldenburg is said to have been a rival claimant to the crowns of Sweden and Denmark during the reign of Eric VII/Eric XIII, whose succession was through Christopher I of Denmark, the younger brother of the murdered Eric IV, and through Magnus I of Sweden, younger brother of the deposed King Valdemar. Count Theodoric had three surviving sons and one daughter: Christian (1426‚Äì1481); who succeeded him as Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, and later became King Christian I of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (following the deposition of Charles VII of Sweden), as well as Duke of Schleswig and Holstein. He would found the House of Oldenburg Dynasty in Denmark that still rules to this day. Maurice V of Delmenhorst (1428‚Äì1464); when his elder brother became king, he was given the County of Delmenhorst. Gerhard VI, Count of Oldenburg (1430‚Äì1500); two years after his eldest brother had become king, he was given the county of Oldenburg, and from his other brother's heirs, he also inherited Delmenhorst in about 1483. The third son got his name from usages of the mother's Holstein clan. Adelheid (1425‚Äì1475), first married Ernest III, the Count of Hohnstein (d. 1454) and then, in 1474, Gerhard VI, Count of Mansfeld (d. 1492). Male line of descendants Dietrich of Oldenburg is a direct ancestor of the Danish royal family having given birth to the first House of Oldenburg King of Denmark, Christian I. He is also a direct ancestor of the British Royal Family, the pretenders to the Kingdom of the Hellenes, the Norwegian royal family, and the last Russian czars of Romanov-Holstein-Gottorp.

Today, the locomotive is preserved at the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History in Kennesaw, Georgia, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Before the Civil War  Built in 1855 by Rogers, Ketchum & Grosvenor in Paterson, New Jersey, The General provided freight and passenger service between Atlanta, Georgia, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, before the Civil War on the Western and Atlantic Railroad of the State of Georgia and later, the Western and Atlantic Railroad Company.  Civil War  During the Civil War on April 12, 1862, The General was commandeered by Northerners led by James J. Andrews at Big Shanty (now Kennesaw, Georgia), and abandoned north of Ringgold, after being pursued by William Allen Fuller and the Texas. Low on water and wood, the General eventually lost steam pressure and speed, and slowed to a halt two miles north of Ringgold, where Andrews and his raiders abandoned the locomotive and tried to flee. In 1864, the Battle of Atlanta had forced the withdrawal of General John Bell Hood's forces from the city. Hood ordered the ordnance depot destroyed as he left Atlanta on September 1, 1864. To this end, the General was severely damaged by being run into boxcars of ammunition and the Missouri locomotive. This was done deliberately so as to render the engine unusable for the approaching Union forces. Post-war service It had been speculated by some that, after the General had been damaged, the invading Union army restored the engine and operated it. However, many historians believe that the engine was left untouched for the remainder of the war. The Union army had based its repair shops in Nashville, and there is no evidence to suggest the engine was moved there. The United States Military Railroad Service had many new or like-new engines, so they had no need to restore captured ones such as the General. The USMRR had often left the damaged equipment of a captured railroad undisturbed, and its records, having listed the General as \\"captured and returned,\\" further suggest such was the case of the General. After the war ended, the General was repaired and continued service on the Western and Atlantic. In the 1870s, the General was completely rebuilt, it had received a new pilot, boiler, and other components. Most notably, its three dome configuration was reduced to two domes, and its Radley-Hunter style balloon stack was replaced with a diamond stack, as the engine had been converted to burn coal. Indeed, the rebuilt engine had little resemblance to its original form. Before the Civil War, most railways in the south, including the W&A;, did not give their engines numbers. Rather, they were simply named, such as the General. When the railroad began numbering engines after the war, the General was the 39th engine to be acquired by the road, and was numbered accordingly. Locomotives came and went as years progressed, and by 1880, a renumbering was necessary. At this time, the General was given the number \\"3,\\" being the third oldest engine that the railroad had at the time. The engine continues to carry this number today. In the mid-1880s, the Atlanta and Florida Railroad began construction. During this time, the W&A; had a locomotive surplus after buying several more modern engines, so they leased the General to the A&F; from 1887 to 1888 to assist in construction. The locomotive was originally built to the southern states standard rail gauge of . After a change to the northern states gauge was mandated by June 1, 1886, The General was converted to be compatible with the U.S. Standard Gauge of . Retirement and exhibition The General was retired from service in 1891 and stored on a siding in Vinings, GA where it awaited its final fate. Early the next year, E. Warren Clark, a professional photographer, discovered the engine in Vinings, and approached John W. Thomas, president of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (which had won the lease on the Western and Atlantic Railroad of the State of Georgia in 1890), with the proposal of restoring the General for exhibition at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Thomas approved of the idea, and the General was soon taken to the NC&StL; Ry Shops at West Nashville to be restored. At this time, the engine was given a Radley-Hunter style balloon stack similar to the engine's original, and was reverted to a wood burner. The engine had been restored by 1892, a year before the exposition. During this time, the engine traveled to Chattanooga to attend a reunion of the Army of the Cumberland veterans. This trip made apparent the difficulties associated with wood burning, so the engine was returned to a coal burner by the end of the year. The engine was given a unique new stack at this time, one that, while designed for coal burning, was styled like the original so as to give the appearance of a wood burner. In 1901, the General was placed on display in the Chattanooga Union Depot. There, it remained on display for nearly fifty years, only being removed for short periods for exhibitions. In particular, the engine was taken to Baltimore in 1927 to participate in the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's \\"Fair of the Iron Horse\\", then in 1933 to Chicago's \\"Century of Progress\\" Exhibition, the 1939 New York World's Fair, and finally, the Chicago Railroad Fair in 1948. In 1957, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad had acquired the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis, including its lease of the Western and Atlantic, and began planning to restore the General to operation for the American Civil War Centennial. In 1959, the General was removed from the Chattanooga Union Depot and taken to the railroad's South Louisville Shops to be restored. As part of the restoration, the General was given modern air brakes, a modern coupler (only on the tender, the older style coupler on the engine's front pilot remained), and was converted to burn oil. Throughout the 1960s, the engine pulled Louisville and Nashville Combine Car Number 665 as it traveled to various places across the eastern US, including the 1964 New York World's Fair under its own power. Battle for custody General Monument near Ringgold, Georgia In the mid-1960s, the state of Georgia began to express interest in reclaiming the engine. Indeed, many proposals about the General had arisen since the 1930s, while it was still on display at Chattanooga, including plans to have the General be displayed in Underground Atlanta, Kennesaw Mountain, or at Stone Mountain Park, among others, some of which even included removing the Texas from the Cyclorama to be displayed with the engine. While much press coverage was given about these proposals, none of them had ever materialized. Even the city of Paterson, New Jersey, where the locomotive was built, expressed interest, since many engines had been built by Rogers and other firms in the city, but had none to display. Paterson eventually withdrew their proposal and sought other engines to display. The state of Georgia's interest in the General soon raised tensions with the city of Chattanooga, where the General was displayed. In 1967, the city of Kennesaw, where the engine had been stolen in 1862, requested to have the engine attend a fundraiser held by the Big Shanty Historical Society.http://www.atlantahistorycenter.com/sites/default/files/texas_report_final_edits_5-18-15.pdf The General was on its way there, when it was stopped by a group led by Chattanooga's mayor, Ralph H. Kelley. He believed the engine belonged to the city, and a lawsuit had been filed against the L&N; concerning custody of the engine. On January 4, 1969, Judge Frank W. Wilson, U.S. District Judge in Chattanooga ruled that the engine belonged to the L&N;, who could dispose of it as they desired. The city of Chattanooga appealed, and the case was referred to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth District. The latter upheld Wilson's ruling, and the city appealed once more, sending the case to the Supreme Court of the United States.\\"City of Chattanooga, Tennessee, Felix Miller, Jr., Donald W.

The city of Chattanooga's appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court, thus making Wilson's ruling final. The General was stored in Louisville during this time, only being publicly displayed over a weekend in November 1971, when it was displayed in the city's Union Station alongside the road's newer diesel engine no. 1776. Present day After the L&N; won the legal dispute concerning the engine's custody in 1970, they brought the engine to Atlanta via the former Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern Railway line from Knoxville through Etowah, to Marietta, bypassing Chattanooga. In February 1972, a ceremony was held in Atlanta where L&N; president Kendall formally presented the General to then state governor (and later President of the United States) Jimmy Carter. Afterwards, the engine was moved to Kennesaw where a museum site was prepared. On April 12, 1972, the Big Shanty Museum (later known as the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History) opened, and the General remained on display there since.

The village is located on high grounds, south of Valletta. It is administered by the Gudja Local Council. A number of schools, clubs, public gardens and recreations places are found around the village. The Malta International Airport is also located in Gudja. The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, evident from remains still in situ. Scarce Punic remains were found in an area known as Xlejli, within the village. Several remains of the Roman period are scattered in the whereabouts, notoriously the ƒ¶al Resqun Catacombs. The area was inhabited during the Arab and subsequent medieval periods, and the settling found today dates to the Order of St. John. The centre of the village further developed during the British period, after which a number of modern neighbourhoods were built. The village has a concentration of churches, some dating to the medieval period, and other secular historic buildings such as Palazzo Dorell. Prominent buildings are now scheduled as Grade 1 or 2. Some buildings and a number of niches and statues are listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Name and motto Gudja means a land located on a higher ground but not a hill, with approximately round peripheries. Gudja's coat of arms bears the motto \\"\\", which means 'mother of many children'. These children are Safi, Kirkop, ƒ¶al-Farruƒ°, Luqa, Mqabba, Bir≈ºebbuƒ°a and Tarxien, which at one time were all part of the parish church of Gudja. From Tarxien another three parishes emerged: Fgura, Santa Luƒãija and the Christ the King Parish of Paola. From the latter, another parish emerged: the Our Lady of Lourdes parish at Paola. History Gudja was inhabited since prehistory, as evidenced by Ta‚Äô Gƒßewra dolmen. Other pre-historic remains are found in Gudja, such as those at the entrance close to the Malta International Airport. as well as the Paleochristian catacombs known as which are more than 1,600 years old. They were originally excavated by Sir Temi Zammit in 1912, and have only been re- discovered in 2006 by officers of the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage close to the Malta International Airport. Palazzo Dorell, a prominent building in Gudja The oldest still inhabited houses in Gudja date to at least 1533. A house built by this date is located close to the main square. A Gothic inscription, with Sicilian influence and Greek letters, sheds history on this residence. Though the words in relief are largely unreadable, there are old photographs and documentation on the considerably unusual inscription. An unusual tower dating to 1780 was built on the spot of a possible Punic-Roman tower in an area known as Xlejli. A palace, known as Palazzo Dorell, was built nearby and its garden has enclosed the tower within its grounds. The palace served as the headquarters for British forces under General Graham during the French blockade of 1798‚Äì1800. Plaque on the William Baker Tower The Baroque parish church is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, and it is the only one in Malta with three bell towers. The most conspicuous of these is the non-symmetric Neoclassical William Baker Tower.A.P.G. Lib. Calcoli e Notizie Diverse 1862;L.N.M. 'L'Ordine' Giornale Politico-Religioso, venerdi 19 aprile 1861. The interior of the church is decorated with objets d'art. The titular painting is that of the Assumption of the Virgin, painted by Italian artist Pietro Gagliardi in 1887. The same painter was commissioned for the Our Lady of Mount Carmel painting in 1889. Another notable painting is The Death of Saint Joseph, by Italian artist Domenico Bruschi in 1894. The most important sculpture, found inside the church, is the titular statue of the Assumption of Our Lady, sculpted out of solid wood in 1807 by the Maltese Vincenzo Dimech. It is the oldest statue in the Maltese Islands featuring the Assumption of Our Lady. Chapel of Bir Miftuh Gudja is known for its 15th century Chapel of Bir Miftuƒß.

Pre-historic stones are found close to the site, now forming part of a rubble wall. The Chapel of the Madonna of Loreto was built in 1548 by Knight Imbert de Morine as thanksgiving for his safekeeping during a Turkish battle which took place in the area. It was probably built on the same grounds where an older chapel stood. The Chapel of St Catherine, found at Raymond Caruana street, is an Early Modern church on the site of an earlier chapel. Raymond Caruana Street was named for murder victim Raymond Caruana. His assassination took place at the Nationalist Party Club and was politically motivated. The Chapel of the Annunciation dates to 1754. According to the pastoral visit of Bishop Bartolomeo Rull, the chapel was built on the design of a Greek cross plan and with a dome. The facade is plain, with strategically placed architectural feats. Flanking either side of the facade, there are two flat, austere-looking Doric pilasters which are topped by a blank entablature. The main portal is surrounded with a stone moulding with emphasis on the two corners above the door. Above the door is a triangular pediment with an arch embedded within. Piercing the facade, there is a window executed in the Baroque style. This window and a square belfry on top were added by sculptor and mason Anglu Dalli on the design of Carlo Farrugia. At the corners of the facade are two statues representing St Anne and Sr Joachim, while on the belfry there is a figure of the archangel Gabriel. These are the work of Antonio Zammit. The architect Girolamo Cassar, who is known for designing many buildings in Valletta, was possibly born in Gudja.

However, the first-ever official participation in the Maltese League was recorded in the 1949‚Äì1950 season. The initial club colours were black and white, but were later replaced by red, which represents the emblem of the town. However, another change of colours was later adopted with the use of blue and white colours that represent the colours of the patron saint of Gudja. Government The local authority responsible for Gudja and its constituents is the Gudja Local Council, which is made up of five democratically elected councillors. The first Local Council elections in Gudja took place in 1994 after the Local Councils Act was approved in Parliament in 1993. Since then, a further seven elections took place ‚Äì in 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2019. For the first few years, Local Councils served for a mandate of three years, while for the 2009‚Äì2013 term, the mandate was increased to four years. The current Local Council is expected to serve till 2024, due to changes in the Act itself, which extended the term served to five years to coincide with the European Parliament elections, which also take place every five years.

Nicknamed Fat Freddie (he carried as much as on his frame), and known for his mastery of the knuckle curve, Fitzsimmons' 217 wins were the third most by a National League (NL) right-hander in the period from to , trailing only Burleigh Grimes and Paul Derringer. In he set an NL record, which stood until , with a single-season winning percentage of .889 (16‚Äì2). He was an agile fielder in spite of his heavy build, holding the major league record for career double plays (79) from to , and tying another record by leading the league in putouts four times; he ranked eighth in NL history in putouts (237) and ninth in fielding percentage (.977) when his career ended. Playing career Born in Mishawaka, Indiana, Fitzsimmons broke in with the Giants in August 1925, posting a 6‚Äì3 record over the rest of the year. After seasons of 14 and 17 wins, he earned a career-high 20 victories in 1928, a year which saw the arrival of teammate Carl Hubbell; until Fitzsimmons' departure in , the two formed a formidable left-right combination at the heart of the Giants' staff. In he led the NL in winning percentage for the first time with a 19‚Äì7 record (.731), and an 18‚Äì11 season followed in . In , the first full season after Bill Terry took over from John McGraw as manager, he won 16 games with a 2.90 earned run average as the Giants won the NL pennant; in the 1933 World Series against the Washington Senators, he suffered a 4‚Äì0 defeat in Game 3, though it was New York's only loss as they captured their first title since . Fitzsimmons had another 18-win season in , and led the NL in putouts for the fourth time, tying Grover Cleveland Alexander's major league mark. However, his career then began to plateau. He had years of 4‚Äì8 and 10‚Äì7 in and , with the Giants winning the NL pennant again the latter year; he led the NL in shutouts in , blanking opponents in all 4 of his victories. His troubles returned in the 1936 World Series against the New York Yankees; he lost Game 3 by a 2‚Äì1 score, and was bombarded in the final Game 6 loss, leaving in the fourth inning while trailing 5‚Äì2. After a 6‚Äì10 start in , he was traded to the Dodgers in June for reliever Tom Baker, who made only 15 appearances for the Giants. Brooklyn shortstop Leo Durocher praised his new teammate's competitiveness, saying, \\"I wish we had nine guys like Fitz. We'd never lose.\\" Though his record in ‚Äì totaled only 18‚Äì17, in he tied Grimes' mark of 74 career double plays, passing him the following year; Warren Spahn broke his record in .

Hughes ( Boston Braves) and Emil Yde ( Pittsburgh Pirates), and stood until Roy Face posted an 18‚Äì1 mark (.947) with the Pirates. Fitzsimmons made only 12 starts in , going 6‚Äì1 as the Dodgers won their first pennant since . He almost earned his long-elusive World Series victory against the Yankees, holding them to four hits through seven innings in Game 3. But he was forced to leave with a 0‚Äì0 score after being struck in the kneecap by a line drive hit by Marius Russo, which caromed into Pee Wee Reese's glove to end the inning. His replacement surrendered two runs in the eighth, and New York triumphed 2‚Äì1. Manager and coach Following his knee injury, Fitzsimmons made only one start in and served as a coach on player-manager Durocher's staff. He then returned to the active list and made nine appearances for the Dodgers before Brooklyn released him July 27. The following day, the tail-ending Philadelphia Phillies tabbed him as their manager, replacing Bucky Harris and ending Fitzsimmons' playing career. He compiled a 217‚Äì146 (.598) record with an ERA of 3.51 and 870 strikeouts in 513 games and 3,223 innings pitched. Fitzsimmons was a better than average hitting pitcher in his career.

The people The townspeople are traditionally known as Tas-Sikkina (literally meaning 'of the knife' or 'those who carry a knife') or as Ta' Werwer (which literally means 'those who scare' or more colloquially, 'the scary ones'). This appellation could stem from the fact that a considerable number of used to work as stevedores on the docks and thus carried a knife at all times. Another theory was that the community of Sicilians who settled here illegally in the 16th century danced a traditional dance which involved the wielding of small stilettos which they carried in their socks, waving them in the air and back to their sheaths. =Notable residents= San ƒ†orƒ° Preca (founder of the Society of Christian Doctrine) although born in Valletta, lived most of his life in Hamrun. He is buried in a Chapel in Hamrun. It is the home town of former Prime Minister Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici and of Presidents Anton Buttigieg and Guido de Marco. The founder of the Malta Workers' Union (UHM), Salvino Spiteri, was born and lived here. Hamrun gave birth to several important artists and men of letters. Notable persons from Hamrun are the actor and lyrical singer Oreste Kirkop, who is remembered mostly for his role in The Vagabond King, and Maltese poet and theatre director Mario Azzopardi (born in 1944), who has a strong reputation for introducing new, radical poetry in Malta in the Sixties and who became the artistic director of the Malta Drama Centre (est. 1979).

The Airport scene in \\"Midnight Express\\" is well remembered. He was also Mayor of Hamrun. Another modern poet, Victor Fenech (b. 1936), involved for many years as a drama critic, also hails from Hamrun. From the romantic school of literature one should mention Rev. Frans Camilleri, also born in this town. Hamrun also gave birth to film director Mario Philip Azzopardi (born in 1950), who is not to be confused with Mario Azzopardi the poet and drama animator (also born in Hamrun in 1944). Mario Philip settled in Canada and has many commercial film titles and TV serials to his credit. The other Mario Azzopardi is a well-known poet and animator, accredited with introducing new forms of literature to the island. Joseph Buttigieg, distinguished literary scholar at the University of Notre Dame and father of South Bend, Indiana mayor and United States presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, was born in Hamrun. Hamrun is also the home town of playwright Oreste Calleja (b. 1946), an acclaimed author who wrote important new-genre plays in the native language. Hamrun has also been the home for a number of years of Bjorn Formosa M.Q.R, the ALS Malta founder, who in 2017 was also honoured with . Due to the prominence of the St. Cajetan Parish Church, many residents carry the name of the patron saint, generally in Maltese or in Italian. Culture Hamrun is increasingly becoming a cultural melting pot, especially in culinary terms. It organises an annual chocolate festival where chocolatiers from all Malta demonstrate their artistry. Cuisines available in Hamrun, apart from the contemporary local one, such as an art-deco caf√©, include Turkish, Afghan, West African, Syrian and Italian cuisine. =Churches= Our Lady of Atoƒãja Chapel is the oldest chapel in Hamrun. Our Lady of Atoƒãja It was built in the early 17th century by a merchant trader who brought the painting of the Madonna from Atocha in Spain. The people from Hamrun refer to it as . During the French blockade of 1798‚Äì1800, Maltese insurgents built a battery near the chapel. Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church is the Motherhouse of the Society of Christian Doctrine founded by Saint George Preca. In fact, he was buried in the crypt of the Church. On a Wednesday, in Passiontide, a Procession of Christ the Redeemer walks through \\"Strada Rjali\\" (Hamrun Main Road). The Procession starts adjacent to Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church and ends when the Statue of Jesus Christ is inside Saint Cajetan Sanctuary. The procession is accompanied by band funeral marches and the 1st Hamrun Scout Group. The Chapel of Porto Salvo was built in 1736 and it was conceived as a village chapel. It is built in the Baroque Style. Today the chapel is used mostly for the adoration of the Holy Eucharist. The local refer to the chapel as Ta' Santu Nuzzo. Immaculate Conception Parish Church was built in the 1960s to cater for the large population of Hamrun. In architectural terms the church has a very plain and neat design. In 1973 it became the first parish to receive the Neocatechumenal Way, from where it spread to another 26 parishes in the Maltese Islands. The Neocatechumenal Way is also present in St. Cajetan Parish. Together these two parishes have 13 'communities' with around 450 members. St. Francis of Assisi Church was built in the 1950s by the Franciscan Community to cater for the local community.

Originally it was intended to name the church for St. Joseph however Bishop Gaetano Pace Forno wanted to name the church after his patron saint. The church is built in a Neo-Gothic style. Its interior was painted by Emvin Cremona. The statue of Saint Cajetan was done by Carlo Darmanin.

Saint Cajetan's feast is celebrated on the first Sunday after 7 August and the Immaculate Conception feast is celebrated in the first Sunday of July. St Cajetan's feast generates a lot of commerce in the Hamrun district. The Parish church was designed by George Schinas. Construction of the church was finished in 1875. The titular painting was done by Pietro Gagliardi in Rome. The statue of St Cajetan is the work of eminent Maltese sculptor Charles Darmanin and was completed in 1885. There are three band clubs in Hamrun; St Joseph's band club, St Cajetan's band club and the Immaculate Conception band club, the only band in the Immaculate Conception Parish. St Cajetan's, or as it is also known \\"tat-Tamal\\" and St Joseph's, or as it is also known \\"Tal-Miskina\\", hold marathon marches \\"Marƒã tal-brijju\\" on the day of the feast starting early in the morning and ending late in the afternoon. There is great rivalry between the two band clubs, which makes for one of the most exciting feasts in Malta. Both band club are over a century old; St Joseph's was the first band club, set up shortly after the formation of the parish in 1889, whereas St Cajetan's was formed in 1907. The two band clubs are associated with two different colours; red for St Cajetan's Band Club whilst blue for St Joseph's Band Club. Supporters of the band clubs surround their respective marching band decked out in clothes and head bands and carrying flags of the same colour as that of their club. Hand-held fire works, especially noisy ones, are set off along the parade route and supporters shower the bands and their supporters with streamers and confetti from balconies and roofs. At times, the confetti look like a heavy snow storm. Little children run around playing with the mounds of paper that are left behind the marching bands. In the evening, local band clubs play on a band stand adjacent to the parish church. Locals and visitors walk back and forth along the main street under colourful lights and banners. The streets are lined with statues of saints and angels. The procession leaves the church early in the evening and winds its way around the city. The fiesta ends with a spectacular run up the stairs of the Parish Church. Volunteers carrying the statue of the Patron Saint take a \\"ƒ°irja\\" (run) up the stairs under the watchful eyes of parishioners, visitors and tourists. This traditional ending of the boisterous local feast dates back to 1898. The run is usually accompanied by an equally spectacular and noisy fire works display and loud cheers and clapping from the crowds. For a brief period, there was the possibility of this tradition being abolished, after the statue almost fell onto the crowd. It was however confirmed by the Diocese of Malta curia, on 1 June 2014, that the tradition should remain. On 7 January 2018, the town celebrated a 500-year St. Cajetan anniversary. Besides the feast of St Cajetan, Hamrun celebrates the feast of the Immaculate Conception both on the first Sunday of July and on 8 December with great fervour and delight. The titular statue of the Immaculate Conception is held with great esteem due to the admiration it drew from the great pontiff Leo XIII who on seeing its magnificence bestowed on it the honour of serving as a tangible means for grace through the distribution of an indulgence to whoever expresses devotion towards it. The feast of the Immaculate Conception is quite different from that of St Cajetan. Rather than focusing on the external more energetic and lively side of the feast, it is a feast which is much more muted and the parish's only band club guarantees a total absence of rivalry.

However, it was only in 1913 that the Hamrun Group was recognized officially thanks to the diligence and dedication of the founder of the Group, Mr. Edgar Delia and Mr. A.E. Vicari, the first Scoutmaster. The group's motto is Forward Hamrun. One can find documents that when Mr. Delia, together with other Maltese scouts participated for the first Scout Rally in Windsor Great Park in 1911, where he was given a bugle from Camp Commandant Lt. Col. Minden Cole. This bugle was the inspiration for the formation of the bugle and fife band within this Group. During World War I, the Hamrun Group served the country by helping in doing air-raid demonstrations and doing coast-guard watching around the island. After the War, the Group grew so much that towards the end of the 1950s it was thought that bigger headquarters would be needed. So, the Group Scout Leader of those days, Mr Joe Borg, together with the other leaders of the Group and with the help of Mr. Ernest Micallef, started to look for an alternative place. It was only in 1968 that the Hamrun Group officially inaugurated the old train station as the new headquarters. In the same year, the Group was honoured by the Coat of Arms of Duke of Argyll. From that day onwards, with the permission and approval of The Scout Association of Malta, the Group was known as the 1st Hamrun Scout Group Duke of Argyll's Own. This was a big step forward for the Hamrun Group, especially for its band, that now was honoured to wear the Clan Campbell tartan. thumb =Sports= Hamrun is home to the ƒ¶amrun Spartans football club . Hamrun houses Victor Tesesco Stadium, a stadium used for premier league fixtures. Two other important teams include the Hamrun Liberty who play basketball, and Hamrun Kavallieri playing rugby. Transport St Joseph High Road Several historic transport services used to pass through Hamrun, including the Malta Railway, known in Maltese as . The former train station is now used as the headquarters for the Hamrun Scout group which is one of the oldest scout groups in the world. Another transport service which used to pass through the town was that of the Tram. St. Joseph High Road () is the main street of Hamrun and one of the most important commercial areas of Malta. Schools Hamrun has the largest concentration of schools in Malta. The oldest schools of Hamrun are the Government Primary Schools. These schools cater for students from the age of 3 to 11 years. The older primary school dates back to the mid-18th century. The doorways of the school are adorned by busts of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The other primary school was built in the early 1920s. Maria Regina Girls' Junior Lyceum is a large girl's Junior Lyceum built in the late 1950s. Dun Guzepp Zammit Brighella Boys' Junior Lyceum traces its origins in the 1590s. The coat of arms of the school still bears part of the coat of arms of the Bishop Garagallo who was Bishop of Malta. Originally the lyceum was found in Valletta. The current building was built in the early 1950s. Maria Assunta Girls' Secondary School is one of the largest schools in Malta. This school was built in the 1960s with the help of UNESCO. Adelaide Cini Girls' School was another girls school in Hamrun. It was closed down just a few years ago. Today the same building houses the temporary location for students who eventually will go to M.A. Vassalli Boys' Junior Lyceum. Maria Teresa Nuzzo Girls' School was a school which used to cater for the low ability female students aged between 11 and 16 years. This school was located in the same premises of the Primary School built in the 1920s. The student population was around 100. This school was closed down in 2005. Our Lady Immaculate Girls' School is a church school which cater for from the age of 4 to 16. This school is managed by Franciscan Sisters. In this school there are almost 700 children. St. Joseph's Girls School is a church school which caters for students from the age of 4 to 16.

It is found near the Malta International Airport, and has been inhabited since pre-history. The parish church is dedicated to Saint Leonard. The football team of the village is the Kirkop United Football Club. Etymology and population The Annunciation Church The original name of the village was Casal Prokopju, and is retrieved from the registers of the Maltese militia that existed prior to the rule of the Order of St. John. Through generations, the local population corrupted the original name and was changed to Kirkop. The name of the village is claimed to be from a family name, or nickname, but this has been refuted by scholars. It is believed that the name has Sicilian origins. History Punic remains of catacombs are found around the village of Kirkop with some of them remain unexplored, and their exploration has been shelved. In 1969 Anthropologist Jeremy Boissevain published a research on the social fabric of the village in his book Hal Farrug: a village in Malta. Boissevain claims that the people of ƒ¶al Kirkop have lived in the area for centuries because of his assumed comparable bloodline with ancient Phoenician. The Phoenicians occupied the Maltese islands around 700 B.C.. Kirkop was part of a larger community, as part of the parish of Bir Miftuƒß, in the Middle Ages until the Early Modern period. However on 29 May 1592, it was declared a parish on its own right. The village had a population of 2,260 people in March 2011. By March 2014 this decreased slightly to 2,191 people. Places, buildings and structures In Kirkop, one finds the Menhir monolith, which has become the symbol of the village, and a number of Paleo-Christian Catacombs. Other notorious buildings and structures are listed monuments which include; the Church of the Annunciation, the Parish Church of St. Leonard, the Chapel St. Nicholas at the cemetery, a cross column (Is-Salib tad-Dejma), and a number of niches scattered around the village. There are two WWII shelters below street level. There are two band clubs, the St. Leonard Band Club and the St. Joseph Band Club, which are used as recreation.

The name Marsa means \\"the harbour\\".Town At A Crossroad. Marsa Local Council. Retrieved 11 July 2014. History Marsa is located on the Marsa Creek, a body of water formed by the flow of water from wadis in high ground near the sea. The creek includes the Grand Harbour which the town is based on. A port was first established at Marsa by the Phoenicians. Remains of Roman constructions have been found close to the town. At the arrival of the Order of St John in Malta, a particular cultivated garden was among the few places observed. A vital spring for the Grand Harbour was located on site. It is thought a foundry of the Order may have been located at Marsa. During the Great Siege of Malta of 1565, Marsa was used as a camp by troops of the Ottoman Empire. Following their defeat, Marsa became a barony containing a number of vineyards. A noteworthy bridge was located in Marsa which facilitated the road from Birgu to the area of Valletta and vice versa. Marsa in 1967 In the 17th century a historical museum, the Museo di San Giacomo, was located at Marsa. This was created when Giovanni Francesco Abela converted his house into a museum and was the first of its type on Malta. Many of its artefacts are now held at the National Museum of Archaeology in Malta's capital city Valletta. During the French blockade of 1798-1800, Maltese insurgents built Marsa Battery and Jesuit Hill Battery in Marsa to encircle the French in the Grand Harbour. Both batteries were demolished after the end of the blockade. A new port was constructed in the 1860s under the rule of the British Empire. It was intended that a town would be built at the site under the name Albert Town, named after Prince Albert. By 1890 the town had a population of over 600 people, but it was later abandoned. A new town at the site emerged in the 20th century, taking the name Marsa after the creek. In July 2009 a plan to regenerate the harbour area was announced. This is intended to turn the site into a recreational area and is planned include the construction of a marina with space for 170 boats. Facilities Marsa Power Station in 2009 Marsa is home to the Malta Shipyards. In November 2014, the Malta Shipbuilding in Marsa was also the venue for both the 12th annual Junior Eurovision Song Contest and the Malta Eurovision Song Contest 2015. Since 1953, the oil-fueled Marsa Power Station provided most of the electricity to the Maltese Islands, until it began to be demolished in 2014. A new Marsa north distribution centre will be built instead of the former power station, in order to reinforce the island's power grid. Marsa Race Track, a one- kilometre long horse racing track, was constructed in 1868 and remains in use. Malta's postal administration MaltaPost has its head office in Qormi Road, Marsa. The General Post Office, Central Mail Room and Philatelic Bureau have been located in this complex since 1997.

The Naxxar Church is dedicated to Our Lady of Victories. The annual village feast is celebrated on 8 September. Naxxar was formerly known for hosting the Maltese International Trade Fair at Maltese International Trade Fair Grounds. The Naxxar Locality is spread over an area of and has a population of over eleven thousand persons. The whole locality comprises the Naxxar centre, Sgƒßajtar area, Santa Marija tax-Xagƒßra, San Pawl tat-Tarƒ°a, Birguma, Magƒßtab, Salina, Baƒßar iƒã-ƒäagƒßaq and part of Madliena. Etymology Armoury (il-Palazz tal-Armerija) building in Naxxar, now a football club, home of Naxxar Lions F.C.. According to legend and the Bible, the people of Naxxar were amongst the first to help the shipwrecked, including Saint Paul, when the ship he was on went aground on the rocks. For this reason many connect the name Naxxar with Nassar (Nasra) which means 'conversion to Christianity'. The name might alternatively be derived from the Maltese verb \\"Naxar\\", which means to hang up clothes. Others insist that the name comes from \\"Nsara\\" or \\"Nazaroei\\" which means 'those who believe in the teachings of Christ who came from Nazareth and thus \\"Nozri\\"'. Others say that the word Naxxar means 'one who saws, separates or cuts' ‚Äì it might be worth mentioning that in Naxxar there are a lot of stonemasons. Magri, in his book says that the word naxar comes from \\"nazar\\" which in Hebrew means \\"chosen for him\\" or else \\"one who keeps to himself\\". This is because in the vicinity the Arabs had formed a village that they called Hal Muselmiet, which means 'the village of the Muslims'. For this reason the Christians started another village ‚Äì that of the Christians and so the name of Naxxar.\\"Naxxar, four walks to discover a village\\", Din l-Art Helwa, p. 31-2. Although it has never been clearly explained where the name Naxxar originated, it is a clear fact that there is a close tie with the tradition that the people of Naxxar were the first converts to Christianity. In fact the Parish of Naxxar was the first in the Maltese outskirts, after that of the Cathedral (Mdina) and that of Vittoriosa. This is borne out and further evidenced by the village motto ‚Äì Prior Credidi ‚Äì meaning the First To Believe. History It is not clear when Naxxar started to become a village, but human habitation in the area dates to the prehistoric era. This is evidenced by megalithic remains at Tal-Qadi and at Qaliet Marku. The cart ruts which start at Salina up to it-Targa and near Ghadira tal-Wej were probably first cut in the same period. * Boissevain, Jeremy (May 2014). Inversione residenziale: mutamenti nell‚Äôuso dello spazio sociale a Malta. Dialoghi Mediterranei. Istituto Euro-Arabico. (Italian) * In 1565 the Naxxar area was also the scene of a running battle between retreating Turkish forces falling back on their fleet moored in St Pauls Bay and Christian forces from Mdina and the Viceroy of Sicily; effectively the last stages of the Great Siege of Malta where the Knights Hospitaller managed to resist the forces of Suleiman the Magnificent. The parish church The parish church The Naxxar parish church was one of the ten parishes found to be existing by Bishop De Mello in 1436 and the villages of Mosta and Gƒßargƒßur were subject to it. De Mello listed it as one of the ten parishes of Malta and it was the first parish dedicated to Our Lady after that of the old cathedral in Mdina. In 1575, the parish of Naxxar had under its control a total of 36 churches ‚Äì 14 in Naxxar, 5 in Gƒßargƒßur, 12 in Mosta and 5 in the neighbourhood of these villages. The present church was built between 1616 and 1630 when there were 1200 inhabitants in Naxxar and it was felt that a larger church was needed. The design was made by Tumas Dingli, one of the best architects of the time. The parish priest was Father Gakbu Pace. The choir and the area around it was redesigned in 1691 to the design of Lorenzo Gaf√†, the same architect who had designed the Mdina cathedral. The parish church was solemnly consecrated by Bishop Alpheran de Bussan on 11 December 1732. Ta' Cisju Farmhouse was built in 1730 and is the oldest rural building in Naxxar.\\"Naxxar, four walks to discover a village\\", Din l-Art Helwa, p. 31.Naxxar Local Council (2013), \\"Towards San Pawl tat-Targa\\", Walks to discover a Village. The church has two choirs, the renowned Jubilate Deo choir and its sister children's choir Pueri Cantores Jubilate Deo. The choirs are currently being handled by Christopher Muscat and Daniela Callus respectively. The church also has two transepts and a nave and is long. The width of the transept is and the nave . The large bell was made by the founder Toni Tanti in 1840 and cost ¬£225. The fa√ßade of the church has two clocks, one showing the actual time whilst the other is a painting and shows the time as a quarter to eleven (11.45). The main painting shows the Birth of Our Lady which is attributed to the school of Mattia Preti (1613-1699) whilst at the side there are two paintings by Stefano Erardi (1650-1733) which show the Flight to Egypt and the Adoration of the Magi. Other paintings which show the Madonna and Child, St Cajetan, St Aloysius Gonzaga, Our Saviour and Our Lady of Sorrows are the work of the Maltese painter Frangisku Zahra (1680-1765). In the sacristy hangs the antique painting showing Our Lady of the Rosary which was painted on wood by Gio Maria Abela in 1595. The main door, which is made of bronze, is dated 1913 and is the work of Pio Cellini. The door is made up of four main panels depicting the coat of arms of Our Lady, Patroness of Naxxar; the village coat of arms; the coat of arms of Pope Pius X and the coat of arms of the family Zammit who were the benefactors of this door. In 1952 this door was dismantled, and renovated and cleaned by the blacksmith Mastru Lucens Agius. The expenses involved were once more paid for by the same family Zammit. The statue of the Vitorja, which feast is celebrated on 8 September, was imported from Rome whilst the statues of the Good Friday Procession are the work of a Maltese craftsman. Naxxar was one of the first villages which had the statues of the Passion of Our Lord and in fact it is believed that the procession started being held just after 1750. On 9 November 1787, the body of the martyr St Vittorio was brought from the cemetery of St Calepodio of Rome and is found in the altar in the choir. Some of the sculptures and fa√ßades were made by Angelo Quatromanni Chapels In the larger Naxxar area, there are various country chapels. These include the chapel of the Immaculate Conception which was built in the 18th Century; St Lucy's chapel; the chapel of the Shipwreck of St. Paul situated at San Pawl tat-Tarƒ°a; Church of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist; the chapel of St James the Apostle; Santa Maria tax-Xagƒßra; the Assumption of the Virgin in Magƒßtab which was built in the 18th Century; the Annunciation of the Virgin at Salina which was built in the 16th Century; the church of St. Michael the Archangel in Salina; that of St John the Evangelist and that of St Mary of the Angels in Baƒßar ic-ƒäagƒßaq. Fortifications Saint Mark's Tower Reserve Post R15 The actual area where the village of Naxxar is built offers a natural shelter to its inhabitants. In fact, in early times the village was used to reconnoitre the movements of the enemy. Because this height has a plain which goes right down to the sea, we find that three forms of defence were built through the ages ‚Äì those along the sea such as towers, entrenchments, batteries, redoubts and beachposts - as a physical resistance to those attempting to land from the sea; inland defences like pillboxes ‚Äì to hinder the advance of the enemy if they were successful in landing; and the fortifications on high ground.Naxxar Towers.

The palace was used by the Jesuit Community as a University. After buying the property in 1898, Marquis Scicluna altered it into its present state and purchased more land at the back, converting it into a large garden, between 1898 and 1906. =Palazzo Nasciaro= Palazzo Nasciaro is an 18th-century palace built during the Order of St. John that saw different adaptive reuse throughout the years. It is a prime example of late baroque architecture in the town of Naxxar.

To the east is Paceville, the nightlife district of Malta. The coastal town and tourist hub of St. Julian's lies to the southeast, and the residential area of Swieqi lies to the south. The hilltop village of Madliena is to its west, and Baƒßar iƒã-ƒäagƒßaq lies to the northwest. Pembroke covers an area of . The area hugs a coastal zone with a rocky beach. The highest point lies at 64 meters (210 feet) above sea level (at Suffolk Road, exit to St. Andrews Rd). The whole area was formerly a British military base from the 1850s to 1979. Pembroke is named after Robert Henry Herbert, the 12th Earl of Pembroke, and was authorised by Sidney Herbert, younger half-brother of Robert and Secretary at War in 1859. The town of Pembroke was formerly part of St. Julian's. Pembroke officially became a town by virtue of the Local Councils Act (1993). This Act recognised Pembroke as one of 67 localities in Malta, each having its own Local Council. Population The town's population stood at 3,645 in March 2014. By comparison, the town's population stood at 2,630 thirteen years earlier in 2001 which included 2,555 Maltese nationals. As at 2013, Pembroke ranked as the 38th most populated town from the 68 official localities in Malta. The population profile is quite young compared to the national average. As a matter of fact, only 91 persons were over 70 years from a population of 3,488 in 2011. This represents 2% of the town's population compared to the national average of 10% for this age category. The average age of the Pembroke population is 33.5 years compared to the national average of 40.5 years. The town's population has grown as follows;(NSO Demographic reviews) ::1985: Nil ::1995: 2,213 ::2001: 2,630 (inc. 2,555 Nationals) ::2005: 2,806 (inc. 2,697 Nationals) ::2010: 3,038 (inc. 2,925 Nationals) ::2011: 3,488 (inc. 3,346 Nationals) ::2013: 3,567 (inc. 3,407 Nationals) ::2014: 3,599 (inc. 3,428 Nationals) ::2020: 3,038 The five most common surnames in Pembroke are Vella, Borg, Zammit, Camilleri and Galea. These five surnames alone account for 15% of the town's population. History Madliena Tower The first known buildings in the area of the town date back to the time of the Order of Saint John. The Knights built two Watch Towers on the extreme ends of the current Pembroke coast. The first of these is Saint George's Tower, which was built in 1638 as part of a series of coastal watch towers financed by Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris. The second tower, Madliena Tower, forms part of a network of 13 coastal watch towers, collectively known as the De Redin towers, which were built between 1658 and 1659 during the reign of Grand Master Martin de Redin to protect the then uninhabited northern coast of Malta. These 13 towers adorn the official flag and emblem of Pembroke, reflecting the town's military heritage. However, it was the British who were instrumental in the development and fortification of Pembroke by building a military base complete with a hospital, cemetery, school, parade grounds, training grounds and shooting ranges. At this time, Pembroke formed part of Gƒßargƒßur. Initially, troops were billeted in tents and the area was known as the Pembroke Cantonment. The first barracks were constructed between 1859 and 1862 overlooking St. George's Bay and were named after England's patron saint, St. George. Later, other barracks were built and were named after the patron saints of Ireland and Scotland, St. Patrick and St. Andrew. Fort Pembroke was built between 1875 and 1878 to safeguard the seaward approach towards the Grand Harbour situated approximately 6 km to the East, as well as to defend the right flank of the Victoria Lines. Its main armament comprised three 11-inch R.M.L. guns and one 64pr R.M.L. gun on a Moncrieff Mounting. The fort is surrounded by a ditch and glacis and contains underground magazines and casemated quarters for the garrison. The site now houses the Verdala International School. Later, between 1897 and 1899, Pembroke Battery was built nearby to serve the same purposes but housing newer guns with a longer range, protected by reinforced concrete emplacements. Pembroke Battery was armed with two 9.2-inch breech-loading MK X guns. Only one gun emplacement survives today, located between Burma Road and Dun Luigi Rigord Street. The military heritage of Pembroke Army Garrison is still evident as several buildings from the British era survive to this day preserved as heritage structures. The Pembroke Military Cemetery marks the repose of 593 casualties, including 315 from the Second World War. The cemetery also houses the Pembroke Memorial which commemorates 52 servicemen of the Second World War whose graves are in other parts of Malta not falling under the care of the Commonwealth War Graves. Their names appear on marble plaques let into the plinth of the Cross of Sacrifice. The cemetery is open Monday to Friday. In 1915, during World War I, when Malta was an important hospital base for the British and Commonwealth troops in the Mediterranean area, the Army built what was then called St. Andrew's Church Room. In 1932, plans for an extension to the Church Room were drawn up and funds were raised from civilians and supplemented by generous contributions from soldiers of both battalions quartered in Pembroke barracks. The church was known as the Christ Church Garrison Church. The service of dedication took place on Sunday 12 November 1933. The extension permitted over two hundred people to be seated comfortably. The building today houses the Athleta Sports Club at Burma Road. Australia Hall in Pembroke In 1915, the Australian Branch of the British Red Cross Society collected funds for the building of Australia Hall, a recreation centre and theatre, to stand as a monument to the wounded ANZAC troops that were nursed in Malta. Unfortunately, the ceiling of trusses and sheeting was gutted by fire in December 1998 but its sturdy four walls still remain standing and are pending a restoration project. During the Second World War and the ensuing blitz on Malta, Pembroke did not escape unscathed and has borne the scars from its share of the bombardment. From June 1940 St George's Barracks was used to house the families of naval staff in the hope that it was far enough away from the RN Dockyards to avoid bombing. In the later stages of the war, German prisoners of war were held in Pembroke's POW camp. By 1945 they reached 2500 prisoners and several of them were of Roman Catholic denomination. They built a small chapel which served the religious needs of the catholic troops and prisoners. The Chapel was formally blessed by the Archbishop of Malta Mikiel Gonzi in May 1946. During 1947, several prisoners were repatriated to Germany and on 9 February 1948, the last contingent of 787 Germans were embarked from Malta heading home to Germany. On 17 February 1948, No.1 (Malta) Prisoner of War Camp was officially disbanded. In April 1960, the Italian Navy Rescue and Salvage ship Proteo came to Malta and collected the remains of 121 German and 79 Italian dead of the Second World War who had been buried in the Pembroke Military cemetery. The ship sailed for Sardinia where the coffins were re-interred in the St. Michele Communal Cemetery, situated just outside the main town of Cagliari. After the war, Pembroke hosted various regiments that formed the backbone of the Malta garrison and other regiments were posted here for training camps. Some of the Barracks also hosted the families of those soldiers on longer postings. The British military base at Pembroke was run down in 1977 and the last British soldiers left Pembroke in 1979. On 16 March 1977, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, Admiral of the Fleet, took the salute as 41 Commando Royal Marines trooped the Regimental Colour at the parade ground by St Andrew's Barracks. This ceremony marked the beginning of the withdrawal of British Forces from Malta. Since then, all the land which had been acquired by the British during their period in Malta has been relinquished to the Maltese Government. Recent times Pembroke Gardens, inaugurated in 2012 Pembroke remained neglected between 1979 and 1984. By the mid-1980s some of the former barracks were converted into housing projects. There was also a short-lived, large holiday complex which only lasted a few years (Medisle Village complex, including the Raffles discoth√®que and the Victoria Pub). On 4 July 1983, the Maltese Parliament approved a motion to commence issuing plots of land for sale/lease for the purpose of building residential houses. The first residents settled in 1986. In 1993, Pembroke was separated from St. Julians and formally became a new town. Pembroke has since developed into a pleasant residential town and a rather green town by Maltese standards. It is popular with visiting language students particularly during the summer months. The Archbishop of Malta declared Pembroke as a parish on 8 December 2004. Formerly, Pembroke fell within the parish of St. Julians and later as an autonomous zone under Ibrag. The parish is dedicated to the Resurrection of Christ. Unlike most towns and villages in Malta, Pembroke does not hold a village festa. The new church is built on the same site of the former small chapel erected in 1945 by German prisoners of war. The town is well known for hosting a high concentration of schools and educational institutions. The main schools are the following; St. Clare Primary and Secondary State Schools; St. Clare College Girls' Junior Lyceum (ex-Sir Adrian Dingli Junior Lyceum); St Patrick's Craft Centre; Verdala International School; Framingham State College; Sprachcaffe Languages Plus; St. Catherine's High School; Institute of Tourism Studies; St. Michael's Foundation; STC Training; San Miguel School and Middlesex University (Malta Campus). Pembroke Athleta Football Ground Pembroke is also associated with sports. The Pembroke Athleta Football Club represents the town in the national league. Other clubs established in Pembroke include Pembroke Athleta Sports Club; Luxol Sports Club; Melita F.C.; Pembroke Rackets Tennis Club; Assoƒãjazzjoni tal-BMX; Judo Federation; Spinach Fitness Club and the Malta Archery Club.  Geology  Pembroke's coastline, looking towards Baƒßar iƒã-ƒäagƒßaq and Magƒßtab Pembroke has the last large expanse of karstland left in Malta, covering over 60 hectares of garigue. Endangered plants are still found in the area, the most important of these is the thorny salad-burnet (). Aleppo pines () dominate the forested areas. The coastal zone is designated a Special Area of Conservation(SAC). The rocky coast, watercourse and karst land surrounding and including the Pembroke rifle ranges are scheduled locally as 'Areas of Ecological Importance' and 'Sites of Scientific Importance', whereas the rifle ranges themselves are protected as historic structures. This garigue zone hugs the coast and is interrupted by the 'Reverse Osmosis' water desalination plant, the largest plant in Malta. The plant was purposely placed on the Pembroke coast due to the cleanliness of the pristine sea water in the area, free from any effluent or any agricultural run-off . A geological feature unique in the Maltese archipelago is the large natural cavern at the ƒ¶arq ƒ¶ammiem valley which separates Pembroke from St. Julians. The large cavern tops a closed lake having a surface area of 300 square meters and is very deep. An underwater survey commissioned by the Maltese government in 2001 discovered the lake's depths were even deeper than previously assumed. The underwater formation consists of two large chambers interconnected by a corridor. The lower chamber is fully submerged. This unique feature is not well known as access to the cavern is blocked by a private enterprise and this irregular claim does not seem to be challenged by the authorities . The Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) has declared ƒ¶arq ƒ¶ammiem cave and the full extent of the remnant valley system as an Area of Ecological Importance and Site of Scientific Importance as per Government Notice No. 370/08 in the Government Gazette dated 23 April 2008.

Farmers choose good seeds, soak them in water, and sow them in moist soil (either in pots or in a garden). Ochna integerrima likes moist and light soil, cannot stand waterlogging. Therefore, it is necessary to grow Ochna integerrima in high places and water them regularly. If growing in pots, pay attention to fertilizing and change the soil every year. To have a beautiful flower pot, we should often pay attention to cutting branches, bending branches, creating a posture to have unique shaped Ochna integerrima pots.  The legend of Ochna integerrima  Vietnamese people have a fairy tale about Ochna integerrima. The story is about a kind and brave girl. She fought a monster to protect the villagers. Unfortunately, she died after the battle. Her bravery touched the Gods. So, although she died, every New Year comes, she is revived to visit her family and her village for 9 days. When her parents died, she transformed into a flowering tree. Every time the New Year comes, the flowers bloom brightly like the yellow shirt she usually wears. That is Ochna integerrima. Vietnamese people believe that, on Tet holiday, Ochna integerrima can banish ghosts throughout the year.

The Glastonbury chair was known to exist since the Early Middle Ages, but seems to have disappeared from use in part of the Later Middle Ages; it re-emerged in use in Italy by the fifteenth century AD. In England it was made originally from a description brought back from Rome in 1504 by Abbot Richard Beere to Glastonbury Abbey, and was produced for or by John Arthur Thorne, a monk who was the treasurer at the abbey. Arthur perished on Glastonbury Tor in 1539, hung, drawn and quartered alongside his master, Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury, during the dissolution of the monasteries. The Abbot sat on a Glastonbury chair during his trial at Bishop's Palace, Wells, where one of the two original surviving examples (illustrated) can still be seen, together with other chairs of this age and later reproductions. Another chair of the same style, believed at the time to be of the same date, was owned by Horace Walpole and kept in his Gothic pile Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, Middlesex. When the contents were sold in 1842, the then vicar of Glastonbury, the Reverend Lionel Lewis, made an impassioned speech telling the bidders the chair belonged in Glastonbury. Nobody bidding against him, Lewis took the chair to St John's Church in Glastonbury where it remains. However, this chair is now believed to be a later copy. A reproduction chair, also in the Bishop's Palace, Wells The Glastonbury chair design has become popular with reenactors, owing to its simple construction, wide availability of plans, and the opportunity for extensive decorative carving. As a result, there are likely more chairs of this pattern in existence now than there ever were in period. The chair does not fold. Although it is frequently assumed to do so, especially when made with circular tenons, triangular frames remain rigid even if they are joined by bearings. If the tenons are tusked then the chair may be quickly dismantled for shipping. Chairs for re-enactment are usually made in this way, but there is no evidence in period that they were regarded as being especially portable.

The missions of the light cavalry were primarily raiding, reconnaissance, screening, skirmishing, patrolling, and tactical communications. They were usually armed with swords, spears, or bows, and later on with pistols or carbines. Light cavalry was used infrequently by the Greeks and Romans (though Roman auxiliaries were often mounted), but were popular among the armies of Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Western Asia. The Arabs, Cossacks, Hungarians, Huns, Kalmycks, Mongols, Turks, Parthians, and Persians were all adept light cavalrymen and horse archers. With the decline of feudalism and knighthood in Europe, light cavalry became more prominent in the armies of the continent. Many were equipped with firearms, as their predecessors had been with bows. European examples of light cavalry included stradiots, hobelars, hussars, chasseurs √† cheval, cossacks, chevau-l√©gers, uhlans and some dragoons.  Historical use  Armies of the ancient Roman-Germanic wars made use of light cavalry as patrolling squads, or armed scouts, and often had them in the front lines during regional battles. During the Punic Wars, one of Carthage's main advantages over Roman armies was its extensive use of Numidian light cavalry. Partly because of this, the Roman general Scipio Africanus recruited his own cavalry from Sicily before his invasion of Tunisia during the Second Punic War. = Middle Ages = Mongol soldier on horseback, preparing a mounted archery shot Types of light cavalry that were developed and used in medieval armies. * Hobelar: Originally Irish, later popular in English and Scottish armies of the 14th and 15th centuries * Koursores: Byzantine light cavalry. The name derives from the Latin term cursarius meaning 'raider'. * Jinete: Spanish light horsemen, particularly popular during the Reconquista (Jinete is the person riding a horse) * Stradiot: Of Albanian and Greek origin, used as mercenary light cavalry in Italy in the later 15th century * Turcopole: A light mounted archer used extensively during the Crusades in the Middle East but also found among the Teutonic Knights in their Baltic campaigns * Horse archers: light or heavy cavalry primarily armed with bows. This allowed the Mongols to conquer large parts of Asia and Europe in the 13th century. Horse archers were also used extensively in steppe warfare throughout Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and the North American Great Plains. = Napoleonic era = French 4th Hussar at the Battle of Friedland, 14 June 1807. \\"Vive l'Empereur!\\" by √âdouard Detaille, 1891. Polish cavalry at the Battle of Somosierra in Spain, 1808 Light cavalry played a key role in mounted scouting, escorting and skirmishing during the Napoleonic era. Light horse also served a function in major set-piece battles. While lacking the sheer offensive power of heavy cavalry, light cavalry were still extremely effective against unprepared infantry and artillery. All infantry commanders were forced to respect the danger any cavalry presented to their forces, and light cavalry were effective at changing the movement of enemy forces simply through their presence. In the aftermath of battles, light cavalry were used to press a victor's advantage or to screen retreating forces from further attack. * Hussars: distinctively dressed light cavalry of Serbo-Hungarian origin. Locally recruited Hussar regiments were incorporated in most Napoleonic armies although by this period their functions and equipment were the same as other categories of light horse. * Uhlans: Originally Polish light cavalry armed with lances as their primary weapon, in addition to sabers and pistols. Locally recruited lancer regiments with this designation were later also used by the Russian, Prussian, and Austrian armies. The long reach of the lance made them an effective shock force against dispersed infantry. * Carabiniers: A mounted soldier armed primarily with a carbine. The carbine was considered a more appropriate firearm for cavalry use than a full-length musket or rifle, since it was lighter in weight, shorter in length, and easier to manipulate from horseback during combat. Carabiniers differed greatly between militaries, but were generally regarded as medium cavalry that used weapons and tactics that were complementary to mounted infantry. * Dragoons: Originally a type of mounted infantry armed with swords and muskets, dragoons had by the late eighteenth century evolved into heavy and light dragoon classes. The latter performed the usual functions of light cavalry, although they might on occasion still undertake dismounted action using carbines. * Lancers: A mounted soldier armed primarily with a lance and tasked with charging enemy infantry, cavalry, and artillery formations on the battlefield. They also served in the light cavalry roles of scouting, screening, and skirmishing. * Mamluks: A slave warrior, soldier, or mercenary that oringnated mostly from Turkic and Caucasian peoples that served between the 9th to 19th century in the Islamic world with a higher social caste than most free peoples or citizens. They fought mostly as light horsemen armed with a lance, saber, brace of pistols, carbine, or javelins.Painting of a Sowar from the 6th Madras Light Cavalry of British India in 1845 * Sowars: An Indian light horsemen usually armed with a lance, sword, or musket. Cavalry with this designation had comprised the bulk of Indian cavalry forces between the 16th to 19th century. Regiments of sowers designated as Light Cavalry were subsequently widely employed by the British East India Company. * Chasseurs √† cheval: the main element of the French light cavalry that performed the same functions as hussars. * Cossacks: Russian irregular light horsemen armed with a lance, sword, bow, or musket and recruited on a semi-feudal basis from frontier communities. Required to provide their own horses and equipment and meet long- term service obligations in return for land grants. They played a major role in harassing the French and allied armies during the Retreat from Moscow of 1812. =Early 20th century= As late as the early 1900s, most European armies still retained a nominal division of mounted troops according to the size and weight of the men, into light cavalry (raiding, reconnaissance, and screening), medium cavalry (offense or defense), and heavy cavalry (direct shock).pages 568‚Äì570, Volume 5, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica ‚Äì eleventh edition While colonial warfare had led to a blurring of these distinctions in the British army, tradition remained strong in the cavalry arm of some other nations. As an example, the Imperial German army maintained a marked difference between the sizes and weights of the men and horses allocated to the hussar regiments that made up its light cavalry and those of the other two categories.page 570, Volume 5, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica ‚Äì eleventh edition The early weeks of World War I saw light cavalry attempting to continue its long established function of being the \\"eyes and ears\\" of the respective main armies. However, despite some early success, the advent of trench warfare and aircraft observation quickly rendered this role obsolete, except to an extent in the Middle East in 1917, and in Eastern Europe where light cavalry mounted actions on a diminishing scale continued to occur until the revolution of 1917 took Russia out of the war. Late 20th Century and Modern Day During the Vietnam War, the US Army converted parts of the 1st Cavalry Division for heliborne tactics with a concept known as Air Cavalry. Helicopters were used to insert troops and support them. They were also used for suppression fire, search and rescue, medical evacuation, scouting and resupply. This concept was first tested at the Battle of Ia Drang Valley.https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/air-cavalry-in- vietnam.htmlhttps://www.historynet.com/air-cav-how-soldiers-in-the-sky- reshaped-combat-on-the-ground.htm Modern tactics call for the use of gunships to dominate the airspace and provide fire support while transport helicopters ferry ground forces and supply them. Light reconnaissance vehicles (LRV) are also being used by cavalry squadrons and infantry scout units for scouting, skirmishing and providing light fire support.https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2017/06/15/coming-soon- details-for-the-armys-light-reconnaissance-vehicle/ See also Horses in warfare * Waler horse References and notes External linksLight Cavalry in Napoleonic Wars * ","title":"Light cavalry"},{"id":"1857896","text":"Ugo Bassi (August 12, 1800 ‚Äì August 8, 1849) was a Roman Catholic priest and Italian nationalist. Bassi was born at Cento, Emilia-Romagna, and received his early education at University of Bologna. Bust of Ugo Bassi at the Janiculum in Rome Bassi and Livraghi led to their execution place. An unhappy love affair induced him to become a novice in the Barnabite order when eighteen years old. He returned to Rome, where he led a life of study and devotion, and entered into his ministry in 1833. It was as a preacher that he became famous, his sermons attracting large crowds owing to their eloquence and genuine enthusiasm. He lived chiefly in Bologna, but travelled all over Italy preaching and tending the poor. He was so poor himself that he often did not have food to eat. At the outbreak of the revolutionary movements in 1848, Pope Pius IX still appeared to be a Liberal and an Italian nationalist. As a result, Father Bassi, filled with enthusiasm, joined General Durando's papal force to protect the frontiers as an army chaplain. His eloquence drew fresh recruits to the ranks, and he exercised great influence over the soldiers and people. When the Supreme Pontiff renounced all connection with the nationalist movement, it was only Bassi who could restrain Bolognese Liberals in their indignation. At Treviso, where he had followed Guidotti's volunteers against the Austrians, he received three wounds, delighted to shed his blood for Italy (May 12, 1848). He was taken to Venice, and on his recovery he marched unarmed at the head of the volunteers in the fight at Mestre. After the Pope's flight from Rome and the proclamation of the Roman Republic, Bassi took part with Garibaldi's forces against the French troops sent to re-establish the temporal power. He risked his life many times while tending the wounded under fire, and when Garibaldi was forced to retreat from Rome with his volunteers his chaplain followed him in his march to San Marino. When the legion broke up, Garibaldi escaped. But Father Bassi and a fellow-Garibaldian, Count Livraghi, after a long manhunt were captured near Comacchio. On being brought before the papal governor, Bassi said: \\"I am guilty of no crime save that of being an Italian like yourself. I have risked my life for Italy, and your duty is to do good to those who have suffered for her.\\" The governor responded by handing the prisoners over to an Austrian officer. They were escorted to Bologna, convicted by a military tribunal with having been caught bearing arms. Both men were executed by firing squad on 8 August 1849. The execution of Father Bassi enraged Liberals all over Europe. References External links Ugo Bassi is spoken of in James Aitken Wylie's History of the Papacy in Chapter XI The Sacraments. Under note 9 for that chapter Wylie says - From a recent barbarity, we should infer that the modern Romanists place the seat of this impression in the finger points.

The Mysians avoided consuming any living thing, and therefore lived on such foodstuffs as milk and honey. For this reason, they were referred to as \\"god-fearing\\" and \\"capnobatae\\" (kapnobatai) or \\"smoke- treading\\". The Ctistae were a class of Mysians who not only observed these dietary restrictions, but abstained from cohabitating with women. They led celibate lives, never marrying. They were held in a place of honor by the Thracians, with their lives being dedicated to the gods. They are described by Strabo, sourcing Poseidonius. Strabo, ' VII.3.3: and there are some of the Thracians who live apart from woman-kind; these are called \\"Ctistae,\\" and because of the honour in which they are held, have been dedicated to the gods and live with freedom from every fear; According to Strabo, whether they took up celibacy or not they were collectively called Hippemolgi (\\"mare-milkers\\"), Galactophagi (\\"living on milk\\") or Abii (\\"not living (with women)\\").Strabo, ' VII.3.3: , men most just,\\" but he calls them \\"Abii\\" more especially for this reason, that they live apart from women, since he thinks that a life which is bereft of woman is only half-complete ; Comparative analysis Strabo, in the same section notes that the Greeks confounded the Mysians with the Getae (or Geto-Dacians).Strabo, ' VII.3.3 That the Ctistae described by Strabo might be equivalent to the Polistai among the Dacians mentioned by Josephus in the Antiquities of the Jews Book 18, Chapter 1 paragraph 5 has been noted early on by Scaliger (d. 1609).

Giacomo Durando (4 February 1807 ‚Äì 21 August 1894) was an Italian general and statesman. His brother Giovanni was also a general of the Risorgimento and a senator. Biography Durando was born at Mondov√¨, in Piedmont. He graduated in law in Turin in 1829. He was implicated in a liberal plot aiming to extort a constitution from king Charles Felix: after having been discovered, he was obliged to take refuge abroad together with his brother, first in Kentucky and then in France. In 1831 he fought in a foreign corps in the Belgian Revolution, and, the following year, he moved to Nashville where he was enrolled in a cavalry regiment of the constitutionalist army of King Pedro IV. The following year he entered the service of Spain, when he fought in various campaigns, and was promoted colonel in 1838. After a short stay in France he returned to Italy and identified himself with the Liberal movement; he became an active journalist, and founded a newspaper called L'Opinione in 1847. In 1848 he was one of those who asked King Charles Albert for the constitution. On the outbreak of the First Italian Independence War against Austria he took command of the Lombard volunteers as major- general, and in the campaign of 1849 he was aide-de-camp to the king. He was elected member of the first Piedmontese parliament and was a strenuous supporter of Cavour; during the Sardinian expedition to Crimean he took General La Marmora's place as war minister. In 1855 he was nominated senator, lieutenant-general in 1856 and ambassador at Constantinople in 1856, and minister for foreign affairs in the Rattazzi cabinet two years later. During the Third Italian War of Independence his brother Giovanni commanded the I Corps, which was badly mauled at Custoza. He was president of the Italian Senate from 1884 to 1887, after which year he retired from the army. He died at Rome in August 1894.

Spanning the entire line of books, it served to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Marvel's X-Men. When Magneto and his Acolytes return, a new confrontation with the X-Men begins, with Professor Xavier tempted to cross a moral line to stop them. Plot summary The Acolytes, now led by Fabian Cortez, attack Camp Hayden, the headquarters for Project: Wideawake, the latest government Sentinel program. The base is defended by government-sponsored mutant team X-Factor, and as the battle rages Cortez makes an offer to Quicksilver to be the Acolyte's new leader, accepting his role as Magneto's heir. The Acolytes leave after Quicksilver strongly declines. X-Force is approached by the mutant Exodus, who brings an offer of sanctuary from an unknown greater power. It is revealed that the \\"sanctuary\\" (which is referred to as Avalon) is in fact Cable's former base of operations Graymalkin (now retrofitted with Shiar technology), and the \\"greater power\\" to be the mutant Magneto, who was presumed dead after the fall of Asteroid M. Cable teleports X-Force away from Avalon using the station's bodyslide technology, while he retrieves the sentient computer program Professor from the central core and activate the auto-destruct function. However, he is only successful in the former objective, as Magneto prevents him from fulfilling the latter, and Cable very nearly loses his life in a lopsided battle before teleporting himself out. The mutants Rusty and Skids, who were cured of their brainwashing at Stryfe's hands by Magneto, elect to stay aboard Avalon. While the X-Men are burying Illyana Rasputin (who was killed by the Legacy Virus), Magneto and the Acolytes crash the funeral, stating their intentions to wipe out humanity from Avalon, their space station. Colossus, distraught over his sister's death and faltering in his faith in Professor X and his dream, joins Magneto and the Acolytes. The UN Security Council activates the Magneto Protocols, which uses a network of satellites to create a barrier around the planet that will prevent Magneto from using his powers from within. Magneto retaliates by unleashing an electromagnetic pulse on the Earth that creates havoc on the world's electrical systems. Professor X dons a Shi'ar exoskeleton that enables him to walk, and assembles Jean Grey, Gambit, Rogue, Quicksilver and Wolverine to go to Avalon and stop Magneto. Arriving via Shi'ar teleportation device, the team boards Avalon and disables the station with a virus created by Beast. Magneto engages the X-Men in battle, and in a fit of rage after nearly being gutted by Wolverine, tears the adamantium out of Wolverine's skeleton. Professor X, enraged by Magneto's actions, mindwipes Magneto, leaving him in a coma. The X-Men race back to Earth to treat Wolverine, while Colossus stays in a devastated Avalon to care for the comatose Magneto. As the Blackbird returns to Earth, it runs into rough turbulence. Flashes of Wolverine's consciousness are shown as he struggles to stay alive. The X-Men on Earth watch in horror as the crew frantically tries to stabilize the ship and care for Wolverine. The ship's hatch opens, and Wolverine sees himself \\"going towards the light\\", but he is pushed back. He awakens in time to prevent Jean Grey from getting sucked out of the Blackbird. The X-Men land on the Earth safely. As Wolverine recovers from his injuries, he and the X-Men learn that his claws were a part of his actual skeletal structure all along, as he now possesses claws made of bone. On Muir Island, the X-Men use Shadowcat to lure in Colossus in an effort to heal his head wound (caused by the X-Cutioner), which they believed was responsible for his defection. The ruse works, and while Nightcrawler fends off the Acolytes' attempts to reclaim their ally, Professor X and Moira MacTaggert heal Colossus, using Cyclops' optic blast. Once again able to return to his human form, Colossus still elects to remain amongst the Acolytes, to keep them in check. Aftermath This story leads directly into the Avengers/X-Men crossover \\"Bloodties\\". * In wiping out Magneto's mind, Professor X unleashes an evil psychic entity, Onslaught, that festers in his own mind, leading to the Onslaught Saga of 1996. * The mind-wiped Magneto did not return until 1997 in Uncanny X-Men #350. * Wolverine lost his adamantium skeleton (and subsequently left the X-Men). He did not get it back until 1999, when Apocalypse rebonded it to his skeleton, shown through flashback sequences during Wolverine (vol. 2) #145. Genesis had attempted the same earlier, but did not succeed (during Wolverine (vol. 2) #99-#100). * With the team in shambles, the three remaining members of Excalibur (Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, and Phoenix) decide to remain on Muir Island, abandoning their operations in Britain. * After the destruction of Avalon, Colossus would later join Excalibur as part of his rehabilitation. * According to Peter David, the idea of Magneto pulling out Wolverine's adamantium came from the plotting of the X-Cutioner's Song crossover. He had sarcastically suggested the removal when they were considering bringing Magneto back, and supposedly it was never meant to be taken seriously. * Nicieza returned to this story in honor of the X-Men's 50th anniversary in the special anthology comic X-Men: Gold #1 (2013). In this short story, we see that while he was erasing Magneto's mind, Xavier gave him a final vision of a utopia that could have come to pass if the two of them had worked together. Tie-in issues #X-Factor #92 #X-Force #25 #Uncanny X-Men #304 #X-Men (vol. 2) #25 #Wolverine (vol. 2) #75 #Excalibur #71 Reception Initial installments of \\"Fatal Attractions\\" sold higher than the issues of the participating series which preceded them, but noticeably less than previous X-Men crossovers. Wizard magazine speculated that this was due to fan disappointment with recent X-Men crossovers, such as X-Cutioner's Song. In other media Several elements of the Fatal Attractions storyline were influenced in the X-Men animated series. In the two-part episode \\"Sanctuary\\", Magneto creates Asteroid M, a human-free orbiting space station, though it was only Cortez who desired to use its weaponry to attack humans. * Fatal Attractions was loosely adapted into a video game entitled X-Men: Children of the Atom in 1994. Much like the comic book storyline, Magneto plans to unleash an electromagnetic pulse on the Earth that will disrupt the magnetic fields and create havoc on the world's electrical systems, ushering in a Dark Age for the Earth's non-mutant population. Unlike the storyline, where Magneto has the Acolytes on his side, Omega Red, the Sentinels, Silver Samurai, Spiral, and the Juggernaut joins forces with Magneto as he promises a mutant run planet. * In the 2003 video game X2: Wolverine's Revenge (whose storyline has more connections to the Marvel Universe than to X2), the events of Fatal Attractions are briefly mentioned during the confrontation between Magneto and Wolverine, with Wolverine reminding the former he didn't forget when Magneto ripped the adamantium out of Wolverine's body.

The ACD brought together the Adelaide Theological Library, from the collections of the three colleges. The library has grown since the merger and in 2006 held over 60,000 volumes, including many dating back before 1850 and some to the 17th century. Within the college grounds is a labyrinth designed by Adelaide stained glass artist Cedar Prest to honour the journeys of refugees and migrants. Symbols incorporated in the labyrinth include a large chalice and a central wafer - a reference to Holy Communion. A stylised version of the labyrinth is used as the college logo. History The ACD started as an ecumenical consortium of the theological colleges of the Anglican (St Barnabas College), Baptist (Burleigh College), Roman Catholic (the St Francis Xavier Seminary, now the Catholic Theological College) and Uniting (Parkin-Wesley College, from December 2008 known as Uniting College for Leadership and Theology) Churches in 1979, with the Bible College of South Australia in 1980, in Adelaide, South Australia. In late September 1997, the then three constituent colleges in Adelaide moved to a campus at Brooklyn Park, South Australia which had been vacated by the Salesian College. Teaching began on 7 October and the ACD campus was officially opened on Sunday, 9 November by the Governor of South Australia, Sir Eric Neal. Nungalinya College was associated with the ACD at one time. Nungalinya College is ecumenical with a focus on theological education and training for ministry for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is located in Darwin, Northern Territory. In 2003, the Uniting Church moved its distance education focused Coolamon College from Brisbane to Adelaide where it joined the ACD In Brisbane it had been a member of the Brisbane College of Theology and also offered Sydney College of Divinity courses. In 2009 the Anglican synod voted in favour of withdrawing St Barnabas' College from the ACD and affiliating with the School of Theology of Charles Sturt University. In 2010, the Catholic theological college withdrew from the consortium to become part of the new Adelaide Theological Centre. Uniting College for Leadership and Theology has been joined by Trinity College Queensland. Trinity was initially a member of the Brisbane College of Theology that was wound up in 2009, and then offered Australian Catholic University qualifications before joining the ACD.

While in high school, he had spent the summer of 1964 pitching against collegiate competition for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. =Minor leagues= After pitching in the low minor leagues from 1967 to 1969 with the Ogden Dodgers, Santa Barbara Dodgers and Albuquerque Dodgers with limited success, Hough's career and fortunes changed dramatically when he learned how to throw a knuckleball in spring training in 1970, leading to a successful season with the Spokane Indians in AAA, where he led the Pacific Coast League in saves and posted a 1.95 ERA. =Los Angeles Dodgers= He made his major league debut against the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1970 but did not join the Dodgers bullpen full-time until the 1973 season. He became a top reliever for the Dodgers from 1973 until he was sold to the Texas Rangers in 1980. With the Dodgers, he was one of the pitchers who served up one of the three home runs that New York Yankees slugger Reggie Jackson hit on three straight pitches in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. Hough with the Los Angeles Dodgers =Texas Rangers= He was converted into a starting pitcher in Texas, where he pitched from 1980 to 1990, making his only All-Star team in 1986. He left Texas as the franchise leader in wins, strikeouts, complete games and losses. He was famous for his \\"dancing knuckleball\\" pitch that he threw around 80% of the time. Hough complemented his knuckleball with a fastball and slider. Hough was well known for throwing a large number of complete games each season and led the league in 1984 with 17, but his last complete game of the season was a misfortunate one as the opposing California Angels' Mike Witt hurled a perfect game. In 1987, Hough, in battery with Geno Petralli, put Petralli in the record books as Petralli committed four passed balls in one inning to tie the major league record of Ray Katt, catching knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm in 1954. The record was later tied by Ryan Lavarnway of the Boston Red Sox in 2013, catching knuckleballer Steven Wright in his first major league start. =Chicago White Sox= He pitched for the Chicago White Sox from 1991 to 1992, where, at 43 years old, he found himself pitching to 43-year-old Carlton Fisk as his batterymate. =Florida Marlins= He joined the expansion Florida Marlins for the 1993 season and started the first regular season game in team history, on April 5, pitching six innings for the win as the Marlins defeated the Dodgers 6-3. He retired at age 46 after the 1994 season. He was the last active player to have been born in the 1940s. =Career totals= During a 25-season career, Hough compiled 216 wins, 2,362 strikeouts and a 3.75 earned run average. His 216 wins rank 86th all-time on the all-time win list, tied with Wilbur Cooper and Curt Schilling. However, Hough also recorded 216 losses, making him the winningest pitcher in history to have lost as many games as he won.

The first carriage clock was invented by Abraham-Louis Breguet for the Emperor Napoleon in 1812. The case, usually plain or gilt- brass, is rectangular with a carrying handle and often set with glass or more rarely enamel or porcelain panels. A feature of carriage clocks is the platform escapement, sometimes visible through a glazed aperture on the top of the case. Carriage clocks use a balance and balance spring for timekeeping and replaced the larger pendulum bracket clock. The factory of Armand Couaillet, in Saint-Nicolas d'Aliermont (France) made thousands of carriage clocks between 1880 and 1920. A carriage clock has in the past been a traditional gift from employers to retiring or long-serving staff. However, in modern times, with changing work patterns and changing desires, this is much less the case. Sources and referencesCharles Allix and Peter Bonnert, Carriage Clocks.

Origins Baxter was born in 1799 at Comber, County Down, Ireland, a son of mariner James Baxter. Raised in a Protestant family, the powerfully built young man, who was educated to read and write, became a farm bailiff at Down. He was convicted for having received a stolen brooch in July 1826, and was sentenced to seven years' penal transportation, to be served in New South Wales. He arrived in Sydney aboard the . N.S.W. convict He was promptly assigned as a farm labourer for free settlers, initially for William Bell in the Hunter Valley, and then other settlers. Through good conduct he obtained his ticket of leave in 1831 while working at Patrick's Plains on the Hunter River. On 19 August 1833 he was granted his Certificate of Freedom.N.S.W. State Records, Convict Index 33/0925, 4/4317, Reel 991. That same month the 33-year-old ruddy-faced Baxter was one of six freed ex-convicts assigned to work (with wages and keep) for 18-year-old novice settler Edward John Eyre at his newly established Hunter River property. Baxter was reputedly married, but his wife died in 1837. At this period Eyre described Baxter as \\"a good cooper and rough carpenter, and ... a most useful, well-behaved man\\", despite his roughness and occasional alcohol binges.Rudolph, Ivan / Eyre: The Forgotten Explorer, (HarperCollins, 2013). p. 31. Explorer and companion of Eyre For the next eight years Baxter was to accompany Eyre through nearly every one of his pastoralist, livestock overlanding, and exploration endeavours, most usually as his faithful overseer and best friend, but sometimes as a partner. For example, Baxter brought 60 head of his own cattle in the herd that he and Eyre overlanded to Adelaide, arriving July 1838. In 1840 Baxter and Eyre were equal minority shareholders in the special survey that led to settlement of the Clare Valley, holding adjacent sections of land.[http://]Northern Argus (Clare SA), 3 October 1941, page 8. Although Baxter lacked Eyre's higher education and sophistication, it could be said that wherever Eyre explored, so also did Baxter. In threatening situations, particularly with potentially hostile Aboriginals, the older and well-built Baxter often provided the strong physical presence which the tall but slightly-built Eyre lacked. In addition, Baxter sometimes scouted and explored districts that Eyre didn't actually visit but nevertheless reported on, he being expedition leader. During their 1839 exploration of Eyre Peninsula, Baxter found a water source near a range of hills he had visited, which Eyre then named Baxter's Range.E.J. Eyre's Autobiographical Narrative, 1832‚Äì39 (Caliban Books, London, 1984). The range, which is sited west of Port Augusta, is today named Baxter Range, with parts being called Corunna Hills. The Baxter Detention Centre which operated near here 2002-07 therefore had the irony of being named after a former convict. Death In 1841 Eyre led the first expedition to cross the Nullarbor Plain, east to west, with Baxter as his overseer. The small party reached Eucla, at the head of the Bight, on 11 March 1841.http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/landscape/discovery/display/60462-eyre,-baxter- and-wylie-expedition  Monument at Eucla to Eyre's expedition Heading further west, the harsh terrain became even more arid. On the night of 29 April 1841, when the exploration party was low on supplies and in desperate need of water, near the coast south of present-day Caiguna in Nuytsland National Park, Baxter was murdered by Yarry and Joey, two of the Indigenous Australians with the group, who took guns and supplies, leaving only Eyre and the Aboriginal Wylie to complete the journey. Eyre had been checking their horses at 10.30pm when Baxter, who had been asleep in his swag, was shot in the chest by a rifle when he aroused and attempted to foil the deserters and their plot. The expedition was at or past the point of no return and morale was low. Eyre and Wylie were fortunate to survive the journey to Albany. Baxter's grave and memorial Eyre and Wylie were unable to dig a grave for Baxter because of sheet rock in that locality. His body was left wrapped in a blanket. In the late 1920s the Western Australian Historical Society organised an expedition to locate Baxter's remains. His scattered bones were discovered approximately 3 km from the coastal cliffs. Those cliffs, officially named Baxter Cliffs, are a section of the Bunda cliffs. Baxter's memorial is a concrete pillar erected in 1930 with a brass plaque reading \\"John Baxter, (explorer), The Companion Of, John Edward Eyre, Was Killed Here By Natives, April 29th 1841\\". The memorial can be accessed by 4-wheel-drive from Caiguna road house. It is approximately 35 km to Baxter's memorial and a further 5 km to Baxter's Lookout (cliffs). The landscape is flat and vegetation stunted. An overnight stay at Baxter's Lookout gives a feel for the expedition's predicament.

Strikebreakers are usually individuals who were not employed by the company prior to the trade union dispute, but rather hired after or during the strike to keep the organization running. \\"Strikebreakers\\" may also refer to workers (union members or not) who cross picket lines to work. Industrial Workers of the World stickerette \\"Don't Scab\\" Industrial Workers of the World stickerette - \\"SCAB\\" The use of strikebreakers is a worldwide phenomenon; however, many countries have passed laws outlawing their use, as they undermine the collective bargaining process. Strikebreakers are used far more frequently in the United States than in any other industrialized country.Norwood, Strikebreaking and Intimidation, 2002. International law The right to strike is not expressly mentioned in any convention of the International Labour Organization (ILO); however, the ILO's Freedom of Association Committee established principles on the right to strike through ongoing rulings.ILO principles concerning the right to strike 2000 Among human rights treaties, only the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains a clause protecting the right to strike. However, like the Social Charter of 1961, the Covenant permits each signatory country to abridge the right to strike.International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 8 (4). The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association and other ILO bodies have, however, interpreted all core ILO conventions as protecting the right to strike as an essential element of the freedom of association. For example, the ILO has ruled that \\"the right to strike is an intrinsic corollary of the right of association protected by Convention No. 87.\\"International Labour Organization, Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining: General Survey of the Reports... 1994. The ILO has also concluded striker replacement, while not in contravention of ILO agreements, carries with it significant risks for abuse and places trade union freedoms \\"in grave jeopardy.\\"Committee on Freedom of Association, Digest of Decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, 2006. The European Social Charter of 1961 was the first international agreement to expressly protect the right to strike.Human Rights Watch, Unfair Advantage: Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States Under International Human Rights Standards, 2000. However, the European Union's Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers permits EU member states to regulate the right to strike.Maastricht Treaty on European Union, Protocol and Agreement on Social Policy, February 7, 1992, 31 LL.M. 247, paragraph 13 under \\"Freedom of association and collective bargaining.\\" National laws Strikebreakers outside the Chicago Tribune during a 1986 strike =Asia=Japanese labor law significantly restricts the ability of both an employer and a union to engage in labor disputes. The law highly regulates labor relations to ensure labor peace and channel conflict into collective bargaining, mediation and arbitration. It bans the use of strikebreakers.Sugeno and Kanowitz, Japanese Employment and Labor Law, 2002; Dau-Schmidt, \\"Labor Law and Industrial Peace: A Comparative Analysis of the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan Under the Bargaining Model,\\" Tulane Journal of International & Comparative Law, 2000. *South Korea bans the use of strikebreakers, although the practice remains common.Parry, \\"Labour Law Draws Roar of Rage From Asian Tiger,\\" The Independent, January 18, 1997. =Europe= In most European countries, strikebreakers are rarely used. Consequently, they are rarely if ever mentioned in most European national labor laws. As mentioned above, it is left to the European Union member states to determine their own policies. *Germany has employment law that protects worker rights, but trade unions and the right to strike are not regulated by statute. The Bundesarbeitsgericht (the Federal Labor Court of Germany) and the Bundesverfassungsgericht (the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany) have, however, issued a large number of rulings which essentially regulate trade union activities such as strikes. Work councils, for example, may not strike at all, but trade unions retain an almost unlimited ability to strike. The widespread use of work councils, however, channels most labor disputes and reduces the likelihood of strikes. Recent efforts to enact a comprehensive federal labor relations law that regulates strikes, lockouts and the use of strikebreakers failed.K√∂rner, \\"German Labor Law in Transition,\\" German Law Journal, April 2005; Westfall and Thusing, \\"Strikes and Lockouts in Germany and Under Federal Legislation in the United States: A Comparative Analysis,\\" Boston College International & Comparative Law Review, 1999. * United Kingdom laws permit strikebreaking, and courts have significantly restricted the right of unions to punish members who act as strikebreakers.Ewing, \\"Laws Against Strikes Revisited,\\" in Future of Labour Law, 2004. =North America=Canada has federal industrial relations laws that strongly regulate the use of strikebreakers. Although many Canadian labor unions today advocate for even stronger regulations, scholars point out that Canadian labor law has far greater protections for union members and the right to strike than American labor law, which has significantly influenced the development of labor relations in Canada.Logan, \\"How 'Anti-Union' Laws Saved Canadian Labour: Certification and Striker Replacements in Post-War Industrial Relations,\\" Relations Industrielles/Industrial Relations, January 2002. In Quebec, the use of strikebreakers is illegal,Quebec Labour Code Section 109.1 but companies may try to remain open with only managerial personnel. *Mexico has a federal labor law that requires companies to cease operations during a legal strike, effectively preventing the use of strikebreakers. *The U.S. Supreme Court held in NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., 304 U.S. 333 (1938) that an employer may not discriminate on the basis of union activity in reinstating employees at the end of a strike. The ruling effectively encourages employers to hire strikebreakers so that the union loses majority support in the workplace when the strike ends.Getman and Kohler, \\"The Story of NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.,\\" in Labor Law Stories, 2005, pp. 49-50. The Mackay Court also held that employers enjoy the unrestricted right to permanently replace strikers with strikebreakers.Getman and Kohler, \\"The Story of NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.,\\" in Labor Law Stories, 2005, p. 13. Synonyms Strikebreaking is also known as black- legging or blacklegging. American lexicographer Stephanie Smith suggests that the word has to do with bootblacking or shoe polish, for an early occurrence of the word was in conjunction with an 1803 American bootmaker's strike.Smith, Household Words: Bloomers, Sucker, Bombshell, Scab, Nigger, Cyber, p. 98. But British industrial relations expert J.G. Riddall notes that it may have a racist connotation, as it was used in this way in 1859 in the United Kingdom: \\"If you dare work we shall consider you as blacks...\\"Riddall, p. 209. Lexicographer Geoffrey Hughes, however, notes that blackleg and scab are both references to disease, as in the blackleg infectious bacterial disease of sheep and cattle caused by Clostridium chauvoei. He dates the first use of the term blackleg in reference to strikebreaking to the United Kingdom in 1859. The use of the term blackleg for a strikebreaker was, however, previously recorded in 1832 during the trial of special constable George Weddell for killing and slaying Cuthbert Skipsey, a striking pitman, near Chirton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.Tyne Mercury, 10 July 1832 Hughes observes that the term was once generally used to indicate a scoundrel, a villain, or a disreputable person.Hughes, p. 466. However, the Northumbrian folk song Blackleg Miner is believed to originate from the 1844 strike, which would predate Hughes's reference. David John Douglass claims that the term blackleg has its origins in coal mining, as strikebreakers would often neglect to wash their legs, which would give away that they had been working whilst others had been on strike. Hughes notes that the use of the term scab can be traced back to the Elizabethan era in England, and is much more clearly rooted in the concept of disease (e.g., a diseased person) and a sickened appearance. The word is occasionally still used as a general insult in Britain; for example, during a mock funeral for Margaret Thatcher in 2013 in Goldthorpe, the word scab was spelled out in flowers as part of the display.Goldthorpe hosts anti-Margaret Thatcher funeral A traditional English proverb, which advises against gossip, is \\"He that is a blab is a scab\\". John McIlroy has suggested that there is a distinction between a blackleg and a scab. He defines a scab as an outsider who is recruited to replace a striking worker, whereas a blackleg is one already employed who goes against a democratic decision of their colleagues to strike, and instead continues to work.McIlroy, John, Strike: How to fight and how to win, page 150 (London, 1984), quoted in The fact that McIlroy specified that this should be a \\"democratic\\" decision has led the historian David Amos to question whether the Nottinghamshire miners in 1984‚Äì85 were true blacklegs, given the lack of a democratic vote on the strike. Strikebreakers are also known as knobsticks. The term appears derived from the word knob, in the sense of something that sticks out, and from the card-playing term nob, as someone who cheats.

Biography  Statue of Georg Spalatin, Schlosskirche, Wittenberg Burkhardt was born at Spalt (from which he took the Latinized name \\"Spalatinus\\"), near Nuremberg, where his father was a tanner. He went to Nuremberg for his education when he was thirteen years of age, and soon afterwards to the University of Erfurt, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1499. There he attracted the notice of Nikolaus Marschalk, the most influential professor, who made Spalatin his amanuensis and took him to the new University of Wittenberg in 1502. Here he lived in quarters on Schlossplatz just east of Schlosskirche, Wittenberg.Plaque to Spalatin, Wittenberg In 1505 Spalatin returned to Erfurt to study jurisprudence. He was recommended to Conrad Mutianus, and was welcomed by the little band of German humanists of whom Mutianus was chief. His friend acquired a post for him as teacher of novices in the monastery at Georgenthal, and in 1508 he was ordained priest by Bishop Johann von Laasphe, who had ordained Martin Luther. In 1509 Mutianus recommended him to Frederick III the Wise, the Elector of Saxony, who employed him to act as tutor to his nephew, the future elector, John Frederick. Spalatin speedily gained the confidence of the elector, who sent him to Wittenberg in 1511 to act as tutor to his nephews, and procured for him a canon's stall in Altenburg. In 1512 the elector made him his librarian. He was promoted to be court chaplain and secretary, and took charge of all the elector's private and public correspondence. His solid scholarship, and especially his unusual mastery of Greek, made him indispensable to the Saxon court. Spalatin had never cared for theology, and, although a priest and a preacher, had been a humanist. How he first became acquainted with Luther is impossible to say  probably at Wittenberg  but the reformer from the first exercised a great power over him, and became his chief counsellor in all moral and religious matters. His letters to Luther have been lost, but Luther's answers remain, and are extremely interesting. There is scarcely any fact in the opening history of the Reformation which is not connected in some way with Spalatin's name. He read Luther's writings to the elector, and translated for his benefit those in Latin into German. Spalatin accompanied Frederick to the Diet of Augsburg in 1518, and shared in the negotiations with the papal legates, Thomas Cajetan and Karl von Miltitz. He was with the elector when Charles V was chosen emperor and when he was crowned. He was with his master at the Diet of Worms. In short, he stood beside Frederick as his confidential adviser in all the troubled diplomacy of the earlier years of the Reformation. Spalatin would have dissuaded Luther again and again from publishing books or engaging in overt acts against the papacy, but when the thing was done none was so ready to translate the book or to justify the act. On the death of Frederick the Wise in 1525, Spalatin no longer lived at the Saxon court. But he attended the imperial diets, and was the constant and valued adviser of the electors, John and John Frederick. He went into residence as canon at Altenburg, and incited the chapter to institute reforms, somewhat unsuccessfully. He married in the same year. During the later portion of his life, from 1526 onwards, Spalatin was chiefly engaged in the visitation of churches and schools in the Electorate of Saxony, reporting on the confiscation and application of ecclesiastical revenues, and he was asked to undertake the same work for Albertine Saxony. He was also permanent visitor of Wittenberg University. Shortly before his death he fell into a state of profound melancholy, and died at Altenburg. He was buried in the vault of the St. Bartholomew church. Works Spalatin left behind him a large number of literary remains, both published and unpublished.

It was based on the 1928 satirical novel The Twelve Chairs by Soviet authors Ilf and Petrov, which has been adapted many times (including a 1970 version directed by Mel Brooks). Plot Mario Beretti (Vittorio Gassman) is a young Italian-American barber. He runs a barber shop located near a construction site that boasts few customers. His life reaches a turning point when he is notified of the death of his aunt living in England, who named him her sole heir. Mario rushes to England and learns that his inheritance consists of not much; only thirteen antique chairs that have a certain value. He sells them in order to cover his transportation costs, but soon learns from his aunt Laura's last message that inside one of the chairs is a fortune in jewels. He tries to buy back the chairs, but is unsuccessful in doing so. With the help of lovely American antiques dealer Pat (Sharon Tate), working in the antiques shop in front of Aunt Laura's house, where he sold the chairs, the two then set out on a bizarre quest to track down the chairs that takes them from London to Paris and to Rome. Along the way, they meet a bunch of equally bizarre characters, including the driver of a furniture moving van named Albert (Terry-Thomas); a prostitute named Judy (Myl√®ne Demongeot); Maurice (Orson Welles), the leader of a traveling theater company that stages a poor version of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; the Italian entrepreneur Carlo Di Seta (Vittorio De Sica); and his vivacious daughter Stefanella (Ottavia Piccolo). The bizarre chase ends in Rome, where the chair containing the jewels finds its way into a truck and is collected by nuns who auction it off to charity. With nothing much left to do as a result of the failure of his quest, Mario travels back to New York City by ship as Pat sees him off and waves goodbye to him. The film ends with Mario returning to New York City and to his barber shop. His friends over at the other (and more lavish) shop join him, as do two construction workers and his last customer Randomhouse (Lionel Jeffries). It is there that Mario makes a strange discovery: shortly before his departure for Europe, he invented a way to make hair regrow miraculously. He then laughs ecstatically over his discovery.

Orson Welles and Tim Brooke-Taylor had their scenes filmed during a break from shooting Welles' comedic film One Man Band. Brooke-Taylor recalled, Because the script for Sharon Tate's scenes called for several semi-nude scenes, the director arranged to film those scenes first. As filming (and her pregnancy) progressed, the director obscured Tate's stomach with large purses and scarves. This is most apparent in the scene following her ride in the furniture mover's van. The Thirteen Chairs was Sharon Tate's final film, with many people saying that she had a knack for comedy and were excited for her next film contract (equal to over $1,000,000 in today‚Äôs money). Home media The film was released through rental only by Force Video in 1986 under the Thirteen Chairs name, and again a year later by Continental Video, under the original 12 + 1 name. On 12 March 2008 the film was released on DVD in Italy by 01 Distribution. This version is in Italian, lacks English subtitles, and doesn't include an English audio track.

It was invented by Simon Willard, originally of Grafton, Massachusetts, later of Roxbury, Massachusetts, and patented in 1802. The banjo clock normally lacks a striking mechanism and indicates time only by its hands and dial, for which reason some horologists may insist upon calling it a timepiece rather than a true clock. In popular usage though, no such distinction is made. The banjo style of wooden case usually features a round opening for a painted dial, a long-waisted throat, and a rectangular pendulum box with hinged door. Both the throat and door are ornamented with reverse- painted (verre √©glomis√©) glass panels, and the case is usually flanked by curved and pierced brass frets. A finial mounted atop the case usually takes the form of a cast-brass eagle or a turned, giltwood acorn. Only 4,000 authentic Simon Willard banjo clocks were made. The style was widely copied by other members of the Willard family of clockmakers and many others clockmakers, both craftsmen and industrial manufacturers. Variants of the banjo-style clock made by others include examples with square or diamond- shaped dials, and the extremely opulent, heavily gilt \\"girandole\\" style.

They were the first type of clock widely used in private homes. They probably originated before 1500 but only became common after 1600; in Britain around 1620. They became obsolete in the 19th century.  Origin of the name  There are two theories of the origin of the name \\"lantern clock\\". One is that it refers to brass, the main metal of which English lantern clocks are made. Clocks were first made on the continent, at first of iron with iron wheels, and then later with brass wheels. Later still, in France, Belgium and The Netherlands, clocks began to be made from brass.Robey, J.A., \\"Iron Crossings and Brass Rims\\", The Horological Journal, British Horological Institute, Newark, England,July 2015 Brass alloys were then called latten, and it seems likely that brass clocks would have been called \\"latten clocks\\" (or \\"latten horloge\\" or \\"latten uhr\\" in the native languages) to distinguish them from iron clocks, and that \\"lantern\\" could be an English interpretation or corruption of latten. The other is that the name derived from the shape; the clock resembles a rectangular lantern of that period, and like a lantern was hung on the wall. In inventories of deceased clockmakers, lantern clocks are usually referred to as \\"house clocks\\", \\"chamber clocks\\" or simply \\"clocks\\", since in 17th century England they were almost the only type of domestic clocks that existed. It was only after a century had passed, when other types of domestic clocks began to be used in British houses, that more descriptive names for it appeared. Other names used for lantern clocks are \\"bedpost\\", \\"birdcage\\" or \\"Cromwellian\\" clocks. \\"Sheep's head clock\\" was a nickname term for a type of lantern clock that had an extremely large chapter ring covering almost the entire front.  Origin of lantern clocks  The English lantern clock is closely related to lantern clocks that can be found on the European continent. A group of craftsmen from the Low Countries and France, of which some were clockmakers, had established themselves in London at the end of the 16th century. At the same time the middle classes in towns and cities of England began to prosper and the need arose for domestic clocks. Until that time clocks in English houses were confined to the nobility; ordinary people were dependent on sundials, or the tower clocks of local churches. Clock that was signed 'N. Vallin 1598' Picture of a replica in the Dutch Museum 'Van Speelklok tot Pierement' in Utrecht. The original clock is displayed in the British Museum in London. It is generally accepted that the first lantern clocks in England were made by Frauncoy Nowe and Nicholas Vallin, two Huguenots who had fled from the Low Countries.  Style characteristics  Lantern clocks were made almost entirely of brass, whereas most earlier clocks had been constructed from iron and wood. Typical lantern clocks comprised a square case on ball or urn feet, a large circular dial (with a chapter ring extending beyond the width of the case on early examples), a single hour hand, and a large bell and finial. The clocks usually had ornate pierced fretwork on top of the frame. The main style characteristics of English lantern clocks are similar to its Continental relatives: a wall clock with square bottom and top plates surmounted by a large bell, four corner pillars, a series of vertical plates positioned behind each other and a 30-hour movement with one or more weights. At the start of the 17th century, the style gradually evolved to a standard to which all clockmakers more or less complied. The guild supervised the clockmakers, who were compelled to work within a prescribed method. Suppliers to the clockmakers' trade contributed to this general style as well. For example, the brass founders supplied stylistically identical clock posts to several clockmakers. In contrast to the Dutch variants, such as stool clocks, English lantern clocks were entirely made of metal (brass and steel). Lantern clocks were originally weight-driven: usually one weight for time keeping and a second for striking. A few later lantern-style clocks were constructed with spring mechanisms, and many surviving examples of the original weight-driven type have been converted to spring or pendulum mechanisms.  Guild system  In only a few decades the lantern clock became very popular in London, and from there its popularity spread to the entire country. This is evident from the large number of lantern clocks that still exist. Dozens of clockmakers produced great numbers of these clocks in the city of London during the 17th century. This huge productivity was the result of the high demand for this popular clock in combination with an effective guild system. In 1631 King Charles I granted a charter for a clockmaker guild in London: the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, which exists to this day. Many of the well-known clockmakers from that era were freemen of this guild. Many small companies were established in Lothbury in London that functioned as suppliers for the clockmakers. A clockmaker could benefit from the services of brass founders who supplied cast brass clock parts, dial plates, finials, pillars, frets etc., or employ engravers who would carry out the engraving of the dial plates and frets. The guild assured the quality of the products that left the clockmakers' workshops. Before a clockmaker could become a freeman, able to set up his own shop, he had to spend 7 years as an apprentice learning the trade. This ensured independent clockmakers a plentiful supply of apprentices, who were also cheap labourers who helped to attain this high productivity. Example of a tulip engraving on the dial of a lantern clock  Influence of the Renaissance  Style characteristics were copied from prints that were available for craftsmen. Under the influence of the Renaissance, prints with motives and patterns from the Classical antiquity found their way to the workshops. They served as examples for the clock pillars that were inspired by columns from Greek temples. During the 17th century the tulip became very popular to an extent of a real tulip mania. Prints with pictures of tulips were a rewarding subject for the adornment of the dial plates of lantern clocks. In the early 17th century, lantern clocks got their characteristic shape, which hardly changed during the 17th and halfway through the next century as a result of all this. Bracket clock movement with anchor escapement and count wheel striking.  Clock parts  The London Clockmakers equipped their lantern clocks with four pillars inspired by classical columns. Attached to these pillars are classical vase-shaped finials and well-shaped feet. To those finials a bell strap is attached that spreads from four corners and holds a bell. To hide the hammer and the clock movement from the spectator three frets are attached to the finials. The front fret is pierced and engraved whereas the two side frets are pierced but usually left blank. The front of the clock case consists of an engraved dial plate on which a circular dial ring is attached. Almost all lantern clocks originally had just one clock hand to indicate the hours. A standard lantern clock strikes the hours on a large bell and is often equipped with an alarm that rings the same bell. Two doors provide access to the movement and are hinged at the sides of the clock. One or more weights are hanging from ropes or chains at the bottom of the clock. Lantern clock by Langley Bradley, London, c. 1700. Converted to clockwork mechanism, hence missing its weights.  Obsolescence  Lantern clocks were produced in vast numbers during the decades before the pioneering invention of the pendulum by the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens in 1656. Before this invention, lantern clocks used a balance wheel lacking a balance spring for their timekeeping element, which limited their accuracy to perhaps 15 minutes per day. Shortly after Huygens' invention, the bob pendulum was introduced in England, and most English clockmakers adopted the new system quickly. The pendulum increased the accuracy of clocks so greatly that many existing clocks were converted, with pendulums being added at the back. Measuring time became much more accurate, but most clockmakers kept building lantern clocks without minute hands: this maybe just a matter of tradition. The result was that clockmakers started to develop other types of domestic clocks. Longcase clocks with 8-day movements made lantern clocks obsolete, and gradually lantern clocks disappeared from the London interiors in the first decades of the 18th century. In rural areas lantern clocks were produced until the beginning of the 19th century, and in those years they were also exported to countries like Turkey, and supplied with oriental numbers on their dials. In the Victorian era there was a revival of interest in antique lantern clocks. Unfortunately this also meant that many clocks of renowned makers were stripped of their movements, which were replaced by 'modern' winding movements. Nowadays unmodified original lantern clocks are very rare. References Hana, W.F.

(23 November 1785 ‚Äì 8 May 1853) was a Dutch Jesuit, elected twenty-first Superior-General of the Society of Jesus. Early Life and Formation He was born to a once- Calvinist family emigrated from Frankfurt to Amsterdam, where they became Catholic. When Jan Philipp, the youngest of three brothers, was sixteen he graduated from the gymnasium of his native town. From there he passed to the Athenaeum Illustre (high school), and continued his classical studies for four years under Professor David Jacob van Lennep. As an altarboy at de Krijtberg church of Amsterdam the young Roothaan came in touch with ex-Jesuits priests who sent him to Russia when he expressed the desire to become a Jesuit. In 1804 he left his homeland to join the Society of Jesus whose survival in Russia had been recently approved by Pope Pius VII (1801). On the conclusion of his novitiate in Dunaburg, Latvia, he was appointed teacher at the Jesuit gymnasium at Dunaburg from 1806 to 1809. He had already mastered Polish; and he also spoke French, while the classical Latin, Greek, and Hebrew were also familiar to him. He subsequently studied philosophy and theology at the Jesuit College in Polotsk, and in 1812 was ordained priest.  Career  The following four years (1812‚Äì16) were spent as professor of rhetoric at Pusza; this was the stormy era of the Napoleonic Wars, the same time period that saw Pius VII restore universally the Society of Jesus (1814). The next four years, 1816 to 1820, Roothaan worked partly as teacher and partly in pastoral duties at Orsha in White Russia (modern Belarus). However he had hardly made his final religious profession in the Society (1819) that he was sent into exile by the banishment of the Jesuits from Russia (1820). The exile road ended in Brig, Switzerland. There again he taught rhetoric for three years. Roothaan was subsequently appointed to the rectorship of the newly founded college at Turin and soon after, in 1829, vice-provincial of Italy.  General Congregation XXI (1829)  At the death of Luigi Fortis, the 21st General Congregation was convoked, which, on the 9 July 1829 (at the 4th ballot), elected Jan Philipp Roothaan as Superior General. The mandate given by the Congregation to Roothaan was to strengthen and stabilize the fledgling 'new' Society: going slow on opening new schools, improving the intellectual and spiritual formation of the Jesuits, reintroducing practices of the past (Annual letters, Congregations of procurators every three years, etc.), keeping the Latin language for official communications, being strict with regard to admission to final profession, etc.  Superior General Roothaan is credited with preserving and strengthening the internal spirit of the Society. To this object he devoted nine of his eleven circular letters, starting with the first, soon after entering office. It was a sort of programme De amore Societatis et Instituti nostri (1830). To achieve this he also worked on the new edition of the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius, providing it with an introduction and explanatory notes. *In 1832 he published the new Ratio Studiorum (Order of Studies) after a commission met in Rome in 1830-31. But times were not ripe for a pedagogical reform. The text was a reassertion of the benefits of traditional Jesuit education. New trends and liberal ideas were suspect. *Roothaan increased the breadth of apostolic activities, and in a vibrant letter (De missionum exterarum desiderio, 1833) he called for volunteers for the foreign missions. At the end of his term (1853) Jesuits in overseas missions (America, Africa, Asia) were 1014. *Traditional apostolic works also received his support, such as preaching, the rural missions. When an epidemic of cholera hit Rome in 1837 he sent the Jesuits to organise relief among the sick. *Intellectual work was restarted: the Bollandists and historical research. The La Civilt√† Cattolica was started. And with intellectual work, Jesuits renewed with controversies as well, as with the Italian philosopher Antonio Rosmini. On the road Those were troubled times. Jesuits often suffered banishment from a country or another, especially in the Revolutions of 1848. Roothaan was sending them letters of encouragement in the face of tribulations. Roothaan himself had to flee Rome for two years, at the time of the Roman Republic. This gave him the opportunity to visit Jesuit communities and works in France, Belgium, Netherlands, England, Ireland; he was the first Superior General to ever do it. However, on his return, his health was broken, his strength began to fail, and fits of weakness announced his approaching end. Evaluation After 21 years at the helm of the Society Roothaan died on the 8 May 1853, in Rome. During these years the number of Jesuits increased from 2137 to 5209 and high schools passed from 55 to 100. A highly talented man and very able administrator Roothaan displayed also an indefatigable zeal for the restoration and spiritual uplift of the Society. He was also a churchman of his time, that is not really open to the socio-political ideas that were shaping Europe in the middle of the 19th century. Roothaan's biographer summed up his spirit well: Impetuous by nature, he governed all passions by the exercise of Christian self-denial, so that a most measured moderation in all things forms his distinctive characteristic.

Life and career O'Neill was born to Irish parents in Romford, East London, and began his career working in a photographic unit for an airline at London's Heathrow Airport. During this time, he photographed a sleeping figure in a waiting area who, by happenstance, was revealed to be Home Secretary Rab Butler. O'Neill thereafter found further employment on Fleet Street with The Daily Sketch in 1959. His first professional job was to photograph Laurence Olivier. During the 1960s, in addition to photographing contemporary celebrities such as Judy Garland, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, he also photographed members of the British royal family and prominent politicians, showing a more human side to these subjects than had usually been portrayed‚Äîhis photographs capture his subjects candidly or in unconventional settings.

Gaston F√©bus [also spelt Phoebus] (30 April 1331 ‚Äì 1391) was the eleventh count of Foix (as Gaston III) and viscount of B√©arn (as Gaston X) from 1343 until his death. Early life Gaston was born either in Orthez or Foix, the eldest son of Gaston II/IX (1308‚Äì1343). As the lord's eldest son, he was given the name, Gaston. He later adopted F√©bus as a nickname. In its classic spelling, Phoebus, it is one of the names of the sun-god, Apollo, and is apt because of Gaston F√©bus's golden hair. His native language was Gascon (a dialect of Occitan), but he was also fluent in French. He wrote a treatise on hunting in French, and an Occitan song, Se Canta, has been ascribed to him. One contemporary chronicler, Jean Froissart, records that he \\"very willingly spoke to me not in his native Gascon but in proper and elegant French\\".Paul Cohen, \\"Linguistic Politics on the Periphery: Louis XIII, B√©arn, and the Making of French as an Official Language in Early Modern France\\", When Languages Collide: Perspectives on Language Conflict, Language Competition, and Language Coexistence (Ohio State University Press, 2003), pp. 165‚Äì200, at 189 n. 40. Count of Foix B√©arn had passed to the county of Foix in 1290. F√©bus paid homage to the French king for his own county, but starting in 1347 he refused to give homage for B√©arn, which he claimed as an independent fief, with its chief seat his stronghold at Pau, a site that had been fortified by the 11th century, which was later made the official capital of B√©arn in 1464. Starting in 1374, court minutes in the sovereign viscounty were dated with reference to the lord of B√©arn. He established international diplomatic relations with Navarre, Castile and Aragon, taking advantage to a large extent of the weakness of the French crown. He started a policy of rapprochement to the realms to the south of the Pyrenees. He, for example, married Agnes, daughter of Philip III and Joan II of Navarre, with the acquiescence of the French king Philip VI. While Gaston eventually repudiated Agnes, he pursued the establishment of a Pyrenean realm under his leadership, and thus secure the control of the thriving commercial route of Toulouse-Bayonne. His intent to reinforce authority across all the area was halfhearted due to economic constraints. Although he designated the king of France as his successor, eventually that did not happen, since the newly established Estates-General of B√©arn prevented it. He was succeeded as count of Foix and sovereign viscount of B√©arn by Mathieu of Foix-Castelbon. A fortune won in battle The House of B√©arn-Foix was engaged in a long running feud with the House of Armagnac. In 1362, a battle was fought between the two noble houses at Launac. F√©bus was victorious and succeeded in capturing his chief rivals, whom he ransomed for a vast fortune of at least 600,000 florins. This money was stored in the Moncade tower in Orthez, where F√©bus also created a gallery of portraits and military trophies to commemorate the event.  Castles  The constructions of Gaston F√©bus all have in common the same plan whatever its surface and its location. The plan is as follows: a polygonal enclosure to which are built buildings forming an interior courtyard, a quadrangular tower straddling the curtain wall (pentagonal at the Ch√¢teau de Moncade), sometimes a second tower, as well as a ditch spanned by a drawbridge.

In late 1388, the chronicler, Jean Froissart, visited the County of Foix and recorded the splendour of F√©bus' court at Orthez. He noted that F√©bus describes the three \\"special delights\\" of his life as \\"arms, love and hunting\\". Livre de chasse (Book of the Hunt) F√©bus was one of the greatest huntsmen of his day, and hunted his entire life ‚Äì he died of a stroke while washing his hands after returning from a bear hunt. His Livre de chasse (Book of the Hunt) was written between 1387‚Äì1389 and dedicated to Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Recorded in the book are different stages of hunting different animals, as well as describing animal behavior, offering advice to less well-off gentry about how to enjoy hunting without bankrupting themselves, and is even sympathetic to the peasant poacher because he too has the hunting instinct. It is the classic treatise on Medieval hunting, and was described by scholar Hannele Klemettil√§ as \\"one of the most influential texts of its era\\". Some forty-four 15th and 16th century illuminated manuscripts survive, the most famous being that held by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, which has exquisite miniatures, illustrating the hunt. Marriage and children F√©bus married Agn√®s of Navarre (1334‚Äì1396), daughter of Joan II of Navarre and Philip III of Navarre in 1348. They had a son: * Gaston (1361-1382), married B√©atrice d'Armagnac (1362-1410), daughter of John II of Armagnac. He was also the father of four illegitimate children: * Garcia de B√©arn, viscount of Ossau, husband of Anne de Lavedan; * Peranudet de B√©arn, died in childhood; * Bernal de Foix died about 1381, first count of Medinaceli by his marriage to Isabel de la Cerda, lady of Huelva, Gibrale√≥n and of Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a, the forefather of the dukes of Medinaceli; * Jean de B√©arn, also called Yvain de Lescar, was F√©bus' favourite son, dying on 30 January 1393 without issue, of burns accidentally caused at the Bal des ardents. Betrayal of the Count's son Gaston III outside the Ch√¢teau de Pau. As Jean Froissart records, F√©bus was betrayed by his son who also bore the dynastic name, Gaston, and who tried to kill his father using poison given to him by Charles II of Navarre. F√©bus caught his son in the act and imprisoned him. In a subsequent violent quarrel, F√©bus stabbed his son, who died. Following Gaston's death, F√©bus had no legitimate descendants. In 1393, in Paris at a masquerade given by the Queen of France, Isabeau of Bavaria, one of Gaston F√©bus's four recorded illegitimate sons, Yvain de Foix, was burned to death when his costume, along with the costumes of four others, caught fire from a torch at the Bal des Ardents.  Posterity  = Popular Culture = In 1839, Alexandre Dumas published a long story taking F√©bus as its central character, in his novel Act√©. In the 20th century, the novel by Myriam and Gaston de B√©arn, La Vie fabuleuse de Gaston Ph≈ìbus (1959), was a great success. This romantic trilogy was adapted to television in 1978 in Gaston F√©bus: the Lion of the Pyrenees. In March 2020, the ethnologist and ethnographer Emmanuel Larrouturou revealed that the calligraphy of Gaston F√©bus' signature is an ingenious graphic device revealing, by superimposing loose sheets, various forms related to totemism.

A British Mark II steel Brodie helmet as issued in the Second World War A kettle hat, also known as a war hat, is a type of helmet made of iron or steel in the shape of a brimmed hat. There are many design variations. The only common element is a wide brim that afforded extra protection to the wearer. It gained its common English language name from its resemblance to a metal cooking pot (the original meaning of kettle). The kettle hat was common all over Medieval Europe. It was called Eisenhut in German and chapel de fer in French (both names mean \\"iron hat\\" in English).Connolly, Gillingham, and Lazenby p. 178 Characteristics and use Though similar brimmed helmets are depicted in illustrations of the Carolingian period, their use seems to have disappeared soon after. In the late 12th century, alongside the development of the enclosed helmet, the brimmed helmet makes a reappearance in Western Europe. Also in the 12th century the brimmed helmet begins to be depicted in Byzantine art, and it has been suggested that it was a Byzantine development.Nicolle, David (1996), p. 163 Early examples were made in the spangenhelm method, of a skull composed of framework filled with separate triangular plates, to which a brim was added. Later kettle hats were raised from a single piece of iron. Of a simple design requiring less time and skill to produce than some other helmet types, it was relatively inexpensive. It was worn most commonly by infantry, however, it was also used by cavalry and even men-at-arms. The wide brim gave good protection against blows from above, such as from cavalry swords, and was very useful in siege warfare as the wide brim would protect the wearer from projectiles shot or dropped from above. It could be worn with or without a mail coif, or later a mail standard or plate gorget, and was secured by a chin strap. The kettle hat had an advantage over some other types of helmet, in that it did not interfere with the wearer's vision, hearing or breathing.De Vries and Smith, pp. 71-72 Hat-shaped helmets were not just a European invention. Japanese Ashigaru infantrymen wore the jingasa, a helmet shaped like the Japanese form of the conical Asian hat. When steel helmets reappeared in World War I, the kettle hat made its comeback as the British Brodie helmet (often called tin hat), as well as the French Adrian helmet. These kettle helmets were also used in World War II by the British, Commonwealth forces (such as Australia and Canada).Bedford, p. 116 The British produced a helmet for civilian use in World War II designed to give more protection to the head and neck from above.

The Daniell cell is a type of electrochemical cell invented in 1836 by John Frederic Daniell, a British chemist and meteorologist, and consists of a copper pot filled with a copper (II) sulfate solution, in which is immersed an unglazed earthenware container filled with sulfuric acid and a zinc electrode. He was searching for a way to eliminate the hydrogen bubble problem found in the voltaic pile, and his solution was to use a second electrolyte to consume the hydrogen produced by the first. Zinc sulfate may be substituted for the sulfuric acid. The Daniell cell was a great improvement over the existing technology used in the early days of battery development. A later variant of the Daniell cell called the gravity cell or crowfoot cell was invented in the 1860s by a Frenchman named Callaud and became a popular choice for electrical telegraphy. The Daniell cell is also the historical basis for the contemporary definition of the volt, which is the unit of electromotive force in the International System of Units. The definitions of electrical units that were proposed at the 1881 International Conference of Electricians were designed so that the electromotive force of the Daniell cell would be about 1.0 volts. With contemporary definitions, the standard potential of the Daniell cell at 25 ¬∞C is actually 1.10 V. Chemistry In the Daniell cell, copper and zinc electrodes are immersed in a solution of copper(II) sulfate and zinc sulfate, respectively. At the anode (negative electrode), zinc is oxidized per the following half reaction: The two half-cell form of the Daniell cell for classroom demonstrations :Zn(s) ‚Üí Zn2+(aq) \\\\+ 2e‚àí . . (Standard electrode reduction potential ‚àí0.7618 V )Michael Clugston, Rosalind Flemming, Advanced Chemistry, p. 224, Oxford University Press, 2000 . National Bureau of Standards, Zinc and its Alloys, p. 40, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1931 . At the cathode (positive electrode), copper is reduced per the following reaction: :Cu2+(aq) \\\\+ 2e‚àí ‚Üí Cu(s) . . (Standard electrode reduction potential +0.340 V ) Note that positively charged copper ions move towards the positive electrode, driven by a reduction in chemical energy. The total reaction is: :Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ‚Üí Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s) . . (Open- circuit voltage 1.1018 V ) These processes result in the accumulation of solid copper at the cathode and the corrosion of the zinc electrode into the solution as zinc cations. The Daniell cell produces approximately 213 kJ per mole (65 g) of zinc. This energy can mostly be attributed to the 207 kJ/mol weaker bonding (smaller magnitude of the cohesive energy) in zinc compared to copper metal, which can be explained in terms of the lack of bonding via partially filled d-orbitals in zinc. Schmidt-Rohr, K. (2018). \\"How Batteries Store and Release Energy: Explaining Basic Electrochemistry\\" J. Chem. Educ. 95: 1801-1810. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.8b00479 In classroom demonstrations, a form of the Daniell cell known as two half cells is often used due to its simplicity. The two half cells each support one half of the reactions described above. A wire and light bulb may connect the two electrodes. Excess electrons produced by the oxidation of zinc metal are ‚Äúpushed‚Äù out of the anode, which is therefore the negative electrode, travel through the wire and are \\"pulled\\" into the copper cathode where they are consumed by the reduction of copper ions. This provides an electrical current that illuminates the bulb. Since neither half reaction will occur independently of the other, the two half cells must be connected in a way that will allow ions to move freely between them. A porous barrier or ceramic disk may be used to separate the two solutions while allowing the flow of sulfate ions. When the half cells are placed in two entirely different and separate containers, a salt bridge is often used to connect the two cells. The salt bridge typically contains a high concentration of potassium nitrate (a salt that will not interfere chemically with the reaction in either half-cell). In the above wet-cell during discharge, nitrate anions in the salt bridge move into the zinc half-cell in order to balance the increase in Zn2+ ions. At the same time, potassium ions from the salt bridge move into the copper half-cell in order to replace the Cu2+ ions being precipitated onto the copper electrode. If the cell is connected to a potential source (e.g. a battery charger) such that the potential difference of the source is slightly higher than the cell emf (1.1 v) then the current flow could be reversed and the reaction would become: :Zn2+(aq) \\\\+ 2e‚àí ‚Üí Zn(s) :Cu(s) ‚Üí Cu2+(aq) \\\\+ 2e‚àí or, :Zn2+(aq) \\\\+ Cu(s) ‚Üí Zn(s) \\\\+ Cu2+(aq) Hence, the Daniell cell is reversible, if the current drawn from (or fed to) it is small. The Daniell cell can be used to ‚Äògenerate‚Äô electricity, by consuming an electrode, or to store electricity. Development =Daniell's original construction= Diagram of early Daniell cell published by Daniell in 1839. In this design the original perforated disc has become a cylinder inside the upper part of the cell to hold copper sulfate crystals Daniell first constructed his cell in 1836.Elizabeth H. Oakes, A to Z of STS Scientists, p. 72, Infobase Publishing, 2009 . His original design consisted of a 3.5 inch diameter copper cylinder. A copper disc perforated with numerous holes was placed across the cylinder recessed down from the top. A tube of ox gullet hung from a large hole in the centre of the perforated copper disc. A 0.5 inch diameter zinc rod hung inside this ox-gullet tube suspended from wooden supports. The copper vessel was filled with sulfuric acid solution saturated with copper sulfate to above the level of the perforated disc. The ox-gullet tube was filled with sulfuric acid solution. Copper sulfate crystals were piled on the perforated copper disc to keep the solution saturated. The ox-gullet acts as a porous membrane allowing passage of ions. Daniell states that a porous earthenware tube may be used instead of the ox gullet for practical ease but this arrangement will produce less power. Another suggestion made by Daniell to improve the cell was to replace the copper with platinum and copper sulfate with platinum chloride, but he remarks \\"such an arrangement would be perfect, but too costly for ordinary applications\\".John Frederic Daniell, An Introduction to the Study of Chemical Philosophy, pp. 504‚Äì505, John W. Parker, 1843 (pp. 438‚Äì439 in 1839 edition in which the comments about platinum do not appear). It is the porous pot form of the cell that came to be widely used in telegraphy. =Porous pot cell= Porous pot cell The porous pot cell consists of a central zinc anode dipped into a porous earthenware pot containing a zinc sulfate solution. The porous pot is, in turn, immersed in a solution of copper sulfate contained in a copper can, which acts as the cell's cathode. The use of a porous barrier allows ions to pass through but keeps the solutions from mixing. Without this barrier, when no current is drawn the copper ions will drift to the zinc anode and undergo reduction without producing a current, which will shorten the battery's life.Giorgio Carboni, Experiments in Electrochemistry; Last accessed on Jul 30, 2010. The replacement of sulfuric acid with zinc sulfate was the innovation of J. F. Fuller in 1853. It prolongs the life of the cell.Thomas Kingston Derry, Trevor Illtyd Williams, A Short History of Technology from the Earliest Times to A.D. 1900, p. 611, Courier Corporation, 1960 . Over time, copper buildup will block the pores in the earthenware barrier and cut short the battery's life. Nevertheless, the Daniell cell provides a longer and more reliable current than the Voltaic pile because the electrolyte deposited copper, which is a conductor, rather than hydrogen, which is an insulator, on the cathode. It is also safer and less corrosive. With an operating voltage of roughly 1.1 volts, it saw widespread use in telegraph networks until it was supplanted by the Leclanch√© cell in the late 1860s. =Gravity cell= Early 20th-century engraving of a gravity cell. Note the distinctive crowfoot shape of the zinc anode. Sometime during the 1860s, a Frenchman by the name of Callaud invented a variant of the Daniell cell which dispensed with the porous barrier. Instead, a layer of zinc sulfate sits on top of a layer of copper sulfate, the two liquids are kept separate by their differing densities, often with a layer of oil added on top to prevent evaporation. This reduces the internal resistance of the system and thus the battery yields a stronger current. This variant, called a gravity cell, consists of a glass jar in which a copper cathode sat on the bottom and a zinc anode is suspended beneath the rim in the zinc sulfate layer. Copper sulfate crystals are scattered around the cathode and the jar then filled with distilled water. As the current is drawn, a layer of zinc sulfate solution forms at the top around the anode. This top layer is kept separate from the bottom copper sulfate layer by its lower density and by the polarity of the cell. A disadvantage of the gravity cell is that a current has to be continually drawn to keep the two solutions from mixing by diffusion, so it is unsuitable for intermittent use. In addition, it was vulnerable to loss of integrity if too much electric current is drawn, which also causes the layers to mix. Sometimes called the crowfoot cell due to the distinctive shape of the electrodes, this arrangement is less costly for large multicell batteries and it quickly became the battery of choice for the American and British telegraph networks. Even after most telegraph lines started being powered by motor-generators, the gravity battery continued to be used in way stations to power the local circuit at least into the 1950s.Tools of Telegraphy , Telegraph Lore; Last accessed Jul 30, 2010 In the telegraph industry, this battery was often assembled on site by the telegraph workers themselves, and when it ran down it could be renewed by replacing the consumed components.Gregory S. Raven, Recollections of a Narrow Gauge Lightning Slinger ; Last accessed on Jul 30, 2010. The zinc sulfate layer is clear in contrast to the deep blue copper sulfate layer, which allows a technician to determine the battery life with a glance. On the other hand, this setup means the battery could only be used in a stationary appliance, otherwise the solutions would mix or spill. Use in electrometallurgy =Bird's cell= A variant of the Daniell cell was invented in 1837 by the Guy's hospital physician Golding Bird who used a plaster of Paris barrier to keep the solutions separate. Bird's experiments with this cell were of some importance to the new discipline of electrometallurgy, but Bird himself did not pursue this field; his interest was in electrotherapy. A surprising result from Bird's experiments was the deposition of copper on the porous plaster and in veins running through it without any contact with the metal electrodes. So surprising, in fact, that it was at first disbelieved by electrochemical investigators, including Michael Faraday. Bird himself had to carefully examine his apparatus for inadvertent contact, perhaps through the growth of copper \\"whiskers\\", before he was convinced of the result. Deposition of copper, and other metals, had been previously noted, but always previously it had been metal on metal electrode. Reprint of an 1889 volume.Golding Bird, Report of the Seventh Meeting of the British Society for the Advancement of Science, vol.6 (1837), p.45, London: J. Murray, 1838. =Electrotyping= John Dancer, a Liverpool instrument maker, in 1838 was the first to take commercial advantage of the unique features of the Daniell cell for copper plating. In a process now known as electrotyping he found he could make objects to any desired shape by using the porous barrier as a mould. Many others, however, had made the same discovery and in a patent dispute with Thomas Spencer it was pointed out that Bird had priority for the principle. Credit for invention of electrotyping is usually given to the Russian Moritz von Jacobi.

After five straight seasons of double-digit victories in minor league baseball, he was acquired by Washington in February 1943. As a rookie, he worked in 36 games, with 13 starts, and put up an 11‚Äì5 won‚Äìlost record and a 2.29 earned run average in 165 innings pitched. He was third in the Junior Circuit in ERA and fourth in winning percentage (.688), while the Senators ended up second in the league to the New York Yankees‚Äîalbeit by a distant, 13-game margin. His workload increased in , the first of three straight seasons in which he exceeded more than 225 innings pitched. In , knuckleball aces Haefner, Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling and Roger Wolff started 111 of the Senators' 154 games and accounted for 60 of the club's 87 victories, as Washington contended for the American League title up until the closing day of the season, before finishing 1 lengths behind the Detroit Tigers. Haefner went 16‚Äì14 (3.47) with 19 complete games and three saves. In , the first postwar season with many military veterans returning to major league service, Haefner continued his effective pitching, winning 14 games in 25 decisions and posting a 2.85 earned run average with 17 complete games. He won ten more games in before his performance declined to a poor 15‚Äì32 record over his final three MLB seasons.

A little over two months later, on July 21, the Senators sold his contract to the White Sox. In eight seasons and 261 career games pitched, Haefner compiled a 78‚Äì91 record with an earned run average of 3.50. He had 91 complete games, 13 shutouts and 13 saves.

The plague killed an estimated 75,000 to 100,000 people, around one quarter of the population, and is believed to have entered Athens through Piraeus, the city's port and sole source of food and supplies. Much of the eastern Mediterranean also saw an outbreak of the disease, albeit with less impact.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 2.48.1 The plague had serious effects on Athens' society, resulting in a lack of adherence to laws and religious belief; in response laws became stricter, resulting in the punishment of non-citizens claiming to be Athenian. In addition, Pericles, the leader of Athens, died from the plague.Plague in the Ancient World: A Study from Thucydides to Justinian by Christine A. Smith The plague returned twice more, in 429 BC and in the winter of 427/426 BC. Some 30 pathogens have been suggested as having caused the plague. Background Sparta and its allies, with the exception of Corinth, were almost exclusively land based powers, able to summon large land armies that were very nearly unbeatable. In the face of a combined campaign on land from Sparta and its allies beginning in 431 BC, the Athenians, under the direction of Pericles, pursued a policy of retreat within the city walls of Athens, relying on Athenian maritime supremacy for supply while the superior Athenian navy harassed Spartan troop movements. Unfortunately, the strategy also resulted in massive migration from the Attic countryside into an already highly populated city, generating overpopulation and resource shortage. Due to the close quarters and poor hygiene exhibited at that time, Athens became a breeding ground for disease and many citizens died. In the history of epidemics in war time, the 'Plague' of Athens is remarkable for the limitation of the affliction to one side as well as for its influence on the ultimate outcome of the war. In his History of the Peloponnesian War, the historian Thucydides, who was present and contracted the disease himself and survived,History of the Peloponnesian War 1.117 describes the epidemic. He writes of a disease coming from Ethiopia and passing through Egypt and Libya into the Greek world and spreading throughout the wider Mediterranean; a plague so severe and deadly that no one could recall anywhere its like, and physicians ignorant of its nature not only were helpless but themselves died the fastest, having had the most contact with the sick. In overcrowded Athens, the disease killed an estimated 25% of the population. The sight of the burning funeral pyres of Athens caused the Spartans to withdraw their troops, being unwilling to risk contact with the diseased enemy. Many of Athens' infantry and expert seamen died. According to Thucydides, not until 415 BC had Athens recovered sufficiently to mount a major offensive, the disastrous Sicilian Expedition. The first corroboration of the plague was not revealed until 1994-95 where excavation revealed the first mass grave. Upon this discovery, Thucydides' accounts of the event as well as analysis of the remains had been used to try and identify the cause of the epidemic. Social implications Accounts of the Athenian plague graphically describe the social consequences of an epidemic. Thucydides' account clearly details the complete disappearance of social morals during the time of the plague: The perceived impact of the Athenian plague on collective social and religious behavior echoes accounts of the medieval pandemic best known as the Black Death, although scholars have disputed its objective veracity in both instances, citing a historical link between epidemic disease and unsubstantiated moral panic that bordered on hysteria. =Fear of the law= Thucydides states that people ceased fearing the law since they felt they were already living under a death sentence. Likewise, people started spending money indiscriminately. Many felt they would not live long enough to enjoy the fruits of wise investment, while some of the poor unexpectedly became wealthy by inheriting the property of their relatives. It is also recorded that people refused to behave honorably because most did not expect to live long enough to enjoy a good reputation for it.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 2.53 =Care for the sick and dead= Œë reconstructed appearance of Myrtis, an 11-year-old girl who died during the plague of Athens and whose skeleton was found in the Kerameikos mass grave, National Archaeological Museum of Athens Another reason for the lack of honorable behavior was the sheer contagiousness of the illness. Those who tended to the ill were most vulnerable to catching the disease. This meant that many people died alone because no one was willing to risk caring for them. The dead were heaped on top of each other, left to rot, or shoved into mass graves. Sometimes those carrying the dead would come across an already burning funeral pyre, dump a new body on it, and walk away. Others appropriated prepared pyres so as to have enough fuel to cremate their own dead. Those lucky enough to survive the plague developed an immunity and so became the main caretakers of those who later fell ill.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 2.51 A mass grave and nearly 1,000 tombs, dated between 430 and 426 BC, have been found just outside Athens' ancient Kerameikos cemetery. The mass grave was bordered by a low wall that seems to have protected the cemetery from a wetland. Excavated during 1994‚Äì95, the shaft-shaped grave may have contained a total of 240 individuals, at least ten of them children. Skeletons in the graves were randomly placed with no layers of soil between them. Excavator Efi Baziotopoulou-Valavani, of the Third Ephoreia (Directorate) of Antiquities, reported that \\"[t]he mass grave did not have a monumental character. The offerings we found consisted of common, even cheap, burial vessels; black-finished ones, some small red-figured, as well as white lekythoi (oil flasks) of the second half of the 5th century BC. The bodies were placed in the pit within a day or two. These [factors] point to a mass burial in a state of panic, quite possibly due to a plague.\\" During this time refugees from the Peloponnesian war had immigrated within the Long Walls of Athens, inflating the populations of both the polis of Athens and the port of Piraeus. The population had tripled in this time increasing the chance of infection and worsening hygiene. =Religious strife= The plague also caused religious uncertainty and doubt. Since the disease struck without regard to a person's piety toward the gods, people felt abandoned by the gods and there seemed to be no benefit to worshiping them.Thuc. 2.53 The temples themselves were sites of great misery, as refugees from the Athenian countryside had been forced to find accommodation in the temples. Soon the sacred buildings were filled with the dead and dying. The Athenians pointed to the plague as evidence that the gods favored Sparta, and this was supported by an oracle that Apollo himself (the god of disease and medicine) would fight for Sparta if they fought with all their might. An earlier oracle had warned that \\"A Dorian [Spartan] war will come, and bring a pestilence with it\\".For both oracles, see Thuc. 2.54 Thucydides is skeptical of these conclusions and believes that people were simply being superstitious. He relies upon the prevailing medical theory of the day, Hippocratic theory, and strives to gather evidence through direct observation. He obsereved that carrion-eating birds and animals disappeared, though he leaves it an open question whether they died after eating the corpses or refused to eat them and were driven away: = Aftermath = The plague was an unforeseen event that resulted in one of the largest recorded loss of life in ancient Greece as well as a breakdown of Athenian society. The balance of power between citizens had changed due to many of the rich dying and their fortunes being inherited by remaining relatives of the lower class. According to Thucydides, those who had become ill and survived were the most sympathetic to others suffering: believing that they could no longer succumb to any illness, a number of survivors offered to assist with the remaining sick. The plague had also contributed to Athens' overall loss of power and ability to expand. Many of the remaining Athenians were found to be metics who had forged their documentation or had bribed officials to hide their original status. A number of these people were reduced to slaves once they were caught. This resulted in stricter laws dictating who can become an Athenian citizen, reducing both their number of potential soldiers and amount of political power, but also a decline in treatment and rights for metics in Athens. The plague dealt massive damage to Athens two years into the Peloponnesian War, from which it never recovered. Their political strength had weakened and morale among their armies as well as the citizens had fallen significantly. Athens would then go on to be defeated by Sparta and fall from being a major power in Ancient Greece.  Symptoms  According to Thucydides, the Plague of Athens, the illness began by showing symptoms in the head as it worked its way through the rest of the body. He also describes in detail the symptoms victims of the plague experienced. * Fever * Redness and inflammation in the eyes * Sore Throats leading to bleeding and bad breath * Sneezing * Loss of voice * Coughing * Vomiting * Pustules and ulcers on the body * Extreme thirst * Insomnia * Diarrhea Possible causes Historians have long tried to identify the disease behind the Plague of Athens. The disease has traditionally been considered an outbreak of the bubonic plague in its many forms, but reconsideration of the reported symptoms and epidemiology have led scholars to advance alternative explanations. These include typhus, smallpox, measles, and toxic shock syndrome.Dr. Alexander Langmuir, formerly chief epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, US. New England Journal of Medicine, 1985 Volume 313:1027‚Äì1030 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963885,00.html Based upon striking descriptive similarities with recent outbreaks in Africa, as well as the fact that the Athenian plague itself apparently came from Africa (as Thucydides recorded), Ebola or a related viral hemorrhagic fever has been considered.Olson PE, Hames CS, Benenson AS, Genovese EN. \\"The Thucydides syndrome: ebola deja vu? (or ebola reemergent?)\\" Emerging Infectious Diseases 2(1996): 155‚Äì156. . Given the possibility that profiles of a known disease may have changed over time, or that the plague was caused by a disease that no longer exists, the exact nature of the Athenian plague may never be known. In addition, crowding caused by the influx of refugees into the city led to inadequate food and water supplies and a probable proportionate increase in insects, lice, rats, and waste. These conditions would have encouraged more than one epidemic disease during the outbreak. =Typhus= In January 1999, the University of Maryland devoted their fifth annual medical conference, dedicated to notorious case histories, to the Plague of Athens. They concluded that the disease that killed the Greeks was typhus. \\"Epidemic typhus fever is the best explanation,\\" said Dr. David Durack, consulting professor of medicine at Duke University. \\"It hits hardest in times of war and privation, it has about 20 percent mortality, it kills the victim after about seven days, and it sometimes causes a striking complication: gangrene of the tips of the fingers and toes. The Plague of Athens had all these features.\\" In typhus cases, progressive dehydration, debilitation and cardiovascular collapse ultimately cause the patient's death. This medical opinion is supported by the opinion of A. W. Gomme, who wrote a comprehensive annotated edition of Thucydides and who also believed typhus was the cause of the epidemic. This opinion is expressed in his monumental work Historic Comments on Thucydides,Gomme, A. W., ed. A. Andrewes and K. J. Dover. An Historical Commentary on Thucydides, Volume 5. Book VIII, Oxford University Press, 1981. . completed after Gomme's death by A. Andrewes and K. J. Dover. Angelos Vlachos (), a member of the Academy of Athens and a diplomat, in his Remarks on Thucydides (, [1992] I: 177‚Äì178) acknowledges and supports Gomme's opinion: \\"Today, according to Gomme, it is generally acceptable that it was typhus\\" (\\"\\"). The theory has also found support recent in a study of the plague by Greek epidemiologists.Manolis J. Papagrigorakis, Christos Yapijakis, and Philippos N.Synodinos, ‚ÄòTyphoid Fever Epidemic in Ancient Athens,‚Äô in Didier Raoult, Michel Drancourt, Paleomicrobiology: Past Human Infections, Springer Science & Business Media, 2008 pp. 161‚Äì173. =Typhoid= Symptoms Symptoms generally associated with typhoid resemble Thucydides' description. They include: * a high fever from that rises slowly; * chills * bradycardia (slow heart rate) * weakness * diarrhea * headaches * myalgia (muscle pain) * lack of appetite * constipation * stomach pains * in some cases, a rash of flat, rose-colored spots called \\"rose spots\\" * extreme symptoms such as intestinal perforation or hemorrhage, delusions and confusion are also possible. Some characteristics of typhoid are at clear variance from Thucydides' description. Scavenger animals do not die from infection with typhoid,Thucydides equivocates on whether scavengers actually did die after eating corpses, or simply fled: See Thuc. 2.50. the onset of fever in typhoid is typically slow and subtle, and typhoid generally kills later in the disease course. As typhoid is most commonly transmitted through poor hygiene habits and public sanitation conditions in crowded urban areas, it is an unlikely cause of a plague emerging in the less urbanized Africa, as reported by Thucydides. DNA analysis A 2005 DNA study of dental pulp from teeth recovered from an ancient Greek burial pit, led by the orthodontist Dr. Manolis Papagrigorakis of the University of Athens, found DNA sequences similar to those of Salmonella enterica (S. enterica), the organism that causes typhoid fever. A second group of researchers, including American evolutionary molecular biologist Dr. Beth Shapiro of the University of California, Santa Cruz, disputed the Papagrigorakis team's findings, citing what they claim are serious methodological flaws. In a letter to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, Shapiro et al. stated that \\"while this DNA analysis confirms that the Athens sequence is possibly Salmonella, it demonstrates clearly that it is not typhoid.\\" The technique used by the Papagrigorakis team (PCR) has shown itself to be prone to contamination-induced false-positive results, and the source burial site is known to have been heavily trafficked in antiquity by hogs, carriers of another Salmonella serovar that may have been confused with the one that causes typhoid fever. Nonetheless, the Papagrigorakis team assert that the basis of this refutation is flimsy, and that the methodology used by the Shapiro team has historically produced conflicting results. =Viral hemorrhagic fever= Thucydides' narrative pointedly refers to increased risk among caregivers, more typical of the person-to-person contact spread of viral hemorrhagic fever (e.g., Ebola virus disease or Marburg virus) than typhus or typhoid. Unusual in the history of plagues during military operations, besieging Spartan troops are described as not having been afflicted by the illness raging near them within the city. Thucydides' description further invites comparison with VHF in the character and sequence of symptoms developed, and of the usual fatal outcome on about the eighth day. Some scientists have interpreted Thucydides' expression \\"\\" () as the unusual symptom of hiccups, They translate the phrase ŒªœçŒ≥Œæ Œ∫ŒµŒΩŒÆ as \\"hiccups,\\" often previously translated from Thucydides as \\"ineffectual retching\\", (cf. Aretaeus, Treatment of Acute Diseases 2.4; Hippocrates, Aphorisms 5.58). which is now recognized as a common finding in Ebola virus disease. Outbreaks of VHF in Africa in 2012 and 2014 reinforced observations of the increased hazard to caregivers and the necessity of barrier precautions for preventing disease spread related to grief rituals and funerary rites. The 2015 west African Ebola outbreak noted persistence of effects on genitalia and eyes in some survivors, both described by Thucydides. With an up to 21-day clinical incubation period, and up to 565-day infectious potential recently demonstrated in a semen-transmitted infection, movement of Ebola via Nile commerce into the busy port of Piraeus is plausible. Ancient Greek intimacy with African sources is reflected in accurate renditions of monkeys in art of frescoes and pottery, most notably guenons (Cercopithecus), the type of primates responsible for transmitting Marburg virus into Germany and Yugoslavia when that disease was first characterized in 1967. Circumstantially tantalizing is the requirement for the large quantity of ivory used in the Athenian sculptor Phidias‚Äô two monumental ivory and gold statues of Athena and of Zeus (one of the Seven Wonders), which were fabricated in the same decade. Never again in antiquity was ivory used on such a large scale. A second ancient narrative suggesting hemorrhagic fever etiology is that of Titus Lucretius Carus. Writing in the 1st century BC, Lucretius characterized the Athenian plague as having \\"bloody\\" or black discharges from bodily orifices. Lucretius cited and was an admirer of scientific predecessors in Greek Sicily Empedocles and Acron. While none of the original works of Acron, a physician, are extant, it is reported that he died c. 430 BC after travel to Athens to combat the plague. Unfortunately DNA sequence-based identification is limited by the inability of some important pathogens to leave a \\"footprint\\" retrievable from archaeological remains after several millennia. The lack of a durable signature by RNA viruses means some etiologies, notably the hemorrhagic fever viruses, are not testable hypotheses using currently available scientific techniques.

The main plotline was developed and expanded from the Red Dwarf episode of the same name, as well as the Series 3 and 4 episodes: White Hole, Marooned, Polymorph, and Backwards. The book, first published April 4 1991, is a sequel to Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers, and was the first Red Dwarf novel to receive its first print run in hardback edition. Like the first novel, Better Than Life became a best seller and was reproduced in paperback, omnibus and audiobook versions. Two further novels, Last Human and Backwards, were each created as alternate sequels by the writers, and followed in 1995 and 1996 respectively. Plot Following on from Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers, Lister, Rimmer and the Cat have discovered a cache of 'Better Than Life' headbands in one of the sleeping quarters. They fantasize that they board the Nova 5 and use its Duality Jump drive to return to Earth. The messages on his arm cause Lister to realize that he is in the game, and he confronts Rimmer. They travel to Denmark and meet with the Cat. While discussing how to get out, Kryten arrives and explains how they started playing, and to leave they need only want to leave, but their subsequent attempts to escape fail because the game lures them in. Their collective fantasies fall apart because of Rimmer's massive self-loathing; even if he wants to stay, he hates himself so much that his mind has only built up his life so that it can bring him down later. As a result, his company crashes, his new physical body is repossessed, and his attempt to escape leaves him trapped with a pair of violent criminals and transferred into the body of a female prostitute. Rimmer's escape damages the fantasies of the other three, forcing them all to depart. Once back in the real world, Rimmer and Kryten leave Lister and Cat in the infirmary to recuperate- the two near-starved and physically weak after almost two years of near-inactivity while in the Game- but learn that ship's computer Holly has shut himself down, as an experiment to cure his computer senility suggested by Talkie Toaster- a sentient Toaster with a fixation with doing its job- and restore his original IQ of 6 000 has given him an IQ of 12 000 at the cost of reducing his lifespan to a few minutes. With the ship now virtually powerless without Holly's control, it is discovered to be locked on course for a planet, but after attempts to manually restart the engines fail, Holly is able to use his remaining minutes of life to come up with a plan to knock the planet out of its orbit with an explosive. Holly's plan succeeds, but damage sustained to the Starbug shuttle causes Rimmer and Lister to crash-land on a drifting ice planet. Rimmer is returned to Red Dwarf when his remote projection unit runs out of power, but cannot send help for Lister as the ship has become trapped in the event horizon of a black hole. Back on the planet, Lister realises that he has arrived on Earth, which was sent drifting out of orbit after it became the solar system's garbage dump, Lister becoming the 'king' of the mutated giant cockroaches that are the planet's only remaining life. Back on the Dwarf, the crew are able to escape as Holly told the Toaster how to get out of a black hole before he shut himself down. Unfortunately, when the Dwarfers finally go to rescue Lister- with Rimmer and the Cat in one ship and Kryten and the Toaster in the other- Rimmer and the Cat are shocked to find a beautiful farm amidst the garbage, tended by an old Lister. Because of the time dilation of the black hole, thirty-four years have passed on the planet. A shape-shifting, emotion-stealing mutant known as a polymorph is able to sneak on board the ship, draining Lister of his fear, Cat of his confidence, Kryten of his guilt and Rimmer of his rage. Eventually the emotionally handicapped crew are able to defeat the Polymorph, but the abrupt restoration of his fear causes Lister to die of a heart attack. Rather than burying Lister, they take him to Universe 3, where time runs backwards. Lister returns to life on a version of Earth where time runs backwards. He recovers from his heart attack, regurgitates lunch, and is forced to take a wallet and watch from a mugger. A message from the Dwarf crew instructs Lister to meet them in thirty-six years (they can't stay with him or they would have gotten younger). Lister takes a taxi to his new home and finds an elderly Kochanski waiting for him. Lister is happy, knowing that he and Kochanski have many years behind them to look forward to. Differences between the novel and TV episode =The TV episode= We are first introduced to the game in a series two episode titled Better Than Life. The game arrives among other fantastic packages in a post pod, which is encountered after Red Dwarf turns around to head for home. It is part of a series of 'VR Total Immersion Video Games', which work by inserting electrodes into the user's frontal lobes and hypothalamus. The user becomes completely immersed within the reality of the game. Better Than Life is a game which allows the user to live out all their fantasies and desires. When in the game, one has the ability to mentally command into existence any object, person or environment. The problem with the game in the TV series, however, is that it also detects subconscious desires: if the user subconsciously hates himself then the game will eventually detect this and subject them to specifically tailored masochistic tortures. Total Immersion Video Games - though not specifically Better Than Life - are later encountered in the Series 5 episode 'Back to Reality', in which a group hallucination makes the Dwarf crew believe that the previous four years had been a video game fantasy. Another game in Series 7 allowed the crew to have tea with the characters of Pride And Prejudice, showing that not all of the Immersion games are dangerous: many of which are often played by Lister just to fulfill his sexual fantasies. =The novel= Better Than Life plays an important role in the two novels Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers and Red Dwarf: Better Than Life. The novel version of the game has far greater abilities and far greater bugs. Unlike the TV series, which is based on the original, nonaddictive version, and is only briefly mentioned in the novel, the novel version causes the user's imagination to develop semi-plausible explanations for certain events. For instance, in early versions of Better Than Life, the user could make a large, expensive car appear out of thin air. In the books, the user's imagination would create a scenario where they won the lottery, or created a successful business, so they could buy the car. The danger of the game is that once the user starts to play, the game forces them to forget they actually started to play, so they believe that they are still in reality. Their conscious mind only perceives the reality of the game, and all signals from their real body, except for those of extreme pain, are completely ignored. The game fulfils fantasies you don't even know you have. A person like the Cat, who has such a huge ego that he truly believes he deserves everything, will get everything he desires, regardless of how outlandish - he built himself a huge castle with a moat filled with milk, and surrounded himself with adoring Amazonian women who catered to his every desire. However a person like Rimmer, arrogant and filled with self-loathing, will build themselves up just to destroy themselves utterly, over and over again. Rimmer gave himself money, fame, and a stunningly beautiful wife - who was abusive and humiliatingly unfaithful. He then placed himself in a scenario where all his stocks abruptly crashed, he lost all of his money, his body was repossessed, and he was forced to occupy a female prostitute's body, then dragged into hiding from the law, experiencing verbal, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of violent criminals, and finally pimped out by them, as well as coming to realise that his idea of the perfect woman - the woman he was in fact engaged to - was the spitting image of his own mother. Lister on the other hand had a fantasy far more mature and healthy than those of the others, just needing somebody he loved who would love him in return and the ability to live quietly but comfortably. Unfortunately Rimmer's presence in the game even resulted in his and the Cat's fantasies being crushed, giving them no reason to stay. The game can even trap mechanoids by playing on their desire for devoted servitude. While Kryten didn't forget that he was playing the game, he kept finding himself distracted when the game continually offered him the exact chores that he had been created to carry out. In a shared game, a player cannot leave unless all the players agree to leave. Unless cared for in the real world, a user (or \\"Game Head\\") dies very quickly. While it is certainly possible for friends to forcibly remove the headset that contains the game, this results in instant death from shock. The only way to exit the game is to figure out that you're playing the game, develop the desire to leave it and then command an exit - followed by the final level, which involves the player believing that they have woken up, and requires them to realise that this is also artificial because, again, it is Better Than Life.

Life and career She was born in Everett, Washington, the daughter of Vivian R. (Hester) and Everett Emery. Her family was Baptist and of Swedish, Irish, and English descent. She met Bruce Lee while she was attending Garfield High School, where Bruce came to give a kung fu demonstration; he was attending the University of Washington at the time. Eventually, she became one of his kung fu students when she was attending the University of Washington, studying to become a teacher. She took lessons from Lee while attending college. They married on August 17, 1964. Linda was a few credits short from graduation. They had two children, Brandon Lee and Shannon Lee. Bruce Lee had opened his own kung fu school at the time and was teaching Wing Chun, which would later serve as the basis for Jeet Kune Do.

He was a member of the 17th Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China's highest decision-making body, and the Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (Zhengfawei) between 2007 and 2012, making him one of the most powerful leaders in China. In that position, Zhou oversaw China's security apparatus and law enforcement institutions, with power stretching into courts, prosecution agencies, police forces, paramilitary forces, and intelligence organs. He was convicted of corruption-related charges in 2014 and expelled from the CPC. Zhou rose through the ranks of the Communist Party through his involvement in the oil and gas industry, starting as a technician on the Daqing oil field during the Cultural Revolution. He was at the helm of the China National Petroleum Corporation between 1996 and 1998, then became Minister of Land and Natural Resources until 1999, and subsequently Party Secretary of Sichuan, then China's second most populous province. Zhou was a State Councilor of the State Council from 2003 to 2008 and also a member of the Party Secretariat of the Central Committee. He served as the Minister of Public Security from 2002‚Äì07, before being promoted to the PSC. Zhou retired at the 18th Party Congress in 2012. In late 2013, Zhou was placed under investigation for alleged abuse of power and corruption, a decision state media announced in July 2014.Zhou Yongkang investigated for serious disciplinary violation. Xinhua News Agency (July 29, 2014). Retrieved July 29, 2014. Zhou was the first Politburo Standing Committee member ‚Äì and the most senior-ranked official ‚Äì since the founding of the People's Republic of China to be tried and convicted of corruption-related charges. Following his investigation, Zhou was expelled from the Chinese Communist Party. On June 11, 2015, Zhou was convicted of bribery, abuse of power and the intentional disclosure of state secrets by the Intermediate Court in Tianjin. Zhou and his family members were said to have taken 129 million yuan (over $20 million) in bribes. He was sentenced to life in prison. Early life Born Zhou Yuangen () in December 1942, Zhou is a native of Xiqiantou Village (Ë•øÂâçÂ§¥Êùë), Wuxi County, in Jiangsu province. Xiqiantou is located outside Wuxi city proper. The majority of Xiqiantou residents were surnamed \\"Zhou\\". Zhou took on the surname of his mother because his father, whose surname was Lu, was a 'live-in son-in-law' of his maternal grandparents. Upon joining the Zhou household when he married, Zhou Yongkang's father took on his wife's surname and became known as Zhou Yisheng (Âë®‰πâÁîü). Zhou was the eldest of three sons. Zhou's family was poor; his family made a living farming and fishing the Asian swamp eel. Zhou was sent to school with the financial assistance of his family friends. In 1954, Zhou was enrolled at one of the two top middle schools in the eastern Wuxi area. It was during this period that Zhou changed his name to \\"Yongkang\\" on the advice of his teacher, because there was another person in his class with an identical name. Zhou excelled at school, and was eventually accepted to enroll at the prestigious Suzhou High School, one of the most prominent secondary schools in the Jiangnan region. Zhou had good grades and was involved in extra-curricular activities, including the school's political ideology group as well as the events promoting literacy. In 1961, after obtaining stellar results on his Gaokao exams, he was admitted to the Beijing Institute of Petroleum (now China University of Petroleum) soon after, and became the pride of his village. He majored in geophysical survey and exploration. In November 1964 Zhou became a member of the Chinese Communist Party. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution ensnared Beijing's higher education institutions. Zhou was told by the authorities to \\"wait for an assignment\\" while the political struggles wreaked havoc on China's universities. He waited for a year. He joined geological survey work in north-east China in 1967, assigned to become an intern technician at factory No. 673 at the Daqing oil field. In 1970, Zhou was promoted to lead the geological survey division of a local department charged with carrying out an ambitious petroleum drilling initiative set out by the Party's top leadership.  Career  = Oil exploration in Liaoning = In 1973, Zhou Yongkang was promoted to head the Geophysical Exploration Department of the Liaohe Petroleum Exploration Bureau, located in Panjin, Liaoning. Liaohe would eventually become one of the China National Petroleum Corporation's (CNPC) largest oil fields. Zhou was seen as a hard-working and emotionally mature presence to his colleagues; he did not drink or smoke, and would rarely speak based on script. He would reputedly talk unscripted for hours on end while keeping his colleagues engaged. At Liaohe, Zhou met Wang Shuhua (), a factory worker from Hebei province, whom he later married. As the Liaohe exploration team grew, Zhou eventually became responsible for over 2,300 employees in his department. His work consisted mainly of leading teams to unexplored, barren territory to conduct site surveys to assess the potential for future oil drilling. He was known to be great at maintaining good interpersonal relationships with his superiors and subordinates, and gained significant personal clout. During some years, Zhou did not go back to his home in Jiangsu even during the Chinese New Year holiday period, which is a time traditionally reserved for family reunions. Instead, Zhou would visit his colleagues who were working in harsh winter conditions in remote areas. Beginning in the 1970s, Zhou would gain rapid career advancement. He owed much of his career growth to his mentors from the Beijing Institute of Petroleum, who were working in executive positions at the Liaohe oil fields at the time. In particular the university's president was known to be fond of Zhou's skills and was eager to promote him. In 1983, with the director of the Liaohe Oil Field Management Bureau being transferred for a job in Beijing, Zhou was promoted to manage day-to-day affairs of the oil field. Moreover, given the oil field's prominence in the municipal affairs of the city of Panjin, Zhou became concurrently the Mayor of Panjin and the city's deputy party secretary. Zhou's stint as mayor was his first major role in government. =National oil sector= In 1985, Zhou Yongkang left Liaoning for Beijing to become the Deputy Minister of Petroleum Industry. In 1988, the ministry later folded and became a state-owned enterprise, the predecessor of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China's largest energy company. Zhou became a member of the company's senior executive team and was named deputy general manager. In March 1989, as part of the government's overall strategy to move oil production from east to west, Zhou led an oil and gas exploration and survey team to begin work in the Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang region of far- west China, near the city of Korla. In the mid-1990s, Zhou spearheaded CNPC's \\"go global\\" initiatives, winning bids for large projects in Sudan, Venezuela, and Kazakhstan. Zhou was particularly involved in the Sudan Nile petroleum project, including the construction of the Greater Nile Oil Pipeline, CNPC's first major project outside of China. Zhou travelled to the African country 14 times. Beginning in 1996, Zhou became general manager (chief executive) of the CNPC.Hu Jintao, China who's who, who's who in china, China's Celebrities, Famous Chinese. China Today. Retrieved March 30, 2012. As chief executive, Zhou was instrumental in the company's restructuring and the preparation the initial public offering of the company's subsidiary PetroChina. In October 1997, Zhou gained a seat on the Central Committee of the Communist Party, a leadership assembly of some 200 top political figures of the party. In March 1998, Zhou was elevated to become Minister of Land and Resources in Premier Zhu Rongji's cabinet. The \\"mega-ministry\\" was created after a merger of the formerly separate Ministry of Geology and Mining, Administration of National Land, National Administration of Oceans, and the National Surveying and Mapping Bureau. As minister, Zhou, upon finding that his staff did not have adequate housing, initiated a housing construction program for the department's engineers and senior technical staff. = Leading Sichuan = In 1999, Zhou became Party Secretary of Sichuan, the province's top political office. Sichuan was China's second most populous province at the time. Prior to Zhou, most of Sichuan's provincial leaders originated from the province. Zhou, an outsider, brought change to the province's political landscape. He spearheaded economic modernization policies and in particular focused on agricultural modernization. Sichuan was known to be a province highly dependent on agriculture, and its government operated at a slower pace compared to those of China's coastal regions. Zhou was known for his quick and efficient decision-making, significantly altering the traditionally lax culture of the province's civil service. During Zhou's tenure in Sichuan, the province's GDP grew at an average rate of 9.5% a year. One of his major achievements was securing investment from large multinationals such as Intel. The company opened a new computer chip factory near Chengdu shortly after Zhou left his post in Sichuan. He also focused on improving tourism resources, significantly revamping the Mount Emei scenic region to attract more visitors. Zhou also improved public safety in the province, for example enacting policies that aimed to reduce accidents in the province's water lanes. On October 20, 2000, in the spirit of attracting investment for economic development, Zhou hosted visiting Chinese and international dignitaries and businesspeople at the China Western Forum held in Chengdu.The event was noted for being a gathering of Sichuan's political and business elite at the time. Those on the guest list included Deng Hong, Li Chongxi, Ji Wenlin, Guo Yongxiang, He Huazhang, Tan Li, and Li Chuncheng. All were detained for investigation or charged with corruption related crimes fourteen years later. While in Sichuan, he gained a reputation for dealing firmly with any signs of dissent ‚Äì coming down hard on Tibetan groups and Falun Gong. Although Zhou left Sichuan to take up national leadership positions in Beijing in 2002, he cultivated a strong power base of patronage. The elite provincial political circles were stacked with Zhou allies, the most notable being deputy provincial party chief Li Chongxi, Chengdu party boss Li Chuncheng, and chief administrator Guo Yongxiang. Indeed, Zhou's network of patronage in Sichuan remained a highly influential force in provincial politics until the anti- corruption campaign of 2013, which saw all of Zhou's proteges fall from grace. = Minister of Public Security = Zhou's political fate was subject to rife speculation in the lead-up to the 16th Party Congress held in the fall of 2002. Widely regarded as a rising political star, Zhou was said to be a leading candidate for Vice-Premier or entry into the top ranks of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (Zhengfawei). The central government was also in need of a tough and uncompromising figure to take reins of China's security system in the post-9/11 global security paradigm. With his quasi- military style training in the oil sector and a reputation for being able to make tough decisions, Zhou got the nod to become Minister of Public Security in December 2002. He also earned a series of powerful posts in the party and government within the span of a few months, including membership in the Politburo, State Councilor, Deputy Zhengfawei Secretary, First Political Commissar of the People's Armed Police (China's paramilitary police force), and Secretary of the party's Central Secretariat (the party's internal policy execution and coordination body). Zhou's assuming the deputy secretary position at the Zhengfawei meant that his status in the Chinese domestic security system was second only to Politburo Standing Committee member Luo Gan. Zhou was the first Minister of Public Security to hold a Politburo seat since Mao's successor Hua Guofeng, a testament to the renewed importance of the domestic security portfolio. This was partially attributed to the increasingly sharp social conflict in China as a result of the wealth imbalance created by the post-Mao era economic reform policies. At the turn of the century, \\"mass incidents\\" - a catch-all euphemism that could refer to any organized or spontaneous protests of social, political, economic, or religious nature - had become commonplace across the country. In response, Beijing mandated sweeping structural reforms that significantly elevated the status of Public Security organs across the country. Somewhat emulating Zhou's concurrently holding party and government posts in addition to his role as Minister of Public Security, the reforms carried out during Zhou's tenure called for provincial and local police chiefs (i.e., heads of Public Security organs) to also hold membership in local party leadership councils as well as leading government posts, and, more importantly, hold a leading post in the Zhengfawei. The intent of the reforms were to make decisions about policing, investigations, and the court system more efficient in an era of more pronounced social conflict. However, in practice the reforms gave party and government policy makers, who were not constitutionally empowered to serve day-to-day executive duties, an avenue to directly intervene in domestic security concerns, such as using force to crack down on \\"mass incidents\\". In addition, that the Zhengfawei, which normally oversaw government policy in the courts, prosecution agencies, criminal legislation, paramilitary forces, and internal intelligence services, had combined jurisdiction over executive police organs meant that Zhengfawei chiefs held immense and largely unchecked legislative, executive, and judicial power. As Minister of Public Security, Zhou was seen as China's \\"national police chief\\". He undertook significant reforms of the country's policing system, which not only faced external pressures from a deteriorating domestic security situation, but also internal dissent due to stagnant wages and lack of resources. Zhou set out mandating the construction of new office buildings to serve as police headquarters, provided modern housing for officers. He also implemented a wide array of disciplinary regulations, including making offenses such as using firearms outside of work duties, drinking and driving, and gambling during work hours causes for dismissal. He was also said to have fired several hundred police officers for drinking problems.BBC: China's New Leaders. BBC News. Retrieved March 30, 2012. Zhou held high-profile \\"mass study sessions\\" in an attempt to indoctrinate officers politically on party policies. He also instituted a nationwide \\"professional training boot camp\\" intended to streamline police operations and teach officers about professional ethics, making it mandatory for rank-and-file officers to take \\"professional training\\" for half of their working day. Zhou also began a national campaign for xinfang petitioners to \\"speak directly with the police chief\\", aimed at creating a more effective means to address petitioner grievances. As part of this campaign, the number of petitions and their response rates were tied to financial and career advancement consequences for local officials. As a result, many local authorities hired thugs and private security firms to detain, harass, beat, or otherwise discourage petitioners from filing their grievances. It spawned an entire industry of private security firms specializing in petitioners, as well as an increase in the number of extrajudicial detention centres known as \\"black jails\\". With increased resources at the disposal of police departments and a higher concentration of power, law enforcement agencies often found itself at odds with public interest; public trust in domestic security organs eroded. =Politburo Standing Committee= Zhou's time as the top official in Sichuan, the oil sector, and Public Security Minister earned him significant leadership experience and personal clout, as well as a complex network of patronage. In 2007, Zhou was transferred to fill the vacancy from Luo Gan, who retired from his leadership position as central Zhengfawei chief. With this powerful position, Zhou also gained a spot on the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest council of Communist Party rulers. With the expansion of Zhengfawei authority in the preceding years, Zhou became the top official responsible for China's courts, law enforcement, prosecution agencies, paramilitary forces, and domestic intelligence agencies. Even though he was ranked ninth in the party leadership hierarchy, Zhou, dubbed China's \\"security tsar\\" by select English-language media, emerged as one of the Standing Committee's most important members, and one of China's most powerful men. In his position as national Zhengfawei chief, Zhou oversaw extensive security preparations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the 60th anniversary celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 2009, and Expo 2010 in Shanghai. At around this time, \\"weiwen\\" (Áª¥Á®≥; roughly, \\"protecting stability\\") became a top political priority of the Chinese government. Zhou headed the national weiwen task force, overseeing law enforcement, suppression of dissent, state surveillance, and combating separatist movements in Xinjiang and Tibet. By 2011, during the unfolding of Arab Spring and the subsequent \\"Jasmine Revolution\\" movement, the national weiwen budget, valued at 624.4 billion yuan (US$95 billion), had exceeded the military budget for the first time in history. On February 20, 2011, Zhou said to assembled officials at a national security conference that law enforcement must \\"put together a comprehensive system to prevent disturbance and control social order, so that conflict can be resolved at the embryonic stage.\\" In that year, some 130,000 \\"mass incidents\\" of protest and violence were reported around the country, mostly caused by official corruption, environmental degradation, and social security issues. Incidences of police brutality increased, and in many cases police involvement in popular protests exacerbated underlying problems and led to further violence. Towards the end of his term, Zhou presided over a national security & law enforcement system that operated with no meaningful external oversight and operating independently from government organs and the party's collective leadership. As a result of his vast state security \\"empire\\" as well as strong remnants of his influence in the national oil sector and Sichuan, Zhou was ranked 29th in the 2011 Forbes list of the world's most powerful people. Chinese rights activists, such as members of the Weiquan movement, were especially critical of Zhou's tenure as China's security chief. Civil rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang criticized Zhou in a public lecture at Hong Kong University in December 2011. Two years later, Pu wrote on his microblog that Zhou \\"brought great disaster and inflicted great suffering on the country and its people.\\"The original in Chinese was the idiomatic phrase \\"Á•∏ÂõΩÊÆÉÊ∞ë„ÄÅËçºÊØíÂ§©‰∏ã\\" Pu wrote that the weiwen policies spearheaded by Zhou had severely undermined progress in the protection of human rights and rule of law, led to unprecedented levels of popular distrust of government authority, expanded the realm of party control in the lives of ordinary citizens, and ran counter to the spirit of the \\"Harmonious Society\\" ideology of the Hu-Wen administration. Former State Council functionary Yu Meisun (‰øûÊ¢ÖËç™) said that Zhou's ten years in power were the \\"ten darkest years for law and order in history [...] a severe reversal of progress.\\" Zhou (right) listens to American Admiral Thad Allen during a 2006 trip to the United States Several leaked U.S. diplomatic cables from Wikileaks have alleged Zhou's involvement in Beijing's cyber attack against Google, though the claim's veracity has been questioned. Other cables said it was \\"well-known\\" that Zhou Yongkang controlled the state monopoly of the oil sector. Zhou also served as China's 'high representative' in matters relating to North Korea, attending the Arirang Festival as a guest of Kim Jong-il before Kim died in 2011. =Aftermath of Bo Xilai's ouster= In February 2012, former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun made an abrupt and unexpected visit to the United States consulate in the city of Chengdu. The event set off a political storm which eventually resulted in the ouster of Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai. Bo, considered a political ally of Zhou, was rumoured to be next-in-line to Zhou's powerful position of Legal and Political Committee (Zhengfawei) Secretary, and thus the Standing Committee. Zhou had a close relationship with Bo, and he was reportedly acquainted with Wang Lijun as far back as his early days as mayor of Panjin. On Zhou's 2010 visit to Chongqing, he publicly endorsed Bo's \\"Red Songs\\" and \\"Strike Black\\" campaigns (), showing enthusiasm for the so-called \\"Chongqing model\\" unmatched by his other Standing Committee colleagues. Zhou lauded Bo's heavy-handed approach to reduce crime in the city, and praised Bo's style of state-driven, populist \\"mass movements\\" which had some characteristics of a Maoist-style political campaign. In March, the Standing Committee moved to remove Bo from his positions as a result of Bo being implicated in the Wang Lijun scandal, a decision which Zhou alone was said to have resisted. In the days following Bo Xilai's fall, rumours circulated about Zhou's break with the party leadership as well as a \\"coup d'etat\\" on March 19. Unconfirmed reports surfaced on the U.K.-based Sunday Times, citing Hong Kong magazine Frontline (), that the paramilitary forces under Zhou's disposal had narrowly avoided direct conflict with the 38th Army in the center of Beijing.Due to the opaqueness of machinations of China's political elites, numerous conspiracy theories emerged on what really happened in Beijing on the night of March 19 in what became known as the \\"March 19 Beijing coup\\". A widely circulated theory from Chinese- language news portal Boxun alleged that Zhou dispatched paramilitary troops in an attempt to free former Dalian Shide executive chairman Xu Ming, and ally of Bo Xilai, from custody, so as to prevent Xu from testifying at Bo's trial. Another more elaborate theory by New York-based Mingjing News stated that Zhou Yongkang planned to launch a coup on the night of March 19, and that Hu Jintao dispatched the 38th Army into Beijing in order to protect the Zhongnanhai compound from incursions by Zhou's \\"coup militia\\". This theory posits that paramilitary forces stormed Xinhua Gate and were repelled by the 38th Army in a stand off during which gunshots were fired into the air. Thereafter Hu Jintao received a phone call from former leader Jiang Zemin, who told Hu that Zhou had no intentions of launching a coup, which de-escalated the situation. None of these theories have been independently verified, nor reported on by mainstream English-language news sources. Outwardly, Zhou appeared to be toeing the party line between March 2012 and his scheduled retirement in November. For example, several days after Bo Xilai was suspended from the Politburo, Zhou held a national conference call with police officials, publicly declaring, \\"police officers must [...] understand what political position they need to take, maintain the correct political course, and always remain in line with the party centre led by comrade Hu Jintao as its General Secretary.\\" On May 14, 2012, the Financial Times reported that Zhou had relinquished the operational control of the party's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission to Minister of Public Security Meng Jianzhu due to his support for Bo Xilai, and had lost his right to select his successor when he retires from the Politburo Standing Committee in the fall of 2012.\\"Bo ally gives up China security roles\\", Jamil Anderlini, Financial Times, May 14, 2012. The New York Times later reported that Zhou's status remained unchanged.\\"China Security Chief Seems to Keep His Hold on Power\\", Edward Wong, The New York Times, May 19, 2012. At around the same time, a group of provincial party veterans from Yunnan province penned an open letter to Hu Jintao calling for the removal of Zhou Yongkang due to his support of Bo Xilai. The veterans voiced concerns that those supporting Bo intended to reinstate Mao-style policies in China. Zhou Yongkang retired from Politburo Standing Committee after the 18th Party Congress on 15 November, 2012, and retired from Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission 5 days later, which Meng Jianzhu succeed Zhou‚Äôs position. Downfall Map of Zhou Yongkang's relationship network Zhou retired at the 18th Party Congress held in November 2012, an event which saw Xi Jinping ascend to become General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, China's top leader. In a significant change to China's top ruling council, Zhou's Political and Legal Affairs Commission portfolio did not feature in the new Standing Committee at all; instead, the Committee had shrunk to its pre-2002 size of seven instead of nine members. This was followed by wide-ranging reforms to local Zhengfawei organs. For example, the practice of lower-level Zhengfawei chiefs concurrently holding the office of police chief (i.e. Public Security) and concurrent government posts was gradually phased out, and the Zhengfawei was discouraged from directly interfering with on-going investigations or cases. These reforms signaled a reduction in the executive authority of Zhengfawei chiefs in favour of better checks and balances in the legal system, and a restoration of the Zhengfawei in a policy oversight role rather than being an executive organ, which had been the case under Zhou. In 2013, Zhou appeared in public three times. He visited his alma maters, Suzhou High School and the China University of Petroleum in April and October, respectively; on June 23, Zhou visited the Zibo, Shandong-based Qilu Petrochemicals Company (), a subsidiary of Sinopec. His visit to Suzhou High School also marked his final pilgrimage to his hometown. During this visit, Zhou suggested that it might be his last visit home. At his visit to the China University of Petroleum campus, Zhou publicly 'pledged his allegiance' to Xi Jinping, China's new leader, rallying students to unite behind Xi to pursue the \\"Chinese Dream\\". =Consensus among party leaders= The new party leadership under Xi reportedly began planning the crackdown on Zhou beginning in 2012. Xi's 'tough talk' on corruption began immediately after his ascension to the post of General Secretary. In his first days in office, Xi vowed to crack down on \\"tigers and flies\\", meaning extremely powerful officials as well as petty ones. Xi moved quickly to set a new standard for expected behavior of party officials, issuing a series of guidelines to clean up the party bureaucracy. Xi may have also been concerned that Zhou might use his influence and power to turn various state security entities into tools for advancing his interests, and in the process undermine the central authority of the state. Discussions surrounding the Zhou case took place in the summer of 2013. In June, the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party held a four-day-long conference in Beijing specifically to discuss Zhou Yongkang. During the meeting the members of China's ruling council reportedly exchanged differing viewpoints on Zhou. Eventually Xi Jinping and the other six members of the newly formed 18th Politburo Standing Committee came to consensus to investigate Zhou. Zhou's case was unprecedented, as no corruption investigation had ever been initiated against a member of the elite Politburo Standing Committee. The last PSC member to be ousted politically was Zhao Ziyang in the aftermath of Tiananmen in 1989, and the last PSC members to be put on trial were those of the Gang of Four following the Cultural Revolution. Owing to the far-reaching impact Zhou's case would have on the party as well as the potential for intra-party conflict, Xi also reportedly sought the blessing of former General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao as well as other 'party elders'. Jiang was said to have met with Xi several times in Beijing between June and July to discuss Zhou Yongkang. During these meetings, Xi was said to have directly elaborated to Jiang on Zhou's alleged crimes, as well as convincing Jiang of the potential harm to the party and the state if Zhou were not brought down. Jiang, though initially reluctant, eventually threw his weight behind Xi. Jiang subsequently applauded Xi's leadership skills during a visit by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Hu Jintao was reportedly fully supportive of investigating Zhou prior to the power transition to Xi Jinping at the 18th Party Congress. Zhou himself reportedly sought two audiences with Xi, during which he discussed his contributions to the country and attempted to plead clemency, to no avail. = Investigation = In August 2013, the Party began a corruption investigation into Zhou. A number of Zhou's former subordinates who were then in high-ranking positions were sacked in quick succession. These included Li Chuncheng, a former deputy party secretary in Sichuan; Jiang Jiemin, former chief executive of China Petroleum; Li Dongsheng, former deputy minister of Public Security; Ji Wenlin, Mayor of Haikou and Zhou's former secretary; and Li Chongxi, a high-ranking official in Sichuan province. His former secretaries (i.e., directors of his office, chief of staff) Li Hualin, Shen Dingcheng, and Guo Yongxiang were all detained. In December, Zhou, his son Zhou Bin and his daughter-in-law Huang Wan were taken into custody. The home of Zhou's younger brother Zhou Yuanxing () was searched by the authorities twice. Yuanxing died in December 2013 after a battle with cancer. Zhou Yongkang and his son Zhou Bin were not present at the funeral, fuelling speculation that Zhou and his family members were all in custody. Zhou's family reportedly made billions of dollars by investing in the oil industry, of which Zhou had headed the largest company, China National Petroleum Corp. According to the Hong Kong-based Apple Daily, Zhou's eldest son made more than US$1.6 billion from public works in the city of Chongqing alone. He also supposedly used his father's prominence to extort millions of dollars in protection fees from various businesses and organizations. Zhou was reportedly being held in confinement without visitation rights in a heavily guarded facility on a military base near Baotou, Inner Mongolia. By March 2014, Chinese authorities were reported to have seized assets worth at least 90 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) from Zhou's family members and associates. By Spring 2014, it became increasingly clear that Zhou's spheres of influence - the oil sector, Sichuan, the legal system, and his family members - were being methodically rounded up for investigation. However, in the absence of any official reports on Zhou himself, Chinese and international media became rife with speculation about his fate. At a press conference during the March 2014 national meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a reporter from Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post directly asked the spokesperson if he could provide more information on the rumours circulating about the Zhou Yongkang case. In response, the spokesman chuckled and said, \\"like you, I've seen some stories on a select few media outlets,\\" he then recited a prepared party-line reply, then ended off his response with a smile, \\"this is really all I can say in response to your question, I think you know what I mean.\\" ()The spokesman was referring to the unspoken rule that the authorities cannot confirm or deny any facts related to any party investigation before an official announcement was made. Indeed, in his response, he did not even utter Zhou's name. The phrase ni dongde (‰Ω†ÊáÇÁöÑ) became so popular after its use by the spokesman that it was regularly used on social media websites as a placeholder for Zhou Yongkang himself, whose name was still routinely censored at the time. To evade censorship, other names used for Zhou included \\"Master Kang\\" (Â∫∑Â∏àÂÇÖ), from the instant noodles brand which shares the Chinese character \\"Kang\\", \\"Big Tiger\\" (Â§ßËÄÅËôé), \\"Old Tiger\\" (ËÄÅËÄÅËôé), and \\"Zhou Tiger\\" (Âë®ËÄÅËôé). Afterwards the assembled press gallery burst into laughter. =Arrest and expulsion from the party= On July 29, 2014, state media formally announced an internal party investigation against Zhou Yongkang's \\"violations of party discipline\\", but did not mention any criminal wrongdoing. Several months later, the party investigation concluded that Zhou abused his power for the illicit gain of his family, friends, and associates, took \\"large amounts in bribes personally and through his family and associates; abused his power to further the interests of his family, mistresses, and associates; committed adultery with multiple women and engaged in the exchange of money and favours for sex; and leaked state and party secrets.\\" State media announced Zhou's arrest to face criminal proceedings on December 5, 2014. He was expelled from the Chinese Communist Party. Zhou was the first Politburo Standing Committee member to be expelled from the party since the fall of the Gang of Four in 1980The last Politburo Standing Committee members expelled from the Communist Party of China were members of the Gang of Four, Zhang Chunqiao and Wang Hongwen, following their trials in 1980. It is worth noting that Zhao Ziyang, PSC member at the time of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 who opposed martial law, and the last PSC member before Zhou to have fallen out of political favour, was never expelled from the party. at the conclusion of the Cultural Revolution. After the announcement of Zhou's expulsion from the party, the party's official newspaper People's Daily editorialized that Zhou's expulsion was part of the \\"strong resolve\\" to stamp out corruption in the party by General Secretary Xi Jinping. The editorial said the case demonstrated that the party saw \\"everyone as equal in the eyes of the law.\\" It said that Zhou \\"betrayed the essence and mission of the party\\" and that \\"corruption in the party is like fire and water.\\" Media outlets outside of mainland China speculated about the political reasons behind Zhou's downfall. The Economist compared Zhou's fall with earlier internecine struggles in the party and noted Xi's anti-corruption campaign had \\"apparent factional bias\\", quoting a study that no \\"Princelings\\" have been investigated in the anti-corruption campaign. He Pin (‰ΩïÈ¢ë), the chief editor of the overseas Chinese news portal Mingjing, went one step further and asserted plainly that Zhou fell because he was engaged in a political conspiracy to depose Xi Jinping.According to He, Zhou had formed a \\"New Gang of Four\\" with Bo Xilai, disgraced general Xu Caihou, and former General Office chief Ling Jihua, a modern incarnation of the so-called \\"counter-revolutionary clique\\" whose real crime was deviating from the party line and \\"standing on the wrong side\\". He compared Zhou to losers of historical power struggles in the party, including Gao Gang, Rao Shushi, Liu Shaoqi, Lin Biao, the Gang of Four, Hu Yaobang, and Zhao Ziyang, and asserted that out of these cases only Zhou had truly engaged in forming a political clique to commit a conspiracy against the party's leaders. These assertions have not been independently verified. In contrast, The New York Times did not speculate on political reasons behind Zhou's arrest, simply writing that ordinary Chinese people may be alarmed that the legal system was once under the hands of a deeply corrupt politician. Duowei Times expressed disappointment with mainstream Western media characterization of the event as \\"yet another political purge\\", asserting that seeing modern China, particularly the post-Xi Communist Party, as rife with political intrigue and full of backroom deals is imprecise and naive. Duowei stated that Western media had a very poor grasp of what Xi was actually trying to achieve, and that Zhou's downfall was but a small element of a larger campaign by Xi Jinping to clean up the party, institutionalize power structures, and re-build the party's legitimacy. According to The New Yorker profile of Xi, \\"corruption had become so threatening to the Party‚Äôs legitimacy that only the most isolated leader could have avoided forcing it back to a more manageable level, but railing against corruption was also a proven instrument for political consolidation, and at the highest levels Xi has deployed it largely against his opponents. Geremie Barme, the historian who heads the Australian Centre on China in the World, analyzed the forty- eight most high-profile arrests, and discovered that none of them were second- generation reds.\\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red =Trial and sentencing= In the days leading up to the anticipated trial, Supreme Court President Zhou Qiang (no relation) told an assembled international press conference that Zhou Yongkang's trial would be \\"open and in accordance with the law.\\" In April 2015, Zhou Yongkang was formally charged with abuse of power, bribery, and intentionally leaking state secrets, and scheduled to face trial at the Tianjin First Intermediate People's Court. Overseas Chinese media was rife with speculation about the 'treatment' Zhou was to receive. However, Zhou's trial unexpectedly took place behind closed doors. On June 11, state media made an announcement - without any apparent warning - that Zhou's verdict had already been reached. The official report on Zhou's trial was brief, and stated that he had been convicted on all three charges. The legal sentence, according to the state, was life in prison for bribery, seven years for abuse of power, and four years for \\"leaking state secrets.\\" The court decided that Zhou could serve prison terms concurrently and amalgamated the sentences into one 'combined' life sentence. The total value of bribes taken by Zhou and his family was said to be 129.7 million yuan (~$18.87 million). State television showed Zhou pleading guilty with a head of fully gray hair, in contrast to his combed jet black hair dye he was known for prior to his retirement. Overseas media had compared Zhou's trial to that of Bo Xilai two years earlier, which was noted for being unusually open. In contrast to Bo, Zhou did not appear to dispute his charges. Bo, for the most part, denied his guilt and blamed much of the misdeeds he was accused of on his associates and his family. Zhou, on the other hand, said that \\"they tried to bribe my family, but really they were after my power. I should assume major responsibility for this.\\" State-run news agency Xinhua said that the trial took place in secret because state secrets involved in the case. However, it was also likely that Zhou's trial was not open to the public as a result of the sensitivity of the subject matter and its political implications. Observers also cited that the Bo trial became \\"out of control\\" as Bo made many shocking revelations during the deliberation of his trial which became tabloid fodder and led to many rumours circulating on social media, making the authorities more risk averse to do the same with Zhou. Zhou's son Zhou Bin absconded to the US in early 2013, and returned after negotiations with Chinese authorities. In June 2016, Zhou Bin was found guilty of taking 222 million yuan ($34m) in bribes and illegally trading in restricted commodities, and 350 million yuan ($53m) of illicit gains were confiscated; Zhou's wife, Jia Xiaoyue, was fined 1m yuan ($150,000) for bribe-taking. Zhou's son and wife were sentenced to 18 years and 9 years imprisonment respectively. Personal life Zhou Yongkang has two sons, Zhou Bin () and Zhou Han (), with his first wife, Wang Shuhua (), whom he met while working in the oilfields of Liaoning province. Wang has been described as a plain, hardworking woman who devoted much of her time to family and raising their two children. The couple had cordial relations while Zhou was at the Liaohe oil field, but the marriage later deteriorated. Zhou was said to be a workaholic on the oil fields, often working into the morning hours and sleeping in his office. Wang died in a motor vehicle collision in 2001, reportedly one of the vehicles involved had military license plates; the cause of the crash was unclear. In 2013, overseas Chinese news websites Mingjing and Boxun both reported that Zhou Yongkang had conspired with his secretary to kill Wang. The credibility of these reports has been questioned. After Wang died, Zhou married Jia Xiaoye (, also been written as ), a former reporter and television producer at CCTV-2, who is 28 years his junior. According to the autobiography of Shen Bing,Shen Bing (born 1976), is also a former television host with CCTV. It has been suggested by overseas Chinese media that Shen was a favourite of Zhou, though this has not been confirmed by any authoritative sources. Her autobiography was published in Hong Kong and its authenticity has been questioned. Zhou and Jia wed at a small, tense private ceremony; no photos were allowed to be taken. Jia continued to maintain a low profile following their wedding; she did not appear at any official functions with Zhou. Indeed, the first official mention of Jia Xiaoye in her capacity as Zhou's wife was during the latter's sentencing announcement in June 2015. Zhou's son, Zhou Bin, born in 1972, was a prominent oil and gas executive who ostensibly used his father's connections to further his own business interests. The younger Zhou was the primary shareholder and Chairman of Beijing Zhongxu Yangguang Energy Technology Holdings Ltd.The Chinese name of the company was \\"Âåó‰∫¨‰∏≠Êó≠Èò≥ÂÖâËÉΩÊ∫êÁßëÊäÄËÇ°‰ªΩÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏\\". Abbreviated Zhongxu) Zhou Bin was investigated, tried, and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The younger Zhou is married to Chinese-American Huang Wan (), whom he met while studying oil and gas exploration in Texas. Huang's mother, Zhan Minli (), held a stake in a number of companies with business dealings with China National Petroleum and lives in southern California. Zhou's younger son, Zhou Han, maintains a comparatively lower profile, and was not close to his father.

At above sea level, it is also the highest natural point in South East England (West Berkshire being a constituent part of this region), higher than Leith Hill in Surrey. Although traditionally the county top of Hampshire, the summit of Walbury Hill was placed under the administration of the former Berkshire county council when the civil parish of Combe was transferred from Hampshire in 1895. The historic border between the two counties near Walbury Hill runs along the Wayfarer's Walk, a long-distance footpath which lies about north of the triangulation pillar at the summit. The highest point of the historic county of Berkshire lies along this footpath, at a height of above sea level on the northern flank of the hill. Walbury Hill is the starting point for both the Test Way and the Wayfarer's Walk footpaths. The hill is a part of a ridge which forms the border between the southwest of Berkshire and the northwest of Hampshire, and also extends into Wiltshire. It is around southeast of the town of Hungerford. It is part of the Kirby House estate, owned by the Astor family. On the hill's summit is the Iron Age hill fort of Walbury Camp. Combe Gibbet stands on the adjoining Gallows Down. There is also a small low-level circular brick building, approximately 6 feet (1.8 metres) high, on the south side of the hill. This appears to be a disused reservoir. The true summit is marked by a triangulation pillar approximately from the main Test Way. Before the use of satellites was commonplace, Walbury Hill was occasionally used by the BBC as a temporary relay station during the Newbury Races. There is no metalled road across the hill, but the byway is open to all traffic and maintained with a hard gravel surface, because of its previous use by outside broadcast vehicles. The ridged summit is also popular with paragliding enthusiasts. It is one of three nationally important chalk wild grasslands in the North Wessex Downs, the others being Rushmore and Conholt Downs (SSSI) and part of Hog's Hole (SSSI).

She grew up in Tianjin, Shanghai and Hong Kong, and is known for her autobiography Falling Leaves. She is married to Professor Robert A. Mah with whom she has a daughter, and a son from a previous marriage. Life Adeline Yen Mah was born in Tianjin, Republic of China on 30November 1937 to Joseph Yen (Yen Tse- Rung), a businessman, and Ren Yong-ping, an accountant. She had an older sister called Lydia (Jun-pei) and three older brothers, Gregory (Zi-jie), Edgar (Zi-lin), and James (Zi-jun). She has stated in Falling Leaves that she did not use the real names of her siblings and their spouses to protect their identities but she did, however, use the real names of her father, stepmother, aunt and husband, while referring to her paternal grandparents only by the Chinese terms 'Ye Ye' and 'Nai Nai' . Yen Mah also writes of her Ye Ye's younger sister (Yan Shuzhen),, Yan Shuzhen and Huang Qiong-Xian founded the now-defunct Shanghai Women's Commercial and Savings Bank in 1924. whom she calls either 'Grand Aunt' or 'Grand Uncle Gong Gong', and cites as founder and president of the Shanghai Women's Commercial and Savings Bank.Chinese Cinderella, photo insert p. 1. When Yen Mah was a year old in 1938, Joseph Yen married a half-French, half-Chinese (Eurasian) 17-year-old girl named Jeanne Virginie Prosperi. The children referred to her as Niang (Â®ò ni√°ng, another Chinese term for mother), and she is called so throughout the whole book. They had two children, Franklin and Susan (Jun-qing). Her legal birthday is 30 November, as her father did not record her date of birth and instead he gave her his own (a common practice prior to the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949). Two weeks after her birth, her mother died of puerperal fever and according to traditional Chinese beliefs, Yen Mah was called 'bad luck' by the rest of her family and because of this, treated harshly throughout her childhood. =Shanghai and Hong Kong= After the death of Nai Nai, Yen Mah's father (Joseph) and stepmother (Niang) moved from Tianjin to Shanghai to a house along Avenue Joffre; Yen Mah and her full siblings joined them at the house afterward. Two months later, her Aunt Baba and Susan arrived (the former two delayed moving to observe the hundred days' mourning period for Ye Ye). When Susan arrived, she was too young and too close to Aunt Baba to recognise and like her mother, Niang, who thus beat her soundly in frustration. Yen Mah intervened, leading Niang to declare that she would never forgive her. The Yen family later moved to Hong Kong when Yen Mah was eleven, and she transferred to Sacred Heart School and Orphanage (Sacred Heart Canossian College). At the age of fourteen, as her autobiography states, Yen Mah won a playwriting competition for her work Gone With the Locusts, and her father allowed her to study in England with James. =University= Yen Mah left for the United Kingdom in August 1952, and studied medicine at the London Hospital Medical School, eventually establishing a medical practice in California. Before the start of her career in the United States, she had a brief relationship with a man named Karl, and practised medicine in a Hong Kong hospital at the behest of her father, who refused to give her air fare when she expressed plans to move to America. She has stated in an interview with the South China Morning Post that her father wanted her to become an obstetrician in the belief that women wanted treatment only from a female doctor, but as she hated obstetrics she became an anaesthesiologist instead. Literary career Her autobiography, Falling Leaves, was published in 1997, shortly after Jung Chang's memoir Wild Swans. It made the New York Times Bestseller list, selling over a million copies worldwide and translated into twenty two languages. Beginning with her traumatic childhood under her stepmother's cruelty, it goes on to recount how, after Joseph Yen died, Prosperi had prevented his children from reading his will until her own death two years later. When the wills were read, Yen Mah had apparently been disinherited. The success of Falling Leaves prompted Yen Mah to quit medicine and devote her time to writing. Falling Leaves was translated into Chinese for the Taiwan market. It was titled Luoyeguigen (T: ËêΩËëâÊ≠∏Ê†π, S: ËêΩÂè∂ÂΩíÊ†π, P: Lu√≤y√®guƒ´gƒìn). Unlike other cases of memoirs, the novel was translated by the original writer.Kang, Hana. \\"A Discourse Analysis of Code-Switching in Falling Leaves and Luoyeguigen (ËêΩËëâÊ≠∏Ê†π).\\" (Archive) Proceedings of the 20th North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics (NACCL-20). 2008.

Available on ProQuest. \\"Unlike many other translated autobiographies, the writer herself translated her English work (Falling Leaves) into Chinese for Taiwanese readers.\\" Her second work, Chinese Cinderella, was an abridged version of her autobiography (until she leaves to England), and has sold over one million copies worldwide. It received numerous awards, including The Children's Literature Council of Southern California in 2000 for Compelling Autobiography; and the Lamplighter's Award from National Christian School Association for Contribution to Exceptional Children's Literature in June 2002. Published in 2001, her third book, Watching the Tree, is about Chinese philosophy and traditional beliefs (including Traditional Chinese Medicine). A Thousand Pieces of Gold was published in 2002, and looks at events under the Qin and Han dynasties through Chinese proverbs and their origins in Sima Qian's history, Shiji. =Children's literature= Yen Mah has written three further books for children and young adults. Chinese Cinderella and the Secret Dragon Society, her first fiction work, is based on events in World War II, and Along the River, another fictional book based on Chinese history. China, Land of Dragons and Emperors is a non-fiction history book for young adults. In 2004, Yen Mah was voted fourth on the New Zealand children's best seller lists. Falling Leaves Foundation Adeline Yen Mah is Founder and President of the Falling Leaves Foundation, whose mission is \\"to promote understanding between East and West\\" and provides funds for the study of Chinese history, language, and culture. There is also a website dedicated to teaching Chinese over the Internet for free, and the foundation has established a poetry prize at UCLA. In 2013, she created an iPad game, PinYinPal, for learning Mandarin.

One of the first prominent male midwives in Britain, he designed an improved version of the obstetrical forceps, established safer delivery practices, and through his teaching and writing helped make obstetrics more scientifically based. He is often called the \\"father of British midwifery\\". Early life and education Smellie was born on 5 February 1697 in the town of Lesmahagow, Scotland. He was the only child of Sara Kennedy (1657‚Äì1727) and Archibald Smellie (1663/4‚Äì1735), a merchant and burgess of the town. Smellie practiced medicine before getting a license, opening an apothecary in 1720 in Lanark. It was not a particularly lucrative venture, as he also sold cloth as a side business to supplement his income, but he began reading medical books and teaching himself obstetrics at this time. By 1728, he was married to Eupham Borland, who was seven years his senior. In 1733 he was accepted as a member of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow. In 1739, after studying midwifery in Paris for a brief period, he established a practice and a pharmacy in London. In 1741 he began presenting obstetrics lectures and demonstrations to medical students and midwives. This practice proved far more successful than his first one, and Smellie made a name for himself in London. He then enrolled at the University of Glasgow and received his MD degree in 1745. Career William Smellie's surgical instruments, Hunterian Museum, Glasgow Smellie's work helped make obstetrics more scientifically-based. He invented a \\"machine\\" ‚Äì an obstetrical manikin ‚Äì for instructing his students. It essentially functioned as a model of the birthing process, and would nowadays be referred to as a \\"phantom\\". While not an original idea, the phantom was far more accurate than previous models and allowed him to visually demonstrate midwifing techniques. Use of forceps by William Smellie He also designed an improved version of the obstetrical forceps, which had been recently revealed after the midwifing Chamberlen family had kept it secret for generations. He publicized the use of these instruments although he promoted natural birth as the best method of delivery due to its less invasive nature. In his new version of the forceps, Smellie shortened and curved the blades and included a locking mechanism. In addition, he described the mechanism of labour, devised a maneuver to deliver the head of a breech, and published his teachings. He was the first person to document the natural birthing process and detailed the method by which the head of the child exited the female pelvis. Smellie challenged the commonly accepted concept of saving the mother over the child in times of complication. Through the introduction of forceps in the field of obstetrics, more delicate maneuvers could be performed and therefore obstetricians were able to equally weigh the life of the mother and child when complications did arise and were more often able to resolve the problem and save both. He was the first recorded figure to be able to resuscitate an infant after lung collapse and describe in detail uterine dystocia. Smellie was highly respected as a teacher as well as a midwife. Ten years after establishing his London practice, Smellie had 900 pupils and had delivered 280 lecture courses. His students did not gain any certification or fulfill medical training requirements by attending his courses, but came seeking to enhance their knowledge. As a teacher, Smellie tried to provide his students with live demonstrations to go along with course lectures. Consequently, he offered free midwifing services to patients if they allowed his students to observe the birthing process. This led to a more general practice of medical students attending births as a part of their medical training. One of his students, William Hunter, went on to become a well-known obstetrician and served as the physician of Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III. Unlike Hunter, Smellie was able to gain prestige and success without connections to highly reputable individuals in society. Through his humble background, Smellie was able to gain great acclaim through his interest in obstetrics and as an innovator of medical instruments and reference literature. Smellie's work was not without opposition. At the time, midwifery was a female-dominated profession. Most female midwives argued that it was inappropriate for men to assist women with childbirth, and many patients agreed. However, Smellie's work helped begin the shift of obstetrics from the work of women with some degree of experience to a medical field practiced largely by trained male physicians and surgeons. Death and legacy Smellie taught and midwifed until 1759, in which year he retired and returned to his hometown of Lanark. He passed his practice on to Dr. John Harvie, who had married Smellie's niece. In retirement, Smellie had a residence built which he called Smellom Hall, and focused on compiling and refining his findings into books, including the last volume of A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Midwifery. He died at the age of 66 on 5 March 1763, in time to finish his book but not to see it published. The tomb in which Smellie (and later his wife) was buried still stands in the St Kentigern's section of the state-run Lanark graveyard. In 1828, Harvie donated a portrait of Smellie to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Smellie most likely painted this portrait himself in 1719. In 1948 the Lockhart Hospital in Lanark opened a maternity department; by 1955 the entire hospital was given over to maternity services and the hospital was renamed the William Smellie Memorial Hospital. In 1992 the hospital closed and the maternity department, still called after William Smellie, was transferred to the Law Hospital in Carluke. In 2001 this unit closed and maternity services were moved to Wishaw General Hospital.  Controversy  In 2010, the self-described historian Don Shelton questioned the methods by which Smellie performed his research. In the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine he suggested that Smellie and his collaborator and later competitor William Hunter were responsible for multiple murders of pregnant women in order to gain access to corpses for anatomical dissection and physiological experimentation. Due to the inadequate match between supply and demand of corpses, scientists had to find other means, often requiring illegal methods, to obtain access. Shelton proposed that these two physicians used what would later be named \\"burking\\", after murderer William Burke, who killed 16 people in collusion with William Hare, selling the bodies to anatomist Dr. Robert Knox. He indicated that grave robbing was not a sufficient method by which obstetricians could access the specific type of tissue required for testing and dissection. In 1755, there was questioning of Smellie's access to corpses. Many of the accusations came from competitors, and fearing trial and even execution, Smellie stopped his work for several years in an effort to quash the suspicion that had been raised. Shelton's supposition was criticized by a number of medical historians who pointed out that already in 1761 Peter Camper indicated that the figures in Smellie's A Sett of Anatomical Tables \\"were not all from real life\\", and very likely other methods than murder were available to obtain bodies of recently-died pregnant women at that time. Helen King indicated that the response of the media and the internet to Shelton's publication \\"raised fresh questions about how medical history is generated, presented and evaluated in the media and, in particular, on the internet\\".  Works  A sett of anatomical tables (1754) *A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Midwifery (published in three volumes from 1752‚Äì64) describes the mechanism of labour and how to handle the normal birthing process along with various complications that might arise. The book was the first to set up procedures for ensuring the safe use of obstetrical forceps, as Smellie recognized that the forceps were a life-saving tool but best used sparingly. By the time Smellie published the first volume, he had been practicing for over 30 years and had been involved in around 1,150 deliveries. The information presented in his book was illuminating, as few people at the time had so much experience in midwifing. * A Sett of Anatomical Tables (1754) was also an important contribution to the field of obstetrics. This was a compilation of Smellie's anatomical drawings depicting childbirth and pregnancy. Though only one hundred copies were printed, it was groundbreaking in its detail and anatomical accuracy.

He was also a naturalist and antiquary, who was joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, co-founder of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and a friend of Robert Burns. Early life He was born in The Pleasance, in south-east Edinburgh in 1740, the son of Alexander Smellie, architect and master builder, and of his wife, Jean Robertson. He was educated at Duddingston School then Edinburgh High School. Smellie left school at 12 to years old to be apprenticed as a printer to Hamilton, Balfour & Neill in 1752. During this time he was promoted to the subeditorial position corrector of the press, and won his firm the Edinburgh Philosophical Society's prize for the most accurately printed edition of a Latin text. On completion of his apprenticeship he joined the firm of Murray & Cochran as a corrector for the Scots Magazine. He spent three hours per day in the evenings studying at extramural classes at the University of Edinburgh. In 1760 he founded the Newtonian Club, a sub-section of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society. He was also a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. On 27 March 1763 he married Jean Robertson in London. In 1765 he was awarded a gold medal for his dissertation on the sexes of plants, which contradicted the theories of the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica At the age of 28, Smellie was hired by Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell to edit the first edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, which appeared in 100 weekly instalments (\\"numbers\\") from December 1768 to 1771. It was a masterful composition although, by Smellie's own admission, he borrowed liberally from many authors of his day, such as Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson. Nevertheless, the first edition of the Britannica contained gross inaccuracies and fanciful speculations; for example, it states that excess use of tobacco could cause neurodegeneration, \\"drying up the brain to a little black lump consisting of mere membranes\\". Smellie strove to make Britannica as usable as possible, saying that \\"utility ought to be the principal intention of every publication. Wherever this intention does not plainly appear, neither the books nor their authors have the smallest claim to the approbation of mankind\\". Smellie entertained strong opinions; for example, he defines farriery as \\"the art of curing the diseases of horses. The practice of this useful art has been hitherto almost entirely confined to a set of men who are totally ignorant of anatomy, and the general principles of medicine.\\" Although possessed of wide knowledge, Smellie was not an expert in all matters; for example, his article on \\"Woman\\" has but four words: \\"the female of man.\\" Despite its incompleteness and inaccuracies, Smellie's vivid prose and the easy navigation of the first edition led to strong demand for a second; some prurient engravings by Andrew Bell (later censored by King George III) may also have contributed to the success of the first edition. Smellie did not participate in the second edition of the Britannica, because he objected to the inclusion of biographical articles in an encyclopedia dedicated to the arts and sciences. Later work and death William Smellie's grave, Greyfriars Kirkyard At the time of his hiring, Smellie edited a weekly called the Scots Journal, which made him familiar with the editing and publication of a work in parts. He went on to print and edit the Edinburgh Weekly Journal as joint owner with William Auld, and was co-owner, editor, and contributor to the Edinburgh Magazine and Review. He printed and edited Domestic Medicine: or, a Treatise on the Prevention and Cure of Diseases by Regimen and Simple Medicines by William Buchan in 1769. He also edited the first transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, which were published in 1792. Smellie is also noted for his English translation of the famous Histoire Naturelle of the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. In 1779, Smellie was nominated to be the University of Edinburgh's professor of natural history; however, the post was awarded to Dr. John Walker, allegedly due to politics. In 1781 Smellie was made keeper and superintendent of the Edinburgh Museum of Natural History. From 1782 he had William Creech as his business partner. Smellie continued to publish a wide variety of works, including his two-volume Philosophy of Natural History, which became a set text at Harvard University in the 19th century, and at least two of the four-volume set of Thesaurus medicus: sive, disputationum, in Academia Edinensi, ad rem medicam pertinentium, a collegio instituto ad hoc usque tempus, delectu which reprinted Edinburgh medical theses of the 18th century. In his Philosophy of Natural History he described the struggle for existence. He has been described as a \\"precursor of Darwin\\". His printing office stood at the foot of Anchor Close off the Royal Mile (on a site now on East Market Street) and his house was on Gosford's Close nearby.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1794/5 Gosford's Close was pulled down when the city built George IV Bridge in 1830.https://canmore.org.uk/site/116464/edinburgh-lawnmarket-gosfords-close He died in Edinburgh on 24 June 1795 and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard just north of the Adam Mausoleum, south-west of the church. He was well-acquainted with Robert Burns. Burns' assessment is engraved on Smellie's tombstone: \\"Here lies a man who did honour to human nature\\". Burns also described him fondly in a letter as \\"that old Veteran in Genius, Wit and Bawdry\\". Papers from Smellie's archive, including his correspondence and manuscripts, are held by the Library of the National Museum of Scotland.

She was a younger sister of King Louis IX of France (Saint Louis) and of Alfonso, Count of Poitiers, and an older sister of King Charles I of Sicily. In 1256, she founded the nunnery of Longchamp in part of the Forest of Rouvray (now called the Bois de Boulogne), west of Paris. Isabelle consecrated her virginity and her entire life to God alone. She is honored as a saint by the Franciscan Order. Her feast day is 22 February. Early life Isabelle's father died when she was two years old, and it was her mother, Blanche, who oversaw her education. She could read both Latin and the vernacular, and enjoyed tales of chivalry as well as devotional texts. While pursuing the traditional feminine interests such as embroidery, she took special pleasure in working on priestly vestments. As a child, she requested spiritual direction and became even more devoted to the Lord under the guidance of the Franciscans. By the papal bull of 26 May 1254, Pope Innocent IV allowed her to retain some Franciscan friars as her special confessors. She was even more devoted to the Franciscan Order than to her royal brother.Bihl, Michael. \\"St. Isabelle of France.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 30 December 2015 By virtue of the Treaty of Vend√¥me in March 1227, Isabelle was betrothed to Hugh, eldest son and heir of Hugh X of Lusignan, with the marriage contract being signed on June 1230; however, she refused to celebrate the formal wedding due to her fixed determination to remain a virgin, although she never became a nun. Later, she refused the hand of Conrad IV of Germany, son of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, although pressed to accept by everyone, even by Innocent IV. Longchamp Abbey As Isabelle wished to found a community of Sorores minores (Sisters minor), her brother King Louis began in 1255 to acquire the necessary land in the Forest of Rouvray, not far from the Seine, west of Paris. On 10 June 1256, the first stone of the monastic church was laid. Pope Alexander IV gave his sanction on 2 February 1259 to the new Rule, which was composed especially for this monastery by Isabelle along with a team of Franciscan university masters including St. Bonaventure. The community was allowed to hold property. The monastery was named the Convent of the Humility of the Blessed Virgin. In the Rule the nuns were called the Sisters of the Humble Order of Servants of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary. The nuns were subject to the Friars Minor. Some of the first nuns came from the Poor Clare monastery in Reims. A revised version of the Rule was approved by Pope Urban IV on 27 July 1263, which granted preferred name of Sorores minores inclusae, or Enclosed Sisters minor, for the nuns of Longchamp. Isabelle never joined the community herself, but did live there in a room separate from the nuns' cells. Isabelle refused to become abbess, which allowed her to retain her wealth and resources, so she could support her abbey and continue to give to the poor. She kept a discipline of silence for most of her day. Death Isabelle died at Longchamp on 23 February 1270, and was buried in the abbey church. After nine days her body was exhumed; according to the religious legend, it showed no signs of decay, and many miracles were said to have been wrought at her grave. In 1521 Pope Leo X allowed the abbey to celebrate her feast day with a special Office. On 4 June 1637, a second exhumation took place. On 25 January 1688, the nuns obtained permission to celebrate her feast with an octave, and in 1696 the celebration of the feast on 31 August was permitted to the whole Franciscan Order by Pope Innocent XII. Longchamp Abbey was suppressed in the French Revolution. In 1794 the empty building was offered for sale, but, as no one wished to purchase it, it was destroyed. In 1857 the remaining walls were pulled down, except for one tower, and the land was incorporated into the Bois de Boulogne.

California bungalows became popular in suburban neighborhoods across the United States, and to varying extents elsewhere, from around 1910 to 1939. Principal features =Exterior= Zellers-Langel House, Franklin County, Ohio Bungalows are one or one and a half story houses, with sloping roofs and eaves with unenclosed rafters, and typically feature a dormer window (or an attic vent designed to look like one) over the main portion of the house. Ideally, bungalows are horizontal in massing, and are integrated with the earth by use of local materials and transitional plantings. This helps create the signature look most people associate with the California bungalow. Bungalows commonly have wood shingle, horizontal siding or stucco exteriors, as well as brick or stone exterior chimneys and a partial-width front porch. Larger bungalows might have asymmetrical \\"L\\" shaped porches. The porches were often enclosed at a later date, in response to increased street noise. A \\"California\\" bungalow (except in Australia, see below) is not made of brick, but in other bungalows, most notably in the Chicago area, this is commonplace due in large part to the weather. A variation called the \\"Airplane Bungalow\\" has a much smaller area on its second floor, centered on the structure, and is thought to look like the cockpit of an early airplane. =Interior= True bungalows do not include quarters for servants, and have a simple living room, entered directly from the front door, in place of parlors and sitting rooms, as well as a smaller kitchen. The focal point of the living room is the fireplace, and the living room often has a broad opening into a separate dining room. All common areas are on the first floor with cozy atmospheres. Though the ceilings are lower than in homes of Victorian architecture, they often feature redwood beams and are usually higher than in ranches and other homes built later. Attics are located under the sloping roof. Early history Louisville's Deer Park Neighborhood The bungalow actually traces its origins to the Indian province of Bengal, the word itself derived from the Hindi bangla or house in Bengali style. The native thatched roof huts were adapted by the British, who built bungalows as houses for administrators and as summer retreats. Refined and popularized in California, many books list the first California house dubbed a bungalow as the one designed by the San Francisco architect A. Page Brown in the early 1890s. However, Brown's close friend, Joseph Worcester, designed a bungalow for himself and erected it atop a hill in Piedmont, across the bay from San Francisco, in 1877-78. The bungalow influenced Bernard Maybeck, Willis Polk and other San Francisco architects, and Jack London, who rented Worcester's house from 1902‚Äì03, called it a \\"bungalow with a capital 'B. The bungalow became popular because it met the needs of changing times in which the lower middle class were moving from apartments to private houses in great numbers. The style was also connected with the desire to find relief from modern technology through a return to nature. Bungalows were modest, inexpensive and low-profile. Before World War I, a bungalow could be built for as little as $900 although the price rose to around $3,500 after the war. Bungalow designs were spread by the practice of building from mail-order plans available from illustrated catalogs, sometimes with alterations based on local practice or conditions. Contractors and builders would sell the catalogs at a low cost and in some cases, give them away for free. They contained pictures and drawings of artistic bungalows. The style was also connected with the desire to find relief from modern technology through a return to nature. A variety of firms offered precut homes, which were shipped by rail or ship and assembled on site. These were most common in locations without a strong existing construction industry, or for company towns, to be built in a short time. The majority of bungalows did include some elements of mass production; typically doors, windows, and built-in furnishings such as bookcases, desks, or folding beds were sourced from lumber yards or from catalogs. Bungalows can be found in the older neighborhoods of most American cities. In fact, they were so popular for a time that many cities have what is called a \\"Bungalow Belt\\" of homes built in the 1920s. These neighborhoods were often clustered along streetcar lines as they extended into the suburbs. Bungalows were built in smaller groups than is typical today, often one to three at a time. =United States= San Diego's North Park Neighborhood Examples of neighborhoods in Southern California with a high concentration of California Bungalows include: Belmont Heights in Long Beach, the Wood Streets in Riverside, Bungalow Heaven, Highland Park in Los Angeles, and North Park (site of the proposed \\"Dryden District\\") in San Diego. Separate from the main building, The Beverly Hills Hotel has 23 garden bungalows containing guests rooms and suites. Examples in other U.S. States include: the Avenues District in Salt Lake City; Midtown Columbus, Georgia; Virginia Highland and Candler Park, Atlanta; Houston Heights in Houston; Park Hill and Washington Park in Denver; Takoma Park, Maryland, and Takoma, Washington, D.C.; Cherrydale and other neighborhoods in Arlington County, Virginia; Del Ray in Alexandria, Virginia; Historic Kenwood in St. Petersburg, Florida; The Garden District in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and the West University Neighborhood in Tucson, Arizona. = Australia and New Zealand = The Californian bungalow style was particularly popular in Australia from 1913 onwards. This period coincided with the rise of the Hollywood film industry, which popularised American clothes, furniture, cars and houses, and also with the increased importation of U.S. architectural magazines into Australia, a society which previously had been heavily influenced by British domestic styles. \\"...the concept of the bungalow as a cheap and attractive form of permanent suburban housing for the masses was stimulated by a variety of economic and social factors.\\"Clare, John (1986) The Californian Bungalow in Australia. In Historic Environment Vol.1, 1986. Page 21. Council for Historic Environment Timber versions of the bungalow were a low cost solution to shortages in housing and the California designs suited the growing suburbs of the larger cities in southern Australia. Having a similar climate to that of California the designs also reflected the requirements of Australians who needed to cater for relatively warm summers and mild winters. The bungalow in Australia underwent regional adaptations, often being built in the local red brick in Melbourne and the local liver-coloured brick of Sydney, and in limestone in South Australia. The bungalow was also constructed out of timber - in tropical Queensland these were raised on high () stilts as the Ashgrovian Queenslander (the idea being to allow free movement of air in the hot climate). Key practitioners of the California bungalow style were Peddle and Thorp, Kenneth B. Milne, Alexander Stewart Jolly and Cedric Ballantyne. One of the outstanding examples was Jolly's Belvedere in the Sydney suburb of Cremorne. Belvedere is heritage-listed.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/45 The Californian bungalow was also common in New Zealand during the latter 1910s and 1920s (eg Railway houses), and is credited with starting a trend towards bungalows and influencing new local styles of bungalow in New Zealand during the early decades of the 20th century.

Stylistic evolution The bungalow was so popular in California and Australia that very few houses were built in any other style during the 1920s. A range of other detailing influences, including Georgian Revival, Dutch Colonial Revival, Mission Revival, and Spanish Colonial Revival Styles became very popular in the first half of the 1900s. =Resurgence in interest in United States= Resurgent interest in the American Arts & Crafts or American Craftsman movement and the emergence of special-interest publications such as American Bungalow magazine have contributed to the bungalow's recent popularity. Rising house prices nationwide through the late 1990s and early 2000s as well as the central and convenient location of many bungalow-heavy urban neighborhoods have further fueled demand for these houses; as one example, some three- bedroom bungalows in San Diego can sell for $650,000 to $700,000, or more. The strength of the local housing market must be considered, however, as many bungalows in Detroit, Michigan have been abandoned, and are being razed.

In principle, it refers to the discriminatory treatment against individuals whose height is not within the normal acceptable range of height in a population. Various studies have shown it to be a cause of bullying, commonly manifested as unconscious microaggressions. Research indicates that the human brain uses height as a heuristic measure of social status and fitness. Studies have observed that infants as young as 10 months old unconsciously associate physical size with leadership potential, power, strength and intelligence. Both the cognitive and the unconscious heuristic association between height and the mentioned traits has also been found to be stronger when assessing men than women.Nancy Blaker, Irene Rompa, Inge Dessing, Anne Vriend, Channah Herschberg, Mark van Vugt, (2013) \\"The height leadership advantage in men and women: Testing evolutionary psychology predictions about the perceptions of tall leaders\\", DOI: 10.1177/1368430212437211, accessed 05/12/17Stulp G., Buunk A. P., Verhulst S. and Pollet T. V, (2015), \\"Human height is positively related to interpersonal dominance in dyadic interactions\\", PLoS ONE 10, e0117860 10.1371/journal.pone.0117860, accessed 05/12/17Joey Cheng, Jessica Tracy, Cameron Anderson, (2014) \\"The Psychology of Social Status\\", c. 6, p. 123 Lexicology The term height bigot was first used on the Mary Tyler Moore episode 7 of season 1 in October 1970. Mary is asked out by a charming, intelligent but very short man. Despite having a good time with him on a date she's apprehensive about going out with him again because of his height. She declares herself a ‚Äúheight bigot‚Äù to her friend Rhoda. The term heightism was coined by sociologist Saul Feldman in a paper titled \\"The presentation of shortness in everyday life‚Äîheight and heightism in American society: Toward a sociology of stature\\", presented at the meeting of the American Sociological Association in 1971.Feldman, Saul. \\"The presentation of shortness in everyday life‚Äîheight and heightism in American society: Toward a sociology of stature Paper\\". Presented at the meeting of the American Sociological Association. Chicago, Il. 1971.heightism, n.\\" OED Online. June 2003. Oxford University Press. September 2006. Heightism was included in the Second Barnhart Dictionary of New English (1971) and popularized by Time magazine in a 1971 article on Feldman's paper. The word is an example of Time magazine's habit of supplying new words through \\"unusual use of affixes\\", although Time itself objected to the term's inclusion in the 1991 Random Webster's College Dictionary, citing it as an example of the dictionary \\"straining ... to avoid giving offense, except to good usage\\" and \\"[lending] authority to scores of questionable usages, many of them tinged with politically correct views.\\" The term heightism can also be seen as an example of the increase in popular usage of phrases, particularly those relating to prejudice and discrimination, patterned after that of the word sexism. Height discrimination can also come in the form of pejorative slang terms such as manlet for short men, or lanklet for tall people.The Tall Book: A Celebration of Life from on High, Arianne Cohen - 2009 Height and social discrimination =Employment wage and social experience discrimination= A research paper published in the Journal of Applied Psychology showed that height is strongly related to success for men. It showed that increase in height for men corresponds to increase in income after controlling for other social psychological variables like age and weight. Economists Nicola Persico, Andrew Postlewaite and Dan Silverman conjectured a \\"height premium\\" and found that \\"a 1.8-percent increase in wages accompanies every additional inch of height\\". They also found that men's wages as adults could be linked to their height at age 16. The researchers found that on an average an increase in height by one inch at age 16 increased male adult wages by 2.6 percent. This is equal to increase of approximately $850 in 1996 annual earnings. In other words, the height and corresponding social experiences of taller male adolescent at age 16 would likely translate to higher wage in later adulthood as compared to shorter male adolescent. Recent findings suggest that height discrimination occurs most often against racial minorities. A 2007 study found that African-Americans reported higher weight and height related discrimination. This discrimination was even higher in female employees. In 2017, attourney and author lawyer Tanya Osensky published Shortchanged: Height Discrimination and Strategies for Social Change. The book exposes the cultural, medical, and occupational issues that short people face, which are often deemed unimportant and disregarded. Osensky challenges heightism by disclosing some beneficial aspects of shortness and suggesting avenues of activism and change. =In business= Some jobs require a minimum height. For example, US Military pilots have to be tall with a sitting height of . These exceptions noted, in the great majority of cases a person's height would not seem to have an effect on how well they are able to perform their job. Nevertheless, studies have shown that short people are paid less than taller people, with disparities similar in magnitude to the race and gender gaps. Surveys have uncovered that less than 3% of CEOs were below 1.70 m (5 ft 7 in) in height. 90% of CEOs are of above average height.\\"Short Guys Finish Last\\" The world's most enduring form of discrimination. The Economist, 23 December 1995. In 2018, market researcher Seth Ulinski published Amazing Heights: How Short Guys Stand Tall. The book highlights that through technology and an entrepreneurial mindset, members of the \\"short guy fraternity\\" are able to blaze their own paths, bypassing potential glass ceilings and pay gaps. For example, short guy fraternity members include: Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos 1.70 m (5 ft 7 in), Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg 1.70 m (5 ft 7 in) and Google co-founder and Alphabet President Sergey Brin 1.73 m (5 ft 8 in). With an estimated net worth of over $150 billion, Bezos is ranked as the richest person in the world, while Zuckerberg and Brin consistently rank in the top 20. =Perceived attractiveness= While it is popularly believed that height is a revealed preference of physical attraction, contemporary literature is mixed in its results. Initial studies indicated that taller men are more likely to be married and to have more children, except in societies with severe sex imbalances caused by war.Miami University of Ohio: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Want No Short, Short Man: The Study Of Height, Power, and Mate Selection‚Äù. However, more recent research has drawn this theory into question, finding no correlation between height and offspring count.\\"Physique Correlates with Reproductive Success in an Archival Sample of Delinquent Youth\\". Moreover, research on leg length and leg-to-body ratio conflicts with the notion that there is a distinct preference for taller mates. A 2008 study found that both extremes, tall and short, reduced attractiveness, and a 2006 study found that a higher leg-to- body ratio in both genders increased aesthetic appeal.\\"Adaptive Preferences for Leg Length in a Potential Partner\\".\\"The leg-to-body ratio as a human aesthetic criterion\\". At the roughest approximation the limb ratio findings are consistent with data relating height to human health. Conversely, research by Dan Ariely found that American women exhibit a marked preference for dating taller men, and that for shorter men to be judged attractive by women, they must earn substantially more money than taller men.\\"Ariely found that a 5'4\\" man would need to make $229,000 more than a 6' man to have equal appeal; a 5'6\\" man would need $183,000 more; a 5'10\\" man would need $32,000 more.\\" Lori Gottlieb (2010). Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough. Penguin, p. 239 A 2012 study found that both men and women are willing to excuse height differences by using a trade-off approach. Men may compensate 1.3 BMI units with a 1 percent higher wage than their wife. Women may compensate 2 BMI units with an additional year of higher education. Furthermore, a 2015 study found that both men and women receive benefits for having a tall spouse. Nonetheless, on a cultural level in Post-industrial society, a sociological relationship between height and perceived attractiveness exists. For instance, in a 2019 survey performed by Ipsos in Hungary with over 500 respondents, the perfect height for men for 53% of participants was between 1.78 m (5 ft 10 in) to 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in), while regarding female ideal height, 60% of respondents stated that it should be between 1.65 m (5 ft 5 in) and 1.75 m (5 ft 9 in), indicating a predominant preference for average to moderately tall height in both sexes. This cultural characteristic of confering relevance to height as an indicator of attractiveness, while applicable to the modernized world, is not a transcendental human quality.\\"How universal are human mate choices? Size doesn‚Äôt matter when Hadza foragers are choosing a mate\\". A study produced by the Universities of Groningen and Valencia, has found that men who felt most anxious about attractive, physically dominant, and socially powerful rivals, were less jealous, the taller they were themselves.Short men are the jealous type - March 13, 2008\\". Charlotte Gill argues in The Independent that fat- shaming women is much less accepted than short-shaming men, although the latter is even worse. =In the media= In the media, heightism can take the form of making fun of people whose height is out of the normal range in ways that would be unseemly if directed at skin color or weight. An example is Kevin Connolly's portrayal of Eric \\"E\\" Murphy in HBO's television series Entourage (Connolly is )Kevin Connolly (I) - Biography. Similarly, shorter men are often denied leading roles. Although some famous cinema actors such as Alan Ladd have been short in real life, in their fictional depictions they have been presented as taller. In 1987 the BBC comedy series A Small Problem imagined a totalitarian society in which people under the height of were systematically discriminated against. The program attracted considerable criticism and complaints which accused the writers of reinforcing prejudice and of using offensive terms; the writers responded that their intention had been to show all prejudice was stupid and that height was chosen randomly.A Small Problem in BBC Comedy Guide. S&M; Short and Male, a documentary aired in 2008, demonstrated the obstacles and bigotry that short statured men face every day in life, love and work. Legislation Currently, there is one state in the United States of America, Michigan, that prohibits height discrimination.Text of the Elliot Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976. There is pending legislation introduced by Massachusetts Representative Byron Rushing which would add Massachusetts to the list.Text (PDF) of Massachusetts House bill 3752, 2006.

They were the most deadly bushfires that Tasmania has ever experienced, leaving 62 people dead, 900 injured and over seven thousand homeless.Whitaker, p. 134.Whitaker, p. 141.  Extent of the fires  110 separate fire fronts burnt through some of land in southern Tasmania within the space of five hours. Fires raged from near Hamilton and Bothwell to the D'Entrecasteaux Channel as well as Snug. There was extensive damage to agricultural property along the Channel, the Derwent Valley and the Huon Valley. Fires also destroyed forest, public infrastructure and properties around Mount Wellington and many small towns along the Derwent estuary and east of Hobart.  Death toll and damage  The worst of the fires was the Hobart Fire, which encroached upon the city of Hobart. In total, the fires claimed 62 lives in a single day. Property loss was also extensive with 1293 homes and over 1700 other buildings destroyed. The fires destroyed 80 bridges, 4800 sections of power lines, 1500 motor vehicles and over 100 other structures. It was estimated that at least 62,000 farm animals were killed. The total damage amounted to $40,000,000 in 1967 Australian dollar values. The resulting insurance payout was the then largest in Australian history.  Causes  The late winter and early spring of 1966 had been wet over southeastern Tasmania, resulting in a large amount of vegetation growth by November. However, in November, Tasmania began its driest eight-month period since 1885, and by the end of January 1967 the luxuriant growth in the area had dried off. Though January was a cool month, hot weather began early in February, so that in the days leading up to 7 February 1967, several bush fires were burning uncontrolled in the areas concerned. Some of these fires had been deliberately lit for burning off, despite the extremely dry conditions at the time. Reports into the causes of the fire stated that only 22 of the 110 fires were started accidentally. Shortly before midday on the 7th, a combination of extremely high temperatures, (the maximum was 39 ¬∞C (102 ¬∞F)), very low humidity and very strong winds from the northwest led to disaster. Although this fire was by far the worst in loss of life and property in Tasmanian history, the meteorological conditions are common. McArthur's report on the fire notes that \\"very similar conditions have occurred on three or four occasions during the past 70 years.\\"  Comparison with other major Australian bushfires  If considered in terms of both loss of property and loss of life, in 1967 this represented one of the worst disasters to have occurred in Australia. It is comparable in scale with the 1939 Black Friday bushfires in Victoria (where the loss of 72 lives was nevertheless spread over several days) and the subsequent 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires in Victoria and South Australia, which claimed 75 lives and razed over 2,000 homes. The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires north of Melbourne, and elsewhere in Victoria, in which 173 people died, share the same commencement date of 7 February. Memorial A memorial for the 1967 Bushfires was built at Snug in the Kingborough municipality, south of Hobart, where a plaque with the names of the 62 people killed is fixed to a brick chimney. The memorial has storyboards telling the story of the 1967 fires, as well as bushfire preparedness information. It is surrounded by a garden of fire resistant native plants.

Biography  Born in Tarn√≥w, Poland and raised in Krak√≥w, he was captured by the German army during World War II forced onto a train and deported to Auschwitz. However, before the train reached the notorious concentration camp, though, Hornstein jumped from its side. He spent the rest of the war ‚Äî which claimed the lives of innumerable of his family members and friends ‚Äî hiding from the Nazis in the forests of Czechoslovakia and living in Budapest before decamping for Bratislava. In Bratislava, he met Renata Witelson, another Polish Jew fleeing Nazi persecution. Witelson had spent much of the war in hiding ‚Äî in the Warsaw Ghetto, in a convent, with a Polish family and in safe houses. It was in one of those safe houses that the couple met. In 1946, they were married in Rome. He immigrated to Canada in 1951, at the encouragement of the Canadian ambassador to Italy, whom they had befriended, and relocated to Montreal. He became a citizen in 1957. He founded the company, Federal Construction Ltd., a real estate company, where he made his fortune and remained president of the company until his final days. The Hornstein became prominent patrons of major Montreal institutions, including hospitals and universities. But the couple is most closely associated with the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA). Michal Hornstein had served on its board of trustees, almost continuously, since 1970. He also played an important role raising funds for the museum's collection, amassing a vast collection of Renaissance paintings and helped raise millions that went toward restoring and expanding the museum. Michal Hornstein contributed to the collection himself, donating some 420 works of art, and played a role in the acquisition of 23 others. In 2012, the couple announced it was donating its collection of 75 Old Master paintings to the museum, a gift estimated to be worth $75 million. The MMFA described it as the largest ever private donation to a Quebec museum. The Old Masters collection is to be housed in the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace, which is scheduled to open in early November 2016. The couple's name also graces an existing pavilion, which houses galleries dedicated to Asian and Islamic art. The Hornsteins also donated money to education and health care, namely the Montreal Heart Institute, the Montreal General Hospital, H√¥pital Notre Dame and the Jewish General Hospital. On Wednesday, June 11, 2014 at the John Molson School of Business‚Äô spring convocation ceremony, Concordia University conferred upon Michal and Renata Hornstein honorary doctorates in recognition of their lifetime of philanthropy.  Death  Hornstein died at his home in Montreal, Quebec on April 25, 2016, aged 95.  Honours  In 1984 he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. In 1993 he was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec, promoted to Officer in 2002 and Grand Officer in 2013.

Some Coptic manuscript fragments recovered at Fayyum appear to contain a sort of commentary or homily on the gospel. Al-Biruni, who still had access to the full text, commented that it was a \\"gospel of a special kind\\", unlike any of the gospels of the Christians, and that the Manichaeans insisted that theirs was the only true gospel, and that the various gospels of the Christians misrepresented the truth about the Messiah.Schneemelcher, Wilhelm (ed); Wilson, Robert McLachan (English transl.1991; 2003): New Testament Apocrypha: Gospels and related writings.' Cambridge: James Clark; Louisville, Kentucky: John Knox Press. Pp 406-411. (Link and website checked 2012-04-30.) There is a tendency in historical scholarship to confuse the Mani's Living Gospel with another of his works,Schneemelcher, Wilhehelm (ed); Wilson, Robert McLachan (English transl.1991; 2003): New Testament Apocrypha: Gospels and related writings.' Cambridge: James Clark; Louisville, Kentucky: John Knox Press. Pp 409.

(Link and website checked 2012-04-30.) given the name of Eik≈çn in Greek and Coptic. This was a book containing illustrations to accompany and facilitate the understanding of Mani‚Äôs cosmology. Photius (or pseudo-Photius) comments on the text, saying that it contains a falsified account of some of the acts of Jesus,Lardner, Nathaniel (1857): The works of Nathaniel Lardner in five volumes, Vol II. London: Thomas Hamilton, pp 151-157 (Link and website checked 2012-04-30.) while Peter of Sicily insists that it contained no such material.Lardner, Nathaniel (1857): The works of Nathaniel Lardner in five volumes, Vol II. London: Thomas Hamilton, pp 151-157 (Link and website checked 2012-04-30.) It is known that the gospel had 22 parts, each labelled by a different letter of the Aramaic alphabet. The combination of two Turfan fragments allows the reconstruction of the text of the first part (alaph). The section deals with the nature of the \\"King of the World of Light\\" who resides at the \\"Navel of the World\\" but is also present on his whole earth, from without as from within, having no limits except where his earth borders on that of his enemy, the \\"Kingdom of Darkness\\". Schneemelcher (1990) suggests tentatively that the text may have been designed as a gospel of the gnostic type, perhaps intended to comment on or replace the Christian gospel.

The first copy was issued on 1 July 1866. In 1868, he co-authored Teka Sta≈Ñczyka, a series of satirical pamphlets on the political situation in Galicia published in the PrzeglƒÖd magazine. From 1867 Tarnowski served as member of the Sejm in Galicia. In 1885 he became a member of the Herrenhaus in Vienna. Between 1871 and 1909, he was a professor and twice Rector of Jagiellonian University. From 1873 he was a member, and from 1890 to 1917 chairman, of the Akademia Umiejetnosci (Polish Academy of Learning).

In addition, he is President of the Jacques Maritain Institute of Cuba and also President of Editorial Cubana. The party's manifesto, (created in Miami 1991) states; \\"We have made the decision to found the Christian Democratic Party of Cuba because we wish to offer a political alternative to our mother country in the fight for human rights, economic development and social justice within a democratic and pluralistic framework.\\" The party invokes the legacy of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and Jos√© Mart√≠, whom they say \\"conceived Latin America as a brotherhood of shared, common and sovereign nations.\\" The Christian Democratic Party of Cuba are publicly against all foreign intervention in Cuba, and declare their opposition to the United States embargo.

It is located in the southwestern part of the historical centre of the city, between the Academy building and the old Leiden Observatory building.  History  Hortus Botanicus Leiden in 1610. Print by Jan Cornelisz. Woudanus and Willem Isaacsz. van Swanenburg. Hortus Botanicus (behind Observatory), ca. 1920-1940 In 1587 the young University of Leiden asked for permission from the mayor of Leiden to establish a hortus academicus behind the university building, for the benefit of the medical students. The request was granted in 1590, and the famous botanist Carolus Clusius (1526‚Äì1609) was appointed as prefect. Clusius arrived in Leiden in 1593. His knowledge, reputation, and international contacts allowed him to set up a very extensive plant collection. Clusius also urged the Dutch East India Company (VOC) to collect plants and (dried) plant specimens in the colonies. The original garden set up by Clusius was small (about 35 by 40 meters), but contained more than 1000 different plants. The collecting of tropical (from the Indies) and sub-tropical (from the Cape Colony) plants was continued under Clusius' successors. Especially Herman Boerhaave (1668‚Äì1738, prefect from 1709‚Äì1730), contributed greatly to the fame of the Hortus with his efforts to collect new plants and specimens, and with his publications, such as a catalog of the plants then to be found in the Hortus. Another major contribution to the collections was made by Philipp Franz von Siebold, a German physician who was employed on Deshima (Japan) by the VOC from 1823 until his expulsion by Japan in 1829. During that period he collected many dried and living plants from all over Japan (as well as animals, ethnographical objects, maps, etc.), and sent them to Leiden. The first greenhouses appeared in the Hortus in the second half of the 17th century, the monumental Orangery was built between 1740 and 1744. From its original plan the Hortus was expanded in 1736 by Adriaan van Royen and Carl Linnaeus, and in 1817 by Theodor Friedrich Ludwig Nees von Esenbeck and Sebald Justinus Brugmans. In 1857, a part was used for building the new Leiden Observatory.  Collection  Winter garden From a historical perspective, the old Tuliptree (Liriodendron tulipifera) from 1716, Date plum (Diospyros lotus) from 1739, Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) from 1785 and Golden Chain (Laburnum anagyroides) from 1725 to 1818, are worth mentioning. The greenhouses with Victoria amazonica and other tropical plants, and the large collection of sub- tropical plants in the recently renovated Orangery and the new Winter Garden draw many visitors. The park itself is an oasis inside the old city, with many more interesting plants and trees. A Japanese garden in honour of Von Siebold opened in 1990. A reconstruction of Clusius' original garden, based on a plant list dating from the end of the 16th century, was opened in 2009. Victoria Regia. End of the 19th century. From a scientific point of view, the Leiden Hortus is known for its collections of Asian Araceae (among which the Giant Arum Amorphophallus titanum), Hoya, Dischidia, Nepenthes, ferns and one of the biggest collections of Asian orchids in the world.

Soumet moved to Paris in 1810 and wrote poems in honor of Napoleon that secured his nomination as auditeur of the Conseil d'√âtat. His elegy La pauvre fille appeared in 1814, and two successful tragedies produced in 1822, Clytemnestre and Sa√ºl, secured his admission to the Academy in 1824. Jeanne d'Arc (1825) was his most critically acclaimed play. Elisabeth de France (1828) was a weak imitation of Schiller's Don Carlos, But Soumet's real bent was towards epic poetry. A poem inspired by Klopstock, La divine √©pop√©e, describes the descent of Christ into Hades. Soumet's Norma, ou L'infanticide (Norma, or The Infanticide) was adapted by Vincenzo Bellini into the well-known opera Norma. Under Louis XVIII Soumet became librarian of Saint-Cloud, and subsequently was transferred to Rambouillet and to Compi√®gne. He died leaving an unfinished epic on Jeanne d'Arc.

It is on the Gulf of Thailand's eastern seaboard, 300 km from Bangkok, near the border with Cambodia.archive- url=//web.archive.org/web/20200113104227/https://www.tourismthailand.org/Destinations/Provinces/ko- chang/467archive-date=13 January 2020url-status=live The island Ko Chang occupies most of the district's land area, along with several smaller islands. With an area of 210 km2, Ko Chang is the third-largest island in Thailand by area, after Phuket and Ko Samui. The name Ko Chang means 'Elephant Island' and derives from its elephant-shaped headland. Despite the presence of elephants on the island, they are not indigenous. At present, there are eight villages on the island. History Plaque commemorating the Ko Chang battle Prior to World War II, Ko Chang was little known. During this period, the few families there made a living growing coconuts and fruits. On 17 January 1941, Ko Chang was the scene of the Battle of Ko Chang between the Royal Thai Navy and a much stronger Vichy French naval squadron, in which the French won a decisive victory. Ko Chang Yutthanawi Day, which occurs in late-January at the Ko Chang Yutthanawi Memorial on Laem Ngop, commemorates the Royal Thai Navy's engagement against the French colonialists. There is an exhibition by the Royal Thai Navy, and merit-making and tribute rites are performed for those killed in the battle. Geography Ko Chang is part of an archipelago of 52 islands. It is approximately 30 km long by 14 km, wide. It is part of the Mu Ko Chang National Park, which covers an area of 650 km2, of which 70 percent is offshore. It is a mountainous island, with Khao Salak Phet being the highest peak at 744 metres. The island is known for several waterfalls, coral reefs, and rainforests. The main settlements on the west coast are around Sai Khao, Hat Kai Mook, Hat Kai Bae, Ban Klong Prao and the fishing village of Bang Bao on the south coast. The island's administrative centre is Ban Dan Mai on the east coast. Hat Khlong Phrao Beach Climate Most of Thailand receives from 1,200 to 1,600 mm of precipitation per year. Two provinces, Trat and Ranong, receive more than 4,500 mm a year making them the wettest places in the country. Wildlife Ko Chang is home to populations of the stump- tailed macaque, the small Indian civet, the small Asian mongoose, 61 bird species, and a number of snakes and deer. The Ko Chang frog (Limnonectes kohchangae) was originally thought to be an endemic species, but has also been found on the mainland. Administration The island forms a district (amphoe) in the province of Trat. It was formed on 30 April 1994, when it was split off from Laem Ngop District, at first being classed as a minor district (king amphoe). On 15 May 2007, the nation's 81 minor districts were upgraded to full districts. With publication in the Royal Gazette on 24 August, the upgrade became official. Ko Chang District is divided into two sub-districts (tambons) which are home to nine villages (mubans): 1\\\\. Ko Chang (), consisting of four villages with 3,010 inhabitants: *Ban Khlong Nonsi *Ban Dan Mai *Ban Khlong Son *Ban Khlong Phrao 2\\\\. Ko Chang Tai (), consisting of five villages with 2,346 inhabitants: *Bang Bao *Ban Salak Phet *Ban Chek Bae *Ban Salak Khok *Ban Salak Phet Nuea Transport =Air= Ko Chang has no airport. The nearest airport is Trat Airport 17 km from the Ao Thammachat Ko Chang ferry terminal on the mainland. =Road= There are two main roads on Ko Chang, running the length of the east and west coasts. Both roads start at Ao Sapparot in the north, near the ferry piers. Shorter roads branch out to Ploytalay Resort and Keereephet, Khlong Nueng, and Klong Phu waterfalls. The nearest long distance road transport is at Trat town, from where the 300 km journey to Bangkok takes five hours by bus. =Boat= There are two ferry companies that run services from the mainland to Ko Chang. Both take vehicles and passengers. During high season, from November to May, there are passenger- only boat services from Ko Chang to the outlying islands of Ko Wai, Ko Mak, and Ko Kut. Boats do not run to outlying islands all year . They stop August / September times due to big seas and low season. Economy Ko Chang's income derives largely from tourism, but some traditional livelihoods still exist. Many of Ko Chang's villages rely on fishing, with Ban Salak Phet () being the largest and oldest community on Ko Chang, in a sheltered location in the south of the island. Other fishing villages include Bang Bao (), at Bang Bao Beach, which consists of houses on stilts built into the sea, and Ban Khlong Son, which also partly relies on rubber plantations. Ban Dan Mai and Ban Khlong Non Si also have coconut plantations, and orchards of lychee trees. The variety of lychee grown, Silaman 200 years, is believed to be found only on Ko Chang. The first foreign backpackers started arriving on Ko Chang in the mid-1970s, using local fishing boats, when the island was still undeveloped. In 2019 tourism is the island's biggest earner. In 1982, Ko Chang along with the surrounding area became part of the protected Mu Ko Chang National Park, with approximately 85 percent of the island, together with nearby coral reefs, falling within the park. In 2020, an American tourist was arrested for posting negative feedback about his experience at a hotel in Ko Chang.

Samurai had the right to strike with sword at anyone of a lower class who compromised their honour.Kirisute-gomen - Samurai World Etymology Kiri-sute gomen translates literally as \\"authorization to cut and leave [the body of the victim].\\"Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, Contrary to popular belief, this exact term didn't originate in the Edo period. The real name used in historical sources is either or .Mako Taniguchi, Kiri-sute Gomen, Yamakawa, 2005 Conditions Because the right was defined as a part of self defence, kiri-sute gomen had a set of tight rules. The strike had to follow immediately after the offence, meaning that the striker could not attack someone for a past grievance or after a substantial amount of time. Also, due to the right being self-defence, it was not permissible to deliver a further coup de gr√¢ce if a blow had been successfully applied. Anyone who was at the receiving end had the right to defend themselves by wakizashi, a situation most common in the case of a higher samurai exercising the right against a lower ranked samurai as those would always carry wakizashi. Some professions, like doctors and midwives, were not eligible targets for kiri-sute gomen while at work or heading to their workplaces, as their jobs often required them to push the boundaries of honor. This exception was called .Katsumi Nakae, Oedo no Bushi no Igaina Seikatsu Jijo - Ishokuj≈´ kara shumi shigoto made, 2005, PHP Bunko In any case, the samurai performing the act had to prove that his action was right. After striking down his victim, the user was required to notify it to a nearby government officer, give his version of the facts and provide at least one witness who corroborated it, and he was expected to spend the next 20 days at home as a proof of contrition. The last one applied even after favorable verdict, although it is unclear whether it applied to the physical author of the death or his superior in case the kill was performed by proxy. Moreover, the homicidal weapon could be confiscated if an investigation was necessary or as a warning for a kill whose justification was feeble, and it was only given back after the 20 days. Performing kiri-sute gomen without justification was severely punished. The guilty party could be destituted from his job and could even be sentenced to death or forced to commit seppuku. His family would be affected too if his properties and titles were removed from his inheritance. History Samurai visiting Edo often did all they could to obtain favorable verdicts, as an unfavorable court decision there could be even considered an act of rebellion against the shogunate. It was usual that clan elders presented gifts to officials in order to secure their support, to the point it was said magistrates earned more through those bribes than through their own salaries. It was also advisable for a samurai to go out accompanied by servants and other clan members who could serve as witness if it was necessary. A popular incident tells how a commoner bumped into Saiheiji Tomo, treasurer of the Owari-Tokugawa family, and ignored him further when Tomo demanded him to apologize. Feeling merciful, the samurai offered the peasant his wakizashi so he had a chance to defend himself, but instead, the commoner decided to run away with his wakizashi, causing further dishonor. The incident resulted in Tomo being disowned from the Owari-Tokugawa clan. He later regained his honor by seeking out the commoner, collecting the wakizashi and killing the whole family.Mikito Ujiie, Edo Hantei Monogatari, Chukoshinsho, 1988 Another happening features a nobleman named Kuranosuke Toda, whose kago was shoved by a commoner trying to cross through. Toda's bodyguard demanded an apology, but the peasant insulted them instead. The samurai then threw him to the ground, but the peasant still started a shouting match. Watching it from his litter, Toda ordered the man to be cut down. After reporting the incident, the judges approved Toda's decision and did not condemn him.Shigeaki Asahi, Bunka Kagaku An instance of Kiri sute gomen is described in the story of the H≈çgy≈´ Jiz≈ç statue. A boy, whose father was killed by Kiri sute gomen, made 100 stone statues in later life, in Kumamoto.

A story of life, sorrow, and coming of age, Farewell, Babylon is at once a history lesson and an homage to Jewish Baghdad. First published in French in 1975 as, \\"Adieu, Babylone,\\" the novel was translated by Sheila Fischman and published in English in 1976. It is the first of a trilogy that follows protagonist Meir as he moves from Iraq, to France and finally to Canada, a personal and professional trajectory that mirrors the author‚Äôs own. The work narrates a series of scenes, not necessarily in chronological order, of the protagonist‚Äôs adolescence. Farewell, Babylon and Kattan himself are little known outside academic circles. However, the work is a critical read for anyone interested in the history, culture and politics of modern Iraq. While Farewell, Babylon could be considered historical literature, the main theme of the novel is coming- of- age.

In retribution, Barabas then goes on to poison her along with the whole of the nunnery, strangles an old friar (Barnadine) who tries to make him repent for his sins and then frames another friar (Jacomo) for the first friar's murder. After Ithamore falls in love with a prostitute who conspires with her criminal friend to blackmail and expose him (after Ithamore drunkenly tells them everything his master has done), Barabas poisons all three of them. When he is caught, he drinks \\"of poppy and cold mandrake juice\\" so that he will be left for dead, and then plots with the enemy Turks to besiege the city. When at last Barabas is nominated governor by his new allies, he switches sides to the Christians once again. Having devised a trap for the Turks' galley slaves and soldiers in which they will all be demolished by gunpowder, he then sets a trap for the Turkish prince himself and his men, hoping to boil them alive in a hidden cauldron. Just at the right moment, however, the former governor emerges and causes Barabas to fall into his own trap. The Christians and Turks agree to resolve their conflict without violence while Barabas curses them as he burns.  Discussion  = History of Elizabethan antisemitism = Jews had been officially banished from England in 1290 with the Edict of Expulsion, nearly 300 years before Marlowe's writing of The Jew of Malta. They were not openly readmitted to the country until the 1650s. Throughout the period, Jews continued to work and live in London, and it is suggested that, while they were not fully integrated into society, they were generally tolerated and free to go about their business, within their own circles. That said, Elizabethan audiences would generally have had little-to- no encounters with Jews or Judaism in their daily life. Lacking any actual interaction with Jews, English authors when choosing to write Jewish characters would often resort to dressing, voicing, and animating them in fictive ways that often incorporated anti-semitic tropes. These creations have been the subject of much debate. For instance, some argue that the English lack of Jews created portrayals different from those in other areas of the world, where Jews were not banished. These differences were, in turn, different from the differences of other marginalized groups: a kind of double difference marking Jews as exceptionally ostracized. Others, such as Anthony Julius, go so far as to claim that the depictions of Jews in this period placed England firmly as the leading nation for the creation of antisemitic tropes. Others still, temper this notion by saying that these images, while perhaps born in England, grew to maturity on mainland Europe. These tropes could also have contributed to the popularity of plays such as Marlowe's The Jew of Malta. In 1594 Roderigo L√≥pez, a Converso and doctor to Queen Elizabeth I, was accused of attempting to poison his mistress and put on trial for treason. Racial propaganda was a major element in his conviction, and his execution was celebrated throughout the country, coinciding with the reprisal of Marlowe's play at the Rose Theatre. = Antisemitism in The Jew of Malta = The Jew of Malta, given the time of its publication, its main character, and the significance of religion throughout the text, is often referenced in discussions about antisemitism. Some of the conversation around antisemitism in The Jew of Malta focuses on authorial intent, the question of whether or not Marlowe intended to promote antisemitism in his work, while other critics focus on how the work is perceived, either by its audience at the time or by modern audiences. A Marxist critique of The Jew of Malta suggests that Marlowe intended to utilize readily available antisemitic feelings in his audience in a way that made the Jews \\"incidental\\" to the social critique he offered. That is, he wished to use antisemitism as a rhetorical tool rather than advocating for it. In this, Marlowe failed, instead producing a work that is, because of its failure to \\"discredit\\" the sentiments it toys with, a propagator of antisemitism. Such rhetorical attempts \\"underestimated the irrationality... fixation...and persistence of anti-Semitism\\". Another viewpoint suggests that those who claim to see antisemitism in Marlowe's work often do so more because of what they think they know about the period in which they were written rather than what the texts themselves present. The author admits that certain of Barabas' features are troublesome vis-√†-vis antisemitism, such as his large and often-referenced nose, but suggests that such surface details are not important. If one looks past the surface, it is argued, the play can be seen as uniting all three religions it represents‚ÄîJudaism, Islam, and Christianity‚Äîby way of their mutual hypocrisy. These examples illustrate, though not fully, the breadth of opinions expressed on the subject.A portrait of Christopher Marlowe = Authorship = Complicating the accusations of Marlowe's antisemitism, there has been significant scholarly dissension about the authorial nature of the text of the play. These reactions range from suggesting that the text of the play is entirely by Marlowe, but that the beginning was distorted towards the end by the strictures and deadlines of a theater's demands, so that subsequent adaptations and manuscripts have significantly distorted the original text. In particular, observers believe the third, fourth and fifth acts to be written, at least partially, by someone else. Others disagree, pointing out that the steadily building climb of Barabas' sins, culminating with his death by his own plot, to be indicative of a consistent authorial presence. While the play was entered in the Stationers' Register on 17 May 1594, the earliest surviving edition was printed in 1633 by the bookseller Nicholas Vavasour, under the sponsorship of Thomas Heywood. This edition contains prologues and epilogues written by Heywood for a revival in that year. Heywood is also sometimes thought to have revised the play. Corruption and inconsistencies in the 1633 quarto, particularly in the third, fourth, and fifth acts, may be evidence of revision or alteration of the text.Bevington & Rasmussen, pp. xxviii‚Äìxxix. =The Merchant of Venice= Some critics have suggested that the play directly influenced Marlowe's contemporary, William Shakespeare, in the writing of his play The Merchant of Venice (written c. 1596‚Äì99). James Shapiro notes that both The Merchant of Venice and The Jew of Malta are works obsessed with the economics of their day, stemming from anxiety around new business practices in the theater, including the bonding of actors to companies. Such bonds would require actors to pay a hefty fee if they performed with other troupes or were otherwise unable to perform. In this way, greed becomes an allegory rather than a characteristic or stereotype. Others believe that the suggestion of imitation by Shakespeare of Marlowe is overblown, and that not only the two stories are very different, but the principal characters that are often compared, Shylock and Barabas, are themselves profoundly different. While critics debate whether or not The Jew of Malta was a direct influence, or merely a product of the contemporaneous society that they both were written in, it is noteworthy that Marlowe and Shakespeare were the only two British playwrights of their time to include a Jewish principal character in one of their plays. = Biblical punishment = At the end of the play, Barabas attempts to murder his erstwhile Turkish allies by tricking them into falling through a trap door into a hot cauldron in a pit. In the end, it is Barabas who falls into his own fiery pit and dies a violent death. The method by which Barabas dies has several specific Biblical overtones, and these connections have been acknowledged by scholars. In terms of the specifications for punishment dictated by the Old Testament, it matches the crime in Barabas' case: he is guilty of murder, fraud, and betrayal by a Jew. Secondarily, there is a frequent use in the Old Testament of a device where a perpetrator is ensnared in his own trap. An example of this includes Haman, in the story of Purim, being hanged on the very gallows he intended for the Jews he wished to murder.  Performance and reception  The Jew of Malta was an immediate success from its first recorded performance at the Rose Theatre in early 1592, when Edward Alleyn played the lead role. The play was subsequently presented by Alleyn's Lord Strange's Men seventeen times between 26 February 1592 and 1 February 1593. It was performed by Sussex's Men on 4 February 1594, and by a combination of Sussex's and Queen Elizabeth's Men on 3 and 8 April 1594. More than a dozen performances by the Admiral's Men occurred between May 1594 and June 1596. (The play apparently belonged to impresario Philip Henslowe, since the cited performances occurred when the companies mentioned were acting for Henslowe.) In 1601 Henslowe's diary notes payments to the Admiral's company for props for a revival of the play.Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 424‚Äì5. The play remained popular for the next fifty years, until England's theaters were closed in 1642. In the Caroline era, actor Richard Perkins was noted for his performances as Barabas when the play was revived in 1633 by Queen Henrietta's Men. The title page of the 1633 quarto refers to this revival, performed at the Cockpit Theatre.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 424. The play was revived by Edmund Kean at Drury Lane on 24 April 1818. The script of this performance included additions by S. Penley.Frederick Boas, Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953), p. 301 It was considered a successful production at the time. However, in an anonymous biography of Kean published seventeen years later, it suggests that the success of the production came from Kean's performance and his addition of a song to the role of Barabas, and that the play itself, on its own, was a failure. On 2 October 1993, Ian McDiarmid starred as Barabas in a BBC Radio 3 adaptation of the play directed by Michael Fox, with Ken Bones as Machevil and Ferneze, Kathryn Hunt as Abigail, Michael Grandage as Don Lodowick, Neal Swettenham as Don Mathias and Kieran Cunningham as Ithamore.

It runs roughly north-south and is the easternmost street in the original 1837 Hoddle Grid. Spring Street is famous as the traditional seat of the Government of Victoria, as well as being central to many of the state's major cultural institutions. The street's name is frequently used as a metonym to refer to the state's bureaucracy.Michael Bachelard Feeling the heat The Age, 25 July 2010 Spring Street is also notable for its impressive Victorian architecture, including Melbourne Parliament House, the Old Treasury Building, the Windsor Hotel (also known as Duchess of Spring Street) and the Princess Theatre. The street is thought to be named after Baron Thomas Spring Rice, Chancellor of the Exchequer under Lord Melbourne. An alternative theory is that the name is due to the golden wattle trees in full bloom during Richard Bourke's visit.  Geography  The street runs from Flinders Street in the south to Victoria Street and the Carlton Gardens in the north. Nicholson Street begins as an offshoot of Spring Street slightly south to its intersection with Lonsdale Street. Notable buildings Spring Street has a number of architecturally notable buildings and important gardens, with many featuring on the Victorian Heritage Register and/or National Trust of Australia. These include:The Old Treasury Building at duskThe Hotel Windsor viewed from Treasury Place = Victorian Heritage Register = Parliament House (1856) Old Treasury Building (1862) Treasury Gardens (1867) Gordon Reserve (1870) Hotel Windsor (1885) Princess Theatre (1886) Alcaston House (1929) an early apartment building designed by A&K; Henderson in the palazzo style to complement the wider area * Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (1935)Also classified by the National Trust = National Trust = Holy Name Sisters (1913) = Other Prominent Structures = Parliament railway station (1983) an underground railway station built for the City Loop * 1 Collins Street (1985) a post-modern tower by Denton Corker Marshall amongst the city's first to incorporate heritage buildings * Casselden Place (1992) a tall office building which is home to government offices * Shell House (1988) at the corner of Spring and Flinders Street is a notable granite clad office tower designed by Harry Seidler in a similar style to his buildings in Sydney and Brisbane. The building's floor plates are in the shape of a shell as it was the Australian Head Office of Royal Dutch Shell. Parks and gardens Spring Street forms the western border of the Treasury Gardens. Gordon Reserve, a small triangle of parkland featuring heritage listed statues, is also located on Spring Street. Another small Chinese garden, known as the Tianjin Garden, is also located at the northern end of Spring Street. It is a symbol of Melbourne's close friendship with its sister city, Tianjin, China. Transport Tram tracks, taxis and cars on Spring StreetA number of tram routes run along Spring Street for all or part of its length, including the City Circle Tram, route 48 and route 96. Parliament railway station, connecting to most suburban Melbourne train lines as part of the underground City Loop, lies directly beneath and parallel to Spring Street.

In addition to rock samples, drilling technology can unearth samples of connate fluids and of the subsurface biosphere, mostly microbial life, preserved in drilled samples. Most of the technology used for drilling come from advances in the oil and gas industry. Scientific drilling is carried out on land by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) and at sea by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP). Scientific drilling on the continents includes drilling down into solid ground as well as drilling from small boats on lakes. Sampling thick glaciers and ice sheets to obtain ice cores is related but will not be described further here. Like probes sent into outer space, scientific drilling is a technology used to obtain samples from places that people cannot reach. Human beings have descended as deep as 2,212 m (7,257 ft) in Veryovkina Cave, the world's deepest known cave, located in the Caucasus mountains of the country of Georgia. Gold miners in South Africa regularly go deeper than 3,400 m, but no human has ever descended to greater depths than this below the Earth's solid surface. As depth increases into the Earth, temperature and pressure rise. Temperatures in the crust increase about 15 ¬∞C per kilometer, making it impossible for humans to exist at depths greater than several kilometers, even if it was somehow possible to keep shafts open in spite of the tremendous pressure. Scientific drilling is interdisciplinary and international in scope. Individual scientists cannot generally undertake scientific drilling projects alone. Teamwork between scientists, engineers, and administrators is often required for success in planning and in carrying out a drilling project, analyzing the samples, and interpreting and publishing the results in scientific journals. Purposes Scientific drilling is used to address a wide range of problems, which cannot be addressed using rocks exposed on the surface or the seafloor. The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program has a broad set of research objectives, which can be divided into three principal themes: #The nature of the deep biosphere and the oceanic sub- seafloor #Understanding environmental change, processes and effects #Cycles and geodynamics of the solid Earth ICDP focuses on scientific drilling to address the following questions about the history, chemistry, and physics of Earth and the biosphere: #What are the physical and chemical processes responsible for earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and what are the best ways to minimize their effects? #How has Earth's climate changed in the recent past and what are the reasons for such changes? #What have been the effects of meteorite impacts (bolides) on climate and mass extinctions of life? #What is the nature of the deep biosphere and its relation to geologic processes such as hydrocarbon maturation, ore deposition and evolution of life on Earth? #What are the ways to safely dispose of radioactive and other toxic waste materials? #How do sedimentary basins and fossil fuel resources originate and evolve? #How do mineral, and metal ore deposits form? #What are the fundamental physics of plate tectonics and heat, mass, and fluid transfer through Earth's crust? #How can people better interpret geophysical data used to determine the structure and properties of Earth's crust? ibuki mioda Deepest drillings The Kola Superdeep Borehole on the Kola peninsula of Russia reached and is the deepest penetration of the Earth's solid surface. The German Continental Deep Drilling Program at has shown the earth crust to be mostly porous. Drillings as deep as into the seafloor were achieved at DSDP/ODP/IODP Hole 504B. Because the continental crust is about 45 km thick on average, whereas oceanic crust is 6‚Äì7 km thick, deep drillings have penetrated only the upper 25-30% of both crusts. Riserless and mudlift drilling Ocean drilling The drillship that has been used for the past 20 and more years, the JOIDES Resolution, drills without a riser. Riser-less drilling uses seawater as its primary drilling fluid, which is pumped down through the drill pipe. This cleans and cools the drill bit and lifts cuttings out of the hole, piling them in a cone around the hole. Japan's new drillship, the Chikyu, uses a riser for drilling. The riser system includes an outer casing that surrounds the drill pipe, to provide return-circulation of drilling fluid for maintaining pressure balance within the borehole. A blowout preventer (BOP) protects the vessel and the environment from any unexpected release of gas and oil. This technology is necessary for drilling several thousand meters into the Earth and for drilling into thick sediments where oil and gas might reside.

The western part was in the parish of Tooting and part of the Seely estate, comprising and . Part of the estate adjacent to Tooting Junction Railway Station became available in 1892 and was developed as the Furzedown golf course, designed by Tom Dunn. The Seely estate was sold at the beginning of the twentieth century and the golf club moved to South Lodge, Mitcham Common in 1906. The roads in this part of Furzedown were mainly laid out between 1900 and 1930, covering the former golf course after sale of the estate. Furzedown House., dating from 1794 and enlarged with conservatory and single-storey entrance lodge in the early 1860s, was saved and converted to a teacher training college by London County Council in 1915.

The light coming from the diner illuminates a darkened and deserted urban streetscape. It has been described as Hopper's best-known workIan Chilvers and Harold Osborne (Eds.), The Oxford Dictionary of Art Oxford University Press, 1997 (second edition), p. 273, \\"The central theme of his work is the loneliness of city life, generally expressed through one or two figures in a spare setting - his best-known work, Nighthawks, has an unusually large 'cast' with four.\\" and is one of the most recognizable paintings in American art.Hopper's Nighthawks, Smarthistory video, accessed April 29, 2013. Within months of its completion, it was sold to the Art Institute of Chicago on May 13, 1942, for $3,000.The sale was recorded by Josephine Hopper as follows, in volume II, p. 95 of her and Edward's journal of his art: \\"May 13, '42: Chicago Art Institute - 3,000 + return of Compartment C in exchange as part payment. 1,000 - 1/3 = 2,000.\\" See Deborah Lyons, Edward Hopper: A Journal of His Work. New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1997, p. 63. About the painting \\"Nighthawks\\" in the Art Institute of Chicago It has been suggested that Hopper was inspired by a short story of Ernest Hemingway's, either \\"The Killers\\", which Hopper greatly admired,Gail Levin in \\"Interview with Gail Levin\\" or from the more philosophical \\"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place\\".Wagstaff 2004, p. 44 In keeping with the title of his painting, Hopper later said, Nighthawks has more to do with the possibility of predators in the night than with loneliness.Levin 1995, p. 350 =Josephine Hopper's notes on the painting= Starting shortly after their marriage in 1924, Edward Hopper and his wife Josephine (Jo) kept a journal in which he would, using a pencil, make a sketch-drawing of each of his paintings, along with a precise description of certain technical details. Jo Hopper would then add additional information about the theme of the painting. A review of the page on which Nighthawks is entered shows (in Edward Hopper's handwriting) that the intended name of the work was actually Night Hawks and that the painting was completed on January 21, 1942. Jo's handwritten notes about the painting give considerably more detail, including the possibility that the painting's title may have had its origins as a reference to the beak-shaped nose of the man at the bar, or that the appearance of one of the \\"nighthawks\\" was tweaked in order to relate to the original meaning of the word: In January 1942, Jo confirmed her preference for the name. In a letter to Edward's sister Marion she wrote, \\"Ed has just finished a very fine picturea lunch counter at night with 3 figures. Night Hawks would be a fine name for it. E. posed for the two men in a mirror and I for the girl. He was about a month and half working on it.\\"Jo Hopper, in letter to Marion Hopper, January 22, 1942. Quoted in Gail Levin, Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography. New York: Rizzoli, 2007, p. 349. Ownership history Invoice showing $1,971 going to the artist after commission and costs Upon completing the canvas in the late winter of 1941/42, Hopper placed it on display at Rehn's, the gallery at which his paintings were normally placed for sale. It remained there for about a month. On St. Patrick's Day, Edward and Jo Hopper attended the opening of an exhibit of the paintings of Henri Rousseau at the Museum of Modern Art, which had been organized by Daniel Catton Rich, the director of the Art Institute of Chicago. Rich was in attendance, along with Alfred Barr, the director of the Museum of Modern Art. Barr spoke enthusiastically of Gas, which Hopper had painted a year earlier, and \\"Jo told him he just had to go to Rehn's to see Nighthawks. In the event it was Rich who went, pronounced Nighthawks 'fine as a Homer', and soon arranged its purchase for Chicago.\\"Gail Levin, Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography. New York: Rizzoli, 2007, pp. 351-2, citing Jo Hopper's diary entry for March 17, 1942. The sale price was $3,000. Location of the restaurant The scene was supposedly inspired by a diner (since demolished) in Greenwich Village, Hopper's neighborhood in Manhattan. Hopper himself said the painting \\"was suggested by a restaurant on Greenwich Avenue where two streets meet\\". Additionally, he noted that \\"I simplified the scene a great deal and made the restaurant bigger\\".Hopper, interview with Katharine Kuh, in The Artist's Voice: Talks with Seventeen Modern Artists. 1962. Reprinted, New York: Da Capo Press, 2000, p. 134. That reference has led Hopper aficionados to engage in a search for the location of the original diner. The inspiration for the search has been summed up in the blog of one of these searchers: \\"I am finding it extremely difficult to let go of the notion that the Nighthawks diner was a real diner, and not a total composite built of grocery stores, hamburger joints, and bakeries all cobbled together in the painter's imagination\\". A Bickford's Restaurant a few blocks from Greenwich Avenue has been proposed as one possible location.\\" The spot usually associated with the former location is a now-vacant lot known as Mulry Square, at the intersection of Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Avenue, and West 11th Street, about seven blocks west of Hopper's studio on Washington Square. However, according to an article by Jeremiah Moss in The New York Times, that cannot be the location of the diner which inspired the painting, because a gas station occupied that lot from the 1930s to the 1970s. Moss located a land-use map in a 1950s municipal atlas showing that \\"Sometime between the late '30s and early '50s, a new diner appeared near Mulry Square\\". Specifically, the diner was located immediately to the right of the gas station, \\"not in the empty northern lot, but on the southwest side, where Perry Street slants\\". That map is not reproduced in the Times article but is shown on Moss's blog. Moss comes to the conclusion that Hopper should be taken at his word: the painting was merely \\"suggested\\" by a real-life restaurant, he had \\"simplified the scene a great deal\\", and he \\"made the restaurant bigger\\". In short, there probably never was a single real-life scene identical to the one that Hopper had created, and if one did exist, there is no longer sufficient evidence to pin down the precise location. Moss concludes, \\"the ultimate truth remains bitterly out of reach\\". In popular culture Roger Brown's Puerto Rican Wedding (1969). Brown said that the caf√© in the lower left corner of this painting \\"isn't set up like an imitation of Nighthawks, but still refers to it very much.\\"Levin, 111‚Äì112. Because it is so widely recognized, the diner scene in Nighthawks has served as the model for many homages and parodies. =Painting and sculpture= Many artists have produced works that allude or respond to Nighthawks. Hopper influenced the Photorealists of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Ralph Goings, who evoked Nighthawks in several paintings of diners. Richard Estes painted a corner store in People's Flowers (1971), but in daylight, with the shop's large window reflecting the street and sky. More direct visual quotations began to appear in the 1970s. Gottfried Helnwein's painting Boulevard of Broken Dreams (1984) replaces the three patrons with American pop culture icons Humphrey Bogart, Marilyn Monroe, and James Dean, and the attendant with Elvis Presley. According to Hopper scholar Gail Levin, Helnwein connected the bleak mood of Nighthawks with 1950s American cinema and with \\"the tragic fate of the decade's best-loved celebrities.\\"Levin, 109‚Äì110. Nighthawks Revisited, a 1980 parody by Red Grooms, clutters the street scene with pedestrians, cats, and trash.Levin, 116‚Äì123. A 2005 Banksy parody shows a fat, shirtless soccer hooligan in Union Flag boxers standing inebriated outside the diner, apparently having just smashed the diner window with a nearby chair. A large mural recreation of Nighthawks was painted on a defunct Chinese restaurant in Santa Rosa, California until the building was demolished in 2019. =Literature= Several writers have explored how the customers in Nighthawks came to be in a diner at night, or what will happen next. Wolf Wondratschek's poem \\"Nighthawks: After Edward Hopper's Painting\\" imagines the man and woman sitting together in the diner as an estranged couple: \\"I bet she wrote him a letter/ Whatever it said, he's no longer the man / Who'd read her letters twice.\\"Gem√ºnden, 2‚Äì5, 15; quotation translated from the German by Gem√ºnden. Joyce Carol Oates wrote interior monologues for the figures in the painting in her poem \\"Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, 1942\\".. The Oates poem appears in the anthology A special issue of Der Spiegel included five brief dramatizations that built five different plots around the painting; one, by screenwriter Christof Schlingensief, turned the scene into a chainsaw massacre. Erik Jendresen and Stuart Dybek also wrote short stories inspired by this painting.Gem√ºnden, 5‚Äì6. =Film= Hopper was an avid moviegoer and critics have noted the resemblance of his paintings to film stills. Nighthawks and works such as Night Shadows (1921) anticipate the look of film noir, whose development Hopper may have influenced. Hopper was an acknowledged influence on the film musical Pennies from Heaven (1981), for which production designer Ken Adam recreated Nighthawks as a set.Doss, 36. Director Wim Wenders recreated Nighthawks as the set for a film-within-a-film in The End of Violence (1997). Wenders suggested that Hopper's paintings appeal to filmmakers because \\"You can always tell where the camera is.\\" In Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), two characters visit a caf√© resembling the diner in a scene that illustrates their solitude and despair. The painting was also briefly used as a background for a scene in the animated film Heavy Traffic (1973) by director Ralph Bakshi. Nighthawks also influenced the \\"future noir\\" look of Blade Runner; director Ridley Scott said \\"I was constantly waving a reproduction of this painting under the noses of the production team to illustrate the look and mood I was after\\". In his review of the 1998 film Dark City, Roger Ebert noted that the film had \\"store windows that owe something to Edward Hopper's Nighthawks.\\" Hard Candy (2005) acknowledged a similar debt by setting one scene at a \\"Nighthawks Diner\\" where a character purchases a T-shirt with Nighthawks printed on it. =Music=Tom Waits's album Nighthawks at the Diner (1975) features a title, a cover, and lyrics inspired by Nighthawks.Thiesen, 10; Reynolds, E25. *The video for Voice of the Beehive's song \\"Monsters and Angels\\", from Honey Lingers, is set in a diner reminiscent of the one in Nighthawks, with the band-members portraying waitstaff and patrons. The band's web site said they \\"went with Edward Hopper's classic painting, Nighthawks, as a visual guide.\\" *Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's 2013 single \\"Night Caf√©\\" was influenced by Nighthawks and mentions Hopper by name. Seven of his paintings are referenced in the lyrics. =Theatre and opera= Jonathan Miller's 1982 production of Verdi's opera Rigoletto for English National Opera, set in 1950s New York, designed by Patrick Robertson and Rosemary Vercoe, features one street setting with a bar inspired by the Nighthawks diner. =Television= An establishing shot from \\"Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment\\", one of several references to Nighthawks in the animated TV series The Simpsons * The television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation placed its characters in a version of the painting. * The television show Fresh Off the Boat Season 2 poster features the title family in Nighthawks with actress Constance Wu using chopsticks. *The closing scene of the Turner Classic Movies (TCM) ‚ÄúOpen All Night‚Äù promo is based on Nighthawks. =Scale model= A number of model railroaders, most notably John Armstrong, have recreated the scene on their layouts. The theater lighting manufacturer Electronic Theatre Controls has a human sized scale model of the diner in the lobby of their headquarters in Middleton, Wisconsin. It is used as a reception area for the building.\\"Secrets of ETC‚Äôs Town Square\\". Et Cetera, Electronic Theatre Controls. Retrieved October 9, 2018. =Parodies= Nighthawks has been widely referenced and parodied in popular culture. Versions of it have appeared on posters, T-shirts and greeting cards as well as in comic books and advertisements.Levin, 125‚Äì126. Typically, these parodies‚Äîlike Helnwein's Boulevard of Broken Dreams, which became a popular poster‚Äîretain the diner and the highly recognizable diagonal composition but replace the patrons and attendant with other characters: animals, Santa Claus and his reindeer, or the respective casts of The Adventures of Tintin or Peanuts.Levin, 125‚Äì126; Thiesen, 10. One parody of Nighthawks even inspired a parody of its own. Michael Bedard's painting Window Shopping (1989), part of his Sitting Ducks series of posters, replaces the figures in the diner with ducks and shows a crocodile outside eying the ducks in anticipation. Poverino Peppino parodied this image in Boulevard of Broken Ducks (1993), in which a contented crocodile lies on the counter while four ducks stand outside in the rain.

Like the other Ancient Church Orders, the Apostolic Canons use a pseudepigraphic form. These eighty-five canons were approved by the Eastern Council in Trullo in 692 but rejected by Pope Sergius I. In the Western Church only fifty of these canons circulated, translated in Latin by Dionysius Exiguus in about 500 AD, and included in the Western collections and afterwards in the \\"Corpus Juris Canonici\\". Canon n. 85 contains a list of canonical books, thus it is important for the history of the Biblical canon. Content They deal mostly with the office and duties of a Christian bishop, the qualifications and conduct of the clergy, the religious life of the Christian flock (abstinence, fasting), its external administration (excommunication, synods, relations with pagans and Jews), the sacraments (Baptism, Eucharist, Marriage); in a word, they are a handy summary of the statutory legislation of the Early Church. The last of these decrees contains a very important list or canon of the Holy Scriptures. In the original Koine Greek text they claim to be the very legislation of the Apostles themselves, as promulgated by what was then known as the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Christian Church. The notion that they could not be directly apostolic in origin is a common theme among post- Reformation Christians. However, the Eastern Orthodox Church holds them in high regard, and believes in their divine inspiration as passed down from the nascent times of the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church i.e. beginning with the preachings of Jesus Christ and as promulgated in the early church by the Apostles and their disciples. Some, like Beveridge and Hefele, believe that they were originally drawn up about the end of the second or the beginning of the 3rd century. Most modern critics agree that they could not have been composed before the Council of Antioch of 341, some twenty of whose canons they quote; nor even before the latter end of the 4th century, since they are certainly posterior to the Apostolic Constitutions. Franz Xaver von Funk, admittedly a foremost authority on the latter and all similar early canonical texts, locates the composition of the Apostolic Canons in the 5th century, near the year 400. Thereby he approaches the opinion of his scholarly predecessor, Johann Sebastian Drey, the first among modern writers to study profoundly these ancient canons; he distinguished two editions of them, a shorter one (fifty) about the middle of the 5th century, and a longer one (eighty-five) early in the 6th century. Von Funk admits but one edition. They were certainly current in the Eastern Church in the first quarter of the 6th century, for about 520 Severus of Antioch quotes canons 21-23. For various opinions concerning the date of composition see and the new French translation of Hefele's History of the Councils, Paris (1907). pp. 1206-11 History The home of the author seems to be Syria. He makes use of the Syro-Macedonian calendar (can. 26), borrows very largely from a Syrian council (Antioch, 341), and according to Von Funk is identical with the compiler or interpolator of the Apostolic Constitutions, who was certainly a Syrian. There is some controversy over the number of these canons. In the Apostolic Constitutions (loc. cit.) they are eighty-five (occasionally eighty-four, a variant in the Manuscripts that arises from the occasional counting of two canons as one). In the latter half of the 6th century, John of Antioch (Joannes Scholasticus), Patriarch of Constantinople from 565 to 577, published a collection of synodal decrees in which he included these eighty-five canons, and this number was finally consecrated for the Greek Church by the Trullan or Quinisext Council of 692, which stopped short of affirming their apostolic authorship, instead referring to them as having been handed down in the name of the Apostles. On the other hand, the Latin Church, throughout the Middle Ages, recognized only fifty canons of the Apostles. This was the number finally adopted by Dionysius Exiguus, who first translated these canons into Latin about 500. It is not very clear why he omitted canons 51-85; he seems to have been acquainted with them and to have used the Apostolic Constitutions. Dionysius made three versions of the Apostolic Canons; it is the second of these versions which obtained general European currency by its incorporation as the opening text of his famous Latin collection of canons (both synodal decrees and papal decretals) known as the Dionysiana Collectio, made public in the first decade of the 6th century. Later collections of canons (Italy, Spain, France, Germany, etc.) borrowed from him; the text passed into Pseudo-Isidore, and eventually Gratian included (c. 1140) some excerpts from these canons in his Decretum, whereby a universal recognition and use were gained for them in the law schools. At a much earlier date Justinian (in his Sixth Novel) had recognized them as the work of the Apostles and confirmed them as ecclesiastical law.For the Western references in the early Middle Ages see , and for their insertion in the early Western collections of canons, see Nevertheless, from their first appearance in the West they aroused suspicion. Canon 46 for example, that rejected all heretical baptism, was notoriously opposed to Roman and Western practice. In the so-called Decretum of Pope Gelasius (492-96) they are denounced as an apocryphal book, i. e. not recognized by the Catholic Church, though this note of censure was probably not in the original Decretum, but with others was added under Pope Hormisdas (514-23). Consequently, in a second edition (lost, except preface) of his Collectio canonum, prepared under the latter pope, Dionysius Exiguus omitted them; even in the first edition he admitted that very many in the West were loath to acknowledge them (quamplurimi quidem assensum non pr≈ìbuere facilem). Hincmar of Reims (died 882) declared that they were not written by the Apostles, and as late as the middle of the 11th century, Western theologians (Cardinal Humbert, 1054) distinguished between the eighty-five Greek canons that they declared apocryphal, and the fifty Latin canons recognized as orthodox rules by antiquity. Influence The influence of the Apostolic Canons was greatly increased by the various versions of them soon current in the Christian Church, East and West. They were also translated (more or less fully) into Syriac, Arabic, Coptic, and Armenian; in general they seem to have furnished during the 5th and 6th centuries a large element of the ecclesiastical legislation in the Eastern Church. The manuscripts of the (Greek) Apostolic Canons are described by Pitra; the manuscripts of the Latin versions of Dionysius Exiguus, by C. H. Turner. The fifty Latin canons were first printed in Jacques Merlin's edition of the Councils (Paris, 1524); the eighty-five Greek Canons by G. Holoander, in his edition of Justinian's Novels (Nuremberg, 1531), whence they made their way into the earlier editions of the Corpus Juris Civilis, the Corpus Juris Canonici, and the large collections of acts and decrees of the councils. Other ancient Canons A few other ancient canonical texts that claim Apostolic origin are described by F. Nau; the most interesting of them is a brief collection of nine canons that purport to date from an Apostolic Council of Antioch (see Council of Jerusalem). They may be read in Pitra, Hist. et monumenta Juris eccl. Gr√¶corum (Rome, 1864), I, 88-91; also in Lagarde, Reliqui√¶ juris eccl. antiquissim√¶ gr√¶ce, 18-20, and in Harnack, Mission und Ausbreitung (Leipzig, 1902). They recommend the faithful not to practice circumcision, to admit the Gentiles, to avoid Jewish and pagan customs, the distinction of clean and unclean foods, the worship of idols, the vices of avarice and gluttony, frequentation of theatres, and taking of oaths. The earliest Christian literature offers numerous parallels to the content of these canons, which, in general, recall the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistle of Barnabas, and the Didache. In the 16th century the Jesuit Turrianus (Francisco Torres) defended their authenticity, his chief argument being a reference of Pope Innocent I (401-17) to an Apostolic Council of Antioch (Mansi, III, 1055). A notable literary controversy followed that is not yet quite closed. Interest centres chiefly in the first canon, which decrees that the Galileans shall henceforth be called Christians (see Acts 11:26), a holy people, a royal priesthood (see 1 Peter 2:9) according to the grace and title of baptism. Some critics see in this canon a defiant reply to the contemptuous use of Galileans by the 4th century Julian the Apostate (Harnack, Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums, Leipzig, 1902; Paul Lejay, in Revue du clerg√© fran√ßais, 15 Oct., 1903, 349-55, with a Fr. tr. of the nine canons). Nau is of the opinion that they are much older than the latter quarter of the 4th century and calls attention to Origen of Alexandrias writings  \\"it seemed good to the Apostles and the elders assembled at Antioch, and in their own words to the Holy Spirit to write a letter to the Gentiles who believed\\". in This statement contradicts Acts, xv, 6, 23, 28, according to which the Apostolic letter was written from the Council of Jerusalem. Nevertheless, it seems that this collection of canons was known to Origen, all the more as it claims (in the title) to come from the library of Origen at C√¶sarea and to have been found there by the martyr Pamphilus. Nau thinks that they may represent a personal rule of conduct drawn up by some 2nd-century Christian (on the basis of Apostolic precepts) who miscopied Acts, xi, 26, into the form of the afore-mentioned canon 1, and then added the other precepts ‚Äî canon 9 reproduces the decree of Acts, xv, 29. Dall√¶us (Daill√©) charged Turrianus with downright forgery of all these canons, and deliberate corruption of the text of Ps. xvi, 14, \\"they are full of children\\" (hyion), making it read hyieon ‚Äî i. e. \\"they are filled with pork\\". This reading of the fifth canon of Antioch is found not only in the oldest Latin Psalters, and in other reliable fourth to 6th century Latin witnesses to the Scripture-text, but also in the best Greek manuscripts (Codex Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, manuscripts dated by scholars to the 4th century). In other words, the Scripture-text used by these canons postdates Origen (who lived at the end of the second through the middle of the 3rd century). This is evidence of their great antiquity or deceptive recycling by some medieval forger.

She was one of the Federal ships to pursue during the Confederate steamer‚Äôs daring attempt to race down the Mississippi River and escape to sea. Following duty off Mobile, Ossipee sailed North late in June and decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 3 July. =Pacific, 1866‚Äì1872= Recommissioned 27 October 1866, Captain George F. Emmons in command, Ossipee served in the north Pacific protecting American interests along the coasts of Mexico and Central America. She departed San Francisco 27 September 1867 for Sitka, Alaska, carrying Russian Commissioners for the ceremony transferring Alaska to the United States on 18 October. After serving in the Pacific into the spring of 1872, Ossipee headed home on 6 June. On 20 June, Seaman James Benson jumped overboard to rescue a shipmate, for which he was later awarded the Medal of Honor. Ossipee arrived in New York on 18 November, and was decommissioned there on the 30th. =North Atlantic, 1873‚Äì1878= Recommissioned 10 October 1873, the veteran sloop of war served in the North Atlantic. She departed Key West 15 December for Dry Tortugas to await filibustering steamer Virginius which had been seized on the high seas by the under fraudulent American registry. To help ease tension caused by the Virginius Affair, Spain had turned the prize over to the United States, represented by Captain Whiting, commander of at Bahia Honda, Cuba. Despatch took Virginius to Tortugas. Ossipee departed Tortugas 19 December towing Virginius north, but the notorious prize foundered off Cape Hatteras a week later. Ossipee continued operations in the North Atlantic until decommissioning at Boston 25 May 1878. =Asiatic Squadron, Atlantic, 1884‚Äì1891= Recommissioned 28 January 1884, Ossipee departed Hampton Roads 30 April for the Far East via Gibraltar and the Suez Canal and served on the Asiatic station until returning to New York 15 February 1887. She then served along the Atlantic coast and in the West Indies until decommissioning at Norfolk, Virginia 12 November 1889. She was sold there 25 March 1891 to Herbert H. Ives.

It was the fourth album produced by Vangelis in Nemo Studios, London, and his final album for RCA Records. It is an avant-garde- experimental album. Overview It is a concept album inspired by the architecture of the homonymous complex area, specifically Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. He visited the area in 1977, and recalls \\"I was very impressed. I returned to London and I recorded my album Beaubourg quickly, spontaneously. So I 'felt' Beaubourg, but that does not mean that Beaubourg is only this: I can redo Beaubourg in 30 different ways\\". The recording took him less than a month. Vangelis noted that many people in the beginning had difficulty listening to it, but later appreciated it. He said it can be played in the background. Vangelis expressed that he \\"needed courage to release this record\\" as RCA \\"has not believed in any of my four albums\\", or in his artistic activity, and he was \\"accused of purposely recording a disc of very ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô electronic music\\"; nevertheless the album sold well. Thus he decided to leave RCA for Polydor Records. Its release was promoted with a live appearance by Vangelis at the Pavillon de Paris on June 19, 1978. Release In 2013 the album was released in remastered and reissued digipak edition by Esoteric Recordings. Instrumentation The music on the album was primarily improvised on one or more Yamaha CS-80, and the ring modulator, which transforms simple tones into complex noises, was extensively used. Composition It is entirely synthesizer-based and highly experimental and abstract; together with Hypothesis (recorded in 1971 and unofficially released in 1978) it is often considered to be one of Vangelis' least accessible works. It's musically expressive, with dramatic transformations of tonality, with short melodies which suddenly drift into distorted noises. Reception Steve McDonald of Allmusic noted that the album is a \\"difficult listening\\" due to its style and \\"great dark synthesized tone poem\\". Henri Stirk from Background Magazine similarly rated the 2013 edition by Esoteric Recordings with 2/5 stars.

Its distinguishing feature is a pier in Sandy Hook Bay where ammunition can be loaded and unloaded from warships at a safe distance from heavily populated areas. The station is divided into two sections: Mainside, located in parts of Colts Neck Township, Howell Township, Wall Township, and Tinton Falls at ; and the Waterfront Area (which includes the pier complex), on Sandy Hook Bay, located in the Leonardo section of Middletown Township, at . The areas are connected by Normandy Road, a military road and rail line. History World War II operations demanded an ammunition depot near the greater New York metropolitan area but away from high-population sectors. Planning was hastened in early 1943 after the ammunition ship SS El Estero caught fire while moored in Bayonne, New Jersey. If the stowed and dockside explosives had detonated at once, in the manner of the great Halifax Explosion, the blast could have damaged parts of Bayonne and even Lower Manhattan. A board was established to locate a suitable site, and chose Sandy Hook Bay, which featured a safe, sheltered, and nearby port where ships could take on ammunition. Rail lines could bring in the ammunition from the west, where the majority of ammunition shipments originated. The rural area meant few local residents would be affected. On August 2, 1943, construction began on Naval Ammunition Depot Earle, named after Rear Admiral Ralph Earle, the chief of the Bureau of Ordnance during World War I. The depot was commissioned on December 13, 1943, though work continued on the military road and railway connecting the mainside complex, the waterfront complex and the pier, which stretches into the Sandy Hook Bay. Earle continued to develop after World War II, keeping pace with the changing needs of the navy. In 1974, the depot's name was changed to Naval Weapons Station Earle. School-aged children of active military personnel at the station in grades K through 8 attend the schools of the Tinton Falls School District. Students in grades 9 through 12 attend Monmouth Regional High School in Tinton Falls, part of the Monmouth Regional High School District.

This included especially a literal reading of the Book of Revelation, a minority position at the time.  Extant portions  The Book of Nepos no longer exists, and is known only indirectly through Eusebius, who quoted a work by Dionysius of Alexandria criticizing Nepos.Nepos of Arsino√´, New Catholic Encyclopedia, (2003).  Theology and reception  Nepos was a strict literalist (believing the entire Bible is true in a literal sense). His text, also known as the Refutation of the Allegorisers or Refutation of the Allegorists was aimed at refuting the arguments of those who held that certain sections of the Bible were mere allegory.Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, Book VII, Chapter XXIV 1-2. In particular, the text is aimed at discrediting the position, held by a minority of Christians at the time, that the book of Revelation should be interpreted allegorically rather than literally. Amongst the teachings in the text is the belief that Jesus would come to earth and physically reign as monarch for 1000 years during an age of righteous delight. This belief was regarded as fairly orthodox in the early church (e.g. it was held by Irenaeus, and Justin Martyr), however, the later church came to view Revelation as more allegorical. The dispute with Nepos, as found in Eusebius is in fact, the first instance of premillennialism ever being refuted. Dionysius of Alexandria felt moved to write a text (On the Promises) against it, although he regarded Nepos highly and attempted to criticize the doctrine without insulting Nepos personally. The Book of Nepos was so popular within the villages around Alexandria that Dionysius went there in person to refute it.Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, Book VII, Chapter XXIV 3. In deference to Nepos and the prior orthodoxy of strict literalism, he did so politely, entering a respectful dialogue with those from the village and contesting each of the arguments they took from the Book of Nepos in turn. The refutation Dionysius offered was based on the notion that John was not the author of the Book of Revelation, popularly attributed to him. It was based on stylistic differences between the Gospels and epistles thought to be of John.Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, Book VII, Chapter XXV. Eusebius himself described the interpretation of Nepos as advocating that the Divine Scriptures be \\"understood in a more Jewish manner.\\"Eusebius'Chapter XXIV 1  References  3rd-century Christian texts Biblical commentaries Book of Revelation Books about hermeneutics Egyptian books Lost books Lost religious texts ","title":"Book of Nepos"},{"id":"1858312","text":"Lava is a heavy-duty hand cleaner in soap bar form manufactured by the WD-40 Company.

Coventry is associated with Northeast Ohio's artistic, musical, bohemian, hippie and emerging hipster communities and is the center of Cleveland's creative class, inviting comparisons to the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Greenwich Village in New York City, although on a smaller scale. History The road bisecting what is now Coventry Village appears in the map of Harris H. Blackmore of 1852 as an unidentified north-south route connecting the North Union Shaker Settlement, then near its peak of about 300 settlers, to what is now Mayfield Road. It was the eastern terminus of Cedar Road in the rural area then known as East Cleveland Township, separating it from Warrensville Township to the east. The road passed through farmland acquired by Worthy S. Streator located between Mayfield Road and Cedar Road who chose aptly to assuage his wife's growing misgivings over haunted farmland by turning the wartime burial gulley into a commercial area funded by the Shakers. By 1890 it was known as the North-South County Road, or Streator Road. That year, Patrick Calhoun, a lawyer visiting town on railroad business, spied the James A. Garfield Memorial in Lake View Cemetery from a bluff on Streator's farm. He immediately offered to purchase Streator's acreage surrounding Streator Road for $30,000, closing the purchase in 1891. Calhoun intended to develop acreage as part of an upscale planned community that he named \\"Euclid Heights\\". Calhoun intended Euclid Heights to be a New England-style upper-income community of Protestants of Anglo-Saxon heritage. By 1892 the road was identified as Coventry Road in George F. Cram & Company's atlas of that year. The part of East Cleveland Township now known as Cleveland Heights became a hamlet in 1901, and then a village in 1903. As demand for large houses declined in the coming decades, and Calhoun's realty company became insolvent in the 1910s, unbuilt lots in the portion of Euclid Heights near Coventry Road were sold at foreclosure sales. Developers built apartment buildings on these empty lots. The Euclid Heights and Mayfield streetcar routes met at the Coventry‚ÄìMayfield intersection, making the area a convenient commuter transfer point after 1907. Most of the buildings on Coventry were constructed between 1913 and 1933, with the greatest growth occurring between 1921 and 1925, when 18 commercial buildings were erected. Buildings erected for retail walk-in traffic typically included second story apartments, to maximize the benefits of urbanization and rapid population growth. The new Coventry business district served streetcar passengers and the increasing populations of the Euclid Heights and Mayfield Heights developments. Before then, the nearest commercial center was at Doan's Corners. By the early 1920s, the newly built apartment district attracted a large, thriving Jewish community. This influence was reflected in the commercial district by, among other things, a kosher poultry slaughterhouse. In 1921, Cleveland Heights attained cityhood. The motion picture Les Amants (\\"The Lovers\\") was first shown locally in 1959 at the Heights Art Theatre, then located at the intersection of Coventry Road and Euclid Heights Boulevard. Theater manager Nico Jacobellis was arrested and convicted on obscenity charges for showing the film. By its decision in Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184 (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction. Agreeing that Jacobellis' criminal conviction was improper and that the film was not obscene, Justice Potter Stewart famously described his perspective on obscene material: \\"I know it when I see it...\\" The U.S. Supreme Court diminished the importance of Jacobellis by decisions it entered years later, yet \\"I know it when I see it\\" remains one of the best-remembered quotations in its history. A street sign acknowledges Coventry's recent history. In the second half of the 1960s, Coventry became the gathering place for Cleveland's counterculture, owing partly to the popularity of the C-Saw Caf√© with bikers, and to the area's proximity to John Carroll University and the predecessor schools to Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland State University. As one writer explains, this transition was sudden: \\"In addition to the problems facing aging communities everywhere...the Jewish community of Cleveland Heights faced two additional problems at the end of the 1960s: the dramatic takeover of a small area of the city by hippies and motorcyclists, and the quickening pace of integration....The counterculture flower children with long hair, health food, music, and, most significantly, drugs virtually took over [Coventry Village] during the second half of the 1960s. Hippies overflowed the Gothic apartments, cardboard \\"Store for Rent\\" signs seemed to be everywhere, and motorcycle groups (if not gangs) dotted the corners in the evening....[P]olice had begun to probe recurrent reports of drug use (marijuana and LSD) among Cleveland Heights High School students.\\" (citation and footnote forthcoming) Record Revolution, which opened in 1968 and continues to operate, became a destination for rock stars passing through Cleveland, and most of its famous customers autographed the store walls. Among them were members of Led Zeppelin, Genesis, Bad Company, The Who, Mott the Hoople, Bruce Springsteen, Southside Johnny, Hall & Oates, Brian Eno, the Psychedelic Furs, Deborah Harry of Blondie, and the Pixies. The staff hosted in-store album signings with then-breaking artists Lou Reed, Patti Smith, and Elvis Costello. In his book The Catalog of Cool (1982), rock critic Gene Sculatti called Record Revolution ‚Äúthe coolest place to buy records‚Äù in Ohio. In the 1970s, Record Revolution was one of the three \\"breakout\\" record stores in Greater Cleveland that affected radio play at the influential rock station WMMS. When WMMS management added to its playlist a new album or a new artist, particularly one on the cutting edge or left of center, an early indicator of success was sales at Record Revolution. To stay competitive, Record Revolution expanded its business model to retailing of clothing and paraphernalia euphemistically called \\"smoking accessories\\".Traiman, Steve, ‚ÄúRecord Revolution Sticks By Its Niche Cleveland-area Store Specializes in In die Releases,‚Äù Billboard, January 17, 1998.Gorman, John, ‚ÄúRemembering Peter Schliewen of Record Revolution,‚Äù The Buzzard (blog), June 14, 2009, retrieved July 2, 2009.

Founded as a rural village in 1838 on the banks of the Sturt River, Marion was found to have rich soil and the population expanded rapidly. Colonel William Light laid out the plan for the village, as he had done with the City of Adelaide itself. Marion is bordered on the north by Oaklands Road, on the east by Marion Road, on the south by Sturt Road and on the west by a roughly straight line from Finniss Street in the south to The Parade. History The township of Marion was laid out by William Light and B. T. Finniss in 1838, and was (mis)named for Marianne Fisher (1827‚Äì1927), daughter of the Resident Commissioner, James Hurtle Fisher. Vegetables, stone fruits, almonds and grapes were all produced in Marion. Richard Hamilton started the first vineyard in 1838 and his family continues its wine making tradition to this day. By the late 19th century Marion was also home to a number of industries such as a mining and brick making. However, the population at this time was still very small ‚Äì around 350 people. Gradually the Adelaide sprawl crept up to Marion, and by the 1950s the suburb was well and truly enveloped. :Much of the development was \\"austerity housing\\", basic 3- and 4-bedroom dwellings, unfinished and unfurnished, on bare quarter-acre (1000 m2m) blocks. Walls were of cavity construction: variously double brick or brick-Mount Gambier stone and roofs tiled, either cement or terracotta. The properties built for the South Australian Housing Trust and rented or sold at modest cost to working families, many being migrants from overseas or country areas who were attracted to Adelaide by newly developed industries. The tenants would then finish the house in their own time by painting, adding floor coverings and fitting curtains. Many would then add insulation, a garage, sheds, gardens, lawns, trees and so forth. :Many of these places remain, but are being overtaken by \\"infill\\" housing: two or three residences where there once was one.  Amenities  Parkland Marion is home to a number of parks and reserves. The large sporting complex off Sturt Road contains ovals and a basketball stadium. There are also parks on Norfolk Road, Tilley Crescent, Nicholas Road, Oakleigh Road, George Street and Alison Avenue. Marion also shares the Oaklands Reserve with Oaklands Park. The City of Marion Swimming Centre is situated adjacent to the suburb of Marion, in Park Holme. The Sturt River Linear Park is a trail which follows the Sturt River through the south-western metropolitan area from Marion to Glenelg.  Community facilities  The large co-educational private school, Westminster, is situated on Alison Avenue near the railway line. It caters to all grades from Reception to Year 12, and caters for boarders. Marion High School, situated on York Avenue, Clovelly Park, served the youth of the area for over forty years until its closure in 1996. The area has now been redeveloped primarily for housing, with just the school hall remaining; named Cosgrove Hall after a long-running headmaster of the school. Churches of various denominations are located Marion. The Marion Returned and Services League of Australia Club is located on Norfolk Road. There are two bowling clubs in the suburb of Marion, one on Norfolk Road, near the RSL club and another on Sturt Road adjacent to Sturt Oval. In April 2011 South Australian Premier Mike Rann opened the South Australia Aquatic and Leisure Centre on Morphett Road in Oaklands Park, the most advanced swimming and diving facilities in Australia. He was joined at the opening by Marion Mayor Felicity-Ann Lewis. Lewis and Rann had championed the project for some years to enable Olympic standard aquatic sports to occur in South Australia.ABC News, April 26, 2011  Governance  It is part of the City of Marion. The council offices for the whole city are located in nearby Sturt. Marion is split between the state electorates of Elder and Mitchell and is situated in the Federal Division of Boothby.  Transport  There is a railway station in Marion between Minchinbury Terrace and Fairne Terrace, which connects to Adelaide's centre to the north and Noarlunga to the south. There are two major bus routes serving the district: the M44 from Marion Shopping Centre which runs along Finniss Street and Marion Road to Adelaide's centre, then via the O-Bahn Busway to Golden Grove. The north of the suburb is served by the 241 bus from Marion Shopping Centre, which runs along Morphett Road, Oaklands Road and Daws Road to the city centre.

Archer must dig through a strange cast of Los Angeles characters, finding crime after crime before he can get to the job he was hired to do.

He was also successful in other genres: novel, essay, theater, diary and aphorism. In the year of his death, he was awarded the US$100,000 Premio Juan Rulfo de literatura latinoamericana y del Caribe. His work has been translated into numerous languages, including English. The characters in his stories, often autobiographical and usually written in simple but ironic language, tend to end up with their hopes cruelly dashed. But despite its apparent pessimism, Ribeyro's work is often comic, its humor springing from both the author's sense of irony and the accidents that befall his protagonists. A collection was published under the title La palabra del mudo (The Word of the Mute). Ribeyro studied literature and law in Universidad Cat√≥lica in Lima. In 1960 he immigrated to Paris where he worked as a journalist in France Presse and then as cultural advisor and ambassador to UNESCO. He was an avid smoker, as described in his short story ¬®S√≥lo para fumadores¬® (For smokers only), and he died as a result of his addiction. Biography Early years (1929‚Äì1952) Ribeyro was born in Lima on August 31, 1929. He was the son of Julio Ram√≥n Ribeyro Bonello and Mercedes Z√∫√±iga Rabines, the first of four children (two boys and two girls). His family was middle class, but in earlier generations had belonged to the upper class, counting among his ancestors some illustrious figures in Peruvian culture and politics, mostly of a conservative and \\"civilist\\" trend. In his childhood he lived in Santa Beatriz, a middle-class Lima neighborhood, and then moved to Miraflores, residing in the neighborhood of Santa Cruz, close to Huaca Pucllana. He went to school in the Champagnat School of Miraflores. He was deeply affected by the death of his father which also created a dire economic situation for his family. Later, he studied Arts and Law at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, between 1946 and 1952, where he met Pablo Macera, Alberto Escobar and Luis Felipe Angell \\"Sofocleto\\" among other youth with intellectual and artistic interests. He began his writing career with the short story The Grey Life which was published in the magazine Correo Bolivariano in 1948. In 1952 he won a journalism fellowship awarded by the Institute of Hispanic Culture, which allowed him to travel to Spain. First trip to Europe (1952‚Äì1958) He traveled by ship to Barcelona and from there went to Madrid, where he spent a year and studied at the Complutense University in that city. He also wrote some short stories and articles. By the end of his fellowship in 1953, he traveled to Paris to prepare a thesis on French literature at the Sorbonne University. By then he had written his first book Los gallinazos sin plumas (The featherless buzzards), a collection of short stories on urban issues, regarded as one of his most successful pieces of narrative writing. There, he decided to drop out and remained in Europe doing odd jobs, alternating his stay in France with brief periods in Germany and Belgium. It was in Munich between 1954 and 1956, where he wrote his first novel, Chronicle of San Gabriel. He returned to Paris and then traveled to Antwerp in 1957, where he worked in a factory of photography products. In 1958, he returned to Germany and spent some time in Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt. During his European stay he had to take on many trades to survive, including those of newspapers recycling, concierge, loader on the subway, seller of printing materials, among others. He returned to Lima in 1958. He was appointed as a professor at the National University of San Cristobal de Huamanga in Ayacucho, and instigated the creation of the Institute for Popular Culture, in 1959. In 1960 he published his novel Chronicle of San Gabriel, which earned him the National Prize for Novel that year. Second trip to Europe (1961) In 1961, he returned to Paris, where he worked as a journalist for ten years, Agence France Press. He was also cultural attache at the Peruvian Embassy in Paris, also play as a cultural consultant and ambassador of Peru to UNESCO. He married Alida Cordero and they had one child. In 1973, he operated a first lung cancer, caused by their addiction to cigarettes as a result of which he received a long treatment. Inspired by this experience, he wrote a book entitled \\"Only for smokers\\". In 1983, he received the National Book Award, and ten years later, the National Culture. Last years Generous with his friends and with young writers, Ribeyro never had enemies and was always very appreciated by his contemporaries. After being confirmed as ambassador to Unesco in the late 1980s, he had a very rough verbal exchange with fellow Peruvian and friend Mario Vargas Llosa, regarding the political debate in Peru around the proposed nationalization of banks by the first presidential term of Alan Garc√≠a government, which divided public opinion in the country. Ribeyro criticized Vargas Llosa for supporting the conservative sectors of the country, which according to him meant he was opposing the emergence of the popular classes. Vargas Llosa answered in his memoir A Fish in the Water (1993), by pointing out what he considered Ribeyro's lack of consistency, which made him appear subservient to every single government so as to maintain his diplomatic appointment in Unesco. However, apart from this embarrassing episode, Vargas Llosa has consistently praised the literary work of Ribeyro, whom he considers as one of the great storytellers in Spanish. The relationship between the two authors, who shared flat in Paris was otherwise complex and full of mysteries. His last years were spent traveling between Europe and Peru. In the last year of his life he had decided to remain definitely in his homeland in Peru. He died on December 4, 1994, days after getting the Juan Rulfo Prize for Literature.

The earliest mention of the Sentences is in the mid 3rd century by Origen.Origen, Contra Celsum, viii. 30; Commentary on Matthew, xv. 3 Origen quotes Sextus on self-castration, a widespread habit among ascetic early Christians, which Origen deplores, and mentions in passing that the work is one \\"that many considered to be tested by time.\\"Origen, Commentary on Matthew, xv. 3 While previously known from other versions, a partial Coptic translation appears in one of the books of the New Testament apocrypha recovered in the Nag Hammadi library. Contents The work is similar to the sayings gospels called the Gospel of Phillip and the Gospel of Thomas in that it is purely a collection of sayings, with no bridging framework. Unlike the Christian sayings gospels, the wisdom comes from a man named Sextus rather than Jesus. Sextus appears to have been a Pythagorean. Some of the 451 sentences are: *The soul is illuminated by the recollection of deity *Bear that which is necessary, as it is necessary *Be not anxious to please the multitude *Esteem nothing so precious, which a bad man may take from you *Use lying like poison *Guard yourself from lying. (Because when you lie) there is a deceiver and the deceived. *Nothing is so peculiar to wisdom as truth *Wish that you may be able to benefit your enemies *A wise intellect is the mirror of God *Cast away any part of the body that would cause you not to live abstinently. For it is better to live abstinently without this part than ruinously with it. (quoted by Origen) Authorship One possible author of the Sentences is Quintus Sextius, a Roman philosopher who combined Stoicism with Pythagoreanism, and who lived in the 1st century BC.Richard M. Gummere, (1917), Seneca, Epistles 1-65, page 412. Loeb Classical Library. By the time that Rufinus translated the Sentences into Latin (c. 400), the work had become attributed to Pope Sixtus II,Martha Lee Turner, (1996) \\"The Sentences of Sextus and Related Collections\\" in The Gospel according to Philip, page 104. BRILL. in early times one of the most venerated of all church figures. It is unlikely that he authored the text (partly as he wasn't Pythagorean). Such attribution to important figures, which frequently happened in the apocrypha, was usually an attempt to give them more authority.

It was established under the Access to Justice Act 1999 and in 2000 replaced the Legal Aid Board (founded 30 June 1949). Sponsored by the Ministry of Justice, the LSC helped to protect the fundamental rights of the individual and addressed problems that contribute to social exclusion.

Their gig in Arezzo was recorded, filmed and entirely broadcast by the TV music channel \\"VideoMusic\\". At the end of 1991 TB issued a 3 tracks EP on 12\\" entitled \\"Auto Da Fe'\\". This genuinely produced and marketed 12\\" sold 1,100 copies in Italy alone and only a few copies found their way to other European countries or overseas. The unexpected success of this first release helped the band to get their first deal with DUNE Records, the Contempo manufactured label of Pankow's Paolo Favati - certainly the most acclaimed producer for electronic music in Italy. The result \\"Wargasm\\" - a 6 track CD-Single entirely produced by Paolo F. and FM of Pankow quickly turned out to be another successful step. The single was distributed throughout the world and topped Electro charts in Germany (Technoclub), England (Hardclub, Eurobeat 2000) and especially Scandinavia. \\"Einstein On The Beach\\" a track from \\"Wargasm\\" - became a video clip that got heavy rotation on Videomusic and 3 appearances on MTV's 120 Minutes. Although several interesting offers came in from labels all around Europe, the band refused all approaches in order to concentrate on the work for their first full album, again produced by Paolo Favati and his production company Dune. While working on \\"Black Suburbia\\" (The title of the album), offers started to come in for live-appearances in Europe and the band joined Pankow on their very last tour 1992/93. Templebeat's concert in Prague has subsequently been filmed and broadcast on MTV's \\"120 Minutes\\" alongside an interview with the band. As an immediate result of their TV appearance (4/93) earlier contacts with foreign labels have been renewed and new offers for record deals started flooding in. In November 1993 finally, Dune and Templebeat decided to assign all national and international rights on the band to Audioglobe's Sub/Mission label. \\"Black Suburbia\\" the band's first album was licensed worldwide to Noise/Machinery records in Berlin and appeared in June 1994. Two singles \\"Heidi S.\\" and \\"Interzone\\" quickly became real dancefloor and headbanger classics in the German and American club scenes, and \\"Black Suburbia\\" has been successfully launched onto the American market in February 1995.

The Brazilian spelling of his first name is Ant√¥nio; Ant√≥nio Jos√© da Silva in Hebrew is ◊ê◊†◊ò◊ï◊†◊ô◊ï ◊ñ'◊ï◊ñ◊î ◊ì◊î ◊°◊ô◊ú◊ï◊ï◊î. Life His parents, Jo√£o Mendes da Silva and Louren√ßa Coutinho, were descended from Jews who had emigrated to the colony of Brazil to escape the Inquisition, but in 1702 that tribunal began to persecute the Marranos or anyone of Jewish descent in Rio, and in October 1712 Louren√ßa Coutinho became a victim. Her husband and children accompanied her to Portugal when Ant√≥nio was 7 years old,Ant√≥nio Jos√© Saraiva: The Marrano Factory: The Portuguese Inquisition and Its New Christians 1536-1765, p. 95 where she figured among the \\"reconciled\\" in the auto-da-f√© of July 9, 1713, after undergoing the torment only. Her husband, having then acquired a fixed domicile in Lisbon, settled down to advocacy with success, and he was able to send Ant√≥nio to the University of Coimbra, where he matriculated in the faculty of law. In 1726 Ant√≥nio was suddenly imprisoned along with his mother on August 8; on the 16th he suffered the first interrogation, and on September 23 he was put to the torment, with the result that three weeks later he could not sign his name. He confessed to having followed the practices of the Mosaic law, and this saved his life. He then went through the great auto-da-f√© held on October 23 in the presence of King John V and his court, abjured his errors, and was set at liberty. His mother was only released from prison in October 1729, after she had undergone torture and figured as a penitent in another auto-da-f√©. Meanwhile, Ant√≥nio had gone back to Coimbra, and finishing his course in 1728‚Äì1729 he returned to Lisbon and became associated with his father as an advocate. He found what he believed to be an ignorant and corrupt society ruled by an immoral yet fanatical monarch, who wasted millions on unprofitable buildings though the country was almost without roads and the people had become the most backward in Europe. As his plays show, the spectacle struck Ant√≥nio's observation, but he had to criticize with caution. He produced his first play or opera in 1733, and the next year he married his cousin, D. Leonor Maria de Carvalho, whose parents had been burnt by the Inquisition, while she herself had gone through an auto-da-f√© in Spain and been exiled on account of her religion. They had their first daughter in 1734, but the years of their happiness and of Silva's dramatic career were few, for on October 5, 1737, husband and wife were both imprisoned on the charge of \\"judaizing.\\" A slave of theirs had denounced them to the Holy Office. Though the details of the accusation against them seemed trivial and contradictory, and some of his friends testified about his Catholic piety and observation, Ant√≥nio was condemned to death. On October 18, like those who wanted to die in the Catholic faith, he was first strangled and after had his body burnt in an auto-da-f√©. His wife, who witnessed his death, did not long survive him.Antonio Jose da Silva, Jewish Virtual Library Legacy Slight as these sketches are, they show considerable dramatic talent and an Aristophanic wit. The characters are well drawn and the dialogue full of comic strength, the scenes knit together and the plot skillfully worked out. Moreover, Silva possessed a knowledge of stagecraft, and, if he had lived, he might have emancipated the drama in Portugal from its dependence on foreign writers; but the triple licence of the Palace, the Ordinary and the Inquisition, which a play required, crippled spontaneity and freedom. Even so, he showed some boldness in exposing types of the prevailing charlatanism and follies, though his liberty of speech is far less than that of Gil Vicente. His comedies give a truthful and interesting picture of 18th century society, especially his best comedy, the Alecrim e Mangerona, in which he treats of the fidalgo pobre, a type fixed by Vicente and Francisco Manuel de Melo. His works bear the title \\"operas\\" because, though written mainly in prose, they contain songs which Silva introduced in imitation of the true operas which then held the fancy of the public. He was also a lyric poet of real merit, combining correctness of form with a pretty inspiration and real feeling. His plays were published in the first two volumes of a collection entitled Theatro comico portuguez, which went through at least five editions in the 18th century, while the Alecrim e Mangerona appeared separately in some seven editions. This comedy and the Don Quixote have been reprinted in a critical edition with a life of Silva by Mendes dos Remedios (Coimbra, 1905). Ferdinand Denis, in his Chefs-d'≈ìuvre du th√©√¢tre portugais (pp. 365‚Äì496, Paris, 1823), prints liberal extracts, with a French translation, from the Vida de Dom Quixote, and F. Wolf likewise gives selections from Silva's various compositions. Silva is the subject also of several laudatory poems and dramas, one or two of which were composed by Brazilian compatriots. His story was dramatized in the 1996 film The Jew. Works His dramatic works, which were produced at the Bairro Alto theatre between 1733 and 1738, include the following comedies, all played by marionettes: *Vida do Grande Dom Quixote de la Mancha e do Gordo Sancho Pan√ßa (1733) *Esopaida (1734) *Os Encantos de Medea (1735) *Amphitri√£o (May 1736) *Labyrintho de Creta (November 1736) *Guerras do Alecrim e Mangerona (carnival of 1737) *As Variedades de Proteu (May 1737), set as a marionette opera by Ant√≥nio Teixeira.recording PortugalSom PS 5009 *Precipicio de Faetonte (1738) References  Further reading Te√≥filo Braga, Hist√≥ria do teatro portugu√™s, a baixa comedia e a opera (Oporto, 1871) *F Wolf, Dom Ant√≥nio Jos√© da Silva (Vienna, 1860) *Ernest David, Les Operas du juif Ant√≥nio Jos√© da Silva, 1705‚Äì1739 (Paris, 1880) *Oliveira Lima, Aspectos da literatura colonial Brasileira (Leipzig, 1896) *Jewish Encyclopedia, vol. xi. p. 341\\\\. *GA Kohnt, \\"Bibliography of Works relating to Ant√≥nio Jos√© da Silva and Bibliography of Don Ant√≥nio's Compositions\\" in the Publ.

They are used in the production of steels and alloys. The alloys impart distinctive qualities to steel and cast iron or serve important functions during production and are, therefore, closely associated with the iron and steel industry, the leading consumer of ferroalloys. The leading producers of ferroalloys in 2014 were China, South Africa, India, Russia and Kazakhstan, which accounted for 84% of the world production. World production of ferroalloys was estimated as 52.8 million tonnes in 2015.  Compounds  The main ferroalloys are: *FeAl ‚Äì ferroaluminum *FeB ‚Äì ferroboron ‚Äì 12‚Äì20% of boron, max. 3% of silicon, max. 2% aluminium, max. 1% of carbon *FeCe ‚Äì ferrocerium *FeCr ‚Äì ferrochromium *FeMg ‚Äì ferromagnesium *FeMn ‚Äì ferromanganese *FeMo ‚Äì ferromolybdenum ‚Äì min. 60% Mo, max. 1% Si, max. 0.5% Cu *FeNb ‚Äì ferroniobium *FeNi ‚Äì ferronickel (and nickel pig iron) *FeP ‚Äì ferrophosphorus *FeSi ‚Äì ferrosilicon ‚Äì 15‚Äì90% Si *FeSiMg ‚Äì ferrosilicon magnesium (with Mg 4 to 25%), also called nodulizer *FeTi ‚Äì ferrotitanium ‚Äì 10..30‚Äì65..75% Ti, max. 5‚Äì6.5% Al, max. 1‚Äì4% Si *FeU ‚Äì ferrouranium *FeV ‚Äì ferrovanadium *FeW ‚Äì ferrotungsten  Production, by processes  Evolution of the global ferroalloys production, by processes. Ferroalloys are produced generally by two methods : in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace. Blast furnace production continuously decreased during the 20th century, whereas the electric arc production is still increasing. Today, ferromanganese can be still efficiently produced in a blast furnace, but, even in this case, electric arc furnace are spreading. More commonly, ferroalloys are produced by carbothermic reactions, involving reduction of oxides with carbon (as coke) in the presence of iron. Some ferroalloys are produced by the addition of elements into molten iron. It is also possible to produce somme ferroalloys by processes. For example, the is used in Japan to produce ferronickel. Production and consumption, by ferroalloys Ferrochromium =Ferrochromium= The leading world chromite ore-producing countries in 2014 were South Africa (12 Mt), Kazakhstan (3.7 Mt), India (3.5 Mt), and Turkey (2.6 Mt). Most of the chromite ore production was smelted in electric-arc furnaces to produce ferrochromium for the metallurgical industry. The leading world ferrochromium-producing countries in 2014 were China (4.5 Mt), South Africa (3.6 Mt), Kazakhstan (1.2 Mt) and India (0.9 Mt). Most of the 11.7 Mt of ferrochromium produced worldwide was consumed in the manufacture of stainless steel which totalled 41.7 Mt in 2014. =Ferromanganese= Two manganese ferroalloys, ferromanganese and silicomanganese, are key ingredients for steelmaking. China is the leading world producer of manganese ferroalloys (2.7 Mt), with output about much greater than that of the next three major producers‚ÄîBrazil (0.34 Mt), South Africa (0.61 Mt) and Ukraine (0.38 Mt)‚Äîcombined. =Ferromolybdenum= Major producers of ferromolybdenum are Chile (16,918 t), China (40,000 t) and the United States which accounted for about 78% of world production of molybdenite ore in 2008, whereas Canada, Mexico and Peru accounted for the remainder. Molybdenite concentrates are roasted to form molybdic oxide, which can be converted into ferromolybdenum, molybdenum chemicals, or molybdenum metal. Although the United States was the second leading molybdenum-producing country in the world in 2008, it imported more than 70% of its ferromolybdenum requirements in 2008, mostly for the steel industry (83% of ferromolybdenum consumed). =Ferronickel= In 2008, the major ferronickel-producing countries were Japan (301,000 t), New Caledonia (144,000 t) and Colombia (105,000 t). Together, these three countries accounted for about 51% of world production if China is excluded. Ukraine, Indonesia, Greece, and Macedonia, in descending order of gross weight output, all produced between 68,000 t and 90,000 t of ferronickel, accounting for an additional 31%, excluding China. China was excluded from statistics because its industry produced large tonnages of nickel pig iron in addition to a spectrum of conventional ferronickel grades, for an estimated combined output of 590,000 t gross weight. The nickel content of individual Chinese products varied from about 1.6% to as much as 80%, depending upon customer end use. In the United States, the steel industry accounted for virtually all the ferronickel consumed in 2008, with more than 98% used in stainless and heat- resistant steels; no ferronickel was produced in the US in 2008. The nickel pig iron is a low grade ferronickel made in China, which is very popular since the 2010s. =Ferrosilicon= Ferrosilicon Silicon ferroalloy consumption is driven by cast iron and steel production, where silicon alloys are used as deoxidizers. Some silicon metal was also used as an alloying agent with iron. On the basis of silicon content, net production of ferrosilicon and miscellaneous silicon alloys in the US was 148,000 t in 2008. China is the major supplier, which in 2008 produced more ferrosilicon (4.9 Mt) than the rest of the world combined. Other major manufacturers are Norway (0.21 Mt), Russia (0.85 Mt) and US (0.23 Mt). =Ferrotitanium= Titanium is used in steelmaking for deoxidation, grain-size control, and carbon and nitrogen control and stabilization. During steelmaking, titanium is usually introduced as ferrotitanium because of its relatively low melting temperature and high density. Steels with relatively high titanium content include interstitial- free, stainless and high-strength low-alloy steels. Ferrotitanium is usually produced by induction melting of titanium scrap with iron or steel; however, it also is produced directly from titanium mineral concentrates. The standard grades of ferrotitanium are 30% and 70% titanium. Ferrosilicon-titanium also is produced to allow the simultaneous addition of silicon and titanium. The leading ferrotitanium producing countries include Brazil, China, India, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, United Kingdom and the United States. =Ferrotungsten= Tungsten is an important alloying element in high-speed and other tool steels, and is used to a lesser extent in some stainless and structural steels. Tungsten is often added to steel melts as ferrotungsten, which can contain up to 80% tungsten. World ferrotungsten production is dominated by China, which in 2008 exported 4,835 t (gross weight) of the alloy. Ferrotungsten is relatively expensive, with the prices around $31‚Äì44 per kilogram of contained tungsten. =Ferrovanadium= Ferrovanadium chunks In 2008, China, Russia (12,000 t) and South Africa (17,000 t) accounted for 98% of world vanadium mine production. In these three countries, vanadium was primarily recovered from titanium-bearing magnetite ore processed to produce pig iron. The process entails aluminothermic reduction of vanadium(V) oxide, aluminium (as oxide getter), and scrap iron. This produces a slag containing 20% to 24% vanadium pentoxide, which can be further processed to ferrovanadium containing 40% to 50% vanadium. Of the 5,090 t of vanadium consumed in the United States in 2008, 84% came from ferrovanadium and nearly all of it (99%) went into steel manufacturing.

Together with 1 Enoch's Book of Watchers, as Enochian scholar James C. VanderKam maintains, \\"it stands as an attempt to explain how it was that wickedness had become so widespread and muscular before the flood; in so doing, it also supplies the reason why God was more than justified in sending that flood.\\"\\"Genesis notes that corruption and violence were widespread and that human thoughts were continually evil, but it does not explain how that had come about\\"; VanderKam (2008/1995), pp. 41, 128. The Giants discovery at Qumran dates the text's creation to before the 2nd century BC. The Book of Giants is an antediluvian (pre-Flood) narrative that was received primarily in Manichaean literature and known at Turfan. However, the earliest known traditions for the book originate in Aramaic copies of a Book of Giants among the Dead Sea Scrolls. References to the Giants mythology are found in: Genesis 6:1-4, the books of Enoch (Ethiopic, Slavonic, Hebrew, Greek), Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, 2 and 3 Baruch (Slavonic), the Damascus Document, and visions in Daniel 7:9-14. This book tells of the background and fate of these ante-deluvial giants and their fathers, the Watchers (called grigori in the Slavonic 2 Enoch), the 'sons of God' or 'holy ones' (Daniel 4:13, 17) who rebelled against heaven when ‚Äî in forbidden violation of the strict \\"boundaries of creation\\" ‚Äî they commingled, in their lust, with the 'daughters of men.'At Jubilees 20:5, the patriarch Abraham uses the punishment of the giants (referred to as rebel beney Seth, 'the sons of Seth' ‚Äî a righteous son of Adam ‚Äî or apostate sons of the beney ha 'elohim, the sons of God [Watchers]: half-breed Sethite 'giants' engendered through exogamy) as \\"an example of what happens to those who pollute themselves through sexual union with 'the daughters of Canaan' [called also the benot ha 'adam, \\"the daughters of Cain\\" ‚Äî the murderous son of Adam].\\" Elsewhere in the Enochic literature, the archangel Gabriel is commanded of God to \\"Go ... to the ill-begotten ones, the crooked ones, and the sons of adultery; and destroy the sons of the Watchers [the giants] from among men. Set them to fighting each other in war and in wanton destruction\\" (Codex Gizeh 10:9). Such \\"intramural rivalry\\" is, according to Stuckenbruck, \\"a manifestation of divine punishment\\" and a \\"violence\\" that cascaded to be \\"absorbed\\" into the behavior of the rest of Earth's inhabitants (see Jub 5:2, 7, 9 and 7:22; 1 En 7:5, 10:12). A striking parallel to this \\"intramural rivalry\\" is witnessed at Enochic Moses 7:4-7 (see herein \\"A 'Book of Moses' connection\\"), wherein God, speaking \\"face to face\\" with Enoch (who had turned aside from Mahijah's companionship to pray upon a mount before experiencing this theophany), directs him to behold in coming \\"generations\\" the utter obliteration of one \\"great people\\" by another. The giants' \\"internecine strife\\" and \\"denied longevity,\\" however, meant for them, as VanderKam observes, \\"mutual annihilation.\\" See Stuckenbruck (1997), pp. 148, 151 note 185, 152 note 189; Reeves, pp. 68, 182, 186; and VanderKam (2008/1995), pp. 39-40. Their even more corrupt offspring, the giants, were variously called thereafter nephilim, gibborim, or rephaim, being the earthly half-breed races that fought against God and his righteous followers whose numbers diminished as the world was overwhelmed with corruption and evil; the Manichaean fragments give these wicked ones the general name demons (Greek Enoch calls them bastards).Reeves, John C. (1992). Jewish Lore in Manichaean Cosmogony: Studies in the Book of Giants Traditions. Cincinnati, Ohio: Hebrew Union College Press. pp. 2-3, 9, 22, 30-32, 65, 67, 69-72, 76, 81-102, 109-110, 114, 118-121, 124-127, 130, 133-134, 138-139, 147, 154, 156-158 notes 334, 347 and 353, 207-209. Though the terms for the Watchers and their offspring are often confused in their various translations and iterations, collectively these rebellious races are referred to as the \\"fallen angels\\" in the apocryphal sources, as also in the biblical narratives that reference them.Stuckenbruck, Loren T. (1997). The Book of Giants From Qumran: Texts, Translation, and Commentary. T√ºbingen, Germany: Mohr Siebeck. pp. 24-28, 31, 72-74, 79, 81, 83, 90, 105, 114, 125-127, 143, 164-167, 182. Origins in ancient Jewish tradition Since before the latter half of the twentieth century, the 'Book of Giants' had long been known as a 'Middle Iranian' work (which some scholars now believe was written originally in 'Eastern Aramaic') that circulated among the Manichaeans as a composition attributed to Mani (c. AD 216 ‚Äì 274) ‚Äî a Parthian citizen of southern Mesopotamia who appears to have been a follower of Elkesai, a Jewish-Christian prophet and visionary who lived in the early years of the second century. Some scholars, concordant with supporting evidence for the ancient sect's geographical distribution, have posited both genetic and ritual-custom similarities between the Elcesaites and the earlier Second Temple Jewish sect of the Essenes (Essaioi 'Saints'). During the twentieth century a number of finds shed considerable light on the literary evidence for the Book of Giants. The 1943 publication by W. B. Henning of the Manichaean fragments from the Book of Giants discovered at Turfan in Western China (in what is now Xinjiang Province) have substantiated the many references to its circulation among, and use by, the Manichaeans. Further identification of the Manichaean Book of Giants was revealed in 1971 when J√≥sef T. Milik discovered several additional Aramaic fragments of Enochic works among the Dead Sea Scrolls; he astonished the scholarly world upon announcing that the fragments bore close resemblance to Mani's Book of Giants, then added to the astonishment his belief, too, that Giants was originally an integral part of 1 Enoch itself. These fragmentary scrolls in Aramaic, which represented an Enochic tradition that was likely introduced to Mani in his sojourn with the Ecesaites, appeared to have been the primary source utilized by Mani in the compilation of his book, in which he made the legend of the Watchers and the giants \\"a cornerstone of his theological speculations.\\" And for many scholars, the Qumran fragments confirmed the Book of Giants to originally have been an independent composition from the Second Temple period. Among the fragments discovered at Qumran, ten manuscripts of the Book of Giants are identified by Stuckenbruck. These fragments (1Q23 , 1Q24 , 2Q26 , 4Q203 , 4Q530 , 4Q531 , 4Q532 , 4Q556 , 4Q206 , and 6Q8 ) were found in caves 1, 2, 4, and 6 at the site. These discoveries led to further classification of the Enochic works. In the third group of classification, ten Aramaic manuscripts contain parts of the Book of Giants which were only known through the Manichaean sources until the recognition of them at Qumran.Nickelsburg, George W. E.; VanderKam, James C., eds. (2001). 1 Enoch 1: A Commentary on the Book of 1 Enoch. Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress. pp. 8-11, 81-108, 137, 174, 180, 188, 215, 221-222, 225, 234, 237-247, 250-251, 276, 297, 300, 536-537, 560. There has been much speculation regarding the original language of the Book of Giants. It was generally believed to have had a Semitic origin. Indeed, the discovery of this text at Qumran led scholars, such as C. P. van Andel and Rudolf Otto, to believe that while these ancient Aramaic compositions of the book were the earliest known, the work probably had even earlier Hebrew antecedents.Van Andel, C. P. (1955). The Structure of the Enoch-Tradition and the New Testament: An Investigation into the Milieu of Apocalyptic and Sectarian Traditions within Judaism in their Relation to the Milieu of the Primitive Apostolic Gospel. Domplein, Urecht: Kemink and Son. pp. 9, 11, 43, 47, 51, 69-70. It was of course the great R. H. Charles, translator and publisher in 1906 of The Book of Enoch, who asserted that Enoch was \\"built upon the debris of\\" an older Noah saga than that in Genesis which only cryptically refers to the Enoch myth.Charles, R. H. (1913). [1906]. The Book of Enoch. London: Oxford University Press. pp. ix (note 1), 305. Centenary Edition by Weiser Books. But Milik himself offered his own hypothesis that Enoch's 'creation story' and law of God account naturally predate the Mosaic Sinai accounts in Genesis: He saw Genesis 6:1-4 ‚Äî long a puzzling passage to biblical scholars ‚Äî as a quotation from what he believed ultimately to have been the earlier Enoch source.Milik maintains, further, that the Qumran Damascus Document (at CD 2:17-19) \\"quotes from the Book of Giants (in Hebrew!).\\" Milik (1976), pp. 57-58; Reeves (1992), pp. 52-53, 129 note 17. More recent scholarship, such as that of Klaus Beyer, indicates that the Book of Giants (parts of which have been found in Hebrew at Qumran) was \\"originally composed in Hebrew during the 3rd century BCE, while the names of the giants Gilgamesh and Hobabish betray a Babylonian provenance\\" ‚Äî which Babylonian-origins claim based on the name appearances, however, is refuted by Mart√≠nez (Stuckenbruck [1997], pp. 5 note 22, 30, 208 note 273, 220 note 27; Mart√≠nez [2018/1992], p. 114). But whatever the reality, one thing remains certain: the Qumran books and their fragments are now the oldest known Enochic manuscripts in existence. Contents =Dead Sea Scrolls version= The text unearthed at Qumran in 1948 was composed of fragments in Aramaic. Because of the book's fragmentation, it was difficult for the documents' linguistic researchers and specialists to know, in its subsequently varied permutations, the exact order of the content. The 'Giants' work is closely related to the 1 Enoch analogue, which also tells a story of the giants, but one which is far more elaborate. The Qumran Book of Giants also bears resemblance to the Manichaean Book of Giants that came after it. Scholars, beyond their many questions of the Enochic tradition's oral or written transmission, still don't know why the Qumran community considered the Enochic texts so important that they possessed and retained so many copies in comparison to other textual traditions found there. The Book of GiantsSchiffman, L. H., & VanderKam, J. C., eds. (2008). Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls. 2 Vols. New York: Oxford University Press. is an expansive narrative of the biblical story of the birth of 'giants' in Genesis 6.1-4. In this story, the giants came into being when the Watcher 'sons of God' (who, per the story's corroborative JubileesJubilees intimately connects with Enoch's story. Jub 4:17-23 presents, for example, the perspective of the heavenly archangels who direct and instruct Enoch in Wisdom: \\"We told him\\"; \\"we taught him\\"; \\"we led him\\". See VanderKam (2008/1995), pp. 112-114, 128-129. account [Jub 4:15; 5:6], God originally dispatched to earth for the purpose of instructing and nurturing humanity \\"in proper ritual and ethical conduct,\\" \\"to do what is just and upright upon the earth\\") were seduced by and had sexual intercourse with mortal women,The Watchers' \\"freedom\\" or \\"agency\\" in the context of their choice to trespass creation's boundaries as set by God is touched upon in 2 Baruch (56:11-14), whereat they are declared to have \\"possessed freedom in that time in which they were created,\\" but that \\"some of them came down and mingled themselves with women,\\" while \\"the rest of the multitude of angels, who have no number, restrained themselves.\\" 2 Baruch accords with the Book of Moses (7:32) concerning this gift of choice to God's intelligent creations: \\"The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy [fallen] brethren [for whom Enoch attempts to intercede, and for whom he weeps, as do the Heavens and God Himself]; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden [the premortal paradise], gave I unto man his agency\\" also. See Moses 7:28-29, 41. who then birthed a hybrid race of giants. These Watchers (grigori) and giants (nephilim) engaged in destructive and grossly immoral actions which devastated humanity, including the revealing of heaven's holy \\"secrets\\" or \\"mysteries to their wives and children\\" and to mankind generally. When Enoch heard of this, he was distressed and petitioned God,1 Enoch 9 describes also the petition of four heavenly archangels, in which they bring before God's high court the suit (rib 'lawsuit') of humankind on Earth, whose souls cry out (their \\"lamentations\\" reaching \\"the gates of heaven\\") from the murderous acts of the \\"lawless\\" ones ‚Äî Azazel (Satan), Shemihazah (Watcher chieftain), the Watchers and their giant-sons. who in his longsuffering and by divine revelation and counsel called Enoch to preach repentance unto them, that the earthly races might avoid God's wrath and destruction. In his mercy, God chose also to give the fallen Watchers an additional chance to repent by transmitting dreams to several of their giant-sons, including two brothers named Ohyah and Hahyah who relayed the dreams to an assembly of their grigori and nephilim companions. This assembly of Watcher-giant associates were perplexed by the dreams,Nickelsburg, George W. E.; VanderKam, James C., eds. (2012). 1 Enoch 2: A Commentary on the Book of 2 Enoch. Minneapolis, Minnesota: Fortress Press. pp. 49-50, 95, 111, 119, 130, 148, 153, 166, 180, 187, 194, 198, 224, 233, 243, 247, 254-255, 273-274, 297, 311, 315, 320. so they sent a giant named Mahway to Enoch‚Äôs abode and to the places of his preaching (for Mahway had been instructed that he must first \\"hear\\" the prophet speak before petitioning him for the \\"oracle\\"). Enoch, in his attempt to intercede on their behalf, provided not only the oracle that the Watchers and giants had requested, but also twin \\"tablets\\" that revealed the full meaning of their dreams and God‚Äôs future judgment against them. When the Watchers and giants had at last heard heaven's response, many chose, in their transcendent pride and arrogance,The 'Damascus Document,' or 'Covenant' (CD), another Qumran text, warns those it speaks to against prideful \\"will\\" and lustful \\"thoughts\\" and \\"eyes\\": \\"For through them, great men have gone astray and mighty heroes have stumbled from former times till now. Because they walked in stubbornness of their heart the Heavenly Watchers fell; they were caught because they did not keep the commandments of God. And their sons [the giants] also fell ... All flesh on dry land perished [in fiery archangelic retribution and flood]; they were as though they had never been because they did their own will and did not keep the commandments of their Maker so that His wrath was kindled against them\\" (CD 2:16-20). rather than to turn from their evil ways, to act in defiance against God.The avowed arch-enemies of the grigori and nephilim ‚Äî Ohyah's \\"opponents\\" who \\"derive their power from heaven\\" yet were \\"still not stronger\\" than himself (he claimed) ‚Äî that is, in addition to the archangels (whom he admitted were stronger), were Enoch's righteous-preacher kin (Moses 6:23) ‚Äî the patriarch's ancient forebears who were then still living and who dwelt with their righteous followers in mountain heights \\"set apart\\" (Reeves, p. 77; VanderKam [2008/1995], p. 11; Stuckenbruck [1997], p. 126). The fallen angels described the dwelling-places of their angelic \\"accusers\\" as being in \\"the heavens, for they live in holy abodes,\\" which would have been also, by the lights of the ancients, an apt description for abodes set amidst the mountains, where Enoch's people dwelt. These may have been located beyond the \\"great desert\\" of \\"Solitude\\" (perhaps within the \\"K√∂gm√∂n\\" mountains of Milik's translation, identified now as Siberia's Sayan Mountain range). But as Enoch is referred to as the \\"apostle from the south,\\" a rather different region ‚Äî to the safety of which Enoch beckons Mahway in his dream ‚Äî seems indicated). It may also be the case, because of the close association of God's righteous with the heavenly archangels, that the fallen-angel races, in describing their enemy's abode, may have similarly described the dwellings of Enoch's \\"holy people.\\" See Milik (1976), pp. 306-308, and Reeves (1992), p. 153 note 286; but also Richard J. Clifford (2010). [1972]. The Cosmic Mountain in Canaan and the Old Testament. Eugene, Oregon: Wipf & Stock. Originally published by Harvard University Press: Cambridge. . The great desert referenced by Mahway was conceivably the Syrian desert, according to Reeves, pp. 104, 119. The Qumran fragments are incomplete at this point. =Manichaean version= The Manichaean version is similar to the one found in Qumran, only adapted to Mani's story of the cosmos. The fallen angels are here archontic demons escaped from their prisons in the sky, where they were placed when the world was constructed. They would have caused a brief revolt, and in the process, two hundred of them escaped to the Earth. While most given names are simply translated into Iranian language, Ohyah and Hahyah are renamed Sam and Nariman.Xaviant Haze, Ancient Giants: History, Myth, and Scientific Evidence from around the World, 2018, Simon and Schuster, This version also contains a complete ending, telling how the forces of the Light, led by four angels identified with Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Istrael, subdue the demons and their offspring in battle. =Other texts= Much of the content in the Book of Giants is similar, and most closely relates, to 1 Enoch 7:3-6, a passage which sheds light on the characterizing features of the giants. It reveals that the giants were born of the Watcher 'sons of God' and the 'daughters of men.' The giants, as their 'prostituted' half-breed offspring, began to devour the works of what they perceived to be a lesser race and went on to kill and to viciously exploit them in slavery and sexual debauchery. They also sinned against nature, in the most defiling and violent of ways against the beasts and birds of the sky, creeping things and the fish of the sea, but also against one another. They murdered on a massive scale, and also aborted their own children. The Qumran documents also mention that the giants devoured the flesh of those they exploited and of one another, and drank the blood [7]. This act of drinking blood would have horrified the people [8]. This offence is also mentioned in Leviticus 17:10-16, wherein strict rules are laid forth regarding the blood of animals and all living creatures; verses 10 and 11 warn, ‚ÄúI will set my face against any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who eats blood and I will cut them off from the people. For the life of the creature is in the blood.‚Äù Fallen Angels among Men: a genesis of evil The Qumran texts that make up its so-called Book of Giants seem to offer, for various faiths, a more complete picture of the beginnings of evil than perhaps its rather truncated counterpart ‚Äî the biblical Eden story ‚Äî is able to give.Stuckenbruck, Loren T.

The Qumran fragments that began to be discovered in 1948 relate how a small cadre of giants ‚Äì offspring of the 'fallen angels' called Watchers ‚Äì including Ohyah and Hahyah (alternately, 'Ohya' and 'Hahya'), who were both sons of Shemihazah, chieftain of the Watchers, and also Mahway, giant-son of the Watcher Baraq'el,Baraq'el appears as 'Vir≈çgdƒÅd' in the Manichaean fragments of the Book of Giants and as 'Irad' in the Enochic account in the Book of Moses (5:43) ‚Äî for which, see herein \\"A 'Book of Moses' connection.\\" Baraq'el is also (in Jubilees 4:15) the father of Dinah, the wife of Enoch's grandfather Mahalaleel, making Mahway/Mahujael, if the accounts are consistent, the prophet Enoch's first cousin once-removed. Reeves states that \\"Baraq'el was one of the twenty principal Watchers [each a chieftain over ten other angels] who descended to earth, and was responsible for instructing humankind in the forbidden science of astrology\\" (1 Enoch 6:7, 8:3). See Reeves (1992), pp. 76, 108, 138 note 98; Bradshaw (2014), p. 96. experience dreams that foresee the biblical Flood [9]. These disturbing omens are told to the assembly of fallen angels that had originally organized their secret society upon Mount Hermon as a body of 200 members, bound together by a dark combination of clandestine oaths and operational pacts by which they might ruthlessly achieve their personal and collective aims. A brief mention of the giant Ohya (Ohyah), is found in the Babylonian Talmud (Nidah, Ch 9), which gives the following: \\"◊°◊ô◊ó◊ï◊ü ◊ï◊¢◊ï◊í ◊ê◊ó◊ô ◊î◊ï◊ï ◊ì◊ê◊û◊® ◊û◊® ◊°◊ô◊ó◊ï◊ü ◊ï◊¢◊ï◊í ◊ë◊†◊ô ◊ê◊ó◊ô◊î ◊ë◊® ◊©◊û◊ó◊ñ◊ê◊ô ◊î◊ï◊ï\\" (\\"Sihon and Og [from the Book of Numbers] were brothers, as they were the sons of Ohia the son of Samhazai [alternately, 'Shemihazah' or 'Semiazus,' chieftain of the fallen angels in the Book of Enoch].\\") Thus are provided, it would seem, the names of the sons of Ohyah, grandsons of Shemihazah. \\"Og king of Bashan,\\" ostensibly a giant, presumably escaped the flood (Num 13; Deut 2:2, 3:11, 13; Josh 12:4).

The giant Mahway, an associate of Ohyah, is summoned to the assembly of the fallen angels and put under secret oath 'under pain of death' to approach Enoch, the \\"distinguished scribe\\"The scribal titles of Enoch-Metatron, the \\"witness of God\\" and \\"judge of all men\\" ‚Äî beyond that of \\"celestial\\" or \\"heavenly scribe\\" and \\"keeper of the Book of Life\\" ‚Äî include, simply, \\"the scribe,\\" but also \\"distinguished scribe,\\" \\"scribe of distinction,\\" \\"Great Scribe,\\" \\"scribe of Justice,\\" \\"scribe of Righteousness (and Truth),\\" \\"scribe of trustworthy deeds\\" and \\"scribe of all the wonder of Wisdom\\" (Milik [1976], pp. 97, 104, 118, 128, 130-131, 237, 261-263, 305; at recension B, Testament of Abraham 11:3, Enoch stands, along with his \\"evidence\\" at the final Judgement bar of God, as \\"the teacher of heaven and earth and the scribe of righteousness\\"). Beyond his scribal role, Enoch, the \\"High Priest\\" (or angel-priest and \\"upholder of Wisdom\\" in the \\"true cult of God\\"), was also ‚Äî as \\"the seventh [patriarch] from Adam\\" ‚Äî the great \\"sage-king\\" whom (at 3 En 48:9) the \\"King of kings\\" and \\"Holy One\\" (3 En 25:4) placed over the \\"seventy [guardian-angel] shepherds\\" (1 En 89-90), or unwise rulers of nations and kingdoms throughout time (\\"sacred history divided into seventy ages\\"), who are called at the final Judgement to account for their stewardships before the holy throne of the Son of Man (Milik, pp. 24, 29, 31, 43-45, 47, 52, 114-115, 248, 252, 254, 257, 304, 313, 431; VanderKam (2008/1995), pp. 81-89; Barker (2005/1988), pp. 29-30, 72-73; see Jer 6:3, 23:1-4; 25; Zech 10:2-3, 11:3-6, 15-17, 13:7; John 5:27). and \\"apostle from the south\\" (Milik, p. 307; see Jubilees 4:25-6), in order to obtain prophetic interpretation of their sons' ominous visions of what appears threateningly to them as an imminent catastrophe: \\"An oracle [I have come to ask you] here,\\" declares Mahway, after listening to Enoch's message to the people. \\"From you, a second time, [I] ask for the oracle: [We shall listen to] your words, all the nephilim of the earth also. If God is going to take away ... from the days of their [existence]The fallen angels had wished to live to be 500 years old, Noah's age when his sons were born: 1 En 10:9-10; Gen 5:32; VanderKam (2008/1995), pp. 39-40. ... that they may be punished ... [we, of these portents,] should like to know from you their explanation.\\" The elements of Hahyah's troubling dream include 200 garden-trees and gardeners, an Emperor, mighty winds, water, and fire. Enoch obliges the messenger of the Shemihazah-led assembly with his interpretation of the dreams: the 200 (female) trees watered by corrupt angelic 'gardeners' are, against their original nature, demon-defiled and unfruitful (producing bad fruit) ‚Äî their waterers are the Watchers (once-good 'protector' or guardian angels gone bad) and the \\"great\\" shoots issuing from them, their bad-seed giant progeny ‚Äî upon whom the \\"Emperor of heaven\\" will descend as a \\"burning Sun\\" (as upon a mighty \\"whirlwind\\" of fury) in great judgment: \\"O ye lamentable ones, do not die now prematurely, but turn quickly back!\\" is the declaration Mahway claims to have heard in his own dream (in which he is borne aloft on avian wings above the wilderness, the dearth and fray). The other visionary elements, as interpreted by Enoch, represent future exterminations by fire and water (sparing only \\"three shoots\\" ‚Äî which Milik explains is an ancient Hebrew expression for Noah's sons).Noah and his sons together represented, in both the Qumranic and Manichaean traditions, a \\"tree of life\\" for the renewed creation. But moreover, the \\"elect of God\\" would thereafter ever be known to both Jew and Christian as a \\"plant of righteousness\\" ‚Äî a reference which is used also throughout Enoch's prophecies in the Apocalypse of Weeks to refer to the \\"holy seed\\" of Abraham who, as \\"the righteous community of Israel at the End of Days,\\" would honour a renewed 'eternal' or new 'creation covenant' and so merit the eternal reward of deification. As in the Book of Dreams when Enoch begs God to spare \\"a plant of the eternal seed\\" (1 En 84:6), so in the Book of Moses, the Lord of Spirits ‚Äî in response to Enoch's mourning \\"over his brethren\\" (7:44), \\"the children of Noah\\" (7:49) and the Earth (7:58: \\"When shall the earth rest?\\") ‚Äî promises by covenantal oath to \\"preserve\\" the \\"elect\\" of His chosen \\"people\\" not only in Noah and his seed (7:51-52), but also at the last day (7:61-62). In what Boccaccini calls Qumran's Temple Scroll- and Jubilees-affiliated Epistle of Enoch of \\"Enochic Judaism,\\" the Apocalypse of Weeks is, in its historical determinism, \\"entirely focused on the concept of election. As in [Enoch's Book of Dreams], history is subjected to inexorable degeneration [apostasy] until the end, but, as [in] Jubilees [as also in Enoch's Similitudes] ... in this world there is a distinctive group of chosen people, the plant of righteousness, Israel. ... [A]t the beginning of the final times [the last days, when an \\"interim temple\\" is rebuilt \\"until the day of the new creation\\" (Jub 1:15-18; 1 En 53:6-7) and the \\"divinely created\\" eschatological Temple of \\"the world to come\\" (11QT 29:2-10)] ...

This group [latter-day Israel ‚Äî the \\"generation of righteous ones\\" of 1 En 107:1 ‚Äî who are worthy to enter that \\"interim\\" sanctuary] will receive special 'wisdom' and will keep themselves separate from the rest of the people while acting on their behalf and thus preparing the way for the redemption of Israel and of the entire creation. [They would be led by a \\"unique prophet\\" and high priest, messianic in nature, who would teach and interpret, but also suffer and die (Testaments Benj, Sim, Dan, Gad; CD 12; 1QS; 1QSa; 4Q175): the \\"herald\\" of Daniel 9 and 11QMelchizedek, whom Jewish legend calls 'Messiah ben Joseph' (the great white-bull gatherer of God's elect {Deut 33:17} who becomes the slaughter-lamb of 1 En 90:37-38), resurrected martyr-forerunner to the great 'Messiah ben David' ‚Äî who embodies the joy-inducing revelation, as Barker calls it, of 'the name of the great Son of Man' as it is finally 'restored to the true servants as part of the Wisdom of the last times' ‚Äî together with 'the hope of a transforming Wisdom to be revealed to the righteous in the last days before their own exaltation'; The Older Testament, pp. 279-280] ... Finally, we have the return to the primordial stage with the final judgment and the new creation, which opens the path to the eternal glory of the world to come ... [After the apocalyptic 'ten weeks,' the \\"elect\\" who are chosen \\"from among the chosen\\"] 'will gain riches in righteousness and there will be built the house [Temple] of sovereignty of the Great One [the Lord of Spirits], in his magnificence, for all eternal generations ... and there shall be no more sin forever' (1 En 91:12-13, 17).\\" See Reeves (1992), pp. 95-102, 150-151 notes 246, 250, 253, 255, 256; VanderKam (2008/1995), pp. 40, 64, 68-69, 84-85; Hanson (1977), pp. 201, 220; Boccaccini (1998), Chapter 4: \\"The Formative Age: The Proto-Epistle of Enoch, Including the Apocalypse of Weeks\\"; John J.

Mahway had also claimed to have heard Enoch \\"speaking my name very lovingly\\" in his desperate plea and call that the giant follow Enoch to safety. Later, after the fallen angels of Watchers and giants had asked Enoch to make petition and to intercede for them before God,1 Enoch 84 records Enoch's intercessory prayer \\"after he had experienced an especially frightening vision of cosmic destruction (1 Enoch 83: the impending Flood). His grandfather Mahalaleel advises Enoch to petition God for mercy [that a faithful remnant be spared], and Enoch accordingly addresses God with the prayer of 84:2-6. God responds to Enoch's plea by vouchsafing him yet another vision\\" ‚Äî which is recorded in the Book of Dreams (1 Enoch 85-90). Indeed, it was while in the very act of \\"[lifting] up [his] hands in righteousness\\" to praise \\"the Holy and Great One\\" and speak \\"with the breath of [his] mouth\\" to offer \\"praise to the Great Lord, the Eternal King\\" (12:3; 84:1) that \\"the Watchers cried out\\" to Enoch, asking him to intercede for them before God. See Reeves (1992), pp. 82, 141 note 147. These visions and exchanges with the Watchers and giants come to a relatively young Enoch, not yet 65, staying with his grandfather, before his marriage to Edni (Jub 4:20). It is only long after that he relates them all to his son Methuselah: VanderKam (2008/1995) pp. 71-73, 115. Enoch (who takes his ascent in the northern land of Dan, at the foot of Mount Hermon) returned from that heavenly attempt (as he would also from his later universal visions and cosmic journeys made in the last year of his earthly sojourn, guided by the archangel Uriel) with two tablets ‚Äî an 'Epistle' written in 'the distinguished scribe's own hand' from the Lord of Spirits and 'the Holy One,' giving God's answer \\"to Shemihazah and all his companions\\": > Let it be known to you that ... your works and those of your wives and your > children by your prostitution on the earth [the giants themselves being the > 'sons of prostitution'] ... It now befalls you [that] the earth complains > and accuses you [for your works], and the works of your children also, and > her voice rises to the very portals of heaven, complaining and accusing you > of the corruption by which you have corrupted her. [But she will mourn] > until the coming of Raphael [Metatron-Enoch]. For lo! a destruction upon men > and on animals: the birds which fly upon the face of heaven, and the animals > which live on the earth, and those which live in the deserts, and those > which live in the seas. And [thus does] the interpretation of your [dreams > come upon] you for the worst. Whereupon, after the assembly of fallen angels are read the words of the Epistle (see 1 Enoch 13:3-5), the giants and Watchers, gathered together at the place Abel-mayy√¢ ('the spring of Weeping' between Lebanon and Senir),'Abel-mayy√¢' (Abel-ma√Æn, also Abelsj√¢√Æl) is modern Tel Abil, located northwest of 'the waters of Dan' (the source of Palestine's Jordan River; conceptually seen also as the Sea of Galilee) at the mouth of the valley between the Lebanon range to the west and Mount Hermon (ancient Senir, Seneser, Sion, Sirion, Siryanu, Sariyana, among the mountain's many names in antiquity; 'Hermon' is related to the word for 'swearing an oath'). Symbol- laden 'waters' were traditionally a place of revelation and could \\"stand in polar relationship to the gates of heaven [a Temple motif] and, through them, to the sanctuary and the throne of God.\\" A sister-sanctuary site to Beth-el 'House of God' (where Jacob and Levi experienced their own theophanies) was established at Dan-Hermon by Jeroboam after the Israelite kingdom divided, c. 930 BC. It was at Abel-ma√Æn that Levi, in vision, shepherded his flocks and was taken to the top of Sirion (Hermon), where he was clothed in the robes of the Holy Priesthood by seven white-clad archangels of light, who opened to him the gates of heaven ‚Äî from the sanctuary of which God appointed him to his high priestly office (Testament of Levi 2-5: a visionary ascent and commission that was actualized at Beth-el, Jubilees 32:1). It was also on the slopes of Hermon (Caesarea Philippi) that revelation-receptive Peter was commissioned by Christ, \\"the Son of the living God,\\" and where (by the greater consensus of scholars) Peter, James, and John were theophanic witnesses of the Transfiguration and of God's voice bearing witness of Christ's divine Sonship (2 Peter 1:16-18; Matt 16:13-19: reflecting the dualism of priesthood keys of power to 'bind' and 'loose' in earthly sanctuary and heavenly Temple, while rebuking, as does the Levi passage, Satan and his Hell; see Isaiah 22:22-24, where these binding keys \\"fasten ... as a nail in a sure place\\" upon which hangs kingly glory). Mountains of special designation, of course, were viewed by the ancients as 'temples' ‚Äî natural 'cosmic' portals connecting heaven and earth. The temple or holy mount was perceived as the earth-center omphalos 'naval' of an 'umbilical' conduit by which God nourished the creation. For Mount Hermon and Enoch, see especially Clifford's Cosmic Mountain (2010/1972), pp. 182-192.

The only solace that Enoch could therefore offer them at that point, for theirs appears to have been a point of 'no return,'\\"The summons to pray ... does not mean that the possibility of forgiveness is [now, as it once was,] being left open for Shemihazah and his companions. Rather, as in the Book of Watchers [of 1 Enoch], their praying is a sign of defeat signalling a contrast with the ultimate lot of earth's victims. Whereas the latter's [anguished, perishing] cries have been heeded [by Heaven], the Watchers' pleas for divine mercy for themselves and their children cannot escape the decisive results of divine judgment\\" (Stuckenbruck [1997], p. 93). was to \\"loosen your bonds (of sin) which tie you up ... and begin to pray.\\" The archangel Raphael (Metatron-Enoch) was, according to Milik, charged by God to bind Asael (or 'Azazel': Satan, Hanson describes the primordial myth of a \\"heavenly rebellion\\" of \\"astral deities\\" and a fallen astral-host ‚Äî \\"the divine rebels and their earthly successors\\" ‚Äî led by a morning-star figure (i.e., Lucifer 'son of the morning' = Satan/Satanael), whose aspirant ascent \\"in the subdued light of the morning [is] blotted out by the more brilliant light of the rising sun\\" (i.e., Yahweh ‚Äî the anglicized 'Jehovah' ‚Äî who in 1 En 10:11 uses Michael as His \\"divine agent\\" in the rebels' heavenly exile and punishment. The mighty archangel declares to Shemihazah, a leader of the fallen host: I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and the guardian [angels] drove you out from the midst of the stones of fire [stars, or astral deities] ... I cast you to the ground ... You have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever, pp. 207-209). Though ultimately cast from God's 'summit' and brought low, such arrogant presumption and ambition rises primevally to transcend the powers of Heaven in the spirit of Isaiah 14:13-14: I will ascend to heaven: I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, I will set my throne on high. I will sit on the mount of assembly in the far north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will make myself like the Most High. It is by this Urzeit connection to the prologue of creation, wherein a heavenly rebellion of divine beings occurs, that a fuller picture emerges for \\"an etiology of evil in the world: all of the evil in the world stems from a heavenly event, the rebellion of certain divine beings.\\" Likewise does the story of fallen Watchers and giants both elucidate and advance towards an eschatological \\"denouement\\" (Endzeit) because \\"extirpation of evil would not occur from within the world order, but through cataclysmic extension of primeval events, culminating in a purging of the evil angels and spirits and the restoration of a perfect order\\" (pp. 218-219).

Milik notes the word-play on the double meaning of the verb rafa 'to tie' and 'to heal.' Reflecting upon God's decree in rejecting the fallen angels' petition, Milik says that \\"the Watchers seemThat Milik here employs the word \\"seem\\" in referencing the fallen angels' bonds of \\"sin\\" indicates his understanding that the enslavement spoken of by Enoch is a spiritual bondage and dreadful promised fate that afflicts the fallen angels at this point in the narrative because of their vile crimes and deeds, as clearly the temporal retribution of heaven has not yet been carried out. The passage refers to the bonds of sin, not to physical bindings. to be already chained up by the [arch]angels; [for] in order to be able to pray, to lift their arms in the gesture of suppliants, they have to have their bonds loosened\\" ‚Äî that is, spiritually, if they will, through repentance (a genuine yearning for which, however, they appear to be 'past feeling' [Eph 4:19], and it is this stark reality of which Heaven is all too aware). > [Thereupon] the roaring of the wild beasts came and the multitude of the > wild animals began to cry out...

In the Manichaean Book of Giants, Milik explains, Raphael (Enoch's 'heavenly double')Mani, too, according to the biographical Cologne Mani-Codex, was in vision visited by his celestial or 'divine twin', a heavenly or pre-existent 'true self' ‚Äî a noted element in Jewish mysticism (but manifest also in the apocryphal Syriac Hymn of the Pearl at the end of the Acts of Thomas, preserved and treasured in Manichaeism) ‚Äî which alternately is thought to be the embodiment of what a 'son of God' (or true and faithful 'Watcher' as opposed to a 'child of Error') is meant to be, or to become. See Milik (1976), pp. 29, 34, 55, 142, 144, 172, 174, 192, 214, 229-230, 235-236, 427; Reeves (1992), pp. 35 note 13, 186-188; Stuckenbruck (1997), pp. 84 note 63, 88 note 71, and for Raphael, 93; Orlov (2005), pp. 165-176. Joseph Smith's 'restored' theology mentions the archangel Raphael canonically (D&C; 128:21) and holds the archangels Michael and Gabriel to be, in essence, the 'heavenly doubles' of the patriarchs Adam and Noah, respectively. See Smith's History of the Church 3:386. is the conqueror of Ohyah and of all the other Watchers and of their giant-sons. The same work intimates that all four archangels (Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Uriel)The Qumranic texts, as both Milik and Orlov note, variously, and secondarily, give Sariel or Phanuel's name in place of Uriel's. were engaged in the struggle with the 200 Watchers and their offspring: \\"and those two hundred demons fought a hard battle with the four angels, until the angels used fire, naphtha, and brimstone...\\"The great Paris Magical Papyrus of the fourth century gives a fascinating glimpse of divine retribution against the giant- rebels. Therein is recorded what is purported to be an ancient Hebrew prayer meant to exorcise demons in the holy name of \\"the god of the Hebrews ... the One who burned up the stubborn giants with lightning, whom the Heaven of heaven praises ... by the One who put the mountains [boundaries] around the sea [or] a wall of sand and commanded the sea not to overflow. The abyss obeyed, and you obey, every daimonic spirit ...\\" (cited in Murray [2007], pp. 91-92). The Enochic literature records the collusion of the archangels with the righteous (both seen and unseen - see 2 Kings 6:16) against their demon- foes: \\"Four hundred thousand Righteous ... [came] with fire, naphtha, and brimstone ... And the [fallen] angels moved out of sight of Enoch\\" (see Reeves, pp. 160‚Äì161 note 389; in the Book of Moses, at 7:14-15, the giants \\"stood afar off,\\" in \\"great fear\\" of Enoch and \\"the people of God\\"). Then, after the course of more than three hundred years dwelling amidst his \\"holy people\\" (Moses 7:18, 68-69), when the patriarch-warrior-king suddenly \\"was not; for God took him\\" (Genesis 5:24; see Reeves, p. 77),Targum Pseudo- Jonathan (v. 24) reads: \\"Enoch worshipped in truth before the Lord and behold he was not with the inhabitants of the earth because he was taken away and he ascended to the firmament at the command of the Lord, and he was called Metatron, the Great Scribe.\\" Compare Heb 11:5-6. See VanderKam (2008/1995), p. 167. the archangelic Raphael-Metatron sent to Shemihazah a warning-message that brought complete fulfilment to heaven's former decree: \\"The Holy One is about to destroy His world, and bring upon it a flood\\" (Milik, pp. 316 note 12, 328). The archangel Uriel, beyond his role of instructing Enoch among the stars,Fourth-century historian Eusebius quotes \\"On the Jews\\" by first-century BCE historian Alexander Polyhistor (112-30) in his Praeparatio Evangelica (9.17.1-9 Pseudo-Eupolemus frag 1; 9.18.2 frag 2) that the Hebrew patriarch Abraham, who taught astronomy first to the Phoenicians and then to the Egyptians, inherited his knowledge of the stars from the archangelic Wisdom legacy extending from Noah to Enoch, who \\"first discovered\\" the celestial sciences by Uriel's instruction; the ancients identified Enoch with the Titan Atlas, whom the Greeks said \\"discovered astrology\\" (9.17.9). See Stuckenbruck (2017/2014), pp. 7-12, 31-32; Abr 3. directs Noah to prepare his escape from the Flood, and figures prominently in the final Judgement of the world in the end times that will be administered by the 'Son of Man' figure as foretold in Enoch's Book of Dreams and Apocalypse of Weeks.The mighty archangel Uriel ('God-fire' or 'fire of God'; God's \\"Regent of the Sun,\\" \\"gloriously bright ... Interpreter ... Brightest Seraph\\" - Milton), as overseer of the 'heavenly bodies' of the cosmic creation and of the fallen angels of the underworld (1 En 20), was Enoch's \\"star\\" guide through the cosmos. He was also ‚Äî according to Jewish tradition, as a foremost Angel of the Presence, or high priest of the celestial Temple ‚Äî that great angel with flaming sword (a seraphic Watcher) placed by the gods to guard the gate to the pre-existent Edenic paradise and its Tree of Life (4 Ezra 3:5-6). Because of rebellion, archonic beings were, from their angelic stations or status, primordially \\"cast ... as profane out of the mountain of God ... from the midst of the stones of fire [from their positions amidst the stars, or from heaven's angelic host]\\" (Ezek 28:16). Uriel was set to ward off the demonic host (or those beings deemed unworthy, or unprepared) that might profane the sacred precinct. Uriel, who \\"helped Solomon repel demons from the Temple,\\" was that archangel who, as he did for Enoch but also for the prophet Ezra, acted as the \\"interpreter\\" of heaven-sent visions and books ‚Äî an \\"illuminator of the mind.\\" In the end times, it is said, Uriel will, in warning declaration, blow his archangelic trump to usher in the boiling, melting conflagration (Isa 64:2) set to accompany the coming of the 'Son of Man' to reign for a thousand years, then judge the world. The prophet Isaiah, speaking for the Lord of Hosts, declared: \\"Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work [of ingathering latter-day Israel; of defending God's elect against hostile or demonic powers]; and I have created the [archangelic] waster to destroy [in the cleansing inferno at earth's harvest]\\" (Isa 54:16). Jewish tradition's end-time \\"warrior\\" 'Messiah ben Joseph' is cast in very similar terms, or in like mold, to Uriel, who joins in raining \\"fire, naphtha, and brimstone\\" upon the Watchers and nephilim. As a messianic or forerunner figure, Ben Joseph serves well, in this sense, as an earthly referent or counterpart to the fire-of-God archangel: ultimately, Ben Joseph rains destruction on the wicked at end-times Jerusalem and calls forth in resurrection the spirits of the netherworld, over portions of which Uriel holds stewardship as cosmic warden. See Stephen Miller, The Book of Angels: Seen and Unseen (Cambridge Scholars Publishing: Newcastle upon Tyne, England, 2019), pp. 59-64; Margaret Barker, An Extraordinary Gathering of Angels (2004), pp. 66-67, 81-82, 102, 107, 400, 402-403, 412-413; and Mitchell (2016), pp. 182-183, 229. Two other archangels, Raguel and Phanuel (sometimes confused with the archangelic name-corruption 'Remiel' > Eremiel > Jeremiel),Elijah, among the few prophets explicitly referred to in the Enochic writings (1 En 89:52), is Enoch's 'translated' colleague, but possibly also the archangel Phanuel, who, quite appropriately after Enoch's own translation, is one of three angels who take him atop the heavenly temple ‚Äî whereupon one of the angels (Elijah-Phanuel?) directs Enoch to witness the great diluvial Judgement poured out upon the Earth's inhabitants (1 En 87:3-4). In early Jewish and Christian traditions, Elijah is often mentioned in this 'deathless' context with Enoch, which has given rise to the belief that this prophetic duo ‚Äî both of whom were 'taken' by God to heaven without tasting death ‚Äî are the two witnesses spoken of at Revelation 11 who return to testify and wage war in Jerusalem at the last day, but who are ultimately martyred, then resurrected. See VanderKam (2008/1995), pp. 69, 85, 116-117, 141, 180-182. are also mentioned in the Enochic material. With respect to the archangel Sariel (a name sometimes given in the Qumranic texts as taking the place of Uriel or Phanuel), it is the Manichaean tradition, drawing on the Book of Giants, that preserves that archangelic name more faithfully than do the Greek and Ethiopic traditions. The Qumran Book of Giants, like its Manichaean counterpart, affiliates the names of the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh and the monster Humbaba with the Watchers and giants. Interpretive issues between Qumran and Turfan Although we can glean much information from the fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls narrative, there are still many unknowns and issues that scholars heavily debate. Clearly, the authorship of the Qumran Book of Giants is still a question among scholars. Some initially believed that the manuscript (despite so many extant copies from Qumran of the overall Enochic work) to have been little used among the desert sectaries; but more recent scholarship declares: \\"We know that the Qumran Essenes copied, studied, and valued the writings and teachings ascribed to Enoch\\" (VanderKam, 2008/1995, p. 143). The Qumran discoveries decidedly ruled out any possibility that the Manicheans were the composers of the Book of Giants, for their work followed later. However, the historical transmission of 1 Enoch assumes that the basis of the text must likewise fall to unknown authors, or tend to the idea that it was a pseudepigraphon text. For some scholars, this lends itself, as such texts invariably have, to questioning the originality and legitimacy of the book. But bearing in mind the eleven Enochic manuscripts discovered at Qumran, which contain one or several of the various Enochic 'booklets' known there ‚Äî totals \\"higher than for most of the books that became parts of the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament,\\" and recalling also \\"the cost and labor involved in producing a manuscript in antiquity\\" ‚Äî such inordinate numbers representing the Enochic stockpile \\"say much about the value accorded\\" such writings (VanderKam, 2008/1995, p. 184). As far as comparisons that might be made with 'canonical' texts, the books of Daniel and 1 Enoch both have similarities (to give just one of many possible parallels) in their visionary elements: taking up the visions of both Daniel and Enoch, or even of the giants Ohyah, Hahyah, and Mahway. Indeed, Stuckenbruck suggests that \\"these similarities ... allow for the possibility that the author of Daniel 7 knew the early Enochic traditions well enough to draw on and then adapt them for his own purposes. Nowhere is this clearer than in the throne-theophany itself\\" (p. 119). The biblical and apocryphal accounts speak of a king of heaven sitting upon his throne, and the Aramaic text A12 has other corresponding elements. The texts differ, however, in that, in the giants' account, God comes down from heaven. Several such textual variants of the different 'Book of Giants' versions, moreover, raise many other points of ongoing debate among scholars and experts. For although all are said to derive in some measure from the same 'script,' they are, ultimately, very different in their content, particularly in the way that the Manichaean and Aramaic versions differ ‚Äî even from later Jewish midrash retellings ‚Äî in the elements of the giants' dreams or visions. In the giant Ohyah's dream, for instance, he apparently sees a large inscribed-stone representation of the 'Book of Life' (from the inclusion in which, by defilement, the names of nearly all of Earth's inhabitants are forfeited) and/or the 'cosmic covenant' (which the Watchers and their offspring, by their defilement, have broken) that covers the whole earth \\"like a table.\\"Such a \\"table\\" ‚Äî according to the Latin Life of Adam and Eve (50:1-3; 51:9) ‚Äî appears to have taken two earthly forms in order to ensure its preservation ‚Äî to make one or the other indestructible, or impervious to God's great Judgements of water and fire. Eve, upon her deathbed, instructs her son Seth to make \\"tablets of stone and other tablets of clay [containing their history but also \\"what Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied before the Flood\\"]. If he [God] should judge our race by water, the tablets of earth will dissolve and the tablets of stone will remain; but if he should judge our race by fire, the tablets of stone will break up and those of clay will be thoroughly baked\\" (the tablets are preserved by two archangels in 2 Enoch). In the midrash retelling, a great angel descends, but in the Qumranic version, the Lord of Heaven himself descends with a knife to scrape and efface all of its character-rows, save one, at the end of which only four words remain (the names of Noah and his three sons). J.T. Milik believed the Book of Giants originally to have been a part of the entire Enochic work, the five-sectioned 'Enochic Pentateuch' as it is sometimes called, including the Book of Watchers, the Astronomical Book, the Book of Dreams, and the Epistle of Enoch (with its Apocalypse of Weeks); Milik felt that the Qumran Giants had actually been replaced by the Ethiopic 1 Enoch's 'Similitudes' (or 'Parables') section. All of these Enochic writings would have held significance from the beginning of the first century. Indeed, the early Christian church treasured Enoch and held it canonical. However, during the Christian era after the Apostles, the collection was altered and part of its narrative (Giants, it is thought) replaced by the Book of Parables.Milik, J. T., ed. (1976). The Books of Enoch: Aramaic Fragments of Qumran Cave 4. London: Clarendon Press. pp. 43, 58, 92, 109-110, 113, 158, 171, 254, 300-316, 320, 328, 336-338. Also, due in no small part to the influence of the Alexandrian philosophers who ill-favored it ‚Äî its contents thought by many of the Hellenistic era to be foolish or strange ‚Äî the overall Enochic work rapidly ran afoul of ideas held by the Christian and Jewish doctors, who damned it forever as a tainted product of the Essenes of Qumran.Bearing upon the scholars' above-mentioned suspicion of Hebraic foundations of the Enochic literature is Adolf Jellinek's insinuation or anticipation in 1853 ‚Äî nearly one hundred years before the mid-20th century Qumran discoveries ‚Äî when he suggested (in retrospect, rather startlingly) that the book of Enoch was an Essene creation! See Adolf Jellinek, \\"Hebr√§ische Quellen f√ºr das Buch Henoch,\\" Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft 7 (1853): 249. Milik has speculated the reason why the book was censored by Christian authors was its popular usage by Manichaeans.Gedaliahu A. Guy Stroumsa, Guy G. Stroumsa, Another Seed: Studies in Gnostic Mythology, 1984, Brill, The book was soon banned by such orthodox authorities as Hilary, Jerome, and Augustine in the fourth century and it gradually passed out of circulation, finally becoming lost to the knowledge of Western Christendom ‚Äî only sundry 'fragments' remained.Barker, Margaret. (2005) [1987]. \\"The Book of Enoch,\\" in The Older Testament: The Survival of Themes from the Ancient Royal Cult in Sectarian Judaism and Early Christianity. London: SPCK; Sheffield Phoenix Press. The few copies left of the Enoch literature, if indeed they could be found, was therefore attributable, it is thought, to the Christian doctors' suppression of it and their partial replacement with the Book of Parables.Even so, contrary to J. T. Milik's original assessment of a very late 270 CE date for the Enochic fragments at Qumran, scholarly consensus (by setting the date for the Book of Parables, rather, right at the turn of the Christian Era) overturns the idea that 'Similitudes' was a \\"late Christian document\\". The Parables section was wholly absent from the Qumran fragments in which were represented portions of all of 1 Enoch's other sections. But this was because (with the exception of the Qumran community's own sectarian literature) \\"no document whatsoever, written after the end of the second century BCE [in fact, probably not exceeding 150 BCE, per VanderKam], managed to find its way into the Qumran library\\"; all of 1 Enoch's other sections (or 'booklets') were written before 'Similitudes' between the second and fourth centuries BCE and were, therefore, found (in abundance) at Qumran.

He received a Calouste Gulbenkian award in 1972 to complete a photographic study of young people within an inner city setting and the resulting exhibition travelled the UK and appeared in several major galleries for the next eighteen months. Publishing career Oakes has written two books; Dragon's Eye: A Chinese Noir, published in 2003, and Citizen One, which was released in 2007. He is credited with the instigation of the 'Chinese noir' genre, in which the People's Republic of China's politics are viewed in the setting of a crime-thriller. Both books deal with Human Rights issues in China, in a political/crime thriller setting where alienation and the shadow of the state loom large. Oakes has extensive experience travelling in the People's Republic of China. Dragon's Eye won the Euroropean Crime and Mystery Award in Paris in 2004, and centres upon the controversial organ transplant system within China. Citizen One is a fast moving crime and political thriller which deals with a host of issues including vice, transgenic crops, gendercide and the cult of the 'princeling' children of wealthy cadre in the People's Republic of China. Both of his books have received positive reviews. Dragon's Eye is as fine a debut novel as I've seen in years.

Johnson, known as Big Jack Johnson (July 30, 1939 or 1940 ‚Äì March 14, 2011) was an American electric blues musician, one of the \\"present-day exponents of an edgier, electrified version of the raw, uncut Delta blues sound.\\" He was one of a small number of blues musicians who played the mandolin. He won a W. C. Handy Award in 2003 for best acoustic blues album. Biography Johnson was born in Lambert, Mississippi, in 1940, one of 18 children in his family. His father, Ellis Johnson, was a sharecropper, and his family picked cotton, but he was also a professional musician, leading a band at local functions and playing fiddle and mandolin in country and blues styles. Big Jack got his start in music playing with his father. In his teens, he began playing the electric guitar, attracted to the urban sound of B.B. King. Johnson was nicknamed \\"The Oil Man\\", because of his day job as a truck driver for Shell Oil. He was the father of 13 children. His earliest professional playing, apart from his father's band, was with Earnest Roy, Sr., C. V. Veal & the Shufflers, and Johnny Dugan & the Esquires. In 1962, Johnson, Sam Carr and Frank Frost formed the Jelly Roll Kings and the Nighthawks, in which Johnson played bass, releasing two albums, Hey Boss Man (1962) and My Back Scratcher (1966). Johnson's first recordings as a vocalist are on the 1979 album Rockin' the Juke Joint Down, issued by Earwig Music. With Frost as the bandleader, they performed and recorded together for 15 years. Johnson's first solo album, The Oil Man, including the song \\"Catfish Blues\\", was released by Earwig in 1987. He recorded solo and as a member of the Jelly Roll Kings and Big Jack Johnson and the Oilers (with the poet and musician Dick Lourie). He wrote and performed \\"Jack's Blues\\" and performed \\"Catfish Medley\\" with Samuel L. Jackson on the soundtrack of the film Black Snake Moan. His album Daddy, When Is Mama Comin Home? (1990) presents social concerns. He subsequently performed and recorded with his band, the Cornlickers, with Dale Wise on drums, Dave Groninger on guitar, Tony Ryder on bass, and Bobby Gentilo on guitar. They recorded the albums Katrina (2009) and Big Jack's Way (2012). Johnson died from an undisclosed illness on March 14, 2011. According to family members, he had struggled with health problems in his final years, worsening to the point that there were erroneous reports of his death in the days leading up to it. Johnson was posthumously honored with a plaque on the Clarksdale Walk of Fame in August 2011. He also has a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Clarksdale.

The lake is within both Herkimer and Hamilton counties, and covers portions of the towns of Webb and Long Lake. Located southwest of the lake is the hamlet of Big Moose. The lake's popularity derives from its remoteness, climate and beauty. It was the scene of the murder of Grace Brown in 1906 by her boyfriend. Alleged spectral sightings and subsequent media attention are said to have added to the allure.

Last accessed September 2, 2006. Communities and recreation Located southwest of the lake is the hamlet of Big Moose; other nearby communities include Eagle Bay, Inlet, Old Forge, and Thendara. With minimal road access, the lake's shore had not been developed very much. The population reaches a peak during the summer months, when vacationers arrive to stay at summer homes or local resorts. The lake and its surrounding region are a popular spot for tourists year-round; boating, water-skiing, hiking and train rides from Thendara are available in the summer, and cross-country skiing and snowmobiling take place in the winter. It is home to the Big Moose Water Ski Club, whose members are residents of the region. The Pigeon Lake Wilderness Area lies just east of the lake. Fishing Big Moose lake also offers sport fishing opportunities for brook trout, lake trout, yellow perch, brown trout, and splake. There is a no state-owned boat launch; however, a commercial marina with a ramp is located on the south shore of West Bay. History Vertical, half-log (palisade) architecture at Covewood Lodge The lake's region was settled by European Americans primarily during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as people gained access to the region by the first railroad constructed through the uninhabited Adirondack wilderness. Early trappers and hunters of the Adirondacks became guides there, eventually establishing permanent camps and hotels. Wealthy businessmen built large, private summer homes and their families lived here for the season, in the style of the Great Camps of the Vanderbilts and Morgans. Some of these lodges still exist. The Big Moose Lake area is historically significant for its palisade architectural style, which used vertical half-log construction in lodges and cabins. The Glenmore, from a 1907 postcard. Representation in culture Big Moose Lake was the setting of An American Tragedy, a novel by Theodore Dreiser. He based his book on the historic events of the drowning murder of Grace Brown in the South Bay of Big Moose Lake in the early part of the 20th century. Her boyfriend Chester Gillette was convicted and executed for her murder. (Dreiser named the lake where the murder took place as Big Bittern Lake, after having visited Big Moose Lake.) and used it as a model for his fictional version.) A Place in the Sun, a film starring Elizabeth Taylor, Shelley Winters, and Montgomery Clift, was an adaptation of the novel. Claims of ghost sightings around the lake and associated with Grace Brown continue to be recorded. In 1996, the television series Unsolved Mysteries aired an episode that reenacted the events. It reported two such ghost sightings. On July 11, 2006 some residents organized a wreath-laying ceremony on South Bay to memorialize the centennial of Brown's murder. People participated from a small flotilla of watercraft. Jennifer Donnelly based her historical novel, A Northern Light (2003), on this murder. She explores events from the perspective of a young girl working at the Glenmore (a lodge on the lake). Robert Tucker also set his novel, Sasquatch Camp (2013,) in this community. =Historic places= The following places are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: *Covewood Lodge (listed in 2004) *Big Moose Community Chapel (listed in 2012) Gallery Big Moose Lake.jpgBig Moose Lake viewed from Covewood Lodge Big Moose Lake Postcard.jpgPostcard from 1930-1945 of Big Moose Lake Lake View Lodge, Big Moose, N.Y LCCN2007661121.tifLake View Lodge, the first luxury hotel, built 1898 (1911 photo) References Further reading * External linksPeople v.

It was a time of hardship, compounded by foreign invasion, making this a grey region of Sri Lanka's history.

In chronological order they were: Alvin the Aardvark and the Fuzzy Ants, The Umbrella, The Pete Shelley Group, The Cure, Luxuria, Apollo 440, Stealth Sonic Soul, Fast, Maximum Roach, James Maker and Noko 440 (also known as Frankenstein), Magazine, Raw Chimp, Levyathan, SCISM, Am I Dead Yet? and The Buzzcocks (at the Pete Shelley Memorial concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in 2019). Biography In 1980, he formed his first band called Alvin the Aardvark & the Fuzzy Ants, who played their first gig on 16 January 1981 on After All That‚Ä¶This, a Granada TV show presented by Nick Turnbull. Despite the DJ John Peel being a fan of their music, they never released any material, recording only an unreleased single at Open Eye Studios, in Liverpool and playing a few gigs in the North-West, most notably supporting Cabaret Voltaire at Nathan McGough's Plato's Ballroom in 1981, before disbanding the same year. In 1983, he became involved with three bands. He joined The Cure as bassist, playing for some European and UK live‚ÄìTV dates, and formed two bands, Dynamo Futurista and The Umbrella. The latter group, consisting of Noko (guitar and vocals), Simon Hoare (drums), Mark Sanderson (bass) and James Gardner, released a total of three songs before folding, which were released on an EP called Make Hell (For The Beautiful People). Founder Buzzcock and Magazine frontman, Howard Devoto, started writing with Noko in 1986 with a view to putting a band together to play Factory Records' Festival of the Tenth Summer at the G-Mex arena in Manchester that summer to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Punk. They played a short set as Adultery, borrowing backline from The Smiths. (Noko also played a set with Pete Shelley at the same gig in a line-up that also included ex-Magazine drummer John Doyle). The line-up for that Adultery show was: Howard Devoto ‚Äì vocals, Noko ‚Äì lead guitar/viola, Leroy James ‚Äì keyboards/2nd guitar, Pete Kinski ‚Äì bass, Simon Hoare ‚Äì drums. Signing to Beggars Banquet in 1987 and deciding on the name Luxuria, Devoto and Noko released two LPs: Unanswerable Lust (1988) and Beastbox (1990) and toured Europe and USA throughout 1988 with a line-up of Devoto and Noko on vocals/guitars and viola as usual and Karl Leiker ‚Äì bass, Mark Rowlett ‚Äì Drums/Sequential Studio 440, James Gardner ‚Äì keyboards, programming, Frog ‚Äì guitar/keyboards. The final Luxuria gig at The Town & Country Club (now the London Forum) in London featured cameo appearances by Barry Adamson (bass) on a rendition of Magazine's \\"The Light Pours Out of Me\\" for an encore, and Morrissey, who read a passage of Marcel Proust's \\"A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu\\" over the intro of \\"Mademoiselle\\" before throwing the tattered book into the crowd as the band kicked into the song. (There is a bootleg recording of the gig in circulation). When Luxuria folded in 1990, Noko got together with school friends, brothers Trevor Gray and Howard Gray, and James Gardner and formed Apollo 440. The band released a number of singles and EPs on their own StealthSonic Recordings label: \\"Lolita\\" (1990), \\"Destiny\\" (1991), \\"Blackout\\" (1992) and \\"Lolita/Destiny '92\\" (1992). Apollo 440 made four albums: Millennium Fever (1995), ElectroGlide In Blue (1997), Gettin' High On Your Own Supply (1999), and Dude Descending A Staircase (2003) on Sony Records. The band have been playing live in one form or another since their inception in 1990 to the present day and chronologically the touring line-ups are as follows: 1990‚Äì1992: The band featured all founding members on keyboards, sequencers and drum machines and MCs Stevie Hyper-D and Tigga-Max guesting from time to time on vocals. 1993‚Äì1995: James Gardner left for New Zealand where he has since established himself as a prominent composer writing music for his ensemble 175 East. Noko moved over to electric guitar and lead vocals, Trevor Gray on keyboards, Howard Gray on bass, and ex-Modern Eon drummer Cliff Hewitt was added to the line-up first on electronic, then onto acoustic drums. (Kenny Cougar briefly replaced Rej on bass during 1999). 1996‚Äì2000: Noko ‚Äì guitar, Trevor Gray ‚Äì keyboards, Howard Gray ‚Äì vibe controller/live-mix, Cliff Hewitt ‚Äì drums, Paul Kodish ‚Äì drums, Reinallt Ap Gwynnedd ‚Äì bass, Mary Byker (ex-Gaye Bykers on Acid) ‚Äì lead vocals, Harry-K ‚Äì DJ/vocals. Simeon Bowring from A1 People replaced Rej on bass for a number of European festivals in 2000. 2007‚Äì2008: Noko ‚Äì guitar, Trevor Gray ‚Äì keyboards, Howard Gray ‚Äì vibe controller/live-mix. Cliff Hewitt ‚Äì drums, Reinallt Ap Gwynnedd ‚Äì bass, Ewan MacFarlane ‚Äì lead vocals, Ashley Krajewski ‚Äì MPC/keyboards. 2008‚Äìpresent: Chuck Sabo briefly replaced Cliff Hewitt on drums in 2008 (and again in 2009) as Cliff had touring commitments with German artist Schiller; Steve Barney did the same in early 2010 and Mikey Cusick (who had previously played with Noko in Maximum Roach from 2004‚Äì2005) replaced Rej on bass in 2008 and remains the current Apollo 440 bassman. The current 2010 Apollo 440 touring line-up: Noko ‚Äì guitar, Trevor Gray ‚Äì keyboards, Howard Gray ‚Äì vibe controller/live-mix. Cliff Hewitt ‚Äì drums, Mikey Cusick ‚Äì bass/vocals, Ewan MacFarlane ‚Äì lead vocals, Ashley Krajewski ‚Äì MPC/keyboards/vocals. 2004 saw Noko in a two-man band with James Maker which was at first called Frankenstein, but which was later renamed to James Maker and Noko 440. The band released only one EP via Morrissey's Attack imprint (I'm Unbearable/Born That Way) and the two musicians parted early 2005 after touring with a full band line-up on Morrissey's European and UK dates including his Meltdown festival appearance at the Royal Festival Hall supporting the newly reformed New York Dolls. That line-up included Paul Kodish on drums, Simeon Bowring on bass, and Ashley Krajewski on keyboards. In November 2008, Noko was announced as the guitarist of the reformed Magazine, joining his former collaborators Howard Devoto, Barry Adamson, John Doyle and Dave Formula. In summer 2009, Magazine played \\"The Soap Show: Episode 2009\\" at the Royal Festival Hall. It was shown in two halves, the first of which was The Correct Use Of Soap LP in its original running order followed by the B-sides and the song \\"Upside Down\\" which had never been performed live before. They also played selected European festivals with a set culled from the \\"Real Life & Thereafter\\" tour. The band rounded off the year's activities with appearances on BBC TV's Later... with Jools Holland and the BBC Electric Proms. Magazine have released a brand new live DVD and CD, Real Life & Thereafter: Live at Manchester Academy 17.02.09. 2009 also saw the completion and release of Noko's first full movie score. Une Affaire D'etat, a French-language political thriller based on best-selling novel Nos Fantastiques Ann√©es Fric by Dominique Manotti was directed by √âric Valette and stars Andr√© Dussollier, Thierry Fr√©mont and Rachida Brakni. European cinema release was in October of that year. A soundtrack CD is available on Milan Musique. 2010 also saw the formation of Raw Chimp with Noko (guitar/vocals), his wife Deborah Fisher-Jones (bass), and Constance Kaler (lead vocals). Raw Chimp played their live debut that same year at the Download Festival. Noko also scored √âric Valette's next movie, The Prey which was released in France in April 2011 with worldwide distribution to follow later in 2012. Another French-language thriller, it was written by Laurent Turner and the movie's producer Luc Bossi, The Prey stars Albert Dupontel, Alice Taglioni, St√©phane Debac and Sergi Lopez. It's a dark high-octane edgy chase movie starting in a prison and culminating in a tense mountain denouement. The score is essential orchestral with touches of electronica and a multitude of Noko's trademark guitar-textures. The soundtrack CD is again available on Milan Musique. Magazine completed their No Thyself LP at the end of 2011, the first new material from the band since 1981's Magic, Murder and the Weather, which was released on the Wire-Sound label. The band toured the UK in November. The LP and tour and BBC radio session were the first to feature new bass-player Stan White who replaced Barry Adamson. Apollo 440's fifth LP The Future's What It Used to Be was released at the beginning of 2012 and the group continue to play live. In 2012, Noko stepped in on bass guitar and backing vocals with London neo-grunge trio Levyathan, alongside Simon Maxwell on drums and David Norris on guitar and lead vocals. The band recorded a Noko-produced debut LP later that year at Apollo Control but it was never released. In February 2013, Noko and Brad Lee from Discoordinated performed at Matthew Glamorre's multi- media series of art-happenings, C.R.U.X. at Zero-One Gallery in Hopkins St. Soho, London W1. They revisited their 2-man version of Roxy Music's classic, \\"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\\", last performed in 2007. In March 2013, Noko composed and performed his one-man live music score on electric guitar to Theatre Of Post Eroticism's production of BDSM Faust : an adaption of Johann Wolfgang Goethe's 1808 \\"Faust\\" (Part 1). There was another UK run of the production in June and the show was performed in Romania later in the year. In 2014, Noko co-wrote/ co-produced some tracks for Japanese guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei's LP New Beginnings (released in Japan Virgin/Universal TYCT-60046). These were \\"Sons Of Sorrow\\", \\"New Chemical\\" and \\"Barrel Of My Own Gun\\". Noko played bass guitar on \\"Sons Of Sorrow\\" and \\"Barrel Of My Own Gun\\" and vocals on \\"Barrel of my own Gun\\" and \\"New Chemical\\". When Hotei later signed to Universal's Spinefarm imprint, this LP was repackaged with some extra tracks for release outside of Japan as Strangers (SPINE663762) and included a re- worked version of \\"New Chemical\\" titled \\"Move It\\", featuring a lead vocal by Richard Z. Kruspe from Rammstein. It was at Noko's suggestion that Hotei approached Iggy Pop to sing two other tracks on the album, which became \\"How The Cookie Crumbles\\" and \\"Walking Through The Night\\". Hotei and Noko have been friends since 1997, first meeting when Apollo 440 remixed one of Hotei's tracks. They share a birthday, having both been born on exactly the same day, 1 February 1962. Since 2014 Noko has periodically toured with Hotei in Europe, U.S. and Japan, playing bass guitar in various line-ups, including drummers Steve Barney, Cliff Hewitt and Zachary Alford. Later in 2014, Noko produced and mixed Pop Will Eat Itself's \\"Reclaim The Game (Funk FIFA)\\" unofficial Brazil World Cup 2014 theme featuring Brazilian rap artist BNeg√£o. Noko went on to produce and mix some tracks for the band's 2015 Anti-Nasty League album (RUMJOINT0005): \\"Sacrifice And Pain\\", \\"Director's Cut\\" and \\"Mental Pollution\\" (to which he had a writing contribution), playing additional guitar, bass and various keyboard/programming enhancements along the way. This led to the band he formed with Brad Lee, $HirtLiftA supporting PWEI on their UK tour that summer: Brad Lee on vocals, Noko on guitar and Frank Horovich on guitar and electronics. In 2016, Noko reunited with Matthew Glamorre to form SCISM, the 'house-band' at his SCISM audio-visual, multi-media art-happening nightclub on EU Referendum night in London. They recorded and released \\"Dalston Bump\\" to coincide with a series of events at Vogue Fabrics in Dalston. In Summer 2017 SCISM played a set at Churchtown festival in Cornwall and again in September at The Bargehouse in London as part of Open London weekend. In April 2017, Magazine released the vinyl-only \\"Old World Charm\\" (WIRED42) : 6 tracks recorded at the BBC Electric Proms at Roundhouse, London in 2009. The Graeme Oxby pic on the rear of the sleeve featured Noko's MXR 'flanger-on-a-stick'. Noko composed and produced the music score for director Darren Cavanagh's feature-length documentary Ex-Dominatrix, for release in December 2017. The movie opened the 2019 London Fetish Film Festival, at which it won Best Feature. In 2017, Noko and Mary Byker started work recording a body of songs that would become the debut Am I Dead Yet? album, which was released on the Wire-Sound label in April 2019 (WIRED#48). A 5-track remix EP, ‚ÄúNever Mind The Bolex‚Ä¶Am I Dead Yet? reimagined on 35mm‚Äù(WIRED#49), which featured cinematic dub remixes of some of the album highlights, was released as a download only, free with advance-orders of the album during the crowd-fun run-up to the actual release. Live dates promoting the album saw the live line-up expanded with the addition of Cliff Hewitt from Apollo 440 on drums and Derek ‚ÄòHoodlum Priest‚Äô Thompson on bass guitar. Other appearances The nature of the Apollo 440 remix and production process means Noko has played on too many records by other artists to list usefully here. StealthSonicSoul was an alter- ego spin-off project by the three members of Apollo 440. One release \\"StealthSonicSoul\\" came out in 1992 on Scottish 23rd Precinct affiliated Limbo label. A further track \\"StealthSonic Sun In Her Hair\\" appeared on a Limbo compilation the following year. The EZ Drum & Bass Orchestra consisted of Noko and Frederick Pasquan and made one commercially available EP \\"Beat Girl\\" b/w \\"EZ Beat Girl\\" and \\"Slow Beat Girl\\" on the Sliced label in 1996. The duo also remixed a number of other artists e.g. \\"Carrerra Rapida -EZ Drum&Bass; Orchestra Remix\\" by Apollo 440 on Sony in 1997. Noko played bass in 1991 on the Total Abandon EP and Jubilee Twist LP in 1992 by The Heart Throbs, a group from Reading who folded in 1993. Noko played a number of gigs with the band in 1991 and was in the line up that was joined onstage on 25 October of that year by Only Ones frontman, Peter Perrett at Underworld, Camden Town,London, for a version of The Only Ones' \\"Lovers Of Today\\" along with a few other songs. In the same year, he played abstract guitar on the song \\"Ventriloquists and Dolls\\" from Momus's album Hippopotamomus. In 1992, Noko produced the one and only LP by Hyperhead, Metaphasia, which came out on the Devotion label. The band was formed by Mary Byker. After Gaye Bykers on Acid split, Mary joined and toured with industrial supergroup Pigface before forming Hyperhead, which included contributions from his Pigface colleagues Martin Atkins (also formerly of PiL and Killing Joke) and William Tucker (also previously of Revolting Cocks and My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult), along with bassist Karl Leiker (who had previously played with Noko in Luxuria) and guitarist Paul Dalloway. Also in 1992, Noko collaborated with Stuart Crichton as Johnny Potatohead, releasing a single, \\"Johnny Potatohead\\" on Reverb Records. On 14 July 1998, Apollo 440 played \\"La Nuit Electronique\\" concert with Jean Michel Jarre, with whom they had collaborated twice that year : firstly on the single \\"Rendezvous '98\\" (which became the ITV World Cup Theme in UK and reached #10 in the singles chart) and an @440 remix of \\"Oxygene 10\\". Apollo performed the two tracks live onstage with JMJ in front of the Eiffel Tower to an audience of over 600,000. It was Bastille Day and only two days before, France had won the World Cup. Immediately after they won on 12th, the Mayor of Paris asked Jarre to put together this impromtu free concert for the people of Paris to extend the euphoria. At the climax of the show, an enormous firework display went off on the Eiffel tower behind the stage. This was the largest concert Noko has ever played. Noko and both Gray brothers all played synthesiser and Jean Michel Jarre played theremin. From 2002‚Äì2004, Noko was involved as Producer/Musical Director for The Prada Meinhof Gang, an all-female Art- Terrorist troupe active between 2002‚Äì2004, whose activities included performance/installations at the Venice Biennalle, Tate Britain, ICA etc. Their track \\"Want Is Your Master\\" was included on the free CD compilation that accompanied the \\"Music\\" issue of Modern Painters magazine. In March 2007, Apollo 440 played the \\"A Tribute To Billy MacKenzie\\" charity concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire alongside British Electric Foundation (their first ever live show),Glenn Gregory (Heaven 17), Claudia Br√ºcken (Propaganda) and Paul Humphries (OMD) and Paul Haig, amongst others. It was 10 years after his death. Apollo, with Ewan MacFarlane on vocals closed the show with \\"Pain In Any Language\\" from their 2nd LP Electroglide In Blue. This collaboration was the last song MacKenzie finished before his tragic suicide only weeks later. The Apollo set also included their cover of The Smiths' \\"William, it was really nothing\\" - the only time it was ever performed live. Noko made his feature-film debut with a brief cameo appearance as an accordion-playing Parisian street musician in √âric Valette's Une Affaire D'Etat movie in 2009. He also had a cameo in √âric Valette's next movie La Proie in 2011 as a harpsichord player in a music-recital scene set in a prison which culminates in a full-scale riot. In 2011, Noko contributed guitar to two tracks on The Organ Of Corti, an LP by Magazine's Dave Formula and cellist Christine Hanson. After the passing of Pete Shelley in December 2018, Noko was asked to perform with the current Buzzcocks, Steve Diggle, Danny Farrant and Chris Remington, at a special memorial concert at London's Royal Albert Hall on 21 June. The concert featured original Buzzcocks drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey alongside a number of special guests, including Pauline Murray (Penetration), Captain Sensible (The Damned), Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), Peter Perrett (The Only Ones), Richard Jobson (Skids), Dave Vanian (The Damned) and Tim Burgess (The Charlatans). Noko played Pete Shelley's guitar parts and solos for the duration of the show, which was MC'd by Paul Morley and included tributes by original Buzzcocks manager and New Hormones label founder Richard Boon, original Buzzcock Howard Devoto, who provided a short film featuring a world premiere of a Buzzkunst track that he'd recorded with Pete, but was never released and, to end the show, a eulogy and special thanks from Pete's wife Greta. Appropriately, Noko played two songs, \\"Boredom\\" and \\"Time's Up\\" on a red 1960s Starway guitar - the same model made famous by Pete during the early Spiral Scratch days of the band, with its missing top- section. Equipment For Apollo 440 live, throughout the late 1990s Noko used the following guitars: a green Parker Fly Classic, a blue Parker Fly Deluxe and a pink Fender 1962 reissue Stratocaster through a pair of Digitech 2112 rack FX units, an 1980s Roland GP-8 and Fender Twins, but whilst the guitars remain the same, the preamps have been upgraded to Digitech GSP 1101 units with Control 2 foot controller through either a Marshall JCM2000 TSL through a Marshall 1960AX 4x12\\" cab or a Marshall EL34 50/50 power-amp and a pair of 4x12\\"s Noko's 2017 @440 rig was the same 3 guitars into a Kemper Powerack (Fender Tube Reverb tank in FX loop) into a Marshall 1936 2 x 12\\" cab with a pedalboard incorporating Kemper Remote, a Boss DM-3 and a Boss FT-2 in conjunction with 2 EV-5 expression pedals. While he was touring with Magazine in 2009, Noko used a pair of green Yamaha SG1500 guitars with an MXR dyna comp, MXR flanger, Boss DM-3 and Boss PS-5. The flanger was stand-mounted as per John McGeoch and Robin Simon's setup with the band in the late 1970s.Magazine : Noko / Ipso Facto For amplification, Noko used two late 1970s Marshall JMP 2x12\\" combos with Marshall 4x12'cabinets and a Fender Twin. A Variax 700 Acoustic was used for the intro of \\"I Want To Burn Again\\" through another late 1970s MXR flanger. Noko used a 1978 Black Ovation Magnum II bass guitar with Levyathan through a Boss CE-2 and boss OC-2 into a Sansamp Bass Driver and EBS Fafner Bass rig. A jetglow '74 Rickenbacker 4001 was used for one or two gigs during his time with the band. Whilst on tour with Tomoyasu Hotei, Noko's bass rig was as follows : Ibanez Black Eagle(Reissue), 1978 Antoria Snow Eagle, 1982 G&L; L-1000(natural), 1978 Ovation Magnum II (black) into : EBS Fafner MkI through EBS Neo 210 and EBS Neo 115 cabs, with the top- end (up an octave through electroharmonix POG2) split through Kemper Powerack into Marshall 1936 cab. Noko's 2019 live rig for both Apollo 440 and Am I Dead Yet? is the same 3 guitars into the Kemper and either a Mission Engineering Gemini GM-2 FRFR system, or a Matrix GT800FX stereo power amp and stereo Marshall 1960 4x12\\"cab(s) for international shows. His pedalboard now includes an Xotic EP boost and the Boss FT-2 and Fender reverb tank have gone. Two Gretsch White Falcons (single and double cut-aways) were used extensively during the making of the Am I Dead Yet? album, but not live shows, so far. For the Pete Shelley Memorial show with The Buzzcocks at London's Royal Albert Hall, he used Pete's old Marshall JCM-900 and a sunburst late '70s Ibanez AR-300 Artist, his green Yamaha SG-1500 and a red 1960s Starway J-1. The only pedals were MXR Flanger, Xotic EP boost and Boss Hyper Fuzz.

Background In May 1971 Vangelis had played several sessions in London's Marquee Studios, joined for some of them by violinist Michel Ripoche, bass guitarist Brian Odgers (called Odger on the sleeve) and drummer Tony Oxley, the rhythm section of the famous Extrapolation recording released by John McLaughlin. Two albums' worth of material had resulted from these sessions, but were unfinished and not intended for release. Later, when Vangelis was becoming famous, the label published the material without his permission, using forged signatures, and in 1978 two albums appeared in shops, on the Affinity label (a subsidiary of Charly Records) - Hypothesis and The Dragon. Vangelis won a court case to have both LPs taken off the market. He said greed was the motivation for releasing the sub-par albums: \\"I don't agree with that music at all.\\" Overview The album takes the form of an extended jam session of experimental jazz. An alternative release of Hypothesis was titled Visions of the Future. In Germany Hypothesis and The Dragon were issued together as a double album titled Portrait.

It facilitates development of multi-processor designs with large numbers of controllers and components with a bus architecture. Since its inception, the scope of AMBA has, despite its name, gone far beyond microcontroller devices. Today, AMBA is widely used on a range of ASIC and SoC parts including applications processors used in modern portable mobile devices like smartphones. AMBA is a registered trademark of ARM Ltd. AMBA was introduced by ARM in 1996. The first AMBA buses were the Advanced System Bus (ASB) and the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB). In its second version, AMBA 2 in 1999, ARM added AMBA High-performance Bus (AHB) that is a single clock-edge protocol. In 2003, ARM introduced the third generation, AMBA 3, including Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) to reach even higher performance interconnect and the Advanced Trace Bus (ATB) as part of the CoreSight on-chip debug and trace solution. In 2010 the AMBA 4 specifications were introduced starting with AMBA 4 AXI4, then in 2011 extending system-wide coherency with AMBA 4 AXI Coherency Extensions (ACE). In 2013 the AMBA 5 Coherent Hub Interface (CHI) specification was introduced, with a re-designed high-speed transport layer and features designed to reduce congestion. These protocols are today the de facto standard for embedded processor bus architectures because they are well documented and can be used without royalties.  Design principles  AMBA AXI handshake An important aspect of an SoC is not only which components or blocks it houses, but also how they interconnect. AMBA is a solution for the blocks to interface with each other. The objective of the AMBA specification is to: *facilitate right- first-time development of embedded microcontroller products with one or more CPUs, GPUs or signal processors, *be technology independent, to allow reuse of IP cores, peripheral and system macrocells across diverse IC processes, *encourage modular system design to improve processor independence, and the development of reusable peripheral and system IP libraries *minimize silicon infrastructure while supporting high performance and low power on-chip communication. AMBA protocol specifications The AMBA specification defines an on-chip communications standard for designing high-performance embedded microcontrollers. It is supported by ARM Limited with wide cross-industry participation. The AMBA 5 specification defines the following buses/interfaces: * AXI5, AXI5-Lite and ACE5 Protocol Specification * Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB5, AHB-Lite) * Coherent Hub Interface (CHI) * Distributed Translation Interface (DTI) * Generic Flash Bus (GFB) The AMBA 4 specification defines following buses/interfaces: *AXI Coherency Extensions (ACE) - widely used on the latest ARM Cortex-A processors including Cortex-A7 and Cortex-A15 *AXI Coherency Extensions Lite (ACE-Lite) *Advanced Extensible Interface 4 (AXI4) *Advanced Extensible Interface 4 Lite (AXI4-Lite) *Advanced Extensible Interface 4 Stream (AXI4-Stream v1.0) *Advanced Trace Bus (ATB v1.1) *Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB4 v2.0) *AMBA Low Power Interfaces (Q-Channel and P-Channel) AMBA 3 specification defines four buses/interfaces: *Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI3 or AXI v1.0) - widely used on ARM Cortex-A processors including Cortex-A9 *Advanced High-performance Bus Lite (AHB-Lite v1.0) *Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB3 v1.0) *Advanced Trace Bus (ATB v1.0) AMBA 2 specification defines three buses/interfaces: *Advanced High- performance Bus (AHB) - widely used on ARM7, ARM9 and ARM Cortex-M based designs *Advanced System Bus (ASB) *Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB2 or APB) AMBA specification (First version) defines two buses/interfaces: *Advanced System Bus (ASB) *Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) The timing aspects and the voltage levels on the bus are not dictated by the specifications. =AXI Coherency Extensions (ACE and ACE-Lite)= ACE, defined as part of the AMBA 4 specification, extends AXI with additional signalling introducing system wide coherency. This system coherency allows multiple processors to share memory and enables technology like ARM's big.LITTLE processing. The ACE-Lite protocol enables one-way aka IO coherency, for example a network interface that can read from the caches of a fully coherent ACE processor. =Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI)= AXI, the third generation of AMBA interface defined in the AMBA 3 specification, is targeted at high performance, high clock frequency system designs and includes features that make it suitable for high speed sub- micrometer interconnect: * separate address/control and data phases * support for unaligned data transfers using byte strobes * burst based transactions with only start address issued * issuing of multiple outstanding addresses with out of order responses * easy addition of register stages to provide timing closure. =Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)= AHB is a bus protocol introduced in Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture version 2 published by ARM Ltd company. In addition to previous release, it has the following features: * large bus-widths (64/128/256/512/1024 bit). A simple transaction on the AHB consists of an address phase and a subsequent data phase (without wait states: only two bus-cycles). Access to the target device is controlled through a MUX (non-tristate), thereby admitting bus-access to one bus-master at a time. AHB-Lite is a subset of AHB formally defined in the AMBA 3 standard. This subset simplifies the design for a bus with a single master. =Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)= APB is designed for low bandwidth control accesses, for example register interfaces on system peripherals. This bus has an address and data phase similar to AHB, but a much reduced, low complexity signal list (for example no bursts). Furthermore, It is an interface designed for a low frequency system with a low bit width (32bits). AMBA products A family of synthesizable intellectual property (IP) cores AMBA Products is licensable from ARM Limited that implement a digital bus in an SoC for the efficient moving and storing of data using the AMBA protocol specifications. The AMBA family includes AMBA Network Interconnect (CoreLink NIC-400), Cache Coherent Interconnect (CoreLink CCI-500), SDRAM memory controllers (CoreLink DMC-400), DMA controllers (CoreLink DMA-230, DMA-330), level 2 cache controllers (L2C-310), etc. A number of manufacturers utilize AMBA buses for non-ARM designs. As an example Infineon uses an AMBA bus for the ADM5120 SoC based on the MIPS architecture.

Initially called the Collision, the band was joined by Bob Lindsey on bass and Robby Cronholm (also formerly of Crumb) on vocals. After touring in 2002 with New End Original, which featured Far alum Jonah Matranga and Jeremy Tappero, Cronholm left the band and was replaced by Matranga. When Matranga joined, the band changed their name from the Collision to Gratitude. After picking up Matranga and changing their name, Gratitude signed to Atlantic Records. The group picked up Tappero as second guitarist before going into the studio. After Becker left the band in the middle of recording the record, drummer David Jarnstrom joined the band before the release of their self-titled debut album (Becker and other session musicians fulfilled the drum role during the recording of the album). Atlantic Records released Gratitude on March 8, 2005. The tracks \\"Drive Away\\" and \\"This Is the Part\\" were released as singles and received significant radio play both in the US and the UK. Gratitude's first tour for the album was in North America, supporting Jimmy Eat World (to whom the band has often been compared), and they were also on the bill for the 2005 Warped Tour and a leg of the 2005 Taste of Chaos. The band faced many difficulties after their album's release ‚Äî the commercial response was somewhat poor, and Weinberg left the band in June for personal reasons, thus forcing Gratitude to continue touring as a four-piece. Many show cancellations throughout the second half of 2005 and rumors of the band being dropped by Atlantic put the future of the band at stake. Eventually Gratitude released a statement on November 25, 2005 saying that they had in fact decided to split after playing one final show at the Ascot Room in Minneapolis two days earlier. The members of Gratitude have gone on to various other projects, with frontman Jonah Matranga continuing with his solo work. Members, Jeremy Tappero and David Jarnstrom returned to their other band, Minneapolis rockers, Attention. In March 2007, bassist Robert Lindsey joined them.

He was a commentator on the Hebrew Bible. He was one of two people now known as Rabbeinu Behaye, the other being philosopher Bahya ibn Paquda. He is considered by Jewish scholars to be one of the most distinguished of the biblical exegetes of Spain. He was a pupil of Rabbi Shlomo ibn Aderet (the Rashba). Unlike the latter, Bahya did not publish a Talmud commentary. In his biblical exegesis, Bahya took as his model Rabbi Moses ben Nahman (Nachmanides) or Ramban, the teacher of Rabbi Shlomo ibn Aderet, who was the first major commentator to make extensive use of the Kabbalah as a means of interpreting the Torah. He discharged with zeal the duties of a darshan (\\"preacher\\") in his native city of Zaragoza, sharing this position with several others. talmidim, \`Hokok in the Galil, Israel Torah commentary Among Bahya's principal works was his commentary on the Torah (the five books of Moses), in the preparation of which he thoroughly investigated the works of former biblical exegetes, using all the methods employed by them in his interpretations. He enumerates the following four methods, all of which in his opinion are indispensable to the exegete: # The peshat, the \\"plain\\" meaning of the text in its own right. # The midrash or the aggadic exegesis. # Logical analysis and philosophical exegesis. His aim is to demonstrate that philosophical truths are already embodied in the Bible, which as a work of God transcends all the wisdom of man. He therefore recognizes the results of philosophical thought only insofar as they do not conflict with Jewish tradition. # The method of the Kabbalah, termed by him \\"the path of light,\\" which the truth-seeking soul must travel. It is by means of this method, Bahya believes, that the deep mysteries hidden in the Bible may be revealed. Generally speaking, Rabbi Bahya does not reveal any of his Kabbalistic sources, other than generally referring to Sefer HaBahir and the works of Nachmanides. He only mentions the Zohar twice. Bahya's commentary is considered to derive a particular charm from its form. Each parashah, or weekly lesson, is prefaced by an introduction preparing the reader for the fundamental ideas to be discussed; and this introduction bears a motto in the form of some verse selected from the Book of Mishlei / Proverbs. Furthermore, by the questions that are frequently raised the reader is compelled to take part in the author's mental processes; the danger of monotony being also thereby removed. Printings The commentary was first printed at Naples in 1492; and the favor which it enjoyed is attested by the numerous supercommentaries published on it. Owing to the large space devoted to the Kabbalah, the work was particularly valuable to Kabbalists, although Rabbi Bahya also availed himself of non-Jewish sources. Later editions of the commentary appeared at Pesaro, 1507, 1514, and 1517; Constantinople, 1517; Rimini, 1524; Venice, 1544, 1546, 1559, 1566, and later. Not less than ten super-commentaries are enumerated by Bernstein (Monatsschrift xviii. 194-196), which give further evidence of the popularity of the work. Other works His next most famous work was his Kad ha-Kemah (The Flour-Jar) (Constantinople, 1515.) It consists of sixty chapters, alphabetically arranged, containing discourses and dissertations on the requirements of religion and morality, as well as Jewish ritual practices. Kad ha-Kemah is a work of Musar literature, the purpose of which is to promote a moral life. In it Bahye discusses the following subjects: belief and faith in God; the divine attributes and the nature of providence; the duty of loving God, and of walking before God in simplicity and humility of heart; the fear of God; Jewish prayer; benevolence, and the love of mankind; peace; the administration of justice, and the sacredness of the oath; the duty of respecting the property and honor of one's fellow man; the Jewish holidays, and halakha (loosely translated as \\"Jewish law\\".) Another work of Bahya, also published frequently, and in the first Mantua edition of 1514 erroneously ascribed to Nachmanides, bears the title of Shulkhan Arba (\\"Table [of] Four\\"). It consists of four chapters, the first three of which contain religious rules of conduct regarding the various meals, while the fourth chapter treats of the banquet of the righteous in the world to come. A work might have been written by Rabbi Bahye under the title of Hoshen ha-Mishpat (Breastplate of Judgment). Reference to this work is made only once by him, and it is unknown if this work was actually written or not. =Works incorrectly attributed to him= A number of works whose author is simply \\"Bahya\\", or whose authors are unknown, have been attributed to Rabbi Bahye ben Asher. Many modern day authorities on Rabbi Bahya's writings have shown that many of these attributions are spurious. *Ha-Emunah ve-ha-Bittahon (Korets, 1785) *Ma'arekhet ha-Elohut (Mantua, 1558) *Ma'amar ha-Sekhel (Cremona, 1557) One book ostensibly written by Bahya, edited by M. Homburg under the title of Soba Semakhot (\\"Fulness of Joy\\"), as being a commentary on the Book of Job, is actually a compilation made by a later editor from two of Bahye's actual works, Kad ha-Kemah (Constantinople, 1515) and Shulhan shel Arba (Mantua, 1514).

Hawes, with a number of Amiga-specific features beyond standard REXX facilities. Like most REXX implementations, ARexx is an interpreted language. Programs written for ARexx are called \\"scripts\\", or \\"macros\\"; several programs offer the ability to run ARexx scripts in their main interface as macros. ARexx can easily communicate with third-party software that implements an \\"ARexx port\\". Any Amiga application or script can define a set of commands and functions for ARexx to address, thus making the capabilities of the software available to the scripts written in ARexx. ARexx can direct commands and functions to several applications from the same script, thus offering the opportunity to mix and match functions from the different programs. For example, an ARexx script could extract data from a database, insert the data into a spreadsheet to perform calculations on it, then insert tables and charts based on the results into a word processor document. History ARexx was first created in 1987, developed for the Amiga by William S. Hawes. It is based on the REXX language described by Mike Cowlishaw in the book The REXX Language: A Practical Approach to Programming. ARexx was included by Commodore with AmigaOS 2.0 in 1990, and has been included with all subsequent AmigaOS releases. This later version of ARexx follows the official REXX language closely; Hawes was later involved in drafting the ANSI standard for REXX. ARexx is written in 68000 Assembly, and cannot therefore function at full speed with new PPC CPUs, a version of ARexx has not been rewritten for them and is still missing from MorphOS 3.0. William Hawes is no longer involved in development of Amiga programs and no other Amiga-related firm is financing new versions of ARexx. Notwithstanding this fact, the existing version of ARexx continues to be used, although it is not distributed with MorphOS. From the ARexx manual: > ARexx was developed on an Amiga 1000 computer with 512k bytes of > memory and two floppy disk drives. The language prototype was > developed in C using Lattice C, and the production version was written > in assembly-language using the Metacomco assembler. The documentation > was created using the TxEd editor, and was set in TeX using AmigaTeX. > This is a 100% Amiga product.ARexx Users Reference Manual Characteristics ARexx is a programming language that can communicate with other applications. Using ARexx, for example, one could request data from a database application and send it to a spreadsheet application. To support this facility, an application must be \\"ARexx compatible\\" by being able to receive commands from ARexx and execute them. A database program might have commands to search for, retrieve, and save data  the MicroFiche Filer database has an extensive ARexx command set. A text editor might have ARexx commands corresponding to its editing command set  the Textra editor supplied with JForth can be used to provide an integrated programming environment. The AmigaVision multimedia presentation program also has ARexx port built in and can control other programs using ARexx. ARexx can increase the power of a computer by combining the capabilities of various programs. Because of the popularity of a stand-alone ARexx package, Commodore included it with Release 2 of AmigaDOS. Like all REXX implementations, ARexx uses typeless data representation. Other programming languages made distinctions between integers, floating point numbers, strings, characters, vectors, etc. In contrast, REXX systems treat all data as strings of characters, making it simpler to write expressions and algorithms. As is often the case in dynamically scoped languages, variables are not declared before using them, they come into being on their first use. ARexx scripts benefit from an error handling system which monitors execution and responds accordingly. The programmer can choose to suspend and resume the execution of the program as needed. The ARexx command set is simple, but in addition to the commands there are the functions of its Amiga reference library (rexxsyslib.library). It is also easy to add other libraries or individual functions. ARexx scripts can also be invoked as functions from other ARexx scripts. Any Amiga program which has an ARexx port built in can share its functions with ARexx scripts. Examples of ARexx solutions to common problems =Implementing new features and capabilities via scripts= If end user is using a program which builds animations by joining various bitmap image files but which lacks image processing capabilities, he could write an ARexx script which performs these actions: #ARexx locates the image files in their directories #ARexx loads first image #ARexx loads paint program #The image is loaded into paint program which performs modifications to file #The modified image is stored into another directory #ARexx repeats procedure on any image in the directory #The paint program is closed and the animation program is loaded #The animation is built #The animation is saved in its directory #The animation program is closed =Avoiding repetitive procedures= EqFiles.rexx is a well-known example of a simple ARexx script written to automate repetitive and boring procedures. This script uses the ALeXcompare program to compare files, and then finds all duplicates in a set of files and returns output by highlighting any results in a different color. =Expand AmigaOS capabilities= One of the main features of ARexx is the fact it could expand the capabilities of the AmigaOS by adding some procedures the OS lacked. For example, a simple ARexx program could be written to print a warning message on the screen of the monitor, or play an audio alert signal if a certain Amiga program stops, faults or has finished its scheduled job. The following script is a minimal ARexx script that displays warnings depending on events that take place. /* Alarm.rexx */ ARG event IF event = 0 THEN EXIT IF event = 1 THEN SAY \\"Program has ended unexpectedly\\" IF event = 2 THEN SAY \\"Program has finished its job\\" IF event = 3 THEN SAY \\"Cannot find data in selected directory\\"  See also REXX  References  ;Notes   External links  Beginning ARexx Tutorial * Command and Function Reference * Design Tool Amiga APIs Amiga development software AmigaOS 4 software AmigaOS MorphOS Scripting languages CBM software Assembly language software Rexx (programming language) Inter-process communication ","title":"ARexx"},{"id":"1858510","text":"Wallisellen is a municipality in the district of B√ºlach in the canton of Z√ºrich in Switzerland, and belongs to the Glatt Valley (German: Glattal). History Aerial view by Walter Mittelholzer (1935) The first settlement at Wallisellen dates from 58 BC. The municipality Wallisellen has its origin between 400 and 700 BC, after the Germanic migration of the peoples. Wallisellen is named according to both parts \\"Walchen\\" and \\"Seller\\". The Germanic peoples described as \\"Walchen\\" its Celtic and Romanic neighbours (see Walensee, lake of the Walchen). The word \\"Seller\\" stands for immigrated farmers, in contrast to long-established farmers, who cultivated small and modest farms. Linguists think that the name originated because Franks or Alemanni gave the name \\"Wallisellen\\" to a small farmer settlement, which was inhabited or founded by Celts or Romans. With inauguration of the NOB-line Z√ºrich‚ÄìWallisellen‚ÄìWinterthur on 25 June 1856 Wallisellen had its first connection with the Swiss railway network. In 1916, the municipality of Rieden merged with Wallisellen. In the interwar period Wallisellen developed from a village to a growing suburb-municipality of Zurich, but didn't want to have a town charter. During the Second World War, Wallisellen participated actively in the \\"cultivation battle\\" (\\"Anbauschlacht\\", i.e. increase in domestic food production due to reductions in imports). In 1958 the Roman Catholic church of St. Antonius was built. Geography Protestant church of Wallisellen Wallisellen has an area of . Of this area, 23.8% is used for agricultural purposes, while 20.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 54.5% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (1.5%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains). Demographics Wallisellen has a population (as of ) of . , 25.5% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 11.8%. Most of the population () speaks German (83.2%), with Italian being second most common ( 3.8%) and Serbo-Croatian being third (1.9%). In the 2007 election the most popular party was the SVP which received 38.6% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SPS (19%), the FDP (15.4%) and the CSP (9.8%). The age distribution of the population () is children and teenagers (0‚Äì19 years old) making up 19.1% of the population, while adults (20‚Äì64 years old) make up 64.4% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 16.5%. In Wallisellen about 76.9% of the population (between age 25-64) have completed either non- mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Wallisellen has an unemployment rate of 3.21%. , there were 50 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 16 businesses involved in this sector. 3085 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 137 businesses in this sector. 8950 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 731 businesses in this sector.Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 30-July‚Äì2009  Economy  The large Shopping Center Glatt is an indoor shopping mall in the municipality, which opened in 1975.

In Wallisellen there are two scout troops: scout troop Gryfensee and scout troop Winkelried.  Language and rhyme  Wallisellen is known in the German part of Switzerland due to a rhyme: \\"Aazelle, B√∂lle schelle, d'Chatz gaht uf Walliselle, chunnt si wider hei, h√§t si chrummi Bei, piff paff puff und du bisch (ehr und redlich) duss\\". :German translation: \\"Anz√§hlen, Zwiebeln sch√§len, die Katze geht nach Wallisellen, kommt sie wieder nach Hause, hat sie krumme Beine, pfiff paff und du bist (ehr und redlich) draussen\\". :English translation: \\"Counting, peeling onions, the cat goes to Wallisellen, comes she back home, has she crooked legs, piff paff and you are (honestly and candidly) outside\\". A song of the Bernese dialect-band Stiller Has is \\"Walliselle\\". Today the native German-speaking population speaks a mixture of Swiss German dialects. A levelled Zurich-German with a tendency of integration of elements of German is widespread. Long-time residents recognise only in its pronunciation of the toponym Wallisellen with sharp \\"s\\".

(1271 ‚Äì 4 July 1336; Elisabet in Catalan, Isabel in Aragonese, Portuguese and Spanish), was queen consort of Portugal, a tertiary of the Franciscan Order and is venerated as a saint of the Catholic Church.  Family and early life  Born in 1271 into the royal house of Aragon, Elizabeth was the daughter of Infante Peter (later King Peter III) and his wife Constance of Sicily and the sister of three kings: Alfonso II and James II of Aragon and Frederick III of Sicily. Elizabeth showed an early enthusiasm for her faith. She said the full Divine Office daily, fasted and did other penance, as well as attended twice-daily choral Masses. Marriage King Denis of Portugal, the Rei Lavrador, and Queen Elizabeth of Portugal Queen Elizabeth, mounted on a mule, prevents a civil war in 1323, on the field of Alvalade Her marriage to King Denis of Portugal was arranged in 1281 when she was 10 years old, receiving the towns of √ìbidos, Abrantes and Porto de M√≥s as part of her dowry.Jo√£o Ferreira (2010), p.30 It was only in 1288 that the wedding was celebrated, when Denis was 26 years old, while Elizabeth was 17. Denis, a poet and statesman, was known as the Rei Lavrador (), because he planted a large pine forest near Leiria to prevent the soil degradation that threatened the region. Elizabeth quietly pursued the regular religious practices of her youth and was devoted to the poor and sick. Such a life was taken as a reproach to many around her and caused ill will in some quarters. Eventually, her prayer and patience succeeded in converting her husband, who had been leading what she considered a sinful life. Elizabeth took an active interest in Portuguese politics and was a decisive conciliator during the negotiations concerning the Treaty of Alca√±ices, signed by Denis and Fernando IV of Castile in 1297 (which fixed the borders between the two countries). In 1304, the Queen and Denis returned to Spain to arbitrate between Fernando IV of Castile and James II of Aragon, brother of Elizabeth. She had two children: *a daughter named Constance, who married King Ferdinand IV of Castile; *a son Afonso (who later became King Afonso IV of Portugal). Elizabeth would serve as intermediary between her husband and Afonso, during the Civil War between 1322 and 1324. The Infante greatly resented the king, whom he accused of favoring the king's illegitimate son, Afonso Sanches. Repulsed to Alenquer, which supported the Infante, Denis was prevented from killing his son through the intervention of the Queen. As legend holds, in 1323, Elizabeth, mounted on a mule, positioned herself between both opposing armies on the field of Alvalade in order to prevent the combat. Peace returned in 1324, once the illegitimate son was sent into exile, and the Infante swore loyalty to the king. Dowager Queen After Denis' death in 1325, Elizabeth retired to the monastery of the Poor Clare nuns, now known as the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha (which she had founded in 1314) in Coimbra. She joined the Third Order of St. Francis, devoting the rest of her life to the poor and sick in obscurity. During the great famine in 1293, she donated flour from her cellars to the starving in Coimbra. She was also known for being modest in her dress and humble in conversation, for providing lodging for pilgrims, distributing small gifts, paying the dowries of poor girls, and educating the children of poor nobles. She was a benefactor of various hospitals (Coimbra, Santar√©m and Leiria) and of religious projects (such as the Trinity Convent in Lisbon, chapels in Leiria and √ìbidos, and the cloister in Alcoba√ßa.Jo√£o Ferreira (2010), p.31 She was called to act once more as a peacemaker in 1336, when Afonso IV marched his troops against King Alfonso XI of Castile, to whom he had married his daughter Maria, and who had neglected and ill-treated her. In spite of age and weakness, the Queen-dowager insisted on hurrying to Estremoz, where the two kings' armies were drawn up. She again stopped the fighting and caused terms of peace to be arranged. But the exertion brought on her final illness. As soon as her mission was completed, she took to her bed with a fever from which she died on 4 July, in the castle of Estremoz. She earned the title of Peacemaker on account of her efficacy in solving disputes. Although Denis' tomb was located in Odivelas, Elizabeth was buried in the Convent of Santa Clara in Coimbra, in a magnificent Gothic sarcophagus. After frequent flooding by the Mondego River in the 17th century, the Poor Clares moved her mortal remains to the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Nova (also in Coimbra). Her body was transferred to the main chapel, where it was buried in a sarcophagus of silver and crystal. Sainthood Portrait by Jos√© Gil de Castro She was beatified in 1526 and canonized by Pope Urban VIII on 25 May 1625. Her feast was inserted in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 4 July. In the year 1694 Pope Innocent XII moved her feast to 8 July, so it would not conflict with the celebration of the Octave of Saints Peter and Paul, Apostles.\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 96 In 1955, Pope Pius XII abolished this octave.General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII The 1962 Roman Missal changed the rank of the feast from \\"Double\\" to \\"Third-Class Feast\\".3rd Class The 1969 revision of the Calendar classified the celebration as an optional memorial and restored it to 4 July. Her feast is also kept on the Franciscan Calendar of Saints. Since the establishment in 1819 of the Diocese of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna (Canary Islands, Spain), Saint Elizabeth is the co-patron of the diocese and of its cathedral pursuant to the papal bull issued by Pope Pius VII. In the United States her memorial has been transferred to 5 July since 4 July is the date of the independence of that nation, a national holiday. St. Elizabeth is usually depicted in royal garb with a dove or an olive branch.Foley, Leonard. \\"St. Elizabeth of Portugal\\", Saint of the Day, Franciscan Media Popular culture She was the subject of a 1947 Portuguese-Spanish film, The Holy Queen, in which she was played by Maruchi Fresno.

While in New York City he beat James Quigley and Jack Herd, drew with Karl Abs and William Muldoon, and lost twice to Abs. In June 1885 he wrestled in Cleveland and Scranton, Pennsylvania in December. On May 5, 1885 William Muldoon challenged Sorakichi to a handicap match, wagering $100 that he could pin the Japanese wrestler five times in one hour. Muldoon failed in his endeavor. During a February 15, 1886 match with Evan \\"Strangler\\" Lewis Sorakichi reportedly had his leg broken in a leg lock but was back in action one month later.

History The band formed after Steve Naghavi and Chris Ruiz met in 1989 at a Berlin club. Being fans of early EBM music, Naghavi and Ruiz decided to follow in the footsteps of new wave/synthpop band Depeche Mode by using two keyboards and a beatbox. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic called their 1990 single, \\"Metal Hammer\\", a \\"significant club hit\\". The duo became a trio with the addition of Alex Two, prior to the release of their debut album, Anguish in 1991. That same year, they were honored as the Best New Artist in western Germany. Going into the release of Anguish, they had already garnered a decent following through touring and appearances at various parties. With their debut release, they took home the Best New Artist award in Germany in 1991. Chris Ruiz left in 1992 (he would later return in 2001) while Steve Naghavi remained with the band.

Wirken (\\"Carl Abs, the wrestling Champion of the world: his life and work\\"). Personal life Carl Johann Theodor Abs was the son of Carl and Sophie Abs (n√©e J√ºrgens) in Gro√ü Godems, in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.Curchbook Entry. As the son of a Carpenter the younger Carl Abs learned his fathers craft and the intention was for his to succeed him in the business. Showing little interest in school Abs was more interested in farm work and through this discovered a keen interest in the environment. Later in his life his family moved to Hamburg.Notes by Carl Abs and his wife: Carl Abs: Der unbesiegte Meisterschaftsringer: Sein Leben und seine Thaten. (\\"Carl Abs: the Undefeated Championship wrestler: His Life and deeds:) 1895, Pages 1-2. In Hamburg he began working in a factory in Langenstein. In 1873 he did his military service with the 76th Infantry Regiment. At the time military service was a three-year ordeal, but through devotion to duty and punctuality Abs had his service time shortened by two years. Following his discharge he began working at a wine shop and later became a coach driver. When business turned bad Abs lost his job and returned to Gro√ü Godems, visiting his ill father before his father died. In 1877 he met Maria Augusta Katharina Warncke and married her later that year.Notes by Carl Abs and his wife: Carl Abs: Der unbesiegte Meisterschaftsringer: Sein Leben und seine Thaten. (\\"Carl Abs: the Undefeated Championship wrestler: His Life and deeds:) 1895, Pages 2-3. Professional wrestling career In 1880 Abs wrestled his first wrestling match, challenging \\"Iron Wilhem\\", the two wrestled to a draw in the first match and Abs won the rematch. Spurred by the fights Abs wanted to pursue a career in wrestling, which at the time was more of a side-show attraction than anything else. In 1881 he opened a gym in the basement of an art school. In 1882 he won a medal for his feats of strength. Due to his initial success he caught the attention of several German circus owners. Working with circus ringmaster Renz he toured German performing feats of strength as well as wrestle on occasion. After touring with the circus he returned to Hamburg where he wrestled against Mathias Sobien and Willy Henry. In 1885 worked for Circus Blumenthal, introducing the concept of professional wrestling to cities such as Karlsruhe.Notes by Carl Abs and his wife: Carl Abs: Der unbesiegte Meisterschaftsringer: Sein Leben und seine Thaten. (\\"Carl Abs: the Undefeated Championship wrestler: His Life and deeds:) 1895, Pages 3-5. With professional wrestling still being more of a side show than anything else Abs decided to tour the United States, hoping to learn from American promotions and wrestlers to improve the wrestling scene in Germany. In the United States he defeated the Japanese wrestler Sorakichi Matsuda as well as Edwin Bibby. He even defeated the high ranking William Muldoon in a match. Upon his return to Germany he resumed working in the circus performing strongman acts but also wrestled in several cities, turning back the challenge of Gustav Bachmann and Frenchman Piere Rigal twice.Notes by Carl Abs and his wife: Carl Abs: Der unbesiegte Meisterschaftsringer: Sein Leben und seine Thaten.

Working for Circus d'hiver Abs toured in France, where he was actually billed as being from Denmark to not have to face any German/French tension that had been building, but the deception only lasted for a short while before his true background was revealed. On July 25, 1891 Carl Abs defeated Tom Cannon to win the European Greco-Roman Heavyweight Championship, one of the earliest recognized championships in wrestling. After wrestling in Germany he traveled to Vienna, Austria working for Circus Schumann as well as wrestling against local champion Cheri Robinet. The first meeting between the two ended in a draw. Later he fought French wrestler Masson, in a match where the referee ruled it a draw. In January 1893 Abs fought and defeated Antonio Pierri in Altona, Hamburg, but Pierri contested the loss, claiming that he was not thrown by Abs but merely slipped. The controversial ending led to a rematch between the two, which Pierri won, leading to a third and deciding match between the two. The match was originally scheduled for February 9, but had to be postponed when Pierri suffered a dislocated shoulder. When the two finally met on March 9, 1893 Abs threw his opponent and won the match in only 16 minutes.Notes by Carl Abs and his wife: Carl Abs: Der unbesiegte Meisterschaftsringer: Sein Leben und seine Thaten.

Falgalas (born Heiko Duus) joined the band in 1993, first for live touring, later as full member. Chris L. (born Christian Lorenz) joined in 1998, so far only for live performances. As of January 2018, three band members (Wagner, Falgalas and Chris L.) have teamed up to start a new band called Darkness on Demand, maintaining the DoD acronym and musical style. History Their first mini album, Dance or Die, was the initial release of Berlin-based label Machinery Records. Its title track became one of the most frequently played titles in central and northern Europe. As summarized by Zillo, \\"in the 1990s [Dance or Die] formed the link between Gothic [rock] and Electro, and were a pioneer at that\\". They continued their collaboration with Jor until the label's demise. In 1997, they signed with Polydor but, after one album (Dehumanizer), that partnership ended - the dark electronic sound did not fit in with Polydor's dance-label What's Up?!. On Dehumanizer, the band was briefly joined by Norri as drummer. In 2001, they released the album Schlafende Energie on Synthetic Symphony in Germany. It was licensed to Energy Rekords in Sweden and Soyuz Music in Russia. After ten years, in 2011, they released their album Nostradamnation on Out of Line in Europe and Metropolis Records in North America. In December 2014, Wagner released an album with a new project named Ruhest√§tte Schwarz. Music In 2015, Dance or Die was still described as a \\"well-known Berlin cult Electro [band]\\" by the music magazine Sonic Seducer. Their music combines cold techno sounds with a deep voice (vocalist Gary Wagner even sings as guest on other artist's records, as on \\"Take Some More\\" by And One) and cyber-themed lyrics about life in the machine age. The albums were thus appropriately named, 3001 for the future, Psychoburbia taking psycho and burb together, while Dehumanizer seems to stand for itself. (Though it may have been named after Black Sabbath's Dehumanizer album, whose song \\"Black Sabbath\\" Dance or Die did cover on Psychoburbia.) Schlafende Energie (literally: sleeping energy) is a term coined by the German television series Raumpatrouille and means an energy reserve.

Historical background  right Louis-Napol√©on had previously made unsuccessful attempts to gain power, leading to his exile in London. His final attempt resulted in a coup d'√©tat on 2 December 1851. French guards opened fire on a group of protesters, causing several deaths. This did little to help achieve the reputation that Louis- Napol√©on had hoped for. In addition to this, he proceeded to change the constitutional laws governing the length of time that an emperor could rule. Hugo's sympathies lay with the working classes, and he was appalled by what he saw as a willingness to kill in order to gain power. Viewed as the voice of the masses in France, Hugo used his substantial influence to gather support against Louis-Napol√©on. His contempt was best illustrated in a speech delivered to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, where he declared, \\"Quoi? Apr√®s Augustus, nous avons Augustule!\\" This is a reference to the Roman emperor Augustus, and the suffix -ule derives from a Latin diminutive, indicating an object or person that is smaller in stature. This deliberately antagonistic declaration encapsulates Hugo's view: Louis-Napol√©on was far removed from the great military leader that his uncle, Napoleon Bonaparte, had been. In addition, Louis-Napol√©on's legitimacy was also brought into question. Rumours abounded (although none was ever proven) that he was an illegitimate child ‚Äî a product of one of his mother's numerous affairs ‚Äî and therefore could claim no right to his title. Hugo seizes on this in an attempt to discredit his position and title. His vociferous condemnation of Louis-Napol√©on as a traitor, usurper and dictator put Hugo and his family in danger . Realising this, Hugo fled his beloved France, vowing never to return until a new order was installed. After stopping in Brussels and then Jersey, Hugo settled with his family in Guernsey and remained there until 1870. Despite the distance from his readership, Hugo's influence remained strong and the years in exile produced a flurry of literary activity. Written in 1853, Les Ch√¢timents is arguably Hugo's most scathing work, including Les √âgouts (\\"The sewers\\"), which contrasts the lives of the poor whom Hugo claims Louis-Napol√©on ignored with the pompous grandeur to which the emperor aspired. Even the editor of the collection claimed that Hugo had gone too far with his vehement criticisms of the Second Empire. However, even if Hugo's comments did exaggerate the failings of Louis- Napol√©on's regime, they present a strong critique of a society bound by censorship of the press and the arts.  Literary techniques  Hugo resorts to extreme measures to portray Louis-Napol√©on as ruler with much blood on his hands, and Les Ch√¢timents is littered with references to corrupt and flawed historical figures. Some better known than others, they all gained notoriety for their corrupt and cruel natures. A device particularly favoured by Hugo is the comparison to Roman emperors, such as Caligula, Claudius and Julius Caesar. Allusions to the Bible include Judas Iscariot, Barabbas and Cain. Others include European leaders and French criminals who were well known in their days. Not satisfied with evil despots and tyrants, Hugo also turns to animalistic imagery as a means of implying that Louis-Napol√©on is less than human. References to snakes, crocodiles, worms, bees, wasps and spiders can be found. Hugo reserves the vous form of address for Napoleon Bonaparte. Along with being the polite form of address in French, it also denotes respect for someone in a higher position of power. The tu is used in a disparaging way for Louis-Napol√©on. It would be unthinkable that anybody should address the Emperor of the French in such a way. This form of address may denote familiarity between friends, but this is not Hugo's intention and it is used purely to belittle a futile leader. It is said that Napoleon III read the work thoroughly and kept a copy by his bedside. He is said to have been so devastated by Hugo's vicious condemnation that he never fully recovered from the shock of his first reading. There was even an attempt to reconcile with Hugo, with Louis-Napol√©on publicly extending an invitation for Hugo to return to France. One could equally argue that the failings of that same regime would indeed be difficult to exaggerate in terms of the time in which Hugo lived. This is very important to keep in mind: while Napoleon III, who was influenced by Saint-Simonianism, was no Hitler, and some of his policies are recognized as liberal, Hugo was a much-needed voice for continued social change in an impoverished, 19th-century France. L'Expiation, about the Battle of Waterloo, is parodied in Asterix in Belgium when Caesar fights a battle against the Belgians resembling the Battle of Waterloo. The actions on the battlefield are accompanied by verses which parody this poem.  Legacy  Les Ch√¢timents has never been out of print and is still studied in universities today. 1853 books Poetry by Victor Hugo ","title":"Les Ch√¢timents"},{"id":"1858595","text":"Static Icon is a synthpop band. They started in Adelaide, Australia as a three-piece band called \\"Das Concept\\". In their first incarnation they were a Depeche Mode cover band. Gradually they introduced more and more original material into their set. To complete the transition to a fully original band, they changed their name to Static Icon and dropped all but one or two Depeche Mode covers from their set. Through association with bands in the Melbourne, Australia industrial music scene they were introduced to and subsequently signed with EBM label Machinery Records in Berlin, Germany, with whom they released two albums, starting with Sin Machine in 1995. Their first album was recorded in Adelaide, but there was some issues around the master tapes being stolen. Shortly after they moved to Berlin, Germany where much of the album was re-recorded. Their second and best known album Slave was produced by Marc Heal and released in 1997. Static Icon toured the better part of 1997 with the \\"SLAVE TOUR\\" The breakdown of communication with the members and the record label resulted in the cancellation of the second leg of the European tour. The band need their own personal space for a while. Alan Wicks moved to London where he would start writing the third Static Icon album. Timo Bishop married his German girlfriend and moved back to Adelaide, Australia and Micheal Walker moved back to Melbourne, Australia. 1998 saw Alan Wicks moving back to Australia to finish writing the third Album. Melbourne and Sydney both played their role along with London in his demoing this album, which was written about his own experience as a wide-eyed person that moves to a mega city and how he sees that our conditionings as humans and our ideas of right and wrong and our man-made laws and beliefs don't work with this new era of the Mega city life style. The album was finally demoed at the end of 1998 and was ready for to go into the studio to be completed.

The film was written for the screen by Richard Levinson, William Link and by Lamont Johnson who was the director, the film stars Martin Sheen, and also features Charlie Sheen in his second film in a small role. Plot The book and the film tell the story of Private Eddie Slovik, the only American soldier to be executed for desertion since the American Civil War. The film starred Martin Sheen as Private Slovik, a performance for which he received an Emmy Award nomination for Best Lead Actor in a Drama. Sheen said he did not think actors should be compared, and made it clear he would refuse the award. Many critics and viewers consider this to be one of Sheen's finest performances. Among the other Emmy Award nominations, the film was named for \\"Outstanding Special\\". The film also won a Peabody Award. Development In 1960 Frank Sinatra announced that he would produce a film adaptation of The Execution of Private Slovik, with the screenplay to be written by Albert Maltz, who was one of the Hollywood 10 blacklisted after they refused to testify to the House Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC) in the McCarthy era. This announcement evoked tremendous outrage, with Sinatra accused of being a Communist sympathizer. As Sinatra was campaigning for John F. Kennedy for President, the Kennedy campaign became concerned and ultimately prevailed upon Sinatra to cancel the project.Scott Allen Nollen, The Cinema of Sinatra, pp. 214-216 In 1949, a Pentagon source revealed to Huie a European graveyard containing the remains of unidentified American soldiers. Huie's investigation identified Slovik's name and grave. Huie's account of Slovik is an example of his style of reporting and his tendency to anger Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had authorized the execution as commander of the Allied Forces, and who tried to stop publication of the book. Award-winning filmmaker Richard Dubelman acquired the film rights from Sinatra. Some years later, Dubelman persuaded Universal Studios to help him produce it as a television movie. Reception Television critic Matt Zoller Seitz in his 2016 book co-written with Alan Sepinwall titled TV (The Book) named The Execution of Private Slovik as the third greatest American TV-movie of all time, behind Duel (1971) and The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom (1993). Seitz praised Martin Sheen's performance as \\"one of his finest\\" and stated that the film is \\"as close to a perfect character study as network TV has produced, quietly outraged yet somehow resolutely unsentimental\\". Historical accuracy The military service record of Slovik, which is now a public archival record available from the Military Personnel Records Center, provides a detailed account of his actual execution. It was upon this that most of the film was based. The execution in the film, including the missed shots by the firing squad which led to Slovik dying slowly on the firing post over a course of five minutes, are accurate as compared to the actual execution. A slight dramatic license does occur in the final scene, as there is no evidence that the priest attending Slovik's execution shouted \\"give it another volley if you like it so much\\" after the doctor indicated Slovik was still alive.Archival service record of Eddie Slovik, National Personnel Records Center. In popular cultureThe 1963 World War II film The Victors includes a scene depicting the Christmas Eve execution of a GI deserter modeled after Slovik, accompanied by a Sinatra Christmas recording. *In Kurt Vonnegut's 1969 novel Slaughterhouse-Five, Billy Pilgrim finds an abandoned copy of Huie's book about Slovik and reads through it while in a waiting room. *The Canadian novel Execution and its adaptations tell a similar tale, based on the execution of Canadian soldier Harold Pringle for desertion in World War II.

It was once part of Saga Radio Group although it became independent in 2004. It operated as a sister station to Saga Digital radio. The line up featured a variety of presenters including David Hamilton, Don Durbridge, David Allan, Dave Cash, Gavin McCoy, Tony Myatt and Sheila Tracy (who had been the main proponent of big band music on BBC Radio 2). Music played on the station was easy and melodic from the past 6 decades. PrimeTime used jingles (\\"easily the best\\") that were reminiscent of those common in the mid-1960s (for example on the offshore Britain Radio). PrimeTime radio won Best Digital Terrestrial Station 2004 at the Sony Radio Awards ceremony. A further mark of its success was that, uniquely at the time for a commercial all-digital music station, its programmes were listed in full in the BBC's Radio Times. The Chairman of PrimeTime Radio, Roger De Haan announced in November 2005 that he was withdrawing PrimeTime Radio from DAB digital radio from May 2006 when its multiplex licence with Digital One ended. It continued on Sky channel 0132, NTL channel 871 and online at primetimeradio.org (and on DAB in Greater London and Northern Ireland) for a few weeks, carrying repeats of previous programming, before being withdrawn from these services on 2 June 2006.

Throughout Western Europe in the Middle Ages, humans hunted wild animals. While game was at times an important source of food, it was rarely the principal source of nutrition. Hunting was engaged by all classes, but by the High Middle Ages, the necessity of hunting was transformed into a stylized pastime of the aristocracy. More than a pastime, it was an important arena for social interaction, essential training for war, and a privilege and measurement of nobility. History Hieratic formalized recreational hunting has been taking place since Assyrian kings hunted lions from chariots in a demonstration of their royal nature. In Roman law, property included the right to hunt, a concept which continued under the Frankish Merovingian and Carolingian monarchs who considered the entire kingdom to be their property, but who also controlled enormous royal domains as hunting reserves (forests). The biography of the Merovingian noble Saint Hubert (died 727/728) recounts how hunting could become an obsession. Carolingian Charlemagne loved to hunt and did so up until his death at age seventy-two. With the breakup of the Carolingian Empire, local lords strove to maintain and monopolize the reserves and the taking of big game in forest reserves, and small game in warrens. They were most successful in England after the Norman Conquest, and in Gascony from the 12th century. These were large sanctuaries of woodlandthe royal forest where populations of game animals were kept and watched over by gamekeepers. Here the peasantry could not hunt, poaching being subject to severe punishment: the injustice of such \\"emparked\\" preserves was a common cause of complaint in populist vernacular literature. The lower classes mostly had to content themselves with snaring birds and smaller game outside of forest reserves and warrens. By the 16th century, areas of land reserved for breeding and hunting of game were of three kinds, according to their degree of enclosure and being subject to Forest Laws: Forests, large unenclosed areas of wilderness, Chases, which normally belonged to nobles, rather than the crown, and Parks, which were enclosed, and not subject to Forest Laws.OED Terminology One of the striking things about Medieval Hunting is its devotion to terminology. All aspects of the hunt - each different animal to be hunted, in each year of its development, each of its body parts, each stage of the chase, each feature of the hounds' behaviour - had its separate term. Knowledge and (partly whimsical) extension of this terminology became a courtly fashion in the 14th century in France and England. Medieval books of hunting lay huge stress on the importance of correct terminology, a tradition which was further extended to great lengths in the Renaissance period. The invention of the 'fair terms' of hunting was attributed by Malory and others to the Arthurian knight Sir Tristram, who is seen both as the model of the noble huntsman, and the originator of its ritual: > As he (Sir Tristram) grew in power and strength he laboured in hunting and > hawking - never a gentleman that we ever heard of did more. And as the book > says he devised good fanfares to blow for beasts of venery, and beasts of > the chase and all kinds of vermin, and all the terms we still have in > hawking and hunting. And therefore the book of venery, of hawking and > hunting, is called Sir Tristram's. Therefore all gentlemen who bear old > (coats of) arms ought to honour Sir Tristram for the goodly terms that > gentlemen have and use, and shall until Doomsday, that through them all men > of respect may distinguish a gentleman from a yeoman and a yeoman from a > villein. (Modernised)  How hunts were conducted  English and French accounts agree on the general makeup of a hunt‚Äîthey were well-planned so that everyone knew his role before going out. The hunt par force required each participant to have a specific role. If someone slipped in his role, not only could he easily get lost, but it put the rest of the group in danger by exposure. Many nobles hunted par force, for a multitude of reasons, but above all because it was considered the purest and noblest form of hunting. The ritual of the hunt was meant to heighten danger within a controlled context. Gaston, Duke of Orleans, argued against hunters taking game in more efficient ways such as by bow and arrow or by setting traps, saying, \\"I speak of this against my will, for I should only teach how to take beasts nobly and gently\\" (\\"mes de ce parle je mal voulentiers, quar je ne devroye enseigner a prendre les bestes si n'est par noblesce et gentillesce\\"). Hunters like Gaston hunted not to kill the largest game, but rather for the process of the hunt, preferring ritual over efficiency. This mode of hunting was also important in the upbringing of noble youths. Boys at the age of 7 or 8 years began to learn how to handle a horse, travel with a company in forests, and utilize a weapon, practicing these skills in hunting groups. As a result, young men in the nobility and royalty were able to transfer acquired skills such as horsemanship, weapons management, wood-crafting, terrain assessment, and strategy formation from the hunting grounds to the battlefield in wars. Hunting also cultivated their education, and taught them the importance of ritual and noble acts. Equipment Medieval women hunting, illustration from a period manuscript. The weapons used for hunting would mostly be the same as those used for war: bow, crossbow, lance or spear, knife and sword. Bows were the most commonly used weapon. Although the crossbow was introduced around the time of the First Crusade (1100), it was not generally used for hunting until the second half of the 15th century. Cudgels (clubs) were used for clubbing small game in particular by women who joined the hunt. \\"Boar spears\\" were also used. With the introduction of handheld firearms to hunting in the 16th century, traditional medieval hunting was transformed. The hunter would also need a horn for communication with the other hunters. In addition to this the hunter depended on the assistance of certain domesticated animals. Three animals in particular were essential tools for the medieval hunter: the horse, the hound and the hawk or falcon. =Horse= The horse was the most important animal of the great medieval household. The stables, also called the \\"marshalsea,\\" would be separate from the rest of the household, and its head officerthe marshal would be one of the household's senior officers. The marshal would have pages and grooms serving under him to care for the horses. A large household would have a wide array of horses for different purposes. There were cart- and packhorses employed in the day-to-day work of the household, palfreys used for human transport, and destriers, or warhorses, a powerful and expensive animal that in late medieval England could obtain prices of up to ¬£80. Although it had the necessary qualities, the destrier would not be used for hunting, due to its value. Instead, a special breed called a courser would be used. The courser, though inferior to the destrier and much smaller than today's horses, still had to be powerful enough to carry the rider at high speeds over large distances, agile, so it could maneuver difficult terrain without difficulty, and fearless enough not to be scared when encountering wild beasts. =Hound= Different breeds of medieval dogs The dog was essential for several purposes. Its good sense of smell made it invaluable in finding the quarry. It would then assist in driving the hunted animal and, when the animal was finally at bay, the dog would either be the instrument of attack, or distract the quarry while the hunter moved in for the kill. Different breeds would be used for different tasks, and for different sorts of game, and while some of these breeds are recognizable to us today, the dogs were nevertheless somewhat different from modern breeds. Foremost among the hunting breeds was the greyhound. This breed was valued first and foremost for its speed, but also for its ability to attack and take down the game. Since the greyhound did not have much stamina, it was essential that it be not released before the quarry was in sight, toward the end of the hunt. Furthermore, greyhounds, though aggressive hunters, were valued for their docile temper at home, and often allowed inside as pets. The alaunt, or alant, was a somewhat more robust animal than the greyhound, and therefore used against larger game, such as bears or boars. The alaunt was considered a reckless animal, and had been known to attack domestic animals, or even its owner. The mastiff was an even more rugged breed, and though also used on the larger game, was mostly considered useful as a guard-dog. What all these dogs lacked was the ability to follow the scent of the quarry, and run it down. For this purpose the running-hound was used. The running-hound was somewhat similar to today's foxhound. This dog had, as the name indicates, excellent stamina, as well as a good nose. Another dog valued for its scenting skills was the lymer, a forerunner of today's bloodhound. Handled on a long leash, the lymer would be used to find the lay of the game before the hunt even started, and it was therefore important that, in addition to having a good nose, it remained quiet. Silence in the lymer was achieved through a combination of breeding and training. Other dogs used for hunting were the kennet (a small hunting dog, from ONF 'kenet', a diminutive of 'chien'), the terrier, the harrier and the spaniel. The hounds were kept in a kennel, inside or separate from the main domicile. Here the dogs would have oak beds to sleep on, and often also a second level where the dogs could go when the ground level became too hot or too cold. Outside the kennel there would be grass for the dogs to eat whenever they had digestive problems. To care for the dogs would be a hierarchy of servants such as pages, varlets, aides and veneurs; the page being the lowest, often a young boy. Pages would often sleep in the kennels with the dogs, to keep them from fighting and care for them if they got sick. Though this might seem harsh by modern standards, the warm dog house could often be much more comfortable than the sleeping quarters of other medieval servants. =Hawks and Falcons= A portrait of Conradin hawking, from the Codex Manesse (Folio 7r). Medieval terminology spoke of hawks of the tower and hawks of the fist, which roughly corresponds to falcons and hawks, respectively. The female hawk was preferred, since it was both larger than the male and easier to train. A male saker falcon is approximately two thirds of the weight of a female; falconers call male peregrines tiercels, derived from the Latin word for \\"third\\". Hawks were captured all over Europe, but birds from Norway or Iceland were considered of particularly good quality. Falconry, a common activity in the Middle Ages, was the training of falcons and hawks for personal usage, which included hunting game. Falcons and hawks have different physical makeups which affects their mode of hunting. Ducks, herons, and cranes were the common game hunted by falcons and hawks. The main differences between the two species of birds lies in their wings and tails. Falcons have long, narrow wings with a long tapered tail. As a result, they fly at incredibly high levels. To kill game, they elevate high up in the sky and then dive at their target. Their dives can go up to 200 mph. They utilized their talons on the downward dive to slash game. Usually their strikes kill the game with the first slash. Hawks, however, have shorter, rounder wings and longer tails. They glide along at lower altitudes. To kill their game, they glide toward their target and then use a burst of speed to close in. They utilize their talons to dig in and clutch onto their game until it is dead. As a result of their makeups, falcons and hawks were utilized by owners for different terrains. Falcons were used in open fields while hawks were used in marshlands and woodland. Training a hawk was a painstaking process. It was normal at first to \\"seel\\" the bird's eyelids sew them shutso that it would not be scared or distracted. The trainer would then carry the hawk on his arm for several days, to get it accustomed to human presence. The eyes would gradually be unseeled, and the training would begin. The bird would be encouraged to fly from its perch to the falconer's hand over a gradually longer distance. Hunting game would be encouraged first by the use of meat, then a lure, and eventually live prey. Such prey included herons, sometime with their legs broken to facilitate the kill. Hawks would be housed in mews, a special edifice found in most large medieval households, mostly a certain distance from the main domicile, so that the hawks would not be disturbed. The mews could be rather elaborate structures. There would be windows in the wall, and the ground would be kept clean so that the bird's regurgitations could be found and analyzed. Among the species used were: *Hawks Goshawk Sparrowhawk *Falcons Gyrfalcon Hobby Lanner Merlin Peregrine Saker Of all the falcons, the gyrfalcon was considered the best one. They were thought of the highest quality when white ones were imported from Greenland. King Frederick II of England considered them the best \\"out of respect to their size, strength, audacity, and swiftness\\". Of the hawks, the goshawk was the most highly valued. They were more expensive and brought in more money for training. Goshawks from Scandinavia in particular were highly sought after. Quarry Most of the larger, wild mammals could be hunted. Different animals were valued for different qualities; both in the hunt itself, and in the meat and the fur they produced. =Hart= Deer hunting The king of all the wild animals was the deer, and more precisely the hart, which is an adult male of the red deer. The hart was classified by the number of tines, or points, on its antlers. An animal should have at least ten tines to be considered worthy of hunting; this was referred to as a \\"hart of ten.\\" Deer could be hunted in two different ways: par force (\\"by strength\\" and thereunder par force de chiens (\\"by force of dogs\\" )), and bow and stable. Hunting par force was considered the noblest form of hunting. In this process the game was run down and exhausted by the dogs before the kill was made. Par force hunting consisted of eight parts: the quest, the assembly, the relays, the moving or un-harboring, the chase, the baying, the unmaking and the cur√©e. *Quest: Before the hunt started, an expert huntsman, accompanied by a lymer, would seek out the quarry. By the help of tracks, broken branches and droppings he would try to locate the lay of the hart as accurately as possible; ideally he would see it. Picture from Livre de la Chasse showing relays of running hounds set on the path of the hart *Assembly: Then, early on the day of the hunt, the hunting party would meet, examine the huntsman's information and the deer's droppings, and agree on how best to conduct the hunt. This would be a social gathering also, with breakfast served. *Relays: When the path of the hart had been predicted, relays of dogs were positioned along it. This way, it was assured that the dogs were not worn out before the hart. *Moving: Also called the fynding. Here a lymer was used to track down the hart. *Chase: This was the hunt proper; here it was essential to keep the hounds on the track of the selected quarry. *Baying: When the hart could run no longer, it would turn and try to defend itself. It was said to be \\"at bay.\\" The hounds should now be kept from attacking, and the most prominent man in the hunting party would make the kill, with a sword or spear. *Unmaking: The deer was finally dissected in a careful, ritualistic manner. *Cur√©e: Lastly, the dogs had to be rewarded with pieces of the carcass, in a manner so that they would associate their effort with the reward. Hunting \\"by bow and stable\\" had less prestige, but could produce greater results. The quarry, often a whole herd, would be driven by hounds to a predetermined place. Here archers would be ready to kill the animals with bow and arrow. The subtlest form of hunting, and also the most productive relative to the forces used, was described by the German knight Guicennas. This was a party of two or three men on foot advancing slowly and quietly with partial concealment from horses (literal 'stalking horses' - because deer are relatively unalarmed by quadrupeds), so as to induce the deer to move without undue alarm into range of concealed archers. This required patience, a low profile attitude, and a deep appreciation of animal psychology. The hart was a highly respected animal, and had great symbolic and mythological significance. It was often compared to Christ for its suffering; a well-known story tells of how St. Eustace was converted to Christianity by seeing a crucifix between the antlers of a stag while hunting. A similar story is attributed to St. Hubert. Other stories told of how the hart could become several hundred years old, and how a bone in the middle of its heart prevented it from dying of fear. =Boar= Tr√®s Riches Heures Unlike the Romans for whom hunting boar was considered a simple pastime, the hunting of boars in Medieval Europe was mostly done by nobles for the purpose of honing martial skill. It was traditional for the noble to dismount his horse once the boar was cornered and to finish it with a dagger. To increase the challenge, some hunters would commence their sport at the mating season, when the animals were more aggressive. Records show that wild boar were abundant in medieval Europe; this is correlated by documents from noble families and the clergy demanding tribute from commoners in the form of boar carcasses or body parts. In 1015 for example, the Doge Ottone Orseolo demanded for himself and his successors the head and feet of every boar killed in his area of influence. The boar was a highly dangerous animal to hunt; it would fight ferociously when under attack, and could easily kill a dog, a horse, or a man. It was hunted par force, and when at bay, a hound like a mastiff could perhaps be foolhardy enough to attack it, but ideally it should be killed by a rider with a spear. The boar was sometimes considered a malicious animal, and even had satanic associations. It was also respected for its tenacity and appears frequently as a heraldic charge. =Wolf= Wolf hunt depicted in a 14th-century bestiarythumb200pxleft Wolves were mainly hunted for their skins, to protect livestock, and in some rare cases to protect humans. Pelts were the only considered practical use for wolves, and were usually made into cloaks or mittens, though not without hesitation, due to the wolf's foul odour. There were generally no restrictions or penalties in the civilian hunting of wolves, except in royal game reserves, under the reasoning that the temptation for an intruding commoner to shoot a deer there was too great. In 9th-century France, Charlemagne founded an elite corps of crown-funded officials called \\"Luparii\\", whose purpose was to control wolf populations in France during the Middle Ages. In England of 950, King Athelstan imposed an annual tribute of 300 wolf skins on Welsh king Hywel Dda, an imposition which was maintained until the Norman conquest of England. The Norman kings (reigning from 1066 to 1152 AD) employed servants as wolf hunters and many held lands granted on condition they fulfilled this duty. King Edward I, who reigned from 1272 to 1307, ordered the total extermination of all wolves in the counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire and Staffordshire, where wolves were more common than in the southern areas of England. James I of Scotland passed a law in 1427 requiring 3 wolf hunts a year between 25 April and 1 August, coinciding with the wolf's cubbing season. The wolf became extinct in England during the reign of Henry VII (1485‚Äì1509). Before its extinction in the British Isles, the wolf was considered by the English nobility as one of the five so called \\"Royal Beasts of the Chase\\". =Other quarry= Hunting of bears, especially on the Iberian Peninsula, was popular because of the animal's stamina and strength, and the danger of the hunt. Hunting the agile hare using greyhounds or hounds was a popular pastime; though opinions differed as to the edibility of the hare itself. Some animals were considered inedible, but still hunted for the sport. Foremost among these was the fox, well known for its cunning. Other inedibles were the otter and the badger. Curiously enough, medieval writings on hunting often carried detailed instructions on how to hunt a unicorn. Notoriously evasive, the unicorn could only be captured if enticed to fall asleep in the lap of a virgin.  Royal Forests  The royal forest was an area of land designated to the king for hunting and forestry; it included woodland, heathland, and agricultural land. As of the 12th century nearly a third of England's territory was assigned as royal forest. Only the king and other permitted members of the nobility were allowed to hunt game in the assigned area. To maintain this restriction, forest law was introduced to enforce the boundaries. Special officials known as foresters were in charge of overseeing forest law. The foresters were among the most hated of royal officials as they were often corrupt, having a reputation for making illegal side profits on royal forest property by farming, extracting natural resources, and poaching game. They exacted many punishments for poaching game, farming, and other illegal activities on the royal forest. Heavy fines and imprisonment were the common discipline. While foresters were in charge of the upkeep of forest law, sometimes the king would employ the local sheriff to get involved. Hunting, however, was not the only function for the royal forest. Kings would also use these territories for cattle upbringing, farming, and extracting the land's resources. They also notably served as reserves for all kinds of wildlife. King Henry I of England was known for having a fascination with pet animals. His parks included wild animals like lions and leopards. Forest laws in regards to hunting created class distinctions. King Richard II of England issued the first game law in 1390. It constituted a property requirement of certain value to have hunting dogs or other hunting equipment. = Poaching = Poaching was a common offense in the Middle Ages. It was an act that was engaged by all of society and was widely tolerated by it. All kinds of poachers engaged in this illegal act, but sometimes it was a highly organized activity. Poachers worked together in rings to accomplish their goals. They would poach game off royal forest property and sell it to commoners for a profit. Sometimes, these rings worked for other lords and even monks to supply them. The lords and monks in turn would either keep the game for their own consumption or sell it in the common marketplace for a profit. Game would not be the only item poached from royal forests. Many sought after its resources with wood in particular a highly sought commodity. Often the arresting of poachers did not end cleanly. Poachers would resist arrest, sometimes resorting to assaulting and shooting foresters to escape. There is a recorded instance of St Thomas Becket performing a miracle by healing a forester shot in the throat by poachers. Sometimes the nobility would engage in poaching by either taking more game than permitted or by hunting in a restricted area.  Art and symbolism  Like everything else in the Middle Ages, hunting was full of symbolism. Religious symbolism was common; the hart or the unicorn was often associated with Christ, but the hunt itself could equally be seen as the Christian's quest for truth and salvation. In the more secular literature, romances for instance, the hunter pursuing his quarry was often used as a symbol of the knight's struggle for his lady's favor. Hagiography, notably the lives of Saint Eustace, Saint Hubert and Saint Julian provided many opportunities for medieval artists to express hunting in illuminated manuscripts and stained glass. The \\"minor arts\\" such as wooden chests, tapestries and wall paintings also depict such scenes. In the 14th and 15th centuries the most detailed hunting images are found in illuminated manuscripts. Dangers of the hunt Hunting could be extremely dangerous and serious injuries and deaths among the hunters were not uncommon. Even kings and emperors were not immune to hunting accidents. Those killed while hunting include: *Emperor Basil I - died after an accident in which his belt was caught in the antlers of a deer *Emperor John II Komnenos - killed after accidentally pricking himself with poison arrows *Richard of Normandy - second son of William the Conqueror, mauled by a stag in the New Forest *King William II - Richard's brother, killed with an arrow in the New Forest three decades later. Widely suspected to be a murder, but is unproven. *King Fulk of Jerusalem - crushed under his horse after a fall while hunting *Valdemar the Young - co-ruler of Denmark, accidentally shot on a hunt *King Dagobert II - King of Austrasia, killed in a hunting 'accident', perhaps on the orders of the Mayor of the Palace, Pepin of Herstal. *King Aistulf - King of the Lombards, killed in a hunting accident near Pavia. Might have been murdered, although this is uncertain. Literature Hunting was a subject considered worthy of the attention of the greatest of men, and several prominent peers, kings and emperors wrote books on the topic.

The CMC is an important characteristic of a surfactant. Before reaching the CMC, the surface tension changes strongly with the concentration of the surfactant. After reaching the CMC, the surface tension remains relatively constant or changes with a lower slope. The value of the CMC for a given dispersant in a given medium depends on temperature, pressure, and (sometimes strongly) on the presence and concentration of other surface active substances and electrolytes. Micelles only form above critical micelle temperature. For example, the value of CMC for sodium dodecyl sulfate in water (without other additives or salts) at 25 ¬∞C, atmospheric pressure, is 8x10‚àí3 mol/L.Ana Dom√≠nguez, Aurora Fern√°ndez, Noem√≠ Gonz√°lez, Emilia Iglesias, and Luis Montenegro \\"Determination of Critical Micelle Concentration of Some Surfactants by Three Techniques\\", Journal of Chemical Education, Vol. 74 No. 10 October 1997, pp. 1227‚Äì1231 (pdf)  Description  Top to Bottom: Increasing concentration of surfactant in water first leads to the formation of a layer on the surface. After reaching the CMC micelles begin forming. Notice that the existence of micelles does not preclude the existence of individual surfactant molecules in solution. Upon introducing surfactants (or any surface active materials) into a system, they will initially partition into the interface, reducing the system free energy by: # lowering the energy of the interface (calculated as area times surface tension), and # removing the hydrophobic parts of the surfactant from contact with water. Subsequently, when the surface coverage by the surfactants increases, the surface free energy (surface tension) decreases and the surfactants start aggregating into micelles, thus again decreasing the system's free energy by decreasing the contact area of hydrophobic parts of the surfactant with water.Hakiki, F., Maharsi, D.A. and Marhaendrajana, T. (2016). Surfactant-Polymer Coreflood Simulation and Uncertainty Analysis Derived from Laboratory Study. Journal of Engineering and Technological Sciences. 47(6):706-724. doi: 10.5614/j.eng.technol.sci.2015.47.6.9 Upon reaching CMC, any further addition of surfactants will just increase the number of micelles (in the ideal case). There are several theoretical definitions of CMC. One well-known definition is that CMC is the total concentration of surfactants under the conditions:Phillips J. The energetics of micelle formation. Transactions of the Faraday Society 1955;51:561-9 :if C = CMC, (d3F/dCt3) = 0 :F = a[micelle] + b[monomer]: function of surfactant solution :Ct: total concentration :a, b: proportional constants The CMC generally depends on the method of measuring the samples, since a and b depend on the properties of the solution such as conductance and photochemical characteristics. When the degree of aggregation is monodisperse, then the CMC is not related to the method of measurement. On the other hand, when the degree of aggregation is polydisperse, then CMC is related to both the method of measurement and the dispersion. The common procedure to determine the CMC from experimental data is to look for the intersection of two straight lines traced through plots of the measured property versus the surfactant concentration. This visual data analysis method is highly subjective and can lead to very different CMC values depending on the type of representation, the quality of the data and the chosen interval around the CMC.Mukerjee, P.; Mysels, K. J. In Critical Micelle Concentrations of Aqueous Surfactant Systems; NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology: Washington D.C. USA, 1971; Vol. NSRDS-NBS 36 A preferred method is the fit of the experimental data with a model of the measured property. Fit functions for properties such as electrical conductivity, surface tension, NMR chemical shifts, absorption, self-diffusion coefficients, fluorescence intensity and mean translational diffusion coefficient of fluorescent dyes in surfactant solutions have been presented.Al-Soufi W, Pi√±eiro L, Novo M. A model for monomer and micellar concentrations in surfactant solutions: Application to conductivity, NMR, diffusion, and surface tension data.

The CMC is the concentration of surfactants in the bulk at which micelles start forming. The word bulk is important because surfactants partition between the bulk and interface and CMC is independent of interface and is therefore a characteristic of the surfactant molecule. In most situations, such as surface tension measurements or conductivity measurements, the amount of surfactant at the interface is negligible compared to that in the bulk and CMC can be approximated by the total concentration. There are important situations where interfacial areas are large and the amount of surfactant at the interface cannot be neglected. If, for example, air bubbles are introduced into a solution of a surfactant above CMC, these bubbles, as they rise to the surface, pull out the surfactants from the bulk to the top of the solution creating a foam column and thus reducing the concentration in bulk to below CMC. This is one of the easiest methods to remove surfactants from effluents (foam flotation). Thus in foams with sufficient interfacial area there will not be any micelles. Similar reasoning holds for emulsions. CMC is most typically measured by plotting surface tension versus surfactant concentration in an automated measurement. The other situation arises in detergents. One initially starts off with concentrations greater than CMC in water and on adding fabric with large interfacial area and waiting for equilibrium, the surfactant concentration goes below CMC and no micelles are left. Therefore, the solubilization plays a minor role in detergents. Removal of oily soil occurs by modification of the contact angles and release of oil in the form of emulsion. In petroleum industry, CMC is considered prior to injecting surfactant in reservoir regarding enhanced oil recovery (EOR) application. Below the CMC point, interfacial tension between oil and water phase is no longer effectively reduced.Hakiki, Farizal. A Critical Review of Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery Using Artificial Sandstone Core: A Mathematical Mode l. Paper IPA14-SE-119. Proceeding of The 38th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2014. If the concentration of the surfactant is kept a little above the CMC, the additional amount covers the dissolution with existing brine in the reservoir. It is desired that the surfactant will work at the lowest interfacial tension (IFT).  Simulations and Data sets  There is increasing interest in simulating micelles for industrial applications.William C, Jordan, Kirk E, Warren, Patrick B, Noro, Massimo G, Bray, David J, Anderson, Richard L, Toward a standard protocol for micelle simulation, The Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2016, Vishnyakov, Aleksey, Lee, Ming-Tsung, Neimark, Alexander V, Prediction of the critical micelle concentration of nonionic surfactants by dissipative particle dynamics simulations, The journal of physical chemistry letters 2013, The reliability of some experimental data has been questioned by some authors who have proposed standard data sets.Swope, William C, Johnston, Michael, Andrew, Duff, Andrew Ian, McDonagh, James L, Anderson, Richard L, Alva, Gabriela, Tek, Andy T, Maschino, Alexander P The Challenge to Reconcile Experimental Micellar Properties of the CnEm Nonionic Surfactant Family.

It is considered a sub discipline of hydrology, with an ecological focus. These interactions may take place within water bodies, such as rivers and lakes, or on land, in forests, deserts, and other terrestrial ecosystems. Areas of research in ecohydrology include transpiration and plant water use, adaption of organisms to their water environment, influence of vegetation and benthic plants on stream flow and function, and feedbacks between ecological processes and the hydrological cycle. Key concepts The hydrologic cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface on the earth. This flow is altered by ecosystems at numerous points. Transpiration from plants provides the majority of flow of water to the atmosphere. Water is influenced by vegetative cover as it flows over the land surface, while river channels can be shaped by the vegetation within them. Ecohydrology was developed under the International Hydrological Program of UNESCO. Ecohydrologists study both terrestrial and aquatic systems. In terrestrial ecosystems (such as forests, deserts, and savannas), the interactions among vegetation, the land surface, the vadose zone, and the groundwater are the main focus. In aquatic ecosystems (such as rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands), emphasis is placed on how water chemistry, geomorphology, and hydrology affect their structure and function. =Principles= The general assumptions of ecological hydrology is to decrease ecosystem degradation using concepts that integrate terrestrial and aquatic processes across scales. The principles of Ecohydrology are expressed in three sequential components: #Hydrological (Framework): The quantification of the hydrological cycle of a basin, should be a template for functional integration of hydrological and biological processes. This perspective includes issue of scale, water and temperature dynamics, and hierarchical interactions between biotic and abiotic factors. #Ecological (Target): The integrated processes at river basin scale can be steered in such a way as to enhance the basin‚Äôs carrying capacity and its ecosystem services. This component deals with aspects of ecosystem resilience and resistance. #Ecological Engineering (Method): The regulation of hydrological and ecological processes, based on an integrative system approach, is thus a new tool for Integrated Water Basin Management. This method integrates the hydrological framework and ecological targets to improve water quality and ecosystem services, using engineering methods such as levees, biomanipulation, reforestation, and other management strategies. Their expression as testable hypotheses (Zalewski et al., 1997) may be seen as: *H1: Hydrological processes generally regulate biota *H2: Biota can be shaped as a tool to regulate hydrological processes *H3: These two types of regulations (H1&H2;) can be integrated with hydro-technical infrastructure to achieve sustainable water and ecosystem services. The ecological hydrology in a specific system can be assessed by answering a few basic questions (Abbott et al., 2016). Where does the water come from and where does it go? This is defined as the flowpath taken by the water entering the watershed being assessed. How long does the water stay in a specific flux or pool of water? This is defined as residence time, in which the rate the water enters, exits, or is stored can be observed. What reactions and changes does the water undergo through those processes? This is defined as biogeochemical reactions, which have the potential to change the solutes, nutrients, or compounds in the water. Many methods are used to observe and test watersheds for the answers to these questions. Namely, hydrographs, environmental and injected tracers, or equations such as Darcy's Law. These three factors are interactive and interdependent. The connectivity of a watershed often defines how these traits will interact. As seasonal or event-scale flows occur, changes in connectivity of a watershed affect flowpath, residence time, and biogeochemical reactions. Places of high reaction activity in a specific place or time are called hot spots or hot moments (Pedroli, 1990)(Wand et al., 2015)(Krause et al., 2017)(Fisher et al., 2004)(Trauth et al., 2014)(Covino, 2016). =Vegetation and water stress= A fundamental concept in ecohydrology is that plant physiology is directly linked to water availability. Where there is ample water, as in rainforests, plant growth is more dependent on nutrient availability. However, in semi-arid areas, like African savannas, vegetation type and distribution relate directly to the amount of water that plants can extract from the soil. When insufficient soil water is available, a water-stressed condition occurs. Plants under water stress decrease both their transpiration and photosynthesis through a number of responses, including closing their stomata. This decrease in the canopy forest, canopy water flux and carbon dioxide flux can influence surrounding climate and weather. Insufficient soil moisture produces stress in plants, and water availability is one of the two most important factors (temperature being the other) that determine species distribution. High winds, low atmospheric relative humidity, low carbon dioxide, high temperature, and high irradiance all exacerbate soil moisture insufficiency. Soil moisture availability is also reduced at low soil temperature. One of the earliest responses to insufficient moisture supply is a reduction in turgor pressure; cell expansion and growth are immediately inhibited, and unsuberized shoots soon wilt. The concept of water deficit, as developed by Stocker in the 1920s,Stocker, O. 1928. Des Wasserhaushalt √§gyptischer W√ºsten- und Salzpflanzen. Bot. Abhandlungen (Jena) 13:200.Stocker, O. 1929b. Vizsg√°latok K√ºl√∂nb√∂z√∂ term√∂helyn n√∂tt Nov√©nyek v√≠shi√°ny√°nak nagys√°g√°r√≥l. √úber die H√≥he des Wasserdefizites bei Pflanzen verschiedener Standorte. Erd√©szeti Kis√©rletek (Sopron) 31:63-‚Äì76; 104-114. is a useful index of the balance in the plant between uptake and loss of water. Slight water deficits are normal and do not impair the functioning of the plant, while greater deficits disrupt normal plant processes. An increase in moisture stress in the rooting medium as small as 5 atmospheres affects growth, transpiration, and internal water balance in seedlings, much more so in Norway spruce than in birch, aspen, or Scots pine.Jarvis, P.G.; Jarvis, M.S. 1963. The water relations of tree seedlings. I. Growth and water use in relation to soil potential. II. Transpiration in relation to soil water potential. Physiol. Plantarum 16:215‚Äì235; 236‚Äì253. The decrease in net assimilation rate is greater in the spruce than in the other species, and, of those species, only the spruce shows no increase in water use efficiency as the soil becomes drier. The two conifers show larger differences in water potential between leaf and substrate than do the hardwoods. Transpiration rate decrease less in Norway spruce than in the other three species as soil water stress increases up to 5 atmospheres in controlled environments. In field conditions, Norway spruce needles lose three times as much water from the fully turgid state as do birch and aspen leaves, and twice as much as Scots pine, before apparent closure of stomata (although there is some difficulty in determining the exact point of closure). Assimilation may therefore continue longer in spruce than in pine when plant water stresses are high, though spruce will probably be the first to ‚Äúrun out of water‚Äù. =Soil moisture dynamics= Soil moisture is a general term describing the amount of water present in the vadose zone, or unsaturated portion of soil below ground. Since plants depend on this water to carry out critical biological processes, soil moisture is integral to the study of ecohydrology. Soil moisture is generally described as water content, \\\\theta, or saturation, S. These terms are related by porosity, n, through the equation \\\\theta = nS. The changes in soil moisture over time are known as soil moisture dynamics. Recent global studies using water stable isotopes show that not all soil moisture is equally available for groundwater recharge or for plant transpiration. =Temporal and spatial considerations= Ecohydrological theory also places importance on considerations of temporal (time) and spatial (space) relationships. Hydrology, in particular the timing of precipitation events, can be a critical factor in the way an ecosystem evolves over time. For instance, Mediterranean landscapes experience dry summers and wet winters. If the vegetation has a summer growing season, it often experiences water stress, even though the total precipitation throughout the year may be moderate. Ecosystems in these regions have typically evolved to support high water demand grasses in the winter, when water availability is high, and drought-adapted trees in the summer, when it is low. Ecohydrology also concerns itself with the hydrological factors behind the spatial distribution of plants. The optimal spacing and spatial organization of plants is at least partially determined by water availability. In ecosystems with low soil moisture, trees are typically located further apart than they would be in well-watered areas.  Basic equations and models  =Water balance at a point= A fundamental equation in ecohydrology is the water balance at a point in the landscape. A water balance states that the amount water entering the soil must be equal to the amount of water leaving the soil plus the change in the amount of water stored in the soil. The water balance has four main components: infiltration of precipitation into the soil, evapotranspiration, leakage of water into deeper portions of the soil not accessible to the plant, and runoff from the ground surface. It is described by the following equation: nZ_{r} \\\\frac{ds(t)}{dt}=R(t) - I(t) - Q[s(t),t]- E[s(t)] - L[s(t)] The terms on the left hand side of the equation describe the total amount of water contained in the rooting zone. This water, accessible to vegetation, has a volume equal to the porosity of the soil (n) multiplied by its saturation (s) and the depth of the plant's roots (Z_{r}). The differential equation ds(t)/dt describes how the soil saturation changes over time. The terms on the right hand side describe the rates of rainfall (R), interception (I), runoff (Q), evapotranspiration (E), and leakage (L). These are typically given in millimeters per day (mm/d). Runoff, evaporation, and leakage are all highly dependent on the soil saturation at a given time. In order to solve the equation, the rate of evapotranspiration as a function of soil moisture must be known. The model generally used to describe it states that above a certain saturation, evaporation will only be dependent on climate factors such as available sunlight. Once below this point, soil moisture imposes controls on evapotranspiration, and it decreases until the soil reaches the point where the vegetation can no longer extract any more water. This soil level is generally referred to as the \\"permanent wilting point\\". This term is confusing because many plant species do not actually \\"wilt\\". Damkohler Number The Damkohler number is a unitless ratio that predicts whether the time in which a particular nutrient or solute is in specific pool or flux of water will be sufficient time for a specific reaction to occur. Da = Where T is the time of either the transport or the reaction. Transport time can be substituted for T exposure to determine if a reaction can realistically occur depending on during how much of the transport time the reactant will be exposed to the correct conditions to react. A Damkohler number greater than 1 signifies that the reaction has time to react completely, whereas the opposite is true for a Damkohler number less than 1.

The top markets for Gordon's are (in descending order) the United Kingdom, the United States and Greece.Gin diageo.com It is owned by the British spirits company Diageo and, in the UK, is made at Cameron Bridge Distillery in Fife, Scotland (although flavourings may be added elsewhere). It is the world's best-selling London dry gin. Gordon's has been the UK's number one gin since the late 19th century. A 40% ABV version for the North American market is distilled in Canada. History The Cameron Bridge Distillery in Scotland where Gordon's is produced Gordon's London Dry Gin was developed by Alexander Gordon, a Londoner of Scots descent. <Website requires registration, 23 Apr 2015. He opened a distillery in the Southwark area in 1769, later moving in 1786 to Clerkenwell. The Special London Dry Gin he developed proved successful, and its recipe remains unchanged to this day. Its popularity with the Royal Navy saw bottles of the product distributed all over the world. In 1898 Gordon & Co. amalgamated with Charles Tanqueray & Co. to form Tanqueray Gordon & Co. All production moved to the Gordon's Goswell Road site. In 1899, Charles Gordon died, ending the family association with the business. In 1904 the distinctive square-faced, green bottle for the home market was introduced. In 1906 Gordon's Sloe Gin went into production. The earliest evidence in recipe books for the production of Gordon's Special Old Tom was in 1921. In 1922 Tanqueray Gordon & Co. was acquired by the Distillers Company. In 1924 Gordon's began production of a 'Ready-to-Serve' Shaker Cocktail range, each in an individual shaker bottle. In 1925 Gordon's was awarded its first Royal Warrant by King George V. In 1929 Gordon's released an orange gin followed by a lemon variety in 1931. In 1934 Gordon's opened its first distillery in the US, at Linden, New Jersey. By 1962 at least it was the world's highest selling gin. In 1984 British production was moved to Laindon in Essex. In 1998 production was moved to Fife in Scotland, where it remains to this day.Carbon Every label and bottle top of Gordon's gin bears a depiction of a wild boar. According to legend a member of Clan Gordon saved the King of Scotland from the animal while hunting. Products An export bottle of Gordon's London Dry Gin According to the manufacturer, Gordon's gin is triple-distilled and contains juniper berries, coriander seeds, angelica root, licorice, orris root, orange, and lemon peel, though the exact recipe has remained a closely guarded secret since 1769. It differed from others at the time in that it didn't add sugar, which made it a \\"dry\\" gin. It takes ten days' distillation after receiving the wheat to create a finished product of a bottle of Gordon's Gin. In the UK Gordon's is sold in a green glass bottle, but in export markets, it is sold in a clear bottle. Some airport duty-free shops sell it in plastic bottles in the 75cl size. Gordon's is sold in several different strengths depending on the market. In the US, the strength is 40% ABV. Until 1992, the ABV in the UK was 40%, but it was reduced to 37.5% to bring Gordon's gin into line with other white spirits such as white rum and vodka, and also reduce production costs (the other leading brands of gin in the UK, Beefeater gin and Bombay Sapphire, are both 40% ABV in the UK). In continental Europe and in some duty-free stores, a 47.3% ABV version (Traveller's Edition) is available in addition to the 37.5% one, while in New Zealand and Australia, as of 2011, it is sold at 37.2% ABV,The Original Gordon's London Dry Gin.

Batch code: A1018916:58. and in South Africa, it is 43% ABV. In addition to the main product line, Gordon's also produces a sloe gin; a vodka (US & Venezuela only), two alcopop variants, Space and Spark; three vodka liqueur variants, Cranberry, Parchita and Limon (Venezuela only) and a canned, pre-mixed gin and tonic as well as a canned Gordon's and Grapefruit (500ml - Russia only). On 11 February 2013, Gordon's announced the release of Gordon's Crisp Cucumber, a flavored gin, which blends the original gin with cucumber flavor. In early 2014, Gordon's Elderflower was added to their \\"flavored\\" gin collection, and is made in much the same way, with a natural elderflower flavoring being added to the original recipe. In August 2017, Gordon's began selling Gordons Pink, a pink-colored gin flavored with several types of red berries. In February 2020, Gordon‚Äôs launched two new flavours in lemon and peach.

With over 200 credits to his name, he had a highly prolific career in the American, British and Italian entertainment industries, supervising in and participating in the post-production dubbing both foreign and domestic, often overseeing the English-language dubbing of foreign actors' dialogue. He is known for his dubbing work in the James Bond series, Lawrence of Arabia, Once Upon a Time in America, and The Guns of Navarone.  Early life  Born in 1923, Rietti was the younger of two sons of the Italian actor Victor Rietti and Rachel Rosenay. In 1932, at the age of nine, he joined his father's company Teatro Italiano, making his stage debut in Mysterious Currents. His father (under whom Ida Lupino and June Duprez had studied acting) developed his son's acting career under the name Bobby Rietti. He made his motion picture debut as Fattorino in Monty Banks' comedy Heads We Go (1933). He soon caught the eye of David O. Selznick, who offered him an extended film contract. Despite letting down Alfred Hitchcock, who handpicked him to play the lead in Sabotage (1936), he made 17 motion pictures during the 1930s, remaining a popular child actor throughout that decade. They would later work together in Hitchcock's film Frenzy. Rietti was also active on the stage. At the age of twelve he played Jonathan across Elisabeth Bergner in James Barrie's last play, The Boy David (1936), which dramatised the Biblical story of King Saul and the young David. Altogether, in his boyhood years he acted in eighteen films and over one hundred and twenty plays. =Second World War= His successful career on the stage and in motion pictures was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War. Rietti and his brother, being Italian, were interned at Ascot internment camp. He later joined the Rifle Brigade, but accepted the army's request for him to head \\"Stars in Battledress\\", a group of young actors, which included the young Peter Ustinov and Terry-Thomas, who toured England, and were flown throughout liberated Europe, to entertain Allied troops. In 1945, he was invited by John Gielgud to join his production of Hamlet for troops in the Far East. After the war, he returned to work in the theatre, films, radio, and the latest medium, early television. Career =Radio= In radio, he teamed up with Orson Welles in the radio series The Third Man (1951), and then again on the popular series The Black Museum (1952), which was broadcast to the US Armed Forces. This was to be the beginning of many collaborations between Rietti and Orson Welles, who remained close friends. He was also a regular on the radio series Horatio Hornblower (1952) with Michael Redgrave, The Scarlet Pimpernel (1952), Theatre Royal (1954) with Sir Laurence Olivier, and the classic Sherlock Holmes (1954) with John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson. =Television= His frequent work in television and many guest appearances made him a familiar face in the 1950s and 1960s. He is credited with 164 television appearances. He guest starred together with his father in The Jack Benny Program (1957) and in Harry's Girls (1960), which were both directed by his friend Ralph Levy, director of The Burns and Allen Show. They also performed together in three versions of his father's television success To Live in Peace and his father's television play Against the Stream (1959). In 1958, George Sanders presented Candle for the Madonna, an original television play Robert had written, in which Robert also played the lead. Rietti (center) accepting the Honorary Doctorate of the Arts at the University of Florida in 2012 =Films= Among the earliest of his film appearances were with Leslie Howard in The Scarlet Pimpernel and with Douglas Fairbanks in The Private Life of Don Juan (both 1934). Of his 83 film appearances throughout his career, he is best remembered for contribution to the original James Bond pictures: besides Sean Connery, he was the only actor who appeared in both Thunderball (1965) and the re-make Never Say Never Again (1983). Other popular films he appeared in include The Italian Job (1969), Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971), The Omen (1976), as well as a cameo in Hannibal (2001). He played Robert Grant in Hell is Empty (1967) for his brother, the producer Ronald Rietti. = Directing ADR = With the growing popularity of epic international films in the 1950s, Rietti gained a reputation for directing the ADR in many international films like Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and the James Bond films. Rietti Directed ADR in more than 700 Films and received international recognition as the foremost Director in this field. He was nominated in Hollywood for the Golden Reel Award (a technical Oscar) for his ADR direction of the English version of Once Upon a Time in America (1984), in which he directed Robert De Niro's post syncing. He often cast a young Catherine Zeta Jones as a re-voicing artist. Impressed with her talent, he pushed Samuel Goldwyn Jr. to cast her at a time when the actress was unknown. His own voice was used to re-voice Gregory Peck's German dialogue in Guns of Navarone (1961); and Orson Welles' in Treasure Island (1972). His voice was used in eight of the James Bond films, for which he directed the ADR; his best known work in the series was replacing the voice of Adolfo Celi in Thunderball (1965) and Tetsur≈ç Tamba in You Only Live Twice (1967). In the last ten films of Jack Hawkins, who had lost his voice to throat cancer, Hawkins was dubbed by Rietti. =Playwright= Rietti was also a prolific playwright who translated and adapted many Italian plays (notably those of Luigi Pirandello), from his native Italian into English. He also wrote several original plays which were produced on the stage, for television, and for radio. He founded and served as executive editor for 18 years of Gambit, a theatre quarterly which published international plays, including many of his own. In recognition of their contribution to the arts, he was knighted together with his father, Victor Rietti, by the Italian government in 1959. Rietti's title Cavaliere was upgraded in 1988 to Cavaliere Ufficiale. In 1957, Rietti played Satan in the York Mystery Plays; one of these performances was attended by the Queen.  Later life and death  In 2012, he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Florida for his lifetime achievements and contribution to the Arts.

It has been traditionally used as the office of the Chief Whip although the upper floor forms part of the residential apartment for the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It has been owned and used by the Crown since 1803, first housing the Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces and then the Colonial Office, before the office of the Chief Whip moved into the premises in 1879 until 2001. It is a Grade II listed building. Current use The offices of the Prime Minister in 10 Downing Street have spread into 12 Downing Street, connected by a corridor which runs through 11 Downing Street. Under the current government the building is being used to house the Prime Minister's Press Office and Strategic Communications Unit.Franklin (2005): p. 304 Although historically the house was used as the office of the Chief Whip, that is now located in 9 Downing Street. The upper floor of 12 Downing Street forms part of the Prime Minister's personal apartment. This stretches from No. 12 across to No. 10 as a joint apartment. Historical use Downing Street looking west. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is on the left. The three adjoining houses 9-11 Downing St. are of dark brick, 11 having a white stucco ground floor. 12 Downing Street is the later-built red-brick building projecting forward from the line of the other three. The building on the near right is the Barry wing of the Cabinet Office, which has its main frontage on Whitehall. The land on which 12 Downing Street is built was first sold by Charles Downing to James Steadman in 1723. The house was then sold in 1772 to William Maseres, who leased it three years later to Henry Hunt. This lease was bought out by Simon Frazer, who also acquired Maseres' stake in the property. After Frazer's death in 1783, it was sold by the executors to James Martin, who in turn sold it to the East India Company in 1803. It was purchased that year by the Crown, and was first used to house the Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces. In 1827, it was taken over by the Colonial Office. When Downing Street was remodelled in 1846, the houses at 10, 11 and 12 were joined together as a single overall building, No. 12 continuing to accommodate the Colonial Office. After that moved out in 1879, the house at 12 Downing Street was for many decades used as the office of the Chief Whip of the Government, and also for parliamentary dinners. Herbert Gladstone, the son of then- Chancellor of the Exchequer William Ewart Gladstone, was born at 12 Downing Street in 1854. Herbert later became Home Secretary and the first Governor- General of the Union of South Africa. During the First World War the premises were the headquarters of the Parliamentary Recruitment Committee. It was formed across parties, and managed by the three Chief Whips during the Asquith coalition ministry of 1915‚Äì16.Oakes (2009): p. 87 Following the breakup of the coalition government, the Liberal Party Chief Whip John Gulland was blamed in some parts of the media for disconnecting the phone line running to 12 Downing Street. This was denied, and a statement was issued to say that \\"At no time was the telephone temporarily disconnected.\\" The building became Grade II listed on 14 January 1970. The residency of the Chief Whips at 12 Downing Street ended in 2001, when Press Secretary Alastair Campbell was moved there from an office in 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister Tony Blair. The Whips were moved to 9 Downing Street, previously only known as the Privy Council building. During Gordon Brown's period as Prime Minister, he moved the Press Office back out of 12 Downing Street and instead used it as an open-plan office for himself and his key advisers, because it contained an individual space large enough for him and his advisers‚Äîsomething not available in 10 Downing Street.

She took the name of Andr√© L√©o, her two twin sons' names. She was born in Lusignan, Vienne, at Town Hall square, in 1824. She stayed there until 1830, when her father moved to Champagn√© Saint Hilaire, where he was a judge. She left the region in 1851, to Lausanne in Switzerland, where she married Gregoire Champseix. He was there since the Spring 1849 after fleeing the repression due to his contribution to the 1848 revolution and later, the Napoleon III police. In 1866 a feminist group called the Soci√©t√© pour la Revendication du Droit des Femmes began to meet at the house of Andr√© L√©o in Paris. Members included Paule Minck, Louise Michel, Eliska Vincent, √âlie Reclus and his wife No√©mie, Mme Jules Simon and Caroline de Barrau. Maria Deraismes also participated. Because of the broad range of opinions, the group decided to focus on the subject of improving girls' education. Andr√© L√©o fought with the French Republicans, later during the Commune de Paris, and in the International Workers Association. Travelling in Europe, she studied and worked at improving the feminine condition of her times. She died in Paris in 1900, after achieving much work: numerous novels, tales and essays, articles and political texts. Her writings, especially on social and educational issues, express ideas which still remain highly topical.

The Romans were renowned for its use, as at the Limyra Bridge in Turkey. Until the turn of the 20th century almost all falsework was constructed from timber. To compensate for timber shortages in different regions and to rationalize labor and material usage, new systems were developed.Burrows B.G (198X) Thesis. (University of Warwick) The major developments include the design of connection devices (coupler), transitions to other spanning beams such as steel pipes or profiles or reusable timber beams, and adjustable steel props. In 1935 W.A. de Vigier designed an adjustable steel prop which revolutionized many aspects of the construction industry including to support slab formwork, wall formwork, trench sheeting and falsework. Materials from which falsework systems are manufactured have also diversified from traditional steel and timber to aluminium components. Monroe Street Bridge, Spokane, Washington, 1911 In the UK, BS 5975 gives recommendations for the design and use of falsework on construction sites. It was first introduced by the British Standards Institute in March 1982 and the third version was published in 2008 with Amendment 1 in 2011.

In bridge construction Falsework parallel truss bridges temporarily supporting deck segment box structures A certain type of bridge, the self-anchored suspension bridge, must be supported during construction, either by the use of cantilever or suspension methods or by support from below. Support from below was used in the construction of the main span of the eastern span replacement of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, using parallel prefabricated truss spans.

To avoid confusion with the 1931 Marx Brothers film of the same name, this film is sometimes referred to as Howard Hawks' Monkey Business. Plot Ginger Rogers, Robert Cornthwaite, Cary Grant, and Marilyn Monroe in Monkey Business Dr. Barnaby Fulton (Cary Grant), an absent- minded research chemist for the Oxly chemical company, is trying to develop an elixir of youth. He is urged on by his commercially minded boss, Oliver Oxly (Charles Coburn). One of Dr. Fulton's chimpanzees, Esther, gets loose in the laboratory, mixes a beaker of chemicals, and pours the mix into the water cooler. The chemicals have the rejuvenating effect Fulton is seeking. Unaware of Esther's antics, Fulton tests his latest experimental concoction on himself and washes it down with water from the cooler. He soon begins to act like a 20-year-old and spends the day out on the town with his boss's secretary, Lois Laurel (Marilyn Monroe). When Fulton's wife, Edwina (Ginger Rogers), learns that the elixir \\"works\\", she drinks some along with water from the cooler and turns into a prank-pulling schoolgirl. Edwina makes an impetuous phone call to her old flame, the family lawyer, Hank Entwhistle (Hugh Marlowe). Her mother, who knows nothing of the elixir, believes that Edwina is truly unhappy in her marriage and wants a divorce. Barnaby takes more elixir and befriends a group of kids playing as make-believe \\"Indians\\" (Native Americans). They capture and \\"scalp\\" Hank (giving him a Mohawk hairstyle), later fleeing when police show up. Meanwhile, Edwina lies down to sleep off the formula. Meanwhile, a woman leaves her baby with the Fultons' housekeeper as she needs an emergency babysitter. When Edwina awakens, a naked baby is next to her and Barnaby's clothes are nearby. She mistakenly presumes he has taken too much formula and regressed to a baby. She takes the child to Oxly to resolve the problem. Together the two attempt to find an antidote and when the baby grows sleepy, Edwina tries to put him to sleep in the hopes of reversing the effects. Meanwhile, more and more scientists (and Mr Oxly) at the laboratory are drinking the water and reverting to a second childhood. The formula is lost with the last of the water poured away. As the water is poured away, Barnaby crawls into the laboratory through the window and lays down to sleep next to the baby. Edwina later discovers him and realizes her mistake with the baby. Later at home as Barnaby and Edwina are planning to go out, their spirits and marriage renewed, Barnaby notes that \\"you're old only when you forget you're young.\\" Cast Cary Grant as Dr. Barnaby Fulton * Ginger Rogers as Edwina Fulton * Marilyn Monroe as Lois Laurel * Charles Coburn as Oliver Oxley * Hugh Marlowe as Hank Entwhistle * Henri Letondal as Dr. Jerome Kitzel * Robert Cornthwaite as Dr. Zoldeck * Larry Keating as G.J.

Hawks said he did not think the film's premise was believable, and as a result thought the film was not as funny as it could have been. Peter Bogdanovich has noted that the scenes with Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe work especially well and laments that Monroe was not the leading lady instead of Ginger Rogers. However, Gregory Lamb of The Christian Science Monitor described Rogers as \\"a comedienne par excellence\\" in the film.The Christian Science Monitor, November 4, 2011: Celebrating the Ginger Rogers century In the book Film Dialogue Jeff Jaeckle criticized the film's depictions of Native Americans during a scene of Grant playing cowboys and Indians, stating that \\"Smearing war paint on his face and adopting the name of Red Eagle, he coaches the children in a war song: 'We wantum wampum, we wantum wampum/Ugha ugha goo goo', and so on. In such nonsense speech Indianness and childishness are the same thing. It seems worth making a distinction between this and the evident good intentions of such liberal films as Broken Arrow.\\" References External links   *Historic reviews, photo gallery at CaryGrant.net 1952 films 20th Century Fox films American science fiction comedy films American screwball comedy films American films American black-and-white films English-language films Films directed by Howard Hawks Films with screenplays by Ben Hecht Films with screenplays by Charles Lederer Films with screenplays by I.

Huie was a prolific writer, investigative reporter, editor, national lecturer, television host, and masterful storyteller. His credits include twenty-one books that sold over 30 million copies worldwide. In addition to writing 14 bestsellers, he wrote hundreds of articles that appeared in all of the major magazines and newspapers of the day. Huie wrote several books about controversial topics related to World War II and the Civil Rights Movement. He was also known for the practice of checkbook journalism, paying subjects to gain interviews and articles about them. In January 1956 he published an interview in Look magazine in which the two white men who killed Emmett Till admitted their guilt and described their crime. They had been acquitted at trial several months previously by an all-white jury. Six of Huie's books were adapted as feature films during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  Early life and career  Born in Hartselle, Alabama in 1910, William Bradford Huie was the son of John Bradford and Margaret Lois (Brindley) Huie, and was the eldest of three children. He attended Morgan County High School and graduated as class valedictorian. He attended the University of Alabama, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1930. From 1932 to 1936, Huie worked as a journalist for the Birmingham Post newspaper. In 1934, he married his grammar school sweetheart, Ruth Puckett. Their wedding took place in her parents' home in Hartselle. Huie later described the scene in his largely autobiographical first novel, Mud on the Stars (1942). In late 1938, Huie was in Los Angeles and worked independently as an undercover reporter to gather information on gangster Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel. He reported on his experiences in the Los Angeles Times and later in the December 1950 issue of The American Mercury, a literary magazine. Recognition as journalist Huie's first national recognition came from his article \\"How To Keep Football Stars In College\\", Collier's Weekly, 1 January 1941. This piece about the University of Alabama 1940s football program included provocative quotes, such as \\"We who have recruited Alabama's players know who our competitors have been. And we've offered no higher prices than were necessary to compete in the open market.\\"William B. Huie, \\"How To Keep Football Stars In College,\\" Collier's Weekly, 1 January 1941 World War II During World War II, Huie served in the United States Navy as a lieutenant and a war correspondent from 1943 to 1945, including a period as aide to Vice Admiral Ben Moreell of the Seabees. While chronicling the wartime activity of the Seabees, Lieutenant Huie had special permission to continue his own writing projects, both fiction and nonfiction. He drew from his Navy experiences, including his participation in D-Day, for his 1959 novel The Americanization of Emily. It was adapted as the 1964 film of the same name starring James Garner and Julie Andrews. Both Garner and AndrewsBlank, Ed. \\"Andrews as Maria a result of 'happy circumstances'\\". Pittsburgh Tribune- Review. 17 November 2005. consider it the personal favorite of their films.James Garner of Charlie Rose, ~6' from beginning Discharged in 1945 from the Navy, Huie went immediately to the Pacific theatre as a war correspondent. His experiences at Iwo Jima became the basis for the nonfiction work, \\"The Hero of Iwo Jima\\", published in The Hero of Iwo Jima and Other Stories in 1962. It was an account of the life of flag-raiser Ira Hayes. Huie's account was developed into the 1961 film The Outsider, starring Tony Curtis. He drew from his experiences in Hawaii during the war for his novel The Revolt of Mamie Stover (1951). This was adapted as the 1956 film of the same name starring Jane Russell. He was on every war front except Russia during WWII. The American Mercury Before the war, Huie had been writing for The American Mercury, a literary magazine founded by H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan. Like Mencken, Huie was a critic of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's \\"New Deal\\" policies during the Great Depression. After the war, he returned to the Mercury, becoming associate editor, then editor. In 1950, publisher Clendenin J. Ryan bought the magazine. Ryan and editor Huie wanted to develop the magazine as a journal of the fledgling American conservative movement, introducing new, mass-appeal writers such as evangelist Billy Graham, former communist Max Eastman, and long-time Federal Bureau of Investigation director J. Edgar Hoover. Young William F. Buckley, future National Review founder and editor, was one of Huie's early staffers. By the mid-1950s, however, Huie and Ryan were unable to overcome financial difficulties and were forced to sell the magazine to one of its investors, Russell Maguire. After Huie's departure, Maguire and other owners drove the new American Mercury, in author William A. Rusher's phrase, \\"toward the fever swamps of anti-Semitism.\\" He believed that they destroyed its legitimacy and contributed to its end. To Huie's disgust, the journal that had once featured the work of W. E. B. Du Bois and Langston Hughes became a periodical advocating racism. Freelance work (1950s to 1960s) From 1950 to 1955, Huie was a popular speaker, traveling back and forth across the country on the professional lecture circuit. During the same period, he also became well known through his appearances on the weekly television current events program, Longines Chronoscope, produced in New York City. As a co-editor of the hour-long talk show, he interviewed newsmakers John F. Kennedy, Joseph McCarthy, and Clare Boothe Luce, as well as international figures, politicians, scientists, and economists. His program co-editors included figures such as Henry Hazlitt and Max Eastman. Domestic issues, Congressional activity, military defense, the Olympics, and foreign policy were all topics discussed on the program.Longines Chronoscope programs are at the Library of Congress National Archives and Records (https://www.archives.gov) catalogued as \\"Television Interviews, 1951-1955\\". In the late 1950s, Huie and his wife resettled permanently in their native Hartselle. Ruth worked as a first grade schoolteacher. Huie continued to write full-time at home as freelance journalist and novelist. During this period, activism in the Civil Rights Movement increased and Huie was commissioned by periodicals such as the New York Herald Tribune and Look magazine to cover breaking events in the South. In 1954 the US Supreme Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, but most southern jurisdictions made no changes to their schools. Huie attended the appeal and second trial in 1954 of Ruby McCollum, a wealthy married black woman in Florida who had shot and killed her white paramour, physician and state senator-elect Dr. Leroy Adams. She testified that he had forced her to have sex and bear his child when she got pregnant. The popular married doctor was being groomed to run for Governor of Florida. Huie had been contacted about the case by writer Zora Neale Hurston, who had worked with him earlier at The American Mercury and had covered the first McCollum trial in Live Oak, Florida for the Pittsburgh Courier. The judge had prohibited McCollum from talking to the press. Huie attended the appeal and second trial, and conducted background investigations of the figures and events. He was arrested on contempt of court charges; the judge cited him for \\"meddling\\" in a trial that \\"could embarrass the community\\". Huie was soon freed from jail and he was pardoned years later. His book on the sensational case, Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail (1956), became a bestseller; it was banned in Florida. Ebony, Time, and other journals publicized McCollum's story worldwide.Tammy Evans, The Silencing of Ruby McCollum: Race, Class, and Gender in the South, University of Florida Press, 2006 Huie also reported on the lynching of African-American Chicago teenager Emmett Till in Money, Mississippi in 1955. After an all-white jury found the two defendants not guilty, Huie paid the men $4,000 for an interview. They described how and why they committed the murder, and were protected by double jeopardy from being tried again for the crime. Huie published his account in Look magazine in January 1956. Some mainstream journalists criticized what they called his \\"checkbook journalism\\".Whitfield, Stephen J. A Death in the Delta: The Story of Emmett Till JHU Press, 1991, p. 52 Huie also published a full-length book on the case, Wolf Whistle (1959). Simeon Wright, Till's cousin and an eyewitness to the events at the store and to Till's abduction, refuted the killers' version in his 2010 memoir, written with Her Boyd, Simeon's Story: An Eyewitness Account of the Kidnapping of Emmett Till.Herb Klibanoff, \\"Review: 'Simeon's Story: An Eyewitness Account of the Kidnapping of Emmett Till', Chicago Tribune, 25 February 2017; accessed 25 February 2017 Huie also reported on various Ku Klux Klan activities, including the 1964 killing of \\"Freedom Summer\\" workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner. His books on the latter included The Klansman (1965) and Three Lives for Mississippi (1965). The KKK to burned a cross on his front lawn in 1967 to try to intimidate him. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), wrote the Introduction for the second edition of Huie's Three Lives for Mississippi. He said that it \\"is a part of the arsenal decent Americans can employ to make democracy for all truly a birthright and not a distant dream. It relates the story of an atrocity committed on our doorstep.\\" Subsequent editions of the work include an \\"Afterword\\" by Juan Williams. In 1970, Huie published He Slew the Dreamer, an account of the Memphis assassination of King, for which he had interviewed assassin James Earl Ray. Huie's book The Execution of Private Slovik (1954) related the historic account of World War II G.I. Eddie Slovik, the only soldier since the American Civil War to be executed for desertion. The government had kept this quiet, not telling his widow how he died. After the book revealed Slovik's story, Huie and others tried for years to get the government to pay his widow a pension, but had no success. He had discussions with Frank Sinatra about adapting the work as a movie. Sinatra dropped it in 1960 due to objections to his choice of screenwriter, a man who was one of the Hollywood Ten blacklisted after refusing to testify to HUAC. The singer was campaigning at the time for John F. Kennedy as president. The book was later adapted as a television movie, entitled as The Execution of Private Slovik (1974), starring Martin Sheen, and aired by NBC. Later years In 1973 Huie's father died. This loss was followed several months later by the death of Huie's wife Ruth from cancer. In 1975 Huie met Martha Hunt Robertson of Guntersville, Alabama, an art instructor at a local college. They married in Huntsville, Alabama on July 16, 1977. They divided their time between their Hartselle and Guntersville homes. In a few years, the Huies moved to Scottsboro. By 1985 they resettled in Guntersville. Huie wrote one more significant book after Ruth's death. In the Hours of Night is the story of the development of the atomic bomb and its effect on its creators and policy makers. It is loosely based on the life of James Forrestal, Secretary of Defense during the height of the development. On November 20, 1986, Huie died of a heart attack. He left an unfinished novel, \\"The Adversary\\", which was intended to be the second of a trilogy that began with In the Hours of Night. Martha Huie, his widow and heir, continued to represent her late husband's literary properties. She managed ongoing projects until her death in Memphis in May 2014. Martha Huie's daughter, Mary Ben Heflin, now handles William Bradford Huie's literary properties and ongoing projects.
