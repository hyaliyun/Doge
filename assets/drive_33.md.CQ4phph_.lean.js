It is a standalone work set in a different fictional timeline from Drury's 1959 novel Advise and Consent, which earned him a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The novel was published in the United Kingdom as The Destiny Makers in 1988. Plot summary The Soviet Union invades and occupies a sparsely-populated Pacific atoll and proceeds to kill the inhabitants and gradually construct a missile and submarine base. Diplomatic overtures by the United States accomplish nothing, and military response to this Soviet threat seems necessary. Such plans, however, are frustrated by infighting within the Pentagon, Congress, and elsewhere in the government. When the novel ends, the U.S. has failed to respond and the Soviets have consolidated their hold on the atoll. Critical reception The Destiny Makers (1988, UK) Publishers Weekly called the idea behind the novel \\"promising\\" but then noted, \\"the book's merit ends with that concept\\". The review went on to criticize it as a \\"bloated, wooden novel that lacks the simplest of narrative virtues\\" and added, \\"as the Pentagon's mishandling of this crisis reaches near-buffoonery, Drury's attempted critique of a bureaucracy burdened with political infighting, waste and mismanagement unintentionally becomes almost comic for those readers with the endurance to get that far.\\" Diane D. Henderson of The Washington Monthly called the novel \\"a big, sprawling work ... [that] never quite achieves coherence or focus\\". She writes: The novel was released by Severn House Publishers in the United Kingdom as The Destiny Makers in August 1988.

The game was developed by TOSE and published by Namco in Japan and Taxan in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was later released by Bandai Namco Games for the Wii U Virtual Console worldwide in February 2015. Storyline Mappy must travel through various themed areas, collecting six target items in each one, while attempting to avoid Goro and his gang of Meowkies. The target items differ depending on the story: * Story 1: It is Mapico's birthday, and you are collecting cheese as her present. * Story 2: Mappy wishes to marry Mapico, and must collect wedding rings. * Story 3: Mappy and Mapico are having a Christmas party, and Christmas trees must be collected. * Story 4: It is Mappy Jr.'s birthday, and you are collecting baseballs for his present. After completing Story 4, it loops back to the first story. There are eight areas with various unique features, and Goro wears costumes corresponding to each theme. # Railroad Town # Western World # Tropical World # Jungle World # Pirate World # Ghost Town # Seventh Avenue # Milky Town Gameplay The gameplay is similar to the original Mappy, where you must collect items and avoid enemies with the assistance of trampolines that will break if jumped on too many times before landing (Jungle World being the one exception to this). Unlike the original, the doors and Microwave Doors are not present, and instead stage specific counterattack items can be used. Mappy can perform a short jump to trigger these items as well as collect the target items; he can also jump over the Meowkies if timed well. In addition, Mappy can carry a number of distraction items (up to 15) to temporarily stop enemies from pursuing: * Cat Toys - Meowkies will dance around these, and you can harmlessly pass them by. Goro will not be affected. * Gold Coin - Goro will dance around this and not harm you. Meowkies will not be affected. * Silver Vine Pots - Meowkies will lose consciousness. Goro will not be affected. * Fish - This will bounce forward in the direction you face. Both Goro and the Meowkies will chase it. In the Ghost Town, Mappy will use a flashlight to ward off the ghosts, and can travel the stage with a balloon. In order to finish a stage, you must collect all six target items and then proceed to the exit on the right. Sometimes in certain stories you must also locate a subarea to obtain a special item before you can exit. If you take too long to finish an area, a warning chime will sound and the music will speed up, and eventually a Goro Coin will chase you as well, which cannot be attacked or distracted. * In the Ghost Town, sometimes the subarea you must enter is reminiscent of the original Mappy game, complete with its theme music playing. However, you are only locating a doorway that leads to the next area, while all others warp you to a different doorway instead. Once you reach the last area (Milky Town) and collect all the items, you must enter the castle and play an extra area; the six target items within must be collected and brought to Mapico or Mappy Jr. before the music ends. If you fail to do this, you must retry the extra area until you are successful. When successful, bonus points are awarded and you start the next story in the first area. Later stories alter the stage layouts and the enemies become much faster. In some areas a bonus subarea can be found. These bonus subareas can reward you with additional distraction items and extra lives. In order to access these, Mappy must be carrying no distraction items and must jump on a particular trampoline without any controller input; if successful, Mappy will then be sent upwards to the bonus subarea.

He began appearing on Australian television shows in the mid-1970s, such as Homicide and Matlock Police and All the Rivers Run. He is best known to international audiences for his role of Wez in the 1981 science fiction action film Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and Bennett in the military action film Commando. After Mad Max 2, Wells began appearing in Hollywood films, such as science fiction comedies Weird Science (1985) and Innerspace (1987). In the 2000s, Wells acted in the television series Power Rangers Time Force portraying the series' main villain Ransik. Early life Wells was born in Rushworth, Victoria, the son of Eva Maude (n√©e Jackson) and Michael Wells.Vernon Wells Biography (1945‚Äì) At the age of 14 he was part of a music band, then upon graduating high school, went to University and attained a degree in Telecommunications. Career =1970s= Wells worked in a quarry, then as a salesman, and then in theatre and rock bands. In the 1970s, he was selected by casting agents to appear in a theatre play, and he started to appear in Australian TV commercials, print advertisements, local Australian TV shows such as Homicide and Matlock Police and historical TV mini-series like Against The Wind, Sara Dane and All The Rivers Run. His first cinema appearance was a minor role in Felicity (1979), a low-budget, erotic fantasy film. =1980s= Wells was cast as the homicidal biker Wez, in Mad Max 2 (1981), filmed around Silverton near Broken Hill in outback New South Wales, Australia. It is the role for which he is probably best known to international audiences, as Wells portrays a psychotic, post-apocalyptic henchman who relentlessly pursues hero Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), before meeting a spectacular death at the film's finale. Hollywood beckoned for Wells, and he spoofed his mad biker role in the popular 1985 teen comedy Weird Science, written and directed by John Hughes and produced by Joel Silver. Wells so impressed Silver with his work in that film that he was immediately secured for the role of Bennett opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in Commando (1985). When first approached for the role in Commando, Wells was in Australia working on the feature film, Fortress, based on the real-life Faraday School kidnapping, in a starring role opposite Rachel Ward. Wells appeared as Roo Marcus in Last Man Standing (1987). =1990s and 2000s= In 1992, Wells appeared in one of the few roles in which he is not cast as a villain, in the short-lived 1992 television comedy series The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys. The show was about a professor who accidentally enlarged three Sea-Monkeys to human-size, and then had to deal with their comical ineptness in the world. In 1993, Wells starred in the science fiction film Fortress with Christopher Lambert (no connection to the previous movie of the same name). Many of Wells's roles 1990s and 2000s portrayed villains, as in the films Circuitry Man (1990), Kick of Death (1997), Starforce (2000) and Power Rangers Time Force (2001). In the Power Rangers episodes, he played the role of Ransik, a mutant crime lord from the year 3000 who travels back in time to take over the world. In 2002, he reprised this role for the Power Rangers Wild Force/Time Force two-part team-up episode \\"Reinforcements from the Future\\".

It is located in the Between the Hills area of the Loudoun Valley on Harpers Ferry Road (Virginia Secondary Route 671) at the foot of Short Hill Mountain. It is notable for being the birthplace of Confederate guerrilla John Mobberly. History Neersville derives its name from the Neer brothers, Conrad and William, who were the first to lease and later own the land around the present village. Their land deeds began in 1786. The village began to coalesce around the dependencies of the Near farms in 1834 when the Lutheran Church was given a half acre on which they constructed St. Paul's Church. Within five years, the post office established a branch in the village which they christened Neersville and, with it, the \\"Capitol City\\" of Between the Hills was born. The village continued to prosper in the antebellum years, boasting two mills, a saw and grist, by 1850. Unfortunately because of the limited flow of Piney Run, only one could operate at a time. The village suffered some during the Civil War, mostly by the burning of the bridge across the Potomac River, which kept the isolated village connected to the Harpers Ferry and the outside world via the B&O; Railroad and C&O; Canal. Though the village was occupied by both armies during the war, no real fighting took place there. Following the conflict, the village began to prosper again, especially with the opening of Sagle Road, which cut from the Harpers Ferry Road at the village to the Charles Town Pike (present day Rt. 9) just east of Keyes Gap and the opening of the Nathaniel Prince Road, which led east from the village across the Short Hill, connecting the village to Lovettsville. By 1872 the village even boasted a school. The 20th century was not so kind to Neersville. The population began to dwindle, the school closed in 1930, the general store closed in 1956 and by 1970 even St. Paul's had closed its doors. Furthermore Nathaniel Prince Road was not incorporated into the county road system and thus was never graded and maintained for automobile use, thereby cutting off the village from Lovettsville.

Playing career Selected in 1970 by the Philadelphia Flyers, Kelly was an aggressive left-winger who became a member of the famous \\"Broad Street Bullies\\" and helped guide the Flyers to their two consecutive Stanley Cup championships in 1974 and 1975. Along with teammate Dave Schultz, Kelly was one of the team's top enforcers. Kelly scored the 1975 Cup-winning goal 11 seconds into the third period of game six. In a tremendous individual effort, he stole the puck behind the Sabres' net and was able to slide the puck under goalie Roger Crozier. Kelly played with the Flyers until the 1979‚Äì80 NHL season when he was traded to the Washington Capitals. He had a career year offensively in his first season with the Capitals, scoring 26 goals and 36 assists for a total of 62 points. After playing on a checking line with the Flyers, he was promoted to the Capitals' top line, alongside Jean Pronovost and Mike Gartner and proved to be an excellent complement to the two highly- skilled players, using his size to create space for them. He also played regularly on the power play for the only time of his career, scoring 8 of his career 14 power play goals that season. However, after playing 16 games during the first two months of the 1981‚Äì82 season, the Capitals and Kelly mutually agreed to terminate his contract and Kelly retired. He is now the Flyers' ambassador of hockey, visiting schools and teaching kids about the importance of teamwork.

It is located at the intersection of McFarland Boulevard and Veterans' Memorial Parkway in Tuscaloosa, the busiest in the city. Owned and managed by the Montgomery-based Aronov Realty, the mall opened on August 20, 1980. Anchor stores of the enclosed mall include JCPenney (), the vacant Sears (), Belk Women (), and Belk Men, Home & Kids (). The only outlier property on mall premises is a branch of Regions Bank. The property where University Mall now stands was previously home to the ruins of World War II-era Northington Naval Hospital and associated support buildings. These ruins were finally destroyed during the filming of the climactic scene of the 1978 Burt Reynolds film Hooper. The ruins of the hospital had lain derelict for many years and included a few dozen buildings as well as two immensely tall brick smoke-stacks. A few of the old barracks buildings remained until 2000; they housed the Tuscaloosa City Board of Education offices until they were relocated to the old Tuscaloosa High School (later Tuscaloosa Middle School) building on Queen City Avenue.

Biography She was born 26 January 1907 in Mor√≥n, in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. She was the fourth daughter of Juan Carlos Anido and Betilda Gonz√°lez Rigaud. Her family moved to Buenos Aires when she was very young. She studied with Domingo Prat in Argentina and Miguel Llobet in Spain. From 1925, she frequently performed in Argentina together with Llobet. Her first London appearance was in 1952 at the Wigmore Hall, and she spent several years in the 1960s performing and teaching in Russia. later she became professor at the conservatory of Buenos Aires.Powrozniak, J√≥zef: Gitarren-Lexikon (Berlin: Verlag Neue Musik, 3rd edition 1986). By the mid-1980s she lived again near Barcelona and died in Tarragona. Mar√≠a Luisa Anido's compositions for guitar :\\"Composing is a wonderful task because of the sincerity it carries within, because of the act of creation [‚Ä¶] because it reveals the greatest depths of the human soul.\\" ‚Äî Mar√≠a Luisa Anido Mar√≠a Luisa Anido has been one of the few female composer-performers of her time. Her compositions are mainly miniatures that reflect several aspects of her personality. Aire Norte√±o, her most popular piece, is a 'Bailecito', a little dance present in all festivities in north-western Argentina, which is generally accompanied by charangos, quenas and cajas. Anido frequently plays the bass notes pizzicato to emphasise the juxtaposition of 3/4 time in the bass and 6/8 in the melody, a characteristic that is frequently found in Argentine folklore. In 1927, Anido composed her first piece, Barcarola. Miguel Llobet, the Catalan guitarist, wrote to her shortly after that: \\"I have read and played your Barcarola; the voices are carried magnificently with admirable taste of their natural characteristics; the tone colours are perfect. Bravo, very well done. I think you should continue writing your excellent inspirations.\\" In Canci√≥n del Yucat√°n, Anido alternates the characteristic Habanera rhythm with triples and rubatos that mark the sweet and feminine character of the piece. Following Llobet's example, she recreates, through glissandi and exquisite legato, the intimate atmosphere of the Mexican song 'Adi√≥s ‚Ä¶ Adi√≥s ‚Ä¶'. Much of her music is inspired by Argentine folklore. Preludio campero illustrates the attitude of the gaucho as he improvises chords on his guitar until a small melody appears, without any hurry, with the tranquillity and liberty that the immensity of the pampas imparts. A pedal in De mi Tierra rocks in a continuous movement. She is not afraid of the high positions on the guitar, so she plays with melodies in the higher notes, contrasting with that ostinato bass. In 1952, she travelled through Europe for the first time, and B√®rben in Italy published her Aire de Vidalita. This piece was inspired by one of the most popular lyric songs of Argentine folklore. The musicologist Carlos Vega said: ‚ÄúThe 'vidalitas' are little songs of various characters and tempos. Sometimes they are tender love songs, sometimes cheerful, lively carnival songs. They became especially popular in Buenos Aires by the end of the 19th century. Their poetic form is not uniform, but generally it is a quatrain where the word 'vidalita' appears between the first and second and between the third and the fourth lines as follows: :los d√≠as mas bellos, vidalita :tienen su hora amarga :y hasta en la agon√≠a, vidalita :luce la esperanza. Mar√≠a Luisa Anido prepares the theme with four bars of guitaristic arpeggios. The melody of the piece respects its characteristic rhythm, but instead of flowing in a homophone way or through parallel thirds, sixths or tenths, it is built as a chorale in four voices, which gives it a special depth. The Gato that concludes this group is one of the most popular dances. Its chorography can vary according to the region where it is danced, but it always keeps a picaresque character, and, like most Argentine dances, is repeated twice. After an introduction of 8 bars (generally accompanied by the dancers and audience clapping hands) the melody flows wittily and freely over a very simple harmonic ground. Departing from folkloric influences, Anido composed Canci√≥n de Cuna, which was published in Italy in 1953. The triplet figure that serves as upbeat to each bar reflects the rocking movement of a cradle or a mother's arms. This impressionist miniature once again reveals her acute sensitivity. Impressiones Argentinas was published in Argentina in 1953. This is a set of nine pieces that embrace almost all the nuances of Argentine folklore. In Boceto ind√≠gena, dedicated to Lalyta Almir√≥n (a child prodigy born in 1914 who was the first Argentine guitarist to play in Europe), Anido alternates a Baguala rhythm with a tempo de danza and uses one of her favourite and original effects: harmonic tones in the basses of a two-voice melody. Damped basses or notes plucked with the tip of the thumb (Anido did not use her thumbnail) add a special colour to the accompaniment. In Preludio Pampeano, a melody that is carried in thirds, gives way to a tempo de Vidalita. Variaciones camperas, whose rhythmical alternation between 3/4 and 6/8, represents an invitation to dance, belong to the same geographical region. Santiague√±a' (dedicated to her agent Omar Buschiazzo) is a characteristic Chacarera from Santiago del Estero, and Catamarque√±a, based on the Vidala that is typical of Catamarca. The Vidala is a song cried to the winds and to the echoes of the ravines, singing of love, forgiveness, landscapes, and religion. After an instrumental introduction, Anido presents the theme of the 'Catamarque√±a' the way a Vidala is usually sung, in parallel thirds. Some ornaments in the melody imitate the typical kenko (melodic ornamentation). The pizzicato basses remind us of the caja, whose percussion generally accompanies the melody. Returning to the Pampas area, the \\"Alegremente\\" of Preludio Criollo contrasts with the mainly obscure tones of Canto a la Llanura. El Misachico (also called by Anido \\"Procesi√≥n Coya\\") is dedicated to her mother. In the northwest of Argentina, Misachico is the name given to small processions, carrying the profusely ornamented image of a saint that belongs to a family, not to the church. Some musicians accompany them playing erkes, violins and cajas or bombos. The Preludios Nost√°lgicos reflect the periods in which Anido lived far away from her country. Lejan√≠a, dedicated to her pupil Omar Atreo, was composed in 1962 and published in 1971 in Buenos Aires. Mar and Gris were published in Spain in 1977. An impressionistic atmosphere imbues their arpeggiated chordal structure. Lejan√≠a shows its melancholy through slow arpeggios, Mar flows in continuous movement and transformation and Gris reflects a feeling of peace and plenitude.The text above is derived from the comments for the CD A Mimita, played by Mar√≠a Isabel Siewers and released by Acqua Records in Argentina in 2007.

The ship was built for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) and delivered to the USSB 28 November 1920 by Oscar Daniels Company, in Tampa, Florida. The company built a ship designated Design 1027, standard cargo, Oscar Daniels type of which ten were built. The ship was apparently launched and delivered on the same day and not completed for some time. After delivery City of Dalhart, then a steam vessel held in the James River, was selected by the USSB to be converted from the delivered reciprocating steam engine to diesel power. Eight of the vessels delivered by the Oscar Daniels Company were among fourteen designated for conversion. Difficulty with foreign patents required new contracting for the engines and auxiliary equipment for full conversion to a motor ship. According to Maritime Administration information the ship was completed 28 February 1921 and given official number 221006; however, it is not clear whether the new engines had been installed that quickly as they were being contracted for months before. Shipping reports show the MV City of Dalhart in the Pacific and Indian Ocean trade by 1928. On 21 February 1940 the Maritime Commission, owner of the ship, awarded United States Lines the routes and ships of the Commission owned American Pioneer Line. City of Dalhart was among the ships involved and awarded with a charter bid of $4,776.20 per month. After tests on land the Brodie landing system was first tested in September 1943 for shipboard use with an installation on City of Dalhart. Staff Sergeant R. A. Gregory made ten good takeoffs and hookups with a Stinson L-5 light plane. City of Dalhart was acquired by the Navy 29 February 1944 under bareboat charter from the War Shipping Administration. On 2 June 1944 the ship was commissioned as USS City of Dalhart at San Francisco, California designated IX-156 with Lieutenant Commander C. M. Lokey, USNR, in command to report to the Pacific Fleet. City of Dalhart stood out from San Francisco 9 June 1944, carrying sailors and cargo to Pearl Harbor. Assigned as a mobile barracks for the 301st Naval Construction Battalion, she departed Pearl Harbor 16 July with the men and machinery of this unit aboard, called at Eniwetok from 3 August to 5 August, and put into Guam on 11 August, one day after the island was declared secure. She remained at Guam until 22 November, when she sailed for San Francisco arriving 19 December. City of Dalhart was decommissioned on 28 January 1946, and returned to her owner. City of Dalhart received one battle star for World War II service. The ship was sold to Florida Pipe and Supply Company for $10,250 for delivery to be scrapped 22 January 1947.

This is a segmental dysfunction which persists for a variable period of time, about two weeks, even after ischemia has been relieved (by for instance angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery). In this situation, while myocardial blood flow (MBF) returns to normal, function is still depressed for a variable period of time. Myocardial stunning is the reversible reduction of function of heart contraction after reperfusion not accounted for by tissue damage or reduced blood flow. After total ischemia occurs, the myocardium switches immediately from aerobic glycolysis to anaerobic glycolysis resulting in the reduced ability to produce high energy phosphates such as ATP and Creatinine Phosphate. At this point, the lack of the energy and lactate accumulation results in cessation of contraction within 60 seconds of ischemia (i.e. Vessel Occlusion). Subsequent to this is a period of \\"myocardial stunning,\\" in which reversible ischemic damage is taking place. At approximately 30 minutes after the onset of total ischemia the damage becomes irreversible, thereby ending the phase of myocardial stunning. Clinical situations of stunned myocardium are: * acute myocardial infarction (AMI) * after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) * after cardiac surgery * 'neurogenic' stunned myocardium following an acute cerebrovascular event such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage * in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, chronic myocardial stunning may lead to heart failure  References  Further reading  \\"Myocardial ‚Äústunning‚Äù in man\\"   External links  Category:Heart diseases ","title":"Myocardial stunning"},{"id":"5995495","text":"Paeonian Springs is an unincorporated community in Loudoun County, Virginia, United States.

Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause allowed a state to impose a life sentence without the possibility of parole for the possession of 672 grams of cocaine.. The Court's narrow ruling left a major question of Eighth Amendment law unresolved. Since the Court's decision in Gregg v. Georgia,. the Court had incorporated a detailed proportionality analysis into the cruel and unusual punishment analysis required in capital cases. The defendant Ronald Harmelin directly asked the Court to extend the reach of that analysis to noncapital cases such as his. Although five Justices agreed that Harmelin's sentence was not unconstitutionally cruel and unusual, six Justices agreed that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause bore some kind of proportionality analysis. Yet among those six, three supported a proportionality principle that is highly deferential to legislative judgments, while three others supported a more searching proportionality analysis that would have struck down Michigan's mandatory life-without-parole sentence for possessing more than 650 grams of cocaine (672 grams). The State of Michigan was represented by Richard Thompson and Michael Modelski. Thompson's other credits include serving as a prosecutor of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Various state attorneys general, as well as the United States Solicitor General, filed amicus curiae briefs on behalf of the State of Michigan. The Court-appointed counsel for Harmelin, the ACLU and a group of criminal defense attorneys filed briefs in support of the defendant's position. The majority ruling The only aspect of the decision that garnered the vote of five Justices was the ultimate conclusion that the mandatory life without parole sentence required by the Michigan law forbidding the possession of more than 650 grams of cocaine was not cruel and unusual punishment. \\"Severe, mandatory penalties may be cruel, but they are not unusual in the constitutional sense, having been employed in various forms throughout our Nation's history.\\" Nor did the Eighth Amendment require a sentencing court to consider mitigating factors in noncapital cases. It was enough that Michigan law allowed for executive clemency, or that the legislature might at some later date retroactively reduce the sentence for Harmelin's crime. The proportionality debate The Justices could not agree, however, whether and to what extent the Eighth Amendment imposed a proportionality requirement in noncapital sentencing proceedings. Justice Antonin Scalia, as is typical of his originalist interpretation of the Constitution, introduced historical evidence in support of his argument that the Eighth Amendment imposes no proportionality requirement at all. Justice Anthony Kennedy argued in favor of a vague proportionality principle that allowed the Court to uphold Harmelin's sentence. And Justice Byron White argued that Harmelin's sentence was the sort of \\"excessive\\" sentence forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. =Scalia's originalist argument= Through his opinion in Harmelin, Justice Scalia voiced his disagreement with the Court's decision in Solem v. Helm, , which was decided before he was appointed to the Court. He first identified the English Bill of Rights of 1689 as the source of the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. According to Scalia, Solem assumed that the Americans who adopted the Eighth Amendment in 1791 understood that language in the same way as the English of 1689. Scalia disputed this hypothesis. He pointed to a dispute among historians about which royal abuses the Declaration was intended to combat. Some historians contend that these abuses were the harsh punishments for treasondrawing and quartering, beheading, disembowelingmeted out by the Bloody Assizes. Other historians contend that the Declaration was meant to rein in the enormously arbitrary sentencing power the king had exercised in sentencing a notorious perjurer. Regardless, Scalia argued that those who wrote the Declaration considered a punishment to be \\"cruel and unusual\\" only if it were outside of the judge's power to impose. The phrase \\"'cruel and unusual' is treated as interchangeable with 'cruel and illegal.'\\" For this reason, the English of the 17th century did not believe a \\"cruel and unusual\\" punishment was a disproportionate one. For Scalia, though, the more important question was what the words \\"cruel and unusual\\" meant to the Framers of the Bill of Rights in 1791 when the Eighth Amendment was adopted. \\"Even if one assumes that the Founders knew the precise meaning of that English antecedent..., a direct transplant of the English meaning to the soil of American constitutionalism would in any case have been impossible.\\" Because federal common law incorporated no common-law crimes, the Framers could only have meant to check legislative power. They understood the word \\"unusual\\" to refer to things that were \\"not regularly or customarily employed.\\" Furthermore, if the Framers had meant to outlaw 'disproportional' punishments, they would have used that word, as many contemporary state constitutions did. \\"There is little doubt that those who framed, proposed, and ratified the Bill of Rights were aware of such provisions [outlawing disproportional punishments], yet chose not to replicate them.\\" Finally, the scant direct evidence available from state ratifying conventions confirmed for Scalia the view that an \\"unusual punishment\\" was a particular mode of punishment that was infrequently imposed, not one that was excessively lengthy in comparison to other punishments imposed for similar crimes. For these reasons, Scalia argued that the proportionality test from Solem should be overruled. Solem had held that a particular punishment was unconstitutionally disproportional if (1) the crime was relatively minor in comparison to the punishment, (2) the sentence imposed in the jurisdiction for similarly grave offenses was less, and (3) other jurisdictions impose a lesser sentence for the same crime. Scalia argued that (1) it was difficult to assess the gravity of a particular crime, and thus (2) it would be difficult to determine whether similarly grave crimes carried a lesser sentence. As for whether other jurisdictions imposed a lesser sentence for the same crime, Scalia conceded that it is easy to figure this out, but that this inquiry has \\"no conceivable relevance to the Eighth Amendment.\\" If a mode of punishment was \\"unusual\\" because it was infrequently imposed, the three factors of the Solem test hardly mattered to Scalia. In a federal system, moreover, some state will always have the distinction of imposing the harshest punishment for a particular crime. \\"The Eighth Amendment is not a ratchet, whereby a temporary consensus on leniency for a particular crime fixes a permanent constitutional maximum, disabling the States from giving effect to altered beliefs and responding to changed social conditions.\\" Because the proportionality requirement was of recent vintage, \\"issued 185 years after the Eighth Amendment was adopted,\\" and then only in capital cases, Scalia reasoned it should be abandoned entirely, or at least limited only to capital cases. =White's proportionality argument= Justice White's point of departure was the fact that \\"the Amendment does not refer to proportionality in so many words, but it does forbid 'excessive' fines, a restraint that suggests that a determination of excessiveness should be based at least in part on whether the fine imposed is disproportionate to the crime committed.\\" Accordingly, the Eighth Amendment imposed a strong proportionality requirement not simply on fines, but on all criminal punishments, including prison terms. White took issue with three premises of Scalia's argument. First, for White, the fact that the Framers were not as plain-spoken as Scalia would have preferred was no obstacle to concluding that the Eighth Amendment did indeed contain a proportionality requirement. Second, although the newly formed federal government did not, in 1791, have any \\"track record with respect to criminal law,\\" they had lived under the regime of the several states for some time, and so there would be some benchmarks by which to evaluate proportionality of punishments. Third, even if the original understanding of the Eighth Amendment did not include a proportionality requirement, 20th-century decisions of the Court had imposed one. White takes Scalia to task for claiming at once that the Eighth Amendment must have no proportionality guarantee whatsoever and then that that guarantee can apply only in capital cases. White's argument proceeds from the premise that \\"the scope of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments has long understood the limitations of a purely historical analysis.\\" In other words, when it comes to the Eighth Amendment, the Court must employ a flexible and dynamic interpretation. > The Court therefore has recognized that a punishment may violate the Eighth > Amendment if it is contrary to the evolving standards of decency that mark > the progress of a maturing society. In evaluating a punishment under this > test, we have looked not to our own conceptions of decency, but to those of > modern American society as a whole in determining what standards have > evolved, and thus have focused not on the subjective views of individual > Justices, but on objective factors to the maximum possible extent.\\" It is > this type of objective factor which forms the basis for the tripartite > proportionality analysis set forth in Solem. Finally, White argued that the Solem test works well in practice. Simply because courts will be reviewing sentences for proportionality does not mean that courts will strike them down with great frequency. Solem requires a certain amount of deference to the legislature, and courts have proven able to apply that amount of deference. And although Scalia concedes that an egregious prison termsuch as life in prison for overtime parkingwould be unconstitutional, White faults him for striking such extreme punishments down in a principled manner. White also argues that adopting Scalia's view of the proportionality requirement would strike at the foundation of the Court's capital punishment jurisprudence, much of which would then \\"rest on quicksand\\". =Kennedy's \\"narrow proportionality principle\\"= Justice Kennedy, joined by Justices O'Connor and Souter, attempted to forge a middle ground between the positions of Justices Scalia and White. Justice Kennedy argued that \\"stare decisis counsels our adherence to the narrow proportionality principle that has existed in our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence for 80 years.\\" Under Kennedy's formulation of the proportionality principle, Harmelin's sentence could stand, along with the possibility that an equally harsh sentence for a less severe crime might not. As an initial matter, Kennedy identified four principles that undergird the Eighth Amendment's proportionality principle as he understood it. First, \\"the fixing of prison terms for specific crimes involves a substantive penological judgment that, as a general matter, is properly within the province of legislatures, not courts.\\" Second, the Eighth Amendment does not mandate the adoption of one theory of punishment over anotherstates are free to tailor their punishments to meet the needs of either a deterrence rationale, a retribution rationale, or both or some other rationale. Third, in light of these first two principles, there is bound to be some variation of punishments between and within particular jurisdictions. Thus, the intra- and interjurisdictional comparison required by the Solem test would frequently prove unworkable. Fourth, any proportionality analysis required by the Eighth Amendment should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent. Justice Kennedy pointed to the two aspects of Harmelin's sentence that might cause difficulty under the Eighth Amendmentthe severity of the sentence, along with its mandatory nature. Life without parole is the second most severe sentence known to American law, after the death penalty. Yet Harmelin's crime was more severe than the crime at issue in Solem. In Solem, the Court struck down a life-without-parole sentence imposed for the crime of uttering a no-account check; Harmelin, however, was convicted of possessing 650 grams of cocaine. Uttering is \\"one of the most passive felonies a person could commit.\\" The illegal drug trade, by contrast, begets a tremendous amount of violence. In view of these observations, a legislature could rationally conclude that a life sentence without parole is appropriate to deter others from distributing cocaine and to achieve an appropriate amount of retribution. Because Harmelin's crime was more serious than the crimes involved in other cases where the Court had confronted the constitutionality of a life sentence, Kennedy reasoned that it might be appropriate to dispense with the detailed Solem analysis. \\"A better reading of our cases leads to the conclusion that intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional analyses are appropriate only in the rare case in which a threshold comparison of the crime committed and the sentence imposed leads to an inference of gross disproportionality.\\" The mandatory nature of Harmelin's sentence also did not require setting it aside. First, as Scalia agreed, the Eighth Amendment did not require the trial court to allow Harmelin to present mitigating evidence. Second, if the Court were to set Harmelin's sentence aside, it would necessarily have to reject the judgment of the legislature, where the initial responsibility for making the substantive judgment about appropriate punishments rests. Third, Michigan's system did not entirely lack mechanisms for considering the individual circumstances of a particular defendant. Prosecutors have discretion in bringing charges, the governor has the power to grant clemency post hoc, and the legislature has the power to retroactively modify the sentence for all persons convicted of Harmelin's crime. White's criticism of Kennedy's argument For Justice White, Kennedy's narrow proportionality principle effectively \\"eviscerates\\" Solem, leaving only an \\"empty shell\\" in its place. How could the inter- and intrajurisdictional comparisons required by Solem be anything but objective? And if, as Kennedy conceded, proportionality analysis should be informed by objective factors as much as possible, how else could those objective factors come into play except through the Solem test? See the lengthy discussion in support of the Solem test in chapters 1 and 2 in Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate, 2011) Because White disagreed that Solem should be abandoned, he proceeded to apply it to Harmelin's sentence, and concluded that Harmelin's sentence was unconstitutional. First, because Michigan has no death penalty, the life-without-parole sentence for possession of 650 grams of cocaine was the most severe available under Michigan law. Second, it reserved the sentence for only one other crimefirst-degree murder. Third, no other jurisdiction imposed such a severe sentence for possession of 650 grams of cocaine. Alabama came close, White observed, but only when the defendant possessed 10 kilograms of cocaine. Thus, White concluded, Solem required the Court to strike down Harmelin's sentence.

He orders his talented son Girdhar to demonstrate to the audience the true method of classical dance. Entranced by Girdhar's skill, Neela begs Mangal to admit her as a pupil. He finally agrees on two conditions: she must devote her life to art and she must partner Girdhar in the Tandav portion of an upcoming dance competition. As the two practice together, she begins to fall in love with Girdhar. Manilal, a wealthy and jealous man who hopes to have Neela for himself, warns Mangal that the two are falling in love, but he ignores him. When Mangal goes away for some time to buy new costumes for the pair, they confess their love to each other and neglect their dancing in favor of idyllic walks and boat rides. Mangal returns and discovers that the two are in love. Enraged that Girdhar's dancing has suffered and believing that he will now never win the title of Bharat Natarajan, he renounces his son and resolves to leave him. Dismayed that she has endangered Girdhar's career, Neela pretends that she has betrayed him with Manilal and he returns to his father and his art. The devastated Neela tries to drown herself in the river, but is rescued by a kindly sadhu. She decides to follow the example of the minstrel Meerabai and devotes her life to Krishna, but is alarmed when Girdhar appears, declaring that he can not forget her. She pretends not to know him and he is enraged; his father takes him away. She becomes ill and the sadhu and her servant Bindiya take her to the temple where the dance competition is being held. Hoping to sabotage his chances, Manilal has bribed Girdhar's new partner to drop out of the competition. Neela takes her place in the Tandav dance and Mangal realizes that she spurned Girdhar to help him win the competition. He then convinces his son to give her a second chance. With the help of Neela, Girdhar wins the competition and Mangal gives the couple his blessing to marry. Music Vasant Desai composed the music and Hasrat Jaipuri wrote the lyrics for the film. The song \\"Jo Tum Todo Piya\\", inspired by Meerabai was later also used for the 1981 film Silsila. Shivkumar Sharma, the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan recipient musician has played Santoor in this film. Santoor was used for the first time in Indian Cinema.

It was written and directed by Hal Haberman and Jeremy Passmore. The film was released in theatres in the United Kingdom on November 17, 2006 and on DVD in the United Kingdom on March 5, 2007. It was released in theatres in the United States on November 21, 2008. Plot Comic book fan Les Franken (Michael Rapaport) signs up for an experimental antidepressant. Dr. Dobson (Jack Kehler) instructs him to take one pill per day. Les creates a diary for his experiences but feels no results. His lack of self-assurance keeps him from getting to know Maggie (Alexandra Holden), a quiet girl who works at a grocery store. After several days of taking the pill, Les experiences supernatural powers, beginning with the ability to float. Paying a visit to Dobson, he sees himself floating, but Dobson sees him lying on the floor; Les has no powers at all. He explains that Les is having an adverse psychotic reaction to the drug and orders him to stop taking it. Les instead convinces himself that he has telepathy and Dobson is mentally telling him to continue taking the drug. Gaining self-confidence, Les quits his job in order to become a crime-fighting vigilante. He gains a reputation for tackling people after stopping a gunman from robbing Maggie's store, believing he is picking up telepathic intent from would-be perpetrators. He confides his new gifts to best friends Joey (Josh Peck) and Everett (Robert Baker). Their initial reaction to his supposed ability to walk through walls is curiously ambiguous. The viewer only sees what Les believes he is doing rather than what his two friends actually witness. Les offers his services to the police but has to flee when he is recognized as the mystery \\"crime fighter\\". After Dobson learns that Les is still taking the drug and getting worse, he calls on two representatives, Ted (Ian Bohen) and Jonas (Paul Blackthorne), to talk Les out of taking the drugs. Les believes they are there to take his powers away (as he is confronted by an alternate version of himself \\"from a future that will now never exist\\"), so his \\"future self\\" stabs Jonas in the ear and Les runs off with Ted in pursuit on foot. Les \\"teleports\\" behind Ted and knocks him out and then escapes again. Just how he actually accomplishes this highly improbable sneak attack is left for the viewer to grapple with. Les then joins Everett and Joey who believe \\"the suits\\" are just as much of an hallucination as everything else. On the way to meeting with Dobson, Les astounds his two friends by stopping a purse snatcher. Dobson claims never to have met Les before but gives the two friends a liquid to flush the medication from Les's body. Les leaves all three and finds that Jonas and Ted have broken into his apartment and are reading through his diary, talking about kidnapping him for a few days for the drug to work its way out of his system. Dobson confesses that Les's reaction could ruin the company if the word got out. While Dobson explains that he himself was only attempting to preserve his own career and life, Les takes the opportunity to swallow the remaining pills. After Les leaves and makes Ted and Jonas \\"disappear\\", the now-invisible pair beat Les to a pulp and utterly humiliate him in the process. With an unbelievable effort of sheer willpower, Les turns the tables and knocks both men unconscious. Realizing that he is losing his mind, he runs to Maggie for help. She reveals that she likes him but has been reluctant to speak to him because of a stutter. Les admits to liking her and requests to be locked up in the restroom until the drug leaves his system. Les awakens the following morning to find he cannot float. As Les is walking home Jonas runs him down with his car. Jonas is about to leave Les for dead when, incredibly, Les raises himself up off of the asphalt and stands defiantly there in the middle of the street. Jonas angrily backs the car into Les and sends him flying over the roof again, presumably finishing him off. This is too much for Ted and he flees the scene on foot. But Les won't stay down. In yet another fantastic feat of willpower, Les drags himself up onto his feet and faces-off with Jonas's car. Jonas intends to run Les down once and for all, but, faced with Les's unbreakable spirit, his rage drains away. Les turns and hobbles off, a smile spreading across his bruised face.

He was surrounded by Prince Boleslaus I's retainers and dragged to the gallows. The chroniclers tell us that his body was left hanging for several years.

It was also the oldest extant enclosed shopping mall (after The Heart of Huntsville Mall closed) in the city until its closure in 2017. The mall was located on the corner of University Drive (US 72) and Research Park Boulevard (SR-255). In late January 2017, the mall permanently closed after 32 years of operation. Demolition of the former mall began on February 6, 2017. The property was redeveloped into MidCity District beginning in 2017. History Madison Square Mall opened on August 1, 1984, with anchors JCPenney, Parisian, Castner Knott, Pizitz, and a Sears which relocated from Heart of Huntsville Mall. Junior anchors included Yielding and Blach's. The opening day ceremonies were attended by the Miss America 1984 contestant, Suzette Charles, in her first public appearance as the successor to Vanessa Williams after she was forced to resign the title due to unauthorized publication of nude photographs. Over time, some of the anchors moved or were bought out by bigger companies. Blach's was closed by 1987 and replaced by The Limited and Victoria's Secret. Pizitz was acquired by Jackson, Mississippi-based McRae's in 1988 and renamed as such until McRae's was acquired by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Belk. Castner Knott was acquired in 1998 by Dillard's. Yielding closed their Madison Square Mall location around 1993. For the next 10 years, the space was used by Castner Knott/Dillard's for their menswear. Until 2008, Steve & Barry's used the space. In 2007, Belk, after purchasing Parisian, moved its store from the former McRae's space to the much larger former Parisian space and renovated it to fit the Belk model. The former McRae's building remained vacant from then until the mall closed. Belk departed for Bridge Street Town Center in late 2014. In addition to the in-line mall stores, several other businesses are located in the Madison Square complex, including a Holiday Inn hotel, a Steak 'n Shake restaurant, and a TouchStar Cinemas movie theater. Former businesses in the complex include Romano's Macaroni Grill and Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon. Madison Square Mall had been renovated twice since its opening, first in 1994 and again in 2006.  Decline and Closure (2006-2017)  In the years following the renovation of 2006, a decrease in foot traffic and an increased crime threat led to many tenants of the mall relocating to other locations. A riot erupted in December 2012 over the new Nike Air Jordan; police had to use pepper spray to calm the situation. No arrests were made. In July 2014, a video surfaced online of a Belk employee attempting to fight off a shoplifter in the parking lot. In September 2015, a woman was robbed at gunpoint in the parking lot of the mall. Madison Square Mall's food court empty in 2016 The pilot episode of the Food Network show, Food Court Wars was filmed at this mall. Kettle N' Spouts, the winner of the episode, received a year's worth of free rent in the mall that was valued at $100,000. Kettle N' Spouts closed only 6 months after the episode aired. Madison Square Mall was owned by CBL & Associates Properties, Inc., until it was sold to The Grove Huntsville LLC for $5 million in late April 2015. The property will be redeveloped, despite struggles with the city of Huntsville against property owners Sears, JCPenney, and most notably TouchStar Cinemas, who started a petition on June 7, 2016 to prevent their property from being demolished. Not even 24 hours later, the petition achieved over 1,000 signatures. Huntsville's Director of Urban Development, Shane Davis, made a statement regarding this move, and confirmed that the theater will not be demolished, and instead the plans would be reworked around the property. Madison Square Mall began liquidation in summer 2016. The last liquidation sale ended on January 8, 2017. On November 28, 2016, Sears announced it would be closing on January 29, 2017, making it the last tenant or anchor to close in the mall. Sears also announced it would return to the MidCity Huntsville development that will replace Madison Square Mall in a smaller store. In December 2016, JCPenney announced it would close on January 28, 2017. It is unknown if JCPenney will remain in the Huntsville area. With the closure of Sears and JCPenney, Madison Square Mall permanently closed on January 29, 2017. Demolition of the former mall began on February 6, 2017. The property will be redeveloped into MidCity Huntsville with Phase 1 slated to open in late 2017. As of July 2017, the mall has been completely demolished. In April 2017, construction of Topgolf began.

The squadron remained in the Solomon Islands until September 1943, fighting over the Russell Islands, New Georgia and Vella Levella. Following the fighting in the Solomons, the squadron was disbanded and reconstituted back in the United States where it trained in the Mojave Desert at Marine Corps Auxiliary Airfield Mojave for the next year. When they received their orders for carrier assignments they had 5 combat experienced pilots as their training nucleus VMF-124 left the States again on 18 September 1944, heading to Hawaii. While in Hawaii they were attached to Carrier Air Group 4 who were operating off the aircraft carrier . Along with VMF-213, 124 became the first Marine squadron to be based on a fleet aircraft carrier. While deployed aboard the Essex, they took part in fighting over Lingayen, Luzon, Formosa, Tokyo, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. On 3 January 1945 VMF-124 and VMF-213 struck Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands in the first Marine land strike off a carrier. =Reserve activity= The squadron was reformed shortly after the war at Naval Air Station Memphis and were equipped with the F4U-4 Corsair. They were the first squadron in the newly formed Marine Air Reserve Training Command to reach full strength. The squadron was redesignated Marine Attack Squadron 124 (VMA-124) on May 1, 1965 and were subsequently equipped with the A-4 Skyhawk. During the 1970s and 1980s they flew various versions of the A-4 until 1994 when the squadron was moved to Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth and redesignated Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 124 (VMFA-124).

It operates as an independent not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the Australian government. The Academy's Strategic Plan 2020-25 outlines the Academy's purpose - to ensure the humanities in Australia thrive and excel, because we believe a better future for all humanity depends on ethical, historical, creative and cultural knowledge and expertise - and objectives: * Preserve & advance knowledge: Promote the advancement of Australian society by investing in humanities research capacity and encouraging global engagement and collaboration for researchers. * Inspire excellence: Ensure that outstanding research across the humanities is recognised, encouraged and celebrated through our Fellowship election, grants and awards programs, and public engagement initiatives. * Inform & influence: Be trusted and influential advisors to government, the media, and the research, education and cultural sectors, through evidence-led policy advice and development. Drive knowledge-sharing between government, research, industry and cultural sectors. * Lead & champion: Promote the value and benefits of research and teaching in the humanities. Be the focal point for the Australian humanities community, including those studying, working or trained in the humanities. * Promote ideas, skills & creativity: Empower communities, the economy and society through the sharing of cultural and creative knowledge and practice, and the skills required for a diverse, adaptable and creative workforce  History  The Australian Academy of the Humanities was established by Royal Charter in 1969. Its antecedent was the Australian Humanities Research Council (AHRC), which was convened informally in 1954 through the combined efforts of Dr Brian R. Elliott and Professor A.N. Jeffares, who organised preliminary meetings in Melbourne of delegates drawn from the Faculties of Arts in Australian universities. The AHRC was a positive force in education and scholarship, and its activities gradually evolved, especially in its support for national projects in the humanities. Recognition among the AHRC executive of the changing functions of the Council led in 1967 to the proposal of establishing an Academy. Royal consent was granted to the petition on 25 June 1969, and Letters Patent issued, constituting the Academy from that date. The Academy's Foundation Fellows were the members the AHRC. The highest distinction in scholarship in the humanities was required of candidates for election to the Fellowship of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. The first intake comprising sixteen Fellows (including Geoffrey Blainey, Kenneth Inglis, John Mulvaney, David Monro, Franz Philipp, Saiyid Rizvi, Oskar Spate and Judith Wright) and one Honorary Fellow (J. C. Beaglehole) were elected by the fifty-one Foundation Fellows at a Special General Meeting on 20‚Äì21 September 1969. Annual elections have taken place since that time. For an account of the debates and efforts that led to the establishment of the Academy, see Graeme Davison FAHA's article in the inaugural edition of Humanities Australia: 'Phoenix Rising: The Academy and the Humanities in 1969'.  Governance  The Academy is governed by a Council of leaders in the humanities, elected from among its Fellows, who provide strategic direction, policy guidance, and management oversight. The Council meets four times a year. A Canberra-based Secretariat is responsible for the day-to-day running of the Academy. = Council in 2020 = President: Professor Joy Damousi FASSA FAHA (elected November 2017) Vice-President & Honorary Secretary: Emeritus Professor Elizabeth Minchin FAHA Vice-President & International Secretary: Professor Louise Edwards FHKHA FAHA Honorary Treasurer: Emeritus Professor Richard Waterhouse FRSN FASSA FAHA Editor: Emeritus Professor Graham Tulloch FAHA Immediate Past President: Professor John Fitzgerald FAHA Members: Professor Duncan Ivison FRSN FAHA, Professor Lesley Head FASSA FAHA, Professor Jennifer Milam FAHA, Professor Julian Thomas FAHA and Professor Sean Ulm FSA MAACAI FAHA.

S. Eliot's 1939 Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. Primarily a dance role with no solo singing parts, playing Victoria demands extensive ballet training and a high degree of flexibility. The character is featured in a ballet solo (\\"White Cat Solo\\") as well as a pas de deux in the musical, and leads most of the ensemble dance routines. The role was originated by Finola Hughes in the West End in 1981, and by Cynthia Onrubia on Broadway in 1982. In the 2019 movie adaptation, the role is played by Francesca Hayward. Unlike her stage counterpart, this version is made the de facto protagonist of the film and has more of a singing role. She performs the film's sole new song \\"Beautiful Ghosts\\", as well as taking over Jemima's part in \\"Memory\\". Character description Within the Jellicle tribe, Victoria is a naive and shy white kitten who is known for her beauty and poise. She is a very quiet cat and has no solo singing parts; however, she is frequently spotlighted as a dancer and opens with a ballet solo near the beginning of the musical. Dance Magazine described her \\"iconic\\" solo as \\"filled with endless d√©velopp√©s punctuated by twitches and swerves, ending in a Pilates-teaser‚Äìlike seat.\\" According to Cats choreographer Gillian Lynne, the \\"White Cat Solo\\" represents the character's coming of age. After her solo, Victoria's dancing continues to feature heavily throughout the show; she leads most of the group numbers and takes part in a ceremonial mating dance (pas de deux) with Plato. At the end of the musical, Victoria becomes the second cat ‚Äî after Jemima ‚Äî to fully accept the outcast Grizabella, which leads to Grizabella's re-acceptance by the Jellicles and ascension to the Heaviside Layer. Appearance Victoria is known for her distinct white coat, which stands out among the multi-coloured markings of the other cats. Her white coat is meant to symbolise the character's innocence. Although her costume is designed to give the impression of a pure-white cat, due to the limitations of stage lighting (a pure white costume would wash out all costume details under stage lighting), she has light gold, tan, or grey markings on her costume. Her distinct appearance also makes her a frequent subject for advertising for the musical. She also wears a pink bejeweled collar around her neck in the stage musical. Notable casting The role of Victoria was originated by Finola Hughes in the original West End production in 1981, and by Cynthia Onrubia in the original Broadway production in 1982. The character was played by Georgina Pazcoguin in the 2016 Broadway revival. On screen, Phyllida Crowley Smith portrayed Victoria in the 1998 filmed version of the musical, and Francesca Hayward portrayed the character in the 2019 film adaption.

It is located on in the valley of the Helmand River at altitude, to the north-east of Lashkargah. Sangin is notorious as one of the central locations of the opium trade in the south of the country, and is also a town that has traditionally supported the Taliban.Geopium - Jane's Intelligence Review - Opiate smuggling routes from Afghanistan to Europe and Asia It was described by British newspaper The Guardian as \\"the deadliest area in Afghanistan\\" in 2010. Sangin also houses the main bazaar for Sangin District. Route 611 passes through Sangin. Climate Sangin has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen BWh), characterised by little precipitation and high variation between summer and winter temperatures. The average temperature in Sangin is 18.8 ¬∞C, while the annual precipitation averages 143 mm. July is the hottest month of the year with an average temperature of 31.6 ¬∞C. The coldest month January has an average temperature of 6.1 ¬∞C.  International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) operations  =2005= On 31 July 2005 a United Nations convoy of six vehicles came under attack by Taliban forces lying in ambush some 2 km south of the town. All personnel including the international UN staff member managed to escape by reversing their route only to come under fire by a United States Army patrol of Humvee vehicles that were advancing to the location of the fire fight. Two Afghan personnel, one driver and the armed guard commander from the Ministry of Interior, were wounded by the friendly fire and evacuated by helicopter to Kandahar. The armored vehicle that the UN worker was traveling in was unable to be driven due to being hit with approximately fifteen rounds of fire including two rounds from a .50 caliber machine gun. The retreating Taliban were identified crossing the nearby river some 1,500 meters to the west and were killed by a single 500 lb bomb delivered by air support from a United States Air Force (USAF) Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber. =2006= In March 2006 units of the 3/124th Infantry American Security Force (SECFOR) teams and their Afghan counterparts began the construction of FOB Wolf on a plateau over looking the Sangin green zone. The base immediately became a target for the local militants and poppy growers. FOB Wolf would soon be renamed FOB Robinson in honor of Staff Sergeant Christopher L. Robinson, 36, of Brandon, Mississippi. Robinson was killed while on mission Carpe Diem with the 20th Special Forces group in the valley center. Later in March, a resupply convoy from 1/124th IN SECFOR was sent to FOB Wolf. The convoy was involved in a complex ambush that lasted about an hour resulting in 8‚Äì10 enemy killed, and no friendly forces lost. After regrouping the convoy an Afghan National Army (ANA) vehicle struck an improvised explosive device (IED) killing six Afghans outside of Hyderabad, Gerishk District, Helmand province, Afghanistan. After clearing the scene and recovering the ANA KIA, the convoy continued to FOB Wolf under aerial support from Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. Later that night a large group of militants attacked the FOB where once again Soldiers from the 1/124th and personnel assigned to FOB Wolf returned fire. However, during the melee that followed, American Sergeant first class John Thomas Stone and Pte. Robert Costall, a Canadian soldier, were killed in action. After a lengthy investigation it was found that both soldiers were killed by friendly fire from an American machine gun which fired across the camp hitting both Soldiers who were on a roof top position over the TOC. In April the unit was relieved by another SECFOR team from the 207th RCAG from Shindand. The actions of this unit can be seen by reading \\"The Poor Bastard's Club\\" book written by SSG Paul Mehlos.https://www.amazon.com/The-Poor-Bastards-Club- Afghanistan/dp/1453720456. On June 2, 2006, the base and all its contents were signed over to the British 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment (3 PARA). After being warned against the \\"platoon house\\" strategy, the British became engaged in heavy fighting with Taliban insurgents and allied opium traffickers deep inside the green zone. A number of British and Canadian troops were killed during fighting in the town, including Corporal Bryan Budd (3 PARA) who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. =2008= In 2008 without the support of a Marine Air-Ground Task Force, members of Echo Company, 2nd Battalion 7th Marines, were sent to Sangin to assist Ranger Company, 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment, who were stationed in central Sangin's FOB Jackson as part of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment (2 PARA)'s deployment. Within a month of their arrival, 3rd Platoon had branched out from FOB Tangiers and established FOB Wishtan. From June to October 2008 Echo company suffered numerous casualties, to include Cpl. Richard Weinmaster, who despite grievous wounds continued to fight until losing consciousness. His actions on that day earned him a Navy Cross, one of two that 2nd Battalion 7th Marines awarded during their deployment in Afghanistan. On August 14, 2008 two separate IED attacks within a few hundred meters and twenty minutes of one another claimed the lives of Lance Corporal Jacob Tovez, Corporal Anthony Mihalo, and Lance Corporal Juan Lopez-Castenaeda. In October 2008 Echo Company pulled out of Sangin, after handing FOB Tangiers and FOB Wishtan back over to the British. 2nd Battalion 7th Marines received a Navy Unit Commendation for their actions in Afghanistan. =2010= In June 2010, 3rd Battalion 7th Marines and 3rd Combat Engineer Battalion entered Sangin to aid British forces and eventually take over. 3/7 flooded the green zone with Marines and 3rd Combat Engineer Battalion Provided Assault Breacher Vehicles upon arrival and controlled areas from Route 611 to the Helmand River in a months time. In September 2010, Liam Fox, the United Kingdom's Secretary of State for Defence, announced that northern Helmand would be transferred to the United States Marine Corps (USMC). A third of all British deaths in Afghanistan, (approximately 100), occurred over four years of occupation in Sangin.UK troops leave Helmand's Sangin. BBC News, 2010-09-20. The British troops, with 40 Commando, Royal Marines among the last to leave the area, withdrew on September 20, 2010 to be replaced by 3/7. 3/7 was replaced by 3rd Battalion 5th Marines in early October 2010 and operated between September 2010 and April 2011. In November 2010, 3/25 kilo company was ordered into Sangin as additional reinforcements were needed and attached to 3/5. Also attached to 3/5 was Echo Company 2/9, who arrived to aid 3/5 due to the number of casualties that unit had sustained. They were there from December 2010 until February 2011. 3/5 cleared and secured Sangin's \\"Brown Zone\\" and much of the \\"Green Zone,\\" while Echo 2/9 was in command of other parts the southern \\"Green Zone.\\" Echo 2/9 sustained three KIA during their time in Sangin. 2/9 was relieved by Echo Company, 2D Battalion 8th Marines in February 2011 taking over a portion of the Southern Green Zone. Twenty-five members of 3rd battalion 5th Marines were killed in action, including the son of Lt. Gen. John F. Kelly, head of the Marine Corps Reserve, and 174 were wounded, many losing limbs. In 520 firefights the battalion killed or wounded an estimated 470 enemy fighters and cleared the Sangin area of the enemy.Kovach, Gretel C., \\"Pendleton Marines Turn The Tide In The 'Fallujah Of Afghanistan'\\", San Diego Union-Tribune, 24 April 2011.3rd Battalion, 5th Marines official website iCasualties  OEF  Afghanistan  Fatalities DetailsThree Star Marine General's Son Killed in Afghanistan - ABC NewsPerry, Tony, \\"A Battalion's Mounting Loss\\", Los Angeles Times, 23 January 2011, p. 1.Perry, Tony, \\"Tears Are Mixed With Pride At Camp Pendleton Memorial For Fallen Marines\\", Los Angeles Times, 30 April 2011. =2011= Echo Company 2nd Battalion 9th Marines, \\"The Greenhats\\", were re-deployed from Marjah in support of 3/5 from Jan-Feb 2011. 3/5 was relieved by 1st Battalion 5th Marines in March 2011, and 1/5 remained there until October 2011 with help from Echo 2/8 who was there since January 2011 until mid August 2011 when they were relieved by Bravo Company 1/6 for a short duration. 17 marines from 1st Battalion 5th Marines were killed by IEDs and small-arms fire, 191 were wounded.https://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/05/local/la-me-marines- memorial-20111105 1/5 was relieved by 3rd Battalion 7th Marines, who once more returned to Sangin focusing on training the Afghan National Army (ANA) unit there, 3rd Tolai, 2nd Kandak, 2nd Brigade, 215th Corps, and saw positive results. The ANA began to take ownership of many patrol bases, and regularly patrolled the city autonomously. They began to rely on each other and the local villagers to complete day to day missions more than they had at any time previously. The civilians use a tip line to inform the ANA of IEDs in the area, which the ANA interdicts. The ANA soldiers buy food and goods from the locals, strengthening the relationship of the Afghans with their army.Sgt harrer, Jacob H., \\"Afghan soldiers run patrol base, secure local area\\", . 22 February 2012. the Marines continue to encourage this cooperative attitude between the Afghan National Army, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and the People of Sangin. =2012= 1/7 Deployed to Sangin in March 2012-October 2012.

Jurkat cells can produce interleukin 2, and are used in research involving the susceptibility of cancers to drugs and radiation. History The Jurkat cell line (originally called JM) was established in the late 1970s from the peripheral blood of a 14-year-old boy with T cell leukemia. Different derivatives of the Jurkat cell line that have been mutated to lack certain genes can now be obtained from cell culture banks.American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Examples of derivatives The JCaM1.6 cell line is deficient in Lck activity due to the deletion of part of the LCK gene (exon 7) from the LCK transcript. * J.RT3-T3.5 cells have a mutation in the T cell receptor beta chain locus precluding expression of this chain. This affects the cells in several ways; they do not express surface CD3 or produce the T cell receptor alpha/beta heterodimer. Since they are deficient in the TCR complex, these cells are a useful tool for transfection studies using T cell receptor alpha and beta chain genes and are widely used in labs in which T cell receptor gene transfer technologies are studied. * The I 9.2 and I 2.1 cell lines. The I 2.1 cell line is functionally defective for FADD and the I 9.2 cell line is functionally defective for caspase-8, both defective molecules being essential to apoptosis or necroptosis of cells. * The D1.1 cell line does not express the CD4 molecule, an important co-receptor in the activation pathway of helper T cells. * The J.gamma1 subline contains no detectable phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-Œ≥1) protein and therefore has profound defects in T cell receptor (TCR) calcium mobilization and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT, an important transcription factor in T cells). * J-Lat contains integrated but transcriptionally latent HIV proviruses, in which GFP replaces nef coding sequence, and a frameshift mutation in env.

It runs in an east‚Äìwest direction from the Texas state line southwest of Vivian to a junction with U.S. Highway 65 (US 65) near Lake Providence, just west of the Mississippi state line. It is the northernmost cross-state highway in Louisiana and runs between Interstate 20 (I-20) and the Arkansas state line for its entire distance. LA 2 spans nine parishes, connecting five parish seats with direct connections to the remaining four, traveling through Homer, Bastrop, and smaller communities such as Hosston, Plain Dealing, Sarepta, Bernice, Farmerville, Mer Rouge, and Oak Grove. LA 2 also has intersections with many of the state's major north‚Äìsouth routes, such as LA 1, US 71, US 371, US 167, US 165, and at its eastern terminus, US 65\\\\. An interchange with the newly constructed extension of I-49 was scheduled to be completed in Spring 2013 and opened to traffic later in the year. Route description =Texas state line to Homer= From the west, LA 2 begins at the Texas state line, continuing the route of Texas State Highway 49 (SH 49) into northern Caddo Parish, Louisiana. LA 2 proceeds east as an undivided two-lane highway through the community of Trees then curves to the northeast and back to the east around the tip of Caddo Lake to intersect LA 1 at a point north of Oil City. LA 2 turns north, running concurrent with LA 1 along the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) tracks into Vivian. The highway widens to accommodate a center turning lane at Rebel Road. LA 2 then turns northeast onto Camp Road while LA 1 continues northward. Returning to two-lane capacity, LA 2 is now joined by LA 170 which follows LA 1 through much of Vivian. After two blocks, LA 170 turns south onto South Pardue Street while LA 2 turns north and then east out of town. After , LA 2 enters Hosston, where it intersects US 71, which heads through Ida into Arkansas on the north and to Shreveport on the south. From this junction, LA 2 turns north onto US 71 briefly before resuming its eastward course. outside of Hosston, LA 2 crosses a bridge over the Red River and into Bossier Parish. In Bossier Parish, LA 2 intersects LA 537 and continues east for another into Plain Dealing. LA 2 follows Mary Lee Street through town and intersects LA 3 (Louisiana Street), which also connects to Shreveport. Proceeding east from this intersection, LA 2 widens to an undivided four-lane highway. It then crosses the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) tracks and shortly thereafter intersects LA 157 (North Magnolia Street), which takes a northeastern course toward Springhill. LA 157 joins LA 2 eastward out of Plain Dealing, narrowing again to two lanes, before turning south toward Rocky Mount. LA 2 continues due east for before intersecting LA 529 (Emma Cemetery Road). Soon after this intersection, LA 2 crosses Bodcau Bayou into Webster Parish. In Webster Parish, LA 2 enters Sarepta and intersects US 371, which heads north into Cullen and Springhill and south into Minden. After crossing this intersection, LA 2 immediately turns north onto South Main Street, running parallel to US 371 briefly before turning to the northeast. LA 2 is also signed from this point directly west to US 371, allowing drivers from either direction to bypass the short Main Street segment in favor of US 371\\\\. (This connector is officially LA 2 Spur). At a point northeast of Sarepta, LA 2 intersects LA 802, which travels northwest to US 371 at Porterville and Bunker. LA 2 then dips slightly to the south and crosses Bayou Dorcheat at a point known as Sykes Ferry. It then curves back to the northeast toward Shongaloo where it intersects LA 159\\\\. Here LA 2 Alternate begins and runs eastward through Haynesville, eventually meeting back up with LA 2 in Bernice. Meanwhile, LA 2 turns southward and runs concurrent with LA 159 to a point known as Leton. At an intersection with LA 160, which heads west to Cotton Valley, LA 159 continues southward to Minden while LA 2 turns to the southeast. Before crossing into Claiborne Parish, LA 2 intersects LA 521, which heads north to Millerton near the Arkansas state line. After crossing the parish line, LA 2 intersects LA 534 Spur at a point known as Blackburn. After , LA 2 intersects LA 534 itself, which heads north toward Haynesville and south toward Minden. Curving due east, LA 2 intersects LA 3062 which splits off to the southeast into downtown Homer, the parish seat, while LA 2 slightly bypasses the town to the north. Nearing the northwest corner of Homer, LA 2 intersects and begins a concurrency with US 79 Byp., a western bypass of the town that is also designated as the LA 9 truck route. Just after this intersection, the three concurrent highways intersect LA 540, another route into Homer. After crossing the Louisiana and North West (LNW) short-line railroad, the highways intersect US 79\\\\. From this intersection, US 79 heads north to Haynesville and southwest through Homer to Minden; US 79 Byp. ends, having reached its parent route; and LA 2 and LA 9 Truck continue eastward out of Homer. =Homer to Bastrop= Just east of Homer, LA 2 intersects LA 9, ending the concurrency with LA 9 Truck. LA 9 heads northeast through Summerfield to Junction City and south through Homer to points such as Athens and Arcadia. LA 2 continues due east past the northern end of Lake Claiborne then intersects LA 806, which travels through a point known as Arizona. After , LA 2 intersects LA 518 in Lisbon. LA 518 provides a connection to Lake Claiborne State Park at Aycock to the south. Before exiting Claiborne Parish, LA 2 intersects LA 152, which splits off to the southeast toward Dubach. LA 2 crosses into Union Parish and continues east, entering Bernice on 8th Street. It then intersects US 63/US 167, which runs northbound along Cherry Street toward Junction City and southbound along Plum Street toward Ruston. LA 2 turns north for four blocks, running briefly concurrent with US 63/US 167, to 4th Street where it meets the eastern terminus of LA 2 Alt. LA 2 then turns east, narrowing again to two lanes, and follows 4th Street out of Bernice. outside the town limit, LA 2 intersects LA 550, after which it curves to the southeast through Shiloh. LA 2 then continues in a general eastward direction for before making the first of several crossings over parts of Bayou D'Arbonne Lake. Shortly afterward, LA 2 enters the town of Farmerville, the parish seat. Here it turns south onto North Main Street, running concurrent with LA 15\\\\. One block later at Miller Street, LA 33 is added to the concurrency, having entered from the direction of Marion to the northeast. After passing through the center of town, LA 2 turns east onto East Water Street, gaining a center turning lane, while LA 15/LA 33 continues southward across Bayou D'Arbonne Lake toward Monroe and Ruston, respectively. At Holder Road, the center lane disappears, and LA 2 becomes an undivided two-lane highway again. east of the Farmerville city limits, LA 2 intersects LA 828 then turns to the southeast, intersecting LA 143 at a point known as Crossroads. LA 143 connects to Monroe on the south. LA 2 and LA 143 begin a concurrency that lasts for , crossing Bayou De Loutre and turning back to the east, until reaching a point just south of Spencer where LA 143 turns north toward Marion. LA 2 then curves back to the southeast and crosses the Ouachita River into the town of Sterlington in Ouachita Parish. In Sterlington, LA 2 intersects LA 553 which follows the Ouachita River southward. On the southeast end of town, LA 2 intersects US 165 north of Monroe. LA 2 turns north, running concurrent with the divided four- lane US 165, and crosses from Ouachita Parish into Morehouse Parish. On the parish line, at a point known as Perryville, US 165 and LA 2 intersect LA 554, which heads east to Collinston. The two highways continue to the northeast, roughly parallel to Bayou Bartholomew, for (becoming an un-divided four-lane highway at Henry Avenue) to Point Pleasant and an intersection with LA 592 (Point Pleasant Road). US 165/LA 2 then curves to the east and enters the city of Bastrop. =Bastrop to eastern terminus= US 165 and LA 2 enter Bastrop on Madison Avenue. As they approach the center of town, eastbound traffic continues east on Madison while westbound traffic follows parallel Jefferson Avenue. At the city's main junction, US 165 and LA 2 intersect US 425, LA 139, and LA 593 which travel northbound on Franklin Street and southbound on Washington Street. At this junction of five highways, US 425 and LA 593 continue north toward the Arkansas state line; LA 139 begins and heads south into Monroe; LA 593 heads south into Collinston; and US 165 and LA 2 are joined by US 425 eastward out of town. At an intersection with LA 830-5 (Elm Street), the median gives way to a center turning lane. Several other minor state routes are encountered on the east side of Bastrop: LA 830-6 (McCreight Street), LA 830-4 (Cooper Lake Road), LA 3051 (Grabault Road), and LA 830-3 (Peach Orchard Road). At the intersection with LA 3051, the highway narrows again to two lanes. past the intersection with LA 830-3, the three concurrent highways enter the village of Mer Rouge on Davenport Avenue, its main street. Beginning at 18th Street, a median divides the street's two lanes. Reaching the village's main junction, which lies on either side of the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, US 165 turns northward toward Bonita and into Arkansas; US 425 turns south toward points such as Oak Ridge and Rayville; LA 138 begins and heads south toward Collinston; and LA 2 continues on its own as an undivided two-lane highway. After running due east for a distance of , LA 2 crosses the Boeuf River into West Carroll Parish. After crossing the parish line, LA 2 turns to the northeast and intersects LA 585 at Goodwill. After , LA 2 intersects LA 582 at Redwing. LA 582 heads eastward through Forest. Several more minor routes are encountered on the way into Oak Grove, the parish seat: LA 878, LA 597, LA 587, and LA 879\\\\. LA 2 follows Main Street through Oak Grove, gaining a center turning lane, and intersects LA 17 (Constitution Avenue), which heads northward to Kilbourne and southward eventually to Delhi on I-20. Continuing east from LA 17, the center turn lane disappears, and LA 2 returns to an undivided two-lane highway for the remainder of its route. Just east of Oak Grove, LA 2 intersects LA 589, another route into Forest, then crosses Bayou Macon into East Carroll Parish. LA 2 travels east for a final before reaching its eastern terminus, US 65, at Highland, a point just north of Lake Providence. =Byway designation= Nearly the entire route of LA 2 west of Lisbon constitutes the main path of the Boom or Bust Byway in the state-designated system of tourist routes known as the Louisiana Scenic Byways. View of Lake Providence across US 65 from the east end of LA 2 History =Pre-1955 route numbering= In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 2 made up parts of several routes, including State Route 202 from the western terminus at the Texas state line to the intersection with the modern LA 1 south of Vivian; State Route 8 to Vivian; State Route 109 to Plain Dealing; State Route 70 to Shongaloo; State Route 66 to Leton; State Route 490 to Homer; State Route 11 to Lisbon; State Route 489 to Bernice; State Route 11 again to Farmerville; State Route 815 to the intersection with the modern LA 143 west of Sterlington; and State Route 11 once again to the eastern terminus north of Lake Providence. =Alignment changes since 1955= LA 2 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, and its route has seen two significant alignment changes‚Äîthe bypassing of Homer and a re-routing through Webster Parish‚Äîand a series of other improvements. LA 2 originally followed LA 3062 into downtown Homer. Upon reaching the intersection with US 79 and LA 9 at the courthouse square, LA 2 continued east out of town co-signed with LA 9. The current alignment bypassing Homer to the north was opened in 1964, eliminating the concurrency with LA 9 and creating LA 3062 along the remainder of the bypassed route. The other major alignment change shifted much of the route through Webster Parish. From the Bayou Dorcheat bridge at Sykes Ferry (the original western terminus of LA 2 Alt.), LA 2 turned southeast onto Fire Tower Road to LA 160\\\\. It then followed current LA 160 and Leton Cutoff Road to Leton. Here it turned south onto current LA 159 and east onto Pistol Thomas Road, rejoining the current alignment just west of Blackburn. LA 2 assumed its current alignment between Sykes Ferry and Leton in the early 1970s following what was previously LA 2 Alt. to Shongaloo and co-signed with LA 159 to Leton. The western terminus of LA 2 Alt. was then truncated to its current location at Shongaloo. Other alignment changes have included the creation of a one-way pair through Bastrop around 1969 with Madison Avenue converted to carry westbound traffic only and Jefferson Avenue added to carry eastbound traffic; the slight relocation of the intersection with US 165 at Sterlington around 1982 (Waterside Drive northeast of Old Sterlington Road is a remnant of the original connection); the streamlining of the junction at Leton about the same time; the shift onto a new bridge over Bayou Dorcheat at Sykes Ferry around 1984; and the re-routing onto a parallel street through Plain Dealing (LA 2 originally followed Palmetto Street east of LA 3). More minor alignment changes resulted from the smoothing of several curves along the route, mostly in Claiborne and Union parishes. Remnants of the original route exist today as short sections of local roads such as Old Homer Road near Blackburn, Old Lisbon Road at LA 806, Rocky Springs Road at LA 518, and Ben Lowery Road east of Shiloh. More recent alterations have included: a change of connector in Vivian, slightly shortening the route by following Camp Road instead of East Arkansas Avenue; the widening of US 63/US 167 to four lanes through Bernice, much of which is concurrent with LA 2, by converting Cherry Street to carry northbound traffic only and parallel Plum Street added to carry southbound traffic; and lastly, the construction of a high-level bridge over the Ouachita River slightly shifted the alignment at Sterlington. The new bridge, opened in July 2009, replaced the original swing bridge completed in 1932 during the administration of Governor Huey P. Long. The original bridge existed just to the south of the current span and has been demolished, but the approach roads still exist. The approach on the Union Parish side is now a local road while that on the Ouachita Parish side is now an extension of LA 553 as the height of the new bridge prevents LA 2 and LA 553 to intersect at the original location. Future Construction is currently underway by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) to extend I-49 north from Shreveport to the Arkansas state line parallel to US 71, a project scheduled for completion in 2016. An interchange with LA 2 has been constructed east of Hosston and is set to open in Summer 2013 along with all but the southernmost portion of the project on the northwest side of Shreveport. Major intersections Special routes =Shongaloo‚ÄìBernice alternate route= Louisiana Highway 2 Alternate (LA 2 Alt.) runs in an east‚Äìwest direction from Shongaloo to Bernice, connecting to LA 2 at either end. LA 2 Alt. parallels the route of LA 2 to the north, traveling through the town of Haynesville where it intersects US 79\\\\. LA 2 Alt. is an anomaly in the current state highway system, being the only special state route designated in the 1955 renumbering and the only \\"Alternate\\" state route. Its route has seen only one major change, the relocation of its western terminus from Sykes Ferry to Shongaloo in the early 1970s. The intervening route was assumed by LA 2, which was re-routed through Webster Parish at this time, shortening LA 2 Alt. by . =Sarepta spur route= Louisiana Highway 2 Spur (LA 2 Spur) provides a direct connection between westbound LA 2 and northbound US 371 in Sarepta. From the east, as LA 2 turns south onto Main Street, LA 2 Spur continues straight ahead to US 371, a distance of on an undivided two-lane roadway. LA 2 Spur also allows LA 2 traffic from either direction to bypass the brief section of the route running along Main Street in favor of the parallel US 371\\\\. This is facilitated by the route being signed simply as LA 2 with directional markers at US 371 leading back to the actual LA 2. LA 2 Spur was created around 1959 when LA 7 (now US 371), formerly concurrent with LA 2 along Main Street, was shifted onto a parallel alignment through Sarepta.

In 879, John excommunicated Athanasius, for the latter had not yet broken with the Moslems.Byzantine Italy: c.680-c.876, T.S. Brown, The New Cambridge Medieval History: c.500-c.700, Vol. II, ed. Rosamond McKitterick, (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 342. He was instead involving himself in the wars over the throne of Capua. He assisted Atenulf against his brothers and cousins. With Byzantine troops, he besieged Capua itself. From about 881, he himself ruled Capua, technically a vassal of Prince Guaimar I of Salerno. He and Guaimar fought an indecisive war while the latter was preoccupied with the Saracen menace Athanasius was ignoring. In 886, Athanasius, since released from excommunication, was allied with the Saracens again and received a threat from Pope Stephen V of a blockade of Naples. By 887, Atenulf was installed in Capua as count. In 888, Athanasius and Atenulf disputed the region of \\"Liburnia\\" and went to war. They fought an indecisive battle at S. Carzio on the Clanio. In 895, Athanasius fomented a revolt of the Neapolitan populace in the city of Salerno. However, Guaimar's young son, Guaimar II, put it down. Domestically, Athanasius increased the power and prestige of Naples. He was a hellenophile who worked to preserve many Greek manuscripts and maintain good relations with Byzantium. He had a daughter, Gemma, who married Landulf I of Benevento, son of his former ally Atenulf. He was succeeded as duke by his nephew Gregory IV and as bishop by his brother Stephen.

Her work is an expression of her concern about environment and ethics, her \\"\\"ecological quest\\" as she produces art that allows the viewer to immerse themselves to strive for a deeper connection with the natural world.. Her work has been included in major survey exhibitions, nationally and internationally and is regularly exhibited in Australia, Japan, Germany, Hong Kong and the UK. She has exhibited in galleries and outside in site-specific projects, often involving collaborations with architects, landscape architects and environmental scientists. Her work is held in all major Australian galleries as well as private collections in Australia and overseas. Biography Laurence was born in 1947 in Sydney, Australia, where she continues to live and work. 1977‚Äì79 Laurence studied in Sydney and Italy. 1979 - 81 Laurence lived in New York City to pursue graduate studies. She was influenced by a Joseph Beuys exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum, and discovered the Earth or Land artists. She was particularly struck by f Alan Sonfist‚Äôs permanent installation Time Landscape (1965‚Äì)  a garden presented as a work of art. 1981 Laurence had a 3-month residency at Bennington College in the woods of Vermont. While there she was influenced by the movement to consider and view art outside the traditional gallery walls. 1982 She returned to Sydney and continued studying at the City Art Institute, part of the University of New South Wales. 1983 She completed a Graduate Diploma in Professional Art Studies at the University of New South Wales. 1994 Laurence completed a Master of Fine Arts at the University of New South Wales. Laurence has been a recipient of a Australia Council Fellowship (1996-98) and Churchill Fellowship (2006). 1995 - 2005 She was a Trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales 2007 Laurence was the subject of John Beard's winning entry for the Archibald Prize sponsored by the Art Gallery of New South Whales.http://www.thearchibaldprize.com.au/winners/archibald The portrait features Laurence in a moment of reflection, captured in black and white, but textured with light and shade. The pair are close friends and the collaboration lends itself to a sense of double portraiture with the artist- as-subject. 2007 - 2009 She served on the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council Since 2008 Laurence has been a Visiting Fellow at the College of Fine Arts, University of New South Wales She is also a council member of Voiceless, the animal protection institute.  Work  Lawrence has made small works, but increasingly she has focused on large, outside works that are described as immersive, and use such natural materials as minerals and oxides, living plant matter, corals, taxidermy birds, and more. She is cited as stating that the acceptance of installation art in Australia began in 1991 when she was commissioned to create the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the Canberra War Memorial. The work, created in conjunction with the architectural firm Tonkin Zulaikha, consists of four pillars of different materials that soar upward in the hall of memories. Her focus on science began in 1990 when she began to use metascience to better understand the ideas about transient and transformative nature. In the early 2000s her work became increasingly political as well as poetic, as she intentionally began to focus on the triangle of artist, artwork and viewer. The viewer increasing became part of the artwork as they could look through and walk through installations. Major commissioned works include: Australian War Memorial, London (in collaboration with TZG Architects) Tarkine for a World in Need of Wilderness Macquarie Bank London. The Tarkine is a wilderness area in Tasmania, Australia that is a World Heritage Site. In the Shadow, Sydney 2000 Olympic Park, an installation along a creek of various rods to symbolize water testing. On her own website, Janet explains: > The work aims to reveal the transforming chemistry of water remediation by > creating a poetic alchemical zone as a metaphor for the actual > transformation of Homebush Bay from its degraded contaminated industrial > past into a green and living site for the future. \\"The installation is > designed to be informative with regard to the environmental history of the > site, but also to be \\"a quiet place, a place of contemplation.\\" Waterveil, CH2 Building for Melbourne City Council. The work is made up of tall vertical panels of glass, some of which are screen printed with images of glass vessels, some slightly colored to look like fluid running through them. They are on outside windows of the building foyer, and so can be seen both outside and inside. Elixir, Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennial, Japan; This is a wooden traditional Japanese house that incorporates a glass panel screen printed with poured paint. as well as plant and fluids, blown-glass vials, plant extracts steeped in shochu, and laboratory glass. It is a permanent installation. Memory of Lived Spaces, T3 Terminal Changi Singapore. This work blends architecture with nature. Photographic panels are overlaid with painted sheets of glass. Laurence was the Australian representative to the United Nation‚Äôs Convention on Climate Change in late 2015. Her work, Deep Breathing Resuscitation for the Reef (Australia Museum) focused on the fragility of the Great Barrier Reef  a World Heritage Site  because of climate change. The critically acclaimed installation used pigment as well as acrylic boxes and laboratory glass to enclose wet specimens and coral . On her view of works on site, she has said: > \\"The offering of nature is so important because when an artist creates it, > there is more significance than when a landscape company does it. It draws > your attention to it, and the work becomes much more than merely a > landscape\\". On being a woman artist, she has said,  Collections  Laurence‚Äôs works are held in a number of collections including Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; Australian War Memorial, Canberra; Museum Kunstwerk, Eberdingen, Germany; Museum of Contemporary Art Australia, National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne; Queensland Art Gallery  Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane; Seibu Collection, Tokyo; World Bank Collection, Washington DC; University of New South Wales, Sydney; University of Western Australia, Perth.

In this role it has been replaced by the Western standard gauge line. Services Metro Trains Melbourne operates suburban passenger train services along the inner section of the line as far as Sunshine on the Sunbury Line, while V/Line services operate as the Interurban Ballarat Line and the Intercity Ararat Line. During peak hour some services originate and terminate at Bacchus Marsh. Passengers on the inner section of the line to Melton are permitted to use Myki tickets to access the services, with this section marked as the Melton line on suburban network maps. Beyond Ararat the line is part of the Western standard gauge line and sees The Overland to Adelaide. Freight services also use the line between Ballarat and Melbourne, coming off the Mildura line. The Western standard gauge also sees a large number of interstate freight trains as part of the Melbourne‚ÄìAdelaide railway. On 16 July 2014, the Serviceton railway line ceased calling at North Melbourne station due to the Regional Rail Link and separation of tracks between Melbourne metropolitan and Regional trains. In January 2017 Caroline Springs station opened. History Serviceton railway station on the state border The first railway line from Melbourne to Ballarat was via Geelong. Construction of the Geelong-Ballarat line began in 1858 and took nearly four years to complete. The project employed 3,000 men and cost approximately 1.5 million pounds. The line officially opened in 1862, with the first train running on 10 April‚Äîat a rate of 15 miles per hour‚Äîtaking around four and a half hours to reach Geelong, amid various complications, including the inability to pull up a hill and the lack of firewood. The return trip commenced at 12:20 pm, arriving in Ballarat at 3 pm. The line was extended from Ballarat to Beaufort in 1874 and to Ararat in 1875. It took until 1889 for a direct line from Melbourne to Ballarat to be opened, in part due to the difficult terrain between Bacchus Marsh and Ballan. Up until 1995 the line through Ballarat was the main route for freight trains between Melbourne and Adelaide, as well as The Overland services to Adelaide, and V/Line services to Horsham and Dimboola. V/Line passenger rail services beyond Ballarat were withdrawn on 27 May 1994,VictorianRailways.net ‚Äì VR Timeline and in 1995 the One Nation Program rerouted the main interstate line via North Shore and Maroona and the broad gauge line between Ballarat and Ararat was closed to all traffic. The broad gauge passenger service from Ballarat to Ararat was not reinstated until 2004. Work began in 2005 on upgrades between Sunshine and Ballarat as part of the Regional Fast Rail project, which saw heavier tracks and concrete sleepers installed, renewal of ballast and a new signalling system. A number of deviations were built to ease curves on the line, as well as seven new bridges, with the Lal Lal Creek and Moorabool River bridges amongst the longest in Australia. The works were completed and the first VLocity train ran on the line on 22 December 2005.V/Line ‚Äì First Day of VLocity Revenue Operation (Ballarat) As part of the Transit Cities program, a new station was opened at Wendouree on 14 June 2009. In June 2008 Pacific National and grain handler GrainCorp announced they would cease rail freight operations on the Yaapeet to Dimboola line. The decision was based on the Rail Freight Network Review chaired by former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, which placed the Yaapeet line at the lowest level of investment priority. As a result, farmers at Rainbow, Jeparit and Yaapeet must truck their grain to GrainCorp's Warracknabeal grain centre instead of the Rainbow depot. A local council attacked the plan as it would result in the need to upgrade roads in the area.  Branch lines and extensions  V/Line VLocity train at the junction with the Melbourne-Ballarat line at Warrenheip station Ballarat station = Ballarat region = A branch line was built from Ballarat to Newtown and Skipton in 1883. This line closed in 1985. A branch was built between Newtown, Cressy and Irrewarra (east of Colac) about 1910. This line was closed in 1953. A branch line was built from Linton junction to the Ballarat Cattle Yards and Redan in 1886. This line was closed in 1997. =Ararat and western branches= Horsham-Carpolac rail ticket 1978 The line was extended from Ballarat to Beaufort in 1874 and Ararat in 1875, Stawell in 1876, Murtoa in 1878, Horsham in 1882, Dimboola in 1882 and linked with the South Australian Railways at Serviceton in 1887. Until 1993, two daily broad gauge V/Line trains ran from Melbourne to Dimboola as well as the nightly The Overland service from Melbourne to Adelaide. Under the Kennett Government's economic reforms, the V/Line train service was then cut back to Ararat. The Ballarat to Ararat section was closed in 1994 with gauge standardisation of the line, which made reinstatement of a V/Line service beyond Ararat virtually impossible. The Overland service was re-routed via Maroona after the works were complete, while the broad gauge passenger service from Ballarat to Ararat was not reinstated until 2004. A branch line was built from Lubeck (between Stawell and Murtoa) to Rupanyup in 1887, extended to Marnoo by 1909, and to Bolangum in the 1927. It closed in 1983. A branch line was opened from Murtoa to Warracknabeal in 1886 and extended to Beulah in 1893, Roseberry and Hopetoun in 1894 and Patchewollock in 1927. The section from Hopetoun to Patchewollock was closed in the 1980s. The line from Murtoa to Hopetoun was converted to standard gauge in 1995. It has not carried passengers for many years and grain services between Roseberry to Hopetoun were suspended in 2005. A branch line was completed between Horsham, East Natimuk and Noradjuha in 1887, and progressively extended to Balmoral by 1920, where it connected with a line from Cavendish to Hamilton. The whole line, from Noradjuha to Hamilton, was closed in 1979. A branch was opened from East Natimuk to Goroke in 1894, and extended further west to Carpolac in 1927. It closed in 1986. A branch was opened from Dimboola to Jeparit in 1894 and extended to Rainbow in 1899 and Yaapeet in 1914. The line was converted to standard gauge in 1995. The line was deemed un-usable after severe flooding in January 2011. An announcement was made in September 2011 by the Victorian Government, that they would contribute $5.3 million to restoring the line from Dimboola to Rainbow. In 1905, a branch line was opened from Stawell to the Heatherlie quarry in The Grampians, from which large amounts of high-quality freestone were railed, to be used in a number of significant building projects. The branch was closed in 1949. Another branch line, from Jeparit to Lorquon, was opened in 1912, and was extended to Yanac in 1916. It closed in 1986. =Ararat southwards= A line was built from Ararat to Portland in 1877, via Maroona, Hamilton, and Heywood. A number of branch lines were built from this line, none of which are in use today. This line was converted to standard gauge in 1995. A line was opened from Gheringhap on the Geelong ‚Äì Ballarat line to Cressy and Maroona in 1913. This was converted to standard gauge in 1995 and became the Western standard gauge line between Melbourne and Perth.

From 1970 until his death, he was the coordinator of the percussion department at the California Institute of the Arts. Music career In 1959 Bergamo attended the Lenox School of Jazz in Lenox, Massachusetts, near Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony. Under a scholarship, he studied drums with Max Roach; had Percy Heath and Kenny Dorham as jazz band instructors; studied history and theory with Gunther Schuller, Marshall Stearns, and George Russell; and was classmates with Ornette Coleman, and Don Cherry. In 1962 Bergamo earned an M.M. degree from Manhattan School of Music (studying percussion with Paul Price and composition with Michael Colgrass), followed by three summers in Tanglewood and time in New York City as a freelance musician. In the fall of 1964, he joined the Creative Associates at the University at Buffalo. This group was formed by Lukas Foss, and its members included percussionist Jan Williams; composers George Crumb, Sylvano Bussotti, Mauricio Kagel, and Fred Myrow; bassist Buell Neidlinger; oboist / saxophonist Andrew White; singers Carol Plantamura, Sylvia Brigham Dimiziani, and Larry Bogue; trombonist Vinko Globokar; violinist Paul Zukofsky; clarinetist Sherman Friedlander; cellist Jay Humeston; pianist Michael Sahl; violist Jean Depuey; and flutist Karl Kraber. The Creative Associates explored avant-garde music in a variety of 20th Century styles, and performed regularly in Buffalo and in New York's Carnegie Hall. Some of the results of this group included the first book of madrigals by George Crumb, Vibone by Vinko Globokar, Passion Selon Sade by Sylvano Bussotti, and Songs from the Japanese by Fred Myrow. From this group Bergamo became involved in smaller groups with Buell Neidlinger, Charles Gayle, and Andrew White; and a trio with George Crumb and Paul Zukofsky. Relocating to the west coast in 1968, Bergamo taught briefly at the University of Washington before arriving at CalArts in 1970, where he taught from the school's origin until his retirement in 2005. On the west coast, he studied North and South Indian drumming as well as other non-European drumming traditions. Bergamo studied tabla with Mahaparush Misra, Ustad Alla Rakha, Pandit Taranath Rao, Shankar Ghosh, Swapan Chaudhuri, and South Indian drumming with T. H. Subash Chandran, T. H. Vinayakram, T. Ranganathan Poovalur Srinivasan, P.S. Venkatesan. Bergamo has also studied North Indian classical music with Ali Akbar Khan at the Ali Akbar College of Music in San Rafael, California, leading to a spell as Khansahib's road manager in late 1960s, and later playing with Ali Akbar Khan on works of a contemporary nature (such as the album Journey in 1990). In 1979 Bergamo studied the thavil in Chennai, India. Bergamo co-founded two all-percussion groups: The Repercussion Unit in 1976 with Larry Stein, Ed Mann, James Hildebrandt, Gregg A. Johnson, Paul Anceau, and Steven \\"Lucky\\" Mosko; and The Hands On'Semble with Andrew Grueschow, Randy Gloss, and Austin Wrinkle in 1997.

He frequently attends movie premieres, events, and interviews by himself and has the more exposure of the duo. These appearances have led to his being jokingly referred to as \\"The Non-Working Half of Yude\\". He claims to have been a naughty child in his younger days and that his favorite show was a TV Drama called Playgirl. He loved to read and draw manga, and before he met Nakai he would often draw Kinnikuman on notebook paper. Yoshinori Nakai : Artist. Hometown: Nishinari-ku, Osaka. Birth date: January 11, 1961. Recognizable Feature: Glasses. : A graduate of Hatushiba High School, up until 1984 he went by the name '. He has stated that he likes to stay home by himself and that his favorite actress is Mariko Kawana. Before he started school, he was an avid baseball player and fan and dreamed of one day becoming a Pro Baseball player. He liked to draw but has said that he didn't really read manga until he met Shimada. Meeting and debut In 1971 Nakai was transferred to Osaka Municipal Suminoe Elementary, where Shimada was attending the 4th Grade. They had different classes but lived in the same apartment building and got to know each other while riding the bus to school. One day in the 5th Grade when Nakai went to play at Shimada's house, Shimada showed him his pictures of Kinnikuman. When they both graduated to Osaka Municipal Nanryo Middle School, they began collaborating on manga ideas. Their first was an action manga called ', but they then experimented with other genres, such as baseball, karate, and romance. At first they drew strictly on notebook paper, but in the 8th Grade they drew ' on art paper and won the Kintetsu Manga Award. At that time they went by the pen name ', a fusion of their respective pen names at the time. After they completed Hatsushiba High School and graduated to college, they continued to submit works, hoping to become manga creators. From that point on, Shimada and Nakai began to share the story and art respectively. When they were 16, they submitted their wrestling manga ' to the Akatsuka Award and ' to the Tezuka Award. Though neither won, they were noticed by an editor at Shueisha and offered to do a one shot. In 1978, Kinnikuman almost won the 9th Akatsuka Award and then debuted in the 1979 #2 (December 1978) issue of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. Although the editorial staff viewed it as a childish work that was popular, then editor-in-chief Shigeo Nishimura saw through this and headed for Osaka in order to persuade their parents into letting them become professional manga creators. At the time, both young men were already looking for jobs, but Nishimura promised to take care of them and even got them an apartment in Tokyo. In May 1979, Kinnikuman began serialization. Career In 1978, Kinnikuman almost won the 9th Akatsuka Award and then later began serialization in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. Though originally a gag manga, from halfway through on it was a wrestling manga and became a big hit, later gaining an anime adaptation. There was also movies, special chapters, and infobooks. Also, the Choujin who appeared in the series soon appeared as keshi known as Kinkeshi, which became very popular amongst children and later came to America as M.U.S.C.L.E.. In 1982, the Kinnikuman character Ramenman became so popular that Yude made a one-shot chapter about him for Shueisha's Fresh Jump. This led to a monthly series entitled Tatakae!! Ramenman. In March 1985, Kinnikuman won the 30th Shogakukan Manga Award. After Kinnikuman ended, they tried several other genres of manga, but none of them ever became a big hit. In 1998 a sequel to Kinnikuman entitled Kinnikuman Nisei began serialization in Weekly Playboy and became their second big hit. It also started the Revival Manga boom.

The faith is practiced by more than 99.3% of the population, although this figure varies by source and percentage of the population who are classified as Animist. The vast majority of Muslims in Niger are Malikite Sunni with Salafi influences. Many of the communities who continue to practice elements of traditional religions do so within a framework of syncretic Islamic belief, making agreed statistics difficult. Islam in Niger, although dating back more than a millennium, gained dominance over traditional religions only in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and has been marked by influences from neighboring societies. Sufi brotherhoods have become the dominant Muslim organization, like much of West Africa. Despite this, a variety of interpretations of Islam coexist‚Äîlargely in peace‚Äîwith one another as well as with minorities of other faiths. The government of Niger is secular in law while recognising the importance of Islam to the vast majority of its citizens. Demographics Majority of Muslims are Sunni with many of those being linked to the Tijaniya Sufi brotherhoods.

Tuareg expansion from the north, culminating in their seizure of the far eastern oases from the Kanem-Bornu Empire in the 17th centuries, spread distinctively Berber practices. Both Zarma and Hausa areas were greatly influenced by the 18th and 19th century Fula led Sufi brotherhoods, most notably the Sokoto Caliphate (in today's Nigeria).James Decalo. Historical Dictionary of Niger. Scarecrow Press/ Metuchen. NJ - London (1979) pp. 156-7, 193-4. The region around Say, on the Niger River was a center of Sufi religious instruction and Maliki legal interpretation, imported by Fulani clerics in the 1800s. While the Qadiriyyah Sufi orders were dominant in Northern and eastern Niger in the 19th century, as well as those areas under the sway of the Sokoto Caliphate, the first two decades of the 20th century saw the rise of the Tijaniya, especially in the west of the country. Militantly anti-colonial Hammallism spread from Mali in the northwest in the 1920s, while much of the Kaocen Revolt of Tuareg groups was inspired by Sanusiya sects in what is today Libya. More recently, Senegalese Nyassist Sufi teachers, especially in the Dosso area have gained converts, while some small Arab Wahhabite teaching is funded in Niger‚Äîas in much of Africa‚Äîthrough Saudi Arabian missionary groups. Contemporary Islam =Government support= The government does not directly fund religion and is legally separated from religious practice, but has funded several Muslim-oriented programs, such as a Muslim radio ministry and given US$18.5 Million in 1982 towards the establishment of the Islamic University of Niger in Say, itself founded and partially funded through donations from the Arab world.Decalo (1997) p.170 The government has made three Muslim feasts national holidays, as well as two Christian holidays.International Religious Freedom Report 2001: Niger.

Tensions between these groups rose during the political instability marking the end of the Third Republic (1993‚Äì1996), attributed also to population movements of rural syncretic Muslims because of food shortages and political involvement of Nigerian groups and of the Niger military government who seized power between 1996-1999.School's still out for girls.

Education and Career Kroll was born in the town of Frankenstein in the Prussian Province of Silesia and brought up in Breslau, the capital city. From 1887 to 1891 he studied Classics, Archeology, History and Sanskrit at the universities of Breslau and Berlin. After obtaining his Ph. D. in 1891, Kroll went to Italy for the first of many times to study Greek manuscripts in Florence and Venice and continued his studies at the University of Bonn in the summer term of 1892. Before the end of the term he was awarded a four-year scholarship by the Prussian Academy of Sciences that gave him the means to further his academic career. Kroll returned to Italy where he continued and expanded his research from September 1893 until April 1894. Having obtained his habilitation at Breslau university in 1894, he continued to teach and publish as Privatdozent. After five years he was appointed full professor of Classics at the University of Greifswald where he started teaching in April 1899. A year later he married Katharina Wegener, the daughter of a schoolmaster. In March 1906, Kroll moved to the University of M√ºnster, a newly-adorned university with a significant number of students. In M√ºnster, Kroll strove to enhance the quality of studying for his students. His efforts to cooperate with his colleagues led to the foundation of the Institut f√ºr Altertumskunde (institute for antiquity studies) which included the departments of classics, ancient history and linguistics (archaeology followed in 1914). Nevertheless, Kroll persistently tried to secure a better position for himself and in 1913 succeeded to obtain a full professorship at his alma mater in Breslau. Apart from his teaching and publications, Kroll was an important agent for international collaboration in the classics. As an editor of important journals (Bursian‚Äôs Jahresbericht √ºber die Fortschritte der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft, 1898‚Äì1912; Glotta, 1913‚Äì1936) and the Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft (1906‚Äì1939, as successor to Georg Wissowa) he collaborated with hundreds of scholars from all over Europe and the United States. He was one of the first German scholars to be invited to lecture in the United Kingdom after World War I, and was awarded a visiting professorship at the Princeton University in 1930/31. His last years were overcast by the rise of Nazism in Germany. In 1934 he resigned as president of the Silesian Society for Patriotic Culture, a learned association that he had headed since 1927. In 1935, under new legislation, Kroll was retired earlier than usual. As his successor he opted for his long-time colleague Hans Drexler who had been an active supporter of the Nazi party. Drexler would later write Kroll's obituary in the Gnomon, apologising for his predecessor's alleged ‚Ä≥lack of a positive world view‚Ä≥. While not being a victim of the Nuremberg Laws himself, Kroll witnessed the removal of his colleagues from office and the persecution of his former pupils, some of whom he aided in finding work abroad. He also continued to collaborate with Jewish scholars in editing the Realencyclop√§die. For this Kroll was assaulted in the Nazi newspaper Der St√ºrmer, after he had already relocated to Berlin with his wife early in 1937. Meanwhile, academic institutions continued to appreciate and honor Kroll's achievement. He was elected ordinary member of the German Archeological Institute in 1934, corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1935 and fellow of the British Academy in 1937. He was also awarded honorary degrees by the universities of Oxford (1935) and Cambridge (1938). After an operation, Kroll died to an embolism on April 21, 1939. He was survived by his wife, a daughter and three sons, one of whom had emigrated to Japan in 1936 and later became a renowned physicist at the University of Taipei.

He was a founder of the Independent Republicans and a part of the administration for President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing. Poniatowski served as Minister of Health from 1973 to 1974 and Minister of the Interior in the Giscard d'Estaing government from 1974 to 1977. He was a founder and honorary president of the Union for French Democracy (Union pour la D√©mocratie Fran√ßaise, UDF). Biography and early career Poniatowski was the 7th great-grandson of Prince Kazimierz Poniatowski, older brother of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, who reigned as king of Poland from 1764 to 1795. Kasimierz had a son, Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski 1754‚Äì1833, whose son, Giuseppe Luci (1816‚Äì1873), by his mistress Cassandra Luci, was recognized and ennobled in the Austrian Empire on 19 November 1850 as Joseph Michel, Prince Poniatowski, a name and title recognised by Napoleon III when Poniatowski was naturalised in France and became a senator there, both in 1854. Two years later in Paris, Joseph's son, Prince Stanislas Poniatowski (1835‚Äì1908), married Louise Le Hon, generally reputed to be the daughter of Countess Le Hon (n√©e Fanny Mosselman) by Charles, Duke de Morny, the illegitimate son of Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut by Hortense de Beauharnais, sometime Queen consort of Holland as well as the adopted and step-daughter of Napoleon I; thus Louise Le Hon (as a granddaughter of Napoleon III's uterine half-brother) was a niece of the Emperor of France at the time of her marriage to Poniatowski, who was appointed the emperor's aide-de-camp. Their son, Andr√© Poniatowski (1864‚Äì1954) wed Stockton flour mill heiress Elizabeth Sperry in 1894. The son of that union, Prince Casimir Poniatowski (1897‚Äì1980), became the father of Michel by his 1920 marriage to Countess Anne de Caraman-Chimay (1901‚Äì1977), member of a Belgian princely family. Poniatowski attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school. He attended the ENA for finance and began his career in Morocco, later becoming a finance attach√© in Washington, DC in 1956. In 1958, he became the chief of staff for Pierre Pflimlin, the last president of the Council of the Fourth Republic before Charles de Gaulle. From 1959 to 1962, he was the chief of staff for prime minister Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, then charg√© de mission (1962‚Äì65), and finally director of Insurances at the Minister of Finance from 1963 to 1967. = 1970s = Poniatowski took a founding part in the Independent Republicans (RI) party, and became an RI deputy for the Val-d'Oise in 1967, as well as the general secretary of the Confederation of the Independents before taking the presidency of the party's successor, the Republican Party, in 1975. He was elected mayor of L'Isle-Adam (France) in 1971. Bernard Lehideux served Poniatowski as of his office in 1969. Poniatowski was then named Minister of Public Health and Social Security from 5 April 1973 to 27 May 1974, under the government of Pierre Messmer.  Minister of the Interior and State Minister (1974‚Äì1977)  Poniatowski succeeded Jacques Chirac on 24 May 1974, and served the post until 1977. Considered as the main organisator of Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing's victory at the 1974 presidential election, he was named Minister of State and Minister of the Interior on 27 May, which changed the official protocol of the Republic: the most important minister was not anymore the Minister of Justice. Although he was a strong-handed Interior Minister, he suppressed the personal registers (fiches signal√©tiques) which customers of a hotel were to sign (a custom in force in many countries). In August 1975, he sent the military to repress the nationalist rebellion headed by Corsican Edmond Simeoni who had illegally occupied a wine cave in Aleria. Two \\"gendarmes\\" were killed during the assault, leading him, along with Jacques Chirac, of being accused of a large part of the responsibility in the violence which then hit Corsica. Following the assassination of Prince Jean de Broglie, a Giscardian deputy, L'Express (January 1977) and then Le Canard encha√Æn√©, in 1980, published documents alleging that Poniatowski had known in advance of the death threats on de Broglie, and had not acted accordingly. The satirical newspaper recalled that de Broglie had been treasurer of the Independent Republicans, and tied to the Matesa scandal, which allegedly funded the RI. Soon after this affair, and the failure of the right-wing at the March 1977 municipal elections, Poniatowski quit the Ministry of Interior and would not be called again as minister. = 1980s = Poniatowski was a founding member, in 1978, of the Union for a French Democracy (UDF), the liberal and Christian-Democrat party which backed Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing and tried to rival Jacques Chirac's neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR). Until 1981, Michel Poniatowski was ambassador and personal representative of President Giscard. He was an MEP from 1979 to 1989, and presided in the European Parliament over the Commission on Development and Cooperation (1979‚Äì1984) then the Commission on Energy, Research and Technology (1984). Poniatowski approved in September 1983 the merger of the electoral list RPR-UDF with the far-right National Front (FN) party, headed by Jean-Marie Le Pen, during the partial municipal election of Dreux. He stated: \\"The fascist danger in France does not come from the right, but from the left, of which it is its spiritual vocation and method. One must therefore vote against the fascists of the left.\\"French quote: \\"Le danger fasciste en France ne vient pas de la droite, il vient de la gauche, dont c'est la vocation d'esprit et de m√©thode. Il faut donc voter contre les fascistes de gauche.\\" Poniatowski was then senator of the Val-d'Oise from 1989 to 1995, and continued to advocate in favour of electoral agreements with the National Front, taking as model the (difficult) relationship between the Socialist Party (PS) and the Communist Party (PCF). An atypical member of the UDF, which he had co-founded, he was first ignored by his colleagues for his support of the far-right ‚Äì the National Front's ascension is usually dated from the 1983 Dreux elections. After his support for electoral agreements with the FN during the 1992 regional elections and the 1993 legislative elections, he was finally disavowed by his fellow party members at the end of 1991, although he was neither excluded nor deprived of his honorary presidential functions. Like many members of the right-wing, he supported √âdouard Balladur against Chirac during the 1995 presidential election. Three years later, he participated to the right-wing party of Charles Millon, excluded from the UDF for the same reasons as Poniatowski, and they founded the Droite lib√©rale- chr√©tienne (Liberal-Christian Right) which continued to ally itself with the National Front. Poniatowski finally retreated from political life in 1999, replaced as mayor of L'Isle-Adam by his son Axel Poniatowski. He then died three years later, on 15 January 2002.

Champion was suspended at the end of 1902 by the national swimming association for failing to pay registration fees and was allowed to re-enter the sport in the southern summer of 1907-08. His suspension has often wrongly been called a life ban for professionalism. In 1911 he was the long-distance champion of England on the Thames. He had also represented Australasia at the 1911 Festival of Empire at The Crystal Palace, an early forerunner to the Commonwealth Games, where he pulled out of the mile race. Olympics Due to the financial difficulties faced by the New Zealand Olympic Committee, his swimming club had to fundraise for him and organize loans so he could travel to the 1912 Stockholm Olympics. At the Olympics, Champion carried the flag for the Australasian team. Champion was originally slated to compete in the 400 m and 1500 m freestyle events. He finished second in his 400 m heat behind Harold Hardwick and before finishing fourth in his semi-final to be eliminated. In the 1500 m event, he placed second in both his heat and semifinal, before abandoning in the final after 600 m. An ear infection to Bill Longworth resulted in Champion being promoted to the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay team. In the final on 15 July, Champion swam the second leg, and started equal with the American swimmer after Cecil Healy's first leg before building up a 10 m lead in his leg. Les Boardman extended the lead to 15 m before Harold Hardwick held off Duke Kahanamoku to claim the gold medal in the world record time of 10:11.6. The final was the third time that a world record had been set in that event at the Stockholm games, the first two times occurring on 12 July with the United States team swimming 10:26.4, only to be bettered later that day by the Australasian team who swam 10:14.0 (the United States team won the silver medal in the final).  Honours  Champion was New Zealand's only Olympic gold medalist in swimming until 1996, when Danyon Loader won in the 200 m and 400 m freestyle events at the Atlanta Olympics. In 1990 Champion became an inaugural inductee into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame. In 2005 the winning relay team was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, making Champion the only non- Australian inductee. Like Billy Savidan after him, he was for some years Custodian at Auckland‚Äôs Tepid Baths, and the walls of his office were adorned with sketches of ships by him.

He immigrated to the United States from Guangzhou, China, in 1859 at the age of 22. Chin stood out amongst his Chinese peers at the time in the United States as he dressed like a westerner and spoke perfect English. Background He worked on the First Transcontinental Railroad as the foreman of a group of Chinese railroad workers, many of whom Chin, himself, recruited and helped to gain passage into the United States. His leadership was important to the construction of the railroad because Chinese railroad workers were used to lay the steel rails. Following the completion of the railroad in 1869 he settled for a time in Black Hawk, Colorado where he was the unofficial leader of a group of Chinese immigrants who settled in a community called Cottonwood. Chin eventually achieved modest success in mining investments in Central City; by the 1870s, he had earned enough money to bring his family over from China. Upon their arrival, he moved to Denver, where he, as well as his children and descendants, became important figures in the city. He died in 1894 and was buried in Denver's Riverside Cemetery. In April 1901 his body was exhumed and transferred to China.

It was announced in September 2005 by Schlitterbahn Waterparks. The , $750 million development included a nearly waterpark, which is Schlitterbahn's fourth waterpark and its first outside Texas. Groundbreaking took place September 18, 2007 on the land formerly occupied by the Wyandotte County Fairgrounds and the Unified Government courthouse annex, across Interstate 435 from the Kansas Speedway and Village West. History Phase 1 included the opening of 12 water attractions, 3 restaurants, and 2 shops. Of those attractions, three were purchased from the former Geauga Lake amusement park in Ohio. Phase 2, named Schlitterbahn Vacation Village Resort was originally planned to include over 1,000 hotel rooms, a Scheels sporting goods store, and a Riverwalk area consisting of shops and restaurants on 300 acres surrounding the water park. Those plans were stalled and eventually abandoned due to the ongoing Great Recession. An expansion of the water park opened on April 30, 2011, with six new attractions. =Verr√ºckt and accident= In November 2012, Schlitterbahn Waterpark announced plans for the world's tallest and fastest water slide, Verr√ºckt. Designed by Schlitterbahn co-owner Jeff Henry, Verr√ºckt was a three-person raft slide with an uphill section. The initial drop was a 17-story plunge with a five-story uphill section. At , the starting point was taller than Niagara Falls and reached a maximum speed of . It opened on July 10, 2014, after multiple delays. On August 7, 2016, Caleb Schwab, the 10-year-old son of Kansas state representative Scott Schwab, died while riding Verr√ºckt. The death occurred when the raft he was in went airborne at the lower bump and impacted a metal support of the netting, decapitating him. The other two passengers, both women, were injured in the incident ‚Äî one suffered a broken jaw, while the other suffered a facial bone fracture and needed stitches. In the immediate aftermath, the park was closed pending an inspection. Although the park reopened three days later, the ride remained closed. An investigation found that the boy, who weighed , had been allowed to sit in the front of the raft, rather than between the two women accompanying him ‚Äî one weighed , while the other weighed . This led to an uneven weight distribution that contributed to the raft going airborne, despite the cumulative weight of , less than the maximum recommended weight of . Engineers who inspected the ride also commented that the ride's netting, used in areas where riders travel up to , \\"posed its own hazard because a rider moving at high speeds could easily lose a limb if they hit it\\". Their findings revealed that the use of the metal brace and netting system in the design, along with the use of hook and loop straps to restrain the riders, went against guidelines set by ASTM F-24 Committee on Amusement Ride and Devices. According to the guidelines, Verr√ºckt should have incorporated the use of a rigid over-the-shoulder restraint for riders, and an upstop mechanism to prevent the rafts from going airborne. =Aftermath= In 2018, the last operating season of the park, four attractions remained closed throughout the season after an audit by regulators found that each did not comply with the Kansas Amusement Ride Act. Demolition of the Verr√ºckt began on November 1, 2018. The park did not open for the 2019 season. On June 13, 2019 Cedar Fair agreed to buy Schlitterbahn's two parks in New Braunfels and Galveston for a price of $261 million. Additionally, Cedar Fair had the option for up to 120 days to buy the Kansas City location \\"for an additional $6 million\\". Cedar Fair did not pursue purchasing the property within those 120 days and the park remains standing but not operating.

Duke Ellington and his Orchestra are featured in the elaborate finale number.

Plot Jack Ellery (Oakie) is staging a lavish musical revue, starring Eric Lander (Brisson), Ann Ware (Carlisle), and Rita Ross (Michael), supported by a cast of a hundred background singers/dancers (almost all women, and many scantily clad) and two full orchestras. On opening night, just before the show, somebody tries to kill Ware several times. Ellery calls in police lieutenant Murdock (McLaglen) of the homicide squad to investigate. During the show a private detective and then Rita are murdered. Ellery hides this from the rest of the performers, claiming the victims are just sick, and talks Murdock into investigating while the revue continues on, otherwise Ellery will go broke. Several twists and turns follow, but finally the murders are solved just after the show ends. In the last scene, Nancy (Wing), a squeaky pretty blonde showgirl, finally gets to tell Ellery and Murdock what she has attempted to tell Ellery several times throughout the show. However, he kept putting her off, she was just trying to gain his attention, and he was too busy staging the show. She actually had a vital piece of information that would have solved the first murder much sooner, and might have prevented the second murder. Now that the show is over and a success, Ellery's attention is finally on her, and they go out for the night to celebrate. She giggles once again and moves off stage left in front of him, and then Oakie breaks the fourth wall just momentarily, looking into the camera with a devilish grin, before he follows her.

This woodcreeper is typically long and weighs . It is almost entirely rufous, with a paler throat and grey line from the bill to the eye. The bill is longish and straight. The call is a squeaky quink or loud deeah. The ruddy woodcreeper is found in premontane humid forest in lowlands and foothills up to , and also in adjacent semi-open woodland and clearings. Ruddy woodcreepers feed on spiders and insects. They will follow columns of army ants, sometimes in groups of up to three birds, dropping from saplings to catch prey fleeing the ants. It builds a leaf-lined nest up in a hollow palm tree stump, and lays 2‚Äì3 white eggs. Adult birds also sleep alone in tree crevices. Like other woodland birds, this species has been adversely affected by deforestation. For example, in Colombia it is apparently common in the northwestern Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, though otherwise a rather rare bird. This species apparently avoids human-altered habitat and secondary forest whenever possible. It is thus useful as a bioindicator. Nonetheless, it occupies a large range and wherever sufficient habitat remains, it is often not particularly uncommon. The IUCN considers it a Species of Least Concern.

History  Construction began with a ground breaking announcement in the Las Vegas Review Journal on April 6, 1944. The theater opened on October 10, 1944. It was operated by the Commonwealth Theater Company of Las Vegas, and later the Huntridge Theater Company of Las Vegas. Both companies were headed by Thomas Oakey of Las Vegas. The Huntridge Theater Company, which took ownership in 1951, was partially owned by actresses Loretta Young and Irene Dunne. The theater was built on land which had been owned by international business magnate Leigh S. J. Hunt, before he left it to his son Henry Leigh Hunt in 1933. The Huntridge Theater and the surrounding Huntridge subdivision are named after the Hunt family. The theater is said to have been the first non- segregated theater in Las Vegas.

We didn't have anywhere else to go, so we just set up our equipment in the parking lot and played for the 30 or 40 people who were still there.\\"Las Vegas Weekly Oct 7, 2004 While attempting to save the theater, it was operated by the non-profit Friends of the Huntridge Theatre, Inc. which dissolved in 2002. The Huntridge Theater closed on July 31, 2004, almost 60 years after it opened. The property is controlled by the Mizrachi family of Las Vegas, which owns a furniture store occupying a part of the property which used to house a bank. Since July 2012, a local nonprofit organization called The Huntridge Foundation has been working to preserve the architectural integrity, history and culture of the Huntridge Theater and the surrounding community. The nonprofit conducts oral history interviews of longtime Las Vegans who experienced the theater when it was open, collects theater memorabilia and photographs for a historic archives collection to be donated to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Libraries Special Collections Department upon completion, among other activities. As of April 2013, a potential redevelopment project has started and the theater has received new paint and exterior restoration.  Popular culture  In 2015, a Las Vegas record label emerged with the name Huntridge Records, in order to commemorate the historic theater. The label is based out of 11th Street Records, and it has signed one band, named The American Weather.

History Established as Camp Leona on March 13, 1849, Fort Inge was garrisoned intermittently until March 19, 1869. The fort served as a base for United States Army troops assigned to protect the southern overland mail route along the San Antonio-El Paso Road from Indian raids. The camp was renamed Fort Inge in honor of Lieutenant Zebulon M. P. Inge a West Point officer killed in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Fort Stockton, Fort Davis, Fort Bliss, Fort Mason, McKavett, Clark, Fort McIntosh, Richardson and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma.Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Enyon Printing Co. There were \\"sub posts or intermediate stations\\" including Bothwick's Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin. There were two wooden barracks with thatched roofs that quartered the soldiers assigned to the fort. There was also a large limestone building that served as commissary and later a hospital. The buildings at Ft. Inge were never sufficient for the troops stationed there, probably because this post was never determined by the Army to be a permanent post. It was started in 1849 but abandoned in the spring of 1851. It was reoccupied that same summer and occupied until 1855 when it was abandoned again. It was reoccupied a third time in 1856 but was abandoned in 1861 to Confederate States Army troops.Herbert M. Hart, Old Forts of the Southwest, Superior Publishing Company, Seattle, Washington, 1964, First Edition It was again garrisoned briefly in 1865 by the 4th Wisconsin Cavalry. The United States Army regarrisoned the fort until March 19, 1869, when the garrison was transferred to Fort McKavett. The army recovered materials from the site to use for additions to nearby Fort Clark. Fort Inge then saw use as a camp by the Texas Rangers until 1884. The fort was surrounded on three sides by a stacked stone wall added approximately at the time of the Civil War. The wall was dismantled in 1874 and the stone used to build a dam on the Leona River. The wall was relaid along its original lines in 1984. Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II was posted to Fort Inge in the early 1850s, and his letters from there are preserved by the Maryland Historical Society. =Major Neighbors= Robert Neighbors arrived at the fort on 7 April 1854, investigating Indian depredations and found the raiding party consisted of twelve Tonkawas, two of which were killed and nine turned over to the fort.Neighbours, K.F., 1975, Robert Neighbors and the Texas Frontier, 1836-1859, Waco: Texian Press Neighbors also freed the Lipan Chief Chiquito and his men from the guard house, and charged Indian Agent Howard with \\"dereliction of duty\\" for their false arrest and mismanagement of the Indian situation.

The bridge was painted green at time of construction (green being the state color of Washington). It is one of three bridges connecting Pasco to the other members of the Tri-Cities of Washington (Kennewick and Richland), along with the Cable Bridge to the east and the Interstate 182 Bridge from Richland to the northwest.  History  View from roadway The bridge was first proposed in 1949 as the previous bridge (commonly referred to as the \\"Green Bridge\\") was unable to handle the 10,000+ cars that were crossing it daily. Work on the bridge was begun in 1951. Work was completed in the summer of 1954 with a total cost of about $7 million. The bridge was dedicated on July 30, 1954. A United States flag flies atop the bridge, which was added during the re-decking of the bridge in 1989. During rush hour, the junction of U.S Route 395 and State Route 240 on the southbound side of the bridge is especially crowded. Late in 2005, it was announced that funding had been obtained in order to remedy the situation, by modifying the approaches and exits to the bridge, especially at the Highway 395 southbound exit on the Kennewick side of the bridge. This included constructing two roundabouts in place of the usual cloverleaf pattern. Construction began February 23 and was completed in October 2009.

Lown developed the direct current defibrillator for cardiac resuscitation and the cardioverter for correcting rapid disordered heart rhythms, and introduced a new use for the drug lidocaine to control heartbeat disturbances. Throughout his medical career, Lown focused on two major medical challenges: the problem of sudden cardiac death and the role of psychological stress on the cardiovascular system. His investigations led to many medical break-throughs. Among these were the coronary care unit. His work made possible and safe much of modern cardiac surgery, as well as a host of other innovations. In 1985, Lown accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, an organization he co-founded with Soviet cardiologist Yevgeny Chazov, who later was Minister Of Health of the USSR. Lown is currently Professor of Cardiology Emeritus at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and Senior Physician Emeritus at the Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. He is the founder of the Lown Cardiovascular Center and Lown Cardiovascular Research Foundation. He recently founded the Lown Institute, which aims to reform both the health care system and society. Early life and education Born to a JewishBernard Lown Interviewed by Peter Tishler, September 2011 family in Lithuania, the son of a rabbi,The Catholic Church in World Politics, By Eric O. Hanson, Princeton University Press, 14 Jul 2014, page 420 Bernard Lown emigrated to the United States at the age of 14. Lown graduated summa cum laude from the University of Maine and received an M.D. from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1945. His medical training included Yale-New Haven Hospital (Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut); Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY; and a cardiology fellowship at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (now Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, in Boston).‚ÄúBernard Lown and defibrillation,‚Äù M Eisenberg. Resuscitation, 2006; 69: 171-173 His mentor in cardiology was the renowned clinical cardiologist, Samuel A. Levine.The Lost Art of Healing, B Lown (Ballantine Books, 1996) Development of the defibrillator Lown helped raise international medical awareness of sudden cardiac death as a leading cause of mortality in the developed world. Based on patient observations, Lown concluded that sudden cardiac death was reversible and survivable, and that people who were successfully resuscitated could have a near normal life expectancy. Working with his mentor Samuel A. Levine, Lown realized that the high mortality of a heart attack, then 35 percent, was most likely due to rigorous bed rest. Patients remained completely recumbent for six or more weeks. A major complication of bed rest was pulmonary embolism, which accounted for a significant part of the mortality. Although Lown encountered enormous opposition and hostility among doctors to the so-called \\"chair treatment,\\" in 81 patients so treated, mortality was reduced by two thirds. Once the work was published, the chair treatment was rapidly adopted and hospitalizations were reduced to several days. Untold lives were saved by getting patients out of bed. Until the 1950s, ventricular fibrillation of the heart could only be treated with drug therapy. In 1956 American cardiologist Paul Zoll described resuscitations during open-heart surgery and later after sudden cardiac death by means of an alternating current (AC) electric shock, derived from a wall socket. AC current was untested as to its safety and efficacy and could cause death. In 1959, Lown demonstrated that AC was injurious to the heart and could be lethal. These investigations were conducted in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. The work was supported by Professor Frederick Stare, chairman of the Department of Nutrition. To find a safer method of cardiac resuscitation, Lown enlisted the help of Baruch Berkowitz, an electrical engineer employed by American Optical Company (AO). In their experimental work, Lown focused on two objectives: safety and efficacy. Alternating current caused burns in skeletal and heart muscle also inducing atrial as well as ventricular fibrillation in a large majority of the animal experiments. During a year of intense experimentation, in 1961 Lown and coworkers proved that a specific direct current (DC) waveform consistently reversed ventricular fibrillation, restoring a normal heart beat without injuring heart or skeletal muscle. This became widely known as the \\"Lown waveform.\\" It facilitated the worldwide acceptance of the defibrillator and cardioverter and improved survival of patients with coronary heart disease. The DC defibrillator provided a new approach for resuscitating patients. It also paved the way for new possibilities in cardiac surgery. The Lown clinical group were the first to use the defibrillator and cardioverter at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. Donald B. Effler, was the first cardiac surgeon to use the DC defibrillator in 1962 at the Cleveland Clinic. According to Effler, this advance made possible modern cardiac surgery.Letter to Lown. August 23, 1983 Indeed, in 1967, Rene Favoloro performed what is regarded as the first coronary artery bypass operation in Effler‚Äôs surgical department at Cleveland Clinic. DC defibrillation provided a safe way to restore a normal heart rhythm during the surgical bypass of obstructed coronary arteries. Lown went on to investigate the possibilities of the defibrillator to treat non-life-threatening tachycardias. He discovered that timing the electrical discharge outside the heart‚Äôs brief vulnerable period of 0.03 seconds in duration prevented ventricular fibrillation or sudden cardiac death. He called this method of timed DC discharge \\"Cardioversion.\\" The cardioverter and DC defibrillator were especially valuable in coronary care units, when patients are hospitalized when most susceptible to sudden cardiac death and other potentially malignant arrhythmias.The Lost Art of Healing, B Lown. (Ballantine Books, 1996), 201 In addition to advancing medical technology, Lown discovered new applications for two drugs that were widely used for cardiac problems: digitalis and lidocaine. Until the 1950s, digitalis poisoning was a major cause of fatality among patients with congestive heart failure. During a medical residency at the Montefiore Hospital in New York City, Lown demonstrated the critical role of potassium in determining the safe use of digitalis. His discovery led to abandonment of long acting digitalis drugs like digitoxin. Instead, the short acting digitalis glycoside gained universal acceptance. It also focused medical attention on potassium loss with the use of various diuretics.Atrial Arrhythmias, Digitalis and Potassium, B Lown, HD Levine (Landsberger Medical Books Inc., 1958) In 1964, Lown introduced a new use for the drug lidocaine to control ventricular disordered heart rhythms. Lidocaine was also used in coronary units to prevent the need for resuscitation. Previously, lidocaine was used almost exclusively by dentists as an anesthetic agent. Fiber optics In 1957, Lown was concerned with how to visualize an atherosclerotic aortic plaque, which occurs in the big coronary vessels that supply nutrients to the heart muscle. This would, he hoped, lead to discovering how to treat and prevent heart attack and sudden cardiac death. A discussion with a close friend, Elias Snitzer, a physicist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology led to an introduction to Michael Polanyi, a physicist with American Optical Company. At the time, Polanyi was working on fiber optics. Lown received a grant from the Hartford Foundation to pursue fiber optics. However, optical technology, at the time, was inadequate. This line of research was discontinued. Lown's work did show that, with fiber optics, it was possible to measure oxygen saturation in dogs, and determine the cardiac output in humans. Paradoxically, when Lown submitted two abstracts to the World Cardiology Conference in Mexico in 1964, one on the defibrillator and cardioversion, and one dealing with fiber optics, the former was rejected and the latter accepted. Peace activism =Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR)= In early 1961, Lown called together a group of physicians from Boston‚Äôs teaching hospitals to address the mounting threat of nuclear war between the USSR and the USA. This political subject had not been addressed previously by physicians in the United States. The new organization called itself Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR). Among the activist participants were Jack Geiger and Victor W. Sidel.Prescription for Survival, B Lown (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2008) By the end of 1961, the group had drafted five research articles about the medical consequences of a ten megaton nuclear attack on the city of Boston, a magnitude considered both possible and likely by the U.S. military. The series, \\"The Medical Consequences of Thermonuclear War\\", was published as a symposium in the New England Journal of Medicine in May 1962.http://ippnw.org/pdf/1962NEJM.pdf. New England Journal of Medicine, May 31, 1962 These articles encouraged anti-nuclear medical movements worldwide. Additionally, they helped pass the Limited Test Ban Treaty in the U.S. Senate. =Committee of Responsibility for War Injured Vietnamese Children (COR)= Lown was also involved in organizing COR, the Committee of Responsibility to Save War Burned and War Injured Children, of which he was a leading member. This organization aimed to bring injured and burned Vietnamese children for treatment in the United States, in order \\"to bring the war home.\\" COR was headed by Herbert Needelman. It arranged for several American hospitals to treat injured Vietnamese children for free. John Constable III, from the Shriner Burn Center of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, was among the first physicians to participate. He and other physicians traveled numerous times to Vietnam to choose children with injuries that could be helped. This mission could not be accomplished without ambulance planes ferrying the very sick children. Lown led a delegation to Washington for a meeting with William F. Bundy, then Assistant Secretary of State. He was persuaded to support the objective of COR. In 1967 the Pentagon began to transport Vietnamese children to the USA. =International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW)= In 1980, Lown called on a small number of doctors to organize against the mounting nuclear threat that followed USSR's invasion of Afghanistan and the election of the Reagan administration. This small group of physicians, with the help largely of first year Harvard medical students, formed the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW). This IPPNW could not have been founded without the intimate friendship between Eugene Chazov and Lown. Both cardiologists, they had collaborated in researching the issue of sudden cardiac death, sponsored by the National Heart and Lung Institute. Lown headed the American Sudden Death Task Force, while Chazov headed the Soviet group of cardiologists. Frequent visits to the USSR with American cardiological colleagues promoted dialogue and understanding between physicians of the two hostile countries. It laid the groundwork and made the IPPNW possible. These events are described in Lown's memoir, Prescription for Survival: A Doctor's Journey to End Nuclear Madness.Prescription for Survival, B Lown (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2008). The first IPPNW annual World Congress was held at Arlie House, Virginia, in 1981. Eighty medical leaders from twelve countries attended. In 1982, the 2nd IPPNW Congress took place in Cambridge, England with over 400 participants. Among the American participants were astrophysicist and science populizer, Carl Sagan; Admiral Noel Gayler, formerly head of the American Pacific Fleet, Director of the National Security Agency, and in charge of targeting nuclear weapons against he USSR; Howard Hiatt, Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health; and Herbert Abrams, head of Radiology at the Harvard Medical School. Equally distinguished participants attended from the UK, Germany, and Scandinavian countries. A major breakthrough for IPPNW was arranged by Eugene Chazov in 1982 when three Soviet physicians and three American physicians appeared on a nationwide Soviet television network. The Soviet participants were Chazov, Michael Kuzin, and Leonid Ilyin; while the Americans were Lown, James Muller, and John Pastore. During this unprecedented telecast an audience of 100 million Soviet viewers for the first time heard an unedited discussion of the consequences of nuclear war. The program was later broadcast in the US. By 1985, IPPNW represented 135,000 physicians in 60 countries. In December of that year, Lown and Chazov accepted the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of IPPNW. Shortly thereafter, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev invited IPPNW Co- Presidents Lown and Chazov for a meeting in the Kremlin. The lengthy discussion covered a host of issues. Discussed was Gorbachev's unilateral moratorium on nuclear weapons testing, the arrest and detention of Nobel Laureate physicist Andrei Sakharov in the city of Gorki, the North-South divide, and other important subjects. International public health work =SatelLife and ProCor= Two organizations founded by Lown, SatelLife (1988) and ProCor (1997) were designed to aid physicians in developing countries by connecting them to relevant information on cardiovascular disease and its prevention. Their focus was on global inequities in healthcare and leveraging technology to promote health equality. SatelLife employed low earth-orbit satellites that circumnavigated the poles and were capable of reaching every point on earth four times daily. They provided access to medical literature to health professionals in developing countries. ProCor created an internet network of health workers in developing countries around the world. This internet-based community enabled physicians and health workers to access relevant and reliable medical information about cardiovascular disease. The focus was on disease prevention. It also offered an email-based forum for discussion. ProCor‚Äôs global outreach included The Ashanti-ProCor Project, launched in 2006, which was designed to assess cardiovascular disease knowledge and practice among health workers in the Ashanti Region of Ghana, identify those who can play a key role in prevention, and explore their information needs as a way to better address the needs of physicians in the developing world. =Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Healthcare= In 1996, Lown, with Stephanie Woolhandler and David Himmelstein of the Cambridge City Hospital; Jerry Avorn, head of Pharmacoepidemiology at the Harvard Medical School; and Susan Bennett, a primary care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital formed the Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Healthcare. Many health workers joined the Ad Hoc Committee, the objective of which was to promote a single- payer healthcare system in Massachusetts In 1997, a letter signed by over 2000 Massachusetts physicians outlined the need for single-payer healthcare. The letter was published in The Journal of the American Medical Association.For Our Patients, Not for Profits: A Call to Action. JAMA. 1997;278(21):1733-1738 The Ad Hoc Committee canvassed people through the state of Massachusetts to gain the 100,000 names necessary to put the issue on the ballot. The issue was put to referendum in Massachusetts in 2000. In spite of opposition, the referendum showed 45% of voters in favor of single-payer healthcare. =The Lown Institute and the Right Care Alliance= In 2012, Lown and colleagues founded the Lown Institute. The Lown Institute addresses the growing crisis in healthcare in the USA, marked by overtreatment, undertreatment, and mistreatment through research, clinical programs, and convenings. The Institute holds an annual conference, where the newest research on overuse and underuse is presented, and where like-minded clinicians and patient advocates can share ideas. They also sponsor clinical programs to address overuse such as the Right Care Educators program, Right Care Rounds, and the Right Care Vignette Competition. The Lown Institute is currently conducting research on risk adjustment methods for evaluating patient outcomes. Among participants in the leadership of the Lown Institute are Nassib Chamoun, Vikas Saini, Shannon Brownlee, Thomas Graboys, Professor Joseph Brain, Patricia Gabow, Elizabeth Gilbertson, James Joslin, Aretha Davis, David Bor, Michael Fine, Breck Eagle, and others. The Right Care Alliance (RCA) is the sister organization of the Lown Institute and the advocacy wing. The Right Care Alliance brings together clinicians, patients, and community members into a grassroots movement advocating for a universally accessible, affordable, safe, and effective health care system. The RCA is organized into specialty councils and regional chapters that organize on topics specific to their specialty or region. The RCA holds a week of action every year, in which members organize activities that demonstrate compassionate, patient-centered care, such as engaging the broader community in listening and storytelling. The Steering Committee of the RCA is chaired by Vikas Saini and Shannon Brownlee, and members include Poppy Arford, Maia Dorsett, Casey Wilson, Selwyn Rogers, Jonathan Jimenez, Jane Muir, Theresa Ojala, Stuart Fisk, Marlene Beggelman, Kim DiGioia, and Surafel Tsega. Personal life Lown is married; he and his wife, Louise, have three children. Awards and honors Dedication of the Bernard Lown Peace Bridge in October 2008. Rightmost: Bernard Lown Lown has received numerous awards including the Golden Door Award from the International Institute of Boston; the Dr. Paul Dudley White Award from the American Heart Association; the Distinguished Emeritus Professor from Harvard School of Public Health; the Distinguished Medical Alumnus Award by Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; and the highest honor from the country of Lithuania: the Cross of Commander of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas, the Gandhi Peace Award, and the first Cardinal Medeiros Peace Award, as well as 21 honorary degrees from universities both in the United States and abroad. In 1993, he delivered the Indira Gandhi Memorial Lecture in New Delhi. The bridge that connects the cities of Lewiston and Auburn in Maine was renamed The Bernard Lown Peace Bridge upon an act by the state legislature that was signed into law by Governor John Baldacci in 2008. The Brigham and Women's Hospital in 2009 established the Bernard Lown Educational award. The recipient is selected by staff and students. =Honors from the Harvard School of Public Health= The Lown Scholars Program at the Harvard School of Public Health aims to assist promising health professionals who live and work in low- and middle-income countries. \\"[The program] is designed to create an international cadre of talented health professionals [...] who will use public health tools and strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease and promote cardiac health.\\" =The Lown Visiting Professor= In 2012, a visiting Professorship was established whose function is to coordinate the courses afforded to the Lown Scholars as well as help promote cardiovascular preventative programs in low- and middle-income countries.

He entered the navy in the 1840s after initially serving in the merchant marine. In 1848, Jachmann received his first command, the corvette ; through the 1850s and early 1860s, he held several other commands, including the frigates ‚Äîaboard which he took part in the Eulenburg expedition to East Asia‚Äîand . During the Second Schleswig War in 1864, he commanded Prussian naval forces in the Baltic from Arcona, and led a small squadron at the Battle of Jasmund on 17 March. Though defeated in that battle, he was promoted to Konteradmiral (rear admiral) for his aggressive handling of the Prussian fleet. Jachmann was the senior-most officer in the Prussian Navy by the mid-1860s, second only to Prince Adalbert of Prussia. In 1867, Jachmann became the director of the Ministry of the Navy, and the following year, he was promoted to Vizeadmiral. During the Franco- Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, he commanded the squadron of ironclad warships based in the North Sea, though his ships saw no action owing to engine difficulties. After the war, he oversaw the founding of the Imperial Naval Academy at Kiel and the organization of the North Sea Naval Station. He expected to be named the first Chief of the Imperial Admiralty in 1872, but he was passed over in favor of the Prussian Army General Albrecht von Stosch. Embittered by the decision, Jachmann retired from the navy in 1874. Jachmann retired to Oldenburg with his family, though he returned to naval affairs in 1878 following the accidental sinking of during a training cruise. Jachmann used the incident to attack Stosch, first through anonymously published letters criticizing his training program, and then as part of a court martial that placed blame for the accident on Carl Ferdinand Batsch, Stosch's protege. Jachmann thereafter left the public eye until his death on 21 October 1887. Early life Jachmann was born in Danzig on 2 March 1822, the youngest of seven children, to Dr. R. H. Jachmann and Minna Jachmann (n√©e Schaff). Eduard attended grammar school in Marienwerder. Against his father's wishes, Jachmann joined the merchant marine as a cabin boy in Danzig in 1839; at the time, it was uncommon for an educated young man to join the shipping industry. Over the winter of 1842‚Äì1843, he attended the navigation school in Danzig and he passed his examination on 20 March 1843. He also served aboard ships on voyages to the Americas into 1844. Naval career In early 1843, as the Prussian Navy looked forward to the completion of the corvette , it began searching for cadets at the Danzig navigational school to form the ship's crew. Jachmann was one of those studying at the school recruited into the navy; Jachmann came aboard the ship in 1844 while it was made available to the school for training purposes. During a training cruise that lasted from June to October 1845, Jachmann held one of the officer positions aboard the vessel, but he had not been officially promoted to officer rank. The cruise went into the Atlantic Ocean and into the Mediterranean Sea, and included stops in London, Genoa, Algiers, Madiera, and Portsmouth. Another Mediterranean cruise followed in July 1846; Jachmann served as the ship's executive officer, second in command to the captain, Jan Schr√∂der, a Dutch officer who had been hired to provide naval expertise.Sondhaus, pp. 9‚Äì12 Illustration of the corvette , Jachmann's first command On 27 May 1847, he was formally promoted to second lieutenant. A fourth training cruise followed four days later, lasting until October. On their return, Jachmann and the other officers were sent to winter quarters in Danzig.Sondhaus, p. 13 In November 1848, during the Revolutions of 1848 and the concurrent First Schleswig War against Denmark, Schr√∂der was promoted and Jachmann succeeded him as Amazones commander. Jachmann was promoted to first lieutenant on 29 March 1849. He took Amazone to Stettin for operations against the Danish fleet. She saw no action, however, as the Danes focused their attention on the larger Reichsflotte (Imperial Fleet) in Bremen.Sondhaus, pp 38‚Äì41 On 15 July 1850, the Danish blockade fleet entered Swinem√ºnde and seized several Prussian vessels; Jachmann did not sortie to recapture the vessels, which cast suspicion on him and nearly cost him his command. Amazone, of only , was too weak to challenge the Danish and the only other Prussian vessels in the area were small gunboats of even lesser value as warships. As a result, Jachmann was exonerated.Stenzel, p. 592 Through the 1850s, Jachmann held a variety of roles. He served as the executive officer aboard the frigate , again as the commander of Amazone, and as the shipyard director at the K√∂nigliche Werft (Royal Shipyard) in Danzig. During this period, Jachmann commanded a flotilla of ten gunboats during exercises in July and August 1851.Sondhaus, p. 43 In 1855, Jachmann was promoted to the rank of Korvettenkapit√§n (Corvette Captain).Sondhaus, p. 49 On 3 December 1856, he was appointed as the Director of the Technical Department of the Admiralty. Jachmann was promoted again in 1859, to the rank of Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea). By this time, Jachmann was the third highest ranking officer in the Prussian Navy, behind only Prince Adalbert of Prussia and the Swedish captain Henrik Sundewall. From 1859 to 1862, he commanded the frigate during the Eulenburg expedition to East Asia. Sundewall, the squadron commander, flew his flag aboard the frigate ; in addition to Thetis, his command also included the schooner and the clipper ship Elbe. The ships, without Elbe as she sailed to Singapore directly, sailed to Rio de Janeiro and then to Cape Town before meeting with Elbe in Singapore. There, the squadron embarked the diplomat Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg. On arriving in China, Eulenberg concluded a trade treaty with the Qing government. On the way back to Germany, Jachmann had been instructed to investigate Patagonia as the site of a possible German colony, but he ignored the command, citing the poor condition of his ship after the long voyage to East Asia, and in particular after a severe storm had badly damaged her in South American waters. Indeed, Jachmann had to put into Salvador, Bahia in Brazil for repairs.Sondhaus, pp. 67‚Äì69 =Wars of German unification= Painting of the Battle of Jasmund, depicting the Prussian squadron, by Willy St√∂wer At the start of the Second Schleswig War in 1864, the bulk of the Prussian fleet was concentrated in the Baltic Sea. Prince Adalbert was the senior navy commander, and Jachmann, as the senior-most captain, became the squadron commander, with Arcona as his flagship. The much larger Danish fleet blockaded Prussia's main ports, trapping Jachmann's ships‚ÄîArcona and ‚Äîin Swinem√ºnde. On 17 March, Jachmann took his two ships and the armed paddle steamer out to challenge the Danish blockade force. In the ensuing Battle of Jasmund off the island of R√ºgen, Jachmann's squadron was defeated by the more powerful Danish squadron and forced to retreat. This was to be the only major naval battle fought in the Baltic during the war. Nevertheless, he was appointed Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) for his aggressive handling of the fleet at Jasmund.Sondhaus, pp. 75‚Äì77 The arrival of a Danish ironclad warship precluded any further attacks on the Danish fleet, as the traditional guns that armed Jachmann's ships were entirely useless against the armored vessel. On 24 March 1865, with the fleet having returned to its demobilized, peacetime status, Jachmann was given command of the Marinestation der Ostsee (Naval Station of the Baltic Sea). Later that year, Jachmann moved the fleet to its new main base at Kiel in the newly annexed Duchy of Schleswig. There, he was responsible for establishing the new base, the land defenses for which were established at H√∂rup Haff and Holtenau Bay under the direction of Generals Helmuth von Moltke, the Chief of the General Staff, and Albrecht von Roon, the Prussian Minister of War. Later that year, Jachmann accompanied Roon aboard Loreley for a survey of the Jade Bay, where the naval base at Wilhelmshaven was planned.Sondhaus, pp. 78‚Äì80Stenzel, pp. 592‚Äì593 Jachmann remained in his post in the Baltic Sea during the Austro-Prussian War, commanding the main squadron of frigates and corvettes. Before the outset of hostilities, he sent the gunboat to Elbe to block the movement of an Austrian brigade that was garrisoned in Holstein. Since the Austrian fleet was occupied with Prussia's ally Italy during the war, the Prussian Navy saw relatively little action; the only major operations were conducted in the North Sea, under the command of KzS Reinhold von Werner.Sondhaus, pp. 83‚Äì84Stenzel, p. 593 On 17 July 1867, Jachmann attended the fleet review held in Spithead, Britain in honor of the Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlaziz. On 22 August, he became of the director of the Ministry for the Navy, serving under Roon. Jachmann and Roon were good friends, which led to an effective partnership between the two. Jachmann presented his fleet plan in October that year, as part of Roon's overall military budget. The plan projected a ten-year construction program for sixteen ironclad warships, twenty corvettes, and eight avisos. Jachmann included the large number of corvettes to bring pro-colonialist factions to support the plan, though he was himself ambivalent to colonial aspirations. The Reichstag approved Roon's budget without objection.Sondhaus, p. 86 Jachmann was promoted to Vizeadmiral (VAdm‚ÄîVice Admiral) on 22 March 1868;Sondhaus, p. 94 he was the first man to hold that rank in the Prussian Navy.Stenzel, p. 591 By mid-1869, the ironclads that the navy had begun to acquire under Jachmann's direction had started to enter service, permitting the formation of an ironclad squadron.Stenzel, pp. 593‚Äì594 At the start of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870, Jachmann left Berlin to take command of the ironclad squadron based in Wilhelmshaven. At the time, Jachmann had under his control the ironclads , , , and . Work had not yet been completed on the fortifications outside Kiel and Wilhelmshaven; Jachmann ordered the acquisition of naval mines, a technology then still in its infancy, to help defend the German coast. The French Northern Squadron had arrived off the North Sea coast to blockade Germany's ports. He sortied with the fleet in late August, but located no French warships. K√∂nig Wilhelm and Friedrich Carl thereafter developed engine problems, preventing Jachmann from taking further offensive actions, for which he was publicly criticized. For its part, the French blockade was poorly planned and achieved little of significance. By 11 September, all four of his ships were again operational, but by that time the French fleet had abandoned the blockade. Owing to the ineffectiveness of the ironclad fleet, none of its officers were decorated after the war.Stenzel, pp. 594‚Äì595Sondhaus, pp. 94‚Äì96 =Later career= With the war over, Jachmann returned to Berlin to several projects, including organizing a North Sea naval station and conducting an evaluation of the naval mines used during the war. He also oversaw the rapid expansion of the base at Wilhelmshaven and the establishment of the Imperial Naval Academy at Kiel. The two s were ordered from British shipyards in the anticipation that France would launch a war of revenge in the near future. Jachmann came under intense criticism in the press and the Reichstag for the orders, since they had not been given to German shipyards, though at that time German shipbuilders were not sufficiently developed to build vessels of that size quickly.Stenzel, pp. 595‚Äì596 In 1872, the navy command was reorganized as the Imperial Admiralty. As the highest ranking naval officer, Jachmann expected to be given the role as the Chief of the Imperial Admiralty, but General Albrecht von Stosch received the position instead. Jachmann had not proved himself an effective administrator in the 1860s, nor had he impressed Wilhelm I with his handling of the fleet during the Franco-Prussian War. Instead, he remained the commander of the active naval forces, and was given a spot on the Admiralty board, though Stosch never actually convened the board while Jachmann was in the navy. Following the death of Prince Adalbert in June 1873 and the retirement of Roon the following October, Jachmann lost his most powerful friends, and Stosch largely ignored him. The fact that Jachmann came from a middle class background and had no formal higher education served to isolate him in the officer corps Stosch sought to create, which was modeled on the aristocratic army officer corps. Jachmann requested retirement in February 1874; he was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle, 1st Class with Swords, on 17 February and thereafter left the service. Stosch then purged numerous other senior officers with similar backgrounds.Sondhaus, pp. 101‚Äì104Stenzel, pp. 596‚Äì597 Jachmann's grave in Oldenburg In May 1878, the new ironclad was accidentally rammed and sunk by K√∂nig Wilhelm. Jachmann, still bitter at being passed over in favor of Stosch, anonymously published an article in Deutsche Revue severely criticizing Stosch's training policies, which he alleged favored military discipline and theory over practical seamanship. Jachmann was appointed a member of the court martial that investigated the accident and the role of Carl Ferdinand Batsch‚Äîthe captain of K√∂nig Wilhelm and Stosch's protege. Jachmann was at that time not known to be the author of the article, and he did not recuse himself. The court ruled against Batsch but did not issue a punishment. Batsch appealed to Stosch, arguing that Jachmann and the also retired VAdm Eduard Klatt had not been impartial judges. Kaiser Wilhelm I agreed to appoint a second court martial that did not include either man.Sondhaus, pp. 130‚Äì131 Jachmann retired to Oldenburg with his family, which included his wife Anna (whom he had married in 1852 in Trutenau near K√∂nigsberg), his daughter, and three sons. One of his sons, Siegfried von Jachmann, went on to serve in the Imperial Navy and reached the rank of Konteradmiral. Eduard appeared in public one last time on 18 May 1885, after Wilhelm I called on him to give the christening speech for the new corvette in Danzig. Jachmann died in Oldenburg on 21 October 1887.Stenzel, p. 597Verchau, pp. 212‚Äì213 Notes References  Category:1822 births Category:1887 deaths Category:Vice admirals of the Imperial German Navy Category:German military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War Category:Prussian naval officers Category:Military personnel from Gda≈Ñsk Category:People from West Prussia ","title":"Eduard von Jachmann"},{"id":"5996413","text":"Double dip or double dipping may refer to:  Food  , biting a chip and then re-dipping it into a dip * Double Dip (confectionery), flavored powders with an edible stick to dip into them  Economics  Double-dipping, the practice of releasing multiple special editions of a media product to consumers or of being illegitimately compensated a second time for the same activity * Double-dip recession, a recession shape used by economists  Other  Double Dip, a \\"lifeline\\" in the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? franchise * Double dip (roller coaster element), a downward portion of a \\"hill\\" which is divided into two separate drops * Double dipping, metaphor for circular analysis in statistics * Double dipping (in US political commentary) or dual mandate, an elected official holding more than one elected or public position concurrently * Double dipping, a hybrid open-access model used by journals to receive payments for guaranteeing open access of an article while also charging readers for accessing it  See also  \\"Second Bite of the Apple\\" * Three Bites of the Apple ","title":"Double dip"},{"id":"5996416","text":"Black Butte may refer to: PlacesBlack Butte (Glenn County, California), a mountain in the Northern Coast Ranges, California *Black Butte (Siskiyou County, California), a volcano in California Black Butte, California, a community in Siskiyou County, California *Black Butte (Colorado), a mountain in Baca County, Colorado *Black Butte (Stillwater County, Montana), a mountain in Stillwater County, Montana *Black Butte (Madison County, Montana), a peak in the Gravelly Range, Montana *Black Butte (Clark County, Nevada), a summit in Mesquite Valley, Nevada *Black Butte (South Virgin Mountains), a summit northwest of Bitter Ridge in Clark County, Nevada *Black Butte (Oregon), a volcano in Deschutes County Black Butte Ranch, Oregon, a planned community in Deschutes County *Black Butte, Oregon, a former community in Lane County Other usesBlack Butte Porter, a beer by Deschutes Brewery See also Black Buttes, an extinct stratovolcano in Washington state * List of peaks named Black Butte ","title":"Black Butte"},{"id":"5996453","text":"Garo may refer to: People and languages Garo people, a tribal people in India  Garo language, the language spoken by the Garo tribe Places Kingdom of Garo, a former kingdom in southern Ethiopia * Garo, Colorado * Garo Hills, part of the Garo-Khasi range in Meghalaya, India Persons Garo (name), an Armenian given name * Emma Garo, a judge from the Solomon Islands * Isabelle Garo, a French philosopher Film and television =Japanese= Garo (franchise), a Japanese tokusatsu TV franchise * Garo (TV series), sometimes referred to as Golden Knight Garo, Japanese tokusatsu television series * Garo: Yami o Terasu Mono, a Japanese tokusatsu television series, premiering April 2013 * Garo: Makai no Hana, Japanese tokusatsu television drama.

It travels diagonally from northwest to southwest within Benton County, serving the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and the Tri-Cities region. The highway begins at a junction with SR 24 and travels around Richland on a limited- access bypass. From there, it briefly overlaps Interstate 182 (I-182) and continues southeast as a freeway along the Columbia River into Kennewick, terminating at an interchange with U.S. Route 395 (US 395). SR 240 is one of the busiest highways in the Tri-Cities region, with a daily average of 76,000 vehicles on a section crossing the Yakima River Delta. The riverfront route between Richland and Kennewick was part of a 19th-century wagon road and the Inland Empire Highway, a state road established in 1913. It was incorporated into US 410 in 1926 and was part of US 12 from 1967 to 1986. The highway through the Hanford Nuclear Reservation was established as a state highway in the 1950s and opened on July 14, 1965, to connect Richland to the Vernita Bridge on SR 24\\\\. Route description SR 240 westbound at its terminus with SR 24 on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation SR 240 begins at an intersection with SR 24 west of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in northwestern Benton County. SR 24 continues west towards Yakima and north across the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River on the Vernita Bridge. (Inset map) SR 240 travels southeasterly along Cold Creek Valley at the foot of the Yakima Ridge and Rattlesnake Hills, forming the boundary between the Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge (part of the Hanford Reach National Monument) and the rest of the Hanford Site, including the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Cold Creek empties into the Yakima River near the Horn Rapids Dam, where the highway intersects SR 225, which continues southwest to Benton City. About downstream from the dam, SR 240 enters the city of Richland and continues its southeasterly course along the north side of the Yakima River. The highway passes the city's landfill and a suburban golf course before reaching an intersection with Stevens Drive and Jadwin Avenue at the edge of Richland's residential neighborhoods. From the intersection, SR 240 turns southwest onto the six-lane Bypass Highway, which acts as a divided highway with limited intersections that travels around the west side of Richland. Jadwin Avenue continues southeast from the intersection as a business route of SR 240, while Stevens Drive continues north to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The Bypass Highway is followed to the west by the Tri-City Railroad, formerly the main rail link to the Hanford Site and now owned by the Port of Benton, and to the east by the multi-use Urban Green Belt Trail. The highway travels south around Richland's suburban neighborhoods and passes the Richland Airport. SR 240 intersects SR 224 at Van Giesen Street, providing connections to West Richland and Benton City, and continues southeast along the Yakima River to the Chamna Natural Preserve. At the park, SR 240 crosses over and intersects Interstate 182 (I-182) in a trumpet interchange, beginning a short concurrency with I-182 and the already-overlapping U.S. Route 12 (US 12). The three highways continue east for approximately and reach a cloverstack interchange with George Washington Way, a local road that carries part of SR 240 Business. From the interchange, SR 240 turns south and crosses the Yakima River towards Kennewick, while I-182 and US 12 continue east across the Columbia River to Pasco. Aerial view of SR 240 along the Columbia River in Kennewick SR 240 continues across the Yakima River Delta as a fully grade- separated freeway, fronted to the west by a branch of the Union Pacific Railroad and the east by the Sacagawea Heritage Trail. The freeway narrows to six lanes at an interchange with the Columbia Park Trail in the Richland Wye and to four lanes at a partial cloverleaf interchange with Columbia Center Boulevard, located north of the Columbia Center Mall and the Toyota Center. SR 240 enters Kennewick after the interchange and continues along the south side of the Columbia River and Columbia Park, passing north of suburban neighborhoods and the Vista Field airport, which closed in 2013. The freeway intersects Edison Street and Columbia Park Trail on the north side of the railroad before reaching its eastern terminus, a dogbone interchange with US 395 at the south end of the Blue Bridge. The interchange also includes direct ramps to the northbound lanes of US 395 as well as access to Columbia Drive, a local street that connects to downtown Kennewick. The junction is located near the site where the Kennewick Man, a skeleton belonging to a 9,000-year-old man, was discovered in 1996. SR 240 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. The busiest section of the highway, across the Yakima River Delta south of I-182, carried a daily average of 76,000 vehicles in 2016; the least busiest section of the highway, near its intersection with SR 24, carried only 2,600 vehicles. The Bypass Highway section of SR 240 in Richland is designated as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads identified as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The corridor, along with the freeway section from Richland to Kennewick, was also designated as a Highway of Statewide Significance by the Washington State Legislature. History The highway between Richland and Kennewick was originally part of the first federal wagon road to be constructed in the Pacific Northwest, laid in 1853 between Fort Walla Walla and the Puget Sound region via Naches Pass. The wagon road is commemorated with a historic marker in Columbia Park, just north of the Edison Street interchange on SR 240. Local Native American tribes also used a trail following the route of the Hanford Highway to reach points west of Rattlesnake Mountain, including Yakima. By the early 1910s, several unpaved roads connected Richland to the Cold Creek Valley and Kennewick via a more westerly crossing of the Yakima River Delta. The Richland‚ÄìKennewick section was incorporated into the Inland Empire Highway, a paved cross-state route created by the legislature in 1913. The Yakima Valley section of the Inland Empire Highway, later numbered as State Road 3 and Primary State Highway 3, was incorporated into the national highway system in 1926 as part of US 410 between Yakima and Pasco. The Columbia Trail portion of US 410 was paved in concrete by the Benton County government in 1932, constituting the region's first paved highway. The road along Cold Creek was closed in November 1943 as part of the establishment of a federal weapons development facility at the Hanford Site during World War II. To serve the new facility and evacuate residents in the event of an emergency, a four-lane highway bypassing Richland to the west was constructed by the county government in July 1948, connecting to US 410 with a new bridge over the Yakima River that was built by the Atomic Energy Commission. The remaining stretch of US 410 was moved to an expressway connecting with the new Pioneer Memorial Bridge, which opened on July 30, 1954. A section of the Richland Bypass Highway, opened in 1948 and later incorporated into SR 240, as seen from SR 224 The southern section of the Richland bypass, terminating near Hanford, was designated as Secondary State Highway 3R (SSH 3R) in 1953 and extended west via modern SR 224 to Kiona two years later. Shortly after the Atomic Energy Commission approved preliminary plans for a state highway across part of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in 1959, the state legislature designated it as Secondary State Highway 11C (SSH 11C) and allocated gas tax funds to construct it, despite opposition from Yakima legislators. Under the state law, passed despite opposition from Yakima legislators, SSH 11C would not be built until a bridge replacing the Vernita ferry was ready for traffic. The highway was rebuilt at a cost of $770,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars) and opened on July 14, 1965, linking Richland to the nearly-complete Vernita Bridge. An additional of the highway, bypassing the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in North Richland, opened on June 20, 1968. SR 240 was created during the 1964 state highway renumbering as part of the new sign route system, replacing SSH 11C and the eastern section of SSH 3R. The Richland‚ÄìKennewick freeway was renumbered in 1967 after US 12 was extended west to replace portions of US 410. US 12 was then moved onto the newly-completed I-182 in the 1985 and SR 240 was extended east to a junction with the relocated US 395 in Kennewick. The Richland Bypass was also widened from two lanes to five in 1980, at a cost of $1.83 million. The population of the Tri-Cities region grew substantially in the late 20th century, causing increased traffic congestion on the urban sections of SR 240\\\\. A $58 million highway widening program was completed in 2007 by WSDOT, expanding SR 240 to six lanes between Stevens Drive and Columbia Center Boulevard. The Yakima River Bridge was demolished in 2004 and replaced by a set of two bridges carrying three lanes each, as well as a multi-use bicycle and pedestrian trail. The western portion of the Columbia River Trail interchange at the Richland Wye was converted into a roundabout that opened to traffic in June 2007. A separate $16 million project completed in November 2009 converted the cloverleaf interchange at US 395 into a dogbone interchange with two roundabouts to improve safety and traffic flow. Due to remaining congestion issues on the Bypass Highway, WSDOT is considering several strategies to increase capacity, including reversible lanes, high-occupancy vehicle lanes, and opening the shoulder to traffic during peak periods. Long-term plans from the City of Richland propose the conversion of the Bypass into a full freeway with interchanges and right-in/right-out access to replace existing intersections. Major intersections Business route State Route 240 Business (SR 240 Bus.) is a business route of State Route 240 within the city of Richland. It travels north‚Äìsouth through the city's main commercial center, primarily on George Washington Way and Jadwin Avenue, from the eastern interchange with I-182 to the Stevens Drive intersection at the north end of the Richland Bypass. The northbound lanes continue on George Washington Way and travel west on McMurray Street before joining Jadwin Avenue, while the southbound lanes stay on Jadwin Avenue until it intersects George Washington Way near Howard Amon Park. Sections of George Washington Way carry a daily average of 42,000 vehicles and are also listed as part of the National Highway System.

The Orion VI was intended to provide an alternative to the existing high-floor Orion V; both the V and VI were replaced by the partially low-floor Orion VII (introduced in 2001). Unlike competing low-floor buses, which package the drivetrain components in an rear underfloor compartment, resulting in a step and raised floor near the rear axle, the Orion VI had its drivetrain in a compartment occupying the rear corner of the bus, with the low floor extending all the way back to the rear of the bus. In addition, the Orion VI was the first North American bus to be offered with a hybrid powertrain option, in 1998. Design Orion Bus Industries (OBI) introduced the Orion VI at the American Public Transit Association Expo in 1993. The two-piece windshield of the Orion VI, similar to the design of the Orion V and first- generation Orion VII, has the driver's windshield canted towards the back of the bus to reduce reflections. The bus was offered with up to three side doors, and with a choice of Diesel or compressed natural gas (CNG) engines. The engine compartment of the Orion VI completely occupies the rear corner on the driver's side of the bus. Guelph; the engine compartment is in the rear driver's-side corner of the bus. The layout of a typical North American low- floor transit bus has the low floor over most of the interior, extending from the front door to the rear door; behind the rear door, steps lead up to an elevated section to provide clearance for the engine and rear axle. The Orion VI offered a \\"true\\" or \\"full\\" low-floor, in which the low floor covers the entire length. Although the bus offered more overall capacity (including standees) than the competing New Flyer D40LF, which used the typical partial low-floor layout, the D40LF had approximately 10% more seats, as the Orion VI offered very few seats behind the rear axle. In a study performed by New York City Transit, the Orion VI had the fewest seats (28) compared with a New Flyer D40LF (39) and a conventional RTS bus (40); despite the ease of entry and exit, customers felt the low-floor bus had the least room and preferred the RTS. Part A, pp. 1‚Äì46 Part B, pp. 47‚Äì68 & Appendices The Orion VI uses a welded semi-monocoque steel frame clad with aluminum and fiberglass panels. The interior floor height is , corresponding to the first step height of the front door ( when knelt) and for the rear step height. To facilitate the full low-floor design, the suspension features an independent front design using MacPherson struts and an inverted rear portal axle. OBI marketed the Orion VI to both the Canadian and United States transit markets. Canadian buses were assembled at the OBI plant in Mississauga, Ontario. For the US market, to meet 'Buy America' requirements for federally subsidized transit vehicles, the Orion VI was partially assembled at Mississauga, then shipped to Oriskany, New York for final assembly by wholly owned subsidiary Bus Industries of America (BIA). Internally, OBI designated the bus model as 06.501. =Hybrid= A prototype series hybrid bus was developed by the New York State Consortium using an Orion V 40' chassis equipped with powertrain components supplied by General Electric. This hybrid bus prototype used tandem rear axles driven by four traction motors, one for each wheel. Electric traction power was generated by a Cummins B5.9 diesel engine rated at driving a alternator, and energy from regenerative braking was stored in nickel-cadmium batteries. In 1998, the Orion VI became the first North American transit bus to be offered with a hybrid powertrain as a regular production option. The New York City (NYC) Metropolitan Transportation Authority was the lead customer, with an order of 125 Orion VI Hybrid buses planned for delivery in 2002. The series hybrid powertrain, developed from the Orion V prototype by Lockheed Martin and marketed as HybriDrive‚Ñ¢, differed in adopting a single rear axle driven by one traction motor, storing energy in lead-acid batteries, and using a Detroit Diesel S30 (a co-branded Navistar 444) V-8 diesel engine turning a generator. A pilot fleet of 10 Orion VI Hybrid buses was sold in 1998 to MTA for $5.6 million. During durability testing at Altoona, Pennsylvania, the roof-mounted battery packs failed shortly after the bus was received, resulting in a prolonged unavailability of more than 1000 hours, and the traction motor failed three times. Deployment The Orion VI was mostly sold in Canada. Major transit agency users included New York City (MTA) and Toronto (TTC). TTC retired its Orion VI fleet in 2006 after less than ten years of service. The Orion VI for TTC had been purchased with CNG engines, and rather than convert them to diesel (as it was doing with the preceding Orion V fleet), TTC opted to retire the buses. Several Orion VI buses caught fire (WMATA, 2012; LACMTA, 2018) resulting in the idling of the entire Orion VI fleet for those transit agencies. The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also received separate complaints of tires catching fire in Arlington Heights, Illinois (2004) and Birmingham, Alabama (2005). In addition, a loose hydraulic pump fitting resulted in an engine fire for WMATA in 2010.

He was the first member of the U.S. Army to be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions performed in Southeast Asia while in captivity. Remarks by the President Bush at the Presentation of the Medal of Honor in the East Room of the White House. Early years Humbert Roque Versace was born in Honolulu, Hawaii on July 2, 1937. He was the eldest of five children born to Marie Teresa R√≠os (1917‚Äì1999)‚Äîthe author of three books, including the Fifteenth Pelican, on which The Flying Nun (starring Sally Field), the TV series of the 1960s, was based‚Äîand Colonel Humbert Joseph Versace (1911‚Äì1972). Versace grew up in Alexandria, Virginia and attended Gonzaga College High School in Washington, D.C. during his freshman and sophomore years. His junior year he attended Frankfurt American High School in Germany. He graduated from Norfolk Catholic High School in his senior year. He joined the Armed Forces in Norfolk, Virginia. As had his father before him, Versace entered the United States Military Academy West Point. He graduated in 1959 and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of Armor in the U.S. Army. He was a member of Ranger Class 4‚Äì60 and was awarded the Ranger Tab on December 18, 1959. Upon graduation from Ranger School, Capt. Versace attended Airborne School and was awarded the parachutist badge. He then served with 3rd Battalion, 40th Armor, 1st Cavalry Division in the Republic of Korea as an M-48 tank platoon leader from March 1960 to April 1961. Captain Versace was then assigned to the 3d U.S. Infantry (Old Guard), where he served as a tank platoon leader in Headquarters and Headquarters Company. After volunteering for duty in Vietnam, he attended the Military Assistance Institute, the Intelligence course at Fort Holabird, Maryland, and the USACS Vietnamese language Course at the Presidio of Monterey. Vietnam War On May 12, 1962, Versace began his first tour of duty in the Republic of Vietnam as an intelligence advisor. In May 1963 he volunteered for a six-month extension of his tour, planning to attend seminary at the conclusion of his service and join the Catholic priesthood, hoping to return to Vietnam as a missionary working with orphans. Less than two weeks before the end of his tour, on October 29, 1963, while visiting a Military Academy classmate in Detachment A-23, 5th Special Forces Group in the Mekong Delta, Versace accompanied several companies of South Vietnamese Civilian Irregular Defense (CIDG) troops who had attacked to remove a Viet Cong command post located in the U Minh Forest, a VC stronghold. A VC Main Force battalion ambushed and overran Versace's unit, wounding him in the process. He was able to provide enough covering fire so that the CIDG forces could withdraw from the killing zone. A second government force of about 200 men operating only a few thousand yards from the main fight learned of the disaster too late to help. U.S. authorities said the communist radio jammers had knocked out both the main channel and the alternate channel on all local military radios. Versace was captured and taken to a prison deep in the jungle along with two other Americans, Lieutenant Nick Rowe and Sergeant Dan Pitzer. He tried to escape four times, but failed in his attempts. Versace insulted the Viet Cong during the indoctrination sessions and cited the Geneva Convention treaty time after time. The Viet Cong separated Versace from the other prisoners. The last time the prisoners heard his voice, he was loudly singing \\"God Bless America\\". On September 26, 1965, North Vietnam's \\"Liberation Radio\\" announced the execution of Captain Humbert Roque Versace. Versace's remains have never been recovered. His headstone at Arlington National Cemetery stands above an empty grave and can be located in the Memorial section MG-108. Upon learning of their son's fate, Marie Teresa Rios Versace and her husband, Colonel Versace, tried to find out what they could about the circumstances. She went to Paris in the late 1960s, trying unsuccessfully to see the North Vietnamese delegation as it arrived for peace talks. Rios Versace expressed her frustration and anguish in poems. Nominations to award Versace the Medal of Honor were initiated in 1969, but the nomination failed and he was posthumously awarded the Silver Star instead. The quest for a Medal of Honor for Versace languished until the \\"Friends of Rocky Versace\\" reinitiated the crusade once more in 1999. Language added by Congress in the 2002 Defense Authorization Act ended the standoff and authorized the award of the nation's highest military decoration for combat valor to Versace. On July 8, 2002, in a ceremony in the White House East Room, Versace was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President George W. Bush for his heroism, the first time an Army POW had been awarded the nation's highest honor for actions in captivity. Present were his surviving siblings, Dr. Stephen Versace, Richard (former coach of the Indiana Pacers), Michael and Trilby Versace. On November 7, 2008, the Department of the Army announced the revocation of Versace's Silver Star because it was upgraded to the Medal of Honor.

There is a statue with the likeness of Versace in the Plaza, which was made possible with a donation of $125,000 raised by the citizens of Alexandria, Virginia. On July 9, 2002, the day after the White House Medal of Honor ceremony, Secretary of the Army Thomas E. White and Army Chief of Staff General Eric K. Shinseki inducted Versace into the Pentagon Hall of Heroes. In 2003, he was inducted into the Military Intelligence Corps Hall of Fame. The Military Intelligence Hall of Fame is a Hall of Fame established by the Military Intelligence Corps of the United States Army in 1988 to honor soldiers and civilians who have made exceptional contributions to Military Intelligence.

Previously he was Executive Secretary of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) from 1997 to 2002. Background and earlier career Kouyat√© was born in Koba, Guinea, then a French colony. He studied administration at the University of Conakry before joining the civil service. In 1976, he was appointed as Director of Labour, then the following year, moved to become Director of Trade, Prices and Statistics, where he had responsibility for state-owned companies. In 1982, Kouyat√© worked on a rice development project, then moved to the diplomatic service, joining Guinea's delegation in Cote d'Ivoire. In 1985, he returned to the Foreign Ministry in Conakry as head of African and Organisation of African Unity affairs. Two years later, he became Guinea's ambassador to Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Sudan, Syria and Turkey. In 1992, he became Guinea's Permanent Representative at the United Nations, where he became Vice President of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. In 1993, he was appointed as the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Somalia for the UNOSOM II mission, then in February 1994 became the Acting Representative. In June 1994, he became the Assistant Secretary-General in the UN Department of Political Affairs, one of his first missions being a tour around ECOWAS member states to discuss the situation in Liberia. He continued his involvement in discussions to build regional support for a resolution of the First Liberian Civil War. He left this job in September 1997 to become the Executive Secretary of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a post he held until February 2002. During his time at ECOWAS, Kouyat√© was awarded the Legion d'Honneur (Commander), the African Star of Liberia and was made a Commander of the Mono Order of Togo. Prime Minister As a result of a general strike in early 2007, Kouyat√© was nominated for the post of Prime Minister of Guinea on 26 February 2007. He was selected by President Lansana Cont√© from a list provided by trade union leaders.\\"Guineans back to work after deal\\", BBC News, 27 February 2007. On 1 March, he was sworn in as Prime Minister at a ceremony in Conakry; Cont√© was not present.\\"Kouyate takes his oath in Conakry\\", AFP (IOL), 2 March 2007. His government was named on 28 March, composed of 19 ministers and three secretaries of state; it contained none of the members of the old government.\\"Guinea PM appoints new government\\", Al Jazeera, 29 March 2007. On 5 December 2007, a decree restructuring ministries increased the powers of the Secretary-General of the Presidency at the expense of those of the Prime Minister, and on 3 January 2008 Cont√© dismissed and replaced Justin Morel Junior, the Minister of Communication and Government Spokesman, without consulting Kouyat√©. On 4 January, Kouyat√© demanded that Morel be restored to his position and said that he would not sit at the Council of Ministers with Morel's replacement. Labor unions announced plans to begin a new \\"unlimited general strike\\" on 10 January, demanding that Cont√©'s agreement with the unions be properly implemented and that Morel be restored.\\"Tensions en Guin√©e: pr√©avis de gr√®ve g√©n√©rale √† partir du 10 janvier\\", AFP, 4 January 2008 .

Kouyat√© was widely considered a disappointment in his role as Prime Minister, and his unpopularity meant that his dismissal was not greeted with major unrest of the kind that led to his appointment a year earlier; in particular, his time in office was associated with rising food prices, deepening the country's economic problems. He was also accused of having presidential ambitions. Because he had not consulted with the opposition when forming his government and had not invited opposition politicians to participate in it, the opposition welcomed his dismissal and urged Souar√© to avoid his mistakes.

History The venue opened as \\"Tri-City Stadium\\" for the Tri-City Posse, a charter member of the independent Western Baseball League (WBL). After six years, the Posse left after the 2000 season when the NWL Rockies moved up the Columbia River from Portland to become the Tri-City Dust Devils for 2001. (The Rockies moved to make way for a new incarnation of the Beavers in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League.) It was renamed \\"Dust Devils Stadium\\" in 2004 and became Gesa Stadium in 2008, when Gesa Credit Union, a local financial institution, announced that they had purchased the naming rights to the facility for a duration of ten years.KNDU Video In early 2007, the stadium underwent a renovation, which a sunshade was constructed on the northwest-side of the stadium behind the right-field stands, to help shade spectators on the left-field stands from the glare of the setting sun. Gesa Stadium has an unorthodox southern alignment, so that fans could have sight of the Kennewick area and the surrounding Horse Heaven Hills, particularly Jump Off Joe. The recommended alignment of a baseball diamond (home plate to center field) is east-northeast. The elevation of the playing field is approximately above sea level and is just north of Interstate 182, several miles west of the Tri-Cities Airport. Previous venues The previous ballparks for minor league baseball in the area were in the other two cities, and both were aligned northeast. Sanders-Jacobs Field (1950‚Äì1974) in Kennewick was located at the northeast corner of Clearwater Avenue and Neel Street in the West Highlands (). Used for a quarter century, its third base line followed present-day Morain Street. It was named for Harry Sanders, a Connell farmer, and Tom Jacobs, a former manager and the general manager of the Atoms at the time of his death at age 64 in 1968. The independent Tri-City Ports folded after the 1974 season, and the venue was demolished soon after. In Richland, the baseball field at Richland High School, adjacent to the Bomber Bowl, was used for the Tri-Cities Triplets' four seasons in the mid-1980s. The team was sold after the 1986 season, moved to southwestern Idaho, and became the Boise Hawks.

M. gigas is native to the Sonoran desert at elevations below 4900 feet (1500m). The front wings of these beetles are fused forming a single, hardened shell, from which the genus derives its Latin name. The genus includes twenty species. Longhorn cactus beetles feed on chollas and prickly pear cacti, and are known to feed on saguaro seedlings. Larvae bore into cactus roots and stems, sometimes killing more susceptible individuals. Adults also feed on the surface of cacti. Most Moneilema species are active during mid or late summer - the adults typically emerging during the summer monsoon season. Some Moneilema species in central and southern Mexico are reported to be active all year. Like many flightless beetles, these beetles have limited wing musculature with a rounded abdomen and thorax, similar in appearance to a number of other flightless desert beetles. Cactus longhorn beetles resemble and mimic the behavior of noxious stink beetles in the genus Eleodes.

Studio monitors are loudspeakers in speaker enclosures specifically designed for professional audio production applications, such as recording studios, filmmaking, television studios, radio studios and project or home studios, where accurate audio reproduction is crucial. Among audio engineers, the term monitor implies that the speaker is designed to produce relatively flat (linear) phase and frequency responses. In other words, it exhibits minimal emphasis or de-emphasis of particular frequencies, the loudspeaker gives an accurate reproduction of the tonal qualities of the source audio (\\"uncolored\\" or \\"transparent\\" are synonyms), and there will be no relative phase shift of particular frequencies‚Äîmeaning no distortion in sound-stage perspective for stereo recordings. Beyond stereo sound-stage requirements, a linear phase response helps impulse response remain true to source without encountering \\"smearing\\". An unqualified reference to a monitor often refers to a near-field (compact or close-field) design. This is a speaker small enough to sit on a stand or desk in proximity to the listener, so that most of the sound that the listener hears is coming directly from the speaker, rather than reflecting off of walls and ceilings (and thus picking up coloration and reverberation from the room). Monitor speakers may include more than one type of driver (e.g., a tweeter and a woofer) or, for monitoring low-frequency sounds, such as bass drum, additional subwoofer cabinets may be used. There are studio monitors designed for mid- field or far-field use as well. These tend to be used in film scoring environments, where simulation of larger sized areas like theaters is important. Also, studio monitors are made in a more physically robust manner than home hi-fi loudspeakers; whereas home hi-fi loudspeakers often only have to reproduce compressed commercial recordings, studio monitors have to cope with the high volumes and sudden sound bursts that may happen in the studio when playing back unmastered mixes. Uses Quested HM412 main monitor, Studio 9000, PatchWerk Recording Studios A near-field passive studio monitor by Amphion Loudspeakers Broadcasting and recording organisations employ audio engineers who use loudspeakers to assess the aesthetic merits of the programme and to tailor the balance by audio mixing and mastering to achieve the desired end result. Loudspeakers are also required at various points in the audio processing chain to enable engineers to ensure that the programme is reasonably free from technical defects, such as audible distortion or background noise.\\"The Development of High-Quality Monitoring Loudspeakers: A Review of Progress\\" (Expanded Version of I.EoE. Paper Read on 23 April 1958). Report No. L-041 (1958/31), The British Broadcasting Corporation The engineer may mix programming that will sound pleasing on the widest range of playback systems used by regular listeners (i.e. high-end audio, low-quality radios in clock radios and \\"boom boxes\\", in club PA systems, in a car stereo or a home stereo). While some broadcasters like the BBC generally believe in using monitors of \\"the highest practicable standard of performance\\", some audio engineers argue that monitoring should be carried out with loudspeakers of mediocre technical quality to be representative of the regular systems end- users are likely to be listening with; or that some technical defects are apparent only with high-grade reproducing equipment and therefore can be ignored. However, as a public broadcaster dealing with a lot of live material, the BBC holds the view that studio monitors should be \\"as free as possible from avoidable defects\\". It is argued that real life low-grade sound systems are so different that it would be impossible to compensate for the characteristics of every type of system available; technical faults must not be apparent to even a minority of listeners while remaining undetected by the operating staff. It is further argued that, because of technical progress in the science of sound transmission, equipment in the studio originating the programme should have a higher standard of performance than the equipment employed in reproducing it, since the former has a longer life. In fact, most professional audio production studios have several sets of monitors spanning the range of playback systems in the market. This may include a sampling of large, expensive speakers as may be used in movie theatres, hi-fi style speakers, car speakers, portable music systems, PC speakers and consumer-grade headphones. Amplification: Studio monitors may be \\"active\\" (including one or more internal power amplifier(s)), or passive (these require an external power amplifier). Active models are usually bi-amplified, which means that the input sound signal is divided into two parts by an active crossover for low and high frequency components. Both parts are amplified using separate low- and high- frequency amplifiers, and then the low-frequency part is routed to a woofer and the high-frequency part is routed to a tweeter or horn. Bi-amplification is done so that a cleaner overall sound reproduction can be obtained, since signals are easier to process before power amplification. Consumer loudspeakers may or may not have these various design goals. History =1920s and 1930s= In the early years of the recording industry in the 1920s and 1930s, studio monitors were used primarily to check for noise interference and obvious technical problems rather than for making artistic evaluations of the performance and recording. Musicians were recorded live and the producer judged the performance on this basis, relying on simple tried- and-true microphone techniques to ensure that it had been adequately captured; playback through monitors was used simply to check that no obvious technical flaws had spoiled the original recording. As a result, early monitors tended to be basic loudspeaker cabinets. The state-of-the-art loudspeakers of the era were massive horn-loaded systems which were mostly used in cinemas. High-end loudspeaker design grew out of the demands of the motion picture industry and most of the early loudspeaker pioneers worked in Los Angeles where they attempted to solve the problems of cinema sound. Stereophonic sound was in its infancy, having been pioneered in Britain by an engineer who worked for EMI. Designing monitors for recording studios was not a major priority. =1940s and 1950s= The first high-quality loudspeaker developed expressly as a studio monitor was the Altec Lansing Duplex 604 in 1944. This innovative driver has historically been regarded as growing out of the work of James Bullough Lansing who had previously supplied the drivers for the Shearer Horn in 1936, a speaker that had rapidly become the industry standard in motion- picture sound. He had also designed the smaller Iconic and this was widely employed at the time as a motion-picture studio monitor. The 604 was a relatively compact coaxial design and within a few years it became the industry standard in the United States, a position it maintained in its various incarnations (the 604 went through eleven model-changes) over the next 25 years. It was common in US studios throughout the 1950s and 60s and remained in continuous production until 1998. Siemens Recording Studio ca. 1956 as seen in the Deutsches Museum in Munich Germany. In the UK, Tannoy introduced its own coaxial design, the Dual Concentric, and this assumed the same reference role in Europe as the Altec 604 held in the US. The British Broadcasting Corporation researchers conducted evaluations on as many speakers as they could obtain in around 1948, but found commercial loudspeaker makers had little to offer that met their requirements. The BBC needed speakers that worked well with program material within real professional and domestic settings environments, and not just fulfil technical measurements such as frequency-response, distortion, monitors in anechoic chambers. Above all, the BBC required monitors to sound balanced, be neutral in tone, and lack colouration.Seydor, Paul. \\"The BBC Monitor\\". The Absolute Sound's Illustrated History of High-End Audio p.306 Monitor usage in the industry was highly conservative, with almost monopolistic reliance on industry \\"standards\\", in spite of the sonic failings of these aging designs. The Altec 604 had a notoriously ragged frequency response but almost all U.S studios continued to use it because virtually every producer and engineer knew its sound intimately and were practiced at listening through its sonic limitations. Recording through unfamiliar monitors, no matter how technically advanced, was hazardous because engineers unfamiliar with their sonic signatures could make poor production decisions and it was financially unviable to give production staff expensive studio time to familiarize themselves with new monitors. As a result, pretty well every U.S studio had a set of 604's and every European studio a Tannoy Dual Concentric or two. However, in 1959, at the height of its industry dominance, Altec made the mistake of replacing the 604 with the 605A Duplex, a design widely regarded as inferior to its predecessor. There was a backlash from some record companies and studios and this allowed Altec's competitor, JBL (a company originally started by 604 designer James B. Lansing), to make inroads into the pro monitor market. Capitol Records replaced their Altecs with JBL D50 Monitors and a few years later their UK affiliate, EMI, also made the move to JBL's. Although Altec re-introduced the 604 as the \\"E\\" version Super Duplex in response to the criticism, they now had a major industry rival to contend with. Over the next decade most of the developments in studio monitor design originated from JBL. As the public broadcaster in the UK, the BBC had the determinant role in defining industry standards. Its renowned research departments invested considerable resources in determining studio monitor suited to their different broadcasting needs, and also created their own models from first principles. A 1958 research paper identified the sound goal, in a monaural system: > It is assumed that the ideal to be aimed at in the design of a sound > reproducing system is realism, i.e. that the listener should be able to > imagine himself to be in the presence of the original source of sound. There > is, of course, scope for legitimate experiment in the processing of the > reproduced signals in an endeavour to improve on nature, however, realism, > or as near an approach to it as may be possible, ought surely to be regarded > as the normal condition and avoidable departures from this state, while > justified upon occasion, should not be allowed to become a permanent feature > of the system. In designing a loudspeaker, the BBC established the compromise that had to be established between size, weight and cost considerations. Two-way designs were preferred due to the inherently simpler crossover network, but were subject to the limitations of speaker driver technology at the time - there were few high-frequency units available at the time that functioned down to 1.5 kHz, meaning that the woofer must operate in a predictable manner up to about 2 kHz.\\"The Design of the Studio Monitoring Loudspeakers Types LS5/5 and LS5/6\\". Report No. PH13 (1967/57), November 1967, The British Broadcasting Corporation The BBC developed a two-way studio monitor in 1959, the LS5/1, using a 58mm Celestion tweeter and 380mm Goodmans bass unit, but continually had problems with consistency of the bass units. The successful testing of a 305mm bass cone made with new thermoplastics led to development and deployment of the LS5/5 and LS5/6 monitors that occupied only 60% volume of its predecessor. As recording became less and less \\"live\\" and multi-tracking and overdubbing became the norm, the studio monitor became far more crucial to the recording process. When there was no original performance outside what existed on the tape, the monitor became the touchstone of all engineering and production decisions. As a result, accuracy and transparency became paramount and the conservatism evident in the retention of the 604 as the standard for over twenty years began to give way to fresh technological development. Despite this, the 604 continued to be widely used - mainly because many engineers and producers were so familiar with their sonic signature that they were reluctant to change. =1960s and 1970s= In a BBC white paper published in January 1963, the authors explored two-channel stereophony, and remarked that it was at a disadvantage compared with multi-channel stereophony that was already available in cinemas in that \\"the full intended effects is apparent only to observers located within in a restricted area in front of the loudspeakers\\". The authors expressed reservations about dispersion and directionality in 2-channel systems, noting that the \\"face-to-face listening arrangement\\" was not able to give an acceptable presentation for a centrally-located observer in a domestic setting.\\"The Influence of Loudspeaker Directivity and Orientation on the Effective Audience Area in Two-Channel Stereophonic Reproduction\\", BBC Engineering Division, January 1963. The paper concluded: > The achievement of suitable directional characteristics within the aesthetic > and economic limitations applying to domestic equipment will however require > a much greater research effort than either the corporation or the radio > industry have so far been able to devote to the subject. To complement its larger two-way monitors for studio use, the BBC developed a small speaker for near-field monitoring of the frequency range from 400 Hz to about 20 kHz for its outside broadcasting monitoring. The principal constraints were space and situations where using headphones is unsatisfactory, such as in mobile broadcasting vans. Based on scaling tests done in 1968, and detailed audio work against the LS5/8 ‚Äì a large \\"Grade I monitor\\" already in use at the time ‚Äì and with live sources, the BBC Research Department developed the LS3/5, which became the famous LS3/5A that was used from 1975 to much of the 1990s and beyond by the BBC and audiophiles alike.Prakel, David (August 1979). \\"BBC's Home Service\\", Hi-Fi Answers, pp67-9 (Courtesy link)H.D. Harwood, BSc, M.E. Whatton, C.Eng., M.I.E.E. and R.W. Mills. (October 1976) \\"The design of the miniature monitoring loudspeaker type LS3/5A\\", Research Department, Engineering Division, The British Broadcasting CorporationAtkinson, John (April 2007). \\"Stirling LS3/5a V2, 2007\\". Stereophile (Vol.30 No.4). In the late 1960s JBL introduced two monitors which helped secure them pre-eminence in the industry. The 4320 was a direct competitor to the Altec 604 but was a more accurate and powerful speaker and it quickly made inroads against the industry standard. However, it was the more compact 4310 that revolutionized monitoring by introducing the idea of close or \\"nearfield\\" monitoring. (The sound field very close to a sound source is called the \\"near-field.\\" By \\"very close\\" is meant in the predominantly direct, rather than reflected, sound field. A near-field speaker is a compact studio monitor designed for listening at close distances (), so, in theory, the effects of poor room acoustics are greatly reduced.) The 4310 was small enough to be placed on the recording console and listened to from much closer distances than the traditional large wall-(or \\"soffit\\") mounted main monitors. As a result, studio-acoustic problems were minimized. Smaller studios found the 4310 ideal and that monitor and its successor, the 4311, became studio fixtures throughout the 1970s. Ironically, the 4310 had been designed to replicate the sonic idiosyncrasies of the Altec 604 but in a smaller package to cater for the technical needs of the time. The 4311 was so popular with professionals that JBL introduced a domestic version for the burgeoning home- audio market. This speaker, the JBL L-100, (or \\"Century\\") was a massive success and became the biggest-selling hi-fi speaker ever within a few years. By 1975, JBL overtook Altec as the monitor of choice for most studios. The major studios continued to use huge designs mounted on the wall which were able to produce prodigious SPL's and amounts of bass. This trend reached its zenith with The Who's use of a dozen JBL 4350 monitors, each capable of 125 dB and containing two fifteen-inch woofers and a twelve-inch mid-bass driver. Most studios, however, also used more modest monitoring devices to check how recordings would sound through car speakers and cheap home systems. A favourite \\"grot-box\\" monitor employed in this way was the Auratone 5C, a crude single-driver device that gave a reasonable facsimile of typical lo-fi sound. However, a backlash against the behemoth monitor was soon to take place. With the advent of punk, new wave, indie, and lo-fi, a reaction to high-tech recording and large corporate-style studios set in and do-it-yourself recording methods became the vogue. Smaller, less expensive, recording studios needed smaller, less expensive monitors and the Yamaha NS-10, a design introduced in 1978 ironically for the home audio market, became the monitor of choice for many studios in the 1980s.Phil Ward, \\"The Yamaha NS10 Story\\". Sound on Sound, September 2008 While its sound-quality has often been derided, even by those who monitor through it, the NS-10 continues in use to this day and many more successful recordings have been produced with its aid over the past twenty five years than with any other monitor.Gardiner, Bryan (15 September 2010). \\"Yamaha's NS-10: The Most Important Speaker You've Never Heard Of\\". GizmodoPR Newell, KR Holland & JP Newell. \\"The Yamaha NS10M: Twenty Years a Reference Monitor. Why?\\". report commissioned by Sound on Sound =1980s‚Äì1990s= Tannoy, Dynaudio, Genelec, and K+H studio monitors. By the mid-1980s the near-field monitor had become a permanent fixture. The larger studios still had large soffit-mounted main monitors but producers and engineers spent most of their time working with near-fields. Common large monitors of the time were Eastlake / Westlake monitors with twin 15\\" bass units, a wooden midrange horn and a horn-loaded tweeter. The UREI 813 was also popular. Based on the almost ageless Altec 604 with a Time-Align passive crossover network developed by Ed Long, it included delay circuitry to align the acoustic centers of the low and high-frequency components. Fostex \\"Laboratory Series\\" monitors were used in a few high-end studios, but with increasing costs of manufacture, they became rare. The once dominant JBL fell gradually into disfavour. One of the most striking trends was the growth of soft-dome monitors. These operated without horn-loaded drivers. Horns, while having advantages in transient response and efficiency, tend to be hard to listen to over long periods. The lack of distortion of high-end dome midrange & tweeters made them easy to work with all day (and night). Typical soft-dome systems were made by Roger Quested, ATC, Neil Grant and PMC and were actively driven by racks of active crossovers and amplifiers. Other monitor and studio designers like Tom Hidley, Phil Newall and Sam Toyoshima continued research into the speaker/room interface and led developments in room design, trapping, absorption and diffusion to create a consistent and neutral monitoring environment. =2000s= Bruce Gil in a mastering studio (a near-field studio monitor can be seen on the left. The main post-NS-10 trend has been the almost universal acceptance of powered monitors where the speaker enclosure contains the driving amplifiers. Passive monitors require outboard power amplifiers to drive them as well as speaker wire to connect them. Powered monitors, by contrast, are comparatively more convenient and streamlined single units, which in addition, marketeers claim a number of technical advantages. The interface between speaker and amplifier can be optimized, possibly offering greater control and precision, and advances in amplifier design have reduced the size and weight of the electronics significantly. The result has been that passive monitors have become far less common than powered monitors in project and home studios. In the 2000s, there was a trend to focus on \\"translation\\". Engineers tended to choose monitors less for their accuracy than for their ability to \\"translate\\" ‚Äì to make recordings sound good on a variety of playback systems, from stock car radios and standard boom boxes to esoteric audiophile systems. As the mix engineer Chris Lord-Alge has noted: :Ninety- five percent of people listen to music in their car or on a cheap home stereo; 5 percent may have better systems; and maybe 1 percent have a $20,000 stereo. So if it doesn't sound good on something small, what's the point? You can mix in front of these huge, beautiful, pristine, $10,000 powered monitors all you want. But no one else has these monitors, so you're more likely to end up with a translation problem.\\"Knave, Brian (1 June 2001) \\"Good References\\", emusician. But it is uncertain just what tools aid translation. Some producers argue that accuracy is still the best guarantee. If a producer or audio engineer is listening to recorded tracks and mixing tracks using a \\"flattering\\" monitor speaker, they may miss subtle problems in the mic'ing or recording quality that a more precise monitor would expose. Other producers feel that monitors should mimic home audio and car speakers, as this is what most consumers listen to music on. Still more believe that monitors need to be relentlessly unflattering, so that the producer and engineer must work hard to make recordings sound good. Comparison with hi-fi speakers Late model (c.1998) BBC LS3/5A manufactured under license by Spendor No speaker, monitor or hi-fi sound system, regardless of the design principle or cost, has a completely flat frequency response; all speakers color the sound to some degree. Monitor speakers are assumed to be as free as possible from coloration. While no rigid distinction exists between consumer speakers and studio monitors, manufacturers more and more accent the difference in their marketing material. Generally, studio monitors are physically robust, to cope with the high volumes and physical knocks that may happen in the studio, and are used for listening at shorter distances (e.g., near field) than hi-fi speakers, though nothing precludes them from being used in a home-sized environment. In one prominent recording magazine, Sound on Sound, the number of self-amplified (active) studio monitor reviews significantly outweighs the number of passive monitor reviews over the past two decades indicating that studio monitors are predominantly self-amplified, although not exclusively so. Hi-fi speakers usually require external amplification. Monitors are used by almost all professional producers and audio engineers. The claimed advantage of studio monitors is that the production translates better to other sound systems.http://www.topstudiogear.com/difference-between-monitors-and-speakers/ In the 1970s, the JBL 4311's domestic equivalent, the L-100, was used in a large number of homes, while the Yamaha NS-10 served both domestically and professionally during the 1980s. Despite not being a \\"commercial product\\" at the outset, the BBC licensed production of the LS3/5A monitor, which it used internally. It was commercially successful in its twenty-something-year life,\\"A timeline of LS3/5A manufacture\\". Ls351.com from 1975 until approximately 1998. The diminutive BBC speaker has amassed an \\"enthusiastic, focused, and ... loyal following\\", according to Paul Seydor in The Absolute Sound. Estimates of their sales differ, but are generally in the 100,000 pairs ballpark.Seydor, Paul (2 December 2008). \\"Stirling Broadcast LS3/5a V2 Loudspeaker\\".

HiFi News (courtesy link to reproduced content) Professional audio companies such as Genelec, Neumann (formerly Klein + Hummel), Quested, and M & K sell almost exclusively to recording studios and record producers, who comprise key players in the professional monitor market. Most of the consumer audio manufacturers confine themselves to supplying speakers for home hi-fi systems. Companies that straddle both worlds, like Amphion Loudspeakers, ADAM, Dynaudio, Focal/JM Labs, JBL, PMC, surrounTec and Tannoy tend to clearly differentiate their monitor and hi-fi lines.

Prior to Jatta's work, these instruments were largely unknown outside the rural villages of the Senegambia region of West Africa. Contribution to knowledge of West African music In the 1960s, scholars and writers began to seriously examine the traditional music of West Africa in their search for the roots of the blues, jazz, and the other music forms that had emerged in the African diaspora. However, in this quest there was very little study and documentation of West African stringed instruments done other than in the overall context of general musical and cultural traditions. For the most part, the only stringed instruments to receive specific attention were those of the griots, such as their plucked lutes (e.g. the Mande ngoni, the Wolof xalam, the Fula hoddu, the Soninke gambare, and the kora (the 21-string harp-lute of the Mandinka griots). Griots are male members of hereditary music and word artisan castes found in certain West African Islamized peoples with similar tripartie caste systems. The griot phenomenon is limited to the various peoples of the Mande language family - some 53 related ethnic groups, such as the Bamana (or Bambara), Mandinka, Malinke, Susu, Soninke, and so on - as well as the non-Mande Wolof, the western Fulas or Fulani (; ), Songhai (also Songhay), Sereer, Lebu, and Tukul√≥or.) In 2000, Jatta presented his research findings and introduced the Jola akonting at the Third Annual Banjo Collectors Gathering, an annual international conference of the foremost collectors and scholars of 19th and early 20th century banjos. The annual Banjo Collectors Gatherings also serve as the principal forums for the presentations of new research on the banjo's history and organology. Jatta's presentation, in which he performed on the akonting and showed film footage of other Jola musicians playing the instrument, made for quite a sensation. Up until that point, the conventional wisdom was that the wooden- bodied plucked lutes exclusive to the West African griots, such as the Mande ngoni and the Wolof xalam, were the archetypes for the earliest forms of the banjo, first made and played by enslaved West Africans in the New World, from the 17th century on. Jatta's proposition that gourd-bodied non-griot folk and artisan lutes - like the Jola akonting (Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau), the Manjago buchundu (Gambia, Guinea-Bissau), the Gwari kaburu (Nigeria), and the Frafra koliko (Ghana), to name but a few - were the more likely candidates was revolutionary. Since then, many museums around the world have updated their collections to include the akonting and other members of the West African folk/artisan lute family, while banjo historians and ethnomusicologists have begun to broaden the range of their focus to include these instruments as well those used by griots.

BR216. In the same issue the book was included among seventy-five recommended titles selected by the Children's Editor of the newspaper's Book Review, described as an \\"[i]nformative, thoroughly enjoyable chronicle of the development of science in our country.\\"\\"Seventy-Five Recommended Titles,\\" New York Times, November 5, 1967, p. BR233. Publishers' Weekly stated that \\"[t]o read the index ... is to read the names of the men and of their discoveries in science in America, from the earliest days ... to the space age. To read the book is to become familiar with the men and their contributions to science.\\"\\"Other Science Topics,\\" Publishers' Weekly, November 13, 1967, p. 80. George Basalia, writing for Library Journal, called the book \\"a first-rate history of American science and technology for high-school students ... cover[ing] major American technical discoveries as well as our contributions to the purely theoretical aspects of science.\\" He found \\"much to be praised ... the book is intelligently conceived, carefully organized, clearly written, and handsomely designed.

Allen in the Montreal Gazette wrote that the book's story \\"makes fascinating reading,\\" and that \\"[w]hile the treatment of any one discipline may at first seem superficial and chatty, the total impact is most impressive, for the reader is left with an acquaintance with the leading figures of the age of science and some appreciation of how the contribution of each influenced a way of life.\\" He concluded \\"The breadth of scientific knowledge which this book represents is remarkable, as is the skill with which it has been set down and the effortlessness with which it reads.\\"\\"Books: Roster Of Science,\\" Montreal Gazette, January 27, 1968, p. 33.

Philip and Phylis Morrison in Scientific American felt it \\"manages to convey a sense of coherence, even though it deals at staccato length with so many men, trends and ideas ... The reason is partly in the expert writing smooth, unusually candid, cheerful and sometimes a bit condescending (as in the two or three pages about Veblen).\\" They add that \\"[n]ot all the dicta of the authors seem reasonable, but to find any personal judgment at work is so rare in this kind of pedagogy that one is pleased by the De Camps even when one disagrees with them.\\"\\"A Christmas selection of books on science for younger readers,\\" Scientific American, December 1968, p. 138.

Founded in 1997, the group consisted of lead singer Amanda Wilkinson, her brother Tyler Wilkinson, and their father, Steve Wilkinson. The Wilkinsons achieved success late in 1998 with the hit single \\"26 Cents\\", a Number One on the Canadian country music charts and Top 5 hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. It was followed by \\"Fly (The Angel Song)\\", also a No. 1 in Canada. A second album, Here and Now, produced the group's last American top 40 hit in \\"Jimmy's Got a Girlfriend\\". Afterward, the trio recorded three more albums, one of which was not released, and a Greatest Hits package. History =Beginnings= Steve Wilkinson was born on August 18, 1955 in Belleville, Ontario, Canada. Before the country trio was formed, he was struggling financially after he lost his job at a nuclear power plant due to downsizing. He took menial jobs in order to provide for his family, but his real passion was music. They signed to Giant Records in 1998. =Breakthrough= The Wilkinsons' first album, Nothing But Love, reached No. 16 on the Billboard Top Country Albums charts in 1998. The trio was nominated for the Country Music Association's Horizon Award and Vocal Group of the Year and for Single of the Year by the Academy of Country Music Awards. Their second album, Here and Now, won the Canadian Country Music Association award for Best Album. The band has received nine Canadian Country Music Awards, one Juno Award and two Grammy nominations (both for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group). =Move to BNA Records= In 2001, Giant closed its Nashville division while \\"I Wanna Be That Girl\\" was climbing, leading to the band's third Giant album (Shine) not being released. Shortly thereafter, the trio was signed to BNA Records. Weeks before the release of their first single for BNA, the label's president wanted Amanda to record a solo album, which would ultimately disband the trio. The trio eventually left the label and signed with the independent Canadian label Open Road Records for their 2005 album, Highway. =Solo work= Amanda Wilkinson signed with Universal South Records and released her solo debut album, Amanda Wilkinson. Amanda received four nominations at the 2006 Canadian Country Music Awards (Single of the Year, CMT Video of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, and Album of the Year). Tyler started the alternative rock band Motion Picture Ending. The band was composed of drummer and long-time friend Justin Devries, bassist Curtis Weekes, guitarist Greg Bolton, with Tyler as lead vocalist and guitarist. =Greatest Hits‚Ä¶ and Then Some= In 2007, The Wilkinsons won Independent Group of the Year at the Canadian Country Music Awards. Greatest Hits‚Ä¶ and Then Some, a greatest hits album, was released on October 7, 2008. The first single, \\"When I'm Old\\", was released in mid 2008. =Small Town Pistols= In the late 2000s, the Wilkinsons disbanded. Amanda and Tyler founded a new duo called Small Town Pistols in 2012. Reality television The Wilkinsons were also the subject of a fictionalized \\"reality\\" television program on the CMT Canada network, The Wilkinsons. The show follows the family as they move back to The Quinte Area, Ontario, from Nashville, Tennessee. In 2006, the show was nominated for Country Music Program or Special of the Year at the Canadian Country Music Awards.

Early life Ysatis was born in Athens, Greece, and developed an interest in the synthesizer through exposure to electronic music by artists such as Kraftwerk and Jean Michel Jarre in the late 1970s. At age 15, he left Greece to move to New York City, where he acquired some musical equipment and began experimenting. His early ambient solo work was produced under the moniker Omicron. He met and started working with Taylor Deupree in 1993 and released a number of albums and tracks, with a variety of styles and under a few different names. Ysatis and Deupree released their ambient work as Seti, their jazzy trip hop as Futique, and their more dance-oriented work as Arc. Most of Ysatis' work while in New York was released on the Instinct label. Recent activity In 1997, Ysatis returned to Athens to help the growing Greek electronic music scene. He founded the Sonar label with radio DJ Giannis Papaioannou. He also started the Allou project with vocalist Elias Aslanoglou, which has signed with the V2 label. Musical style Ysatis' early work, as characterized by his Omicron releases, and his work with Deupree for SETI, focused mainly on ambient music. The Futique project was a completely different combination of trip hop and jazz. The Arc project fit somewhere between the two other projects, with a stripped-down Detroit techno style, with a little experimental edge. His latest solo work on the Tresor label moves to a classic techno feel.

The organization started in 1923, as the \\"Union of Young Russia\\" (in Russian: –°–æ—é–∑ –ú–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–π –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, Soyuz Molodoi Rossii) in Munich, changing its name to the Union of Mladorossi in 1925.  Early years  The Mladorossi (), as they were popularly known, at first declared themselves as anti-communists. In contrast to other √©migr√© political organizations, they argued against the idea of creating a \\"free Russia\\" on non-Russian soil, believing strongly that what they called \\"Soviet-occupied Russia\\" was the only Russia that could be in existence. The Mladorossi believed that the Soviet government, for all its negative ideology, was preserving the Russian state and defending its national interests. They also believed that the October Revolution was merely the beginning of an evolutionary process that would create a new, young Russia (hence their use of the prefix mlado which means \\"young\\").  Similar groups  Several √©migr√© movements with a similar ideology evolved at around the same time, notably the Evraziitsi, and the Smenovekhovtsi. Other √©migr√© movements and organizations, such as National Alliance of Russian Solidarists (NTS), the Russian Imperial Union Order, and the ROVS, were hostile to these movements, feeling they were trying to justify the October Revolution and reconcile with the Bolsheviks.  Ideology  Members of the Mladorossi attending a party meeting. Kazembek along with Vonsiatsky and Bermondt-Avalov attending the 1933 Russian Fascist conference in Berlin The Mladorossi organization had a fascist influence as demonstrated by its doctrine and as visible through its use of the Roman salute popularized by the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini to salute its leader (renounced when Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa). Alexander Kazembek saw from fascism the combination of traditionalism, nationalism, anti-communism, as well as the desire to lean on the masses hence the imitation of the Italian fascists.https://www.vatnikstan.ru/history/mladorossy/ Kazembek also was in some sort of contact with Mussolini.https://wg-lj.livejournal.com/727343.html In 1933 Kazembek attended a conference in Berlin where he signed a cooperation pact with Anastasy Vonsiatsky's All-Russian Fascist Organisation and Pavel Bermondt-Avalov's Russian National Socialist Movement, this was motivated by the Nazi Party's anti-communist stance however when this evolved into anti- Russian sentiment the Mladorossi denounced Nazism with its general secretary, Kirill Elita-Vilchkovsky, referring to the ideology as \\"Satanic- fascism\\".https://www.vatnikstan.ru/history/mladorossy/ The Mladorossi were also monarchist oriented. They recognized Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia as the legitimate heir of the Russian throne and the latter became supportive of the organization.  Collapse  In the 1930s, the Mladorossi adopted an increasingly open pro-Soviet position, claiming that they were to become the \\"second Soviet party\\". While still declaring Stalin as their enemy, the Mladorossi believed that a tsar could fully function in the Soviet system that was in place at the time in the USSR. This earned the Mladorossi the label of being \\"Soviet patriots\\" amidst the White √©migr√©s, and speculation began that the organization was being influenced, if not controlled, by the Soviet secret police. The founder of the Mladorossi, Alexander Kazembek, was implicated of having ties with the Soviet consulate and the OGPU. In 1937, after being spotted in a cafe in France speaking to several Soviet diplomats, Kazembek resigned his post. After World War II, he emigrated to the United States and lived in California and then Connecticut and then moved to the USSR, where he lived out the rest of his years. At the start of World War II, many Mladorossi volunteered to join the French Resistance. After the war ended, the organisation dissolved and was no longer heard of.

Before the show's conception, Cirque du Soleil attempted to revive one of its previous shows, Le Cirque R√©invent√©. The attempt was abandoned after a weak critical reception. Lalibert√© and Ste-Croix instead created a new show based on the plans that had originally been drawn up by Caron before his departure. Originally intended to be called Eclipse, they renamed the show Nouvelle Exp√©rience and launched it in 1990. Franco Dragone agreed to return‚Äîalbeit reluctantly‚Äîbut only if he had full creative control of the show's environment. One of the first things he did was to remove the curtain that separated the artist from the audience, so that they would both feel part of a larger show. Whereas in a traditional circus the artist could go past the curtain and drop his role, Dragone had created an environment where the artist had to remain in character for the full length of the production. Although Dragone was given full control over the show, Lalibert√© oversaw the entire production. He was in favor of Dragone's new ideas. Inspired by Jules Verne's \\"La Chasse au M√©t√©ore\\", Dragone's concept for the show was that the performers were playing the parts of jewels spread around the Earth. Nouvelle Exp√©rience turned out to be Cirque du Soleil's most popular show up to that point and would continue running until 1993. It spent one of those years at The Mirage Resort and Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, seen by over 1.3 million people during its 3¬Ω-year run. By the end of 1990, the company was profitable again and was prepared to start a new show. Characters Flounes: The fallen angels. Dressed in browns and ochres. * Devils: The spirits of disobedience. Dressed in reds. * Corporation: The slaves of the world. Dressed in blue. * Madame Corporation/Enterprise: Queen of the Flounes, and along with the Great Chamberlain, ruler of the Corporation. * Great Chamberlain (aka Ringmaster): Madame Corporation's right- hand man. * Everyman: Dressed in a brown suit, this clown character was originally performed by David Shiner. Shiner played a slightly absent-minded mute who tried to make friends with the Flounes; his acts included sparring with audience members who challenged him, and playing a incompetent film director who tries to make a romantic tragedy. British actor Geoff Hoyle replaced Shiner in early 1991 for one-off understudy performances in San Diego & Costa Mesa, California and again for Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Toronto, Ontario & Chicago, Illinois. for those performances, he brought over his \\"Mr. Sniff\\" and Three-Legged Man skits from the Pickle Family Circus. Hoyle's clown character was more mischievous than Shiner's, often stealing people's possessions and ripping the shirts off unsuspecting audience members. When Shiner left the show in late 1991, Rodrigue \\"Chocolat\\" Tremblay, who had previously performed in two of Cirque's previous productions, Le Grand Tour & Le Magie Continue, replaced him during the show's performances in Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia. he performed some of the same acts as Shiner, along with his own act, known simply as \\"Cloches\\" where he would conduct an orchestra of audience members playing bells. When the show re-opened at The Mirage casino in 1992, Tremblay was replaced by another performer named Kenny Raskin, with Gerry Regitschnig and Paul Vachon sometimes serving as understudies. Acts The acts of Nouvelle Exp√©rience blended theatre, music, circus arts and dance: * Contortion: Four women, clad in pink, take to a suspended platform. The four twist and bend themselves into unbelievable positions. (Performed to \\"Meandres\\" on the soundtrack) * Korean plank: Madame and the Corporation approach a seesaw-like object in the middle of the stage. They begin to jump on the ends, bouncing the opposite performer into the air. Soon, they begin performing twists and spins, and even form towers by flipping acrobats onto other acrobats' shoulders. (Performed to \\"Bascule\\" on the soundtrack.) * Solo trapeze: An odd introduction happens between one of the Flounes and the Everyman. Afterwards, a woman takes to the stage, and is lifted towards a trapeze. She begins a beautiful number above, while flounes and devils watch from below. (Performed to \\"Fixe\\", \\"Ballant\\", and \\"Baleines\\" on the soundtrack) * Fil de fer: One of the flounes moves about on a wooden ball. He spins, dances, and jumps until the Everyman enters the stage. At this point, the Everyman and the Floune try to shake hands again, but this attempt is successful. They begin to dance until the four other flounes enter near backstage. They take the fifth floune's ball, do a little trick with a quilt, and it reveals a tightrope walker. The man jumps up onto his tightrope (which is five or so feet high) and begins to perform many tricks. The ringmaster gives it a try and fails miserably. The two switch off, and the ringmaster gets better and better until the two are performing together. * Fanfare: A little parade led by Madame Corporation introduces the next act. (Performed to \\"Fanfare\\" on the soundtrack) * Aerial straps: A muscular man approaches two leather straps hanging from the ceiling. He takes to the straps and takes flight. He spins, flips, and hangs to a lyrical cello piece entitled \\"L'oiseau\\". * Trapeze: Six figures climb three rope ladders up to an unusual flying trapeze apparatus. There is one regular trapeze, a two-layered trapeze, and a Russian trapeze. They swing back and forth between the three, performing daring tricks. (Performed to \\"Azimut\\" and \\"Sanza\\" on the soundtrack) * Foot juggling: Two beautiful oriental women take to the stage. First, one begins to spin umbrellas on her feet and hands. Soon, she is juggling the other girl, and the other girl is spinning cloths on her feet. (Performed to \\"Suite Chinoise\\" on the soundtrack) * Russian bar/Trampoline/Korean cradle: Three acts are combined into one (Performed to \\"Eclips√©\\" on the soundtrack): Russian bar ‚Äì A 5-inch-wide bar held by two men across their shoulders, while a third bounces on it.  Trampoline  Korean cradle ‚Äì Two men are strapped in on platforms, and take women by their hands to swing and flip them between one another. *Balancing on chairs: A man dressed in white takes to the stage, a few chairs in his hands. He begins to stack the chairs and balance on them, along with a flaming birthday cake. (Performed to \\"Havi Vahila\\" on the soundtrack) Costumes The costumes of Nouvelle Exp√©rience were designed to complement the wood theme of the set. Dominique Lemieux, costume designer, combined many different styles for the highly theatrical costumes, which makes it difficult to pin them down to any specific period. Surprisingly, some of the costumes worn are lined with upholstery material which make them very heavy. For example. the Flounes' medieval-esque costumes, made of a mix of lycra, velvet, and satin, weigh over . Music The show's original score was composed by Ren√© Dup√©r√© and performed live by five musicians. The show featured one singer, C√©cile Ardail, who sang for the balancing on chairs act as well as played one of the Floune characters. A studio album of the music was released in 1990 and again in 1993, the tracks of which are listed below. It features two singers, Francine Poitras, who sang only for the album, and C√©cile Ardail. The track of the Fil de Fer act is the only one which was not recorded on the album.

Schuyler Miller, reviewing the work in Analog Science Fiction / Science Fact, notes that \\"[t]he subtitle of this book explains its content well enough,\\" calling it \\"a running account of the wrong- headedness of irrational Man, which seems to make him a natural patsy for con- men.\\" By its end, the reader \\"will have dipped into the various forms which magic has taken and is taking, and will have been introduced to some of the eminent dupes who believed in it and the successful charlatans and fanatics who hoodwinked them.\\" In fact, his \\"main quarrel with the book\\" is that \\"it is presented almost wholly as a ballet of dupes and charlatans;\\" he considers the authors \\"a little too unyielding in their criteria for distinguishing between scientists and charlatans,\\" adding \\"I have the feeling that the de Camps, rationalists themselves, simply could not generate the same kind of understanding interest in this behavior that they showed in their examination of ancient ruins (archeological and archaeologists), or that Sprague brought to his classic study of lost continents.\\" He views \\"[b]y far the best\\" the last chapter, \\"'The Great Glass Jewel,' which sums up the authors' conclusions about the interrelationships of magic, religion and science.\\" He praises the bibliography as the kind he \\"like[s] to see ... limited to the references the author has used and to which he makes useful references.\\"Miller, P.

History The oldest indigenous Anglican order in the United States, it was founded in New York City in 1865 by Harriet Starr Cannon and a small group of fellow nuns. It was formally constituted by Bishop Horatio Potter of New York as the Sisters of St. Mary. The Episcopal Church was initially slow to recognize the order, and they only found wide support after four of the sisters died nursing victims of a yellow fever epidemic in Memphis, Tennessee in 1878. These four sisters are now commemorated by the Episcopal Church on September 9 as the Martyrs of Memphis or as Constance and her Companions. The community now consists of three independent provinces: Eastern, Western, and Southern. Rule of life Their rule of life is very similar to the Benedictine rule, and they live a mixed life of prayer and service. The sisters in the Eastern Province pray the Divine Office five times each day, and the community's Monastic Diurnal Revised https://www.amazon.com/Monastic-Diurnal-Revised-Sisterhood-Mary/dp/B001GGRC94 is a popular prayer book for many outside of the community as well. From their foundation in 1865 the first sisters took charge of the \\"House of Mercy\\" in New York. Then and now the sisters have felt called to the care of \\"the lost, forgotten, and underprivileged\\"Quoted from the sisters' entry in \\"Anglican Religious Life 2012-13\\", Canterbury Press, Norwich, page 64. after the example of many Christian saints, including St Vincent de Paul. Provinces =Eastern= The Eastern Province sisters moved in 2003 from Peekskill, New York to Greenwich, New York, where they own a facility adjoining the Spiritual Life Center of the Episcopal Diocese of Albany. The sisters engage in various activities, which include participating at the healing center of the Spiritual Life Center, giving retreats, working with a local Boy Scout troop, and speaking at various churches. They also raise cashmere goats and run a 4-H program for local youth. They continue to wear the traditional habit. =Southern= The Southern Province sisters trace their descent from the remnants of the Memphis sisters. Their current chapel houses the altar, aumbry, and chalice that were originally located in the Memphis house. The sisters formerly operated a girls' school in Sewanee‚ÄîSt. Mary's Preparatory School for Girls‚Äîwhich closed at the end of the 1967-1968 school year. The school is now a retreat center for individual and group retreats, in addition to hosting presentations on contemplative prayer. The convent and the retreat center are located near the campus of the Sewanee: The University of the South. The sisters say the office from the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, in addition to a daily mass, every day except Monday, which is the sisters' Sabbath. =Western= The Western Province sisters pursue individual ministries, but are especially involved in offering retreats and spiritual direction at Mary's Margin in Mukwonago, Wisconsin. Overseas houses Five of the sisters in Malawi. =Malawi= A branch house of the Eastern Province of the Order was established in Malawi in 2002. The initial group of Malawian sisters completed their novitiate at the American house, but now they have enough professed sisters to train novices in Malawi. They are hoping to establish a crisis nursery for babies whose parents are unable to care for them because of AIDS. They also give presentations in churches, visit the sick, lead Bible studies, preach, and work on their farm, helping other women to learn sustainable agriculture techniques. =Philippines= The sisters also have a mission in the Philippines, which has been in existence for over thirty years, and forms part of the Southern Province. St Mary's Convent is located in the predominantly Anglican town of Sagada, Mountain Province. It is attached to the Church of Saint Mary the Virgin, which belongs to the Episcopal Church in the Philippines.

The other play mechanics include the free market economics, which allows the players to design and craft goods, and the player-run social structure, including Houses (formerly guilds) and politics. The world consists of over twenty thousand locations, known as rooms, ranging from common countryside to more exotic and surreal environments. Players may choose among eighteen classes, ranging from familiar fantasy elements such as paladins to more unusual options such as Tarot-using Occultists. Recent structural changes have enriched the environment of Achaea further, by opening up the seas to player controlled ships. This has made available many minigames including diving for treasure, deep-sea fishing and even a form of piracy.  Revenue  Achaea is one of the first known examples of a game with microtransactions. It had been initially launched when Internet service plans were time-limited, effectively gating access to MUDs so that their cost of operations were low. However, when America On-Line offered flat-rate plans, this removed that gate, and many MUDs like Achaea became unprofitable since players could spend much more time on them. Achaeas creator Matt Mihaly came up with the idea of a dual currency system to generate revenue to cover the higher operating costs; while one in- game currency remained free, the other premium currency could only be purchased with real-world funds, and many special items could only be purchased with the premium currency. Achaea's controversial revenue structure has received attention from the game development industry. Although Iron Realms Entertainment provides a custom MUD interface for the game, there are neither up-front costs, nor monthly fees typical for the MMORPG-genre. Instead, players may spend money for credits that are then used in-game to acquire skills and superior equipment. Recently, however, Achaea has somewhat deviated from this model. In early 2010, the option to purchase an Iron Elite membership became available, which periodically gives players credits and other bonuses in exchange for a monthly fee. The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has noted that Achaea has been successful in this \\"revenue from object sales\\" model, \\"report[ing] substantially higher average revenue per customer ... than the usual subscription prices.\\". Achaea's use of this model was compared to higher-profile releases such as Magic: The Gathering Online and Project Entropia and has been highlighted by game developer Daniel James and researcher Richard Bartle as a possible solution for the problems other online games face involving commodification and interaction with real economy.  Reviews and reactions  Achaea has received generally positive reviews for both its mechanics and social complexities, including a review from Leo Laporte on the June 10, 2004 episode of The Screen Savers on TechTV that was reported as favourable. The combat system includes \\"hundreds of different ways to attack an opponent\\", leading to a \\"complex array of strategies\\" that is a \\"true test of skill\\". The game's engine was adapted for use as the medium of an \\"e-summit\\" staged at the 7th Annual World Summit of Young Entrepreneurs with the United Nations. The role-playing and social aspects of the game have also led to Achaea being cited as an example of \\"political game design\\". That political system, along with the game's dynamic events and \\"player narrative\\" are remarked on in Designing Virtual Worlds, Bartle's examination of the history of multiplayer online games. Iron Realms Entertainment quotes id Software founder John Romero as saying he \\"doesn't believe there is a deeper game in existence\\".  Controversy  Nevertheless, some aspects of the game have met with criticism. The game's revenue system, in particular, has faced mixed opinions. Players playing for free \\"won't be able to advance as much as the person who has the funds\\" without a considerable time investment, which often sparks controversy between free players and those who paid for in-game bonuses that can cost as much as 2500 credits, the equivalent of $725 per item. The IGDA acknowledges that the system requires \\"delicate issues of design balance\\". The 2004 introduction of gleam, an in-game addictive drug, created controversy, angering some players and reviewers who felt it sent an inappropriate message about the consequences of real-world drug use.

Streisand plays the role of a somewhat uneducated actress, model and part-time prostitute. She temporarily lives with an educated aspiring writer played by Segal. Their many differences are obvious, yet over time they begin to admire each other. Comedian/actor Robert Klein appears in a supporting role.  Plot  Felix Sherman (Segal), a nebbish book clerk and aspiring novelist, struggles to maintain peace and quiet in his walk-up New York City apartment. When he reports to his landlord that his brass, uneducated neighbor Doris (Streisand) is working as a prostitute, she is suddenly evicted. She then confronts him about this immediately, in the middle of the night. Felix, who hadn't intended that she actually be evicted, reluctantly agrees to let her stay at his apartment on a temporary basis. However, soon after on that same night, Doris accidentally sees Felix naked, causing her to laugh and to develop a furious case of the hiccups. She asks Felix to scare her so that she stop hiccuping. He obliges, dressing up in a skeleton Halloween costume and jumping at her suddenly. She reflexively acts in self-defense and the noise of their scuffle causes the landlord to barge in and evict Felix. Now both evicted, they relocate to the upscale apartment of Felix's friend and coworker Barney (Klein). The two very different personalities continue to clash throughout the night as Felix tries in vain to maintain his routine and to finally get some sleep. The TV-loving Doris gets upset after Felix reads her an excerpt from his novel, which she vehemently dislikes, and the noise from their argument causes Barney to leave. Nevertheless, as Felix and Doris get to know each other better, discussing topics like Doris' various stage names, they grow to like each other and they make love. In the morning, however, their fighting resumes and Doris leaves in anger. Felix and Doris go back to their lives and both struggle professionally. Felix walks past a theater showing an adult film starring Doris and, though out of place in the sordid atmosphere, he decides to watch it out of curiosity. He gets uncomfortable and leaves midway through the film. Now a week after Doris had left, one of Doris' friends Eleanor (Kelly) goes to the bookstore where Felix works and mistakenly confronts Barney instead of him. Eleanor then tells Felix that Doris is at a cafe, where Felix goes to meet her. They two walk around the city near Lincoln Center, now clearly drawn to each other and Felix is impressed by how Doris has been trying hard to expand her vocabulary. However, their night is interrupted when they have to run away from a group of violent youths. They then go to the fancy townhouse where Felix is staying, where Felix discovers more details about Doris' past that make him uncomfortable and where Doris discovers that Felix is actually engaged to be married. Doris puts Felix in bed and tells him both that she is planning to move to Los Angeles and that she has thought about the excerpt from his novel that he had read to her before and now really likes it. He kisses her and they make love again. They then get stoned and continue to bond. Suddenly, however, Felix's financee (Anson) and her parents (Manning, Carney) return and discover a high Felix and Doris with each other in the bathtub. Kicked out of the townhouse and no longer high, Doris and a frustrated Felix, carrying his typewriter, walk together in Central Park that morning. They start to argue and Felix cruelly makes fun of Doris on top of Cedar Hill. She starts to cry and a regretful Felix kisses her hand before she smacks him. Felix admits to her that his actual name is Fred and he tosses his typewriter down the hill. Doris admits that her full name is Doris Wilgus. Now, finally without any pretensions between each other, they walk away together, as a happy couple.

He was previously a blogger and columnist for The Washington Post and an associate editor of The American Prospect. He has served as a contributor to Bloomberg News and MSNBC. At The Washington Post, he managed a branded blog, Wonkblog, which featured his writing and the writing of other policy reporters. Issues discussed in the blog included health care and budget policy. He wrote a primer on policy called Wonkbook, which was delivered by e-mail and on his blog each morning. In January 2014, Klein left The Washington Post and co-founded Vox, a website for explanatory news owned by Vox Media. He served as the editor-in-chief of Vox until September 2017, when he transitioned into his current role. His debut book, Why We're Polarized, was published in January 2020. Early life and education Klein was raised in a Jewish family in Irvine, California. Klein is a middle child. His father, Abel Klein, is a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Irvine, originally from Brazil; his mother is an artist. Klein attended University High School, where he was a poor student and graduated in 2002 with a 2.2 GPA. After graduating from high school, Klein attended the University of California, Santa Cruz for two years before transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles, from which he graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. While at UCSC, he applied to write for City on a Hill Press but was rejected. He said school was never a great fit for him academically or socially. Career Klein worked on Howard Dean's primary campaign in Vermont in 2003 and interned for the Washington Monthly in Washington, D.C., in 2004. \\"The media is as effective and important an agent for change as the legislative bodies, and I think it's where I'm happiest and most effective,\\" Klein said. In 2003, he and Markos Moulitsas were two of the earliest bloggers to report from a political convention, that of the California State Democratic Party. In 2006, Klein was one of several writers pseudonymously flamed by The New Republic writer Lee Siegel (posting as a sock puppet called sprezzatura). On December 10, 2007, Klein moved his blog full- time to the American Prospect. Klein's prolific blogging caught the attention of Steve Pearlstein, The Washington Post veteran business columnist. \\"I was blown away by how good he was‚Äîhow much the kid wrote‚Äîon so many subjects,\\" Pearlstein said. Pearlstein sent samples of Klein's work to managing editor Raju Narisetti. A few weeks after he heard from Pearlstein, Washington Post foreign correspondent John Pomfret asked Klein to have lunch with him and financial editor Sandy Sugawara. Narisetti hired Klein to be the Post's first pure blogger on politics and economics. On May 18, 2009, he began writing at the newspaper. In May 2011, when Bloomberg View launched, Klein became a columnist there in addition to his work at The Washington Post and MSNBC. Klein announced he would be leaving The Washington Post in January 2014, with the intent to start a new media venture with several other veteran journalists. The new media venture was later identified as the politics site Vox. Klein had previously \\"proposed the creation of an independent, explanatory journalism website‚Äîwith more than three dozen staffers\\" and an annual budget of more than to remain at The Washington Post. During negotiations, Post publisher Katharine Weymouth and new owner Jeff Bezos did not make a counteroffer. Klein was editor-in-chief at Vox, now editor-at- large, and formerly wrote for and edited Wonkblog at The Washington Post. He frequently provides political commentary on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, Hardball with Chris Matthews, and The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. He is a former contributor to Countdown with Keith Olbermann. On March 14, 2013, The Week magazine reported that Klein was among those being considered to host MSNBC's yet-unnamed 8 p.m. weekday prime-time show that would replace The Ed Show. Ultimately, the time slot was filled with All In with Chris Hayes. In October 2015, Klein, along with Sarah Kliff and Matt Yglesias, launched The Weeds, a Vox podcast of detailed discussions on public policy. Klein also hosts the podcast The Ezra Klein Show. Klein is an executive producer of Vox Netflix series Explained, which debuted in 2018. In October 2019, Klein, along with other reporters from Vox Media, started the Impeachment, Explained podcast. =Health care debate= In December 2009, Klein wrote an article in The Washington Post, stating that U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman was \\"willing to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in order to settle an old electoral score,\\" because Lieberman \\"was motivated to oppose health care legislation in part out of resentment at liberals for being defeated in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic Primary.\\" Klein based his estimate on an Urban Institute report that estimated that 22,000 people died in 2006 because they lacked health insurance.Dorn, Stan. Uninsured and Dying Because of It: Updating the Institute of Medicine Analysis on the Impact of Uninsurance on Mortality. Urban Institute. This article was criticized by Jonah Goldberg of the National Review, who called it a \\"silly claim.\\" Charles Lane, also of The Washington Post, described Klein's article as an \\"outrageous smear.\\" But E. J. Dionne, also of The Washington Post, agreed with Klein's claim, saying that \\"Klein is right that there is not a shred of principle in Lieberman's opposition.\\" Klein later said he regretted the phrasing and his position is that despite universal coverage, the social determinants of health are still powerful predictors that, on average, ensure the lower socioeconomic classes die sooner than those with more income and education.Carney, Timothy (February 28, 2011) Turns out ObamaCare might not save hundreds of thousands of lives , Washington ExaminerEzra Klein (February 28, 2011). \\"Health care doesn't keep people healthy  even in Canada\\" The Washington Post Accessed July 14, 2011. =JournoList= In February 2007, Klein created a Google Groups forum called \\"JournoList\\" for discussing politics and the news media. The forum's membership was controlled by Klein and limited to \\"several hundred left- leaning bloggers, political reporters, magazine writers, policy wonks and academics.\\" Posts within JournoList were intended only to be made and read by its members. Klein defended the forum saying that it \\"[ensures] that folks feel safe giving off-the-cuff analysis and instant reactions.\\" JournoList member, and Time magazine columnist Joe Klein (no relation to Ezra Klein) added that the off-the-record nature of the forum was necessary because \\"candor is essential and can only be guaranteed by keeping these conversations private.\\" The existence of JournoList was first publicly revealed in a July 27, 2007, blog post by blogger Mickey Kaus. However, the forum did not attract serious attention until March 17, 2009, when an article published on Politico detailed the nature of the forum and the extent of its membership. The Politico article set off debate within the blogosphere over the ethics of participating in JournoList and raised questions about its purpose. The first public excerpt of a discussion within JournoList was posted by Mickey Kaus on his blog on March 26, 2009. In addition to Ezra Klein, members of JournoList included, among others, Jeffrey Toobin, Eric Alterman, Paul Krugman, Joe Klein, Matthew Yglesias, and Jonathan Chait. On June 25, 2010, Ezra Klein announced in his Washington Post blog that he would be terminating the JournoList group. This decision was instigated by fellow blogger Dave Weigel's resignation from the Post following the public exposure of several of his JournoList emails about conservative media figures.Keach Hagey, \\"David Weigel quits ‚Äì and a debate begins, Politico.com, June 25, 2010. Retrieved June 27, 2010. Klein had justified excluding conservative Republicans from participation as \\"not about fostering ideology but preventing a collapse into flame war. The emphasis is on empiricism, not ideology.\\"  Awards  In 2010, he was named Blogger of the Year by The Week magazine and The Sidney Hillman Foundation. In 2011, he was named one of the 50 most powerful people in Washington, D.C., by GQ. His blog was also named one of the 25 best financial blogs by Time magazine in 2011. In 2013, Klein won the Online News Association Award for Best Online Commentary. He also won the American Political Science Association's Carey McWilliams Award, for \\"a major journalistic contribution to our understanding of politics.\\" He appeared as one of 80 men featured in Esquire 80th anniversary issue and in a feature in T magazine.  Personal life  Klein is married to Annie Lowrey, an economic policy reporter at The Atlantic. The couple lives in Oakland, California, and they have one child, born six weeks preterm in February 2019.

It was founded in 1244 by bringing together several eremetical groups in the Tuscany region who were following the Rule of Saint Augustine, written by Saint Augustine of Hippo in the fifth century. They are also commonly known as the Augustinians or Austin friars, and were also historically known as the Order of Hermits of Saint Augustine (; abbreviated OESA). The order has, in particular, spread internationally the veneration of the Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady of Good Counsel (Mater boni consilii).Frisk, M. Jean. \\"Our Lady of Good Counsel\\", Marian Library, University of Dayton History =Background= Augustine of Hippo, first with some friends and afterward as bishop with his clergy, led a monastic community life. Religious vows were not obligatory. Regarding the use of property or possessions, Augustine did not make a virtue of poverty, but of sharing. Their manner of life led others to imitate them. Instructions for their guidance were found in several writings of Augustine, especially in De opere monachorum (P.L., XL, 527), mentioned in the ancient codices regularum of the eighth or ninth century as the \\"Rule of St. Augustine\\". Epistola ccxi, otherwise cix (P.L., XXXIII, 958), contains the early \\"Augustinian Rule for Nuns\\"; Epistolae ccclv and ccclvi (P.L., mmmlxv, 3065) contains De moribus clericorum. Between 430 and 570 this life-style was carried to Europe by monks and clergy fleeing the persecution of the Vandals.\\"History of the Order\\", Order of Saint Augustine This system of life for cathedral clergy continued in various locations throughout Europe for centuries. As the first millennium came to an end, the fervor of this life began to wane, and the cathedral clergy began to live independently of one another. At the start of the second millennium, there was a revival in interest in the stricter form of clerical life. Several groups of canons were established under various disciplines, all with the Augustinian Rule as their basis. Examples of these were the Congregation of canons in Ravenna, founded by the Blessed Peter de Honestis about 1100, as well as the Norbertines. The instructions contained in Augustine's Rule formed the basis of the Rule that, in accordance with the decree of the Lateran Synod of 1059, was adopted by canons who desired to practice a common apostolic life (Holstenius, Codex regularum, II, Rome, 1661, 120), hence the title of Canons Regular of Saint Augustine. = First eremitical communities = Around the start of the 13th century, many eremitical communities, especially in the vicinity of Siena, Italy, sprang up. These were often small (no more than ten) and composed of laymen, thus they lacked the clerical orientation of the canons. Their foundational spirit was one of solitude and penance. With time, some of the communities adopted a more outward looking way of life. As the number of hermit-priests increased, assisting the local clergy in providing spiritual care for their neighbors became a larger part of their lives. In 1223 four of the communities around Siena joined in a loose association, which had increased to thirteen within five years. =Little Union= The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 issued the decree Ne nimium to organise these small groups of religious people by requiring them to live in community, to hold elective chapters, to be under obedience to a major superior and to adopt one of the Rules of community life that were approved by the Church. The Augustinian friars came into being as part of the mendicant movement of the 13th century, a new form of religious life which sought to bring the religious ideals of the monastic life into an urban setting which allowed the religious to serve the needs of the People of God in an apostolic capacity. At this time there were a number of eremitical groups living in such diverse places as Tuscany, Latium, Umbria, Liguria, England, Switzerland, Germany, and perhaps France. In 1243 the Tuscan hermits petitioned Pope Innocent IV to unite them all as one group. Innocent IV issued the Bull Incumbit Nobis on 16 December 1243, an essentially pastoral letter which exhorted these hermits to adopt \\"the Rule and way of life of the Blessed Augustine,\\" to profess this Augustinian manner of life in a way that they themselves would decide with regards to a specific charism and apostolate, and to elect a Prior General. The bull also appointed Cardinal Riccardo Annibaldi as their supervisor and legal guide. The importance of this man in the foundation of the order cannot be overstated.Rano, Balbino, Augustinian Origins, Charism, and Spirituality, Villanova, Augustinian Press, 1994, 29 =Grand Union= On 15 July 1255, Pope Alexander IV issued the bull Cum quaedam salubria to command a number of religious groupings to gather for the purpose of being amalgamated into a new Order of Hermits of Saint Augustine. The delegates including other small religious communities met in Rome on 1 March 1256, which resulted in a union. Lanfranc Septala of Milan, Prior of the Bonites, was appointed the first Prior General of the newly constituted Order. The belted, black tunic of the Tuscan hermits was adopted as the common religious habit, and the walking sticks carried by the Bonites in keeping with eremetical tradition‚Äîand to distinguish themselves from those hermits who went around begging‚Äîceased to be used. On 9 April 1256 Pope Alexander IV issued the bull Licet Ecclesiae catholicae (Bullarium Taurinense, 3rd ed., 635 sq.) which confirmed the integration of the Hermits of John the Good (Rule of St. Augustine, 1225), the Hermits of St. William (Rule of St. Benedict), the Hermits of Brettino (Rule of St. Augustine, 1228), the Hermits of Monte Favale (Rule of St. Benedict), other smaller congregations, and the Tuscan Hermits into what was officially called the Order of Hermits of Saint Augustine. Special constitutions were drawn up for its government, on the same lines as the Dominicans and other mendicantsa general elected by chapter, provincials to rule in the different countries, with assistants, definitors and visitors. For this reason, and because almost from the beginning the term \\"hermits\\" became a misnomer (for they abandoned the deserts and lived conventionally in towns), they ranked among the friars, and became the fourth of the mendicant orders. The observance and manner of life was mild relative to those times, meat being allowed four days in the week. =Privileges of the order= Ecclesiastical privileges were granted to the order almost from its beginning. Alexander IV freed the order from the jurisdiction of the bishops; Innocent VIII, in 1490, granted to the churches of the order indulgences such as can only be gained by making the Stations at Rome; Pope Pius V placed the Augustinians among the mendicant orders and ranked them next to the Carmelites. Since the end of the 13th century the sacristan of the Papal Palace was always to be an Augustinian friar, who would be ordained as a Bishop. This privilege was ratified by Pope Alexander VI and granted to the Order forever by a Bull issued in 1497. The holder of the office was Rector of the Vatican parish (of which the chapel of St. Paul is the parish church). To his office also belonged the duty of preserving in his oratory a consecrated Host, which had to be renewed weekly and kept in readiness in case of the pope's illness, when it was the privilege of the papal sacristan to administer the last sacraments to the pope. The sacristan had always to accompany the pope when he traveled, and during a conclave it was he who celebrated Mass and administered the sacraments. He lived at the Vatican with a sub-sacristan and three lay brothers of the order (cf. Rocca, \\"Chronhistoria de Apostolico Sacrario\\", Rome, 1605). Augustinian friars, as of 2009, still perform the duties of papal sacristans, but the appointment of an Augustinian bishop- sacristan lapsed under Pope John Paul II with the retirement of Petrus Canisius Van Lierde in 1991. In papal Rome the Augustinian friars always filled one of the Chairs of the Sapienza University, and one of the consultorships in the Congregation of Rites. =Missions= The value set upon learning and science by the Augustinian friars is demonstrated by the care given to their missionary work, their libraries, and by the historic establishment of their own printing-press in their convent at Nuremberg (1479), as well as by the numerous learned individuals produced by the order. The order has produced many saints, for example Clare of Montefalco, Nicholas of Tolentino (d. 1305), Rita of Cascia, John of Sahag√∫n (a Sancto Facundo) (d. 1479), and Thomas of Villanova (d. 1555). Stefano Bellesini (d. 1840), the Augustinian parish priest of Genazzano, in the Roman province, was beatified by Pius X on 27 December 1904. Africa The Augustinians followed the Portuguese flag in Africa and the Gulf behind the explorer and seafarer Vasco da Gama. Nikolaus Teschel (d. 1371), auxiliary Bishop of Ratisbon, where he died, with some brethren preached the Gospel in Africa. He had sailed from Lisbon in 1497, and arrived at Mozambique in March 1498. Portuguese Augustinians also arrived in Gold coast (now Ghana) in 1572 and started their missionary work, and also worked on the island of Sao Tome, in Warri (Nigeria), and in what is now known as Angola, in the Congo, in Equatorial Guinea, and in Gabon up until 1738. The Portuguese also took control of the port of Goa in India‚Äîgiving the Augustinians a foothold there also. Besides the early Portuguese Augustinians, other Augustinian missionaries have since followed to Africa from America, Ireland, Belgium and Australia. The Americas =North America (US and Canada)= St. Thomas of Villanova Church, on the Villanova University campus The North American foundation of the order occurred in 1796 when Irish friars founded Olde St. Augustine's Church in Philadelphia.\\"Olde St. Augustine's Church\\", USHistory.org Michael Hurley was the first American to join the order the following year. Friars established schools, universities and other works throughout the Americas, including Villanova University (1842) near Philadelphia and Merrimack College (1947) near Boston. Secondary schools in the United States included: * Malvern Preparatory School (1842), Malvern, Pennsylvania; * St. Rita of Cascia High School (1905), Chicago, Illinois; * St. Augustine High School (1922), San Diego, California; * Villanova Preparatory School (1925), Ojai, California; * Cascia Hall Preparatory School (1926), Tulsa, Oklahoma; * Mendel Catholic High School (1951), Chicago, Illinois; * Monsignor Bonner High School (1953), Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania; * Austin Catholic Preparatory School (1954-1978), Detroit, Michigan; * St. Augustine College Preparatory School (1959), Richland, New Jersey; * Austin Preparatory School (1961), Reading, Massachusetts; * Providence Catholic High School (1962), New Lenox, Illinois. From 1925 and later during the Great Depression German Augustinians began arriving in North America to teach. After 1936, with the political situation in Nazi Germany worsening, more German Augustinians departed for North America. By 1939 there were 46 German priests, 13 German religious brothers and 8 German candidates in North America. The order established the first of their Canadian houses at Tracadie, Nova Scotia, in Canada in 1938. Among other Canadian foundations, the order also established a significant priory and school in King City, Ontario, near Toronto. Since 2006, it has professed many native Canadians. *St. Thomas of Villanova College (1999), King City, Ontario. As of 2006 there were more than 70 Augustinian priories in the United States and Canada with 386 friars in solemn vows and 16 in simple vows.N.B. Augustinian friars numbers cited from information on the website International Order of St. Augustine =Latin America= Monastery of San Agustin of Yuriria, Mexico, founded in 1550. Sent by their Provincial St. Thomas of Villanova, the first group of Spanish/Castilian Augustinians arrived in Mexico in 1533c.f. Augustinians in the Americas Augnet historical information after the subjugation of Aztec Mexico by Hernan Cortez. Melchor de Vargas composed, in 1576, a catechism in the Mexican Otomi language; Diego Basalenque (d. 1651) and Miguel de Guevara compiled works in the languages of the Matlaltzinkas of Mexico; Manuel Perez translated the Roman Catechism into Aztec in 1723. Monasteries sprang up in the principal places and became the centers of Christianity, art, and civilization. The Patio (Cloister) of the former monastery of St. Augustine, now the post office, at Quer√©taro, is one of the most beautiful examples of stone-carving in America. They soon formed multiple priories, including at Guanajuato (pictured) and were later instrumental in establishing the Pontifical and Royal University of Mexico. By 1562 there were nearly 300 Spanish Augustinians in Mexico, and they had established some 50 priories. Their history in Mexico was not to be an easy one, given the civil strife of events like the Cristero War, periodic anti-clericalism and suppression of the church that was to follow. Spanish Augustinians first went to Peru in 1551. From there they went to Ecuador in 1573, and from Ecuador in 1575 to Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Panama and Venezuela. The order founded the Ecuadorean University of Quito in 1586. Augustinians also entered Argentina via Chile between 1617 and 1626, and their history there was eventful. The order had considerable property confiscated by the Argentinian government under the secularisation laws in the 19th century, and were entirely suppressed for 24 years until 1901 when they returned. The Augustinian Province of the Netherlands later also founded houses in Bolivia from 1930. In 1962, Pope John XXIII asked for religious orders in the United States to send 10% of their members to evangelize Latin America. He later specifically invited the Augustinians of the Midwest Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel, headquartered near Chicago, to care for missionary territory in Northern Peru. The Augustinians accepted the invitation and began their missionary service in 1964. Their primary assignment was to the newly created Prelature of Chulucanas, which was later erected to become the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chulucanas. The diocese split what was once the Eastern territory of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Piura. The Augustinians also began new service in the nation's capital of Lima. The Provincia Michoacanensis had about 55 members, while the Provincia Mexicana had 31, most of whom are priests. Augustinian missionaries extended their friaries to South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru). Political events in these countries prevented the order from prospering and hindered the success of its undertakings, so that during the 19th century the monasteries became deserted. Later events in the Philippine Islands, however, permitted the Augustinians to return to their former churches and monasteries and even to found new ones. In the Republic of Colombia, 26 members of the Philippine province were employed in 1900, including 6 at the residence of Santa Fe de Bogot√°, 8 in the college at Facatativa, and 12 at other stations. In Peru 49 members of the same province were employed: 14 priests and 2 lay brothers belonging to the convent at Lima; 12 priests to the college in the same city; 6 in each of the two seminaries at Cuzco and Ayacucho. In the Prefecture Apostolic of San Le√≥n de Amazonas, at the mission stations of Peba, R√≠o Tigre, and Leticia in the territory of the Iquito Indians there were 9 priests in 1900. In June, 1904, Bernardo Calle, the lay brother Miguel Vilajoli, and more than 70 Christians were murdered at a then recently erected mission station, Huabico, in Upper Maranon and the station itself was destroyed. The Augustinian settlements in Brazil of the 19th century then belonged to the Philippine province. In the procuration house at S. Paulo (Rua Apeninos 6) and in the college at Brotas there were 4 Augustinians each; in the diocesan seminary at S. Jos√© de Manaos, 6; and in the other settlements, 27 priests‚Äîin all, 42 members of the order, including one lay brother. In Argentina, there were 25 priests and two lay brothers in the six colleges and schools of the order in 1900. In Ecuador, which formed a province by itself, there were 21 members of the order in 1900, with 9 priests and 7 lay brothers in the monastery at Quito, 3 priests in the convent at Latagun, and 2 in that at Guayaquil. The province of Chile had 56 members in 1900, including 18 lay brothers: 11 at Santiago, 4 at La Serena, 5 at Concepci√≥n, 22 at Talca, 8 at San Fernando, 4 at Melipilla, and 2 in the residence at Picazo. The province of the United States of America increased in the end of the 19th century as the Augustinians were driven out of many European countries, and in 1848 sought refuge in the USA. The province numbered 200 members in 1900. The largest convent was then at Villanova, Pennsylvania; it was also the novitiate for North America, and among the 117 religious then occupying the convent 21 were priests. The other convents contained 60 members by 1900, of whom 5 were lay brothers. The order (from Mexico) arrived in Cuba in 1608. It was suppressed by force in 1842. From 1892 the province of the United States had care of St. Augustine's College at Havana, Cuba, where there were 5 priests and 3 lay brothers in 1900 before they were expelled in 1961 by the government of Fidel Castro. *Latest Statistics: In the year 2000 in Central and South America,N.B. South American Augustinian friars numbers not available online the Augustinians remain established in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela as well three Peruvian Vicariates of Iquitos, Apur√≠mac and Chulucanas, and the Province of Peru. There are currently 814 friars in Latin America. Oceania By the early 20th century, the Augustinians established missions in Oceania and Australia. The Spanish Augustinians took over the missions founded by Spanish and German Jesuits in the Ladrones, which then numbered 7 stations with about 10,000 people on Guam, and about 2500 on each of the German islands of Saipan, Rota and Tinian. The mission on the German islands was separated from the Diocese of Ceb√∫ on 1 October 1906, and made a prefecture Apostolic on 18 June 1907, with Saipan as its seat of administration, and the mission given in charge to the German Capuchins. =Australia= In Australia the Augustinians were established in the ecclesiastical Province of Melbourne and in the Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown, Queensland, with twelve priests of the Irish province under Monsignor James D. Murray. The order has furnished some prominent bishops to Australia, e.g. Irishman James Alipius Goold. The Irish Augustinian college of St. Patrick at Rome, built in 1884 by Patrick Glynn, was then the training college for the Augustinian missions. James Alipius Goold had been the first Augustinian to arrive in the Australian colonies in 1838. He had been convinced to go to Australia by William Bernard Ullathorne (then the Benedictine Vicar-General of New Holland) after a chance meeting on the steps of the Roman Augustinian church at the monastery of Santa Maria del Popolo.Arneil, Stan pp. 34 \\"Out Where the Dead Men Lie\\" (The Augustinians in Australia 1838‚Äì1992) Augustinian Press Brookvale (1992). pp37. Goold began his missionary work in Sydney under Archbishop John Bede Polding, becoming parish priest at Campbelltown. He went on in 1848 to become the founding bishop and first Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Melbourne. He also commenced the design and construction of its Neo-Gothic Cathedral. Despite's Goold's initial desire to establish immediately an Australian branch of the order, the first Australian Augustinian was not ordained until 1940, and the Australian Province was not formally established as separate from its Irish founding province until 1952. The Irish Augustinian friars formally accepted responsibility in 1884 for the part of Queensland that became the Diocese of Cairns, and the first Australian priory was founded at Echuca, Victoria, in 1886. Priories were established at Rochester in 1889 and Kyabram in 1903. The order worked at different times in the colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, taking part in some critical moments of the settlement and establishment of modern Australia. Charles O'Hea O.S.A. baptized Ned Kelly. Matthew Downing O.S.A. tried to calm the miners who were part of the Eureka Stockade in 1854. The order also supplied a number of the other early Australian bishops including Martin Crane O.S.A. and Stephen Reville O.S.A both in Sandhurst (Bendigo), John Heavey O.S.A. (Cairns), John Hutchinson O.S.A (Cooktown), and James Murray O.S.A. (Cooktown). The order presently conducts parishes, two schools (one established 1948 in Brisbane, the other established 1956 in Sydney), St John Stone House (a centre for Augustinian Spirituality), a formation centre, and special ministries such as palliative care, HIV/AIDS ministry, and Aboriginal ministry. Associated orders such as the St John of God Brothers (arrived Australia 1947 and established mental health services) and the Filipino Augustinian Sisters of our Lady of Consolation also established an Australian house in the 1990s. *Latest Statistics: As of 2006 there were 11 other Augustinian priories in Australiac.f.

South-East Asia =Indonesia= Two Dutch Augustinian friars re-established the order in Papua (now Indonesia) in 1953 while it was still a Dutch colony. In 1956 the order took responsibility for the area that was to become the Diocese of Manokwari. As of 2006, the Augustinian Vicariate of Indonesia has 15 friars in solemn profession, and 7 in simple vows. It is now predominantly Papuan. The order of friars and affiliated orders are growing in Indonesia. =Philippines= The Augustinian friars were the first Christian missionaries to settle in what was regarded as Asia's only Catholic nation, and the leader of these first missionaries was the navigator Andr√©s de Urdaneta (1498June 3, 1568, Mexico), an Augustinian friar. He was navigator on the journey that established the first permanent Spanish settlement in the Philippines. The historic Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines was officially formed on December 31, 1575, as an offshoot of the establishment of the first permanent Spanish settlements. San Agust√≠n Church and Monastery in Manila became the centre of Augustinian efforts to evangelise the Philippines. Herrera wrote a poetical life of Jesus in the Tagalog language in 1639. Cipriano Navarro's important work on \\"The Inhabitants of the Philippines\\" and a monumental work in six volumes entitled \\"La Flora de Filipinas\\" (Madrid, 1877‚Äì ) are valuable contributions to literature and learning on the Philippines. Manuel Blanco, Ignacio Mercado, Antonio Llanos, Andr√©s Naves and Celestino Fernandez are also worthy of mention. Angelo Perez and Cecilio Guemes published in 1905 a work in four volumes entitled \\"La Imprenta de Manila\\". Arguably, the most energetic missionary activity of the Augustinian Order has been displayed in the Philippine Islands. When Ferdinand Magellan discovered the Philippines (16 March 1521) and took possession of them in the name of the King of Spain, he was accompanied by the chaplain of the fleet, who preached the Gospel to the inhabitants, baptizing Kings Colambu and Siagu and 800 natives of Mindanao and Ceb√∫, on Low Sunday, 7 April 1521. The effect of these conversions, however, were soon almost negated. Magellan was killed in a fight with natives on the little island of Mactan on 27 April and the Catholic foundation established by the first Spanish missionaries almost disappeared. The missionaries brought from Mexico in 1543 by Ruy L√≥pez Villalobos were not more successful, for they were forced to return to Europe by way of Goa, having had little influence on the islanders. Under the Adelantado Legaspi who in 1565 established the sovereignty of Spain in the Philippines and selected Manila as the capital in 1571, Andr√©s de Urdaneta and 4 other Augustinian friars landed at Ceb√∫ in 1565, and at once began a very successful apostolate. The first houses of the Augustinians were established at Ceb√∫, in 1565, and at Manila, in 1571. Augustinian friars made researches in the languages of the Philippine Islands including Diego Bergano, and Jos√© Sequi (d. 1844), a prominent missionary of the order who baptized 30,000 people. Many wrote grammars and compiled dictionaries. In 1575, under the leadership of Alfonso Gutierez, twenty-four Spanish Augustinians landed in the islands and, with the respective provincials Diego de Herrera and Martin de Rado, worked very successfully, at first as wandering preachers. Franciscans first appeared in the Philippines in 1577 and were welcomed by the Augustinians. Soon they were joined by Dominicans and Jesuits. Sent by Philip III, the first Discalced Augustinians landed in 1606. All these Orders shared in the work and challenges of the missions. Protected by Spain, they prospered, and their missionary efforts became more and more successful. In 1773 the Jesuits, however, were obliged to give up their missions in consequence of the suppression of the Society. Religious orders suffered persecution in the Philippines at the end of the 19th century, especially the Augustinians. In 1897 the Calced Augustinians, numbering 319 out of 644 religious then in the Philippine province, had charge of 225 parishes, with 2,377,743 people; the Augustinian Recollects, numbering about 220, with 233 parishes and 1,175,156 people; the Augustinians of the Philippine province numbered in all 522, counting those in the priories at Manila, Cavite, San Sebastian, and Ceb√∫, those at the large model farm at Imus, and those in Spain at the colleges of Monteagudo, Marcilla, and San Millan de la Cogulla. Besides the numerous parishes served by the Calced Augustinians, they possessed several educational institutions: a superior and intermediate school at Vigan (Villa Fernandina) with 209 students, an orphanage and trade school at Tambohn near Manila, with 145 orphans, etc. Because of the disturbances, the schools and missions were deserted; six Augustinian priests were killed and about 200 imprisoned and some of them harshly treated. Those who escaped unmolested fled to the principal house at Manila, to Macao, to Han-kou, to South America, or to Mexico. Up to the beginning of 1900, 46 Calced and 120 Discalced Augustinians had been imprisoned. Upon their release, they returned to the few monasteries still left them in the islands or set out for Spain, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Argentina and China. The province of the United States sent some members to supply the vacancies in the Philippines. The Monastery of St. Paul, at Manila, had 24 priests and 6 lay brothers back in 1900; that at Ceb√∫, 5 members of the order, that at Iloilo, on the island of Panay, 11 priests and 2 lay brothers, while in the 10 residences there were 20 priests; so that in 1900 there were only 68 Calced Augustinians in the islands. In all, the \\"Provincia Ss. Nominis Jesu Insularum Philippinarum\\", including theological students and the comparatively small number of lay brothers, had 600 members in 1900: 359 being in Spain, 185 of whom were priests; 68 in the Philippines; 29 in China (before their later expulsion) ; 26 in Colombia; 49 in Peru; 42 in Brazil; 27 in Argentina. The Order in the 21st century still has responsibility for one of the oldest churches in the Philippines, the Basilica del Santo Ni√±o de Cebu in Cebu. Before the Philippine Revolution of 1898, which accelerated the separation of church and state in the Philippines, the Augustinians conducted more than 400 schools and churches there and had pastoral care for some 2,237,000 Filipinos, including 328 village missions. The Philippine Revolution of 1896 cost the order its heaviest losses in the entire 19th century, breaking the historic connection with, or destroying the majority of its established works there. This included the removal of friars from 194 parishes, the capture of 122 friars by Filipino revolutionaries and the deprivation of income from 240 friars. Many Spanish Augustinians were forced to leave the country for Spain or Latin America, repopulating the Augustinian houses in Spain and reinforcing Augustinian missionary work in South America. In 1904 members of the order belonging to the Philippine province established the University of San Agustin in Iloilo City, Philippines. They have also since established schools such as the Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod in Negros Occidental (1962), the Colegio San Agustin, Makati (1969) and the Colegio San Agustin, Bi√±an in Bi√±an, Laguna (1985). In 1968 friars of the Philippine province re-established the Augustinian presence on the Indian subcontinent. In 2004 the all-Filipino Augustinian Province of Cebu celebrated its twentieth year of existence. It has 85 members in final vows with 19 in simple profession. There are 12 priories including a mission on Socorro Island.c.f. Augustinians in the Philippines Augnet historical information The Order of friars is again growing in the Philippines. The Augustinian Recollects are also present in the Philippines. Asia =China= The first Western major work on the history of China was by Augustinian friar Juan Gonz√°lez de Mendoza. It was a description of a visit to China by three others (including another Augustinian friar), and included the first known depiction of Chinese characters in Western publishing. In 1585 he published it at Rome in Spanish. Martin de Hereda and Hieronymus penetrated into the interior of China in 1577, to study Chinese literature with the intention of bringing it into Europe. Antonius Aug. Georgius (d. 1797) composed the \\"Alphabetum Tibetanum\\" for the use of missionaries. Agostino Ciasca (d. 1902), titular Archbishop of Larissa and cardinal, established a special faculty for Oriental languages at the Roman Seminary, published an Arabic translation of Tatian's \\"Diatessaron\\" and wrote \\"Bibliorum Fragmenta Copto-Sahidica\\". Dionysius of Borgo San Sepolcro (d. 1342), Bishop of Monopoli in Lower Italy, is the author of a commentary on the \\"Factorum et dictorum memorabilium libri IX\\" of Valerius Maximus, and was also much esteemed for his talents as poet, philosopher, and orator. The missionaries of the order have also given us valuable descriptive works on foreign countries and peoples. In about 1681, the Filipino Augustinian Alvaro de Benevente arrived in China and established the first of the Augustinian houses in China at Kan-chou. Benevente was made bishop and became head of the newly created Vicariate of Kiang-si in 1699. The Augustinian missionaries had success in propagating Catholicism, but in 1708, during the Chinese Rites controversy they were forced to withdraw from China. Portuguese Augustinians also served in the colonial port of Macau from 1586 until 1712. In 1879 Spanish Augustiniansc.f. Augustinians in China Augnet historical information from Manila (Elias Suarez and Agostino Villanueva) entered China to re-establish an Augustinian mission. In 1891 there were only 219 Christians and 11 catechumens, as well as 29 schools, with 420 children and 750 orphans. In 1900 the order possessed the mission of Northern Hu-nan, China, where there were 24 members, 2 of whom were natives; 6 were in the district of Yo-chou; 6 in the district of Ch'ang-te; 9 in the district of Li- chu; three other religious were also labouring in other districts‚Äîall under the vicar Apostolic, then Mgr. Perez. The 1900 mission comprised about 3000 baptized Christians and 3500 catechumens in a population of 11 million. In 1900 there were also two priests at the mission house at Han-kou and two at the procuration house at Shang-hai (Yang-tsze-poo Road, 10). By 1910 the Augustinian mission had 24 members of the order, two were indigenous Chinese. By 1947 the Augustinian mission counted 24,332 baptised Catholics as well as 3,250 preparing for baptism. They had established 20 major churches and 90 satellite churches. By that time there were 25 Chinese-born priests. All foreign missionaries were expelled or imprisoned from 1953 by the Communist government. Chinese-born Augustinians were dispersed by government order and directed not to live the monastic life. Church officials were arrested, schools and other church institutions closed or confiscated by the State. Many priests, religious brothers and sisters, as well as leaders among the Christian laity were sent to labour camps. One of the last of the pre- Revolution Chinese Augustinians was the Rev. Dai O.S.A.. He died in 2003. *Latest Information: Since the re-unification of the former colonies of Macau and Hong-Kong with the central Chinese government and further developments in government religious policy, Roman Catholicism in China‚Äîincluding clergy, Roman Catholic bishops, and a Cardinal‚Äîonce again exists openly alongside the members of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and their co- religionists in the continuing underground Church. The Augustinian have recently re-established friendly relations with Chinese educational organisations through school-placement programmesc.f. Australian Augustinian School Principal from St. Augustine's College, Brookvale visits China Augnet News in 2003 as well as through the University of the Incarnate Word Chinese campus founded by the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word. While there are Chinese Augustinian friars, there is not yet a priory in mainland China re-established. =India= After an extensive period of expansion in India from the 15th centuryc.f. Augustinians in India Augnet historical information the Portuguese Augustinians had not only established the order but also provided sixteen Indian bishops between 1579 and 1840. The order subsequently disappeared in India, cut off from its usual governance after the suppression of Portuguese monasteries in 1838, and the friars were forced to become secular priests. The order had failed successfully to establish itself as an autonomous indigenous Indian foundation. However, the Augustinians were re-established by Andr√©s G. Ni√±o, OSA, Spanish Augustinian, named coordinator of the project by the General Chapter of the Order in 1971 .... (cf., Estudio Agustiniano, 45 (2010) 279-303) ....... and the Indian Augustinians took on further responsibilities in Kerala in 2005.c.f. Augustinian news Indian Augustinians Augustinians.org.au The Indian delegation currently has 16 ordained friars and 8 in simple vows. The order is growing numerically in India. =Iran= The missionary history of Iran (Persia) also mentions the Augustinians. Towards the close of the sixteenth century, Aleixo de Menezes, Count of Cantanheda (d. 1617), a member of the order, appointed Archbishop of Goa in 1595, and of Braga in 1612, Primate of the East Indies, and several times Viceroy of India, sent several Augustinians as missionaries to Iran (Persia) while he himself laboured for the reunion of the Thomas Christians, especially at the Synod of Diamper, in 1599, and for the conversion of the Muslims and the non-Christians of Malabar. =Japan= Despite a vigorous early Christian foundation in Nagasaki by Jesuits, Franciscans and Filipino Augustiniansc.f. Augustinians in Japan Augnet.org and the many 17th century Japanese Augustinian martyrs, the earlier Augustinian mission attempts eventually failed after the repression of Tokugawa Hidetada (ruled 1605‚Äì1623; second Tokugawa shogun of Japan) and the expulsion of Christians under Tokugawa Iemitsu (ruled 1623 to 1651; third Tokugawa shogun of Japan). The Augustinian missions in the Philippines provided missionaries for the East since their first establishment. In 1602 some of them penetrated into Japan, where several were martyred around the 1607 during a period of Christian persecution. Among the martyred, Augustinians include: Ferdinand of Saint Joseph, Andrew Yoshida, Peter Zu√±iga, John Shozaburo, Michael Kiuchi Tayemon, Peter Kuhieye, Thomas Terai Kahioye, Mancio Seisayemon, Lawrence Hachizo, Bartholomew Guitierrez, Vincent of Saint Anthony, Francis of Jesus, Martin of Saint Nicholas Lumbreras and Melchior of Saint Augustine S√°nchez, and Thomas ‚ÄúKintsuba‚Äù Jihyoe of Saint Augustine. The Augustinian Martyrs of Japan collectively celebrate their feast day on September 28. Augustinian Ferdinand of Saint Joseph, along with Andrew Yoshida, a catechist who worked with him, were beheaded in 1617. Peter Z√∫niga was burned to death in 1622. Br. John Shozaburo, Oblates Michael Kiuchi Tayemon, Peter Kuhieye, Thomas Terai Kahioye, and Tertiaries Mancio Scisayemon and Lawrence Hachizo were beheaded in 1630. Bartholomew Gutierrez, Vincent of Saint Anthony Simoens, Francis of Jesus Terrero, Martin of St. Nicholas Lumbreras and Melchior of St. Augustine S√°nchez were burned to death in 1632. Thomas Jihyoe of Saint Augustine in 1637 was hung by his feet with his head inserted into a pit of rotting garbage until he died. In 1653 others entered China, where, in 1701, the order had six missionary stations before their expulsion. However, American Augustinian friars returned to Japan in 1954, symbolically establishing their first priory in 1959 at Nagasaki (also site of the second atomic bomb dropped on August 13, 1945). They then established priories in Fukuoka (1959), Nagoya (1964), and Tokyo (1968). As of 2006, there are seven United States Augustinian friars and five Japanese Augustinian friars. Early Japanese Augustinian leaders, including St Magdalen of Nagasaki and St Thomas Jihyoe are venerated as saints. =Korea= The Augustinian Recollects are also present in Korea, but for the Augustinian friars, the Region of Korea was founded in 1985 by Australian, English and Scottish friars. Filipinos later replaced the UK friars. As of 2006 there are 5 Koreans professed in the order and 12 in formation.c.f.Augustinians in KoreaAugnet historical information The order of friars is growing numerically in Korea. *Latest Statistics: As of 2006 (and not counting Spanish Augustinian priories) there were more than 21 other Augustinian houses across the Philippines, India, Korea, Japan, and Indonesia, with more than 140 friars in solemn vows and more than 40 in simple vows. The order of friars is growing in Asia. Europe In its most flourishing state at the beginning of the 14th century AD, the order in Europe had forty-two provinces (besides the two vicariates of India and Moravia) with 2,000 monasteries and about 30,000 members.c.f. Augustino Lubin Orbis Augustinianus sive conventuum O. Erem. S. A. chorographica et topographica descriptio, Paris, 1659, 1671, 1672 The Canons Regular and the Augustinian Recollects also have considerable history in Europe. *Latest statistics: As of 2006 there were 148 active Augustinian priories in Europe, including Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Ireland, England, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain and Spanish houses in the Philippines. This includes 1,031 friars in solemn vows, and 76 in simple vows. =England= In England and Ireland of the 14th century the Augustinian order had had over 800 friars, but these priories had declined (for other reasons) to around 300 friars before the anti-clerical laws of the Reformation Parliament and the Act of Supremacy. The friaries were dispersed from 1538 in the dissolution of monasteries during the English Reformation. The martyr St John Stone was one of the few British Augustinians to publicly defy the will of Henry VIII in this matter. The partial List of monasteries dissolved by Henry VIII of England alone includes 19 Augustinian houses. The Augustinians were re-established in England in the 1860s with the creation of the Augustinian priory, church and school of St Monica in Hoxton Square, London, N1 (architect: E. W. Pugin) built 1864‚Äì66.'Hoxton - St Monica's Priory ' in Taking Stock: Catholic Churches of England and Wales, online resource, accessed 28 December 2016 Clare Priory ‚Äì one of the houses dissolved by King Henry VIII ‚Äì was re-acquired by the order in 1953, with help from the family who then owned it. =Spain= A significant Augustinian missionary college was established at the former Spanish capital of Valladolid in 1759‚Äîand this house was exempted from the suppression of monastic houses in Spain c.1835, later becoming the centre of restoration for the order in Spain. In 1885 Filipino Augustinians took charge of the famous Escorial, and friars continue to administer it today. The modern Augustinian province of Spain was refounded in 1926‚Äîlargely through Spanish and Filipino friars from the Philippines‚Äîbut that was not the end of difficulty for the order in Spain. During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39) ninety eight Augustinians were murdered‚Äîsixty five friars from the Escorial alone were executed. Many of the discalced Augustinian nuns of Valencia were also put to death. As of 2006 there were 177 Spanish Augustinian friars, with 23 in simple profession.c.f. Augustinians in Spain [ International Order of St. Augustine] =Ireland= The English Province of the Order of Saint Augustine founded their first house in Dublin some time before 1280, and for a considerable time the Augustinians of Ireland were all English, effectively serving the English settlers in Ireland. Great Connell Priory was founded about 1202. Ballybeg Priory of St. Thomas √† Becket, was founded by Phillip de Barry in 1229 for the Canons Regular of St. Augustine. However, by the mid 14th century thirteen houses of the order had been established in Ireland. The Irish branch was relatively poor, and very few of the indigenous Irish friars were sent to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge for their education (unlike the English Augustinians). The fortunes of the Irish order changed in 1361 when Lionel, the second son of King Edward III, became viceroy of Ireland. He favoured the order, and soon established an Augustinian professor of theology based at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and the Irish order then grew significantly until the time of the English Reformation. In Ireland after the Reformation Parliament that began in 1529, the Augustinian houses in Leinster, Munster, Dublin, Dungarvan and Drogheda were soon suppressed. The houses in Ardnaree, Ballinrobe, Ballyhaunis, Banada and Murrisk managed to remain functioning until 1610. By decree in 1542 the English parliament had allowed the Augustinian community at Dunmore in County Galway, Ireland to continue. After 1610 the Dunmore community was the only surviving foundation, and in 1620 the Irish Province of the Augustinians was given pastoral charge of both England (where all houses had been forcibly closed) and Ireland. Irish Augustinian students were sent to the Continent to study, and the Irish Augustinians continued their work in Ireland under the harsh English Penal laws designed to protect the establishment of the Church of England. A number were executed‚Äîincluding William Tirry OSA (executed 1654 for saying mass). In 1656, in response to the persecution at home, Pope Alexander VII established the Irish Augustinians in Rome in the church and priory of San Matteo in Merulana. Many Augustinians though remained in Ireland. One such Bishop John Sleyne O.S.A was administrator in commendam and last Prior of Ballybeg Priory. In 1751 Augustine Cheevers, an Irish Augustinian, was made Bishop of Ardagh. Others left to work in America and after the 1830s to Australia. After the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829, the order began to re-organise more openly in Ireland. The Irish friars took the order back to England, establishing a priory at Hoxton, London in 1864. They further turned their attention to Nigeria, Australia, America and missionary work. The contemporary Irish order conducts parishes, a school in Dungarvan (founded 1874), a school in New Ross and special ministries in Ireland. Contemporary Ireland is undergoing rapid change, and this presents challenges to the order there. Many Irish emigrants (including Augustinian friars) are now returning. Over 40,000 immigrants each year are admitted to keep the Irish economy working, and many are coming from the new Eastern European members of the European Union. For example, there are now over 100,000 Poles in the country as well as asylum seekers from Africa and the Balkan countries. =Europe (setbacks)= Many European Augustinian priories and foundations suffered serious setbacks (including suppression and destruction) from the various periods of anti-clericalism during the Reformation and other historical events such as the French Revolution, the Spanish civil war (among more than 6,000 clergy, 155 Spanish Augustinians were killed),The statistics come from Historia de la Persecuci√≥n Religiosa en Espa√±a (1936‚Äì1939) by Antonio Montero Moreno (Biblioteca de Autores Cristianos, 3rd edition, 1999) the two World Wars and Communist repression. French-speaking lands The order of friars in Spain and France has had an eventful history, from being part of the Grand Union, through the periods of extensive Spanish colonisation, the French Revolution, the effects of the Napoleonic wars, the War of the Spanish Succession, suppression of the order, the Spanish Civil War, and then Francisco Franco. German-speaking lands The successful German branch, which until 1299 was counted as one province, was then divided into four provinces. These provinces produced significant Augustinian leaders and reformers. These included the most famous German Augustinian theologian before the Augustinian Martin Luther: Andreas Proles (d. 1503), the founder of the Union or Congregation of the Observant Augustinian Hermits, organized after strict principles; Johann von Paltz, the famous Erfurt professor and pulpit-orator (d. 1511); Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen (d. 1532); as well as Johann von Staupitz, Luther's monastic superior and Wittenberg colleague (d. 1524). Reforms were also introduced into the extra-German branches of the order, but a long time after Proles's reform and in connection with the Counter- Reformation of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Augustinian credentials of Martin Luther did not prevent anti-clerical attacks on the order during the Reformation, and neither did it enhance the order's political influence within the Catholic Church during the Counter-Reformation. A number of mathematicians, astronomers, and musicians are also found among the members of the order, but it was the great scientist Johann Gregor Mendel, abbot of the Czech monastery of St. Thomas at Old Brno in Moravia (d. 1884) who gave great credit to the Augustinian Order's scholarship in the 19th century. He was the discoverer of the Mendelian laws of heredity and hybridization. =Growth or decline of the order internationally= 1914 tour group led by Blasius Zeiser, OSA, on the deck of RMS Carpathia. Given that the Roman Catholic Church in the Western world has been experiencing a decline in vocations to the priesthood and religious life since the 1960s, a relatively simple way to assess the vigour of this order is to compare the numbers of those in solemn profession (vows) with those in simple profession. For a mendicant order such as the Augustinians, the most formal and significant commitments are the permanent and lifelong vows of Solemn profession. Ordination is considered a separate matter, and though most are, the Augustinian friar may or may not be ordained priest or deacon. Those in simple profession are the newer members of the order, but have agreed to make a serious commitment (temporary, but with a view to permanent commitment), and been formally accepted as suitable by senior members of the order to make that formal commitment. The figures quoted do not include aspirants to the order who have not reached the significant step of simple profession. The details of the median age of friars in respective national grouping is another way of assessing the vigour of the order, but these details are not included here. They may be found on the order's international website. Likewise, the growth of lay organisations of Augustinian spirituality is another (less-precise) way of measuring the vigour of the order. =Extension= The Bull \\"Licet ecclesiae catholicae\\" mentions the hermit convents that had been invited to take part in the proceedings at Rome, in 1256, which led to the union. \\"Quaedam [domus] S. Guillelmi, quaedam S. Augustini ordinum, nonnullae autem fratris Joannis Boni, aliquae vero de Fabali, aliae vero de Britinis.\\" According to this statement, the original branches of the hermits were: * The Williamites, founded by St. William of Maleval shortly before his death in 1157. From this congregation sprang two others, the principal houses being at Stabulum Rodis, in the valley of Maleval, and at Fabali on Monte Fabali. The mode of life, originally very severe, was mitigated by Pope Gregory IX, under whom the majority of the Williamite monasteries adopted the Rule of St. Benedict. When these were required by the Bull \\"Licet ecclesiae catholicae\\" to join the new order, they raised objections and obtained a prohibition to exchange the Benedictine Rule for the milder one of the Augustinians. (See Guil. De Waha, \\"Explanatio vitae S. Guillelmi Magni\\" etc., 1693; \\"Acta Sanct. Boll.\\", Feb., II, 450 sqq.; \\"Kirchenlex.\\", 2nd ed., XII, 1609 sqq.) * Several unspecified houses of the Order of St. Augustine, established chiefly in Italy, and forming separate congregations. To these belong the Hermits of the Holy Trinity in Tuscany, who had already been united into an Augustinian congregation by Pope Innocent IV, in 1243, with Cardinal Richard for a protector, and with indulgences granted to those who visited their churches (in 1244). * The Bonites, so called from their founder, Blessed John Buoni, a member of the Buonuomini family, born about 1168 in Mantua. He lived a hermit's life at Cesena, and died in his native city in 1249 (Lodi, \\"Vita e miracoli del b. Giov. Buoni\\", Mantua, 1591; \\"Acta SS. Boll.\\", Oct., IX, 693 sq.). In the year 1256 the Bonites possessed eleven monasteries and gave the first general to the Augustinian Order (see above). * The Brittinians (Brictinians), so called from their oldest foundation, that of St. Blasius de Brittinis, near Fano, in the Marche district of Ancona. Many congregations, such as the Brothers of Penance of Christ (Saccati, or \\"Sack-bearers\\"), the foundations of Durandus of Huesca (Osca), and those of the \\"Catholic Poor\\", united with the Bonites. The Hermits of St. Augustine spread rapidly, partly because they did not radiate from a single parent monastery, and partly because, after violent conflicts in the previously existing congregations, the active life was finally adopted by the greater number of communities, following the example of the Friars Minor and the Dominicans. To the Brittinians alone, in 1260, was granted permission to continue following the contemplative life. A few years after the reorganization of the Augustinian Order, Hermit monasteries sprang up in Germany, France and Spain. Germany soon possessed forty, many of them large and important, such as those at Mainz, W√ºrzburg, Worms, Nuremberg, Speyer, Strasburg, Ratisbon, all built between 1260 and 1270. As early as the year 1299, the German province was divided into four sub-provinces: the Rhenish-Swabian, the Cologne, the Bavarian and the Saxon. At the period of its greatest prosperity the order comprised 42 ecclesiastical provinces and 2 vicariates numbering 2000 monasteries and about 30,000 members. (Cf. Aug. Lubin, \\"Orbis Augustinianus sive conventuum O. Erem. S. A. chorographica et topographica descriptio\\", Paris, 1659, 1671, 1672.) This modern Latin Rite branch is active in society (i.e. not enclosed) and it is counted comprehensively in the article below. It is headed by the international Prior-General in Rome, and while spiritually and historically connected is now canonically separate from the other Independent Augustinian communities such as the Discalced Augustinians, Augustinian nuns, and the Augustinian Recollects. =Priories= The modern order of friars (Under the Prior General in Rome) is associated with the United Nations as a Non- Governmental Organization and maintains a full-time representative to the United Nations. Worldwide there are nearly 2,800 Augustinian friars working in: * Algeria * Argentina * Austria * Australia * Belgium * Benin * Bolivia * Brazil * Canada * Chile * China * Colombia * Dem. Rep.

These reformers were themselves Augustinians and instituted several reformed congregations, each having its own vicar-general (vicarius-generalis), but all under the control of the general of the order. The most important of these congregations of the \\"Regular Observants\\" were those of Illiceto, in the district of Siena, established in 1385. They initially had 12, and subsequently 8, convents. St. John ad Carbonariam (founded c. 1390) had 14 convents, Perugia (1491), had 11, and the Lombardic Congregation (1430) had 56. The Congregation of the Spanish Observance (1430) included all the Castilian monasteries from 1505. The reform of Monte Ortono near Padua (1436) had 6 convents, the Regular Observants of the Blessed Virgin at Genoa (also called Our Lady of Consolation (c. 1470) had 25. The Regular Observants of Apulia (c. 1490) had 11; the Congregation of Zampani in Calabria (1507) had 40. The German (or Saxon) Congregation (1493) flourished; the Dalmatian Congregation (1510) had 6, the Congregation of the Colorites (of Monte Colorito in Calabria (1600) had 11. At Centorbio in Sicily (1590) there were 18, and the \\"Little Augustinians\\" of Bourges, France (c. 1593) had 20. The Spanish, Italian and French congregations of Discalced, or Barefooted, Augustinians were successful (see below), and the Congregation del Bosco in Sicily established in the year 1818 had 3 convents. Among these reformed congregations, besides those of the Barefooted Augustinians, the most important was the German (Saxon) Congregation. As in Italy, Spain and France, reforms were begun as early as the fifteenth century in the four German provinces existing since 1299. Johannes Zachariae, an Augustinian monk of Eschwege, Provincial of the Order from 1419 to 1427 and professor of theology at the University of Erfurt, began a reform in 1492. Andreas Proles, prior of the Himmelpforten Monastery, near Wernigerode, strove to introduce the reforms of Heinrich Zolter in as many Augustinian monasteries as possible. Proles, aided by Simon Lindner of Nuremberg and other zealous Augustinians, worked indefatigably till his death, in 1503, to reform the Saxon monasteries, even calling in the assistance of the secular ruler of the country. As the result of his efforts, the German, or Saxon, Reformed Congregation, recognized in 1493, comprised nearly all the important convents of the Augustinian Hermits in Germany. Johann von Staupitz, his successor as vicar of the congregation, followed in his footsteps. Staupitz had been prior at T√ºbingen, then at Munich, and had taken a prominent part in founding the University of Wittenberg in 1502, where he became a professor of theology and the first dean of that faculty. He continued to reform the order with the zeal of Proles, as well as in his spirit and with his methods. He collected the \\"Constitutiones fratrum eremitarum S. August. ad apostolicorum privilegiorum formam pro Reformatione Alemanniae\\", which were approved in a chapter held at Nuremberg in 1504. A printed copy of these is still to be seen in the university library of Jena. Supported by the general of the order, Aegidius of Viterbo, he obtained a papal brief (15 March 1506), granting independence under their own vicar-general to the reformed German congregations and furthermore, 15 December 1507, a papal Bull commanding the union of the Saxon province with the German Congregation of the Regular Observants. All the Augustinian convents of Northern Germany were, in accordance with this decree, to become parts of the regular observance. But when, in 1510, Staupitz commanded all the hermits of the Saxon province to accept the regular observance on pain of being punished as rebels, and to obey him as well as the general of the order, and, on 30 September, published the papal Bull at Wittenberg, seven convents refused to obey, among them that of Erfurt, of which Martin Luther was a member‚ÄîLuther seems to have gone to Rome on this occasion as a representative of the rebellious monks. Because of this appeal to Rome, the consolidation did not take place. Staupitz also continued to favour Luther even after this. They had become acquainted at Erfurt, during a visitation, and Staupitz was responsible for Luther's summons to Wittenberg in 1508; yet even after 1517 he entertained friendly sentiments for Luther, looking upon his ideas as being motivated only against abuses. From 1519 on, he gradually turned away from Luther. Staupitz resigned his office of vicar-general of the German congregations in 1520. Wenzel Link, preacher at Nuremberg, former professor and dean of the theological faculty at Wittenberg, who was elected his successor, cast his lot with Luther, whose views were endorsed at a chapter of the Saxon province held in January, 1522, at Wittenberg. In 1523 Link resigned his office and became a Lutheran preacher at Altenberg, where he introduced the Reformation and married. In 1528 he went as preacher to Nuremberg, where he died in 1547. The examples of Luther and Link were followed by many Augustinians of the Saxon province, and their convents gradually became more and more deserted. The convent of Erfurt ceased to exist in 1525. German houses that remained in communion with Rome then united with the Lombardic Congregation. Many Augustinians in Germany opposed the Reformation by their writings and their sermons, such as Bartholom√§us Arnoldi of Usingen (d. 1532 at W√ºrzburg), who for thirty years was professor at Erfurt and one of Luther's teachers, Johannes Hoffmeister (d. 1547), Wolfgang Cappelmair (d. 1531) and Konrad Treger (d. 1542). The chief house of the order remains the International College of St. Monica at Rome, Via S. Uffizio No. 1. It is also the residence of the general of the order (prior generalis) and of the curia generalis. Another priory of the Augustinian order in Rome is that of S. Augustinus de Urbe, established in 1483, near the church of St. Augustine. It was there that the remains of St. Monica, the mother of St. Augustine, were deposited when they were brought from Ostia in the year 1430. This, formerly the chief priory of the order, was later occupied by the Italian Ministry of Marine, and the Augustinian friars who serve the church retained only a small portion of their former property. Another Augustinian priory in Rome is S. Maria de Populo de Urbe. In 1331 Pope John XXII had appointed the Augustinian Hermits guardians of the tomb of St. Augustine in the Church of S. Pietro in Ciel d'Oro at Pavia. They were driven from there in 1700, and evacuated to Milan. Their priory was destroyed in 1799, the church desecrated, and the remains of St. Augustine were taken back to Pavia and placed in its cathedral. The church of S. Pietro was restored, and on 7 October 1900, the body of the saint and Doctor of the church was removed from the cathedral and replaced in San Pietro‚Äîan event commemorated in a poem by Pope Leo XIII. The Augustinians were subsequently restored their old church of S. Pietro. =Organization of the order= Government The Order of St Augustine, while following the rule known as that of St. Augustine, are also subject to the Constitutions drawn up by Augustinus Novellus (d. 1309), prior general of the order from 1298 to 1300, and by Clement of Osimo. The Rule and Constitutions were approved at the general chapter held at Florence in 1287 and at Ratisbon in 1290. A revision was made at Rome in 1895. The Constitutions have frequently been printed: at Rome, in 1581, and, with the commentary of Girolamo Seripando, at Venice, in 1549, and at Rome, in 1553. The newly revised Constitutions were published at Rome in 1895, with additions in 1901 and 1907. The government of the order is as follows: At the head is the prior general. Currently, the prior general is Alejandro Moral, OSA, who was elected in September 2013. The prior general is elected every six years by the general chapter. The prior general is aided by six assistants and a secretary, also elected by the general chapter. These form the Curia Generalitia. Each province is governed by a provincial, each commissariate by a commissary general, each of the two congregations by a vicar-general, and every monastery by a prior (only the Czech monastery of Alt-Brunn, in Moravia, is under an abbot) and every college by a rector. The members of the order are divided into priests and brothers. The Augustinians, like most religious orders, have a cardinal protector. =The habit= The choir and outdoor dress of the monks is of black woollen material, with long, wide sleeves, a black leather cincture and a long pointed capuche reaching to the cincture. The indoor dress consists of a black habit with capuche and cincture. In many Augustinian houses white is used in Summer and also worn in public, usually in places where there were no Dominicans. Shoes and out of doors (prior to Vatican II) a black hat or biretta completed the habit. =Modern distribution= As of 2006 there were 148 active Augustinian priories in Europe, including Germany, Belgium, Poland, Ireland, England, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, Malta, Spain and Spanish houses in the Philippines. This includes 1,031 friars in solemn vows, and 76 in simple vows. The order established the first of their Canadian houses at Tracadie, Nova Scotia in Canada in 1938. Among other Canadian foundations, the order also established a significant priory and St. Thomas of Villanova College in Toronto. The order, by 2006 has since professed many native Canadians. As of 2006 there were more than 70 Augustinian priories in the United States and Canada with 386 friars in solemn vows and 16 in simple vows. In Central and South America, the Augustinians remain established in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela as well three Peruvian Vicariates of Iquitos, Apur√≠mac and Chulucanas, and the Province of Peru. There are currently 814 friars in Latin America. As of 2006, there were more than 30 other Augustinian priories in Nigeria, Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and Algeria, with over 85 friars in solemn vows, and more than 60 in simple vows. There are also Augustinians working in the Republic of Benin, Togo, Madagascar, Guinea and Burkina. The Augustinian order in the Region of Korea was founded in 1985 by Australian, English and Scottish friars. Filipinos later replaced the UK friars. As of 2006 there are 5 Koreans professed in the order and 12 in formation.C.F. Augustinians in Korea.Augnet historical information As of 2006 there were 11 Augustinian priories in Australia with 36 friars in solemn vows, and one in simple vows. The order of friars is in numerical decline in Australia while affiliated orders are growing. As of 2006 (and not counting Spanish Augustinian priories) there were more than 21 other Augustinian houses across the Philippines, India, Korea, Japan, and Indonesia, with more than 140 friars in solemn vows and more than 40 in simple vows.  Legacy and impact  The work of the Augustinians includes teaching, scientific study, parish and pastoral work (cure of souls) and missions. =Teaching= The history of education makes frequent mention of Augustinians who distinguished themselves particularly as professors of philosophy and theology at the great universities of Salamanca, Coimbra, Alcal√°, Padua, Pisa, Naples, Oxford, Paris, Vienna, Prague, W√ºrzburg, Erfurt, Heidelberg, and Wittenberg, amongst others. Others taught successfully in the schools of the order, which controlled a number of secondary schools, colleges, and other educational institutions. In 1685 the Bishop of W√ºrzburg, Johann Gottfried II, confided to the care of the Augustinians the parish and the gymnasium of Munnerstadt in Lower Franconia (Bavaria), a charge that they still retain; connected with the monastery of St. Michael in that place is a monastic school, while the seminary directed by the Augustinians forms another convent, that of St. Joseph. From 1698 to 1805 there existed an Augustinian gymnasium at Bedburg in the district of Cologne. The order possesses altogether fifteen colleges, academies and seminaries in Italy, Spain and America. The chief institutions of this kind in Spain are that at Valladolid and that in the Escorial. =Augustinian devotional practices= The particular devotional practices connected with the Augustinian Order, and which it has striven to propagate, include the veneration of the Blessed Virgin under the title of \\"Mother of Good Counsel\\" (Mater Boni Consilii), whose miraculous picture is to be seen in the Augustinian church at Genazzano in the Roman province. This devotion has spread to other churches and countries, and confraternities have been formed to encourage it.Sources quoted from the Marian Library/International Marian Research Institute, Dayton, Ohio 45469-1390Udayton.edu Several periodicals dedicated to the honour of Our Lady of Good Counsel are published in Italy, Spain and Germany by the Augustinians (cf. Meschler on the history of the miraculous picture of Genazzano in \\"Stimmen aus Maria-Laach\\", LXVII, 482 sqq.). Besides this devotion, the order traditionally fostered the Archconfraternity of Our Lady of Consolation. Traditionally, the girdle confraternity, members of which wear a blessed girdle of black leather in honour of Saints Augustine, Monica and Nicholas of Tolentino, recite daily thirteen Our Fathers and Hail Marys and the Salve Regina, fast strictly on the eve of the feast of St. Augustine, and received Holy Communion on the feasts of the three above-named saints. This confraternity was founded by Pope Eugene IV at San Giacomo, Bologna, in 1439, made an archconfraternity by Gregory XIII, in 1575, aggregated to the Augustinian Order, and favoured with indulgences. The Augustinians, with the approbation of Pope Leo XIII, also encourage the devotion of the Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel and the propagation of the Third Order of St. Augustine for the laity, as well as the veneration of Augustine and his mother Monica, to instil the Augustinian spirit of prayer and self-sacrifice into their parishioners. =Notable figures= The Augustianian Order has produced a number of notable members, especially theologians and writers, including: * Ugolino da Gualdo Cattaneo (d. 1260), founder of the convent of Gualdo Cattaneo. *Clemente da Osimo (d. 1291), a reformer of the Order. *Nicholas of Tolentino (d. 1305), a mystic. *James of Viterbo, (d. 1308), Archbishop of Benevento and Archbishop of Naples.

Biography = Military career = Domazet-Lo≈°o graduated from all the Yugoslav People's Army schools, including the Military Academy, and started his military career in the Yugoslav Navy. Domazet-Lo≈°o (then a captain) defected to the Croatian Army in autumn 1991. He became actively involved in military operations and organized the military intelligence services. He became the head of the Office for Strategic Research (1991), and the head of the Intelligence Service of the Croatian Army Headquarters (1992). In 1992, he and Ante Gotovina were the chief commanders of the Livno front and the large area of military operations covering the northern and central Dalmatia, southern Bosnia and Herzegovina. His biggest strategic successes include the planning of major operations in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (Operation Flash, Operation Storm, Operation South Move) and the fight against enemy intelligence, as well as the incursions into the enemy camp - the most spectacular being the wiretapping of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in his Belgrade headquarters. He continued his career in the Croatian Army, becoming a rear admiral and finally an admiral in 2000. He served as the Deputy Chief of Staff and the Chief of Staff (1998‚Äì2000). After retirement Domazet-Lo≈°o was forced into retirement in 2000, after he and eleven other generals signed an open letter accusing the Croatian president Stjepan Mesiƒá of participating in the attempt to denigrate and criminalize the Croatian War of Independence and its participants. Later he became one of the leaders of a political party, Croatian True Revival. Ever since his days in the Yugoslav Army, Domazet-Lo≈°o has been publishing numerous expert articles on the issues of war, navy and submarines. He is a prominent military analyst in the area of geostrategy. His most important work in that area is Hrvatska i veliko rati≈°te (Croatia and the Large Front, 2002). He published his last two books, Gospodari kaosa (Masters of Chaos), in 2005 and Klonovi nastupaju (Clones perform), in 2007. Domazet-Lo≈°o was interrogated by the representatives of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in 2002. In December 2010, Amnesty International stated that, based on the May 2008 trial judgment of Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac regarding war crimes committed by Croatian soldiers in the Operation Medak Pocket, Domazet- Lo≈°o and his superior Janko Bobetko had command responsibility and should be prosecuted. In January 2011 the Ministry of Justice reported that \\"inquests are being made\\" in the case of Domazet-Lo≈°o, but noted that the ICTY transferred files related to him saying they had a \\"lack of evidence\\" to bring forth a case. Domazet-Lo≈°o then held a press conference in which he rejected these accusations calling them pressure on Croatia in its process of accession to the European Union.

Anecdotes from history and de Camp's travels to some of the locales he writes about pepper the narrative. The first eight chapters fall into the first category. Discussions of Bronze Age Troy and the ancient Sudanese civilization of Kush counter romantic speculations with a resume of what is known of them from historical sources and archaeological investigations. In contrast, the section on King Arthur, of whom little factual information has been established, puts to rest unverified notions regarding him by tracing the development and elaboration of his legend down through the ages. The chapter on the Maya debunks diffusionist theories seeking the origin of their culture in Old World civilizations rather than from indigenous factors. Later sections about Teotihuacan and the Toltecs serve more as general introductions to these cultures. There is also a brief discussion of the Tour Magne, a Roman ruin in N√Æmes, France, and a chapter on myths that discounts them as reliable reportage of prehistoric events. Chapters in the second category include discussions of memories of previous lives supposedly recovered via hypnosis, the Kabbalah, lives of famous charlatans claiming to have been magicians, such as Cagliostro and Aleister Crowley, the hoax perpetrated by L√©o Taxil and others that purported to expose Freemasonry as devil worship, theosophist C. W. Leadbeater, the development of occultist cultism around Mount Shasta in Northern California (demonstrated to have a literary basis), and the origins of the mystic trance, with rational explanations for the visions experienced. A satirical chapter of advice on how to set one's self up as a prophet rounds out the section. An account of the early history of Fundamentalist movement to prohibit the teaching of evolution in schools leads off the third category. There is also a biography of Populist politician Ignatius Donnelly focusing on his speculations regarding Atlantis and like matters, and then a speculative chapter regarding future languages, essentially a didactic piece on language change with application to science fictional treatments of time-travel. It leads into a discussion of nonscientific claims about the \\"fourth dimension\\" in general. This part of the book also includes reviews of Immanuel Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision and Erich von D√§niken's Chariots of the Gods?, both of which de Camp discounts. Reception Critical reviews of the book were generally positive. Writing in the wake of its release, Tom Easton observed in Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact that \\"[i]f you know L. Sprague de Camp's work at all, you know what to expect ... He's always readable and entertaining, as he sticks his thumbs into gaping holes of fact and logic ... He's full of the straight dope (though he often doesn't go into things as deeply as I would like).\\" He urged readers to \\"buy the book.\\" Michael Schuyler, writing for Library Journal, took a more neutral stance, judging only that \\"[m]ost of these mysteries have been well documented elsewhere, and De Camp [sic] presents no revelations.\\"Schuyler, Michael. \\"Science and Technology. De Camp. L. Sprague. The Ragged Edge of Science\\" (review), in Library Journal, v. 105, no. 20, November 15, 1980, p. 2423. The book was also reviewed by Darrell Schweitzer in Science Fiction Review v. 10, issue 1 (Spring, 1981), p. 22. More recently, an exhaustive review from 2007 sums up the book as \\"a very pleasant and readable collection of essays, an excellent and classical example of skeptical writing and debunkery of various kinds of pseudoscientific and paranormal nonsense.\\" The reviewer notes de Camp's \\"accessible, down-to-earth style,\\" humor, and story-telling expertise, as well as \\"somewhat conservative opinions ... which occasionally show in his writing.\\" Its conclusion is \\"[o]verall I highly recommend this book.\\" Notes Category:1980 non-fiction books Category:Science books Category:Essay collections Category:Books by L.

The lyric \\"Blow the man down\\" most likely refers to a common mishap at sea during the age of sail wherein a strong, sudden gale catches a ship with its topsails fully set ‚Äì the force of the wind, depending upon the load and balance of the ship's cargo, can actually \\"blow the man down\\", or blow the man-o'-war down into the water, partially capsizing it. When this occurs during a violent storm, the result is almost always a loss of the ship, however there are techniques for righting the vessel in relatively calm positions (cutting free the sails and rigging dragging in the water). Historical  Contemporary publications and the memories of individuals, in later publications, put the existence of this shanty by the 1860s. The Syracuse Daily Courier, July 1867, quoted a lyric from the song, which was said to be used for hauling halyards on a steamship bound from New York to Glasgow.‚ÄúChalk and Charcoal ‚Äì Outlines of a Trip to Europe!‚Äù Syracuse Daily Courier (25 July 1867). In 1879, George Haswell was passenger aboard another steamship, from London to Sydney, at which time he noted some of the shanties of the crew. These were published in the ship's own fortnightly newspaper, The Parramatta Sun, and they included a full set of lyrics for \\"Blow the Man Down.\\" The lyrics take up the theme of a ship of the Black Ball Line, and include the refrains, \\"Wae! Hae! Blow the man down / Give me some time to blow the man down.\\"Seal, Graham. 1992. ‚ÄúTen Shanties Sung on the Australian Run 1879.‚Äù Antipodes Press. Although Haswell's article did not receive wide circulation, it did find its way into the hands of Laura Alexandrine Smith, whose own large collection of sailors' songs, The Music of the Waters (1888), was one of the first to be widely available. Smith reprinted the lyrics gathered by Haswell.Smith, Laura Alexandrine, The Music of the Waters, Kegan, Paul, Trench & Co. (1888). She also presented a different version of the song that she herself presumably collected, and which was said to be used for hoisting topsail yards. Its lyrics include reference to a sailor coming home to England from Hong Kong, as well as meeting a girl on \\"Winchester Street.\\" Lyrics Like most chanties of this type, \\"Blow the Man Down\\" was sung to a flexible combination of customary verses, floating verses from within the general chanty repertoire, and verses improvised in the moment or peculiar to individual singers. The song was of indefinite length, and created by supplying solo verses to an invariable two-part refrain. The structure is as follows: Solo verse couplets documented to have been sung to \\"Blow the Man Down\\" include the following from sailors of the 19th century. References in the lyrics Paradise Street is a street in Liverpool, England, that was frequented by sailors whose ships had docked at the port. A traditional explanation of its origins is that the Black Ballers were fast packet ships of the American Black Ball Line that sailed between New York and Liverpool towards the end of the 19th century. Sailors reached America about four weeks after leaving Liverpool and returned about three weeks later. The speedy journey meant that sailors were paid earlier than those on other lines, making the Black Ball ships very popular. Sailors were regularly beaten on these ships and being \\"blown down\\" meant getting knocked onto the deck floor as a result. It is unlikely that \\"Blow the Man Down\\" was peculiar to the port of Liverpool or the transatlantic trade. For example, versions from Tyneside sing of Chichester Street (in South Shields) or Collingwood Street (in Newcastle upon Tyne), both of which are thoroughfares that would be familiar to sailors from England's North-East coast. \\"Blown down\\" seems an unlikely reference in the context to being knocked to the deck for a perceived misdemeanour. Since the working members of the crew are using the phrase, it is more likely to refer to some heavy operation, such as raising a yard. This also fits in with the alternative wording \\"give me the strength\\" rather than \\"give me the time\\" to blow the (not \\"a\\") man down.  Another version  An article by Felix Riesenberg, who trained and served as an officer in the Merchant Marine in the 1890s, depicts earlier sailors singing these plainer work lyrics not specifically about the Black Ball line.Riesenberg, F. \\"When sailors were sailors\\" (first installment), Outing vol. 62 (1913) pp. 515‚Äì527 The men are raising the topsail on a merchant ship to get under sail from New York to Liverpool, with the chantey led by a sailor named Jimmie: In popular media Claude Choules, the last combatant of the First World War, can be heard playing the song in the first and third episodes of The Last Tommy. Sheldon and Penny sing the song together as a work song while making Penny Blossom hair accessories in the episode \\"The Work Song Nanocluster,\\" Season 2, Episode 18 of The Big Bang Theory.

It follows the life of an African-born Seattle bicycle officer simply known as \\"Z\\" for a week. While Z goes about on his policing duties, he finds himself mentally preoccupied with his girlfriend who has gone on a camping trip with an old male friend. This obsession with the absence of his girlfriend and the escalating jealousy and paranoia makes him unfazed by the crimes he witnesses, which take place in locations all over Seattle (including the Arboretum, Gasworks Park in Wallingford, and the Boeing factory in Renton) on different levels of depravity. The story is narrated by Z in his native Wolof language (the language of Senegal and parts of Mali, the Gambia, Cote d'Ivoire, and Mauritania), though he makes the transition to English when interacting with those around him. Police Beat provides an interesting glimpse into the life of a new immigrant to the United States that focuses less on the protagonist's experience as a new citizen and more on his response to life in an American city. His observation of both human vice and social outlook is contrasted with his conservative sense of duty, both to his work as a police officer and his relationship with his girlfriend. Based on real police reports that appeared in Charles Mudede's column \\"Police Beat\\" for the weekly The Stranger, the film also provides a snapshot of Seattle in the early 21st century.

Hazelwood North is so named due to its geographical orientation from the town \\"Hazelwood\\" - now known as Churchill, Victoria. Composed of mostly five acre blocks, the district functions primarily as a commuter town for those working in the nearby regional centres of Morwell and Traralgon.

Some of the other songs she was famous for are \\"–ü–æ–≤–µ–π, –≤–µ—Ç—Ä–µ\\" (\\"Blow, Oh Wind\\"), \\"–¢–æ–∑–∏ –¥–∏–≤–µ–Ω —Å–≤—è—Ç\\" (\\"This Wondrous World\\", a take on Czes≈Çaw Niemen's \\"Dziwny jest ten ≈õwiat\\") and \\"–Ø–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞\\" (\\"Yantra\\"). Her brief but meteoric career took off in the late 1960s. In the short time between 1967 and 1971, she won a number of prestigious awards at Bulgarian and international music festivals. She died young in a plane crash in 1971, pregnant with her second child. Life and career Pasha was born in Sofia in the residential district of Knyajevo to mother Lyubka and father Hristo. When she was five, her parents divorced. Her father got remarried to a woman named Tsvetana and received custody of Pasha, while her brother Ventsi remained with his mother. Pasha's second brother Krasimir is the child of her father's second marriage. Both Pasha and Krasimir were raised to call both mothers their own. They called them \\"mother Tsetska\\" and \\"mother Lyubka\\". Lyubka worked at the kindergarten they attended so both children were cared after by her there and by Tsetska at home. The children were also raised by their grandmother Parashkeva on their father's side. They called her \\"old mother\\". Pasha had a very close relationship with \\"old mother\\" (whom she was named after), who brought her up and enrolled her in violin lessons. While most people at the time called her Pepi (the usual diminutive for the names Petranka, Petya, Penka and the like), her grandmother, who was a great admirer of Pasha Angelina (a famous Soviet Stakhanovite of the Joseph Stalin era), gave her the nickname Pasha.–ú—É–∑–∏–∫–∞–ª–Ω–∏ —Å–ª–µ–¥–∏: –ü–∞—à–∞ –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∞. –¢–í –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è. (2006) Pasha was traumatized by her grandmother's death. They were very close and shared a bed. One morning she simply woke up in her grandmother's cold, stiff embrace. In subsequent teenage years, she would quarrel with her father and would occasionally spend a few days at her mother's home after an argument. Acquaintances described her as a very shy and modest girl. Having completed her secondary education, she started work as a draftswoman at the Balkancar electrocar factory. She married an engineer named Vasil Ivanov and they had a son Milen together. They drifted apart however and eventually separated (without an official divorce), after which Pasha took custody of the child. At that same time, Pasha auditioned for The Stage Singers School for the Bulgarian National Radio. She was accepted for her remarkable voice and despite a strong lisp that was subsequently treated surgically. With the help of her teacher, she found work as a soloist (after being denied a position in the Sofia Orchestra) in the Labour Corps Ensemble. Her first great success was at the 1967 Sochi festival in the Soviet Union, where she won first prize and a gold medal. In 1968 she was accepted into the Sofia Orchestra, and she worked with them for the rest of her career. The then-conductor and leader of the band, Nikolay \\"Bebo\\" Kuyumdzhiev, was soon replaced by Nikolay \\"Fucho\\" Arabadzhiev, with whom Pasha collaborated productively. He was a conductor, composer, pianist and clarinetist. They fell deeply in love and basically lived in a common law marriage until their deaths. She would spend the following years touring Bulgaria and various other countries, primarily in what was then the Soviet bloc. In 1970 she won third prize at the Golden Stag Festival in Bra≈üov, Romania, first prize for the song \\"–Ø–≤–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–ª–µ—Ç\\" (\\"Yavor Spring\\", yavor being a word for the sycamore tree and also a Bulgarian male name) (music by Svetozar Rusinov) in the radio competition \\"Spring\\", and at the all-Bulgarian Golden Orpheus Festival, the Grand Prize was awarded to \\"–ü–æ–≤–µ–π, –≤–µ—Ç—Ä–µ\\" and first prize to \\"–ï–¥–Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ —Ä–æ–∑–∞\\" (music by Dimitar Valchev), both performed by Pasha Hristova. In 1971, her performance of \\"–¢–æ–∑–∏ –¥–∏–≤–µ–Ω —Å–≤—è—Ç\\" (A Bulgarian adaptation of \\"Dziwny jest ten ≈õwiat\\") won first prize at the Sopot International Song Festival in Poland. Finally, her song \\"–ë—è–ª–∞ –ø–µ—Å–µ–Ω\\" (\\"White Song\\") won the Bulgarian \\"Melody of the year\\" television contest in 1972, shortly after her death. Death In 1971, she was due for a flight to Algeria where she would have toured with the Sofia Orchestra and other colleagues, including well-known stage singers Mariya Neykova, Boris Gudjunov and folk music singer Yanka Rupkina. As the plane was taking off, it rapidly lost altitude, hit the ground headfirst, broke in half and its front exploded and went up in flames. Pasha and Nikolay Arabadzhiev were in the front seats and died almost immediately (all in all 30 people were killed, including the entire crew). When Pasha died, she was carrying her second child, from Arabadzhiev. After being identified, Pasha was buried at Central Sofia Cemetery, in the catholic parcel. Little if any documentation of the details behind the cause of the crash has been released. The investigation into the matter was quickly placed under wraps. What is certain is that the plane in question had just come out of an extensive overhaul that took months to finish. An irresponsible technical error was made during the overhaul: the cables for the ailerons were incorrectly connected (left cable to right aileron and vice versa). Thus, when the pilots tried to straighten the plane, they ended up tilting it further, resulting in a crash at an extremely low altitude during take-off. According to an official report (made public only in 2001, and thanks to the efforts of a journalist from the Bulgarian newspaper \\"24 hours\\"), lack of expertise was said to be the culprit - the procedure was carried out by technicians lacking practical experience and using two separate design plans. According to Ani Nemova, there were attacks on her father Todor Yanakiev, the co-pilot originally assigned to that flight. She states that there were a total of three IL-18 planes that were sabotaged as a scare tactic to prevent Yanakiev from speaking to Todor Zhivkov about smuggling operations on freighters to Russia - one in Z√ºrich, one in Beli Iskar, and one in Sofia. On all three occasions Todor Yanakiev was taken off the plane at the last minute. He was warned, however, that the next time that would happen, he would not be saved.–ê–Ω–∏ –ù–µ–º–æ–≤–∞: –£–±–∏—Ö–∞ –ü–∞—à–∞ –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∞ –∑–∞—Ä–∞–¥–∏ –±–∞—â–∞ –º–∏! Actor Vasil Draganov believes that there was a hit out on his grandfather of the same name, who was the actual co-pilot on the fateful flight. The older Draganov is said to have had inside information on weapons being smuggled to third-world countries. Singer Boris Gudzhunov, a colleague of Pasha, has also said in subsequent interviews that according to his knowledge, the co-pilot was a target.–°–∞–º–æ–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –∫–∞—Ç–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–∞, 21 –¥–µ–∫–µ–º–≤—Ä–∏ 1971 –≥. –ê—Ç–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ç? Another colleague and perhaps best friend of Pasha, singer-songwriter Mariya Neikova, barely made it out alive. In panic, she quickly made a dash for safety, tearing one of her calves badly (which had gotten pierced by a metal rod in the crash), fled and jumped from a great height (around 10 meters). She survived but was severely injured. She had fractured her ribs and some of her vertebrae, and had over 40 stitches done on her legs. It was her birthday. For many years after the disaster, she did not celebrate her birthday, feeling guilt for having survived only because of switching seats with Pasha. In addition to this, Maria's husband was also among the ones who died in the crash. Musical style and voice Pasha Hristova had a very versatile voice and worked in different genres. Some of her songs can be described as ballads or chansons, many others are jazz and contemporary rock and roll, and she has even recorded some Bulgarian folk songs. As was common among Bulgarian singers at the time, a large part of her repertoire consisted of translations or broad adaptations of foreign originals. Her singing voice had a full and rich quality to the timbre. She was capable of alternating between the powerful and dramatic (\\"a voice that sweeps everything away\\") and the gentle and lyrical. One of her colleagues, singer Mimi Ivanova, has commented that despite being a shy and delicate person in everyday life, Pasha was \\"a volcano on stage\\".

The community is at the junction of Texas Farm To Market Roads 2909, 858, and 1653, roughly 30 miles west of Tyler, Texas and 80 miles east of Dallas, Texas. Though unincorporated, the community is one the fastest growing rural areas in East Texas. History The community derives its name from Daniel G. Martin, who owned a gristmill that was built just before the start of the American Civil War. Martin was revered for his generosity and character, and the citizens named the town after his mill. The land is well known for its rich and grassy pasture spaces that are ideal for cattle grazing which continues to this day. Martin's Mill formed a school district in the 1964 school year that was fully integrated due to a sizable Black population in the community. The school closed in the 1970s and students attended school in nearby Canton, but the school district was re-opened in 1981. Present day Martin's Mill continues to grow with many new residents building new homes and purchasing properties, but still has a very small community feel. The town has a Corner Store/Exxon Gas station, a fire station that houses South Central Van Zandt's Volunteer fire department, a Centurylink station, many churches of numerous denominations. The Community also has Mustang Park, which is owned and operated by Martin's Mill Independent School District, but is used heavily by the community. The park has a track for walking and running and a playing field, as well as tennis courts, and also Baseball and Softball fields that are used for Martin's Mill High School teams. Education The Martin's Mill Independent School District serves area students. MMISD is an award-winning school district that is noted for its academic excellence as well as its status as a perennial Texas high school basketball power for both Men's and Women's programs. Martin's Mill High School does not field a Football program. All of the schools are housed in the same immediate area.

He is best known for being chosen first in the 1984 Major League Baseball Draft, although he would go on to have a marginal career. Abner attended high school at Mechanicsburg Area High School in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, where he was identified by New York Mets scouts as an all-around \\"can't miss\\" outfield prospect after his sophomore year. He was also a star at football, and his number \\"16\\" was retired by the school for use in both sports. The Mets made him the first pick in the 1984 amateur draft, having had recent draft successes with Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden, two players who became stars almost immediately despite their young age. Abner never played a big league game for the Mets. After moving slowly through the minor league system, he was traded after the 1986 season to the San Diego Padres as part of an eight-player swap that sent Kevin Mitchell west in exchange for Kevin McReynolds. He would make his debut on September 8, 1987 in a loss to the Braves. Abner entered in the top of the eighth inning as a pinch hitter for Lance McCullers and flied out to center field in his first major league at bat. The light-hitting Abner played sparingly over the next five seasons for San Diego, used mostly as a reserve outfielder. He was traded to the California Angels in and signed by the Chicago White Sox in 1992. His season with the White Sox was probably his best, as he attained a .279 batting average over 97 games. However, Abner injured his knee the following season playing basketball before a Triple-A game for the Omaha Royals, and never played in the majors again.

He was a pupil of Henry Holiday and became one of the two chief designers for the well-known Lancaster firm of Shrigley and Hunt. He was in large measure responsible for establishing their late Pre-Raphaelite or Aesthetic style. Though largely neglected by 20th-century art historians he has more recently been acclaimed as a genius, and as one of the leading late-Victorian stained-glass designers.  Career  Carl Almquist was born in 1848 in Almby, near √ñrebro, Sweden. Wanting to study stained-glass production and not being able to do so in Sweden, he travelled to England at the age of 22 under the sponsorship of , a local architecture teacher. He became a pupil, and soon an employee, of the Pre-Raphaelite artist Henry Holiday, one of the leading stained-glass designers of the day, while also finding work with various other studios, including Burlison and Grylls, Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and James Powell and Sons. In December 1873 he began to get work from the new Lancaster firm of Shrigley and Hunt, both as a stained-glass designer and a decorative artist in other media, and in 1876 he became a permanent employee and moved to Lancaster. Here the firm's founder, Arthur William Hunt, and his two chief designers, Almquist and Edward Holmes Jewitt, worked as a close team, drawing particularly on the Aesthetic techniques Almquist had derived from Holiday and from Harry Ellis Wooldridge of the James Powell studio; they developed a house style of subtle colours (becoming richer in later years) and delicate drawing which defined Shrigley and Hunt until well into the 20th century. Almquist soon found he much preferred life in London, so to keep the company together Hunt opened a London branch for him in 1878. Almquist was still not finished with education, and from 1878 to 1884 attended the West London School of Art. This culminated with his being awarded a travelling scholarship to spend two months in Italy studying decorative art.The Builder. 46: 176. 1884. Retrieved 7 July 2020. As the years passed his style developed, with the Pre-Raphaelite influence becoming less obvious and those of Botticelli, D√ºrer and contemporary Scottish glass designers more so. Almquist designed many windows for locations in Scotland, Wales, the Home Counties, Yorkshire, and above all in the north-west of England, and there are scattered examples elsewhere. Though he never returned to Sweden he designed several of the stained glass windows for the St Nicholas Church, √ñrebro, then being restored by his old friend Adolf Kjellstr√∂m, and later for the Olaus Petri Church in the same town. Stylistic evidence also suggests that while employed by Shrigley and Hunt Almquist did some freelance work for the firm of Burlison and Grylls. In 1920, suffering from failing eyesight, he retired to the seaside resort of Hove, Sussex. He continued to send designs to Shrigley and Hunt and was paid for them, but they were never used. He died at Hove in 1924.

The TED spread is the difference between the interest rates on interbank loans and on short-term U.S. government debt (\\"T-bills\\"). TED is an acronym formed from T-Bill and ED, the ticker symbol for the Eurodollar futures contract. Initially, the TED spread was the difference between the interest rates for three-month U.S. Treasuries contracts and the three-month Eurodollars contract as represented by the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). However, since the Chicago Mercantile Exchange dropped T-bill futures after the 1987 crash,http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/LK25Dj01.html the TED spread is now calculated as the difference between the three-month LIBOR and the three-month T-bill interest rate. Formula and reading :\\\\mbox{TED spread} = {\\\\mbox{3-month LIBOR rate} - \\\\mbox{3-month T-bill interest rate}} The size of the spread is usually denominated in basis points (bps). For example, if the T-bill rate is 5.10% and ED trades at 5.50%, the TED spread is 40 . The TED spread fluctuates over time but generally has remained within the range of 10 and 50 (0.1% and 0.5%) except in times of financial crisis. A rising TED spread often presages a downturn in the U.S. stock market, as it indicates that liquidity is being withdrawn. Indicator The TED spread is an indicator of perceived credit risk in the general economy,Bloomberg.com Financial Glossary since T-bills are considered risk-free while LIBOR reflects the credit risk of lending to commercial banks. An increase in the TED spread is a sign that lenders believe the risk of default on interbank loans (also known as counterparty risk) is increasing. Interbank lenders, therefore, demand a higher rate of interest, or accept lower returns on safe investments such as T-bills. When the risk of bank defaults is considered to be decreasing, the TED spread decreases.Mission not accomplished not yet, anyway - Paul Krugman - Op-Ed Columnist - New York Times Blog Boudt, Paulus, and Rosenthal show that a TED spread above 48 basis points is indicative of economic crisis. Historical levels =Highs= The long-term average of the TED spread has been 30 basis points with a maximum of 50 . During 2007, the subprime mortgage crisis ballooned the TED spread to a region of 150‚Äì200 . On September 17, 2008, the TED spread exceeded 300 , breaking the previous record set after the Black Monday crash of 1987.Financial Times. (2008).

It was the oldest and largest cemetery in Paris and had often been used for mass graves. It was closed because of overuse in 1780, and in 1786 the remaining corpses were exhumed and transported to the unused subterranean quarries near Montparnasse known as the Catacombs. The place Joachim-du-Bellay in the Les Halles district now covers the site of the cemetery. The cemetery took its name (referring to the Biblical Massacre of the Innocents) from the attached church of the Holy Innocents that was demolished at the same time as the cemetery was cleared. https://vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=90224 History Sources describe the burial ground, then called Champeaux, and the associated church in the 12th century. It was located next to the central market (the original location of Les Halles). Under the reign of Philip II (1180-1223) the cemetery was enlarged and surrounded by a three-meter-high wall. Les Innocents had begun as a cemetery with individual sepulchres, but by then had become a site for mass graves. People were buried together in the same pit (a pit could hold about 1,500 dead at a time); only when it was full would another be opened. Charnier with mural of the Danse Macabre In the 14th and 15th centuries, citizens constructed arched structures called charniers or charnel houses along the cemetery walls to relieve the overcrowding of the mass graves; bones from the graves were excavated and then deposited here. Between August 1424 and Lent 1425, during the Anglo-Burgundian alliance when John Duke of Bedford ruled Paris as Regent after the deaths of Henry V of England and Charles VI of France, a mural of the Danse Macabre was painted on the back wall of the arcade below the charnel house on the south side of the cemetery. It was one of the earliest and best-known depictions of this theme. It was destroyed in 1669 when this wall was demolished to allow the narrow road behind it to be widened. The Fontaine des Innocents at its original location in the 17th century (19th-century engraving) The fountain as it appeared in 1791 when the French constitution was proclaimed on the March√© des Innocents In the 16th century, the prominent Renaissance anatomist Andreas Vesalius studied the bones of corpses in the Holy Innocents cemetery. During the reign of Louis XV, inspectors recorded accounts of the difficulties in conducting business in the area due to the unsanitary conditions of the cemetery, caused by overuse and incomplete decomposition of bodies. Two edicts by Louis XVI to move the parish cemeteries out of the city were resisted by the church, which was operating from burial fees. To reduce the number of burials, the price of burials was increased. After a prolonged period of rain in spring 1780, conditions became untenable. On 4 September 1780, an edict forbade burying corpses in Les Innocents and in all other Paris cemeteries. Bodies were exhumed and the bones were moved to the Catacombs in 1786. Many bodies had incompletely decomposed and had reduced into large deposits of fat (\\"corpse wax\\", or adipocere), chiefly in the form of palmitic acid. During the exhumation, this fat was collected and subsequently turned into candles and soap. The market in the area of the Holy Innocents cemetery in 1850 The Fontaine des Innocents today (detail) The church was destroyed in 1787 and the cemetery was replaced by a herb and vegetable market. The Fountain of the Nymphs, which had been erected in 1549 next to the church, was dismantled and rebuilt in the center of the new market. Now known as the \\"Fountain of Innocents\\", it still stands on Joachim-du-Bellay Square. At its closure, it was estimated that from the Middle Ages until the eighteenth century the Holy Innocents' Cemetery had been the repository of corpses from 22 parishes in Paris, including the remains of those who died at the H√¥tel-Dieu, plague victims, and various unknowns who drowned in the Seine, died on the roads, or were crippled at the nearby crossroads of the \\"Court of miracles\\", for a total of about two million Parisians. There are no signs of the charnel house today as the present location contains buildings, arcades, and shops. In modern fiction The destruction of the church and removal of the cemetery at Les Innocents is the subject of Andrew Miller's Costa prize winning 2011 novel Pure. In Anne Rice's The Vampire Lestat, Armand's coven of vampires resides in the Cimeti√®re des Innocents when Lestat first encounters them, and they remain there until shortly before the cemetery is finally destroyed. The cemetery and the Catacombs to which the remains were relocated play an important part in Barbary Hambly's novel Those Who Hunt The Night. In Patrick S√ºskind's novel Perfume, the main character Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born here in 17 July 1738.

Ensembles that include brass and woodwind instruments can in certain traditions also be termed brass bands (particularly in the context of New Orleans‚Äìstyle brass bands), but may more correctly termed military bands, concert bands, or \\"brass and reed\\" bands. Styles =Balkan= Balkan-style Brass Bands (, trumpet) play a distinctive style of music originating in 19th century Balkans when Roma trumpeters influenced by Turkish marching bands transposed folk music into brass. It is popular throughout the Balkans, especially Serbia, Albania, North Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria and Northern Greece. The beats are usually fast and accompanied by kolo. The performers each have their instrument of the orchestra and are called trubaƒçi (—Ç—Ä—É–±–∞—á–∏). The best known examples of acclaimed music in this style are from Goran Bregoviƒá and Boban Markoviƒá Orkestar. The Serbian film maker Emir Kusturica has, through his films (Black Cat, White Cat), made the style popular in the international community outside the Balkans. =British-style= A brass band in the British tradition with a full complement of 28 players (including percussion) consists of: *1 Soprano cornet in E *9 Cornets in B (in separate parts for 'solo', 'repiano', 2nd and 3rd cornets; there are 4 players on the 'solo' part, one repiano, two 2nd, and two 3rd) *1 Flugel horn in B (notated on the same part as the 'repiano' in some older music) *3 Tenor horns in E (called solo, 1st and 2nd) *2 Baritone horns in B (each with separate parts) *2 Tenor trombones (notated in B, playing separate parts) *1 Bass trombone (the only brass instrument in the band notated in Concert Pitch (C) on bass clef) *2 Euphoniums in B (usually playing the same part with divisi sections) *4 Tubas (2 in E and 2 in B, both notated in treble clef; often called Basses) *2 or 3 percussion players (with 2 or more timpani, glockenspiel, snare drum, triangle, cymbals, a drum kit and more) File:sopranocornet.jpgSoprano cornet File:Cornet-Bb-large.jpgCornet File:Flugel-lhside-large.jpgFlugelhorn File:Kate Westbrook.jpg  Tenor Horn File:BaritoneHorn.jpg Baritone horn File:Posaune.jpgTenor trombone File:Bass trombone.jpgBass trombone File:euphonium1.JPGEuphonium File:Bastubor.jpgE and B Tubas With the exception of the trombones, all of the brass are conical-bore instruments, which gives the British-style brass band its distinctive bright, mellow sound (as opposed to a dark symphonic sound). All parts apart from the bass trombone and percussion are now written in treble clef. Note that despite its musical range, the alto horn in E is traditionally called the tenor horn in British bands. Brass bands have a long tradition of competition between bands, often based around local industry and communities. In the 1930s brass bands thrived most with around 20,000 brass bands in the U.K. British-style brass bands are widespread throughout Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and continental Europe and are also found in North America. Annual competitions are held in these countries to select champion bands at various levels of musical competence. The Salvation Army, part of the Christian church, has deployed brass bands since 1878 and they continue to be an integral part of that organisation. The most well-known Salvation Army brass band is The International Staff Band which is based in London. Salvation Army bands vary considerably in size and complement as they are based on the local personnel available, some being as small as 6-8 members. The cornet section of a Salvation Army band does not include a 'repiano' and instead of 2nd & 3rd cornets there are 1st & 2nd cornets. A Salvation Army band may have 3-6 tenor horns, 2-4 baritones and 2-6 tenor trombones. Salvation Army bands have a local tradition of training children in brass playing from an early age (starting at 7‚Äì8 years old). In larger Salvation Army churches there will often be a junior band for children (7‚Äì18 years old) as well as a senior band for adults. =Low Countries= Fanfare orchestras are a type of brass band mainly found in Belgium and the Netherlands, while several ensembles exist in Germany, France and Luxembourg. Unlike British bands, they also sport saxophones. There are fanfares affiliated to the military and civil fanfare orchestras which are an important element of cultural tradition in some areas. In the second part of the 20th century, many British-style brass bands have been founded in the Low Countries as well, often as part of a musical association also including a fanfare orchestra or a concert band. =New Orleans= The Spirit of New Orleans Brass Band performs at the French Quarter Festival, New Orleans, Louisiana, 11 April 2008. The tradition of brass bands in New Orleans, Louisiana dates to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Traditionally, New Orleans brass bands could feature various instrumentations, often including trumpets, trombones, clarinets, saxophones, sousaphones, and percussion. The music played by these groups was often a fusion between European-styled military band music and African folk music brought to the Americas by West African slaves and the idiom played a significant role in the development of traditional jazz. Early brass bands include the Eureka Brass Band, the Onward Brass Band, the Excelsior Brass Band, the Tuxedo Brass Band, the Young Tuxedo Brass Band, the Camelia Brass Band, and the Olympia Brass Band. The Treme Brass Band, while not as old, has members who have been influential throughout New Orleans Brass Band music, as well as being renowned in its own right. A well-known use of these bands is for the New Orleans jazz funeral and second line parades. Hip-Hop and Funk In the 1970s and 1980s, the New Orleans brass band tradition experienced a renaissance, with bands breaking away from traditional stylings and adding elements of funk, hip hop, and bop to their repertoires. Some notable exponents of this style of brass band include the band Def Generation, members of the next generation of Nevilles who created hip hop over live brass bands influencing, Soul Rebels Brass Band, Rebirth Brass Band, the Stooges Brass Band, the Hot 8 Brass Band, the Lil Rascals Brass Band, Youngblood Brass Band, The Original Pinettes Brass Band, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and The Big 6 Brass Band. Also, a number of groups outside the United States have begun playing this style of music. The style of the music is often characterized by the use of the sousaphone in place of a Double bass to play the bass-line. The sousaphone may play a traditional jazz walking bassline or groove on a riff. Trumpets, trombones, saxophones, and other horns play melodies and harmonies loosely over the bass- line. Often the lines are greatly embellished with improvisation. A typical setup includes two percussionists, one playing a marching bass drum and a cymbal mounted on the drum and another playing a snare drum (the snare drummer often switches to a drum kit when not marching). Many variations on this exist, including the use of additional percussionists, cymbals, drums, whistles and Scratch DJ's. The style has moved beyond New Orleans and can now be found in such places as Japan with the Black Bottom Brass Band; Finland with TIMO Brass Band; Belgium with Brazzmatazz, the Netherlands with the Neutral Ground Brass Band, Happy Feet and the Hurricane brass bands; Scotland with the Criterion Brass Band; England with the Renegade Brass Band; Australia with the Horns of Leroy Brass Band; Phoenix, Arizona with the Bad Cactus Brass Band; Boston, Massachusetts with the Hot Tamale Brass Band; Hartford, CT with the Funky Dawgz Brass Band; Tennessee with Halfbrass; Minnesota with the Jack Brass Band and the Dirty Shorts Brass Band; Missouri with the Funky Butt Brass Band; Georgia with the Half Dozen Brass Band; Cincinnati, Ohio with The Cincy Brass; Madison, Wisconsin with the Mama Digdown's and Youngblood; Richmond, VA No BS! Brass brass bands; and Sacramento, California with Element Brass Band. =Polynesia= Founded in 1836 by King Kamehameha III, the Royal Hawaiian Band is the second oldest and only full-time municipal band in the United States. In recent generations, unique brass band traditions have also developed in Tonga, Samoa, and other parts of Polynesia, as well as among the MƒÅori of New Zealand. Some recordings are now available and these styles are beginning to be researched and promoted abroad through band tours. =Zanzibar= Deriving from English 'band', Beni is a popular wedding entertainment with a strong focus on rhythm and dance, and audience participation. Beni originated in Zanzibar around the turn of the 20th century as a mockery of colonial style military bands. In Zanzibar, Beni is performed both as a street parade and stationary as a wedding dance. Festivals and contests One festival featuring brass bands is the Tarragona International Dixieland Festival, in Catalonia, Spain. The organisation programs not only dixieland brass bands but also ethnic or world music brass bands from over the world, including the Dirty Dozen Brass Band from the US, Boban Markoviƒá Orkestar from Serbia, the Jaipur Kawa Brass Band from India and Taraf Goulamas from Occitania France. In the United States the Great American Brass Band Festival has been held annually in Danville, Kentucky for the past 30 years and is free for all. This event attracts brass band lovers from the U.S., Canada, and Europe. The Vintage Band Festival occurs in Northfield, Minnesota every three years. The North American Brass Band Association sponsors an annual convention that provides member bands with the opportunity to compete in a contest format similar to those conducted in the United Kingdom and Europe. The contest is typically late March to early April every year. In Boston, Seattle and Austin a series of festivals called HONK! bring together street brass bands (and other related ensembles) from the United States and Canada, and some bands from other parts of the world. The groups presented include Balkan Brass Bands, New Orleans brass bands, Political Action Bands, Klezmer, and \\"DIY\\" Alternative / Radical Community Bands.

Early years (1853‚Äì93) √âtienne Jean Marie Flandin was born on 1 April 1853 in Paris. The Flandin family originated in Domecy-sur-Cure. His parent were Charles Flandin (1803-1887), doctor of medicine, and Aline de Sonis (1823-1857). Charles Flandin supported the Republican opposition during the Second French Empire and became vice- president of the General Council of Yonne. Etienne Flandin attended the Lyc√©e Saint-Louis for his secondary education. He studied law in Paris, where he earned a doctorate. In 1876 Flandin married Pauline Ribi√®re. He became a professor of civil law at the Faculty of Algiers. He lectured at the Faculty of Algiers from 1880 to 1882. He was Advocate-General at Pau from 1882 to 1887. He was a substitute in Paris from 1887 to 1889, then Attorney General in Algiers from 1889 to 1893. He became a member of the General Council of Yonne. Deputy (1893‚Äì1909) Flandin was elected on 3 September 1893 as Republican candidate for the Avallon constitutuency of Yonne. He won 5,700 votes in the second round of voting against 4,496 for the Radical candidate, Albert Gallot(fr). He sat with the Republican Union parliamentary group. He ran for reelection in 1898 but was defeated by Gallot. He left office on 31 May 1898. In 1902 Flandin won election as deputy of Yonne by 5,768 votes against 5,070 for Gallot. He again sat with the Republican Union group, and was president of this group during the 8th legislature (1902‚Äì06). He submitted several legislative proposals concerning the judiciary, taxation and proportional representation in elections. In 1904 he was chairman of a committee to investigate suppression of congregational education. In 1905 he participated in the debate on the law of separation of church and state, which he supported. Flandin was reelected on 6 May 1906. He won 5,802 votes against 4,000 for the Radical Socialist Paul Degouy(fr). On 20 January 1908 Flandin proposed a revision of \\"the penal laws concerning vagrancy and begging, the organization of assistance through work and the supervision of nomads exercising itinerant professions.\\" He proposed that non-nationals should be required to carry a booklet that would be used to record and control their movement. Senator (1909‚Äì22) On 3 January 1909 Flandin was elected senator for French India by 85 votes against 20 for the incumbent Jules Godin. He was admitted to the senate on 30 March 1909 and resigned from the chamber of deputies on 2 April 1909. He was a member of the Republican Union group. He was a member of many special committees, and was often their president or rapporteur. These included committees on the colonial customs regime, economic blockade of Germany, and offenses against the external security of France. He gave numerous speeches on subjects such as extradition between France and Britain, voting secrecy and wards of the nation. In the legislative elections of 1914 Flandin gave his support to Paul Bluysen as deputy for French India. Bluysen won by a large majority. At the start of World War I (1914‚Äì18) the penalty for desertion in face of the enemy was death. Flandin pointed out that the high rates of acquittal in 1914 and 1915 were probably due to reluctance of judges to apply such a severe sentence. After the law of 27 April 1916 gave the judges more flexibility in punishment, the number of convictions for desertion rose. On 29 March 1918, during a difficult phase of the war, the Senate decided to review a proposed change to the code of military justice of 3 October 1916. As rapporteur, Flandin stated that this was not the time to reopen the question, and that the need for discipline must be addressed as well as the demand for justice that had been formulated by the Chamber a few months earlier. The senators followed Flandin in agreeing on the principle of a secret ballot and the freedom of the accused to communication with his defense council, but refused to increase the number of judges on the tribunals from five to seven. Flandin was president of the Muslim section of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs. He was secretary of the Committee for French Affairs in Syria in 1916. During the war one of the issues was that Muslim soldiers and \\"unbelievers\\" were interred together in mass graves. As president of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Flandin warned Aristide Briand in September 1916 that, \\"Our enemies could not find a subject more likely to overexcite Muslim fanaticism. In 1917 Flandin criticized conscription of Algerian troops, since it thought it wrong to force the indigenous people to accept French practices and ideals. He thought it would be better to use a militia system based on local tribal organization, so the indig√®ne could \\"evolve not in our civilization, but in his own.\\" On 26 October 1918 Flandin was appointed temporary Resident General in Tunis. He was given this post by Georges Clemenceau before the armistice had been signed. As the official representative of the French government in Tunisia, he directed the protectorate's administration. He followed the policy of his predecessor, Gabriel Alapetite, in reorganization of indigenous justice and development of the railways. He also created the Public Health and Hygiene administration to fight tuberculosis, typhus and syphilis. He implemented a Water Code for new irrigation projects, which would lead to more intense agricultural production. He was relieved of his functions in Tunisia on 1 January 1921, and returned to France to resume his activity as senator. Due to the war Flandin's term as senator was extended to 18 January 1920. On that date he was reelected to the senate by 100 votes against 4 for his opponent Martineau. Flandin died on 20 September 1922 in Paris. He was a Knight of the Legion of Honour and an Officer of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise.

The case involved consideration of arbitrary detention under section 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and rights to an explanation for detention and rights to counsel under section 10. The Supreme Court ultimately overturned Latimer's conviction due to the Crown's improper actions at the jury selection stage. As a result, the decision was the first given by the Supreme Court in the Latimer case, the second being R v Latimer[2001] 1 SCR 3. on cruel and unusual punishment under section 12 of the Charter. Background Latimer, who had poisoned his 12-year-old quadriplegic daughter with carbon monoxide in 1993, became the target of the police's suspicion after Tracy's autopsy. The police then visited Latimer's farm and detained him. The police had said they wanted to talk with Mr. Latimer, and he got into the car with them. An officer then told Latimer he was in a serious situation, he was being detained due to Tracy's death, and that Latimer had a right to counsel and legal aid. Latimer replied that he understood but declined to contact a lawyer immediately. He also wanted to put on different clothes, and the police let him, but they told him they would walk with him into the house as he was now in their custody. During the questioning, the police told Latimer once again that he had rights to counsel and a right to silence, and he declined to ask for a lawyer. After an officer said he was convinced Latimer had killed his daughter, Latimer confessed. He was then charged with murder, after writing a confession that he was told could lead to a murder charge. When the jury was being selected, the Crown counsel and Royal Canadian Mounted Police intervened to query candidates for the jury on their positions regarding controversial matters such as abortion and euthanasia (matters related to Tracy's death, which Latimer claimed was a mercy killing). Some of candidates who were queried ultimately ended up on the jury. Latimer was found guilty, and the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal upheld the trial decision. It was only after the Court of Appeal's decision that the Crown's actions during jury selection came to light. Decision The decision was written by Chief Justice Antonio Lamer, who emphasized at the outset that his decision would not deal with the ethical controversies surrounding what Latimer claimed to have been a mercy killing. Latimer also claimed his detention was arbitrary and therefore breached section 9 of the Charter. The Court decided the detention was not arbitrary, as it was carried out because it seemed likely that Latimer was guilty. These were valid grounds for an arrest; the detention fit the definition of a proper arrest even though the police never called it one. The description of the incident as a detention, the police making it clear that he was in their custody by walking him into the house so he could put on different clothes, and Latimer's acceptance that the police were in control were enough for Latimer to understand he was being arrested. The Court then turned to whether the police's decision not to tell Mr. Latimer he was being arrested and could face a murder charge breached section 10(a) of the Charter. This section states one must be \\"informed promptly of the reasons\\" for detention or arrest. The Court found section 10(a) was not infringed. Section 10(a) is meant to ensure those arrested or detained are aware of the gravity of the situation. Latimer argued that since the police did not call the detention an arrest, he was not fully aware of how serious the trouble he was in was. He also claimed this was the reason why he had declined to talk to a lawyer. Again, the Court argued the words used did not matter, but rather how the suspect can interpret the situation. Latimer could be expected to understand the seriousness of the situation since he was told he was being detained in connection with Tracy's death. The police had explicitly said the situation was serious, and had told him of rights one has when being arrested. Finally, the case involved section 10(b), the right \\"to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right\\". The Court noted it had found in R v Bartle[1994] 3 SCR 173 [Battle]. that rights to be informed that one may seek counsel included rights to be told of duty counsel and how to obtain it; i.e., through a free telephone call. Although Latimer was told that legal aid existed, he was not told that he could make a free telephone call and obtain advice from duty counsel right away. Latimer argued this contradicted Bartle. However, Saskatchewan happened to have different hours during which one could make a free telephone call to directly obtain duty counsel. The arrest occurred at a time when it was not available; therefore the right established in Bartle was inapplicable in this case, as it would have been of no use. Still, the Supreme Court ordered a new trial. As the Court wrote, the Crown counsel's actions during jury selection \\"were nothing short of a flagrant abuse of process and interference with the administration of justice\\". The justice system demanded justice and transparency, and the trial was lacking in this regard.

Gameplay Cry Havoc is a wargame with a medieval setting. Several scenarios are included in the game that set up a variety of combatants on each side, including peasants, sergeants, billmen, men-at-arms, knights and various other \\"character\\" classes. For example, in the scenario called \\"Peasant Revolt\\", 11 peasants, 19 yeoman and six pack mules are arrayed against 13 mounted and heavily armoured knights.

His only minor caveat was that the counters were too thin to be easily picked up. Rolston highly recommended it, saying, \\"Cry Havoc is easy to learn and simple to play... The rules are clear and unambiguous, and the scenarios are varied and dramatic...

ARVN commandos were transported by U.S. helicopters behind entrenched Viet Cong (VC) positions, attacking them with shoulder fired rockets and flame throwers. Sniper teams then tracked the fleeing rebels and engaged them. Background On 26 April ARVN and U.S. Army and Marine Corps officers met in Pleiku to plan a helicopter assault on the VC Do Xa stronghold () on the northern border of II Corps. The operational plan called for HMM-364 to lift an ARVN battalion from Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Airfield to Landing Zone Bravo to the west, simultaneously a U.S. Army helicopter company based at Pleiku would transport 2 ARVN battalions from Gi Lang to a second landing zone southwest of LZ Bravo. Operation On the morning of 27 April Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) A-1 Skyraiders conducted preparatory airstrikes on the 2 landing zones following which U.S. Army UH-1B helicopter gunships conducted a reconnaissance of the landing zones and were met by VC machine gun fire at LZ Bravo. The UH-1Bs engaged the machine guns until they ran out of munitions and returned to base to refuel and rearm and further airstrikes were called in. One A-1 was hit by 0.51 cal machine gun fire and crashed from Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Airfield. The airstrikes continued until 12:25 when the transport helicopters began their landing but the VC remained active around LZ Bravo hitting many of the UH-34Ds, forcing one to crash-land in the LZ. The second wave was delayed to allow further airstrikes and only resumed at 13:55 but the VC continued to fire on the LZ and approaching helicopters hitting one RVNAF UH-34 and forcing it to crash-land. With more ARVN forces now on the ground they were able to push back to VC machine-gunners from LZ Bravo, however the VC had hit 15 of the 19 Marine helicopters and only 11 Marine and RVNAF helicopters remained airworthy at the end of the day. The following morning HMM-364 landed the last ARVN forces at LZ Bravo. On 28 April an HMM-364 UH-34 was caught in rotor wash while landing at Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Airfield and crashed into a canal being totally written off. On 29 April an aircraft recovery team flew to LZ Bravo to assess the two shot down UH-34s, however both were deemed beyond repair and were destroyed. Aftermath The one-month-long operation ended with heavy damage to the Viet Cong communications line that linked Do Xa with other Viet Cong controlled provinces, and forced a critical regrouping of the estimated nine hundred remaining Viet Cong fighters there.

Under the new plan, the Army would be organized around modular brigades of 3,000‚Äì4,000 soldiers each, with the aim of being able to deploy continuously in different parts of the world, and effectively organizing the Army closer to the way it fights. An additional 30,000 soldiers were recruited as a short-term measure to assist in the structural changes, although a permanent end-strength change was not expected because of fears of future funding cuts, forcing the Army to pay for the additional personnel from procurement and readiness accounts. Up to 60% of the defense budget is spent on personnel and an extra 10,000 soldiers would cost US$1.4 billion annually. On November 22 and 23, 2002, the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs held the \\"Belfer Center Conference on Military Transformation\\". It brought together present and former defense officials and military commanders for the stated purpose of assessing the Department of Defense's progress in achieving a \\"transformation\\" of U.S. military capabilities. The conference was held at the Belfer Center at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The United States Army War College and the Dwight D. Eisenhower National Security Series were co- sponsors. In some respects this could be said to have been the birthplace of Transformation as a formal paradigm. In 2004, the United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM), which commands most active Army and Army Reserve Component forces based in the Continental United States, was tasked with supervising the modular transformation of its subordinate structure. In March 2004, a contract was awarded to Anteon Corporation (now part of General Dynamics) to provide Modularity Coordination Cells (MCCs) to each transforming corps, division and brigade within FORSCOM. Each MCC contained a team of functional area specialists who provided direct, ground-level support to the unit. The MCCs were coordinated by the Anteon office in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2007 a new deployment scheme known as Grow the Army was adopted that enabled the Army to carry out continuous operations. The plan was modified several times including an expansion of troop numbers in 2007 and changes to the number of modular brigades. On 25 June 2013, plans were announced to disband 13 modular brigade combat teams (BCTs) and expand the remaining brigades with an extra maneuver battalion, extra fires batteries, and an engineer battalion. =History of ARFORGEN= The Secretary of the Army approved implementing ARFORGEN, a transformational force generation model, in 2006.

The initiative was designed to grow the army by almost 75,000 soldiers, while realigning a large portion of the force in Europe to the continental United States in compliance with the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure suggestions. This grew the force from 42 Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and 75 modular support brigades in 2007 to 45 Brigade Combat Teams and 83 modular support brigades by 2013. On 25 June 2013, US Army Chief of Staff General Raymond T. Odierno announced plans to disband 13 brigade combat teams and reduce troop strengths by 80,000 soldiers. While the number of BCTs will be reduced, the size of remaining BCTs will increase, on average, to about 4,500 soldiers. That will be accomplished, in many cases, by moving existing battalions and other assets from existing BCTs into other brigades. Two brigade combat teams in Germany had already been deactivated and a further 10 brigade combat teams slated for deactivation were announced by General Odierno on 25 June. (An additional brigade combat team was announced for deactivation 6 November 2014.) At the same time the maneuver battalions from the disbanded brigades will be used to augment armored and infantry brigade combat teams with a third maneuver battalion and expanded brigades fires capabilities by adding a third battery to the existing fires battalions. Furthermore, all brigade combat teams‚Äîarmored, infantry and Stryker‚Äîwill gain a Brigade Engineer Battalion, with \\"gap-crossing\\" and route-clearance capability. On 6 November 2014, it was reported that the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, currently stationed in South Korea, was to be deactivated in June 2015 and be replaced by a succession of U.S.-based brigade combat teams, which are to be rotated in and out, at the same nine-month tempo as practiced by the Army from 2001‚Äì2014. Eleven brigades were inactivated by 2015. The remaining brigades as of 2015 are listed below.

The fact that this modernization is now in place has been acknowledged by the renaming of the 'Brigade Modernization Command' to the \\"U.S. Army Joint Modernization Command,\\" on 16 February 2017.BMC redesignated JMC, New Name Better Reflects Evolving Organizational Mission accessdate=2017-02-16 =Modular combat brigades= Modular combat brigades are self-contained combined arms formations.Field Manual No. 3-96 (8 October 2015) Brigade Combat Team FM 3-96 They are standardized formations across the active and reserve components, meaning an Armored BCT at Fort Hood is the same as one at Fort Stewart.One consequence of a standardized BCT is that actions performed by one BCT can be made in behalf of a successor BCT. Thus pre-positioned stocks can aid in the rapidity of deployment: Army Prepositioned Stocks site in the Netherlands was established 15 Dec 2016, which will store and service about 1,600 U.S. Army vehicles. *U.S. military equipment to arrive in Germany, 6-9 Jan 2017 *Tank Brigade (3ABCT/4th ID) sets quick pace moving to Europe *Soldiers Journal: Rolling Into Europe (3ABCT/4th ID) Reconnaissance plays a large role in the new organizational designs. The Army felt the acquisition of the target was the weak link in the chain of finding, fixing, closing with, and destroying the enemy. The Army felt that it had already sufficient lethal platforms to take out the enemy and thus the number of reconnaissance units in each brigade was increased.The Army is introducing drones in its combat aviation brigades in order to increase its reconnaissance capability. *(May 3, 2015) Apache helicopter squadron is the first unit to incorporate Shadow drones The brigades sometimes depend on joint fires from the Air Force and Navy to accomplish their mission. As a result, the amount of field artillery has been reduced in the brigade design. The three types of BCTs are Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs), Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) (includes Light, Air Assault and Airborne units), and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs). Armored Brigade structure Armored Brigade Combat Teams, or ABCTs consist of 4,743 troops. This includes the third maneuver battalion as laid out in 2013. The changes announced by the U.S. army on 25 June 2013, include adding a third maneuver battalion to the brigade, a second engineer company to a new Brigade Engineer Battalion, a third battery to the FA battalion, and reducing the size of each battery from 8 to 6 guns. These changes will also increase the number of troops in the affected battalions and also increase the total troops in the brigade. Since the brigade has more organic units, the command structure includes a deputy commander (in addition to the traditional executive officer) and a larger staff capable of working with civil affairs, special operations, psychological operations, air defense, and aviation units. An Armored BCT consists of: * the brigade headquarters and headquarters company (HHC): 43 officers, 17 warrant officers, 125 enlisted personnel ‚Äì total: 185 soldiers. * the Brigade Engineer Battalion (BEB) (formerly Brigade Special Troops Battalion (BSTB)), consisted of a headquarters company, signal company, military intelligence company with a TUAV platoon and two combat engineer companies (A and B company). The former BSTB fielded 28 officers, 6 warrant officers, 470 enlisted personnel ‚Äì total: 504 soldiers. Each of the combat engineer company fields 13√ó M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV) Operation Desert Storm-Engineer (ODS-E), 1√ó M113A3 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), 3√ó M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV), 1√ó M9 Armored Combat Earthmover (ACE), and 2√ó M104 Heavy Assault Bridge (HAB). * a Cavalry (formerly Armed Reconnaissance) Squadron, consisting of a headquarters troop (HHT) and three reconnaissance troops and one armored troop. The HHT fields 2√ó M3A3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicles (CFVs) and 3√ó M7A3 Bradley Fire Support Vehicles, while each reconnaissance troop fields 7√ó M3A3 CFVs. The squadron fields 35 officers and 385 enlisted personnel ‚Äì total: 424 soldiers. * three identical combined arms battalions, flagged as a battalion of an infantry, armored or cavalry regiment. Each battalion consists of a headquarters and headquarters company, two tank companies and two mechanized infantry companies. The battalions field 48 officers and 580 enlisted personnel each ‚Äì total: 628 soldiers. The HHC fields 1√ó M1A2 main battle tank, 1√ó M2A3 infantry fighting vehicle, 3√ó M3A3 cavalry fighting vehicles, 4√ó M7A3 fire support vehicles and 4√ó M1064 mortar carriers with M120 120 mm mortars. Each of the two tank companies fields 14√ó M1A2 main battle tanks, while each mechanized infantry company fields 14√ó M2A3 infantry fighting vehicles. In 2016, the ABCT's combined arms battalions adopted a triangle structure, of two armored battalions (of two armored companies plus a single mechanized infantry company) plus a mechanized infantry battalion (of two mechanized companies and one armored company). This resulted in the reduction of two mechanized infantry companies; the deleted armored company was reflagged as a troop to the Cavalry Squadron. * a Field Artillery battalion, consisting of a headquarters battery, two cannon batteries with 8√ó M109A6 self-propelled 155 mm howitzers each (the changes announced by the U.S. Army on 25 June 2013, include adding a third battery to the FA battalion, and reducing the size of each battery from 8 to 6 guns; these changes also increase the number of troops in the affected battalions and also increase the total troops in the Brigade), and a target acquisition platoon. 24 officers, 2 warrant officers, 296 enlisted personnel ‚Äì total: 322 soldiers. * a brigade support battalion (BSB),Lt.

Infantry Brigade structure Infantry Brigade Combat Team, or IBCTs, comprised around 3,300 soldiers, in the pre-2013 design, which did not include the 3rd maneuver battalion. The 2013 end-strength is now 4,413 Soldiers: * Special Troops Battalion (now Brigade Engineer Battalion) * Cavalry Squadron * (2), later (3) Infantry Battalions * Field Artillery Battalion * Brigade Support Battalion Stryker Brigade structure Stryker Brigade Combat Team or SBCTs comprised about 3,900 soldiers, making it the largest of the three combat brigade constructs in the 2006 design, and over 4,500 Soldiers in the 2013 reform. Its design includes: * Headquarters Company * Cavalry Squadron (with three 14-vehicle, two-120 mm mortar reconnaissance troops plus a surveillance troop with UAVs and NBC detection capability) * (3) Stryker infantry battalions (each with three rifle companies with 12 infantry-carrying vehicles, 3 mobile gun platforms, 2 120 mm mortars, and around 100 infantry dismounts each, plus an HHC with scout, mortar and medical platoons and a sniper section.) * Engineer Company (folded into the Brigade Engineer Battalion) [An additional engineer company was added to the battalion in the 2013 reform] * Signal Company (folded into the Brigade Engineer Battalion) * Military Intelligence Company (with UAV platoon) (folded into the Brigade Engineer Battalion) * Anti-tank company (9 TOW-equipped Stryker vehicles) (folded into the Brigade Engineer Battalion) * Field Artillery Battalion (three 6-gun 155 mm Howitzer batteries, target acquisition platoon, and a joint fires cell) * Brigade Support Battalion (headquarters, medical, maintenance, and distribution companies) =Modular support brigades= Combat support brigades Heavy Combat Aviation Brigade Structure Full Spectrum Combat Aviation Brigade Structure Similar modularity will exist for support units which fall into five types: Aviation, Fires (artillery), Battlefield Surveillance (intelligence), Maneuver Enhancement (engineers, signal, military police, chemical, and rear-area support), and Sustainment (logistics, medical, transportation, maintenance, etc.). In the past, artillery, combat support, and logistics support only resided at the division level and brigades were assigned those units only on a temporary basis when brigades transformed into \\"brigade combat teams\\" for particular deployments. Combat Aviation Brigades are multi-functional, offering a combination of attack helicopters (i.e., Apache), reconnaissance helicopters (i.e., Kiowa), medium-lift helicopters (i.e., Blackhawks), heavy- lift helicopters (i.e., Chinooks), and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) capability. Aviation will not be organic to combat brigades. It will continue to reside at the division-level due to resource constraints. Heavy divisions (of which there are six) will have 48 Apaches, 38 Blackhawks, 12 Chinooks, and 12 Medevac helicopters in their aviation brigade. These are divided into two aviation attack battalions, an assault lift battalion, a general aviation support battalion. An aviation support battalion will have headquarters, refuelling/resupply, repair/maintenance, and communications companies.\\"Ft Hood's 615th ASB trains at McGregor Range\\", Fort Bliss Monitor 6/26/2013 Light divisions will have aviation brigades with 60 armed reconnaissance helicopters and no Apaches, with the remaining structure the same. The remaining divisions will have aviation brigades with 30 armed reconnaissance helicopters and 24 Apaches, with the remaining structure the same.

Fires Brigade Structure Field Artillery Brigades (formerly known as \\"Fires Brigades\\" prior to 2014) provide traditional artillery fire (Paladin Howitzer, M270 MLRS, HIMARS) as well as information operations and non-lethal effects capabilities. After the 2013 reform, the expertise formerly embodied in the pre-2007 Division Artillery (DIVARTY) was formally re- instituted in the Division Artillery Brigades of 2015.2008 White Paper requesting DIVARTY The operational Fires battalions will now report to this new formulation of DIVARTY, for training and operational Fires standards, as well as to the BCT.Spc.

The remaining AC divisional ADA battalion along with six ARNG divisional ADA battalions will be pooled at the Unit of Employment to provide on-call air and missile defense (AMD) protection. The pool of Army AMD resources will address operational requirements in a tailorable and timely manner without stripping assigned AMD capability from other missions.

Maneuver Enhancement Brigade Structure Security Force Assistance Brigades Security force assistance brigades (SFABs) are brigades whose mission is to train, advise, and assist (TAA) the armed forces of other states. The SFAB are neither bound by conventional decisive operations nor counter-insurgency operations. Operationally, a 500-soldier SFAB would free-up a 4500-soldier BCT from a TAA mission. On 23 June 2016 General Mark Milley revealed plans for train/advise/assist Brigades, consisting of seasoned officers and NCOs with a full chain of command,Priorities for Our Nation's Army with General Mark A. Milley (23 Jun 2016) but no junior Soldiers. In the event of a national emergency the end-strengths of the SFABs could be augmented with new soldiers from basic training and advanced individual training. An SFAB was projected to consist of 500 senior officers and NCOs, which, the Army says, could act as a cadre to reform a full BCT in a matter of months. In May 2017, the initial SFAB staffing of 529 soldiers was underway, including 360 officers. The officers will have had previous command experience. Commanders and leaders will have previously led BCTs at the same echelon.(16 October 2017) First security force assistance brigade training for deployment The remaining personnel, all senior NCOs, are to be recruited from across the Army.Lolita C.

Army Field Support Brigades Army Field Support Brigades (AFSBs) have been utilized to field materiel in multiple Combatant Command's Areas of Responsibility (AORs). Initially 405th AFSB prepositioned stocks for a partial brigade; eventually, the 405th was to field materiel for an ABCT, a Division headquarters, a Fires Brigade, and a Sustainment Brigade in their AOR, which required multinational agreements. Similarly, 401st AFSB configured materiel for an ABCT in their AOR as well. The objective has been combat configuration: maintain their vehicles to support a 96-hour readiness window for a deployed ABCT on demand. In addition, 403rd Army Field Support Brigade maintains prepositioned stocks for their AOR. =Command headquarters= Below the Combatant Commands echelon, Division commands will command and control their combat and support brigades.Headquarters, Dept of the Army (July 2019) ADP 6-0 Mission Command: Command and Control of Army Forces 4 chapters. See also ADP 3-0; ADP 6-22; FM 6-22; ADP 1-1; and ADP 5-0 Divisions will operate as plug-and-play headquarters commands (similar to corps) instead of fixed formations with permanently assigned units. Any combination of brigades may be allocated to a division command for a particular mission, up to a maximum of four combat brigades. For instance, the 3rd Infantry Division headquarters could be assigned two armor brigades and two infantry brigades based on the expected requirements of a given mission. On its next deployment, the same division may have one Stryker brigade and two armor brigades assigned to it. The same modus operandi holds true for support units. The goal of reorganization with regard to logistics is to streamline the logistics command structure David B.

Belzer (January 2, 2019) Command relationships between corps and ESCs ESC = (Expeditionary Support Command); TSC = (Theater Support Command) The division headquarters itself has also been redesigned as a modular unit that can be assigned an array of units and serve in many different operational environments.See, for example Francis J.H. Park (November/December 2007) \\"The strategic plans and policy officer in the modular division\\" The new term for this headquarters is the UEx (or Unit of Employment, X). The headquarters is designed to be able to operate as part of a joint force, command joint forces with augmentation, and command at the operational level of warfare (not just the tactical level). It will include organic security personnel and signal capability plus liaison elements. As of March 2015, nine of the ten regular Army division headquarters, and two national guard division headquarters are committed in support of Combatant Commands. The 29th Division (National Guard) headquarters is deployed as Intermediate Command for ARCENT in KuwaitTwo National Guard division headquarters are deployed simultaneously for the first time since the Korean war When not deployed, the division will have responsibility for the training and readiness of a certain number of modular brigades units. For instance, the 3rd Infantry Division headquarters module based at Fort Stewart, GA is responsible for the readiness of its combat brigades and other units of the division (that is, 3rd ID is responsible for administrative control ‚ÄîADCON of its downtrace units), assuming they have not been deployed separately under a different division. The re-designed headquarters module comprises around 1,000 soldiers including over 200 officers. It includes: * A Main Command Post where mission planning and analysis are conducted * A mobile command group for commanding while on the move * (2) Tactical Command Posts to exercise control of brigades\\"We need two command posts.

In fact, AFC soldiers were to blend into Austin by not wearing their uniforms [to work side by side with civilians in the tech hubs], Milley noted in the 24 August 2018 press conference. Secretary Esper said he expected failures during the process of learning how to reform the acquisition and modernization process. The organizational design of AFC was informed by the cancellation of the Army's Future Combat Systems project. Under Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy reviewed the reasons for that cancellation. Thus \\"unity of command and purpose\\" was a criterion for the design by unifying previous modernization efforts in a single command; the sub-goals would be met in do-able chunks.Ryan McCarthy (06 October 2017) Army Directive 2017-24 (Cross-Functional Team Pilot In Support of Materiel Development)(12 Sep 2017) Army Directive 2017-22 (Implementation of Acquisition Reform Initiatives 1 and 2) The ratio of uniformed personnel to Army civilian employees is expected to be a talent- based, task-based issue for the AFC commander.The expectation is that these reforms will enable cultural change across the entire Army, as a part of attaining full operational capability.3 Pillars of AFC The Program Executive Offices (PEOs) of ASA (ALT) will have a dotted-line relationship with Futures Command.

Note that expertise, in say psychological operations, is not necessarily confined to the Active Army brigades; if some operation were to require the expertise of a National Guard unit for example, an echelon above brigade might require that a unit with the most modern materiel be formed, to utilize that expertise.

Williams (NOV 13, 2019) Air Force gears up for first 'connect-a-thon' for the first time. This exercise is denoted ABMS Onramp, and will occur at four month intervals. JADC2 is a joint multi-domain operation (MDO); the exercise will involve the Army's Long range fires, ground-based troops, and Sentinel radar. The Air Force contributes F-22s and F-35s, while the Navy is bringing F-35Cs and a destroyer to ABMS Onramp.Theresa Hitchens (6 Dec 2019, updated 5:21pm) First Multi Domain C2 Exercise Planned: ABMS Onramp Theresa Hitchens (21 Jan 2020) ABMS Demos Speed New Capabilities To Warfighters connections: C130 to LEO Starlink; F22 to F35; The December 2019 exercise used a NORTHCOM scenario.

If a standard exists, such as 5G, or APIs, use it. 27:50 A culture change, elevating data in importance, over bullets, will be required to win wars. Simplification of the ABMS user interface will be necessary, in order to present the relevant mission-dependent data to the Soldier, or Combatant commander. 31:30 There will be so much happening, that phone calls will be seen as the obstacle they are, during ABMS Onramp, just like the COVID-19 data needs. 35:00 deviceONE operates on SIPRNET tablets today. Portions of ABMS are operational today (25 August 2020). 39:50 a devOps mentality will be required; X as a Service (XaaS) is needed for Developer's adaptability and agility in the face of uncertain threats an OODA loop with 4-month cycles. Agility and adaptability are needed for the Onramps.

Commanders were shown they had the same access to a Common Operational Picture, displayed on their tablets at the flight line, as they had on their screens earlier in the command center. The data feeds used both 4G and 5G, as well as cloud-based AI feeds, to form the kill chains. The kill chains directing the intercepts were developed from 60 data feeds, and took seconds to develop, as opposed to the minutes which previous processes took. Other 'sensor-to-shooter' kill chains included AIM-9 missiles launched from F-16s and MQ-9s, as well as a ground-launched AIM-9 missile (which was designed to be an air-to-air munition). Four National Test Ranges were involved in the demonstration, as well as five combatant commands.

Schoomaker's plan was to resource units based on the mission they are expected to accomplish (major combat versus SASO, or stability and support operations), regardless of component (active or reserve). Instead of using snapshot readiness reports, the Army now rates units based on the mission they are expected to perform given their position across the three force pools ('reset', 'train/ready', and 'available').

The Army would serve as an expeditionary force to fight a protracted campaign against terrorism and stand ready for other potential contingencies across the full-spectrum of operations (from humanitarian and stability operations to major combat operations against a conventional foe). Under ideal circumstances, Army units would have a minimum \\"dwell time,\\" a minimum duration of which it would remain at home station before deployment. Active- duty units would be prepared to deploy once every three years. Army Reserve units would be prepared to deploy once every five years. National Guard units would be prepared to deploy once every six years. A total of 71 combat brigades would form the Army's rotation basis, 42 from the active component with the balance from the reserves. Thus, around 15 active-duty combat brigades would be available for deployment each year under the 2006 force- generation plan. An additional 4 or 5 brigades would be available for deployment from the reserve component. The plan was designed to provide more stability to soldiers and their families. Within the system, a surge capability would exist so that about an additional 18 brigades could be deployed in addition to the 19 or 20 scheduled brigades. From General Dan McNeil, former Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) Commander: Within the Army Forces Generation (ARFORGEN) model, brigade combat teams (BCTs) would move through a series of three force pools;GEN Charles C. Campbell (June 2009), \\"ARFORGEN: Maturing the Model, Refining the Process\\". Army Magazine, AUSA.org they would enter the model at its inception, the \\"reset force pool\\", upon completion of a deployment cycle. There they would re-equip and reman while executing all individual predeployment training requirements, attaining readiness as quickly as possible. Reset or \\"R\\" day, recommended by FORSCOM and approved by Headquarters, Department of the Army, would be marked by BCT changes of command, preceded or followed closely by other key leadership transitions. While in the reset pool, formations would be remanned, reaching 100% of mission required strength by the end of the phase, while also reorganizing and fielding new equipment, if appropriate. In addition, it is there that units would be confirmed against future missions, either as deployment expeditionary forces (DEFs-BCTs trained for known operational requirements), ready expeditionary forces (REFs-BCTs that form the pool of available forces for short-notice missions) or contingency expeditionary forces (CEFs-BCTs earmarked for contingency operations). Based on their commanders' assessments, units would move to the ready force pool, from which they could deploy should they be needed, and in which the unit training focus would be at the higher collective levels. Units would enter the available force pool when there is approximately one year left in the cycle, after validating their collective mission-essential task list proficiency (either core or theater-specific tasks) via battle-staff and dirt-mission rehearsal exercises. The available phase would be the only phase with a specified time limit: one year. Not unlike the division-ready brigades of past decades, these formations would deploy to fulfill specific requirements or stand ready to fulfill short-notice deployments within 30 days. The goal was to generate forces 12‚Äì18 months in advance of combatant commanders' requirements and to begin preparing every unit for its future mission as early as possible in order to increase its overall proficiency. Personnel management would also be reorganized as part of the Army transformation. Previously, personnel was managed on an individual basis in which soldiers were rotated without regard for the effect on unit cohesion. This system required unpopular measures such as \\"stop loss\\" and \\"stop move\\" in order to maintain force levels. In contrast, the new personnel system would operate on a unit basis to the maximum extent possible, with the goal of allowing teams to remain together longer and enabling families to establish ties within their communities. Abrams 2016 noted that mid-level Army soldiers found they faced an unexpected uptempo in their requirements, while entry-level soldiers in fact welcomed the increased challenge. =Sustainable Readiness Model= This model is \\"a structured progression of increased unit readiness over time, resulting in recurring periods of availability of trained, ready, and cohesive units prepared for operational deployment in support of geographic Combatant Commander requirements\\".Army Regulation AR 10‚Äì87 Glossary (11 December 2017) \\"Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units\\" p.53 Sean Kimmons (October 11, 2018) Second phase of Multi-Domain Task Force pilot headed to Europe ARFORGEN was replaced by the Sustainable Readiness Model (SRM) in 2017.

The Regular Army would move from 33 brigade combat teams in 2003 to 43 brigade combat teams together with 75 modular support brigades, for a total of 118 Regular Army modular brigades. In addition the previously un- designated training brigades such as the Infantry Training Brigade at Fort Benning assumed the lineage & honors of formerly active Regular Army combat brigades. In 2017 there were 31 brigade combat teams in the Active Army. Within the Army National Guard, there were to be 28 brigade combat teams and 78 support brigades. Within the Army Reserve, the objective was 59 support brigades.(Chief of Staff Mark Milley credits a previous Chief, Creighton Abrams, for placing most of the support brigades in the reserve and national guard, in order to insure that the nation would use the total army, rather than only the active army alone, in an extended war involving the entire nation.)

Thirty installations would have been affected; six of these installations would have accounted for over 12,000 of those to be let go. In early 2015, the plan was to cut entire BCTs; by July 2015, a new plan, to downsize a BCT (4,500 soldiers) to a maneuver battalion task force (1,032 soldiers, with the possibility of upsizing if need be) was formulated. In 2015, a plan was instituted to allow further shrinking of the Army, by converting selected brigades to maneuver battalion task forces.Army to re-align brigades, Army.mil, accessed 2015-07-10 A maneuver battalion task force includes about 1,050 Soldiers rather than the 4,000 in a full BCT.

She first appeared in Thunderbolts #1 (April 1997). Fictional character biography Dallas Riordan's family had a long storied history of being police officers.Thunderbolts #5 Dallas was once an NYPD officer and a soldierThunderbolts #41 before she went into politics and became the aide to the New York mayor.Thunderbolts #1 When the Thunderbolts appeared on the scene after the disappearances of the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, the mayor wanted to take advantage of the Thunderbolts publicity and chose to appoint Dallas as the liaison between his office and the new team of \\"heroes\\". Dallas was completely unaware that her new associates were really super villains in disguise, plotting to use their newfound publicity to get security clearances with which they could take over the world.Thunderbolts #1-10 Dallas quickly began a flirtation with Thunderbolt member Atlas and the two were dating when the group was exposed as villains.Thunderbolts #5, #10 The Thunderbolts, led by Citizen V (by now Baron Helmut Zemo once again), soon made an attempt to take over the world.Thunderbolts #11 To save face, the mayor chose to blame Dallas for leading him astray and promptly fired her.Thunderbolts #10, 15 A short time later, Dallas was approached by Roger Aubrey of the V-BattalionThunderbolts #42 and was offered the role of Citizen V (the original Citizen V was a Golden Age hero murdered by Helmut's father Baron Heinrich Zemo), their primary field agent.Thunderbolts #-1: Distant Rumblings It turned out that Dallas's grandfather had worked for the original V-Battalion (the majority of which were slaughtered by Heinrich). He had served in World War II but stayed in Europe to help recreate the V-Battalion with Roger Aubrey and various others, leaving his wife and son, Jim Riordan, behind.Thunderbolts #42 Jim raised Dallas to be tough and encouraged her desire to be a police officer. Jim did not like the V-Battalion but he presumably wanted his daughter to be trained in combat so that she would be prepared if she ever accepted a role in the V-Battalion (as was her right, being a descendant of a member). Furious over the way her life had been destroyed by the Thunderbolts, Dallas decided to join the V-Battalion and became Citizen V. She became somewhat of a super-hero herself, first fighting Baron ZemoThunderbolts #17 and then going up against the threat of the Crimson Cowl, who after knocking Citizen V unconscious,Thunderbolts #24 framed Dallas for being the leader of the Masters of Evil, which was all a set-up to throw the Thunderbolts off the trail of the real Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer).Thunderbolts #25, #42, #65 Dallas was then arrested. Dallas was rescued from prison by the V-Battalion.Thunderbolts #27 She soon tried to track down the Crimson CowlThunderbolts #30 but instead found herself fighting the Imperial Forces of America (ironically, but unknown to her, they were funded by Baron Zemo).Thunderbolts #31-32 The V-Battalion ordered Dallas to assassinate Henry Peter GyrichThunderbolts #35 (who would become her co-worker in the Commission on Superhuman Activities several years later) because Gyrich and the CSA had been compromised by the nanite conspiracy spearheaded by Baron Strucker of HYDRA.Thunderbolts #48-50, Citizen V and the V Battalion #1-3 Dallas refused and the V-Battalion sent their operatives to stop her from informing the Thunderbolts of their plans.Thunderbolts #36-39 When Dallas returned to the United States, she tried to get help from the Thunderbolts but a battle broke out between the two groups and Dallas vanished in battle, kidnapped again by the Crimson Cowl.Thunderbolts #39 Dallas wound up in a prison base on the border of Symkaria and Latveria.Thunderbolts #40-42 She managed to find a means of escape but chose to confront the Cowl instead. The battle ended with her falling off a bridge and into a river.Thunderbolts #42 Dallas washed up in LatveriaThunderbolts #43 (the country led by Doctor Doom) and her back was crushed, requiring her to use a wheelchair for mobility. Dallas soon began to get visitations from her ex-boyfriend ErikThunderbolts #51, #54 (who had been killed by Scourge).Thunderbolts #47 Eventually Dallas was freed from Latveria by the Redeemers at which point she came back to the United States.Thunderbolts #51-52 The Thunderbolts, who had previously disbanded, reunited during a battle with Graviton. Dallas reasoned that the ionic-powered Erik's visitations were similar to Wonder Man's visitations of the Scarlet Witch, who he used as an emotional anchor to tie him to the world after he had been killed. Erik didn't have a body to come back to and instead channeled his ionic energy into Dallas. In their ionic state, Dallas's body could walk and had various super powers. Atlas rejoined the Thunderbolts to fight Graviton but after the battle, Erik and Dallas found themselves and their teammates marooned on Counter Earth. When they returned, the ionic energy recreated a powerless Erik Josten and Dallas retained a portion of the ionic energy.Thunderbolts #74-75 Thanks to the Fixer, Erik soon gained Pym Particle- related powers again.Thunderbolts #75 Dallas joined the Thunderbolts as Vantage and chose to remain on the team to watch Zemo, who she could not trust. Eventually Helmut was scarred by a deranged Moonstone when trying to save Captain America. The Thunderbolts briefly disbanded and Erik asked Hank Pym to strip him of his new powers. Dallas and Erik broke up and Dallas took a job working for homeland security.Avengers/Thunderbolts #1-6 Erik soon rejoined the Thunderbolts despite being powerless.New Thunderbolts #1 After an encounter with Genis-Vel, Erik became enraged and tapped into his ionic powers which somehow left Dallas paralyzed again.New Thunderbolts #8 Dallas is currently a full-time member of the CSA and even helped organize the battle between the Thunderbolts and the new Avengers.New Thunderbolts #13-14 Dallas and the CSA are apparently working with Zemo to save the world from the Grandmaster. Dallas does not trust Helmut, but gave him the benefit of the doubt.New Thunderbolts #14-18, Thunderbolts #100-108 Altered again by the Wellspring, during a battle against the Grandmaster in which he had to surrender his powers temporarily to Zemo, Josten was left stuck in a giant form, too heavy even to move and communicate. However he was able to send back some ionic energy to Dallas, restoring her legs. She offered jobs to Abner Jenkins and Fixer within the CSA.Thunderbolts #108-109 During the Dark Reign storyline, Dallas Riordan appeared as part of senate sub committee questioning Norman Osborn about the recent Skrull invasion.Thunderbolts #126 Powers and abilities Dallas Riordan has no powers. As Vantage, Dallas once possessed superhuman levels of agility and endurance. While sharing consciousness with Atlas, Vantage was charged with ionic energy and could grow to great heights, fire ionic blasts, create a protective energy field, and fly. Notes Dallas is not the granddaughter of John Watkins Sr, the original Citizen V, nor is she the granddaughter of Watkins's lover Paulette Brazee and the red-headed soldier she married after Watkins death. Dallas's father Jim Riordan was born to an American couple. Jim's father was a soldier in WWII who stayed in Europe after the war and helped recreate the V-Battalion in 1951, but he died soon afterwards.Thunderbolts #42 Jim's mother was left to raise her son alone. Dallas used the family history of John Watkins the 3rd as her cover story when she explained her origin to Captain America, but he immediately saw through the deception.Captain America/Citizen V annual 1998 JJ Watkins, the son of John Sr and Paulette and father to John Watkins the 3rd, is presumably unrelated to the Riordan family. Dallas was offered the mantle of Citizen V because of her grandfather's sacrifice in the early days of the reconstituted V-Battalion.Thunderbolts #42 The official handbook entry on Dallas Riordan is incorrect in these matters.

Unfortunately, Thomas tore his ACL playing defensive end because of injuries to other players at the position. The Badgers finished that season 10‚Äì3 with a #15 national ranking. Soon after the game, Thomas announced that he would be returning to Wisconsin for his final year. His senior season in 2006 began with high expectations. As the offensive captain, he started all 13 games and blocked for P. J. Hill, Jr., who recorded over 1,500 rushing yards. Following the regular season, Thomas won the Outland Trophy as the nation's top interior lineman, and he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American.

Thomas' iron man consecutive snap streak ended at 10,363 on October 22, 2017, when he injured his triceps while blocking the Tennessee Titans' Brian Orakpo. The next day, it was revealed that he suffered a torn triceps in his left arm, which prematurely ended his 2017 season as he was placed on injured reserve. On November 4, the Browns gave Thomas a raise in pay. =Retirement= On March 14, 2018, Thomas announced his retirement from the NFL.

In April 2020, Thomas was named to the NFL 2010s All-Decade team.

He was a 3-time and undefeated Titan in the Central Division, but missed out on being the Central Champion. Thomas is a partner in some franchises of Mission BBQ.

The game takes place in the future, where real sport has been overtaken in favour of virtual sport, the most popular of which is Assault Rigs, a tank simulator set inside a 3D virtual environment. The goal of the single player game is to collect all of the gems in a level, while destroying or avoiding enemies, ultimately reaching the exit. There are 42 levels featuring jump ramps, elevators, skyways, trenches, movable blocks and push rods. There are 20 weapon power-ups, viruses and Dolby Surround sound. The game has four themes of tanks/environment: VR, Industrial, Military and War. Assault Rigs also has the capability to utilize the PlayStation Link Cable, enabling two players to connect two PlayStations and play head-to-head on two televisions. This setup unlocks 15 additional levels that are only available for play using the cable. The MS-DOS version has multi-player which can be played with either a serial link (two player) or a network (up to eight players). SoftBank planned to release the Sega Saturn version of the game in the US, along with Wipeout, Destruction Derby, and Krazy Ivan, however only Wipeout was released. Gameplay Players control their rig to collect all the gems in a level and get to the end goal of each of the game's 42 levels. In the Saturn version all of the levels were the same as the PlayStation and PC versions, but they were given different names. Along the way, they can collect various types of weapons from missiles to land mines. Throughout each level, they must contend with various enemies from turrets to enemy rigs. Aerial enemies called \\"viruses\\" also attack the player's rig, while hazards such as electric gates and enemy mines dot each level. There are also mild puzzle-solving elements such as pushing blocks and building bridges. Reception Air Hendrix of GamePro gave the PlayStation version a mixed review.

Details in the flowers are already discernible but recovering the shadows in post-production will increase noise. EV) and its histogram. Details in the shadows are already discernible and the flowers are fully recoverable in post-production. In digital photography, exposing to the right (ETTR) is the technique of adjusting the exposure of an image as high as possible at base ISO (without causing unwanted saturation) to collect the maximum amount of light and thus get the optimum performance out of the digital image sensor. The name derives from the resulting image histogram which, according to this technique, should be placed close to the right of its display. Advantages include greater tonal range in dark areas, greater signal- to-noise ratio (SNR), fuller use of the colour gamut and greater latitude during post-production. The direction of the adjustment relative to the camera's meter reading depends on the dynamic range (or contrast ratio) of the scene. Typically, with low-contrast scenes, an increase in exposure over that indicated by the camera's meter will be required. When attempting a single- exposure of a high dynamic-range scene, a reduction in exposure from the meter's reading may be needed. In the final analysis, however, the camera's meter is irrelevant to ETTR since the ETTR exposure is established, not by a meter reading, but by the camera's exposure indicators, the histogram and/or the highlight-clipping indicators (blinkies/zebras). ETTR images requiring increased exposure may appear to be overexposed (too bright) when taken and must be correctly processed (normalized) to produce a photograph as envisaged. Care must be taken to avoid clipping within any colour channel, other than acceptable areas such as specular highlights. The principle is also applied in film photography in order to maximize the negative's latitude and density and achieve richer blacks when the image is printed slightly down. With high- dynamic-range scenes With the advancement of digital image sensors, the same ETTR technique may be applicable to scenes with a relatively high dynamic range (HDR) (high contrast within both bright highlights and dark shades in harshly lit scenes), previously in the domain of HDR techniques involving multiple exposures. , the better of the recent photographic imaging sensors of the 35 mm \\"full-frame\\" format can accommodate up to about 14 stops of engineering DR or 11.5 stops of useful photographic DR in the raw shooting mode. A complication to using ETTR with higher DR is the fact that the vast majority of photographic cameras can only display a histogram produced by its JPG processing engine. In-camera JPG engines tend to have a narrowed DR than the sensor and does not faithfully represent the underlying raw data. Also, the histogram of the JPG image produced in-camera, highly depends on the camera settings, and is therefore a rather inexact indication of the exposure of the raw image data; the right edge of the raw histogram is not displayed. Several approaches may be used for practicing ETTR in this situation. * Specific software, for instance RawDigger, FastRawViewer, Histogrammar or the discontinued Photobola Rawnalyze, can be used to compute the raw histogram. If a computer is not available for analysis when shooting, it may be used to pick best exposure from an exposure-bracketing sequence of images. * An in-camera approximation of the raw histogram is provided by a few cameras, such as Leica M8 and M9, and by Magic Lantern, the unofficial firmware \\"hack\\" for Canon DSLR cameras (which also includes an automatic ETTR option). * Some recent cameras offer settings for the JPG processing engine with higher DR which is somewhat closer to the sensor DR (for instance, S-Log2 gamma of Sony, Flat picture control of Nikon). * With other cameras, an workaround approach known as \\"UniWB\\" may be used. One should be careful when using rough in-camera histogram approximations, particularly with live histograms, because they may fail to display small highlights areas. In cases where the scene DR is within the sensor DR but much wider than the DR of the JPG engine, ETTR results in the JPG preview image exposed for the highlights and appearing dark, because the midtones range of the scene is recorded in the shadows range of the JPG preview, and the shadows range of the scene is not recorded in the JPG preview. Wide-DR-capable raw processing external software is required (e.g., Adobe Camera Raw / Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, DxO OpticsPro, Capture One, Raw Therapee). When facing higher-DR scenes, metering on most cameras tends to aim for the midtones, often clipping both extreme highlights and shadows of the JPG preview image (seen as spikes at the right and left edge of the JPG histogram, respectively). One might expect that this would automatically lead towards a raw histogram in which the right (highlights) range is neatly occupied as with ETTR. Unfortunately, metering algorithms in different cameras may produce very different results in such conditions. It is not uncommon that when shooting a scene with DR within the sensor DR, the default camera metering results in a raw image with blown highlights and ample empty space at the left side of the histogram. In such case, the ETTR principle of maximizing exposure to the point where the raw histogram is aligned to its right edge, requires a seemingly counterintuitive negative exposure compensation. This may be explained with the ETTR principle: to make best use of the additional DR, available with wide-DR sensors, the extra DR is used to expand the shadows end of the recording range, without increasing the raw highlight headroom. If the resulting shadows are unable to be processed to acceptable noise or tonal range, one has simply encountered a situation that cannot be taken with a single shot, and consideration could be given to HDR (High Dynamic Range) techniques requiring multiple exposures. If the latter is infeasible due to scene or camera motion, on may revert to the technique of exposing to the important highlights (abbr. ETTIH), which is in fact just a slight generalization of ETTR. With ETTR, exposure is maximized up to the constraint of preserving all highlights at the right edge of the histogram (a constraint implied by the hard saturation of the digital sensor). With ETTIH, exposure is maximized a bit further; the constraint is relaxed so that only the highlights deemed important are preserved before the right edge of the histogram, and the highlights deemed unimportant may fall into the saturation zone of the sensor. Typical examples of unimportant highlights include the sun, other very bright light-sources, and sharp-edged specular highlights like chrome car bumpers in the sun; however, one should avoid blowing areas with smooth luminosity gradients, for instance the sky around the sun, because these likely lead to visible sensor saturation artefacts (banding). Many cameras have over-exposure \\"blinkies\\", showing the location of blown highlights which is not evident from the histogram. Some cameras also have under-exposure \\"blinkies\\" as an exposure aid. Mirror-less cameras often have \\"preview zebras\\", which is another aid for being aware of and correcting over-exposure. Raw processing software may feature \\"highlights reconstruction\\" algorithms (currently unavailable in- camera) which are able to partially mitigate the negative visual impact of digital hard saturation of the three color channels, thus extending the range of blow-able unimportant highlights slightly. In general, whether one is dealing with a high-DR scene or a low-DR scene, both the process and aim of ETTR are the same: exposure is adjusted (forgetting the meter) until only dispensable highlights are clipping, thereby resulting in an image with the greatest signal-to-noise (and therefore the greatest image quality). In both cases, the practice of ETTR does not use or depend on the camera's meter. Rather, it uses and depends on the exposure indicators, either the histograms and/or the highlight indictors (blinkies/zebras), which, ideally, have been set to reflect as well as possible the maximal values of the underlying raw data.  Background  Comparison of linear and gamma-corrected tonal ranges, showing how each stop is recorded. ETTR was initially espoused in 2003 by Michael Reichmann on his website, after purportedly having a discussion with software engineer Thomas Knoll, the original author of Adobe Photoshop and developer of the Camera Raw plug-in. Their rationale was based on the linearity of CCD and CMOS sensors, whereby the electric charge accumulated by each subpixel is proportional to the amount of light it is exposed to (plus electronic noise). Although a camera may have a dynamic range of 5 or more stops, when image data is recorded digitally the highest (brightest) stop uses fully half of the discrete tonal values. This is because a difference of 1 stop represents a doubling or halving of exposure. The next highest stop uses half of the remaining values, the next uses half of what is left and so on, such that the lowest stop uses only a small fraction of the tonal values available. This may result in a loss of tonal detail in the dark areas of a photograph and posterization during post-production. By deliberately exposing to the right and then stopping down afterwards (during processing) the maximum amount of information is retained.  Limitations  The ETTR exposure is, by its very nature, established with a camera ISO setting that allows the exposure indicators (right edge of histogram or blinkies/zebras) to indicate when the sensor is at or near saturation for desired highlights. Most people will find this to be the camera's base (lowest, not false) ISO. However, depth of field requirements may demand such a high f-ratio, and motion-blur/camera- shake issues may demand such a fast shutter speed, that ETTR is not possible at this ISO setting. When this happens, one retains the spirit of ETTR (maximizing signal-to-noise) by making the exposure as high as possible subject to the shooting conditions. ISO may then be increased to bring the image up to a desired brightness. But, since increasing ISO does not actually increase sensor exposure (instead the sensor's signal gain is increased), it should be applied only after the actual exposure (set by the f-ratio and shutter speed) has been made as large as possible subject to shooting constraints. Live histograms and highlight-clipping indicators, which are almost always based on the processed JPEG rather than on the raw data, might indicate highlights are blown when in fact they are not and could be recoverable from a raw file. Therefore, it can be difficult to expose properly to the right without risking inadvertently blown highlights. This problem can often be mitigated by using camera tonal settings that allow the JPEG histograms and highlight-clipping indictors to best reflect the underlying raw data.

Overton Independent School District is a public school district based in Overton, Texas (USA). In addition to the immediate Overton vicinity, the district serves rural areas in eastern Smith and western Rusk counties. There are three campuses in Overton ISD - Overton High (Grades 9-12), Overton Middle (Grades 6-8), and Overton Elementary (Grades PreK-5). Overton's athletic mascot are Mustangs, so named for the wild horses which formerly occupied much of the area before it was first settled in 1869. Classified by the University Interscholastic League (for academic and athletic competition) as a 2A school, as of 2014 the Overton Mustangs participate in Division II, District 11 against Fruitvale, Maud, Mount Enterprise, Tenaha and Timpson. In 2013 Overton High School received secondary Gold Performance acknowledgments for College-Ready Graduates, and was commended in English and Social Studies. Overton Elementary also received Gold Performance acknowledgments and was commended in Math and Science, receiving comparable improvement recognition in reading. The elementary school district was rated \\"recognized\\" by the Texas Education Agency. Achieving a recognized rating requires meeting a standard of 80 percent or higher on the TAKS tests for each subject and student group. Athletics The Mustang football team competes in Coach Chester Roy Stadium, named in honor of the first African- American member of the faculty following Desegregation. Coach Roy's tenure spanned more than thirty years as a coach and educator, before his passing in 2005 and . Overton's football program is notable for having won at least one district championship in every single decade starting in the 1930s, including a string of state playoff appearances from the 1980s through the 1990s, with the most recent league title coming in 2012. During the 2008-2009 baseball season, in only their fifth year of existence, the Overton Mustang baseball team reached the state tournament in Round Rock before losing to the eventual state champion. The Mustang baseball team has continued this success into the 2009-2010 season, beginning the year ranked #1 in the state in Class 1A en route to a 30-3 regular season record, a first district championship, and a second consecutive appearance in the state semifinals. The Mustangs have returned to the post-season each year since, advancing to bi-district in 2013. Academics Overton's academic and fine arts programs are notable as well, with the marching band winning numerous state marching competitions throughout its history and the Theatre department making a string of State UIL One Act Play appearances, with a 20-year streak of district championships led by longtime Drama instructor Lillian Cohagen, who retired in 1980 . In 1997 OHS won a state Class 1A One Act Play championship with Confederate Letters, written and directed by Barre Gonzalez. A number of OHS graduates have attended prestigious schools of higher learning. In recent years graduates received scholarships to colleges as prestigious as in-state schools Baylor, TCU, Texas A&M; and Texas to such nationally-recognized institutions as Vassar College and Stanford.

Bredig was a faculty member at the University of Leipzig (1895-1901) and professor of chemistry at Heidelberg (1901‚Äì1910); Technische Hochschule, Zurich (1910); and Technische Hochschule, Karlsruhe (1911‚Äì1933). Bredig did fundamental research in catalysis, preparing aqueous colloidal dispersions of metals and comparing the catalytic properties of metal colloids to the action of enzymes (or \\"ferments\\"). He also made significant contributions in reaction kinetics and electrochemistry. Despite being a highly respected scientist in his field, Bredig was forced to leave the university by the National Socialists in 1933, ending his teaching and research career. Princeton University offered Bredig a pro forma position, enabling him to emigrate to the United States in 1940.  Life  Georg Bredig was the son of Max Bredig (1842-1899) and his wife Ernestine (Troplowitz) Bredig (1847-1930). He was born on October 1, 1868, in Glogau, Niederschlesien, Silesia Province. The family was of Jewish descent, but Bredig identified himself as a Protestant. Like Fritz Haber, another German chemist of Jewish descent, Bredig felt a deeply patriotic attachment to Germany. = Education and early catalysis research = In 1886, Bredig began studying natural sciences at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg. After one term he moved to Friedrich-Wilhelm University in Berlin (later Humboldt University of Berlin) where he studied from 1886-1889. Among his teachers were August Wilhelm von Hofmann, August Kundt, Siegmund Gabriel and (1854-1919). Will was instrumental in introducing Bredig to the work of Wilhelm Ostwald of the University of Leipzig, and the new field of physical chemistry. Fascinated by this branch of research Bredig moved to the University of Leipzig in autumn 1889. There he studied with Ostwald, earning his doctorate in 1894 with a two- part dissertation, discussing I. Beitr√§ge zur St√∂chiometrie. Ionenbewegung; II. √úber die AfÔ¨Ånit√§tsgr√∂√üen d. Basen, (I. Contributions to stoichiometry. Ion motion; II. About the affinities of Bases). Another outcome of his work was that Bredig introduced the idea of a Zwitterion, a dipolar ion with at least one positive and one negative functional group, and a net charge of zero. Bredig spent the next year and a half doing postdoctoral work at the laboratories of J. H. van't Hoff in Amsterdam, M. Berthelot in Paris and S. Arrhenius in Stockholm. In autumn 1895, he returned to the University of Leipzig as an assistant to Wilhelm Ostwald. The two men had much in common, including interests in pacifism and internationalism. In 1898 Bredig discovered that it is possible to make colloidal solutions of metals usable as catalysts. Bredig's arc method became the preferred chemical method of creating metallic solutions. He expanded upon this work by studying and comparing the activity of metal colloids and that of inorganic ferments (his name for biological enzymes). In 1899, the Deutsche Elektrochemische Gesellschaft (German Electrochemical Society, founded 1894) awarded an honorary prize to Bredig for his work. Bredig habilitated in Leipzig in 1901, publishing the dissertation Anorganische Fermente (Inorganic ferments). He was granted his teaching licence (venia legendi) after speaking on the topic \\"√úber die Chemie der extremen Temperaturen\\" (\\"On the chemistry of extreme temperatures\\"). In 1901 Bredig married Rosa Fraenkel. The couple had two children, Max Albert Bredig (1902-1977) and Marianne Bredig (1903-1987). Max Albert Bredig also became a chemist, eventually working at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Marianne Bredig married Dr. Viktor Homburger. = Research at Heidelberg and Zurich = Also in 1901, Bredig was appointed as associate professor at the University of Heidelberg, the first professor there in physical chemistry. With the support of Theodor Curtius at Heidelberg, Bredig was able to establish his own research program, which led to great progress in catalytic research. One of his achievements at Heidelberg was the first catalytic synthesis of asymmetric carbon compounds, selectively synthesizing specific stereoisomer molecules. In addition to catalysis, his primary areas of research were reaction kinetics and electrochemistry. In addition to his work on organic and inorganic catalysts, he and his students contributed to the areas of kinetics of adiabatic reactions, amphoteric electrolytes and ampholytic ions, and the catalytic decomposition kinetics of ethyl diazoacetate. As a teacher, he attracted many young, talented scientists from all over the world. Among Bredig's students at Heidelberg were Kasimir Fajans, James William McBain, and Andreas von Antropoff. In 1910 Bredig was appointed as full professor at Technische Hochschule, Zurich. = Technische Hochschule, Karlsruhe = In 1911, Bredig was appointed as professor for physical chemistry at the Technische Hochschule, Karlsruhe. The chair of physical chemistry at Karlsruhe was created in 1900 and held first by (1900-1905), and then by Fritz Haber (1905-1911). Haber left to become Headmaster of the newly founded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry in Berlin. Haber and Bredig, in spite of great differences in personality and political positions, were good friends. Bredig's students at Karlsruhe included Michael Polanyi. Bredig sent Polyani's work on the third law of thermodynamics to Albert Einstein for review, beginning a correspondence between them. World War I and its aftermath were extremely disruptive to work in Bredig's institute at Karlsruhe. Most of the students had to leave. Bredig may have worked as assistant to the Red Cross during the war. The postwar- period was dominated by time-consuming teaching duties and administrative work. It was difficult to obtain supplies due to shortages and hyperinflation. In 1922, Bredig participated in the International Chemical Reunion in Utrecht, the first meeting of chemists from Germany, Austria, England and the USA since the beginning of the war. It was a step towards the rebuilding of peaceful discourse and scientific internationalism, led by Bredig's friend Ernst Cohen and his colleague of the University of Utrecht. On December 9, 1922, Bredig became Rector (headmaster) at Karlsruhe. In his inaugural speech, Denkmethoden der Chemie (Thinking Methods of Chemistry), Bredig was open about his political beliefs, which could be described as liberal-democratic, supporting pacifism and internationalism. This caught the negative attention of the National Socialists. Bredig had to undergo surgery twice in 1924 and 1929/30 but he recovered quickly and was able to return to his work. = Persecution and exile = On January 30, 1933 Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist (Nazi) party assumed power, and began to use a variety of laws to enforce their agenda. As early as April 7, 1933 the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service banned Jews and other persons who the Nazis considered unfit to hold office from the German Civil Service and German universities. This created large numbers of vacancies: an estimated 26% of chemists and biochemists were driven from posts at German and Austrian universities. Required with other professors at German universities to take an oath of allegiance pledging his loyalty to Adolf Hitler, Bredig refused. He was forced out of the university in 1933 by the National Socialists, ending his teaching and research activities. The \\"retirement\\" of Bredig and other senior scientists such as Stefan Goldschmidt and Paul Askenasy left a significant gap in the university's expertise. In addition Bredig suffered the loss of his wife, who died in 1933. Regardless, he remained in Karlsruhe. His son Max Albert Bredig was warned by colleagues and left his job in Berlin in 1937, taking only his books. He succeeded in reaching Sweden, England, and eventually the United States, joining Kasimir Fajans at the University of Michigan. From the United States, he worked to rescue his father, his sister, her husband, and others. In November 1938, during Kristallnacht, most of the male Jewish population of Karlsruhe was arrested and sent to Dachau concentration camp. Georg Bredig and his son-in-law Dr. Viktor Homburger were among the 500 Jews arrested. They were released after showing proof of their intention to emigrate. In 1939 Bredig was persuaded to leave Germany for the Netherlands. His long-time friend Ernst Cohen helped him to get an entry permit. Ironically, Cohen himself would die in Auschwitz concentration camp. Princeton University offered Bredig a pro forma position, enabling him to reach the United States in 1940. He was in poor health, and stayed with his son in New York City until he died on April 24, 1944. Bredig was concerned that the Nazis would destroy his papers. Before leaving, he sent his letters, books, photographs, and scientific notes out of Nazi Germany to the Netherlands where they was kept in safety until the end of World War II. In 1946 his papers were returned to the Bredig family, who were then in the United States. In 2019, the Science History Institute acquired the archival collection. It covers the period from the late 19th century to the late 1930s, including the Nazi's rise to power.  Works     * (Autobiography).

Production history This game was created by the co-founders of the Canadian firm Distinctive Software, Don Mattrick and Jeff Sember, who sold it to Accolade. Game play The protagonist of the game is wisecracking secret agent Steve Keene. In the first scene, Keene is summoned to headquarters by his chief, who sends him on one of two missions. Game play involves multiple adventures in two arenas: panels of a comic book page where dialogue and actions are selected for Steve that may or may not determine what will happen on the next panel (similar to the Choose Your Own Adventure book format); and traditional scrolling action boards where Steve is a moving character doing the physical task necessary (e.g. swimming, jumping, shooting) to advance through the stage. Steve can lose a life inside the comic page portions as well as the motion portions. If this happens, the game \\"rewinds\\" a few panels, forcing the player to re-do these panels until the crisis point is reached again.

The first team was called Fanum Fortunae and followed by Emilio Caiani of Milan who imported the not so famous football. On 13 May 1915, in Circolo di San Paterniano, the city's patron, was born Alma Juventus Football Club among young players. In 1925 the company raced the first regional championship of Marche, Terza Divisione. In 1930 was inaugurated the new stadium \\"Borgo Metauro\\" now entitled to a player who played in the series of Fano further, Raffaele Mancini. In 1935 it competed for the first time in Serie C, playing against famous teams such as Venezia, Vicenza, Rimini, Udinese, Treviso, Ancona, Mantova. That year, it also played a game against Milan. During the fascist, eagle with the beam was the symbol of the team. After World War II the beam was replaced with the coat of arms. Fano spend many years in Serie C1 and Serie C2, but didn't achieve promotion to Serie B. Some years Fano had been relegated to Serie D. In the 2008‚Äì09 season Fano, which was playing in Serie D, after have been leading the championship for many turns, in the last days was exceeded by Pro Vasto, and finished second in the league, a position that allowed it to play in the playoffs and to participate in the 2009‚Äì10 Coppa Italia against Lumezzane.

Westfaling was born in London, England, the son of Harbert Westphaling, whose family originated in Westphalia (Germany). He studied at Christ Church, Oxford from the age of 15, graduating with a BA in 1551 and MA in 1555. He went on to take a BTh in 1561, and DTh in 1566. He was ordained in February 1562 by Bishop of London Edmund Grindal, and subsequently appointed a Canon of Christ Church, Oxford. At the end of 1562, he was appointed Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity, but remained in the post for only a little over a year. After continuing his career in the church he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford in June 1576, and as a Canon at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle the following May. After his consecration as Bishop of Hereford on 30 January 1586, Westfaling became known for his zeal in confronting Roman Catholics and others whose religious practises he viewed as suspect, criticising Hereford's vicars choral for their use of \\"superstitious\\" images and pictures. He was also noted for the gravity and academic tone of his preaching. In 1592 he preached before Elizabeth I in the university church. Despite the Queen twice ordering him to cut his oration short to allow her to deliver a speech, Westfaling refused to be hurried and the Queen's speech was postponed until the next day. Westfaling was the author of a collection of sermons entitled A Treatise of Reformation in Religion, and also authored a number of poems in English and Latin, now in the library of the University of Cambridge. Westfaling died in Hereford on 1 March 1602, and an impressive and austere effigy marks the location of his burial in the north transept of Hereford Cathedral. His will included generous provisions for his servants and for the poor of the city of Hereford and his parish at Whitbourne.

Born in 1940 in Cairo, Egypt to an Assyrian family from Lebanon, Tamraz grew up speaking fluent English, French and Arabic. His early schooling was at the prestigious English School in Cairo. He subsequently attended the American University in Cairo, Cambridge University in a Ph.D. programme, and the Institut Europ√©en d‚ÄôAdministration (INSEAD) in Fontainebleau, France. He received an MBA in 1966 from Harvard Business School, where his classmates included many future leaders in Western and international governments and businesses. New York Daily News, March 27, 1981Fortune, November 1973 Tamraz served for many years as a member of the Board of Trustees of the American University in Cairo, where he endowed a number of named scholarships for Egyptian students of exceptional promise. He became a U.S. citizen in 1989.  Lebanon: Intra Bank and Bank Al Mashrek  Tamraz's first notable business enterprise was in 1967, when as an executive of the Wall Street investment bank Kidder, Peabody & Co., he successfully refloated a large Lebanese bank called Intra Bank, which had become insolvent in 1966. The bank had been founded in Beirut in 1951 by Yousef Beidas and three partners as a currency trading house named International Traders. The bank stopped payments on October 14, 1966. The collapse of the bank brought the Lebanese economy to a halt and sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East. Intra Bank accounted for 15% of total bank deposits and 38% of all deposits with Lebanese-owned banks. It owned nine other banks, controlled 35 companies and employed 43,000 people at the time of its collapse.\\"The Day the Doors Closed,\\" TIME Magazine, October 28, 1966\\"How They Broke the Bank,\\" TIME Magazine, November 25, 1966 The collapse was followed by its restructuring, under a plan known as the ‚ÄúKidder Peabody Plan,‚Äù which was engineered by Tamraz (who served for years as its chairman and chief executive officer), under which the deposit obligations of the old Intra Bank were replaced with shares in a new company named Intra Investment Company (IIC), one of the major sovereign wealth investment companies in the Middle East. The major shareholders of IIC were the Lebanese government, along with the governments of Kuwait, Qatar and the United States, all of which had been major depositors in the former bank. IIC remained a major shareholder in key institutions such as Middle East Airlines (Tamraz was the Vice Chairman of the airline for a number of years, with special responsibility for its finances, banking relationships and aircraft purchases), Casino du Liban and Bank Al Mashrek, which carried out the remaining banking operations. Kidder Peabody continued to advise the board of IIC until 1973 under an advisory contract, at which time the relationship was discontinued.\\"Rescue in Beirut,\\" TIME Magazine, October 20, 1967\\"Reopening at Intra,\\" TIME Magazine, January 5, 1968Newsweek, February 10, 1975  SUMED, Bank of the Commonwealth, Tamoil, Meurice, Baku-Ceyhan  After leaving Intra Bank in the early 1970s, Tamraz continued his investment banking activities, dealing with most major companies and governments in the area. His early background gave him an unusual ability to bridge East and West, while his educational background and fluency in Arabic quickly made him a trusted banker and adviser throughout the Middle East. Working with the government of Kuwait, for instance, he reorganized Gulf Fisheries, a company with over 200 ocean- going fishing vessels worldwide, and supervised and priced its takeover by the Kuwaiti government. At the same time, he also worked with Egypt Air and the Egyptian government to completely re-equip the airline‚Äôs fleet with new Boeing passenger aircraft.Fortune, November 1973 Tamraz acquired ownership of Chantiers Navals de la Ciotat (CNC), the second-largest shipyard in France, in the early 1970s. This company was one of the early pioneers in the construction of LNG vessels for oceangoing natural gas transport, and also specialized in submarines, patrol boats and other military platforms. In addition, the yard constructed very large crude carriers (VLCC5) and conventional bulk cargo vessels for the civilian maritime industry. In the 1970s, Tamraz conceived, financed and built the well-known long Suez- Mediterranean (SUMED) Pipeline in Egypt, considered as ‚Äúone of the world‚Äôs greatest engineering feats‚Äù, a pipeline designed to run parallel to the blocked Suez Canal, which had been closed since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Using Bechtel Corporation as prime contractor, the pipeline, which comprises two parallel 42-inch lines, was opened in 1978 with a capacity of . Completion of an additional pumping station in 1994 increased capacity to its current .Fortune, November 1973 Concurrently with the SUMED project, Tamraz conceived and financed the world‚Äôs largest chemical methanol plant in Jubail, Saudi Arabia in partnership with Japan‚Äôs Itochu Corporation and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Tamraz continued subsequently as an advisor to Itochu senior management, especially on Middle East energy strategy. The methanol project included a five-year, preferential crude oil supply contract for Japan that was signed with the Saudi government during the 1973 oil crisis. In 1976, Tamraz moved into United States financial markets with his acquisition of Bank of the Commonwealth, a Michigan-based bank with 50 branches. He strengthened and expanded the bank until 1983, when it was merged into the founding of Comerica, Inc., now one of the largest super-regional U.S. bank holding companies. The merger made Tamraz the largest single shareholder in Comerica at the time, before selling out to finance the Tamoil acquisition described below. Comerica currently has assets of $64 billion and a market capitalization of $5.6 billion.New York Times, May 4, 1978 By the early 1980s, Tamraz became the 100% owner of the Meurice Hotel Group in Paris, which owned the Meurice (H√¥tel Meurice, Prince de Galles and Grand Hotels, as well as the famed Cafe de la Paix. At the time, the 1,000 rooms of these three hotels comprised 25% of all the luxury hotel rooms in Paris. The properties were sold to Grand Metropolitan Hotel Corporation of London in the mid-1980s. Also during the 1980s, Tamraz founded and built Europe‚Äôs Tamoil Corporation by purchasing and combining all of the Italian assets of Amoco (Standard Oil Company of Indiana) and of Texaco Corporation (1,000 service stations each). Prior to selling, he expanded the company to 3,000 service stations, three refineries, an extensive pipeline distribution system and a refining capacity of of oil per day. Tamoil today has annual sales of $20 billion and a market capitalization of $6.3 billion. In the early 1990s, after the Soviet Union loosened its grip on Central Asia, Tamraz was the originator of the Baku- Ceyhan (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline) considered as ‚Äúone of the great engineering endeavours‚Äù, an oil pipeline project, to move of Caspian Sea oil to the Mediterranean Sea and thus to world markets. Tamraz managed to obtain support for the proposed pipeline from Turkmen President Niyazov, Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev, and Turkey's Prime Minister, Tansu √áiller, and Turkey's Botas company. Tamraz's companies negotiated and signed the original pipeline right-of-way transit agreement with the Government of Turkey. This agreement was essential to the success of the project, which was eventually completed by BP after its purchase of Amoco, with which Tamraz had been cooperating in the Central Asian area. During this period, Tamraz acquired equity ownership positions in Turkmenistan‚Äôs Blocks I and II two of that country‚Äôs major oil and gas producing properties. These fields have reserves of of gas and of oil, with 1,400 working wells, and currently produce two billion cubic feet per day of natural gas.Business Week, July 17, 1995 Netoil, Tamoil and Net Oil Oman Recently, Roger Tamraz‚Äôs Netoil group of companies has been in discussions with Libya to buy back Tamoil . Tamraz's strategy is to use the Tamoil acquisition to expand Netoil's existing energy businesses, which operate in the Middle East and Asia primarily through Netoil's Tamgaz subsidiary.

It is in the local government district of Mendip. The village lies in a small hollow near the summit of the Mendip range of hills, at an elevation of nearly above sea-level, and has evidence of occupation since neolithic times. There are remains of lead mining activities and caves in the limestone beneath the village. It is the venue for the annual Priddy Folk FestivalFolk Festival, and the Sheep Fair,Sheep Fair which has been held since 1348.  Etymology  Priddy, with medieval variations of spellings such as Predy, Priddie, Pridi, Pridia, Pridie and Prydde, is a name that has been ascribed to the Welsh influence that pre-dated the arrival of the Saxon English. It has been particularly attributed to pridd (= \\"earth\\"). This might be suggestive of the Iron Age mining activities. The Latin words pratum (= a meadow) and praedium (= a farm) have given rise to such Alpine names as Preda and Prada and it has been suggested that they are also the root for the cymric words prydd, pryddion meaning \\"production\\", as with a fertile meadow. \\"Priddy\\" could just mean \\"meadow land\\". An alternative explanation is 'The high water' from the Celtic prid and the Old English ea, and another alternative suggests it could come from the Welsh word preiddiau, pronounced preidhye, meaning flock or herd.  History  In 1977 a Mesolithic hut site was excavated at Priddy. Nearby are the Priddy Circles a Stone circle or Henge monument, which appears to be contemporary with Stonehenge, i.e. Neolithic circa 2180 BC. The North Hill location of two round barrow cemeteries, Ashen Hill and Priddy Nine-Barrows which are neighbours of the Circles, would seem to imply that the area to the north-east of Priddy held ritual significance into the Bronze Age. South of the village at Deer Leap is a Bronze Age burial mound and the remains of a medieval settlement of Ramspit. Drove Cottage Henge is a Neolithic ceremonial location to the east of the village. Hurdles at Priddy. No longer used but, it is said if they ever go the sheep fair will not be held again. Lead was being worked as far back as 300 to 200 BC. The area east and north-west of the village shows extensive patches of \\"gruffy ground\\". The word \\"gruffy\\" derives from the grooves that were formed where the lead ore was extracted from veins near the surface. The relatively easy opencast extraction of lead was a strong attraction for the Romans. Lead ingots found in the neighbourhood have been dated to AD 49. The ruins of St Cuthbert's Leadworks which closed in 1908 can still be seen. Although the village is not mentioned in the Domesday Book it appears to be the subject of a lost Saxon charter of the late 7th or 8th century. The parish was part of the hundred of Wells Forum. Mendip Farmers' Hunt Boxing Day meeting Since the 1920s, the kennels for the Mendip Farmers' Hunt fox hounds have been based near the village, but the hunt was planning to relocate them to Chewton Mendip, a move which has faced significant local opposition. The group starts a number of fox hunts from the village green, including one on Boxing Day. In 2014 a decision was made by Mendip District Council to allow the development of the kennels in the village. In April 2013 the stack of sheep hurdles on the green was set alight in an arson attack. In July 2013, locals remade The Hurdles.  Governance  The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wells Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.  Geography  Priddy Pools, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), were originally formed when the Romans started mining lead in the area. Priddy Caves are also an SSSI with the entrance to Swildon's Hole just outside the village. Priddy Mineries is a Nature Reserve as is Chancellor's Farm. The other caves of the Mendip Hills in and around Priddy include: Eastwater Cavern, Hunter's Hole, St Cuthbert's Swallet, and Wigmore Swallet.  Religious sites  St Lawrence Church at Priddy The Church of St Lawrence dates from the 13th century, with some rebuilding in the 15th century and was restored in 1881‚Äì1888; it is a Grade I listed building. The three bells in the church were augmented to five in 1997. The church includes a medieval altar frontal. According to supporters of the theory that Jesus of Nazareth visited Britain during his childhood, Priddy was the place where he traded metals with local miners.

The term was used for a faction within the German Green Party. The faction was formed in conflict to the Realo- faction within their party. The term has also been applied to similar conflicts. General meaning The abbreviation Fundi is a label applied to members who tend towards a fundamentalist interpretation of its common ideology (e.g. 'green' values), as opposed to the more \\"pragmatic realism\\" of the Realo alternative. Other terms for green Fundis are wild greens or deep greens. They tend towards veganism, a strong animal rights approach and an aversion to traditional political methods, preferring to maintain decentralized grassroots organization over a more centralized system of governance. German Greens In the 1980s and 1990s, a conflict between the Fundis and the Realos with the German Green Party arose. While the Realos, the group around Joschka Fischer, were in favour of moderate policies and cabinet cooperation, the Fundis opposed cabinet cooperation. The Fundis were composed of deep greens and eco-socialists. They did not only oppose cabinet cooperation, but were also in favour of strict term limits. The term was first used within the Hessen Green party. In the 1982 state elections the party gained 8% of vote, and neither the SPD or the CDU had a majority of their own. In their program Hessen Greens had claimed that there was a \\"fundamental opposition between the anti-life and anti-democratic politics of the SPD, CDU and FDP.\\" Those who had opposed a coalition with the SPD were called Fundis. The Greens tolerated an SPD-minority government for three years and in 1985 they entered the coalition, a victory for the Realos. Joschka Fischer became their minister. During the party congress on 22-23 June 1985 in Hagen, the Realos won a victory on the federal level when they adopted a motion, saying that the Greens could \\"use the full bandwidth of parliamentary possibilities, ranging from opposition to single-party government\\". At the end of the 1980s the Fundis founded the Left Forum. In 1990 a group of prominent eco-socialists left the party, in 1991 a group of deep greens also left. Some of those joined the PDS and others founded their own party. In 1998 the Greens joined the federal cabinet, a final victory for the Realos. In the following years the division between realos and Fundis became less important. Other uses In the Green Party of Canada and the Flemish party Agalev-party the term was also used to describe similar conflicts. In France conflicts between 'Fundi' and 'Realo' led to several splits within the Green Party, resulting in a 'pleiade' of green parties. In an article on the Greens/Green Party USA‚Äôs website, the organization characterized the split between itself and the Green Party of the United States (GPUS) as akin to the fundi‚Äìrealo split in the German Greens, with itself being the fundi wing and GPUS the realos. The term has been used to describe the ideological differences within the Australian Greens and its member parties.

The accident killed two people and injured 542 others. The 08:44-arriving commuter train failed to stop at Platform 3 of the terminus (colliding with its buffer stop) at around 10 mph. Accident The stopping service composed of 10 cars of elderly Class 415 and Class 416 units departed from Sevenoaks at 07:58, and had over 800 passengers on board after passing through the busy interchange at London Bridge. At 08:44 it collided with the buffer stop at the Cannon Street terminus within the City of London. The fifth and sixth carriages crushed into each other, lifting one off the tracks. A 24-year-old man, cut free from wreckage crushing his head and abdomen, died from a heart attack on the way to hospital. A 59-year-old woman died three days later from her injuries. 542 other passengers were injured, many because they had stood up ready to leave as the train entered the terminus platform. The inquiry put the impact speed at around 10 mph, higher than the rail operator's earlier estimates. Inquiry A report was compiled of the accident by Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate.A Report of the Collision that Occurred on 8 January 1991 at Cannon Street Station, at The Railways Archive No fault in the train's braking system could be found and the driver, Maurice Graham, was held to blame. He was not tested for drugs until three days after the accident, whereupon traces of cannabis were found in his system. The public inquiry found that there was insufficient evidence to prove drug use had caused the accident. The inquiry found that the cause of the accident was solely that of driver error. The report also made the following observations: * The age of the elderly trains increased the effect of the impact. Of the two coaches that suffered the worst damage, one was built on an underframe dating from 1934, having been refitted with a new body in 1953 and involved in a previous collision with a locomotive in 1958; the other was built on an underframe from 1928. * The interior design of the coaches' fittings and the large number of slam doors could have resulted in weaknesses in the structure of the rolling stock. * More research is needed on the effect of impacts on passengers, particularly standing passengers, on board commuter trains. * Automatic Train Protection, or ATP, should be installed as quickly as practicably possible. * On-train data recorders would make the finding of evidence easier following railway accidents. * Legislation should be introduced to make it an offence for railway staff with safety responsibilities to be intoxicated while on duty. (The main cause of the Eltham Well Hall rail crash). * Sliding buffer stops might have minimised the injury compared to the hydraulic buffer stops in this incident. * Arrangements for the booking-on of staff should be reviewed (a recommendation also made in the report for the Eltham Well Hall rail crash).

The design is similar to the TS-50 and VS-MK2 mine. It is blast resistant and can be used in a minimum metal configuration. Though unlikely to kill, the explosive charge contained within a VS-50 is quite sufficient to destroy the victim's foot: the blast is capable of penetrating 5 mm of mild steel leaving an 80 mm-diameter hole. Description The mine consists of three sections, a bottom section containing the main explosive charge, a middle section which contains the fuze and safety/arming mechanism, and the top section which consists of a neoprene pressure pad. The neoprene pressure pad is sometimes reinforced with an 18 gram mild steel plate, which makes the mine detectable by metal detectors. However, the majority of VS-50s were manufactured as minimal metal mines and are therefore much harder to detect. The case is waterproof and can be used in water up to one metre deep. The mine can be deployed by helicopters or ground vehicles or laid by hand.  Operation  A sustained downward force of approximately ten kilograms on the pressure plate for a minimum of 0.10 seconds compresses the firing spring and cocks the striker. Continuous downward movement allows the trigger assembly to pivot, slowly forcing the air out of an anti-shock bladder and flips the striker down into the stab sensitive M41 detonator, at which point the mine explodes. The air pressure delay mechanism effectively blocks detonation if the force on the pressure plate is of short duration, because air does not have enough time to leave the small anti-shock bladder. This has two direct applications, it allows the mine to be dropped from helicopter mine scattering systems, and it dramatically increases the mine's resistance to explosive- based mine clearance techniques. It can therefore be regarded as a blast resistant mine.  VS-50AR & VS-AR4 anti-handling devices  The VS-50AR is an electronically fuzed version of the mine which contains an integral mercury tilt switch, that operates as an anti-handling device. The VS-50AR has a dummy pressure plate on top and its external appearance is very similar to the VS-50, which has obvious implications for demining personnel. The VS-50AR contains a reduced explosive charge, but which is still sufficient to blow the victim's hands off. Additionally, Valsella manufactured a completely separate electronic anti-handling device known as the VS-AR4. This was a tilt-operated device, specifically designed to be fitted to any of the following Valsella products: the VS-50 (standard version, not the VS-50AR) and Valmara 69 anti- personnel mines, as well as the VS-1.6 and VS-1.2 anti-tank mines. The VS-AR4 has a series of fuze adaptors which allow it to be screwed into the bottom of any of those mines. It has a 10-minute mechanical arming delay (started by removing a pin) followed by a 30-minute electronic arming delay. The power source are two 1.5 V batteries and the operational life is longer than a year. Generally, the render safe procedure for VS-50 mines with anti-handling devices fitted is to detonate them in situ via a donor charge, or burn through the plastic casing using some form of special incendiary device.  Usage The mine has been encountered in Afghanistan, Angola, Ecuador, Iraq, Turkey, Kuwait, Lebanon, Peru, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, the Western Sahara and Zimbabwe.

It grows tall and prefers to take root in gravelly, rocky soils high up in piedmont plains, at elevation. It was botanically described in 1799. Because of its multiple uses, the demand for Asparagus racemosus is constantly on the rise. Because of destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction, and deforestation, the plant is now considered \\"endangered\\" in its natural habitat.  Description  Close-up on flowers Shatavari has small pine-needle-like phylloclades (photosynthetic branches) that are uniform and shiny green. In July, it produces minute, white flowers on short, spiky stems, and in September it fruits, producing blackish-purple, globular berries. It has an adventitious root system with tuberous roots that measure about one metre in length, tapering at both ends, with roughly a hundred on each plant. Uses Shatavari is important in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Extracts made from dried roots are used for various reproductive and hormonal issues in women. It is also used in cases of gastric ulcers and indigestion. Despite its long history of use in Ayurveda, few studies exist to support health effects of shatavari. Studies of its effects on lactation have shown mixed results. Its safety has not been well studied, however small trials have found no adverse effects in mothers or their babies. The key pharmacologic constituents of shatavari are steroidal saponins, mucilage, and alkaloids.

Biography Born in Shanghai, he and his English father and Russian mother fled when the Japanese attacked China five years later. His career was at its peak in the 1960s, with a series of leading roles in British science fiction films, including The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961 - a disaster film in which he played an alcoholic reporter during a time when two large nuclear explosions altered the Earth's axis, propelling the Earth towards the sun), First Men in the Moon (1964), and Island of Terror (1966). As well as starring in these films, he worked as a soap opera actor and performed other character parts on television. His roles in these science fiction films were highly praised by audiences and critics alike. Judd was also known for the 1975 \\"Think Once, Think Twice, Think Bike\\" campaign to make motorists aware of the risks faced on the road by motorcyclists. Judd's success in The Day the Earth Caught Fire saw Columbia Pictures sign him to a long term contract. According to Val Guest though, \\"he was such a pain in the ass to everybody. He had an enormous opinion of himself and he was his own worst enemy. Columbia just loaned him out here and there and then let him go.\\"Tom Weaver, \\"Val Guest\\", Double Feature Creature Attack: A Monster Merger of Two More Volumes of Classic Interviews McFarland, 2003 pp. 116‚Äì117 Judd appeared regularly on TV. In particular, he played the tyrannical uncle, William Russell, in the 1979 TV mini-series Flambards. He also appeared in The Sweeney and The Onedin Line in supporting roles. Very little is known of his life after the 1970s. He was heard in an episode of the BBC Radio comedy Drop Me Here, Darling, starring Leslie Phillips, in 1983, as well as playing Barrymore in a televised version of The Hound of the Baskervilles the same year, and the BBC Radio play Philadelphia Moonshine in 1985. He appeared in the 1988 TV film Jack the Ripper as Thomas Arnold. In the early 1970s, he lived in Cottenham Park Road, Wimbledon. During the 1970s and 1980s, Judd (known as Eddie to some friends, as evidenced in Michael Caine's 2011 autobiography) was a highly respected voice-over artist, used on many commercials recorded in the recording studios in London's Soho. As of 1990, he lived in the Phoenix Hotel in Wimbledon and was a credit officer for a Canadian investment bank. He lived at a retirement home in Mitcham in his last years. Personal life He was married twice; his first wife, who had also appeared in The Day the Earth Caught Fire, was actress Gene Anderson, who died in 1965. His second wife was actress Norma Ronald, with whom he had two daughters.Obituary \\"Edward Judd: actor in sci-fi films, the West End and TV series\\", The Times, 9 March 2009.

The Great Ejection followed the Act of Uniformity 1662 in England. Several thousand Puritan ministers were forced out of their positions in the Church of England, following The Restoration of Charles II. It was a consequence (not necessarily intended) of the Savoy Conference of 1661. History The Act of Uniformity prescribed that any minister who refused to conform to the Book of Common Prayer by St Bartholomew's Day (24 August) 1662 should be ejected from the Church of England. This date became known as 'Black Bartholomew's Day' among Dissenters, a reference to the fact that it occurred on the same day as the St Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572. Oliver Heywood estimated the number of ministers ejected at 2,500. This group included Richard Baxter, Edmund Calamy the Elder, Simeon Ashe, Thomas Case, John Flavel, William Jenkyn, Joseph Caryl, Thomas Brooks, Thomas Manton, William Sclater, Thomas Doolittle and Thomas Watson. Biographical details of ejected ministers and their fates were later collected by the historian Edmund Calamy, grandson of the elder Calamy. Although there had already been ministers outside the established church, the Great Ejection created an abiding concept of non-conformity. Strict religious tests of the Clarendon Code and other Penal Laws left a substantial section of English society excluded from public affairs, and also university degrees, for a century and a half. Culturally, in England and Wales, nonconformism endured longer than that. Historiography Memorial Hall on Albert Square, Manchester, built to commemorate the bicentennial of the Great Ejection, at the suggestion of John Relly Beard The bicentennial in 1862 led to a sharp debate, with the nonconformist agenda being questioned, and the account in Calamy being reviewed. Iain Murray argues that the issue was deeper than \\"phrases in the Book of Common Prayer and forms of church order,\\" but regarded the \\"nature of true Christianity.\\" Legacy The Bishop of Liverpool, J. C. Ryle (1816‚Äì1900), referred to the Ejection as an \\"injury to the cause of true religion in England which will probably never be repaired\\". A Service of Reconciliation was held at Westminster Abbey on 7 February 2012 to mark the 350th anniversary of the Great Ejection. Rowan Williams, then Archbishop of Canterbury, preached at the service which was attended by clergy and laity of the Church of England and the United Reformed Church.

After public concerns about the safety of bull bars led to governmental pressure on SUV and 4x4 vehicle manufacturers, the Transport Research Laboratory developed a series of tests designed to ensure that minimum safety standards are met on vehicles fitted with them. This test has now become embodied within European Directive 2005/66/EC, coming into force in May 2007. Effectively outlawing traditional metal fabricated bull bars, the new legislation has led to the development of more pedestrian-friendly products. Various manufacturers have undertaken development using softer, energy absorbing materials. However the overhead of testing has prevented many designs from coming to market. Naming The terminology \\"Frontal Protection System\\" derives from three terms: *Frontal, adj. Of, relating to, directed toward or situated at the front. *Protection, n. The action of protecting or the state of being protected, or a thing that protects. *System, n. A set of things working together as a mechanism or a network. Operation An FPS attaches to the front of a vehicle like a bull bar, but is made of a technical composite of energy-absorbing materials. The composite technology offers an interim solution to vehicle designers, assisting them to meet EC Directive 2003/102/EC Phase 2. Intrusion into base vehicle without an FPS: 200mm Intrusion into base vehicle with an FPS: 50-60mm Testing in 2001 showed that steel bull bars could lead to greater risk of injury. Later studies carried out by MIRA, one of the UK's leading testing-facilities, may have proved that the latest development of a vehicle Frontal Protection System can make many 4x4 vehicles safer in the event of front-end collisions with pedestrians or cyclists. Calculations based on these tests show that if fitted to a current large 4x4 vehicle, an FPS could save lives and reduce serious pedestrian-injuries. This legislation amounts to a de facto ban on Frontal Protection Systems, due to the high cost of compliance and type testing, and the sheer complexity of the law. The type testing procedure can be seen here. At least one small manufacturer of FPS has ceased production in the UK due to the costs of testing exceeding ¬£100,000 per design.

It consists of adding the letter p after each vowel of a word, and repeating the vowel. For example, Carlos turns into C√°par-lopos. For syllables with multiple vowels, usually only the stressed vowel is used. Australia becomes Apaus-trapa-liapa. Some people treat all vowels alike: they would say Apa-upus-trapa-lipi-apa. Yet another variant inserts the p+vowel at the end of all syllables instead of just after the vowel: Carlos does not become C√°par-lopos in this version, but Carpa-lospo. This language game is also known by alternate names in Spanish-speaking countries: jeringozo in Argentina and Uruguay, jerigonzo, jerigonza or jerigoncio in Chile and Colombia, and so on. In other countries it is called simply idioma de la pe (Spanish for P-language) and in Andaluc√≠a, \\"con la pe\\" (with the P). Most names derive from the Spanish word jerigonza, which can mean either jargon or gibberish. This game, with almost identical rules but using either the European Portuguese or the Brazilian Portuguese language, is popular with Portuguese and Brazilian children under the name of L√≠ngua do P√™ (Portuguese for P-language), but the word \\"geringon√ßa\\" means a complicated, fragile mechanical contraption.http://michaelis.uol.com.br/moderno/portugues/index.php?lingua=portugues- portugues&palavra;=geringon%E7a In other Spanish-speaking countries, similar games add other syllables instead of p+vowel. There are variants that use f instead of p; this is the case, for example, in Italian, where the game is called alfabeto farfallino, meaning \\"butterfly alphabet\\", because many modified words sound like farfalla (i.e., \\"butterfly\\"). Yet other variants add ti, cuti or chi before each syllable (thus giving ticar-til√≥s and ti√°us-titr√°- tili√° for the previous examples). In Spain, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, chi is used. An example would be: T√∫ est√°s enamorado(da) de mi (you are in love with me), which would be said: Chi-t√∫ chi-es chi-t√°s chi-e chi-na chi-mo chi-ra chi-do(da) chi-de chi-mi.

He was born in Yamachiche in Lower Canada in 1823. He studied at the S√©minaire de Nicolet, then articled in law with Antoine Polette and was called to the bar in 1844. Loranger first practiced at Trois-Rivi√®res, later joined the office of Lewis Thomas Drummond in Montreal and, in 1858, opened an office with his brothers Louis-On√©sime and Jean-Marie. He was named Queen's Counsel in 1854. Loranger was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Laprairie in 1854; he was reelected in 1857. He served on the Executive Council as secretary for Canada East. He opposed the idea of a double majority, where legislation must be approved by a majority of the representatives from both provinces, but believed that legislation affecting one province should be approved by a majority in that province. He supported Montreal as a capital and opposed the choice of Ottawa; this led to the resignation of the government of John A. Macdonald and George-√âtienne Cartier in 1858. Loranger continued as a member in the legislature until he was named judge in the Quebec Superior Court in 1863. In 1873, he published the first volume of Commentaire sur le Code civil du Bas-Canada, a discussion of the civil code of Quebec; a second volume was published in 1879 but the work was never completed. He also contributed articles to legal journals of the time. In 1877, he was named to head a commission to codify the general statutes of Quebec. Loranger retired in 1879 and became professor at the Universit√© Laval. In 1883 and 1884, he published a two volume work on the federal constitution. He died in Sainte-P√©tronille in 1885 and was buried in the C√¥te-des-Neiges cemetery in Montreal.

Its name is derived from the Polish word las (\\"forest\\").Heinrich Adamy, Die Schlesischen Ortsnamen ihre entstechung und bedeutung, 1888, p. 37 (in German) The town was part of the Duchy of Opole of fragmented Poland, and remained ruled by the Piast dynasty until 1532. The town was destroyed in 1429 during the Hussite Wars. In 1532 incorporated into the Bohemian Crown Lands, in 1645 it passed to the Poles again under the House of Vasa, and in 1666 it fell back to Bohemia. Under the Germanized name Leschnitz, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742 during the First Silesian War. The town was included in Landkreis Gro√ü Strehlitz within the Prussian Province of Silesia in 1816. Leschnitz became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany. During the Nazi campaign of renaming of placenames, in 1936 while part of the Province of Upper Silesia, it was renamed Bergstadt (\\"mountain town\\") to remove traces of Polish origin.

It called on well-known Christian thinkers and writers (its columnists include high-profile journalists, clergy and BBC comedy writers) to comment on news issues, much as the New Statesman or Spectator calls on those from left or right. According to the Times, it was 'noted for giving a serious Christian perspective on topics ranging from the Bible to politics, environment to the arts'. The magazine was not affiliated with either the minor British political party Third Way, or with the centrist 'Third Way' policies of Tony Blair and Bill Clinton. In 1974, thousands of Christians meeting at the First International Congress on World Evangelization held in Lausanne, Switzerland signed a covenant pledging to commit themselves to bringing the Christian gospel to bear on social issues. This sparked a lively debate in the Christian monthly magazine Crusade between David Sheppard, later Bishop of Liverpool, and John Pridmore. The debate inspired the editor of Crusade, John Capon, to launch Third Way as a fortnightly magazine in January 1977, putting a Christian perspective on current affairs and the arts. Its title refers to an observation by the theologian Os Guinness in his 1973 book The Dust of Death: 'How often in the contemporary discussion a sensitive modern man knows that he cannot accept either of the polarised alternatives offered to him. In Christianity, however, there can be a Third Way, a true middle ground which has a basis, is never compromise and is far from silent.' Third Way's first editor was Derek Williams. In 1978, he was succeeded by Alex Beale, later Alex Mitchell, who moved the magazine to its current monthly publication schedule. Third Way reviewed films, music, books and television. It also carried features on social or cultural issues (such as the environment, sexual identity and economics) as well as in-depth interviews of high-profile and influential people, which are published in question-and- answer format without editorial comment. Since 1993, it has talked to Marina Abramoviƒá, Gerry Adams, Maya Angelou, Tony Blair, Richard Branson, Noam Chomsky, Paulo Coelho, Richard Dawkins, Tracey Emin, Werner Herzog, Annie Lennox, Theresa May, Khalid Mish'al, J√ºrgen Moltmann, Camille Paglia, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, Anita Roddick and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek among over 200 others. The Observer has said that 'the magazine has clearly ‚Ä¶ mastered the art of interviewing celebs who have been stitched up once too often by the red-tops'. The magazine had 10,000 readers worldwide. Its last editor was Simon Jones and other staff included Steve Tomkins, Nick Thorpe and Huw Spanner. In terms of Christian alignment, it sat comfortably alongside the Greenbelt festival or the website Ship of Fools. In July 2007 Third Way was acquired by Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd, which also owns the Church Times. The closure of the magazine was announced in February 2016, with effect from the April 2016 issue.https://thirdway.hymnsam.co.uk/ References External linksThird Way magazine back issues on Google Books Category:1977 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2016 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Biweekly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Religious magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Christian magazines Category:Defunct magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 1977 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2016 ","title":"Third Way (magazine)"},{"id":"5998250","text":"Sir William Ramsay (1852-1916) was a Scottish chemist who discovered the noble gases.

It has sold over 5 million copies, and has been translated into ten languages. Family, early life, and education Hugh Prather's father, Hugh Prather, Jr., grandfather, Hugh Prather, Sr., and great grandfather John S. Armstrong, contributed to the growth of the city of Dallas, Texas. With his father-in-law John S. Armstrong and Armstrong's other son-in-law Edgar Flippen, Prather, Sr., helped plan and build the town of Highland Park, which is now part of the enclave Park Cites surrounded by the city of Dallas. In 1931, Armstrong and his two sons-in-law built Highland Park Village, the first planned shopping center in the United States. Hugh Prather, Jr., ran the shopping center after his father's death. Hugh Prather III was born in Dallas and earned a bachelor's degree at Southern Methodist University in 1966 after study at Principia College and Columbia University. He studied at the University of Texas at the graduate level without taking a degree. Career While he could be categorized as a New Age writer, Prather drew on Christian language and themes and seemed comfortable conceiving of God in personal terms. His work underscored the importance of gentleness, forgiveness, and loyalty; declined to endorse dramatic claims about the power of the individual mind to effect unilateral transformations of external material circumstances; and stressed the need for the mind to let go of destructive cognitions in a manner not unlike that encouraged by the cognitive-behavioral therapy of Aaron T. Beck and the rational emotive behavior therapy commended by Albert Ellis. His first book, Notes to Myself: My Struggle to Become a Person, began as a journal that he impulsively submitted to a publisher. The book became \\"a phenomenon\\" of the 1970s, according to The New York Times, and as of 2010 it remained in print. Prather's dog Moosewood was named in the book and inspired the name of the Moosewood Restaurant. The book was later parodied by humorist Jack Handey with his \\"Deep Thoughts\\". Together with his second wife, Gayle Prather, whom he married in 1965, he wrote The Little Book of Letting Go, I Touch the Earth, The Earth Touches Me, How to Live in the World and Still Be Happy, I Will Never Leave You: How Couples Can Achieve The Power Of Lasting Love, Spiritual Notes to Myself: Essential Wisdom for the 21st Century, Shining Through: Switch on Your Life and Ground Yourself in Happiness, Spiritual Parenting: A Guide to Understanding and Nurturing the Heart of Your Child, Standing on My Head: Life Lessons in Contradictions, A Book of Games: A Course in Spiritual Play, Love and Courage, Notes to Each Other, A Book for Couples, The Quiet Answer, and There is a Place Where You Are Not Alone. In 2018, a librarian in Cincinnati, Ohio, Sheryl Pockrose, discovered that master cassettes of three years of Prather's lectures from the Dispensable Church in Santa Fe, given 1981-1983, still existed, and had been saved for many years by one of the original deacons of the church, Jonathan Huntress. With the approval of Gayle Prather, these talks are being digitized by Stellar Platforms and made available for free listening at https://dispensablechurch.wordpress.com/ Death Prather died on November 15, 2010, in the hot tub of his Tucson, Arizona home, apparently of a heart attack. He is survived by his immediate family - wife Gayle Prather, and their two sons, John and Jordan - and his siblings Alan A. Prather, Joan Prather, and Jeffrey P. Prather. .

History The first school taught in the town section of Anson was opened in April 1882 and closed in July of the same year. It was taught at the home of R. M. Huie which was located near the First Baptist Church. The next school was taught by and in the home of E. G. Jones, with the assistance of his wife (in 1956, the Johnny Moore Magnolia Station was located in the same place). The first school building was built on Block 55, Lot 4 (in 1933 it was owned by Joe Grace Estate). The decision to build the school was made at a mass meeting at the Buie Law office in 1883. They raised enough money by public subscription to build one room. The Masonic Lodge agreed to build a room for their own use, to cover the building, and to furnish the lot. The school was built by volunteer labor and was taught by E.G. Jones. In 1889, a larger building was needed. $5,000 dollars was paid by the taxpayers and used to build this building. This was the building where the first graduating class was taught. They were graduated in 1897; the class consisting of Lola Hale, Allie Maxwell, Lelia Morris, Effie Neville, and Nannie Thompkins, and the principal was C. E. Evans. This school building was sold in 1904 and moved to become the Ansford Hotel. It stood until it burned down in 1943. A new, two- story brick school was built and used for all grades until 1910. Then a new high school building was erected south of the square. In 1929, the original unit of Ward School was constructed. In 1948 a $250,000 school bond was passed to build a new elementary school and remodel the existing high school. Finally, in 1968, the present high school was built. The Texas author Lou Halsell Rodenberger (1926‚Äì2009) graduated as the valedictorian of Anson High School at the age of sixteen in 1942.

Founded in 1946 as a women's association, it runs an annual state championship and state league, and attends all ASF National Championships. Brief history Softball was played in Brisbane in 1945 at Victoria Park by a group of enthusiastic \\"youngsters\\" who had either learnt to play softball at the Bedford Playground in Spring Hill or from the American troops who were camped in the grounds of the Hendra School. Two of the \\"youngsters\\" shared their enthusiasm for their new sport with an acquaintance, an American named Mack Gilley, who had also been involved in the softball competition played by the American troops stationed in Brisbane. Mack Gilley was soon umpiring their games at Victoria Park. In 1946 the Queensland Women's Softball Association was formed with Mack Gilley its President and Mrs Gough, the Secretary/Treasurer. Through his association with the Queensland Baseball Association, Mack Gilley subsequently negotiated to have a softball competition at Perry Park in the summer months while baseball was in recess. Five teams, Laurel White, Laurel Green, Carlton 1 and Carlton 2 and Checkers played in the metropolitan competition. In 1947 the first Australian Women's Championship was held in Brisbane with players and officials from the metropolitan competition representing Queensland at the Championship. The following years would see several players and officials from the metropolitan competition represent Queensland at Australian Women's Championships with the exception of 1948 when there was no Australian Championship and 1952 and 1957 when a Queensland team did not compete. In 1949 the first Australian Women's Team played New Zealand in Melbourne with players and an official from the metropolitan competition representing Australia in the international tournament. The following years would also see several players and officials from the metropolitan competition go on to represent Australia at international tournaments. Softball numbers increased, games were played at wherever a ground could be found, the competition was administered by the Metropolitan Delegates and Executive Committees of the Queensland Women's Softball Association and in January 1953 the first Intercity Carnival was held in Brisbane, with four teams competing in the Carnival, Brisbane, Ipswich, Maryborough and Townsville. 1954 saw the Intercity Carnival held again in Brisbane with six teams competing, two from Brisbane, Ipswich, Toowoomba, Townsville and Lismore. Two Brisbane teams competed in the Intercity Carnival in Maryborough in 1955 and in Townsville in 1956. Three representative teams (two senior teams and a junior team) competed in the Intercity Carnival in Toowoomba in 1957 and in Cairns in 1958. In 1959 the Intercity Carnival became known as the State Carnival and again three Brisbane representative teams competed in the Carnival in Brisbane. The following years saw softball continue to grow and the metropolitan competition continue to be administered by the Metropolitan Delegates and Executive Committees of the Queensland Women's Softball Association.

He is known only through the work of Herodotus (Histories, V.104‚Äì115). Background Cyprus was a part of the Persian Empire, but, when the Ionians rebelled from Persian rule, Onesilus captured the city of Salamis and usurped his brother‚Äôs throne. He was able to win over every city on the island except for the Graeco-Phoenician city-state of Amathus, which stayed loyal to the Persians despite being besieged by Onesilus' troops. In 497 BC, the Persians mounted an attack on Cyprus with the help of the Phoenician navy. Some of the Ionian colonies sent ships to assist Onesilus, and in the ensuing battle they were able to defeat the Phoenician navy. Onesilus then led an army against the Persian general, Artybius. Although Artybius himself died in the battle, the Persians were victorious and Onesilus was also killed. As a result, the Ionian fleet retreated from Cyprus and five months later the Persians regained control of the island. Onesilus‚Äô brother, Gorgus Chersides, was then reinstated by the Persians as king of Salamis. Herodotus also reports that in retaliation for Onesilus' siege of Amathus, the townspeople cut off his head after his death and hung it above the town gates as a trophy, and later observed that his desiccated skull had been occupied by a swarm of bees and their honeycomb (a phenomenon similar to bugonia). To ward off the effects of this ill omen they were advised to take down the head and bury it, making sacrifice to Onesilus as a hero. In popular culture The story of the bees in the skull is the subject of \\"histories: onesilos\\", a poem by German poet Jan Wagner.

The district serves a area that covers most of Aransas County, including the city of Rockport, the town of Fulton, and the unincorporated communities of Holiday Beach and Lamar. History The first public school in Aransas County was instituted in 1884 where the Rockport city water tower once stood. In 1886 a one-room school house was built in Fulton. A one-room school at Sparks Colony followed. The school met in various places and land was sought for the location of a permanent building to house the school. The land was purchased and the building completed in 1892. It was constructed at the site of present-day Rockport Elementary. On May 17, 1907, four girls and two boys graduated from the Rockport High School in a ceremony held at the Bailey Pavilion, built over the water across from where the Wells Fargo Bank now stands. It was the first graduating class in the history of the school. Between 1893 and 1949, seven Common School Districts were in existence in the county. In June 1949, these districts voted to consolidate and became the Aransas County Independent School District. In 1935 Rockport School was erected, now known as Rockport Elementary. In 1953, a new high school was opened at its present location on a site between Fulton and Rockport. In 1957 Fulton Elementary School opened; and in 1988 an additional building on the south side of the existing campus was completed. In September 1963, classes were opened in the new Junior High; and in September, 1967, the Live Oak Elementary School was opened. The most recent construction was Rockport-Fulton Middle School and renovations to Rockport- Fulton High School connecting the high school to the old Jr. High, creating a larger campus to service the High School students of Aransas County.ACISD History ‚Äì Aransas County Independent School District.
