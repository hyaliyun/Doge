He signed his work as C.C. Dommershuizen, Chr. Dommelshuizen, Christian Dommelshuizen and C. Dommersen. Dommersen at the website of the RKD Family The spelling of the Dutch family name is rather complicated as it is spelled in many different ways such as Dommelshuizen, Dommershuizen, Dommershuyzen, Dommershuijzen, Dommerson, with occasionally the Dutch prefix 'van'. Pre 1700 the family came from Dahlheim, near Koblenz, in Germany, so their family name was originally 'Dommershausen'. Although the paintings are usually signed as Dommersen. Cornelis Christiaan's older brother was Pieter Cornelis Dommersen (1833-1918), who was also born in Utrecht. Pieter Cornelis was a painter as well, gaining more fame than his younger brother. Both were illegitimate sons of Cornelia Dommershuitzen . In around 1850 Pieter Cornelis Dommersen moved to England and stayed there till his death in Hexham in 1918. Pieter Cornelis Dommersen had a son called William Raymond Dommersen (1859-1927), who also became a painter in England. Cornelis Christiaan specialized just like his brother in sea -and river scapes and coastal scenery as those paintings had found a revival during the 19th century in Europe. He traveled abroad to countries such as England, America, Belgium and France, just like his countryman Abraham Hulk Senior did. However, in the end he found satisfaction painting not only river- and seascapes in the Netherlands but also the interior of villages and towns along the rivers. On his travels, he was often accompanied by his brother and his nephew. He wappears to have been married twice without issue. He married twice, first in The Hague Henriette Johanna Philippo, who was born c. 1852 in Amsterdam. He married 2nd in The Hague 26 May 1904 Carolina Maria Fredrica de Geus, who was born in Houtrijk en Polanen on 24 April 1852. Both marriages seem to have been childless.

Painted decotation in the Long Corridor at the Summer Palace in Beijing, China The White Dragon Horse, known as Bai Longma () in Chinese, is one of the main characters in the 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West. He is Tang Sanzang's steed who later became Babu Tianlong Guangli Bodhisattva (ÂÖ´ÈÉ®Â§©ÈæôÂπøÂäõËè©Ëê®) at the end of novel. Journey to the West In Journey to the West, Bai Longma is actually a dragon prince Ao Lie who is the third son of the Dragon King of the West Sea. He once set a fire that destroyed a pearl that was a gift from the Jade Emperor. He was about to be executed for committing this offense when Guanyin appeared and pleaded for his life. The dragon prince was spared from death and banished to Yingchou Stream (È∑πÊÑÅÊæó) in Shepan Mountain (ËõáÁõ§Â±±). When Tang Sanzang is crossing the stream, the prince appears in the form of a gigantic white dragon and swallows Tang's white horse in one gulp. The dragon then fights with Sun Wukong but is no match and retreats underwater. Sun Wukong hears from an Earth Deity that the dragon was placed there by Guanyin so he goes to find the bodhisattva and learns of the dragon's origin. The dragon prince had been waiting there for Tang Sanzang but did not recognise the latter and ate his horse as a result. The dragon then transforms into the White Dragon Horse and serves as Tang Sanzang's steed for the rest of the latter's journey. When Tang Sanzang was captured by the Yellow Robe Demon, the White Dragon Horse transforms himself a young man and attempts to save Tang Sanzang, but fails and he escapes to inform Zhu Bajie, who in turn brings back Sun Wukong to save Tang Sanzang. At the end of the novel, the White Dragon Horse is ordained as the Great Strength Bodhisattva of the Eight Heavenly Sections (ÂÖ´ÈÉ®Â§©ÈæôÂπøÂäõËè©Ëê®) and Dragon Horse of the Eight Heavenly Sections (ÂÖ´ÈÉ®Â§©ÈæçÈ¶¨). He turns into a white dragon and wraps his body around one of the pillars in the Great Leiyin Temple.

Adaptations of Journey to the West * In the 1986 television series, the White Dragon Horse was getting married when his fianc√©e, the Wansheng Princess, was cheating on him. He got so angry that he burned the pearl given to him as a gift by the Jade Emperor and was banished to Yingchou Stream as punishment. Sometime after being punished, the White Dragon Horse ate Tang Sanzang's horse when the horse ran off. When Sun Wukong saw that the horse was missing, he fought the dragon prince demanding his master's horse back. After fighting with the prince, Wukong went to the Dragon King's palace to discuss the dragon he had fought. When Guanyin appeared, Sun Wukong told her about the dragon that ate his master's horse. Guanyin called the prince out and instructed him to be Tang Sanzang's steed for the rest of the journey. * In the anime and manga Saiyuki, the character of Jeep is loosely based on the White Dragon Horse. He is a small shapeshifting dragon that transforms into the Sanzo party's mode of transportation on their journey: a Jeep (hence the name). He is Hakkai's pet and can breathe fire. In his past life, instead of being a son of the Dragon King of the West (Sea), he was the Dragon King himself, named Goujun. He was also a commanding officer of Heaven's army and Kenren Taisho's immediate superior.

Irvine became the then-oldest person to participate in the United States Olympic Trials in track and field in 1984, when she was 54 years old. Following the Trials, she regularly ran on the marathon circuit and gained attention from the media, along with the nickname \\"The Flying Nun\\". Irvine broke numerous age-group records in distance running events during her career, and has been inducted into multiple running halls of fame. Early life and work career Irvine was born in San Francisco, California. At St. Rose Academy, she became interested in becoming a nun; in 2007, Irvine said that she \\"fell in love with the life\\" at St. Rose. Under the name Sister Bonaventure, Irvine became a nun in the Dominican Order. At Dominican College, she received a biology degree; afterward she became a high school teacher. Irvine spent more than 20 years as a teacher and school administrator in California, and worked for the Dominican Sisters in the role of supervisor of the organization's schools for six years. Running career Prior to the time that she started to run, Irvine did not regularly exercise. After a brief period in which she took up swimming, Irvine began jogging in 1978. She did so on the recommendation of a niece, who was concerned about Irvine's condition physically. While on a religious retreat, Irvine ran for the first time, and was quickly able to cover a distance of two miles in a session.Lin and Warner, chapter 2, pp. 1‚Äì2. Her initial strategy was to alternate between walking and running, depending on the availability of shade. Within four months of starting to run, she was posting times of seven minutes per mile in her two- mile runs, and soon she started entering five-kilometer and 10-kilometer races.Lin and Warner, chapter 2, pp. 2‚Äì3. Irvine's first race at a longer distance was a 15-kilometer run at a park; she posted the second-fastest time among the women who took part. In 1980, she joined her niece in running at the Avenue of the Giants Marathon, posting a time of 3:01. Irvine then started to regularly take part in marathons, at the rate of four per year. In addition, she hired a coach in 1982.Lin and Warner, chapter 2, p. 3. In the previous year, Irvine had run in the Boston Marathon, winning the women's 50‚Äì59 age group in a time of 3:11.00. Many records for female runners over 50 years old were set by Irvine. She was the first woman in her age group to run for under 20 minutes in the 5-kilometer run, 38 minutes in the 10-km, and 3:00 in the marathon. In 1983, Irvine competed in the California International Marathon, held in Sacramento, California. Her time of 2:51.01 set a world record for female runners over 50; it was over eight seconds faster than the previous record time, which she held, and about 13 minutes ahead of the next-fastest time by an over-50 woman. The time also bettered the 2:51.16 that was required to participate in the United States Olympic Trials. At the time, Irvine was the oldest competitor ever in a U.S. track and field Olympic Trials; by the time of the Trials, she was 54 years old. In the 1984 Trials, which qualified runners for the inaugural Olympic women's marathon, Irvine posted a time of 2:52.02, and was not one of the qualifiers.Lin and Warner, chapter 2, p. 4. Of the 268 women who ran at the Trials, she ended up in 131st place. Regarding the experience, Irvine said, \\"I knew the trials would be my Olympics.\\" Nicknamed \\"The Flying Nun\\", Irvine gained recognition from her U.S. Olympic Trials run. She made appearances on the television programs Good Morning America, The Phil Donahue Show, and Today, and received profiles from major American magazines. Irvine continued her running career and gained a sponsorship from Nike, Inc.. With her travel costs covered by Nike, she entered marathons in Europe as well as the U.S., and occasionally took part in track events.Lin and Warner, chapter 2, pp. 4‚Äì5. In one event held in Europe, the 1985 World Veterans Games in Rome, Italy, Irvine earned four medals: one gold and three silver. As Irvine grew older, she broke further age-group records for 55‚Äì59- and 60‚Äì64-year-old female runners. At the 1989 World Veterans Games, she won five gold medals. In the fall of 1989, Irvine broke her right leg while training, forcing her into an extended break from running. In 1993, Irvine ran her final competitive race. She ran in a half marathon, but her time of 1:59.53 was approximately half an hour slower than she anticipated. Following the race, she retired from competition. Although Irvine no longer ran a competitive schedule, she continued to train for running, at a reduced rate, and took up other sports, including rowing. She often rowed indoors with an ergometer. Irvine spent the years after the end of her running career campaigning for social issues, and credited her attendance at the 1999 World Trade Organization protests as the driving factor behind her involvement. She has been a critic of the death penalty, globalization, and the Iraq War. Legacy During her career, Irvine was recognized as the leading runner in her age group eight times between 1981 and 1992. Irvine gained induction into the Road Runners Club of America Hall of Fame in 1994. In addition, she is in the USATF Masters Hall of Fame. Irvine is featured in the 1987 Oscar-nominated documentary film, Silver into Gold.Bergquist, p. 145.

Biography  Passafire was created in 2003 by students attending Savannah College of Art and Design. Since then the band has been regularly touring, playing shows with bands such as 311 (on the 311 Cruise in May 2012), Pepper (playing on the LAW Records Tour in October 2008), Rebelution, Matisyahu, Michael Franti and The Wailers. They also toured with Slightly Stoopid at the end of December, 2013.Passafire with a fan on the 311 Cruise in 2012 Passafire's third album, Everyone on Everynight, was released on the band Pepper's recording label, LAW Records. Their fourth album, Start From Scratch, produced by Paul Leary, debuted in the fall of 2011 and reached number one on the Billboard Top Reggae Albums chart. Start from Scratch marked the departure of original keyboardist Adam Willis from the band in 2010. It was the first album to feature Mike DeGuzman on the keys, who was discovered after playing with The Expendables in Chicago during the 2010 Winter Blackout Tour. Adam Willis left the band for personal reasons after the decision to not continue touring and parted ways with Passafire amicably. Passafire at The Cali Roots Festival: Carolina Sessions in 2013 In 2013, Easy Star Records signed Passafire and welcomed them to the Easy Star family. Passafire's fifth album, Vines, debuted in the fall of 2013 at number one on the Billboard Top Reggae Albums chart. This came after working again with Paul Leary, who also worked alongside Sublime, Pepper, U2, Slightly Stoopid, and several other successful groups. On May 12, 2017 the band released the album Longshot.Passafire performing at the Constellation Room in Santa Ana, CA on January 28, 2014  Musical Style  While earlier work mostly fits within the reggae-rock genre, the band's sound has taken on many forms since their self-titled release. Elements such as intricate lead guitar and unexpected instrumental breakdowns are reminiscent of progressive rock. This and other alternative influences are evident as early as their 2007 release, Submersible. In 2011, Start from Scratch explored more organic textures that touched on folk rock. The use of banjos, mandolins, acoustic guitar, and melodica (most notably on the album's title track, performed by new member Mike DeGuzman) were a temporary shift in sound that would influence later releases.

On 4 January, a tropical low pressure developed within a monsoon trough over the Timor Sea. Over the following several days, the system gradually tracked westward and intensified, being classified Tropical Cyclone Narelle on 8 January. Turning southward into a region of low wind shear, Narelle intensified into a severe tropical cyclone on 9 January. Over the following two days, the cyclone's structure fluctuated, temporarily featuring an eye, before it maintained its organisation and intensified further on 11 January. The storm attained its peak intensity later on 11 January as a Category 4 cyclone with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). The following day, Narelle passed approximately northwest of Exmouth as it moved on a south-southwesterly course. The system steadily weakened and ultimately fell below tropical cyclone strength on 15 January well to the west of Geraldton. Early in the storm's existence, Narelle brought strong winds, heavy rain, and high winds to many areas in Indonesia. More than 10,000 homes were flooded and many others were damaged by thunderstorms. A total of 14 people were killed by the storm, and 17 others were listed as missing. In Western Australia, scattered strong thunderstorms caused minor damage and produced a possible tornado.

The following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the system for possible development into a tropical cyclone. Traveling westward, the system was forecast to intensify as it moved into an area highly favouring tropical cyclogenesis with very warm waters (with sea surface temperatures of ) and low wind shear. Additionally, a nearby anticyclone provided good outflow for the system. Over the following two days, deep convection gradually built around the low and on 7 January, the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Darwin designated the system as Tropical Low 05U, at which time the storm was situated roughly south-southeast of Sumba, Indonesia. By this time, the system was tracking west-southwestward around a subtropical ridge, which would dictate the track of the storm for the remainder of its existence. Later on 7 January, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system, indicating that further development of the low into a significant tropical cyclone was anticipated. Just seven hours after this, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm and began issuing advisories. Through the morning of 8 January, weak wind shear hindered development of the system. After enough convection wrapped around the centre of circulation, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology classified the low as Tropical Cyclone Narelle, the second named storm in the western region during the 2012‚Äì13 season. Shortly thereafter, intensification quickened as a central dense overcast formed and prominent banding features consolidated. Following the development of an eye early on 9 January, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded Narelle to a severe tropical cyclone, with winds estimated at 120 km/h (75 mph). Over the following day, Narelle's intensity levelled out as it encountered moderate wind shear. Once the shear relaxed, the system resumed strengthening. With conditions more favourable, Narelle redeveloped an eye and its outflow improved. Late on 11 January, Narelle is estimated to have attained its peak intensity with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg). Operationally, the storm was believed to have been slightly stronger, peaking as a Category 5 cyclone on the Australian scale. It was not until a post-storm assessment that the Bureau of Meteorology found Narelle to have been a weaker system at its peak. At the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph), ranking it as a Category 4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale. Hours after Narelle reached peak intensity, increasing wind shear caused the storm's eyewall to erode and the outflow to become somewhat restricted. By the afternoon of 12 January, the storm's structure had significantly degraded, with the eye no longer apparent and a marked decrease in cold cloud tops. Later that day, the cyclone made its closest approach to Western Australia, passing approximately northwest of Exmouth. Despite shear eventually lightening up, the storm's southerly course brought it over cooler waters, preventing restrengthening. Most of the deep convection shifted to the western side of Narelle's circulation, though its centre remained well defined. By the evening of 13 January, the storm had weakened below severe tropical cyclone strength. Rapid weakening ensued on 14 January, as the effects of cooler waters and dry air caused the deep convection to dissociate into an area of shallow stratocumulus clouds. Narelle failed to redevelop deep convection and weakened below tropical cyclone status early on 15 January, prompting the Bureau of Meteorology to issue its final bulletin on the cyclone. The system was last observed about west of Geraldton, where it continued southward away from Australia. Preparations and impact=Indonesia= On 9 January, the MV Emeline cargo vessel sank off the coast of Selayar Islands. Of the 17 crewmen, 6 were rescued and 11 others remained missing as of 16 January. Another vessel, the MV Angle, became stranded near West Lombok Regency. By 10 January, Narelle brought strong winds, heavy rains, and rough seas to the province of Bali in Indonesia. Residents and tourists were warned of waves up to . Ferry service between Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, and Java was suspended, isolating residents in Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. Winds from the storm downed many trees and caused severe damage to structures across Bali, especially in the capital city of Denpasar. In Selemadeg Village, one person died after a tree fell on her. Trees and billboards were downed across Jakarta, and three homes were damaged. Flooding in the region closed several roads, leading to traffic delays more than long. In Banten, heavy rains caused four major rivers in the province to overflow their banks, leading to flooding in 33 districts. A total of 10,470 homes across the province were inundated, and four people were killed. In all, 14 people were killed and 6 others were listed as missing. =Western Australia= Narelle as a weakening tropical cyclone off the Western Australian coast on 12 January After Narelle moved into TCWC Perth's area of responsibility on 9 January, a cyclone watch was issued for areas between Whim Creek and Coral Bay. A blue alert, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) lowest level of readiness, was also issued for areas between Mardie and Whim Creek. The following day, the watch was upgraded to a cyclone warning for all areas and a new watch was issued to the west, encompassing areas as far as Cape Cuvier. The watch was further extended early on 11 January to include areas between Cape Cuvier and Carnarvon. As the storm continued on a more westward path than initially anticipated, the warning area was gradually decreased, with areas east of Roebourne receiving the all clear later on 11 January. The watch area, however, continued to expand and encompassed areas as far east as Denham. As the storm made its closet approach to Western Australia on 13 January, the watches and warnings area were gradually discontinued, with all advisories being discontinued that afternoon. By 11 January, the Apache Corporation began evacuating all non-essential personnel from oil rigs in the path of the storm. The Rio Tinto Group shut down iron exports at its Dampier and Cape Lambert ports due to rough seas. Across the Pilbara region, the State Emergency Service advised residents to secure loose objects and ensure their emergency kits were stocked. Incident management teams were also established to help people in the wake of the storm. Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha. Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at-risk areas in Narelle's path to speed up power restoration in the wake of the storm. In Carnarvon, mango producers picked as much of their fruit as possible before the storm arrived to minimise losses. Along the coast of Western Australia, between Onslow and Busselton, minor storm tides were reported, with a peak rise of in Onslow. This caused flooding in low-lying areas, though no damage was reported in relation to it. In North West Australia, especially around Exmouth, the storm brought gusty winds that downed a few trees and produced as much as of rain. Between 15 and 16 January, the remnants of the storm brought widespread moisture to southern areas of Western Australia, especially the wheatbelt region, leading to scattered showers and thunderstorms. A total of of rain fell in Ravensthorpe, with falling in a ten-minute span. A strong storm in Karlgarin produced winds up to that tore the roofs off eight buildings. Losses in the town exceeded A$70,000 (US$74,000). Winds in Lake Grace gusted up to . According to Horizon Power, there was no loss of electricity across Western Australia. A potential tornado touched down near Capel, downing trees along a wide swath. In Perth, the storm brought unusually warm, moist air, keeping temperatures from dropping below , making it the warmest January night in 24 years. =Elsewhere= While still off the coast of Western Australia, moisture from Narelle brought scattered rains to South Australia. The heaviest totals were measured in Lameroo at . In many areas, this ended a 28‚Äëday dry spell and brought relief amid a severe heat wave. Grape growers in Adelaide Hills also benefited from the rain and cooler temperatures. On 18 January, a French sailor had to abandon his yacht off the coast of Tasmania after its mast broke due to rough weather caused by the remnants of Narelle.

Its pharmacology is similar to the stimulant desoxypipradrol in which the pyridine ring is reduced to a piperidine and for which it is a chemical precursor.  Preparation  Diphenyl-2-pyridylmethane was prepared by researchers at Ciba Pharmaceuticals (now Novartis) as the immediate precursor of desoxypipradrol, when they patented the latter as a psychomotor stimulant or narcoleptic. Diphenyl acetonitrile was reacted with 2-bromopyridine, using sodamide as base and the resulting diphenyl-2-pyridylacetonitrile was hydrolysed and decarboxylated using potassium hydroxide in methanol.  Uses  Diphenyl-2-pyridylmethane behaves in coordination complexes with metal cations in the same way as pyridine, with the aromatic nitrogen potentially forming a bond to the metal. In this case, the bulky and lipophilic diphenylmethyl substituent means that the resulting complex may be appreciably soluble in organic solvents like chloroform and benzene. This ability to transfer metal cations from water into non-miscible solvents has been exploited to extract thiocyanate complexes for example of silver, gold, cobalt and zinc; in some cases in the presence of other metals which were retained in the aqueous phase.  Pharmacology  Pipradol and desoxypipradrol are norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors that were not in practice widely used as drugs owing to their perceived potential for abuse. Although diphenyl-2-pyridylmethane is less potent than these molecules and its 4-pyridyl equivalent it was nevertheless specifically included when the UK ACMD advised that this group of drugs be controlled as Class B.

Takembeng or Takumbeng are a female social movement in the Northwest Region of Cameroon. These movements connect with traditional practices common throughout the Western grassfields of Cameroon where groups of women perform ostracizing rituals against individuals in their communities. Toward the end of colonial control and in the early years of independent Cameroon (the 1950s and 1960s), these local practices became a crucial tool for larger political protest, often against agricultural policy. With political liberalization in the 1990s, the Takembeng women became a crucial part of opposition to the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) party. The women marched with the Social Democratic Front (SDF) and would use nudity and the social status of older women to prevent troops and security forces from harassing protesters. The Takembeng practices often involve groups of thirty to a couple of hundred women participating in wider protests in Bamenda (the Northwest Region capital), but separated from other protesters by large spaces. Nudity, public defecation and urination are used, in connection with the precolonial practices, to emphasize the shame of anti-democratic practices and to prevent disruption by police or security forces. These practices have been very effective in providing room for protests and continue to be used in the Northwest Region. Name origin Takembeng is referred to in a variety of different ways, including: Takumbeng, Amazons, les Amazones des SDF, and Mami Takembeng. However, Takembeng is the most common spelling and rendering in the English language newspapers of Cameroon. The name is claimed to derive from a society of princes in the precolonial Bafut tribal area. Roots Divisions of Northwest Cameroon. Takembeng mobilizations are the latest in a long history of female mobilizations in the Western grassfields of Cameroon. Sociologist Susan Diduk divides these mobilizations into three different periods (with prior forms continuing to exist in later periods). The first period of women exercising moral guardianship involved women in rural communities mobilizing to shame individuals who violated key community moral standards. A second period involved women from multiple communities connecting with one another to protest colonial and post-independence policies, primarily agricultural, from the 1950s on. Takembeng is the name for mobilizations which begun in the early 1990s and often took place with the opposition party to the government, the Social Democratic Front (SDF). Some sources claim that Takembeng is a long-standing practice in Ngemba communities and that it does not grow from the practices in the various communities. =Moral guardianship= Throughout many communities in the grassfields of Cameroon (much of the present-day Northewest Region), there are longstanding practices of women gathering together as moral guardians of the community and in shaming individuals who break key rules. In addition women provide key ceremonial functions in many of the rural communities throughout the region: namely in protecting agricultural fertility. The moral guardianship gatherings would often use outlandish behavior in the ostracizing of individuals in order to highlight the severity of the offense and to prevent other people from intervening in the punishment. The practices differed in the various communities and are called fombuen or keluh in Kedjom Keku communities, anlu in Kom communities, and ndofoumbgui in the Aghem tribe. In general these gatherings would involve older women, usually post-menopausal, gathering together in order to punish individuals of the community for offense such as being accused of witchcraft, falsely accusing others of witchcraft, physically abusing family members or pregnant women, incest, or committing other offenses. In the precolonial situation, these practices were very local, never extended outside of a single ethnic community, and established clear remedies for the individuals targeted (typically begging for forgiveness from the women, paying a fine, and being ritually cleansed). The older women gather at the house of the individual being targeted, sing and chant, and behave in ways which are typically against decorum (including stripping, defecating and urinating on the person‚Äôs property, sexual harassment and puns directed at passersby, dressing in male attire, etc.) in order to express the severity of the offense. In Kedjom Keku communities, the women would be led by comedians (called vugweys) who would lead the group in making vulgar jokes and puns at those passing by and the individual being shamed. In Kom communities, the women would be led by the oldest women in the community, called na-anlu (mother of anlu) for the duration of the shaming, who was in charge of organizing the various efforts. Dress was an important feature in these events and the women dressed often in old clothing or rags with hats (increasingly backwards baseball caps in Kedjom Keku) and would be adorned with plants which are claimed to provide protection to the women. Men largely avoid the demonstrations and run away from the protests to avoid the women acting in offensive ways. There are rumors that seeing the women can drain a person‚Äôs vital force and this keeps men from intervening in the practice at all. These local, rural practices are considered crucial aspect of upholding the morality of the communities and provide women with a unique aspect of power in the affairs of the community. =Development as political protest= During colonial rule, these local gatherings were transformed into a more political practice which would be targeted against political institutions. They would include multiple communities, although still remaining closely related to specific ethnic groups, and would be aligned with political parties. During this period, key issues for mobilization included threats to female land tenure, rumors of the sale of land to different ethnic groups, crop destruction caused by grazing animals which had increased in the grasslands, and disputes over the required use of new agricultural techniques (namely, contour cultivation). The traditional tools of shaming and ostracizing individuals grew to target and be organized against colonial authorities and specific political parties using protests, disruptions in public spaces, roadblocks, and other nonviolent means. The most significant example is the 1958-1961 political anlu in the Kom communities. The event started on 4 July 1958 in the town of Njinikom when women who were upset about agricultural policy decisions surrounded the location of a meeting and forced the local council member C.K. Batholomew to flee to the local church for protection. The disturbance spread and led to large shutdowns of schools, undermined both traditional and colonial authorities, set up roadblocks around the region, and disrupted most aspects of life. Government in the area was largely replaced by the women who organized a separate leadership structure and were able to influence the situation around the region. The protest proved crucial in undermining the Kamerun National Congress (KNC), which had been in power in the region, and leading to the victory of the Kamerun National Democratic Party (KNDP). Similar protests continued in independent Cameroon with women organizing as a form of limited political protest, often against agricultural policy. Takembeng mobilizations=Background= Takembeng protests developed in the early 1990s, located primarily in the city of Bamenda. With political liberalization, including the first multi-party elections in 1992 and the legalization of opposition parties (including the important Social Democratic Front in the Northwest Province), Takembeng protests began to play a part of the wider political struggle. The movement became highly important following the 1992 elections and the disorder that followed in the Northwest Province, where much of the population believed the results were fraudulent and protests became widespread. =Practice= Since the early 1990s, most typically in the city of Bamenda, marches by groups of older women have been referred to as Takembeng. These protests involve groups of 30 to a couple hundred older women marching or protesting through the city, often taking part with other political protests affiliated with the main opposition party in Cameroon, the SDF. While the other protesters are quite loud and active at these protests, the Takembeng women remain largely silent while marching (which distinguishes the current manifestations from the earlier versions). Similarly, unlike the earlier practices, these recent movements include women from a variety of different ethnic groups. Although rural women provide a core part of the movement, it also includes urban women who live in Bamenda. However, some symbols and practices associated with the earlier forms of local action are continued in Takembeng. The women primarily wear old clothes (although some wear deliberately clashing bright colors) and many dress with plants which are believed to provide protective powers, prominently the nkung plant. Men and uninvolved women deliberately avoid the Takembeng women and there are rumors that men become ill or die if they observe the Takembeng women naked. Rumors are widely circulated that soldiers and government forces which do not adhere to these conventions either die or lose their wives. As a result, soldiers and security forces change tactics when engaging with Takembeng women. Most, but not all, of the participants are post-menopausal women and the older women are the leaders of the most challenging behaviors. Post-menopausal women are of key importance because they are believed not to be vulnerable to witchcraft which may take away their fertility, because they have esteem in their communities, and because they have more time for activities. In terms of tactics, the Takembeng women use their numbers and the social status accorded to older women in order to protect other protesters. In certain instances, the women use nudity and urinating and defecating in public as key aspects of their protest. Showing their vaginas or threatening to do so provide a unique power for the women and these tactics are quite effective in preventing troops or security forces from intervening in the protests. Historian Henry Kam Kah explains that \\"The symbolisation in this threat of the vagina shows the central role of women in matters of procreation. Reverence for the vagina is reverence for the woman and her creator. A woman can lose all else but not her vagina which is representative of her entire womanhood. Women do not expose them carelessly and when this happens or threats are made to this effect, men take to their heels for they cannot abuse the part of the body that brought them to mother earth. In fact, in contemporary Cameroon, the Takembeng women of Mankon, Bamenda, used the vagina as a weapon to lend support to the Social Democratic Front (SDF) party and dispel the gun trotting [sic] military men.\\" Similarly, Susan Diduk explains that ‚Äúit is less that female nakedness affronts onlookers, and more that displaying female genitalia is a powerful act of moral censure embodying widely shared assumptions about mystical power and pollution.‚Äù These more direct forms of activism are not undertaken without great care being taken. Younger women are not included in these practices and are kept a good distance away from these demonstrations and soldiers and security forces are warned before they occur. The Takembeng women provide a unique political organization in the restrictive political environment of Cameroon. In order to avoid being stopped by security forces as they walk from rural areas to urban centers they wear better clothing on the trip. However, when they march, the state responds with less violent measures than they do with other protesters (although at times, Takembeng women are also placed under house arrest, beaten, and killed by the government). As a result of this greater tolerance, Takembeng women provide some key support to the opposition party, the Social Democratic Front (SDF). In 1998, Takembeng women provided a protective caravan for John Fru Ndi, SDF Chairman, to leave the country and make a political trip to France and the United States. Although they are related closely with the SDF, the members of the Takembeng are clear in interviews that they are not a branch or tool of the party; instead, they support the ideals of the party and as long as the SDF holds to those values, their protests will overlap. During the disorder of the early 1990s, Takembeng women were recorded disrupting troops from elsewhere in Cameroon by stripping in front of them. Takembeng women do not limit their involvement to protest with many taking place in traditional moral guardianship in their home communities and also increasingly taking an active role in promoting community development activities.

Anlu is a traditional practice in the Kom communities of the Northwest Region of Cameroon. The practice revolves around groups of women gathering together and engaging in extreme behavior to shame and ostracize individuals who break community morals, such as physical abuse of a pregnant woman or incest. The origin of the practice is said to come from a time the women of Kom communities were the only people left to defend the towns from an invading force and so dressed as men and caused the opposition army to flee. The traditional practice became relevant with large-scale, political mobilizations by women from 1958 until 1961. This political anlu paralyzed both traditional and colonial administration in the Kom region and disrupted courts, schools, markets, and travel through the region. Traditional anlu=Origins= Oral traditions claim that anlu was created when, during war, all the males were slaughtered (in some versions this is in Bamessi). The story records that the Kom people were a tributary to a chief in Mejang and their tribute was to build a house in the Mejang city every year. Eventually, the Kom refused and Mejang dispatched an army to put down the rebellion. The Mejang forces decided to attack while the men were hunting and capture all the women. The women heard about this and so dressed in male clothing and went with crude weapons to meet the Mejang. The men fled from what they thought were the troops of Kom and only one was captured. The women stripped off their clothing to reveal that the Mejang forces had been defeated by women and Mejang became a Kom tributary after that point. =Practice= Divisions of Northwest Cameroon. The Kom communities are primarily in the Boyo and Menchum divisions. Traditional anlu, similar to fombuen or keluh in Kedjom Keku communities and ndofoumbgui in the Aghem tribe, involves groups of women organizing and shaming individuals who violate certain moral rules. The ostracizing could develop as a result of any set of offenses that violated community morality and were believed to threaten the life of the community (by damaging fertility, food, or prosperity). These offenses could include insulting one's mother, physically abusing a pregnant or nursing woman, committing incest, or other offenses. The women would respond with actions considered outside of the communities moral order (vulgar speech, display of genitals, dress in men's clothing, defecation on the offender's property, etc.) in order to highlight the egregiousness of the offense and pressure for repayment. The women themselves are organized under the leadership of the oldest woman of the community, named the na-anlu. Other men of the community would not intervene or interfere in the anlu, and could become a target of anlu if they did interfere, and husbands of women involved would take over household tasks. Anthropologist Paul Nkwi makes clear that while men typically retain power in traditional Kom communities, during anlu \\"the men are virtually powerless\\" and the traditional chiefs and councils are weakened. The ostracism and punishment of offending individuals would only end when they beg and declare their renunciation of the actions. After this is accepted and a fee is paid, the individual is taken to a stream and immersed in water and the anlu ends. =Description= Francis Nkwain has provided one of the most popular descriptions of anlu: Many of the descriptive aspects change depending on the offense or the village, but many aspects are retained throughout the region. Political anlu (1958‚Äì1961) At the end of the colonial period, a large-scale anlu was able to disrupt life in the North-West Province of Cameroon from 1958 until 1961. The anlu was organized around grievances by women over the agricultural policy of British and the Kamerun National Congress (KNC) and were used by the Kamerun National Democratic Party (KNDP) to dislodge the KNC from power. It is sometimes claimed that Augustine Ngom Jua, an important male leader of the KNDP, was a manipulator behind the scene, but accounts vary regarding his influence. The administration of the colony was promoting a transition from horizontal farming which largely ignored terrain to contour farming which fits with the frame and women, who did most of the agricultural work, resisted the transition. At the same time an unfounded rumor spread that the Kom traditional land would be sold to either the chairman of the KNC or to Igbo people in Nigeria (the KNC at this point had a platform of having the region join with Nigeria). The KNDP organized their efforts in the region emphasizing the women as key in the political situation. E. M. L. Endeley, the premier of the Southern Cameroon House of Assembly, was scheduled to travel through the Kom region to prepare for elections in 1959. Just prior to his scheduled visit, on 4 July 1958, a meeting was held in the town of Njinikom for a regional council member, Chia K. Bartholomew or C.K. Barth, to explain the contour farming law. Women surrounded the meeting before it adjourned and started the anlu with the traditional shrill cry. Bartholomew escaped from the meeting being chased by the women to the local priest's house. After a couple of hours, he left and returned home where the women gathered again that night. The women dressed in rags, men's clothing, and traditional vines spent the night following the usual anlu practices of shaming Bartholomew and polluting his yard. The movement was led by two women, Fuam (called the Queen) and Muana (called the Divisional Officer), who became the central political actors in the Kom region. The titles, Queen and Divisional Officer, were developed as mockery of the British colonial administration. The women led from the town of Wombong and created a parallel administrative structure during the disruptions from July 1958 until early 1961. Rumors spread immediately that schools and markets would be disrupted by similar groups of women around the region and on 7 July there were the first in a series of disruptions to schools. The women were able to set up multiple roadblocks and to prevent supporters from attending the 11 July visit by KNC Chairman Endeley. KNC supporters were ostracized and the women forbade anyone from visiting the houses of KNC supporters or suspected supporters. The women began ceremonial mock burials of KNC officials and supporters and it was believed by some that the anlu resulted in the sudden death on 21 December of the KNC Chairman for the Kom region, Joseph Ndong Nkwain. The women disrupted courts, schools, and markets throughout the Kom region for the rest of the year with protests and disruptive activity. Administrative mechanisms, both traditional and colonial, proved to be entirely powerless and the protests continued. Anthropologist Paul Nkwi explains that \\"The demonstrations were so wild that no police action could handle it. Only a few police officers were despatched to cover the event, and government had only to dialogue with the women. Even the traditional ruler, Foyn Alo'o Ndiforngu became virtually powerless. The women had taken over control of tribal affairs.\\" The movement was diverse with a number of different protests being organized by different groups in various villages. In late July 1958, the police were sent to arrest the leaders of the anlu movement, who peacefully surrendered to the authorities. However, women from throughout the region gathered in Bamenda to protest the arrests and the authorities released the leaders and provided transportation for the protesters back home. The leadership largely directed how the women participants should vote in the 1959 and 1961 elections, in which women voted heavily for the KNDP. The movement was crucial in leading the KNDP to victory in the elections in 1959 and 1961. From 1959 until 1961, anlu was able to get most of their demands met through working with the KNDP which was now in power. It is not clear if the policy regarding contour agriculture was reversed. The anlu movement dissipated in 1959 and ended completely with the 1961 election and the significant victory by the (KNDP). At the beginning of that year, the mobilizations and activism subsided and women returned to their agriculture and households. The leaders retained importance after the anlu with Muana becoming a prominent judge in the customary court. The residents of the region disagree about whether the cleansing ritual from traditional anlu has occurred. The traditional and political form provide the symbolic basis for the Takembeng protests by women in Cameroon since the 1990s. Those protests cross ethnic lines and join women from throughout the Northwest Province together in actions similar to anlu.

It is found in shallow parts of the China Sea and in the vicinity of the Korean archipelago. The tissues of this starfish have been found to contain several secondary metabolites with medicinal potential. Subspecies There are three subspecies: *Luidia quinaria bispinosa Djakonov, 1950 *Luidia quinaria chinensis Doderlein, 1920 *Luidia quinaria quinaria von Martens, 1865 Description Luidia quinaria has a small central disc and five long slender arms fringed with short spines. The aboral (upper) surface is covered in small paxillae, pillar-like spines with flat tops giving a smooth, table-like surface. The general colour of the aboral surface is grey with contrasting pink or orange margins to the arms. The oral (under) surface is paler. Biology Luidia quinaria is a predator and is found in shallow water on soft sediments. In Ise Bay in central Japan, it was found living throughout the oxygen-poor waters of the bay while another starfish, Astropecten scoparius, tended to occupy a separate zone near the mouth of the bay. Examination of the stomach contents of both starfish showed that Luidia quinaria largely fed on other echinoderms, in particular the brittle star Ophiura kinbergi, which formed more than half of the diet. The other starfish largely consumed molluscs, including the snail Voorwindia paludinoides and the clam Alvenius ojianus. The differences in the diet were thought to be due to the different availability of food items in various parts of the bay, these being due to variations in the type of sediment. Several different biologically active steroids have been isolated from the tissues of Luidia quinaria. One of these, an asterosaponin, may prove useful in the treatment of coughs and asthma and may help clear mucus from airways.

It opened in 1886 and closed in 1924. History The Willis Avenue station (top). Willis Avenue station was opened on November 25, 1886 by the Suburban Rapid Transit Company as a connecting spur to the Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad's Harlem River Terminal Station. The HR&PC; was chartered 20 years earlier and operated trains owned by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The station was located next to the 133rd Street Yard, and served both the Second and Third Avenue line trains. The spur ran from the 129th Street Station in Manhattan across the Harlem River Bridge, thereby creating two separate transportation hubs on both sides of the Harlem River. Suburban Rapid Transit was acquired by the Manhattan Railway Company in 1891, and then by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company in 1902. By 1912, the station would also begin to serve the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, an electrified commuter line serving the Bronx and southern Westchester County. Despite the name the railroad never actually reached Boston. For the next decade the station became a vital link not only for rapid transit commuters, but interurban, commuter rail, and intercity rail passengers. The station was closed for IRT service on April 14, 1924, when a connecting pedestrian bridge was opened between the nearby Third Avenue El station at 133rd Street, although the Third Avenue Line continued to cross the Harlem River until 1955. The HR&PC; was officially merged with the New Haven Railroad on January 1, 1927. Harlem River Station continued to serve the New Haven Railroad and New York, Westchester and Boston Railway until 1930 when the NYNH&H; left, and was closed completely on December 31, 1937, when the NYW&B; fell into bankruptcy.Harlem River NYW&B; Station (New York, Westchester, and Boston Railway Website) See also *Harlem River Intermodal Yard ReferencesExternal links *Willis Avenue Spur images (NYCSubway.org) Category:IRT Second Avenue Line stations Category:IRT Third Avenue Line stations Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1886 Category:Railway stations closed in 1924 Category:Former elevated and subway stations in the Bronx Category:Defunct New York City Subway stations located aboveground Category:Mott Haven, Bronx ","title":"Willis Avenue station"},{"id":"38199339","text":"Jos√© Ignacio Mart√≠nez Garc√≠a (born 7 March 1989), commonly known as Nacho, is a Spanish footballer who plays for Real Valladolid as a left back.

It is found in shallow water in the East China Sea and around the coasts of Japan. It is a grey starfish and each of its five arms has a narrow pale margin. It burrows in the muddy sediments on the seabed and feeds on molluscs. Distribution Astropecten scoparius occurs in the East China Sea and around the islands of Hokkaido, Honshu and Kyushu. Biology Astropecten scoparius is a predator and is found on the seabed in shallow water or buried in soft sediments. In Ise Bay in central Japan, it lives near the mouth of the bay, while another starfish, Luidia quinaria, predominates in other parts of the bay. Astropecten scoparius feeds largely on molluscs such as the clam Alvenius ojianus and the small gastropod Voorwindia paludinoides while Luidia quinaria is adept at catching brittle stars (Ophiura kinbergi) and other echinoderms. Astropecten scoparius mostly breeds between June and August. Both females and males liberate gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place. The bipinnaria larvae that hatch from the eggs are planktonic. They are bilaterally symmetrical and have a pair of body processes, a gut and two bands of cilia which are used for swimming. They feed and grow but do not pass through a brachiolaria stage as do most starfish larvae. After about eighteen days they settle on the seabed where they undergo metamorphosis. At this stage they become radially symmetrical, each one having a single central plate, a madreporite plate, five radial and five interradial plates, and five terminal plates which are the first stage in the development of the arms. A central mouth also develops on the oral (under) surface and the juvenile starts to feed. Toxicity In some circumstances, Astropecten scoparius contains the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, also known as TTX. This starfish accumulates lesser quantities of the toxin than does its close relative Astropecten polyacanthus. Both have been associated with cases of paralytic shellfish poisoning of humans in Japan caused by consumption of the trumpet shell Charonia lampas. It is believed that the toxin is passed through the food chain, the trumpet shell having acquired it through feeding on the starfish. The starfish may themselves have incorporated TTX into their tissues through feeding on certain tiny gastropod molluscs Umborium suturale.

Port, (March 7, 1911 ‚Äì June 11, 2007) was a philanthropist, a lawyer and high school and college basketball player. Port grew up in his father's downtown Chicago hotel, Antlers Hotel, at Clark and Lake Street. He started an industrial repair and maintenance parts company called Lawson Products in 1952. High school A native of Chicago, Illinois, Port attended Lane Tech High School from 1924 to 1928. He played basketball and was a center who led the Indians to an overall record of 29 wins, 15 losses in his four years. College Port chose to play basketball at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign after high school. He spent his first season on the freshman team, moving to the varsity squad as a sophomore. However, he only played in 7 of the 35 games during the next two years as an Illini and decided to focus on his studies as a senior. After graduating from Illinois in 1933, Port continued his education at DePaul University, receiving a law degree. Professional career and later life After deciding he could not make enough money as a lawyer, Port joined his father-in-law's business, Lion Auto Parts. He rose to executive vice president and then started Lawson Products. As of 2015, the company sells and distributes more than 300,000 specialized parts, systems and services to industrial clients. Lawson Products, which is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, was named after Victor Lawson, owner of the Chicago Daily News and a philanthropist whom Port admired. Lawson Products grew steadily and in 1970 went public, a move that allowed Port to focus more time on philanthropic efforts. Port was able to give millions to hospitals, schools and arts organizations. Port donated approximately $5 million to the University of Illinois at Chicago, where four student and faculty centers carry the Port name. Among them are the Rebecca Port Student Center & Cafe, the Sandi Port Errant Language and Culture Learning Center, the Port Academic Center in the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics and the Sidney L. Port Hall of Excellence. He also served as a trustee of Shimer College. Port underwrote productions at the Lyric Opera. He was a major donor to the Art Institute of Chicago and the Joffrey Ballet; Mt. Sinai Hospital and the Gastro-Intestinal Research Foundation at the University of Chicago. He also supported many Jewish organizations in Chicago and Palm Springs, his winter home for years. He contributed to a wide range of political campaigns. Beneficiaries included former Governor George Ryan and former Cook County Board President John Stroger and most significantly, Mayor Richard M. Daley. Port began buying horses in the 1970s, and his partners included the legendary trainer Charlie Whittingham. At his peak, Port owned about 200 horses. He was a regular at Arlington Park racetrack in Arlington Heights, Illinois and at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California during his stays in Palm Springs. Port's wife, Bettie, died in 1998.

Biography Murray was born on 28 March 1747 in Stockholm, son of the Prussian-born preacher and theologian Andreas Murray (1695 - 1771). His brothers were the professors Johann Philipp Murray (1726-1776), Johan Anders Murray (1740-1791) and Adolph Murray (1751-1803). In 1760 Gustaf Murray became a student in Uppsala, and in 1768 became a Master of Philosophy in G√∂ttingen. He was ordained in 1770, and for the next four years was an assistant minister at the German church in Stockholm. In 1774 he was made the court chaplain of Duke Charles, the future Charles XIII of Sweden. In 1778 he became a Doctor of Divinity, and in 1780 pastor of the Jakobs and Johannes parishes in Stockholm. In 1793 he was a member of the Committee for improving the Church handbook, hymn book and catechism. As a pastor he worked extensively for the relief of the poor. He established a voluntary workhouse, organized collections and arranged for free practical education and gifts of clothing and footwear for the children of poor families. In 1801 Murray was promoted to first pastor and vicar of Great Church Assembly. In 1809, after the political revolution, he was made the court preacher and nominal bishop. He was knighted in 1810 and in 1811 was appointed Bishop of the Diocese of V√§ster√•s. Gustaf Murray died on 4 May 1825 in V√§ster√•s. His children were Gustaf Anders 1784-1824, Carl Erik 1786-1870, Charlotta Wilhelmina 1788-1858, Sophia Lovisa 1790, Axel Wilhelm 1794-1796, Augusta Sophia 1796-1828, Johanna Lovisa 1798-1858 and Johan Jacob 1800-1870.

The film premiered in competition at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival. Plot At the end of her career the sculptor Camille Claudel seems to suffer with mental issues. She destroys her own statues and utters repeatedly that her former lover Auguste Rodin intended to make her life miserable. Consequently, her younger brother Paul sends her to an asylum on the outskirts of Avignon. Claudel tries to convince her doctor she is perfectly sane, while living among patients who obviously are not. She is desperate to see her brother again, hoping he might eventually support her plea. Cast * Juliette Binoche as Camille Claudel * Jean-Luc Vincent as Paul Claudel * Robert Leroy as the doctor * Emmanuel Kauffmann as the priest * Marion Keller as Miss Blanc * Armelle Leroy-Rolland as the young novice Reception According to Cine Vue's Patrick Gamble the filmmaker Bruno Dumont has delivered an \\"incredibly compassionate and humble observation of a tortured artist\\". Variety's Guy Lodge described the film as a \\"moving account of a brief period in the later life of the troubled sculptress\\" and appreciated Juliette Binoche's impersonation of Camille Claudel as nothing less than \\"mesmerising\\". Screen Internationals Jonathan Romney ranked this film as \\"an amplification and indeed a deepening\\" of Dumont's hitherto existing accomplishments and artistic impact. Eric Kohn of IndieWire stated the film had a \\"concision\\" which displayed \\"an exactitude worthy of Robert Bresson\\". Analysing the film in depth for The Hollywood Reporter, Jordan Mintzer summed up the film in his \\"bottom line\\": \\"An unsettling portrait of the artist as a mad woman, anchored by a riveting lead performance\\".

It has been crafting German-style lagers since 1989. It was a pioneer of lager in microbrewing,. following the strict requirements of the German Reinheitsgebot,. and it continues to specialize in craft lagers..  Beer  The beers made by Sudwerk include California Dry Hop Lager, which was created by replacing the German hops with Pacific Northwestern hops in the recipe of the Helles Lager; Northern Pilsner; M√§rzen Amber Lager; Hefeweizen Bavarian Wheat; Cascaderade India Pale Lager; and 3 Best Friends. Seasonal beers include Mai Bock Spring Lager in spring, Fest Harvest Lager in fall, and Doppel Bock Ulimator in winter. The Helles Lager, Northern Pilsner, Marzen Amber Lager, and Hefeweizen are brewed using the same family recipes originally brought to California by Sudwerk's first German Brewmeister.  History  Ron Broward and Dean Unger founded Sudwerk in 1989 as Sudwerk Privatbrauerei Hubsch. It was the first brewpub in Davis, and the only one there until the 2015 opening of another brewpub, the Three Mile Brewing Company.. By 1993, when it went through a major expansion, Sudwerk had become the largest microbrewery in the US. Jay Prahl was hired as brewmaster in 2003, and Broward and Unger sold off the associated restaurant in 2006. After the two founders died in 2011 and 2013, the brewery was sold to Unger's grandson, Trent Yackzan, and his friend Ryan Fry, who quickly promoted long-time employee Mike Hutson to brewmaster. In 2015, they began distributing their beer to states outside California, beginning in Missouri.. The restaurant which operated independently from the brewery closed at the end of June, 2016. As of 2018, Sudwerk has won a total of 13 medals at the Great American Beer Festival including three gold medals. The brewery maintains close ties to the University of California, Davis, where Prahl and Hutson were educated, and its facilities include classrooms used by extension classes at UC Davis.

The region is the location of Walmart Home Office; city and county government facilities; and most of Bentonville's tourist attractions for the city and contains many historically and architecturally significant properties. Downtown measures approximately and is defined as the region between Tiger Boulevard to the north, Highway 102 (AR 102) to the south, Walton Boulevard (U.S. Route 71B) to the west and J Street to the east. Similar to other central business districts in the US, Downtown has recently undergone a transformation that included the construction of new condos and lofts, renovation of historic buildings, and arrival of new residents and businesses. Upon opening of Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art the increased tourist traffic related to the museum has made Downtown Bentonville one of the state's most popular tourism destinations. Master Plan In the early 2000s, Bentonville adopted a University of Arkansas study that outlined a renovation of the downtown area. Input meetings were held in 2003 with residents and merchants communicating their visions to city administration. Committees selected identified the vision and implementation strategies. In 2004, the Master Plan went into effect. The Master Plan for rehabilitation of Bentonville's downtown includes creating gateways to the district, adding public art, trees, street furniture, parking, and trails while removing overhead utilities and unsightly areas. The plan also suggests maintaining historic architecture and restricting future constructions. Crystal Bridges A wing of Crystal Bridges spans Crystal Spring Alice Walton led the Walton Family Foundation's development of the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, a premier museum dedicated to American art and artists. The museum includes walking trails and educational opportunities in addition to displaying over 450 works covering five centuries of American art. The museums is the most popular in the state, with 604,000 visitors in 2012, its first year. The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) building was designed by world-renowned architect Moshe Safdie. Trails connect Crystal Bridges to the Bentonville Square while giving tourists an opportunity to explore the outdoors in the Ozarks. A total of six trails feature educational opportunities to learn about native Arkansas plant life as well as public art. Bentonville Square The Bentonville Square (sometimes Public Square) is a town square in Bentonville that includes the several historically and architecturally significant properties surrounding Public Square Park. The Square is anchored by the Benton County Courthouse on the east side and Walmart Visitor's Center on the west side. =Confederate Soldier Monument= The Bentonville Confederate Monument, installed in the center of Square Park, was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1996. =Benton County Courthouse= Benton County Courthouse, July 2011 The Benton County Courthouse has been the home of Benton County government since it was built by Albert O. Clark in 1928. The Classical Revival structure features keystones, round-topped windows, and the inscription \\"Sovereignty rests with the people\\" in a large concrete block above the main entrance. The structure was added to the NRHP in 1988, along with many other historical structures in Benton County. =Bogart Hardware Building and Roy's Office Supply Building= The Bogart Hardware Building (112 E Central) and Roy's Office Supply Building (110 E Central) were built c. 1885 on the south side of the Bentonville square. The original appearances of the buildings has remained intact more than any neighboring structure on the square. The Bogart Hardware Building's original corbelled brick cornice remains in good condition. Roy's Office Supply Building, built with Italianate style, was constructed with two different storefronts in order to accommodate two distinct tenants. Even the original floor remains intact. Together, these two structures have retained the largest amount of original storefront that was typical of the Bentonville square at the turn of the century. Both structures were added to the NRHP in 1988. =Hotel Massey= Hotel Massey is a former hotel in downtown Bentonville, built in 1910 in the Renaissance Revival architectural style. Occupying an important corner in Bentonville, Hotel Massey replaced the Eagle Hotel, which had stood on the site since 1840. Home to many notable businesses on its first floor, the building is considered an important historic landmark by the community. The hotel's architectural style is also uncommon in Arkansas, and especially the Ozarks. Due to its dual significance, Hotel Massey was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. =Terry Block Building= Terry Block Building, with original Walton 5 & 10 facade visible on the right The Terry Block Building is a commercial building on the west side of the Bentonville square built in 1888. Built by Colonel William A. Terry, the building is the largest on the square and communicates message of the prosperous 1880s economy. Terry owned and operated a dry goods store and was president of the Benton County Bank, also located in the building. Today the building is owned by Walmart and operated as a retro 1950s soda fountain and ice cream parlor. Events Downtown Bentonville plays host to many annual events, including Winter Wonderland in December and Independence Day events in July. Pickin' on the Square, a gathering of local musicians playing country, blues, and bluegrass music, and the Bentonville Farmer's Market both take place weekly between May and October. \\"First Fridays\\" takes place April through November include different themed events sponsored by downtown businesses. Beginning in 2015, Bentonville has hosted the Bentonville Film Festival each May.

Constructed in 1905‚Äì06, the Tramway climbed above sea level and crossed ten bridges. After coal mining ceased the tramway was used to transport logs, fruit and passengers. The line was lifted and abandoned in 1922 after bushfires destroyed several bridges along the line. Currently, of the old track is used as cycling/walking tracks, while the remainder of the old line is on private property. History The narrow gauge steel tramway was built by the Sandfly Colliery Company in 1906. In 1904, of rail, one locomotive and 47 wagons were purchased from the contractors, Messrs. Henrickson and Knutson of Dunalley. The cost to the company was AU¬£1000. By 1916 the tramway was owned by the Tasmanian Wallsend Company, and when the coal seam became unproductive the company was bought out by the state government. Between 1917 and 1921 the line was leased to Kingborough Council for the purpose of transporting local freightcitation at Channel Heritage Museum, Margate, Tasmania before being dismantled in 1922 and shipped to the colliery at Catamaran. Route The tramway left the Wharf at Margate and crossed the Channel Highway, Hickman's Road, Van Morrey Road, McGowans Road, Perrins Saddle, Thomson Creek and Pelverata Road. It reached a maximum gradient of 1:28 between Channel Highway and Hickmans Road.Whitham L. S., The Sandfly Coalmine and Tramway, 1974, quoted in Channel Heritage Museum, Margate, Tasmania Rolling Stock Motive power was supplied by two Krauss tank locomotives. Krauss 4526 (2-4-0T builder's number 4526 constructed 1902) was purchased from Messrs. Hendrickson and Knutson, arriving at the colliery in 1906. It was later sold to the Catamaran Colliery Company and then repaired with parts from Krauss 4080 in 1940. The other locomotive (2-4-0T 5682, 1906) weighed and had cylinders and driving wheels. It was purchased new by the Colliery from Lohmann Brothers of Melbourne, agents for Krauss, and shipped to Margate, arriving in early 1907. Being new and heavier than 4526, it was regarded as the colliery's No. 1 locomotive. After 1914, it was the Colliery's sole locomotive. A bushfire in January 1920 left 5682 stranded and, as rebuilding a burned bridge was too expensive, the locomotive was left idle with a timber shed built around it for protection. In June 1922, the dismantling of the tramway from the colliery end reached the locomotive and it was removed to Margate, a temporary section of line having been built around the burnt bridge. The locomotive was sold to the Electrona Carbide Works for use on the Ida Bay line. It now resides at the Redwater Creek Steam Railway in Sheffield.

Plans were available but only one was built. Design and development The Draggin' Fly was designed to be easy to build, to have good short field characteristics and to have control characteristics matched to the skills of less experienced pilots. A four-cylinder Volkswagen air-cooled engine was selected for reliability and ease of maintenance. The sole example was constructed over ten months without plans, though a rib jig and propeller plot were used. It was first flown in May 1972. The Draggin' Fly had a constant chord parasol wing, built around two spruce spars and having slight dihedral. The wing was Dacron covered and carried no flaps; the ailerons were aluminium with a full span torque tube. It was held well above the fuselage on a pair of V-shaped bracing struts, assisted by inverted V-cabane struts fore and aft of the cockpit. The fuselage was a steel tube structure and Dacron covered over the forward, pod like part that housed the engine and cockpit but open and triangular in section as it extended rearwards into a tailboom at cabane height. The tail surfaces were again Dacron covered steel, wire braced with the tailplane placed at the bottom of the boom and with the lower rudder and a small ventral fin projecting below it. The Draggin' Fly had a fixed tricycle undercarriage, the mainwheels mounted on two V-form struts and half- axles hinged to the fuselage underside. All undercarriage legs used spring and rubber in compression type shock absorbers; the nose wheel was steerable. For its first flight and first eight hours of flight testing the Draggin' Fly was powered by a 36 hp (29 kW), 1.2 L Volkswagen engine but this was then replaced by a more powerful Volkswagen variant producing 50 hp (37 kW). Plans for amateur building were produced in March 1974.

It aired on Fox in the United States on April 14, 2013, and is written by Jeff Chiang and Eric Ziobrowski and directed by Pam Cooke and Valerie Fletcher. In the episode, unsatisfied with missionary sex, Francine finds out she has a spanking fetish when Stan tries to punish Steve. Meanwhile, Hayley tries to move on from Jeff being sent into outer space and agrees to go out on a date with Snot. Plot After the usual missionary position sex, Francine admits being bored and suggests some variations but Stan insists it is the natural way to have sex. Steve angers Stan at breakfast and receives a spanking. Francine objects and Stan demonstrates for her how he spanks to prove it does no lasting harm, but Francine finds it turns her on. Chatting with Roger, Francine asks how to approach Stan with her turn-on and Roger suggests she trick him. She uses an argument between Steve and Klaus as a pretense to get Stan to spank her again and agrees to take all of his spankings in the future resulting in a montage of incidents. Stan finally catches her tossing Steve's bicycle through the front window and decides to banish Francine to the woods as per a fake verse in his Bible as punishment. After two days in the woods, Stan returns but finds Francine is unrepentant and accuses Stan of being repressed. She refuses to leave until Stan opens up a bit. Later with Roger, Stan continues to call her a deviant and Roger convinces him to open up with a musical number, although Stan finds he wants to embrace every kink known to Roger's dread. Stan finds Francine and surprises her with a spanking and an openness to try new things, although even Francine gets reservations when Stan gets too weird. At home, Francine finds that Stan has arranged an audience while they make kinky love. Francine goes to Roger and admits she created a monster. Roger intervenes in a latex wetsuit and horrifies everyone including Stan back to normal. Francine makes up with Stan in the hospital while Roger is inside of Stan's body. To get her spanking fix, Francine joins a women's softball team, where the teammates spank Francine in celebration for good plays on field. Meanwhile, Snot decides to take advantage of Hayley's grief over Jeff and asks her out. To his surprise she agrees. After a date with Snot, Hayley returns in a good mood, but Snot finds he was only aroused by the pursuit of Haley; now that he has her, he is no longer interested. Steve confronts Snot and asks him to avoid breaking Hayley's heart. Snot decides to confess to being gay with Barry and Hayley decides to bow out, leaving Barry heartbroken when Snot leaves him as well. Reception Rob H. Dawson of TV Equals gave the episode a positive review, saying \\"It‚Äôs also nice to see an attempt at a multi-episode plot, the kind of thing American Dad usually doesn‚Äôt go for. We‚Äôre still dealing with Jeff‚Äôs absence, and although it‚Äôs in a less direct way this episode, it‚Äôs an interesting choice for the show to keep it on our minds. I would have liked if they hadn‚Äôt roped in Snot, however, because his character has never felt to me like anything worth spending time on. The one good moment here was in the end, when Barry manically latched onto Snot‚Äôs \\"I‚Äôm gay\\" ruse. Something about his delivery on those lines (\\"THIS IS WHAT HE LIKES!\\") sold it to me. But that was a minor thread in \\"The Missing Kink,\\" an episode that, barring one big, singing exception, kept up the funny for most of its running time.\\" Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, saying \\"It‚Äôs still fun to laugh at Stan for his strict conservative ways, but I‚Äôm glad that American Dad doles this type of story out in smaller parcels than it used to. It especially helps to pair Stan with someone else in the family trying to soften him, and Francine‚Äôs futile quest to introduce more adventure into their bedroom certainly combats Stan‚Äôs uptight, Bible-misquoting ways in a way that creates room for a lot of jokes. \\"The Missing Kink\\" may end in an unsatisfying way, returning to the same boring Smith sex life, but with Francine indulging elsewhere, but it still contains enough laughs and outlandish visuals to outshine the rough patches.\\" The episode was watched by a total of 4.23 million people, this made it the second most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show, Bob's Burgers and The Simpsons but losing to Family Guy with 5.02 million.

Early life Kalmus was born in Prague on 25 January 1933, and moved to Britain with his parents and younger brother George Kalmus in 1939. His sister Elsa was born in 1945. The family became British citizens in 1946. Education Kalmus went to school first in London and then in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. From 1943 till 1951 he was at St Albans County Grammar School (later renamed Verulam School). He received his BSc (1954) and PhD (1957) at University College London where he remained for a further three years as a Research Associate. He is now an Honorary Fellow of University College London. W and Z particles Discovery of the W particle. The proton-antiproton collision creates a W particle which then decays into a high-energy electron, emitted at a wide angle from the beam (indicated by the arrow at the bottom- right) and an invisible neutrino whose presence is deduced by the missing energy of the electron. Discovery of the Z particle. The central detector of UA1 reveals the tell-tale signature of the long-awaited Z particle as it decays into an electron-positron pair (arrowed). Among a number of notable achievements in his career, the Queen Mary, University of London group led by Peter Kalmus in conjunction with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory group led by Alan Astbury and the Birmingham University group led by John Dowell joined Carlo Rubbia at CERN in an international collaboration known as UA1. They built a large universal detector, aimed at investigating phenomena at the world's highest energy collisions, which were obtained from 1981 onwards, when the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron was converted into a proton-antiproton collider, as suggested by Rubbia, using the stochastic beam cooling technique devised by Simon van der Meer. The UK groups had joint responsibility for designing, constructing and operating a large hadron calorimeter and also a trigger processor. The most celebrated work with the UA1 detector was the discovery in 1983 of the W and Z particles. This discovery provided the experimental evidence for the unification of two of nature's seemingly very different fundamental forces: electromagnetism (which underlies electricity generation) and the weak force (which allows the Sun to shine). The unification of these two forces is part of a quest to see if all forces in the universe can be united into a \\"theory of everything\\" (Unified Field Theory). Electroweak unification demonstrated that what had previously been considered nature's four fundamental forces (electromagnetism, weak interaction, strong interaction and gravity) were now reduced to three. For this work Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer of CERN received the 1984 Nobel Prize for Physics. Alan Astbury received the 1984 Rutherford Medal and Prize, and Peter Kalmus and John Dowell were jointly awarded the 1988 Rutherford Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics for their outstanding roles in the discovery of the W and Z particles. Selected research 1957 to 1960 - Kalmus conducted research at UCL mainly on the development of new instruments, helping to build a small particle accelerator, a 29 MeV electron microtron, its beam extraction system, and its external focusing using quadrupole magnets (probably the first use of these in the UK), and later devising an accurate method of measuring relativistic electron beam energies using Cerenkov radiation, then a novel technique. 1960 to 1964 ‚Äì Kalmus worked for Argonne National Laboratory, USA, initially in the Particle Accelerator Division, directed by Albert Crewe. He was responsible for designing beam-transport equipment for the coming 12.5 Gev Zero Gradient Synchrotron. He transferred to the High Energy Physics Division and in 1961 went to CERN with an Argonne group headed by Art Roberts. It was at CERN that he first met John Dowell, and they designed and set up a particle beamline at the new 25 GeV Proton Synchrotron. The Argonne group used this beamline to conduct a series of measurements of hyperon polarisation using a large optical spark chamber inside a magnetic field: a pioneering technique which much later became the basis of many other electronic imaging chambers. On returning to Argonne in 1962 he collaborated with a Chicago group in an experiment on boson production, work which was finished during future visits to the USA as a visiting scientist at the University of Chicago. 1964 onwards ‚Äì Kalmus was appointed Lecturer at Queen Mary College, University of London. He began a research collaboration with Alan Astbury of Rutherford Laboratory, which was to continue for about 20 years, when Alan Astbury moved to Canada. The Queen Mary and Rutherford Laboratory collaboration carried out a series of experiments at the new Nimrod accelerator at Rutherford Laboratory, mostly in strong interaction physics: nucleon isobar production in proton-proton collisions and elastic proton-proton scattering at wide angles, this time using spark chambers with sonic readout. Results from this accelerator helped to lay the experimental foundations of the quark model. In 1970 this collaboration transferred their activities to CERN, to embark on a series of experiments on low energy antiproton-proton interactions. In this they were joined by physicists from Daresbury Laboratory and the University of Liverpool. Kalmus designed the (then) most intense low energy antiproton beam in the world. The experiments on differential cross sections and polarisation for the elastic and two-body meson channels culminated in the discovery of three new mesons and a determination of their quantum numbers. The period 1974 to 1978 was spent carrying out the last set of experiments at Nimrod. Kalmus designed a new low momentum beamline, this time for kaons, for a series of experiments with a polarised deuteron target. Several key measurements were made on kaon-nucleon elastic and charge exchange polarisation. In late 1977 the Queen Mary group led by Peter Kalmus, along with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory group under Alan Astbury and the Birmingham University group led by John Dowell joined Carlo Rubbia in the international collaboration known as UA1 at CERN. The UK groups involved had joint responsibility for designing, building and operating a large hadron calorimeter and also a trigger processor as part of the UA1 collaboration. The calorimeter, which measured the energies of strongly-interacting particles emerging from collisions, consisted of 7,000 sheets of plastic scintillator with a total mass of 30 tonnes placed in slots in the return yoke of a large electromagnet. Testing of the scintillator sheets was carried out at Queen Mary using cosmic rays. The scintillator light was transferred via fluorescent wavelength-shifter bars and light guides to 2000 photomultipliers outside the magnet. The number of proton-antiproton collisions exceeded the ability to record these by a factor of at least 1000. This necessitated the design of a trigger processor, a purpose-built electronic device which had to make decisions within 2 microseconds on which 1 in 1000 collisions was likely to be worth recording on magnetic tape for subsequent analysis, and which 999 could be discarded irretrievably. Some years later when the collision rate had increased, a new trigger processor was built. The most celebrated work with the UA1 detector led to the discovery in 1983 of the W and Z particles. This work resulted in Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer of CERN receiving the 1984 Nobel Prize for Physics. In 1988, Peter Kalmus and John Dowell were jointly awarded the Rutherford Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics for their outstanding roles in the discovery of the W and Z particles (Alan Astbury had already received this medal in 1984). UA1 was perhaps the most productive collaboration in the history of particle physics up to that date. It yielded results in quark and lepton physics, tests of quantum chromodynamics, properties of W and Z particles and other topics, which have been published in over 60 papers and presented at numerous conferences. The concept of a universal detector, measuring as much as possible of the outgoing particles from a collider, and covering nearly the whole of the solid angle, has been used ever since at colliding beam machines. This work finished in 1989. At the end of 1989 the Queen Mary group joined another large collaboration called H1. The H1 collaboration had embarked on building a huge detector for the world's first proton-electron collider, HERA, which was being constructed at the DESY laboratory in Hamburg. The Queen Mary group was responsible for designing and constructing a time-of-flight hodoscope for H1, a piece of apparatus that proved crucial to the operation of the experiment as it reduced the unwanted background by a factor of a hundred. Many of the initiatives came from Kalmus's colleagues Graham Thompson and Eric Eisenhandler, particularly after Kalmus became Head of Department at Queen Mary, University of London in 1992 and had less time for research. Publications Kalmus is the author or co- author of about 230 scientific papers. He has always emphasised that modern experimental particle physics research is a group activity, and that past and present colleagues and research students have contributed strongly to the strength of the group. Academia and education In parallel with his research activities, Kalmus was a dedicated university teacher. He has taught numerous physics courses, ranging from pre-university A-level to international postgraduate school standard. His initial teaching was in the evenings at Northern Polytechnic and at Chelsea Polytechnic during the period 1955 to 1960. He has taught at all levels at Queen Mary College (Now Queen Mary, University of London), since 1964. Kalmus became Reader at Queen Mary in 1966 and Professor in 1978. In 1992 Kalmus was appointed Head of Department at Queen Mary. This severely curtailed his personal involvement in the H1 research programme, which however continued to flourish with the strong participation of his colleagues. Kalmus was given the title Emeritus Professor in 1998 after reaching nominal retirement age. However he continued to work normal hours in the department. He decided not to continue his participation in collaborative research involving enormous teams, and instead to devote more time to other physics interests, such as the Institute of Physics, and in particular to the public awareness and understanding of science. Peter Kalmus continues to be active as Emeritus Professor of Physics at Queen Mary, University of London. Public understanding of science Kalmus has always been interested in furthering the public awareness and understanding of science. He started giving outreach lectures in the late 1950s, initially on nuclear power (then a novel source of electricity) to Women's Institutes. Kalmus was a pioneer in this, because at this time the popularisation of science was regarded with suspicion by some senior members of the science establishment. However, Kalmus always felt that scientists had a duty to explain what they were doing, and persisted throughout his career. Following an influential report by the Royal Society and particularly after the new UK Research Councils came into existence in 1994, such outreach activities became not only respectable but almost mandatory. Kalmus is known in physics for his outreach work and for his popular lectures to schools and general audiences. These have also been delivered at meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (now called the British Science Association), at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, the Institute of Physics, the Association for Science Education, the Edinburgh Science Festival, the Bournemouth Arts Festival, to science and astronomy clubs, and abroad in several continents. He has made a number of short radio broadcasts on scientific topics, and appeared occasionally on TV. During the 1998‚Äì99 academic year he gave the Institute of Physics Schools Lecture 43 times in various venues in England, Scotland, Wales and the Channel Islands to a total audience of about 9,800 people, mostly in the 15 - 19 age group. At the invitation of the South African Institute of Physics this lecture-demonstration was repeated at 15 universities in South Africa during a 3-week period in early 2000, to a total audience of 3,500 consisting of university students and staff, senior school pupils, and members of the general public. He subsequently gave this talk to other audiences in Dublin, Belfast and several venues in Britain.

She was the founder and president of the Bulgarian women's movement organisation –ñ–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –æ–±—â–∏–Ω–∞ (1869). She worked for the establishment of girl's schools and the right for equal education opportunities for females. Life Eugenia Kisimova was born in Turnovo as the daughter of the wealthy merchant Hadji Georgi Kisimov. She was the sister of the educator and cultural personality Pandeli Kisimov, and through her sister Maria the sister-in-law of the doctor and archaeologist Vasil Beron. She was educated in a school for girls. As an adult in the 1850s, Kisimova wished for women to participate in society outside of a secluded life in the home. Born into a leading family in Turnovo, she established contacts with noted figures in the cultural and intellectual life, such as Vasil Cholakov, Petko Gorbanov, Petko Slavejkov, Zachary Princely and Stoyan Robovski. In 1869, she founded the first women's organisation in Bulgaria, the –ñ–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –æ–±—â–∏–Ω–∞, and was elected as its first president. The purpose was to provide education for women, and its first action was to raise funds to start schools for girls in the city and the areas around it, and employ teachers for them. In 1870, the association also started Sunday schools. The association provided scholarships and made it possible for women to study abroad in countries were higher education was open to women, preferably in Russia and Romania. Several Bulgarian female pioneers had their studies abroad financed by the association, such as Eugenia Shekerdzhieva, who was financed to study in Russia in 1876 and 1879. During the Russian-Turkish War (1877-1878), Kismova organised the –ú–∏–ª–æ—Å—ä—Ä–¥–∏–µ, a fund raising to organize and finance nurses to medical care for the wounded, as well as receive and care for war refugees.

The band was founded in 2009 by Peter Vanderloos (guitar, vocals) and consists of frontman Graham Fenton (lead vocals), Lucas Gordon (drums, vocals), and Brad Crowell (bass, vocals). In late 2011 after parting ways with the band's original lineup, Vanderloos would meet Fenton by chance in a Los Angeles restaurant. Together with Gordon and Crowell, the four collectively are A Million Pieces. A Million Pieces has written two studio releases, A Million Pieces EP in 2011 and Supernatural EP to be released in 2013. History=Formation and debut EP (2009‚Äì2011)= In 2009 while living in a communal facility in Southern California, Peter Vanderloos would collaborate with original vocalist Morgan Freed to begin writing songs for a pop punk envisioned project; while at the same time settling on the band's name after a lyric inspired the duo coinciding with events in the book A Million Little Pieces. After deciding to become serious with the band, Vanderloos would add original OneRepublic drummer Jerrod 'Skins' Bettis as the group's producer/touring drummer, as well as Stephen Soss, and Ryan Brown to the band's lineup. In the spring of 2011, A Million Pieces would enlist musical arranger and choreographer Printz Board of The Black Eyed Peas to produce and facilitate the release of their debut EP. During the summer of the same year, A Million Pieces would release a music video for the first single from the EP entitled Laserbeams. Over the next few months Laserbeams would be selected to appear on MTV's Logo Network as part of its NewNowNextPopLab and would win MTVU's 'Freshmen Battle' for the music video to appear on full rotation on the popular college television outlet. Eventually, the videos online presence would travel globally landing a spot on the MTV Asia broadband media site. However, after a secession of promotional tours across the United States in support of the EP, Vanderloos would decide to part ways with the original group to pursue a more refined pop-rock direction. =Addition of Fenton and Supernatural EP (2012 ‚Äì present)= After a brief hiatus at the end of 2011, A Million Pieces announced the addition of frontman Graham Fenton to the band. Vanderloos would meet Fenton after a chance encounter at an LA restaurant where Fenton worked as a singing waiter. On hiatus from his lead role in the Grammy award-winning Broadway show Jersey Boys (hosted in Las Vegas), Fenton seized the opportunity to front A Million Pieces. The full lineup would fall into place as Lucas Gordon (drums) and Brad Crowell (bass) formed a close friendship with Fenton and Vanderloos in 2012, all sharing early influence from 1980s era rock bands Queen and Genesis. In November 2012 the band announced through a series of audio clips that they would be releasing a new EP entitled Supernatural pending a January 22, 2013 release date. In May 2013 the band announced the signing of a Publishing Deal with corporate conglomerate Stampede/Cashmere at Stampede Music Publishing. Musical style and influences * A Million Pieces blends a mix of several different genres together including pop, American rock, post-Britpop, Synthpop and show tune music. Band members have stated chief influences in Queen and Genesis as well as various Synthpop groups popular in the 1980s including Hall and Oates and Tears for Fears. * Fans and critics have compared A Million Pieces to contemporary acts including The Killers, Muse, Maroon 5 and Foster the People. =Current members= *Graham Fenton- Lead Vocals (2011‚Äìpresent) *Peter Vanderloos- Guitar, vocals (2009 ‚Äì present) *Lucas Gordon- Drums, vocals (2011 ‚Äì present) *Brad Crowell- Bass, vocals (2012 ‚Äì present) =Former members= *Morgan Freed- Vocals (2009‚Äì2011) *Jerrod Bettis- Drums (2010‚Äì2011) *Stephen Soss- Piano (2010‚Äì2011) *Ryan Brown- Bass (2010‚Äì2012) Discography * A Million Pieces EP (2011) * Laserbeams- single version (2011) * Supernatural EP (Pending 2013) Interviews and press *BMI Indie Spotlight: A Million Pieces *College News: A Million Pieces Releases First EP *The Sound Alarm: Six Picks With A Million Pieces *Property of Zack: Showcase A Million Pieces ReferencesExternal links golfwang.com *A Million Pieces official Facebook *A Million Pieces official Twitter *A Million Pieces official Soundcloud *A Million Pieces official Youtube *A Million Pieces official Flickr *A Million Pieces official website Category:American pop music groups Category:Rock music groups from California Category:Electronic music groups from California Category:Musical groups established in 2009 Category:Musical quartets Category:Music of Los Angeles ","title":"A Million Pieces"},{"id":"38200112","text":"Ebba Hentze (25 September 1930 ‚Äì 20 May 2015in.fo - Ebba Hentze dey√∞) was a Faroese writer of children's books and a poet and translator.

Regular subjects of Klausner's monologues include pets, television, film, musical theater, current events, American politics, what is happening on Twitter, and who she considers worthy of inclusion in a list known as the \\"Redhead Hall of Fame\\", using each topic as a platform for comedic improvisation and performance. Notable guests who have appeared on How Was Your Week include David Rakoff, Joan Rivers, Michael Ian Black, Jon Ronson, Patton Oswalt, Martha Plimpton, Ana Gasteyer, Kurt Loder, Retta, Eddie Pepitone, Chris Parnell, Mo Rocca, Jim Gaffigan, Carole Radziwill, Todd Oldham, Sandra Bernhard, Tom Scharpling, Andrew McCarthy, Mike Birbiglia, and Carrie Brownstein, among others. History Klausner created How Was Your Week in early 2011 after being encouraged to start a podcast by comedian Patton Oswalt via Twitter. She looked for format inspiration by listening to comedy broadcasts such as The Best Show on WFMU with Tom Scharpling and WTF with Marc Maron. In 2011 Rolling Stone named How Was Your Week as #4 on their list of ten best comedy podcasts. The first live recording of the show took place October 20, 2011 at The Bell House in Brooklyn, New York, and featured Ted Leo, Fred Armisen, Paul F. Tompkins and Billy Eichner.

Completed in 1910, construction was prompted by the erection of a dam downstream. The bridge was closed to automobile traffic in 1971. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in December 2012. Design and location The Upper Twin Falls Bridge is a single-span, pin-connected, camelback, through-truss bridge. It crosses the Menominee River about north of Iron Mountain, Michigan. The bridge is the only known example of its type in Michigan and one of two in Wisconsin, however the other is not in its original location. History=Construction= The Twin Falls Power Dam, seen here under construction, prompted the construction of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge. In the early 1900s, the Peninsula Power Company planned to build the Twin Falls Power Dam on the Menominee River. Upstream was an existing bridge which would be flooded by construction of the dam and the filling of its reservoir. This prompted the construction of a new bridge. The Upper Twin Falls Bridge was designed by M. W. Torkelson of Wisconsin. Construction of the bridge took place from 1909 through 1910 and cost $5,106, paid for equally by Dickinson and Florence counties. Gilbert Vilas Carpenter supervised construction. The bridge's earthen approach causeways were built for $7,500, paid by the Twin Falls Land Association. Material for the Wisconsin approach was obtained from a borrow pit on the Wisconsin side and transported to the site by side-dumping flatcars on narrow gauge railway. The dam was completed in 1912. =1920s to present= Gilbert Carpenter died in World War I following a torpedo attack en route from Cuba. In his honor, the Carpenter Monument was erected at the north end of the bridge and dedicated on Memorial Day, 1923. The memorial was partially funded by the Dickinson County Road Commission (DCRC) and its inscribed bronze plaque was provided by the Michigan State Highway Department. In the early 1930s, the Upper Twin Falls bridge carried US Highway 2 (US 2) and US Highway 141 (US 141). In 1934, a new bridge was built about a mile downstream and US 2 and US 141 were rerouted over the new span. The Upper Twin Falls Bridge closed to automobile traffic in September 1971. Ownership of the bridge and connecting roads was transferred to the DCRC and the Town of Florence. Robert Christensen, Michigan's coordinator for the National Register of Historic Places, opined in early 2013 that the bridge survived only because it had been bypassed by the other bridge. Around 2000, the county road commission began considering the removal or restoration of the bridge. However, the commission could not afford removal. One argument in favor of removal came from pontoon boat owners as the vessels are unable to pass underneath the bridge. The nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012. The nomination was reviewed by the Michigan Historic Preservation Review Board in May 2012 and by the Wisconsin Historic Preservation Review Board in August. Both groups supported the nomination, with unanimous support from the Wisconsin board. The nomination made use of a previous draft nomination produced by the Wisconsin Historical Society. After their approvals, Robert Christensen forwarded the nomination to the National Park Service in Washington, DC. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2012. It is the first site nominated by both Michigan and Wisconsin. As a result of the listing, it is hoped by local groups that funding for restoration may become available. According to Jim Harris, the DCRC superintendent of operations, there is no expectation of ever reopening the bridge to automobile traffic.

The company was founded in 2003 and has offices in the US and Jerusalem, Israel.  History  The magnetic coil technology used by Brainsway's devices, called the \\"H coil\\", emerged from research done in the late 1990s and early 2000s at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) by Abraham Zangen, Roy A. Wise, Mark Hallett, Pedro C. Miranda and Yiftach Roth. Most coils used in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provide a shallow magnetic field that affects neurons mostly on the surface of the brain, delivered with coil shaped like the number eight. The H coil provided magnetic fields deeper in the brain, and devices using them provide what is called \\"deep TMS\\". The H-coil was patented by the NIH in 2002, and the procedure whereby the H-coil was applied to TMS became known as Deep TMS. BrainsWay was founded in 2003 in Delaware by Uzi Sofer and Avner Hagai, together with David Zacut and they set up a subsidiary in Jerusalem, and obtained an exclusive license from the NIH for patent it filed on the H coil. By 2006 the company had conducted animal studies at Weizmann Institute of Science and had run its first clinical trial assessing safety, at Tel Aviv University. In early 2007 BrainsWay executed an initial public offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, raising for a market cap of . In 2010 Brainsway announced plans to list shares of the company's stock on the Nasdaq exchange but withdrew them in June. In January 2013, BrainsWay received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and from Health Canada to market its deep TMS device in the United States and in Canada as a treatment for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Evidence to support this use is tentative as of 2013 no high quality evidence is available. In August 2020, BrainsWay received FDA clearance for its deep TMS device for use in smoking addiction. The device has also previously been cleared by the FDA using an H1-coil for major depressive disorder and H7-coil for OCD.

In 1958, his firing by United College gained national attention. In raising questions about the security of academic freedom and tenure in Canada, Crowe‚Äôs case became a catalyst in solidifying the work of the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) in defending academic freedom and ensuring scholarly rights for academic staff in Canada.Horn, Michiel. Academic Freedom in Canada: A History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1998. Academic career Crowe began his academic studies at United College (now the University of Winnipeg) in 1938. He enlisted in the army during World War II; attaining the rank of captain. Upon returning from military duty in Europe, Crowe studied at University of Manitoba (honours degree), and later pursued graduate studies at University of Toronto (M.A.) and Columbia University (Ph.D.). In 1950, he was hired at United College. In 1951, he was awarded tenure and was later promoted to associate professor in 1956. Controversy The events that led to his controversial dismissal began in 1958 when United College Principal Wilfred Lockhart obtained, by mysterious means, a letter written by Professor Crowe to his colleague, William Packer. In that letter, Crowe had expressed concern with the religious and academic environment at United College and the worrying prospect of a Conservative victory in the upcoming federal election. Lockhart raised the letter to the College‚Äôs Board of Regents. Professor Crowe was subsequently fired on the grounds that the letter demonstrated his incompatibility with the \\"avowed purposes\\" of the College and his lack of respect and loyalty to the administration. Crowe objected to his dismissal by arguing, among other things, that the letter was private in nature and its reading by Principal Lockhart was unauthorized. Crowe‚Äôs termination prompted local and national concern about academic freedom and the status of tenure in higher education. Kenneth McNaught, Stewart Reid, and Richard Stingle announced they would resign in protest.McNaught, Kenneth. Conscience and History: A Memoir. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1999. Crowe‚Äôs dismissal, along with public concern about the affair, prompted the Canadian Association of University Teachers to step in by forming an ad hoc committee of enquiry‚Äîthe first such committee established by CAUT, which was formed in 1951. In 1959, the final report of the CAUT investigation was delivered by University of Toronto law professor Bora Laskin and University of Saskatchewan economist Vernon Fowke. The \\"Fowke-Laskin Report\\" concluded that Crowe‚Äôs dismissal was \\"an unjust and unwarranted invasion of the security of academic tenure.\\" \\"Report on the Crowe Case,\\" Canadian Association of University Teachers, CAUT Bulletin, 7:3 (1959)p. 46 The report further determined that the Board of Regents mishandled the complaint against Professor Crowe, violating natural justice, due process, and academic freedom. The release of the Fowke-Laskin report compelled the Board of Regents to reinstate Professor Crowe. However, the Board refused to reinstate his colleagues‚ÄîMcNaught, Reid, and Stingle‚Äîwho had resigned in support of Harry Crowe. In protest, Crowe and twelve other faculty resigned from their positions at United College. Among them were: Michael Oliver, Fred Harper, Walter Young, Margaret Stobie, Roman R. March, G.E.

Riley in 1974, which is used to distinguish radio galaxies with active nuclei based on their radio luminosity or brightness of their radio emissions in relation to their hosting environment. Fanaroff and Riley noticed that the relative positions high/low surface brightness regions in the lobes of extragalactic radio sources are correlated with their radio luminosity. Their conclusion was based on a set of 57 radio galaxies and quasars that were clearly resolved at 1.4 GHz or 5 GHz into two or more components. Fanaroff and Riley divided this sample into two classes using the ratio of the distance between the regions of highest surface brightness on opposite sides of the central galaxy or quasar to the total extent of the source up to the lowest brightness contour. Class I (abbreviated FR-I) are sources whose luminosity decreases as the distance from the central galaxy or quasar host increase, while Class II (FR-II) sources exhibit increasing luminosity in the lobes. This distinction is important because it presents a direct link between the galaxy's luminosity and the way in which energy is transported from the central region and converted to radio emission in the outer parts.  Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FR-I)  These sources are brighter towards their central galaxy or quasar and become fainter toward the outer extremities of the lobes (also called edge-darkened). The spectra here are steepest, indicating that the radiating particles have aged the most. Jets are detected in a large majority of FR-I galaxies, and these hosts also tend to be bright, large galaxies often located in rich clusters with extreme X-ray emitting gas. As the galaxy moves through the cluster, the gas can sweep back and distort the radio structure through ram pressure. VLA map of the FR-I galaxy 3C 449 at 1465 MHz.

Life and work Lady With Swans (marquetry screen, in the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne et Contemporain de Strasbourg) His father was a notary. At the age of twelve, he was enrolled in drawing classes and received encouragement to make art a career from his uncle , a painter. A scholarship he received in 1882 enabled him to study in D√ºsseldorf, Munich and Berlin. While in Munich, he met Martin von Feuerstein, a painter of sacred art, who introduced him to the Ott Brothers (glass makers) in 1887. After executing several projects for them in Strasbourg and completing his military service, he returned to B≈ìrsch, but found little work. By chance, he befriended , a politician and writer who painted in his spare time and became a major supporter of Spindler's efforts.Amis du Cercle de Saint-L√©onard: Biography and appreciation of Spindler. In 1893, Spindler and his friend Joseph Sattler began Les Images Alsaciennes, a journal they published until 1896. This enabled Spindler to establish a workshop in Saint- L√©onard (a district of B≈ìrsch) in 1897. Next came the Revue Alsacienne Illustr√©e, published from 1898 to 1914. Both journals were influential in promoting Alsatian culture. Also in 1893, he discovered marquetry and strove to apply it as a painting technique, rather than decorative ornamentation. He worked with equal facility in many mediums; posters and books, glass, boxes and trays, wood paneling and, most significantly, inlaid furniture for interior decoration. He also worked in collaboration with others, such as L√©on Elchinger (1871-1942, pottery) and Jean-D√©sir√© Ringel d'Illzach (sculpture).

It was built along a pilgrimage route from the churches on Lake Constance to Einsiedeln Abbey. The Loretto Chapel was built in 1763-65. A year after the chapel was completed three sisters moved from Schussenried Abbey in Germany to the new Abbey. The Abbey's farms and private donations supported the residents and allowed it to grow rapidly and by 1778 there were 52 sisters living there. The unique longitudinal main building grew organically through several expansion projects. Following the 1798 French invasion, the creation of the Helvetic Republic and then the Canton of St. Gallen in 1803, the Abbey went into decline. Under the Republic and the new Canton they lost many of their farms and were sometimes forced to billet troops. It rebounded between 1846-76 under the leadership of the matron Gertrude H√ºsler from Steinhausen and confessor Benedict Frey from Wettingen Abbey. By 2000 there were 18 nuns living in the Abbey, under the Bishop of St. Gallen.

RAF Full Sutton was still in use as an operational Royal Air Force station, when in 1958 permission was obtained from the Air Ministry and appears to have been organised entirely by the British Racing and Sports Car Club. It would appear that the BRSCC organised four race meetings at the Yorkshire track. The first meeting took place in April, when it snowed, causing Jim Clark to go off in the Scott-Watson Porsche; the car narrowly missed a flag marshal who had not been warned by his fellow flag marshal of the impending danger as he departed. The meeting on 27 September saw a six- race programme for Formula III racing cars amongst others. All races were over 10 laps, with the exception of the saloon cars who raced over five laps instead, and the main event of the day, started at 16:00 with a Le Mans start and ran over 16 laps for the Sports Racing Cars of unlimited capacity. In this no less than 17 Lotus Elevens were entered, all powered by 1098cc Coventry Climax engines with the exception of Innes Ireland‚Äôs example which had a 1460cc Climax power unit. It was the first airfield track in England to be lapped at more than 100 mph by a sports car, the car in question being a Jaguar D-type entered and owned by Border Reivers and driven by Jim Clark. The calculations in respect of the fastest lap were made in the pub after the meeting and initially showed a speed in excess of 120 mph, but when the alcohol and euphoria wore off the true figure was established. The circuit was Britain's longest at 3.2 miles (5.1 km), however the circuit was some distant from centres of population and when Rufforth Circuit became available the BRSCC moved there for convenience.Peter Swinger, ‚ÄúMotor Racing Circuits in England : Then & Now\\" (Ian Allan Publishing, , 2008) References Category:Motorsport venues in England Category:Sports venues in the East Riding of Yorkshire ","title":"Full Sutton Circuit"},{"id":"38200639","text":"Kiyasovo () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Kiyasovsky District of the Udmurt Republic, Russia.

This flag was traditionally awarded to a troop in the British Colonies that had the largest number of King Scouts on 30 September in each year. In those years the number of colonies in the British Empire was quite a considerable number and no other troop in the Colonies could emulate that achievement. From 1993 up to 2006, Dharmaraja Scouts won the Island Merit Flag for being the Best Scout Group in Sri Lanka, consecutively.

It was heard by the Constitutional Court on May 10, 2005, with judgment handed down on June 13. Langa CJ, Moseneke DCJ, Madala J, Mokgoro J, O'Regan J, Sachs J, Skweyiya J, Van der Westhuizen J and Yacoob J presided. W. Trengove SC (with him K. Pillay) appeared for the applicant; PF Louw SC (with him JA Babamia) appeared for the respondent. The applicant's counsel was instructed by the Women's Legal Centre, Cape Town. The respondent's attorney was the State Attorney, Johannesburg. The first question addressed in this case was ambit of the courts' duty to develop the common law in accordance with the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights as intended in section 39(2) of Constitution. The purpose of that section, it was determined, is to ensure that the normative value system created by the Constitution permeates the common law. The courts are bound by section 39(2) not only when contemplating a radical departure from existing common-law rules, but also when an incremental development thereof in issue. The second and more central question was the constitutionality of the common-law principles underlying the vicarious liability of an employer for the delictual acts of his employee. The court distinguished between the principles themselves and their application. The traditional notion of the application of these principles as matter of fact untrammelled by considerations of law or normative principles was found to be constitutionally untenable. The application of the principles was accordingly in need of development to conform to the normative framework of the Constitution. This meant no more than that a court must bear in mind constitutional norms when deciding whether the case before it is in principle one in which the employer should be held liable. The principles themselves, as embodied in the present two-stage test, focusing on the subjective question as to the state of mind of the employee, together with the objective question as to whether there is a sufficient link between the conduct of the employee and the employer's enterprise, were found to be consistent with constitutional norms. The particular question to be decided in this matter was the liability of the Minister of Safety and Security for criminal acts committed by police officers while on duty. The police officers in question had been found guilty of rape. To determine whether or not the Minister was vicariously liable, the court used a two-stage common-law test for liability, developed in light of the normative framework of the Constitution. This test, drawn from the case of Minister of Police v Rabie1986 (1) SA 117 (A). had both a subjective stage (evaluating the state of mind of the employee) and an objective stage (considering the link between the delict and the employer's enterprise). The policemen, subjectively viewed, were found to have acted in pursuit of their own objectives. Their conduct, however, was sufficiently linked to their employment as policemen, particularly when viewed against the background of the Constitution. The Minister, accordingly, was held to be vicariously liable.  Facts  The applicant, who was brutally raped by three uniformed policemen who had given her a lift, applied for leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court against a judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) which held that the respondent was not vicariously liable for the policemen's conduct. The applicant based her appeal on three arguments: * that the SCA had erred in its application of the common-law test for vicarious liability; * that, if it had not, the test had to be developed as intended in section 39(2) of the South African Constitution; and * that the State in any event had to be held directly liable for its failure to protect her from harm. The applicant argued that the SCA's conclusion‚Äîthat the principles of vicarious liability did not render the respondent liable‚Äîwas inconsistent with the Bill of Rights, and that the principles of vicarious liability therefore had to be developed to render the respondent liable.  Judgment  O'Regan J, in her decision for a unanimous court, held that the overall purpose of section 39(2) of the Constitution was to ensure that the common law was infused with constitutional values. This normative influence had to extend throughout the common law, not only to instances in which the existing rules were clearly inconsistent with the Constitution. The obligation section 39(2) imposed on the courts was extensive, therefore, and required them to be alert to the normative framework of the Constitution not only when some startling new development of the common law was in issue, but in all cases in which the incremental development of the rule was in issue.Para 17. The protection of the applicant's fundamental rights (to security of the person, dignity, privacy and substantive equality) were found to be of profound constitutional importance. It was also part of the duties of every police officer to ensure the safety and security of the public and to prevent crime. These, noted O'Regan J,Para 18. were constitutional obligations affirmed by the Police Act.Act 68 of 1995. O'Regan J held further that, if the principles of vicarious liability were regarded through the prism of section 39(2) of the Constitution, it became clear that to characterise their application as a matter of fact, untrammelled by any considerations of law or normative principle, could not be correct. The effect would be to sterilise the common-law test for vicarious liability and to purge it of any normative or social or economic considerations. Given the clear policy basis of the rule, as well as the fact that it was developed and applied by the courts themselves, such an approach could not be sustained under the new constitutional order. The principles of vicarious liability were imbued with social policy and normative content; their application would always prove to be difficult and require the drawing of what could be troublesome lines.Para 22. The principles of vicarious liability and their application had therefore to be developed to accord more fully with the spirit, purport and objects of the Constitution. This did not mean anything more, O'Regan J stressed, than that the existing principles of common-law vicarious liability had to be understood and applied within the normative framework of the Constitution, and the social and economic purposes which they sought to pursue. This implied that the court had to decide whether the case before it was of the kind that should, in principle, render the employer liable. Whether the principles of vicarious liability themselves required development beyond an acceptance of the normative character of their provenance and application was a different matter.Para 23. O'Regan J proceeded to investigate the common-law principles of liability. She cited the test in Minister of Police v Rabie, which focused both on the subjective state of mind of the employees and the objective question of whether or not the deviant conduct was nevertheless sufficiently connected to the employer's enterprise. This test, she noted, citing examples from England and Canada, was very similar to that employed in other jurisdictions. This test contained both a factual assessment (the question of the subjective intention of the perpetrators of the delict) and a consideration raising a question of mixed fact and law: that is to say, the objective question of whether or not the delict committed was \\"sufficiently connected to the business of the employer\\" to render the employer liable. The objective element of the test, approached with the spirit, purport and objects of the Constitution in mind, was found to be sufficiently flexible to incorporate constitutional as well as other norms. It required the court applying it to articulate its reasoning for its conclusions as to whether there was a sufficient connection between the wrongful conduct and the employment. Thus developed, the application of the test was not at odds with the constitutional order.Paras 44-45. It was possible, O'Regan J continued, for an employee at the same time to commit a delict for his own purposes, and neglect to perform his duties as an employee. It was clear, in the present case, that the delict for which the applicant sought to hold the respondent liable was the rape, and that the rape had been a deviation from the policemen's duties. They were, however, simultaneously omitting to perform their duties as policemen.Para 48. As to the first leg of the test, O'Regan held that, obviously, the three policemen did not rape the applicant upon the instructions of the respondent; nor did they further the respondent's purposes or obligations when they did so. They were indeed, subjectively viewed, acting in pursuit entirely of their own objectives, not those of their employer.Para 50. As to the second leg of the test, O'Regan J held that there were several important facts that pointed to the closeness of the connection between the conduct of the policemen and the business of their employer: # The policemen all bore a statutory and constitutional duty to prevent crime and protect the members of the public. That duty also rested on their employer, and the policemen had been employed to perform that obligation. # The policemen had offered to assist the applicant, and she had accepted their offer, thus placing her trust in them. The police were constitutionally obliged to protect the public and to prevent crime. In determining whether or not the Minister was liable, the importance of the constitutional role entrusted to the police, and of nurturing confidence and public trust in the police in order to ensure that their role was successfully performed, had to be kept in mind. O'Regan J found that it had been objectively reasonable of the applicant to place her trust in the policemen.Paras 51-52. # The conduct of the policemen had constituted both a commission and an omission: the brutal rape of the applicant and the failure to protect her from harm respectively. \\"In my view,\\" wrote O'Regan J, \\"these three inter-related factors make it plain that viewed against the background of our Constitution, and, in particular, the constitutional rights of the applicant and the constitutional obligations of the respondent, the connection between the conduct of the policemen and their employment was sufficiently close to render the respondent liable.\\"Para 53. It was decided, accordingly, that the respondent was vicariously liable to the applicant for the wrongful conduct of the policemen, and that the issue of whether or not the respondent was directly liable to the applicant did not arise. Leave to appeal was granted.Paras 57-59.

Service in World War II Although only 17 years of age at the outbreak of World War II, he claimed he was 18 and joined the 33rd Fortress Company, Royal Australian Engineers. He transferred to the AIF as a Corporal, later becoming a Sergeant. He was sent to Singapore in May 1941 and was at Kluang on the Malay Peninsular when Japan entered the war. The Australian troops, aided by British and Indian, were to hold the line against the Japanese advance. The Japanese strategy was to land south of the allied positions, causing a continual retreat for the allies. Iliffe was wounded in the leg by shrapnel shortly before the unit made it back to Singapore. He was being treated at an unofficial hospital in the Singapore Town Hall when he heard that the British were due to surrender the following day. He and several others made it to the docks and managed to steal some food supplies and a 16-foot boat. They sailed for three nights across open sea, and soon after landing on an island were found by a group of Dutch soldiers. One of the last to board a Dutch evacuation ship, he was transported to Perth and later Melbourne.

Prior to his work there had been no commercially viable desalination process that involved continuous flow; plants had to be stopped and emptied of accumulated salt from time to time, such as when a passenger liner using desalination was in port. Silver performed a thermodynamic analysis (now known as \\"Second Law Analysis\\") showing that reverse osmosis and \\"multi-stage flash\\" were the optimal processes for purification of water. As reverse osmosis technology was less advanced in the mid-20th century he designed multi-stage flash equipment, of which the first operational large-scale installation was in Kuwait. Early life He was born in Montrose, Angus on 13 March 1913 the son of Alexander Clark Silver and his wife, Isabella Simpson. He was educated at Montrose Academy. He studied Natural Philosophy (Physics) at Glasgow University graduating MA in 1932, BSc (1st class honours) in 1934 and gaining his doctorate (PhD) in 1938 for studies in gaseous combustion and subsequently was awarded a D.Sc in 1945 for further research work whilst in Industry. Career From 1936 to 1962 he worked in Industrial Research and Design. His first post (1936 to 1939) was in ICI's Explosives Division. For the duration of the Second World War he was Head of Research for G & J Weir in Glasgow. Here he became an expert in desalination whilst working with the Admiralty. After the war he worked consecutively for the Gas Research Board, Federated Foundries Ltd, John Brown Land Boilers Ltd then back to G & J Weir in 1956 as Chief of Research and Development and becoming Director in 1958. After the Second World War, he worked to redesign coal-burning fireplaces which were used in most homes and offices across the United Kingdom. His analysis of the heat balance of these fireplaces resulted in new designs that saved tons of coal and helped reduce air pollution. Silver redesigned the marine distillers and developed the Multi-Stage Flash desalination process without which arid countries such as in the Middle East would have inadequate water supplies to this day. He gained international stature and recognition from his role as the father of the modern desalination industry. Due to his work it is now practical to build desalination units far more efficient in energy consumption, and 15 times larger in capacity, than was possible before his developments. In 1962 he moved to academia and became Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Heriot-Watt University. In 1964 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Hugh Bryan Nisbet, John Ronald Peddie, Frank Bell and William Harold Joseph Childs. In 1967 he moved to Glasgow University to take up the James Watt Chair of Mechanical Engineering and Thermodynamics. He retired in 1979. In 1967 he was awarded a CBE. For his contribution to desalination Silver was awarded the UNESCO Science Prize in 1968, the first ever awarded. In 1980 he was elected a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Engineering In 1982 he won the Water Supply Improvement Association's Lifetime Achievement Award for his work bringing clean water to many arid countries.World Water (journal) vol 7 p.106 Personal life In 1937 he married Jean McIntyre Bruce (d.1988) and they had two sons. He was passionate about Scottish language and literature not only of the Doric tradition of the North East, but also of Gaelic. He was a poet and a playwright. His play 'The Bruce' was published by the Saltire Society in 1986 subsequently broadcast by the BBC Radio and put on at the Edinburgh Festival. A one-act play 'The Picture' was put on in London and is still popular with many amateur companies. A collection of his poems 'Conflict and Context' has been published by Chapman magazine. He was a prodigious writer to the newspapers and his thoughts on a wide range of topics could be seen regularly appearing in the letters columns of Scotland's national press. Silver was an ardent Scottish Nationalist standing for the SNP as a candidate in the 1979 election in the Craigton constituency of Glasgow in the 1979 General Election. He died on 21 April 1997.

He wrote The Gold Mines of the World as well as autobiographical and travel works of a philosophical turn. He was a member of the Eugenics Society and published To- day and To-morrow: The Testing Period of the White Race (1926) in which he surveyed the races of the world and argued that the white race was being out- bred by other races and its purity being eroded through inter-breeding with other races. He won awards for his collection of stamps of the Transvaal and in 1940 jointly won the Crawford Medal of the Royal Philatelic Society, London, for his book on the postage stamps of that province. Early life Eildon Hills near Melrose James Curle was born in Melrose, Scotland, on 18 October 1870, one of eleven children.Curle, J. H. (1922) The Shadow-show. 11th edition. London: Methuen. p. 31. His father was also James Curle and his mother was Marion Passmore Whyte Newlyn.James Herbert Curle Scotland Births and Baptisms, 1564‚Äì1950. Family Search. Retrieved 23 March 2019. The family lived in the south of Scotland at the foot of the Eildon Hills. He was educated at a preparatory school in Worcestershire but did not attend a public school due to \\"an overcharged nervous system\\".Curle, The Shadow-show, pp. 20‚Äì21. In 1885 he travelled to Australia in the care of a physician whose passage had been paid by Curle's father. The physician drank the brandy from Curle's flask, attributing its disappearance to \\"evaporation\\" and, according to Curle, much of the rest of the alcohol on the ship. Curle arrived in Australian at the age of 14 and after visiting relatives and staying in \\"the bush\\", visited his first gold mine at Ballarat. He visited Tasmania before returning to Scotland in 1886.Curle, The Shadow-show, pp. 21‚Äì23. Later in 1886 he travelled to South Africa, visiting the Transvaal and Natal before returning to Scotland where he spent two years at the University of St Andrews before matriculating at Trinity Hall, University of Cambridge.Curle, The Shadow-show, pp. 23‚Äì27. Career Cover of the first edition of The Gold Mines of the World, Waterlow, London, 1899. In 1891, Curle arrived in Witwatersrand, South Africa. In 1894 he was appointed mining editor of the Johannesburg Star but he left that job fairly soon after to work in mine evaluation which he did during his extensive travels. In the course of his work he acquired a great deal of financial insight into mining companies that enabled him to become wealthy by trading shares on the stock exchange.\\"J.H. Curle of The Curle Collection\\", Wilhelm J. Verwoerd, The South African Philatelist, Vol. 90, No. 2 (April 2014), Whole No. 923, p. 40.Curle, J. H. (1926) To-day and To-morrow: The Testing Period of the White Race. 2nd edition. London: Methuen. p. 1. In 1899 he published The Gold Mines of the World which had a second edition in 1902 and a third in 1905.Curle, Mr James Herbert (geology). S2A3 Biographical Database of Southern African Science. Retrieved 23 March 2019. He also wrote a number of autobiographical and travel works of a philosophical turn such as The Shadow-show (1912) and This World of Ours (1921). According to his obituary, he travelled with a large map of the world on which he recorded his journeys which for a prolonged period of time averaged 50,000 miles per annum. The writer Manfred Nathan, who worked with Curle on The Star, described him as \\"a tall man with thick eye-brows and a sort of stammer\\" who was taciturn and did not encourage confidences. His obituary in The Eugenics Review, described him as \\"very much a Border Scot\\", shy, deflecting praise with a joke, an agnostic, of strong views but personally generous. Tall at , he was, however, not robust and his extensive travels were the result of determination and an inherently roving nature. Racial views Curle was a member of the Eugenics Society\\"J. H. Curle\\", R.C., The Eugenics Review, 1943, pp. 26‚Äì27. and in 1926 published To-day and To-morrow: The Testing Period of the White Race in which he surveyed the races of the world and argued, as was common in eugenicist circles before the Second World War, that the white race was being out-bred by other races and its purity being eroded through inter-breeding with other races.Curle, To-day and To-morrow, 2nd. pp. 97‚Äì98.

Life Burgeff was born in W√ºrzburg, the son of Hans Burgeff, university professor of botany. He first studied \\"General Science\\" () at the University of W√ºrzburg, but afterwards studied the history of art in Stuttgart and in T√ºbingen. In 1951 he transferred to the K√∂lner Werkschulen, where he studied sculpture and modelling with Prof. Ludwig Gies and was nominated \\"master student\\" (Meistersch√ºler) in 1956. Independent from 1957, Burgeff quickly became known for his predominantly religious works, such as church portals, altar tables, crucifixes and statues of saints. In 1968 he received the Sculptor's Advancement Prize of the city of Cologne and the nomination to the professorship of sculpture and bronze modelling at the K√∂lner Werkschulen (as successor to Kurt Schwippert), a post he held until 1988. For the \\"public effectiveness\\" () of Burgeff's figures, reliefs and plaques, the memorial tablet in M√ºnster for Cardinal H√∂ffner of 1993 is especially representative. Other works of the artist are to be found, among other places, in the sculpture park of Schloss Moyland and at Cologne Cathedral. Among the many distinctions and honours awarded to Burgeff was honorary membership of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Medaillenkunst (\\"German Society for Medal Art\\"), conferred upon him in 2001. Burgeff died in Lohmar and was buried in Weibern in the Eifel. His gravestone, representing two wheatsheaves, was made by his last master student, Ulrich G√∂rtz.

Fish Lass is a Geordie term for a fishwife. The Cullercoats Fish Lass was a term for a fishwife from Cullercoats, a small fishing village near the mouth of the Tyne. The Cullercoats Fish Lass was popular with locals and tourists alike. Jean F Terry wrote, in 1913, \\"The Cullercoats fishwife, with her cheerful weather-bronzed face, her short jacket and ample skirts of blue flannel, and her heavily laden \\"creel\\" of fish is not only appreciated by the brotherhood of brush and pencil, but is one of the notable sights of the district\\". Performances The song was very popular in its day and was probably performed by the composer, Ned Corvan, in drag. Almost all of Corvan's works are examples of the traditional dialect of Tyneside (known as Geordie) in the mid-19th century. Ned Corvan, as he was known, was a popular music hall performer, renowned for concerts and venues \\"of the free and easy type...not specially noted for their refinement\\".

It was heard in the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) on March 7, 2006, with judgment delivered on March 17. Mpati DP, Farlam JA, Navsa JA, Cloete JA and Van Heerden JA presided. RT Williams SC appeared for the appellant and HM Raubenheimer SC for the respondent. The appellant's attorneys were the State Attorneys, Cape Town and Bloemfontein. The respondent's attorneys were Smith & De Jongh, Bellville; Milton de la Harpe, Cape Town; and Honey Attorneys, Bloemfontein. The case was an appeal from a decision in the Cape Provincial Division by Thring J. A subsequent application to appeal it further to the Constitutional Court was rejected. The central issue was the vicarious liability of an employer for the delictual acts of its employee: in particular, the liability of the Minister of Safety and Security for criminal acts committed by police officers while off duty. An off-duty policeman had pursued persons who had attempted to rob him and shot an innocent third party, rendering him tetraplegic. To determine whether or not the Minister was vicariously liable for the damage thus caused, the court used the two-stage test for vicarious liability, asking first whether or not the employee's acts were committed solely for his purposes and, if so, secondly, whether there was a sufficiently close link between the employee's acts and the employer's purposes and business. The court found that, in pursuing the would-be robbers, the policeman had acted in both his own interests and those of the South African Police Service (SAPS). He had intended to perform police duties. The first question was thus answered in the negative, which made consideration of the second question unnecessary. The Minister, therefore, was found to be vicariously liable to the third party. The policeman's non-adherence either to the rules of criminal procedure or to police standing orders did not excuse the Minister from liability.  Facts  An off-duty policeman, Constable Lionel Siljeur, while pursuing persons who had attempted to rob him, shot the respondent, Allister Roy Luiters, an innocent third party, thereby rendering him a tetraplegic. It appeared from the evidence that, in pursuing the would-be robbers, Siljeur had used his firearm in a manner which was contrary both to the standing orders of the SAPS and to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act.Act 51 of 1977. The respondent succeeded in an action for damages in the High Court on the basis that, at the time of the incident, Siljeur had been acting within the course and scope of his employment as a member of the SAPS, making the appellant vicariously liable to the respondent.  Argument  It was argued on appeal, on behalf of the appellant, that Siljeur had not been acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the incident, and that the appellant therefore escaped liability to the respondent.  Judgment  Navsa JA, for a unanimous SCA, held that, in determining whether or not an employer is vicariously liable for acts committed by an employee in the course of a deviation from the normal performance of his duties, two questions have to be answered: # Were the wrongful acts perpetrated solely for the purposes of the employee? This question requires a subjective consideration of the employee's state of mind at the time of the incident and is purely a question of fact. # If so, was there nonetheless a sufficiently close link between the employee's acts and the purposes and the business of the employer? This inquiry raises questions of both fact and law.Paras 14, 19. As to the first question, Navsa JA held that, in pursuing the would-be robbers, Siljeur had acted in both his own interests and the interests of the SAPS. Although he personally had been subjected to an attempted robbery, he must have been mindful of his authority as a policeman in pursuing the robbers, especially given that he was using his service pistol. The court a quo had therefore found correctly, in Navsa JA's view, that Siljeur's intention at the time of the incident had been to perform police duties.Paras 20, 23, 26. The fact that Siljeur had adhered neither to the police standing orders, nor to the Criminal Procedure Act, in his pursuit of the would-be robbers, did not, the court decided, excuse the appellant from liability.Para 28. The appeal, therefore, was dismissedPara 29. and the decision in the Cape Provincial Division, in Luiters v Minister of Safety and Security, confirmed.  Appeal  The Minister duly appealed to the Constitutional Court, which dismissed the application on the basis that there were no prospects of success on appeal.

Langa CJ, Moseneke DCJ, Madala J, Mokgoro J, Nkabinde J, O'Regan J, Sachs J, Van Der Westhuizen J, Yacoob J and Kondile AJ presided, handing down judgment on November 30. W. Trengove SC and RT Williams SC appeared for the applicant, and HP Viljoen SC and HM Raubenheimer SC for the respondent. The State Attorneys, Cape Town, represented the applicant; the respondent's attorneys were Smith & De Jongh, Bellville. An application for leave to appeal against a decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal, the case revolved around the question of the vicarious liability of an employer for the delictual acts of an employee: in casu, the liability of the Minister of Safety and Security for criminal acts committed by police officers while off duty. An off-duty policeman had pursued persons who had attempted to rob him, and had in so doing shot an innocent third party. The Minister was held to be as liable for the delictual acts of an off-duty policeman who placed himself on duty as for those of an on-duty policeman. The Minister was therefore vicariously liable to the third party, one Allister Roy Luiters. Once an off-duty police officer puts himself on duty, the court held, that officer, for the purposes of vicarious liability, is in same legal position as the police officer ordinarily on duty.  Facts  The applicant (the Minister) sought leave to appeal against a decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in which it upheld a decision of the High Court to the effect that the State was liable in damages for the injuries sustained by the respondent when he was shot by a policeman in the employ of the South African Police Services (SAPS) who, although off duty, had placed himself on duty by embarking on a pursuit of suspects. He did so on the basis of his contention that the common-law rules governing vicarious liability ought to be developed so as to distinguish between off-duty policemen who placed themselves on duty and on-duty policemen.  Judgment  Langa CJ, for a unanimous Constitutional Court, dismissed the application on the basis that there were no prospects of success on appeal.Paras 32, 35, 37. The court determined also that, once off-duty police officers are found, on the facts of a particular case, to have put themselves on duty, as they are empowered and required to do by their employer, they are for the purposes of vicarious liability in exactly the same legal position as police officers who are ordinarily on duty.Para 35.

The Ativ Tab was announced on August 29, 2012 at IFA 2012, incorporates a dual-core 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, and runs the Windows RT operating system. Despite the mixed reception that its Windows RT operating system has received in comparison to Windows 8, the Ativ Tab itself received positive reviews for its lightweight design, its ability to use USB peripherals, and its overall performance for a first generation Windows RT device. While the Ativ Tab was released in December 2012 in the United Kingdom, its release in Germany and the United States was cancelled due to the lukewarm reception and unclear positioning of Windows RT.  Hardware  The design of the Ativ Tab is relatively similar to its Android-based counterparts (such as the Galaxy Note 10.1)built using a mixture of plastic and glass. A micro HDMI port, MicroSD slot, and a full-size USB port are incorporated into the design, as well as a volume rocker, power button, and headphone jack located on the top. A physical Windows button is located directly below the screen. A charging port and dock connector are located on the bottom. The Ativ Tab uses a IPS display at a resolution of 1366x768. The tablet is available with either 32 GB or 64 GB of internal storage.  Availability  The Ativ Tab was originally scheduled for a release in the United Kingdom in November 2012 alongside its Windows Phone 8 counterpart, the Samsung Ativ S, but was delayed into mid-December. The release of both devices was eventually held on December 14, 2012. In January 2013, Samsung announced that it had cancelled the American release of the Ativ Tab, citing the unclear positioning of the Windows RT operating system, \\"modest\\" demand for Windows RT devices, plus the effort and investment required to educate consumers on the differences between Windows 8 and RT as reasons for the move. Mike Abary, senior vice president of Samsung's U.S. PC and tablet businesses, also stated that the company was unable to build the Ativ Tab to meet its target price pointconsidering that lower cost was intended to be a selling point for Windows RT devices. Samsung has also reportedly planned to pull the Ativ Tab from Germany and other unspecified European markets for similar reasons.  Reception  Whilst demoing the device at IFA, TechRadar praised the Ativ Tab's \\"crisp\\" screen, lightweight design, and the ability to expand its functionality and storage with its USB port and MicroSD card slot. However, it was also said that while its processor was relatively responsive, it \\"certainly wasn't in the same league as the Galaxy Note 2.\\" Anandtech said that despite not being the best substitute for an actual notebook due to the lagging performance of ARM-based processors and the rushed nature of the OS, the Ativ Tab was \\"well executed\\" for a first- generation Windows RT device. The tablet's relatively \\"snappy\\" performance, battery life, and lightweight design were regarded as positive aspectsdespite considering the design itself to be \\"nothing particularly new or exciting.\\" The Qualcomm APQ8060A chipset used in the Ativ Tab was also judged as being the best processor for Windows RT so far, noting that its performance was sufficient and \\"surprisingly competitive\\" in comparison to the chipsets used in competing Windows RT devices.

The textiles of Sumba, an island in eastern Indonesia, represent the means by which the present generation passes on its messages to future generations. Sumbanese textiles are deeply personal; they follow a distinct systematic form but also show the individuality of the weavers and the villages where they are produced. Internationally, Sumbanese textiles are collected as examples of textile designs of the highest quality and are found in major museums around the world, as well as in the homes of collectors. Since the early 1900s, the Dutch were exporting textiles from Sumba. Today, great numbers of textiles are still produced by a relatively small number of women, mainly from the eastern coastal districts of Sumba. These textiles are made not only for export, but also for trade among local people for ritual use, where by custom the process of ikat was forbidden. Significance and symbolism Hinggi Since textiles are the products of Sumbanese women, they are viewed as tangible representations of the female element of the bipartite universe. In Sumba, this male-female dynamic is encapsulated in the notion of the Highest Being, who is both the Father Sun and Mother Moon, as well as the Creator or Weaver of human life. The Sumbanese believe individuals are able to acquire the special powers and qualities of certain creatures when textiles displaying such motifs are worn.Adams M.J., System and Meaning in East Sumba Textile Design: A Study in Traditional Indonesian Art, New Haven, Southeast Asian Cultural report Series 16, Yale University. 1969:29 Although the appropriate clothes for Sumbanese men and women are different, Sumbanese textiles are seen collectively as a female component of their cosmos. The textiles are both clothing and the currency of traditional ceremonial exchange. Many fine-folded textiles must be presented at each marriage as part of a counter-payment for a bride wealth paid in horses, buffalo, and gold, and at each funeral as a sign of mourning and later also a counter-payment for animals that were contributed for slaughtering. In marriages, the textiles are symbolic and represent dowry from the woman's family, the wife-givers, who are ritually superior on ceremonial occasions. The textiles are a prominent part of reciprocal gift for male dowry, such as metal, buffalo, and ivory from the man's family, whose burden in gift-giving is heavier because of the inferior status of the wife- taker to that of the wife-giver.Maxwell R. (1990), Textiles of Southeast Asia; Tradition, Trade and Transformation. Oxford University Press Australia. The textiles are also traded or given to show that a contract is binding, as a kind of \\"interest payment\\" to request for more time to discharge a debt, and as a gesture of gratitude or reciprocation. Within these contexts, the textiles are counted; their collective value is estimated on the basis of materials, workmanship, design, and their relative worth in relation to the livestock traded for it, if any. These estimations value indigo-dyed textiles more than those made with commercial dyes, value hand-spun thread more than store-bought thread, and value labor-intensive techniques of supplementary ikat-dyeing more than simpler and faster designs.Hoskins, Janet. In the Realm of the Indigo Queen Dyeing, Exchange Magic, and the Elusive Tourist Dollar on Sumba. Chapt 4 in What's the Use of Art? Asian Visual and Material Culture in Context. Honolulu, Hawaii: University of Hawaii pp. 115 Weaving and dying techniques Young woman from Kambera with a piece of cloth tied and ready for dying, 1931 The dominant weaving technique for the hinggi is ikat of the warp, although supplementary weaving of both the warp and weft are sometimes used. For more important textiles, the ends are finished with a tapestry weave. The process of dyeing the pattern of a particular piece of cloth involves first setting the warp up on a frame, which gives the length of the cloth. In most cases, one end mirrors the other, and the left side of a panel mirrors the right side. Two identical panels are dyed, woven, and then joined. Because the technique is very labor-intensive, the designer, usually the weaver, generally does the setting out and dyeing simultaneously such that two textiles are constructed at the same time. Women's skirts, the lau, are a plain weave with a variety of decorative techniques added, including embroidery, the application of shells and beads, the supplementary weave of the weft, and, occasionally, ikat. Imagery Hinggi detail of a gecko The identifiable creatures that appear on royal Sumbanese textiles include animals of ritual sacrifice, such as cocks or chickens, as well as deer with spreading horns. Shrimp and lobsters can also be depicted and symbolize rebirth‚Äîshrimps because they shed and replace their shells, and lobsters because they can regenerate their limbs in a process of renewal. As such, shrimp and lobsters are symbolic of a ruler's powers.Adams M.J., System and Meaning in East Sumba Textile Design: A Study in Traditional Indonesian Art, New Haven, Southeast Asian Cultural report Series 16, Yale University. 1969 Hinggi Geometrically patterned Ikat woman's dress of thick cotton. Sumba, mid 20th century Hinggi are large blankets decorated with warp ikat used for adat exchanges and as men's clothing. They are usually made in pairs; one cloth is wrapped around the hips, and the other is thrown over the shoulder. When designed for nobility, the textiles are usually larger and dyed with red and indigo colors to indicate the statuses of both the wearer and the giver. In the past, only nobles had the right to use and wear such textiles. These textiles were seen only in festivals, where they were worn by nobles, their family members, and retainers as a sign of power and wealth, which was concomitant with the wealth of society.Adams, M.J. Syst 1972 The designs are often based on local animals, such as horses, roosters, deer, snakes, fish, and prawn. Other specifically Sumbanese images include the skull tree and the mamuli, a gold ornament that is also a rank indicator. Foreign symbols, such as dragons from Chinese ceramics and lions from the Dutch coat of arms, are sometimes incorporated in these textiles. Lau Lau Hada from about 1900, Indianapolis Museum of Art No 33.682 Lau are the tubular skirts worn by women. The same symbols that appear on a man's hinggi reappear on the women's skirts, but the range of techniques used extend beyond ikat alone. These techniques include designs worked by a supplementary weave warp, embroidery, the application of beads and shells, and, occasionally, tufting with supplementary yarns. The figures used in these textiles appear in light-colored yarns on plain backgrounds of dark blue, red, brown, or black. Lau pahudu are skirts worked with supplementary warp. Lau hada are skirts worked with beads and shells. They are also known as pakiri mbola, which means \\"at the bottom of the basket\\" and refers to the way they are carried when bought as a part of marriage gifts. An Indonesian gallery, Threads of Life, has archived various images of these skirts. Tiara Tiara are narrow textiles. The wider version, Tiara haringgi, is used as a shoulder cloth. A narrow version is used as a headband.

On August 12, 2011, Son was trying to attend a hearing on Cu Huy Ha Vu's appeal against Vu's seven-year jail sentence. The next morning, on August 13, 2011 at around 11:30am policed blocked the road around his home in Thanh H√≥a Province, and deliberately caused him to fall from his motorcycle as he was coming home. Four police officers dragged him into a police car. The arrest happened during the 2011 crackdown on Vietnamese youth activists which included 17 other Vietnamese youth activists.  2013 Conviction  On January 9, 2013, a trial was held by the People's Court of Ngh·ªá An Province for 14 democracy activists, including Paulus Le Van Son. All of them were sentenced to 3‚Äì13 years in prison on charges of subversion. During the court case, Paulus Le Son was accused of participating in a training of Viet Tan , a US-based pro-democracy organization to establish democracy and reform Vietnam through peaceful and political means. During the trial, Son was the only defendant of the 14 not to have acknowledged any wrongdoings. During the trial, a large number of police were deployed around the court, with police detaining a number of other bloggers who attempted to attend the trial.  International Response  Reporters Without Borders quickly condemned the arrest in 2011 and called for his immediate release. In a statement, the organization states that \\"We are appalled by the brutality of Son's arrest, which has all the hallmarks of a police kidnapping\\" Following the 2013 trial, Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, condemned the arrest and calls for the \\"convictions to be squashed immediately\\". He states \\"The conviction of yet more peaceful activists is another example of a government that is increasingly afraid of the opinions of its own people. Instead of imprisoning critics, the Vietnamese government should be honoring them for their efforts to address the myriad problems facing the country that the government itself has also identified.\\" Following the 2013 trial and conviction, Reporters Without Borders quickly emerged and stated that it is \\"appalled at the groundless verdict handed down yesterday by a court in northern city of Vinh\\" and that it is the position to prove his innocence.

She had a very strong personality and significantly influenced the way her husbands, first ƒêuraƒë II Bal≈°iƒá and second Sandalj Hraniƒá Kosaƒça, and her son Bal≈°a III governed their realms. Jelena encouraged them to resist Venetian encroachment on territory belonging to Zeta, the medieval Serbian state ruled by ƒêuraƒë II and then by Bal≈°a III after ƒêuraƒë II's death. She is also known as a writer in epistolary literature, particularly her correspondence with Nikon of Jerusalem, a monk in the Gorica monastery on Lake Skadar (Montenegro). Her three epistles are part of the Goriƒçki zbornik (Cyrillic: –ì–æ—Ä–∏—á–∫–∏ –∑–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫), a medieval manuscript collection.  Name  Kru≈°evac Fortress Keep Jelena's nickname was \\"Lady Lena\\" (–ì–æ—Å–ø–æ—í–∞ –õ–µ–Ω–∞) or the \\"Learned one\\" (–£—á–µ–Ω–∞). In some English sources she is referred to as Helen. She was referred to as Jelena Lazareviƒá because of her father's noble family. Based on her marriage to ƒêuraƒë II Bal≈°iƒá she was referred to as Jelena Bal≈°iƒá, while because of her marriage to Sandalj Hraniƒá she was sometimes referred to as Jelena Bal≈°iƒá-Hraniƒá or Jelena Hraniƒá. In a Venetian document from 1409 she is referred to as \\"Magnifica Domina Elena\\".  Life = Family = Jelena was born in 1365 or 1366 as the third daughter of Princess Milica of Serbia and Lazar of Serbia. Her mother belonged to the Nemanjiƒá dynasty, while her father was the founder of the Lazareviƒá dynasty. He created Moravian Serbia, the largest and most powerful state to emerge from the ruins of the Serbian Empire. Hence, Jelena was a member of the highest Serbian aristocracy. She was born in Prilepac and spent her childhood in Kru≈°evac, where she lived until she married her first husband, ƒêuraƒë II Bal≈°iƒá, in 1386. She had one child with him, a son named Bal≈°a III who was born in 1387. Bal≈°a III had three children, a son whose name is not known and two daughters, Jelena and Teodora. His son died at a very young age in 1415. In 1424, Bal≈°a's daughter Jelena married Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça and became the mother of Queen Catherine of Bosnia and Vladislav Hercegoviƒá. = Marriage to ƒêuraƒë II Bal≈°iƒá = Donji Brƒçeli Monastery in Bar was founded by Jelena Bal≈°iƒá Jelena married ƒêuraƒë II Bal≈°iƒá in 1386 or 1387. After this marriage the suzerainty of Lazar of Serbia was accepted in most if not all of Zeta. When the Sultan sent an army to invade the lands of ƒêuraƒë II at the beginning of 1392, Jelena travelled to the Republic of Ragusa (nowadays Dubrovnik) to get out of harm's way. On 1 June 1392, the senate of Dubrovnik decided to send a galley to take her to the city. ƒêuraƒë was captured by the Ottomans in October 1392 and was released only once he agreed to cede Scutari to them. He managed to recapture the town in 1395 but subsequently sold it to the Venetians, together with the surrounding fortresses. Jelena was firmly opposed to the pro-Venetian policy of ƒêuraƒë II and his sale of Scutari and other towns to the Venetians. She did not like the Venetians because they obstructed the contacts between the Zetan Orthodox Metropolitanate and the Patriarchate of Peƒá, cut off Orthodox monasteries around Lake Skadar from the incomes that they were legally entitled to, and engaged in an aggressive trading policy, which significantly reduced Zeta's earnings. Even before the First Scutari War, she was in a dispute with the Venetians over the jurisdiction of the Zetan Orthodox Metropolitanate over the Orthodox churches around the river Bojana and the Church of St. Peter in Scutari. The reign of 16-year-old Bal≈°a III began in April 1403 when ƒêuraƒë II died of the injuries suffered in November 1402 at the Battle of Tripolje. In this battle ƒêuraƒë II supported Stefan Lazareviƒá in an attempt to protect the throne of Serbian Despotate from ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. Jelena had a significant influence on the way Bal≈°a III governed Zeta. Because he was a minor when he inherited the throne, she actually governed Zeta as his regent. In a dispute between the Venetians and the Zetan Metropolitan bishop appointed by the Patriarchate of Peƒá, Bal≈°a III followed her instructions and protected the ancient rights of the Serbian church. = First Scutari War = Wall of Ulcinj, the seat of ƒêuraƒë II In 1405, Bal≈°a III, supported by Jelena, launched a ten-year war against Venice. At the beginning of the war, Bal≈°a managed to capture the whole Scutari region except for the Scutari fortress. The Venetians offered a 2,000-ducat reward for anyone able to kill both Bal≈°a and Jelena. When the Venetians in return captured Bar, Ulcinj and Budva, three of the most important ports of Zeta, Bal≈°a and Jelena fled from Ulcinj to Drivast Castle. In 1409, Jelena decided to travel to Venice to negotiate peace in person. At the end of May, she arrived in Dubrovnik but had to wait for almost two months because her hosts warned her that there were Napolitan galleys in the Adriatic Sea. On 9 July 1409, while she was still waiting in Dubrovnik, Venice purchased the entire Dalmatian coast from Ladislaus of Naples for 100,000 ducats. The Kingdom of Naples was not a threat to Venetians anymore. By gaining the Dalmatian coast, Venetians further increased their influence and power in the region of the Adriatic Sea, which made Jelena's negotiating position difficult. When she finally arrived in Venice at the end of July, she was financially broken because of her long voyage. The Venetians had to support her with three ducats a day during negotiations which lasted for the next three months. On 26 October 1409, a year-long peace agreement with the Venetian doge, Michele Steno, was signed without territorial changes for any of the parties. Jelena traveled back to Zeta through Dubrovnik where she received 100 ducats worth of presents. Although both she and the Venetian representative swore on the Gospel to respect the truce, in reality there was no peace. = Marriage to Sandalj Hraniƒá = Blagaj, the court of Sandalj Hraniƒá where Jelena went to live after she married him When Ladislaus of Naples sold his rights to the Kingdom of Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice and retreated from the Balkans in 1409, many local nobles allied themselves with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and accepted Ostoja as the King of Bosnia. This seriously weakened the position of Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá, a Grand Duke of Bosnia, whose niece Katarina was a second wife of Sandalj Hraniƒá, a Grand Duke of Hum. In such circumstances Sandalj decided to ally with emperor Sigismund in mid 1411 and to establish closer connections with Sigismund's important ally Stefan Lazareviƒá. In December 1411 Sandalj divorced his wife Katarina and married Stefan's sister Jelena at the end of the same year. Jelena married Sandalj because she wanted to strengthen the position of her son. With this marriage Sandalj, the most dangerous enemy of Bal≈°a III, became his stepfather and protector. Although it spoiled Sandalj's relations with Hrvoje, it also strengthened traditionally close relations with the Lazareviƒá family. Although Jelena was in her forties, Sandalj hoped they would have children and in 1413 deposited some money at a transactional account with the city of Dubrovnik for the child they would eventually have. Jelena went to live with her husband at his court in Blagaj in Herzegovina while Bal≈°a remained as the only governor of Zeta. In his second marriage, concluded in 1412 or at the beginning of 1413, Bal≈°a III married Bolja, a daughter of Koja Zaharia who was a Lord of Sati and Dagnum in Albania.Albanolo≈°ki institut u Pri≈°tini 1968 p. 125: \\"Poznato je takoƒëe da se Bal≈°a III krajem 1412 ili poƒçetkom 1413 godine o≈æenio u drugom braku ƒáerkom Koe Zaharije\\" In 1413 Bal≈°a issued a charter to the church dedicated to Saint Nicholas he built in Praskvica Monastery together with his mother Jelena. Sandalj had a court in Novi (modern day Herceg Novi) where he spent some time every year, usually in winter and spring. Beginning in 1424, Jelena spent a good part of the year at this court, accompanied by her sister Olivera. Dubrovnik At the beginning of February 1426 a special ceremony was dedicated to Jelena and Sandalj in Dubrovnik when they attended the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), the city's patron saint. Jelena intended to be buried in the church she would build in Dubrovnik. Initially, Dubrovnik was interested in accepting her wish on the condition that she help them take control of Novi, its rival in salt-trading. That is why Dubrovnik proposed to Sandalj to build an Orthodox church and home for old and sick people in 1434. Sandalj died in 1435 before he replied to their proposal. He was succeeded by his nephew Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça who was a son of Sandalj's brother Vukac. After Sandalj's death Jelena did not interfere in the governing of the realm previously controlled by her husband but went to live at the seaside, probably in Novi. In September 1435 Jelena asked the Ragusans to allow her to build a church in Dubrovnik in which would be her grave. Since circumstances had changed after Sandalj's death, the Ragusans rejected Jelena's request although it was supported by her nephew, Serbian Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. They justified their refusal with the lack of the approval of the Pope. = Goriƒçki zbornik = The first page of Otpisanije bogoljubno. Three epistles she wrote to her spiritual adviser were included in the Goriƒçki zbornik (), a medieval manuscript collection. Today only one of them, known as the Otpisanije bogoljubno (), is preserved. Jelena wrote her will on 25 November 1442. Based on its text it can be concluded that she had her own library and that in 1441 she told her chancellor Doberko Mariniƒá to order a book cover. The book cover was made of silver and decorated with the image of Jesus. It was made by Andrija Izat, who was a famous goldsmith from Kotor. = Death = She first reconstructed the Church of St. George built by ƒêuraƒë II Bal≈°iƒá on Be≈°ka island on Lake Skadar and in 1439/1440 built as her endowment the Church of Holy Mother next to it. She was buried in its western vault, near the southern wall of the church. The purpose of her endowment was to be her crypt and to serve as the spiritual center which would continue the orientation of the Serbian culture toward Byzantine Orthodox spirituality in this historically last period of Serbian medieval statehood. In this way Jelena confirmed her loyalty to the tradition of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty and her father Prince Lazar in the period when she was able to make a political choice between Islam and militant Catholicism. Jelena's efforts had an additional dimension taking into consideration that her work is a testimony of the presence of the Byzantine hesychasm in the Serbian Despotate. The sacred bones of Jelena Bal≈°iƒá were placed in the new relic case made of stone after the Church of Holy Mother she built on Be≈°ka island was reconstructed in 2002 by the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral. By the decision of the 'Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral' in 2006 she was titled 'Blagovjerna' and named \\"Blagovjerna Jelena Lazareva Bal≈°iƒá\\".  Legacy  Jelena Bal≈°iƒá was praised as an extraordinary woman who preserved the power of the Bal≈°iƒá family during a very turbulent period. It is obvious that she had a strong personality probably similar to her mother, Princess Milica of Serbia. She managed to maintain the cultural heritage of the Kingdom of Serbia, and her writing has been evaluated highly. The literature award \\"Jelena Bal≈°iƒá\\" was established in 2007 by the 'Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral' and is awarded every two years. As of 2013, its laureates have been ƒêorƒëe Sladoje, ≈Ωarko Komanin, Ranko Jovoviƒá and Slobodan Rakitiƒá. = Legends = Legends incorrectly say that she was Jelena Obiliƒá, a widow of Milo≈° Obiliƒá. One of the legends about Jelena was recorded in Herzegovina. According to that legend Sandalj asked Jelena who was her favorite husband. Her reply was that she would give away both Sandalj and Bal≈°iƒá just to see Milo≈° Obiliƒá one more time. Sandalj was angered and Jelena had to run away from him. While she was on the way to Zeta, in some nettle, she gave birth to a boy who was a founder of Koprivica family (kopriva, \\"nettle\\"). Some of the preserved legends about Jelena include Queen Jelena's Bees (–ü—á–µ–ª–µ –∫—Ä–∞—ô–∏—Ü–µ –à–µ–ª–µ–Ω–µ/Pƒçele kraljice Jelene), Queen Jelena's Fishpond (–†–∏–±—ö–∞–∫ –∫—Ä–∞—ô–∏—Ü–µ –à–µ–ª–µ–Ω–µ/Ribnjak kraljice Jelene), White Stone (–í–∏—ò–µ–ª–∏ –∫–∞–º/Bijeli kam) and Queen Jelena's Mowers (–ö–æ—Å—Ü–∏ –∫—Ä–∞—ô–∏—Ü–µ –à–µ–ª–µ–Ω–µ/Kosci kraljice Jelene).

Due to the large number of characters that appear over the course of the story, the list is divided by species with the exception of major characters (chimaera, seraphim, or human), along with the respective novel they have appeared in: Daughter of Smoke and Bone or Days of Blood and Starlight.  Major characters  Karou: Karou is a seventeen-year-old Prague art student who speaks a variety of languages, has three bullet wounds on her stomach, and has blue hair that grows from her head. In Daughter of Smoke and Bone, she runs tasks for her foster father Brimstone by gathering the teeth of various creatures, including humans, and draws pictures of her chimaera guardians in her sketchbook. When she is in Marrakesh on a task, Akiva, a seraph, is about to kill her when he recognizes that she is truly Madrigal reborn. When Madrigal was killed, Brimstone gleaned her soul and made a new body out of a string of human baby teeth, creating the body of a human infant that he then raised as Karou. In the chimaera language, the word \\"karou\\" means \\"hope\\". In Days of Blood and Starlight, with Brimstone dead, Karou works for Thiago as the resurrectionist, as she is the only one left who truly knew the task. Zuzana: Zuzana is described by Karou as being like a rabid, tiny fairy in appearance. She is Karou's best friend in Karou's human form and Mik's girlfriend. She and Mik have a puppet act, but it is failing now as Zuzana lacks the patience to keep it up much longer. Karou often kept her secret errands from Zuzana, but after witnessing the death of Kishmish, Zuzana learned everything. In Days of Blood and Starlight, Karou sends Zuzana an e-mail that the latter takes to mean as a code for rescuing, but it is only when she gets to the chimaera hideout that she learns Karou never wanted to be rescued. First appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Brimstone: Brimstone is a chimaera with a ram's head, lion haunches, raptor feet, and reptilian eyes, with the rest being like a man's. He runs an otherworldly shop in which hunters and graverobbers give him teeth for wishes, although there are certain requirements for the teeth so that they can be used to create a proper body for resurrection. Having raised her from infancy, Brimstone is the closest thing to a father figure that Karou knows. When Madrigal was executed by Thiago, Brimstone gleaned her soul and fashioned her a new body of a human infant so that he could raise her. Joram personally kills Brimstone and so Karou has to take over the resurrection trade. First appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone and appears in flashbacks in Days of Blood and Starlight. Akiva: Akiva is a seraph and member of the Misbegotten, or the illegitimate sons and daughters of Emperor Joram. He is known among his people as \\"Beast's Bane\\" because of the amount of chimaera that he has killed. Madrigal helped him so that he did not die from an injury after a battle, and he came to love her. The two met in the temple of Ellai every night until Thiago found out and had Madrigal executed. When he spies Karou in Marrakesh, Akiva is about to kill her when she turns around and he sees in her eyes that she is truly Madrigal. In Days of Blood and Starlight, he kills his father Joram to help achieve the goal that he and Madrigal strove for. Due to his mother's Stelian ancestry, he has an unusually large amount of magic for a seraph. To stop Jael's army from hatching their evil plot, he plans to burn all portals from Eretz to the human world, but is too late. First appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Thiago: Thiago is a chimaera with wolf haunches and clawed fingernails, although he was originally stag-headed like his father. The son of the Warlord, he took over the chimaera cause when his father was killed. His gonfalon was a wolf's head with the words \\"Victory and vengeance\\" underneath. Thiago has just received from Brimstone when Karou first stumbles across the space underneath Brimstone's shop, and Karou accidentally disturbs him. He goes to attack her, but Brimstone saves Karou. Madrigal was originally his suitor, and when he found her with Akiva in the temple of Ellai, he had her executed. In Days of Blood and Starlight, Thiago has appointed Karou as the new resurrectionist and the two act as the Warlord and Brimstone. Thiago makes several advances on her, but she rejects them. He tries to rape her in the pit after killing Amzallag, Tangris, and Bashees, but Karou kills him and moves Ziri's soul to his body to make it look as if nothing had happened. Ten: Ten is a wolf-type chimaera that works personally for Thiago. In Days of Blood and Starlight, Ten is in charge with looking after Karou to make sure that she doesn't escape. Ten shows enthusiasm in this and wishes to begin resurrection work herself, although Karou denies her this right. When Bast says that Amzallag and the Shadows That Live were killed by Thiago, Karou runs into Ten on the way to the pit and gets attacked. However, Issa manages to overcome Ten and transfers her body to Haxaya's soul so that the fox-type chimaera can keep up a disguise so as not to arouse suspicion. Ziri: Ziri is described as being Madrigal's \\"little Kirin shadow\\", and was madly in love with her. Like Madrigal, he was Kirin (see Madrigal, below) and ended up being the last of his species to occupy his natural flesh. When Madrigal was beheaded, he is said to be the only chimaera who never cheered. After Karou came back and her true identity was discovered, he was forbidden from contact with her. However, when his party (led by Balieros) disobeyed orders and went to the Hintermost to save their people, he was the only survivor and managed to glean the souls of the others. The angels attacked him and he was badly hurt, so Karou healed him so that he could remain pure. After the death of Thiago, Ziri occupied the body of Thiago as Haxaya occupied the body of Ten to carry on the charade. First appears in Days of Blood and Starlight.  Chimaera  Issa: Issa is one of the Naja chimaera, meaning that she has a snake tail, the hood and fangs of a cobra, and clothes herself with snakes. She raised Karou, sharing the job with Yasri, and was believed to be killed with Brimstone and the others. However, Brimstone and Twiga killed her and Yasri and gleaned their souls, hiding them in different places. Issa's thurible went with Akiva, who gave it to Karou so as to resurrect the Naja. At first, Thiago is hesitant to allow Issa to remain there, as Naja do not have the wings that are needed by the chimaera army, but Karou talks him into keeping her, as she has resurrection experience. First appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Twiga: Twiga is one of Brimstone's assistants. He has a giraffe neck and spends the majority of his time cleaning teeth and banding the teeth together with silver for Brimstone's work. When Brimstone is to be killed, he requests that Issa, Twiga, and Yasri give up their bodies so that their souls can be gleaned and sent back to Karou. Twiga, however, refuses to leave his master behind and chooses instead to die with him. First appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Yasri: Yasri is Brimstone's cook. She has a parrot beak, but the rest appears to be human. In Days of Blood and Starlight, Issa tells Karou that Yasri raised her as much as the Naja did. She was believed to be killed with Brimstone and the others. However, Brimstone and Twiga killed her and Issa and gleaned their souls, hiding them in different places. Yasri's thurible awaits for Karou to regain in the rubble of the temple of Ellai where Madrigal and Akiva met every night. First appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Kishmish: Kishmish acted as Brimstone's messenger to Karou, sending her a note every time he wanted her to go on a mission for teeth. He is described as being like a crow with bat wings and a forked tongue. In the middle of Daughter of Smoke and Bone, Kishmish comes flying in at top speed on fire with his last note from Brimstone, requesting help. He dies in front of Zuzana as well as in front of Karou, so Karou is required to explain everything about the chimaera to Zuzana. Madrigal: Madrigal was Karou's original form. She was of the Kirin species, meaning that she has large bat wings on her back, gazelle horns, and gazelle-furred legs with hooves from the knee down. She was sought out by Thiago for being \\"pure\\", meaning that she had never been resurrected, although her true love lied with Akiva. Thiago found Madrigal and Akiva in the temple of Ellai and had Madrigal beheaded in a public display. After the event, Brimstone gleaned her soul and made her new body on a string of human baby teeth, meaning that she was reborn as a baby and raised by Brimstone. Karou's memories of Madrigal are in both Daughter of Smoke and Bone and Days of Blood and Starlight. The Warlord: The Warlord appeared briefly in flashbacks in Daughter of Smoke and Bone and Days of Blood and Starlight. The father of Thiago, he was established as the leader of the chimaera resistance during the war. He has the head of a stag but is otherwise human, and is still in his natural body. A thousand years ago he ignited the revolution of the chimaera in a brutal slave revolt. His gonfalon was stag antlers with leaves growing from them, symbolizing new growth. After the siege of Loramendi, The Warlord was personally killed by the emperor of the seraphim, Joram, and Thiago took over as the leader of the chimaera. Chiro: Chiro was Madrigal's foster sister, as her family took in Madrigal when she was orphaned. Chiro is a member of the Sab tribe of chimaera, meaning that they possess a jackal head, caracal haunches, and bat wings. She has a deep envy of her foster sister for being mostly human. When Chiro was killed in battle and Madrigal resurrected her to be exactly the way she was before, Chiro lashed out at Madrigal for keeping the jackal head. She first appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Amzallag: Amzallag was one of Karou's first resurrections, filled with iron filings for strength and size. He is happy with his body and carries on. When Karou reveals the truth of the cathedral where the souls of the women and children are kept, Amzallag begs Thiago to take them there and glean the souls so that he may see his family again. Thiago denies him this and later kills him at the pit. Karou manages to glean his soul, however, before it is too late. He first appears in Days of Blood and Starlight. Sveva: Sveva is the younger sister of Sarazal. She is of the Dama species of centaurid, based on the fallow deer. She believes herself to be the fastest chimaera alive, as she is the fastest Dama, and they are the fastest species of chimaera. She helps her older sister escape slavery and makes friends with the Dashnag boy Rath. First appears in Days of Blood and Starlight. Sarazal: Sarazal is the older sister of Sveva and is therefore of the Dama species as well. When she and Sveva are on the run, she gets an infection in her leg from chains being too tight, and Rath carries her while unconscious. When she wakes up in a Caprine village and sees his head, she lets out a scream that gives away their location. Akiva pretends, however, that the scream was just a bird and saves them. First appears in Days of Blood and Starlight. Rath: Rath is a Dashnag chimaera, meaning that he has the head of a saber-toothed tiger. He is an escaped slave that makes friends with Sveva and Sarazal when they are all slaves. When the three manage to escape, Rath meets up with the two Dama and offers to carry Sarazal so that they can make better progress. When Sarazal wakes up in a Caprine village, the first thing she sees is Rath's face. Terrified, she lets out a piercing scream. First appears in Days of Blood and Starlight. Bast: Bast is a cat-type chimaera whose soul is, according to Karou, \\"delicate\\" and \\"ill-suited to a soldier\\". Her original body had the head of a cat and the body of a slender woman. Karou resurrects her into a much more animalian body, more muscular with paws for hands and leopard haunches. She was one of the few chimaera who thanked Karou for the new body the resurrectionist constructed. Bast tells Karou that Thiago has killed Amzallag, Tangris, and Bashees and to go to the pit, and Karou is unsure whether Bast was a \\"conspirator or pawn\\" to Thiago. First appears in Days of Blood and Starlight. Razor: Razor is a member of Thiago's army and former Heth bone priest, meaning that he began with myrmecine traits. However, Karou had never seen a Heth before and ended up reconstructing him with a lion head. This caused him to attack her later, but Thiago threw him off. Every time he comes back from a mission he is carrying a bloody sack and has a smile on his face. First appears in Days of Blood and Starlight. Ixander: Ixander is a bear-type centaur whose soul is, according to Karou, like a meadow. He and Ziri sparred outside and began laughing about the events that took place, which causes Karou to assume that everyone is happier without her. The truth, as it turns out, is that Thiago ordered them not to interact with her. He was made to be more powerful and winged and was on the expedition to the Hintermost, where he died. His soul was gleaned by Ziri in time, however. First appears in Days of Blood and Starlight. Balieros: Balieros is a bull centaur. He is described as being very peaceable. He led an expedition with Ixander and Ziri. Thiago told the other chimaera that the expedition was to go to the Hintermost and help defenseless chimaera when in reality it was a raid, but Balieros took his group to the Hintermost instead. He was killed by seraphim there, but Ziri managed to glean his soul in time. First appears in Days of Blood and Starlight. Tangris and Bashees: Known as the \\"Shadows That Live\\", these two sisters are black, sphinx-like chimaera that have the ability to disguise themselves using the glamour and silently kill whole legions of angels in their sleep. When they stand with Karou, they are killed by Thiago, but Karou manages to glean their souls in time. They first appear in Days of Blood and Starlight. Haxaya: Haxaya is a fox-like chimaera that is known for her dark sense of humor. She and Madrigal were once friends, and now that Madrigal is Karou their relationship still seems to stand steady. When Ten is killed by Issa's snakes, Karou slits Haxaya's throat and moves her soul into Ten's body. She then acts like Ten until she, Karou, and the others can escape from the other chimaera. She first appears in Days of Blood and Starlight.  Seraphim  Hazael: Hazael is the brother of Akiva and Liraz and member of the Misbegotten. When Akiva declares that he is going to kill Joram to free the seraphim and chimaera from this war, Hazael stands with him. After Joram is killed and the other soldiers, led by Jael, attack Akiva, Hazael, and Liraz, one soldier stabs Hazael in the heart. His soul is not collected in time and he is doomed to death. First appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Liraz: Liraz is the sister of Akiva and Hazael and member of the Misbegotten. When Akiva declares that he is going to kill Joram to free the seraphim and chimaera from this war, Liraz stands with him. After Hazael is killed, Liraz distrusts Karou when she says that without a thurible of the soul she cannot bring him back. Liraz stands bold and does not let her gender define her among the other Misbegotten. First appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Razgut: Razgut is a fallen seraph that clung to Iz√Æl's back as part of the steep price of Iz√Æl's wish. He demands to know more about Karou, and when his demands are becoming increasingly harder to disobey, Iz√Æl flings himself off a cliff in the hopes of killing both of them. However, Razgut survives and goes back to Eretz to meet with the other seraphims, who make him whole again. Razgut then tells them what he knows about Karou as well as the chimaera secret of resurrection. First appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Joram: Joram is the emperor of the seraphim and father of the Misbegotten legion, his illegitimate children. These include Akiva, Hazael, and Liraz. His younger brother is Jael, leader of the Dominion. Joram was responsible for the destruction of Loramendi as well as the personal killing of The Warlord and Brimstone. In Days of Blood and Starlight he is killed by Akiva after stepping out of the bath in an attempt to bring about the end of war and peace in Eretz that Akiva and Madrigal dreamed of. He first appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Jael: Jael is Joram's brother-in-law and commander of the Dominion. He bears a scar across his face that interferes with his eating, drinking, and speech. When Joram is killed, Jael kills the next-in-line, Japheth, so that he can be the leader of all seraphim. Jael's plot is to get white gowns and harps for the seraphim to get the angels on their side and make the chimaera look like monsters for trying to stop them. He first appears in Days of Blood and Starlight. Japheth: Japheth is the legitimate son of Joram and the Crown Prince of the Empire of the Seraphim. When Akiva kills Joram, Jael kills Japheth in order to be the emperor of the seraphim. He first appears in Days of Blood and Starlight. Festival: Festival is the mother of Akiva. She is a Stelian, which are a race of seraphim that live in the Far Isles. When it was revealed that Joram killed her, Akiva's full rage ignited and he was able to kill the emperor. Though she was mentioned in Daughter of Smoke and Bone, she is not named until Days of Blood and Starlight.  Humans  Kaz: Kazimir, more commonly referred to as Kaz, is a resident of Prague and Karou's ex- boyfriend. Karou commonly uses low-ranking wishes to exact her revenge on him, and when Karou disappears in a wild flight, Kaz enjoys the media attention that comes with it. First appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Bain: Bain is a hunter and frequent visitor to Brimstone's shop. He receives high payment for his frequent visits and numerous teeth per visit, although Karou hates him for his means of acquiring teeth. He first appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Iz√Æl: Iz√Æl is a graverobber who pulled out his complete set of teeth for the highest possible wish, a bruxis. He wished for and was granted profound knowledge that drove him into madness. Razgut the fallen seraph rode on his back and pressured him to reveal more about Karou. Iz√Æl refused to the point of throwing himself off of a building to his death rather than succumbing to the wishes of Razgut. He first appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Mik: Mikolas Vavra, more commonly known as just Mik, is a talented Prague violinist and Zuzana's boyfriend. He helps Zuzana to find Karou in Days of Blood and Starlight and then stays with them for a short period of time before they are sent back. His violin amuses the chimaera. When Zuzana thinks that Mik will ask her to marry him, he tells her that there are still two tasks he must perform before that can happen. He first appears in Daughter of Smoke and Bone, but plays a larger part in Days of Blood and Starlight. Esther: Esther is one of Brimstone's human associates, and considered by Karou to be on the less vile side. She provides the information to Karou in Daughter of Smoke and Bone that all the portals in the world have been burned by seraphim.  Mythological  Nitid: Nitid is the main chimaera goddess. According to chimaera mythology, after her sister Ellai was raped by the sun, she shed tears that became the chimaera. Ellai: The chimaera goddess of assassins and secret lovers. It was in her temple that Madrigal and Akiva met every night, and it was in the ruins of her temple that Yasri's thurible was hidden away. According to mythology, she was raped by the sun. Zamzumin: According to seraphim mythology, Zamzumin was the last Gibborim, a race of hideous monsters. He became the ancestor and creator of the chimaera. The Godstars: The serephim believed that there were once a race of bright warriors who traveled from their far away world to engaged in a long war with the Gibborim. All but one hundred of them died but in the end they vanquished the Gibborim. These hundred were called the godstars, who were believed to bring light to the universe.

Construction commenced in December 1983 with the project being cancelled in June 1988. Following a feasibility study, contracts for pre-construction works were awarded in December 2012. The Government of New South Wales is currently running a Registration of Interest process, seeking market interest to construct, operate and maintain the proposed line. Route The proposed 34.9 kilometre line diverged from the Main South line at Maldon via a triangular junction and headed in a south-easterly direction over the Nepean River before crossing beneath the Hume Highway and Picton Road. It would then proceed to Wilton, over the Cordeaux River and through the four kilometre long Avon tunnel which was to be the longest rail tunnel in Australia before joining the Moss Vale - Unanderra line at Dombarton. The line was to be single track throughout with passing loops at Wilton, Cordeaux and Avon.\\"Maldon - Dombarton\\" Railway Digest July 1985 page 192 History The origins of the line can be traced back to a late 1970s proposal to construct a line from the Lithgow and Picton area coalfields to a new export coal loader at Port Kembla. Plans advanced to the stage of the Public Transport Commission calling for expressions of interest in constructing the new line's major engineering feature, the 12 kilometre Cordeaux tunnel in December 1977 before the plan lapsed. Following completion of the coal loader at Port Kembla in 1982 the idea of a rail link was revived and in September 1983 the Wran State Government announced the Maldon to Dombarton line would be constructed with completion expected in 1986. The line was to be electrified, but with 25 kV AC rather than the 1.5 kV DC system used on other New South Wales lines. The electrification would extend up the Main South line from Maldon to Glenlee Junction where the existing electrified network from Sydney ended and at Coniston Junction it would join the Illawarra line from Sydney that was in the process of being electrified. Construction commenced in December 1983. In June 1988 the incoming Greiner State Government cancelled the project, despite having committed to completing the line in the March 1988 election. It cited a massive cost blowout and that the 1990 southern and western coal exports were now being forecast at one-third of that forecast in 1982, although chose to ignore the increased tonnages that would result from the impending closure of the Balmain coal loader and Glebe Island grain terminal.\\"Maldon - Dombarton Abandoned\\" Railway Digest October 1988 page 370 In 2009 the Port Kembla Port Corporation released a pre-feasibility study into constructing the line.Maldon - Dombarton Rail Line Pre-Feasibility Study for Port Kembla Port Corporation Port Kembla Port Corporation In 2011 the Federal Government published a feasibility study into constructing the line.Maldon - Dombarton Rail Link Feasibility Study ACIL Tasman September 2011 This resulted in the Federal Government announcing that pre-construction activities would commence with contracts awarded in December 2012.Maldon to Dombarton Rail track on Track for the Illawarra Minister for Infrastructure and Transport 18 October 2011Maldon - Dombarton rail contracts awarded Illawarra Mercury 13 December 2012 Prior to winning the 2013 election, then Opposition Leader Tony Abbott, indicated that there was unlikely to be any further Federal Government funding for the freight line.No additional funding for Illawarra rail: Abbott ABC News 16 June 2013 In July 2014, Transport for NSW completed the planning and pre- construction design work, making the project ready to go ahead pending market interest and planning approval.

The NSW Government will use information obtained from the Registration of Interest to inform the future procurement process and the funding options available for implementing the Maldon to Dombarton Railway project. Legacy When the project was suspended some parts had already been completed.Dombarton - Maldon line NSWrail.net The following aspects were completed prior to suspension of works in 1988: *Earthworks and track work required for the junctions with the Main South Line and the Moss Vale to Unanderra Line at Maldon and Dombarton respectively *25 kilometres (approximately 70%) of earthworks and drainage for the rail formation, and ballast in some sections *Approach spans and abutments for the Nepean River bridge *Tunnel portals at the eastern and western ends of the Avon tunnel *Acquisition of land Duplication of the existing Moss Vale - Unanderra line from Dombarton to Coniston Junction as well as a bridge built to take the line over the old Princes Highway at Unanderra eliminating a level crossing had been brought into use. Electrification masts had also been erected and those between Unanderra and Coniston Junction were used when the Ilawarra line was electrified to Dapto in January 1993.

During the opening months of the revolution that would put an end to the Second Stadtholderless Period, Raap, together with other agitators like the journalist Rousset de Missy published pamphlets demanding the restoration of the stadtholderate in the provinces of the Dutch Republic that had abolished the office, and the appointment of the Frisian stadtholder William IV, Prince of Orange, in all provinces to this dignity, that should henceforth be hereditary in the male and female line. At the same time the agitators asked for more influence of the common people on the government that had hitherto been dominated by the Regents.Bicker, p. 144 More specifically, the petition he circulated demanded that militia captains would henceforth be directly elected; vacant public offices be auctioned off; and the guilds be restored in their old privileges.Van der Aa, p. 11 The agitators asked the Prince to come to Amsterdam to oust the city government, which he did on 2 September 1748. But instead of appointing new government members from the ranks of the democratic opposition the Prince selected the new city government from the old Regent class, be it from the Orangist faction that had been excluded during the Stadtholderless regime. This caused a rupture between Raap and the Orangist partisans, like Willem Bentinck van Rhoon. Likewise, the more radical democrats in the movement distanced themselves from him, because he was considered too moderate.Israel, p. 1075 His erstwhile popularity therefore turned into a deep hatred by the members of the Amsterdam mob, who had earlier revered him, by the time of his death in 1754.

History The name gained currency from \\"The Beehive\\", a draper's shop opened by Brewer and Robertson from October 1849 then J.V.B. Ryley from 1850 to 1858,John Venables Ball Ryley and William Moore were in partnership followed by Israel Simmons (ca.1831 - 9 June 1893) who ran the shop until 1886, when his business, with many others, failed. According to one reference it had a beehive motif on the glass door portrayed in gold leaf. Nearby tenants included Edmund Wright the well-known architect, William Ekins the gunsmith and James Allen's printing shop. The name is even older ‚Äì archivist G. H. Pitt found the name was chosen by the original owners to denote a busy trading centre. It had been a well-known landmark for fifty years in 1895 when what is essentially the present Beehive Buildings were built for the owner, Henry Martin to replace the antiquated structure. In the new design by George Klewitz Soward, four shops had frontages on King William Street and three facing Rundle Street, each 8 ft. (2.4 m) high, with jarrah floors and plastered walls and rear access and one shop 14 ft. (5.3 m) high, all having large plate-glass windows and nickel-plated columns. It was built three storeys above the pavement, and was Gothic in character, each gable finishing with crockets and a finial, and with open balustrades between them. At the main angle an ornamental turret was corbelled out, surmounted by a gilded beehive and bee and on the shaft of the turret the words 'Beehive Corner 1895' among foliage. The piers dividing the shopfronts were of Palmer granite. Sliding shutters were fitted to the windows facing King William Street, with a handsome iron verandah made by Fulton & Co. The sills of the windows facing Rundle Street were fitted with a small iron railing. The architects were English & Soward. In 1950 the prime corner section of the complex was sold to confectioner C. A. Haigh for his iconic shop (Haigh's Chocolates) after his leasing it for some 35 years. The neo-Gothic facade and prominent tourelle were refurbished in 1998 by the firm of Harrold and Kite. Place in popular culture For over a century, \\"Meet you at the Beehive Corner\\" has been a common phrase among Adelaideans when nominating a meeting- place in the city. Forgotten today, but once a familiar landmark, \\"Stump's Corner\\", directly across King William Street from the Beehive Corner, was an earlier rendezvous, named for Alfred Stump (1860‚Äì1925), a photographer who had a prominent sign on his studio. This corner hosted a succession of photographers: Melbourne Photographic Company to 1885, then (briefly) Henry Jones's \\"Children's Photograph Company\\", then in 1886 R.

The Juneau community of Thane was originally called Sheep Creek. Draining an area of about , it empties into Gastineau Channel. The valley formed by the river has a flat, gravel, trekking trail of , south of Mount Roberts. The Snettisham hydroelectric dam substation is situated on a trail spur. Sheep Creek Hatchery is located at the outflow. Geography Sheep Creek raises from the Sheep Mountain at an elevation of . Flowing from the water parting next to Grindstone Creek, the course of the main valley runs from southeast to northwest. About from its head, the stream makes a broad turn and in the lower , flows toward the southwest. The total length of the river valley is about . The upper and lower thirds of its course have steep grades, but the middle course is over a gravel flat sloping from elevation. Below the gravel flat, the tributary slopes are very narrow and there are no side gulches. Practically all of the drainage comes into the upper basin, where the walls of the valley are steep, though up to an elevation of about , they are covered with alder brush and grass, and are generally sodded nearly to the summit of the surrounding ridges. The latter are nowhere more than distant from the stream, though they rise to elevations of from . The generally smooth, but somewhat corrugated character of the slopes points to the molding action of ice, and the recency of glaciation is indicated by the shallowness of the rills, which collect the drainage from the mountain sides. The gravel trail is in length and provides access to the Mount Juneau Trail, the Granite Creek Trail and the Red Mill Trail and also many spur trails that lead to view locations and to mine ruins of historic value. The trail is wide and is in gravel formations and hence is not slippery as in the case of mud formed trails, and easy to access. Geology The formations of Gold Creek extend without interruption southeastward to Taku Inlet, but only the two outer divisions‚Äînamely, the black slate and the group of green stones and intercalated slate‚Äîare cut by Sheep Creek. On the ridge between Gold and Sheep creeks, the band of slates with their intrusive dikes of dark diorite is about across and this width is only slightly diminished in the vicinity of the Grindstone Creek divide, distant. The black slates contain dikes of dark diorite (altered gubbro), which follow the general trend of the formation. However, these rocks have not been greatly affected by vein waters. On the southeast ridge of Sheep Mountain and extending southeastward for is a somewhat irregular dike of the Coast Range-type of diorite. This rock has been impregnated to a certain extent by sulphides and locally contains stringers of quartz. This intrusion cuts a dike of the dark diorite. Flora and fauna Notable flora reported are berries on which the bears feed in the entire valley, wild geranium, columbine, Dodecatheon, or \\"shooting stars\\", Fritillaria affinis or \\"chocolate lilies\\", blueberry and salmonberry bushes. The fauna reported in the valley are: Mountain goats and black bear. During late summer, chum salmon (also called dog) Oncorhynchus keta fully clog the stream waters from bank to bank, and is popular location to witness the fishes and also do fishing in the stream. Sheep Creek Hatchery was established in 1980 with the objective of incubating about 40 million pink and/or chum salmon for use in commercial fisheries. The Coho Annex facility became part of this hatchery as the coho brood stock source. In the following years, this expanded into the Macaulay Salmon Hatchery, which is now the coho rearing facility.

By April 1 the battery was full but was not mustered into service until August 31. The men were principally residents of Benton, Washington, Madison, Crawford, Sebastian, Franklin, Johnson, and Sevier counties. The battery was stationed at Fayetteville, Arkansas during the period January‚ÄìApril 1863, and began moving to Springfield, Missouri on April 25. It arrived on 4 May and remained on duty there until September 21, including an expedition from Springfield into Arkansas and Indian Territory from September 7 to 19. They were near Enterprise, Missouri on September 15. The battery returned to Fayetteville on September 21 and remained there until March 1864, attached to District of Southwest Missouri, Department Missouri, during that time. In March 1864 it was placed under the command of 2nd Brigade, District of the Frontier, 7th Army Corps, Department of Arkansas, until January 1865, when it was placed under the command of Artillery, 3rd Division, 7th Army Corps, until February 1865. From then until it was disbanded, it was under the command of 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, 7th Army Corps.Dyer (1959), Volume III. p. 999 Service From 4 May to September 21, 1863, the battery was stationed at Springfield, Missouri, receiving while there guns and equipment. In September, Lieutenant Robert Thompson led one section of the battery in an expedition under Colonel M. Larue Harrison, through southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas, in pursuit of Colonel Coffee's command, then raiding in that section of country, and proceeded thence to Fayetteville, Arkansas. Under Captain Stark, the remaining two sections left Springfield on September 21, 1863, for Fayetteville, first marching to Greenfield, Missouri, under Colonel Harrison, who was then in pursuit of General Shelby. Moving then to Fayetteville, on October 20 one section of the battery under Colonel Brooks engaged the rebels at Cross Timbers, Missouri. The battery remained at Fayetteville until March 19, 1864, when, by order of Brigadier General Thayer, it marched to Fort Smith, Arkansas. On March 23 it joined the expedition to Camden, forming a part of Colonel Adams‚Äô brigade. It was present in the skirmish at Moscow, on April 13, with four guns in action, and relieved the 2nd Indiana battery, under fire from rebel artillery. Leaving Camden on April 28 with the retreating force under General Steele, it reached Little Rock on 3 May, and moved thence with the frontier division of the Army of Arkansas to Fort Smith. In October 1864, one section of the battery, under Lieutenant Mayes, was sent with other troops in pursuit of Colonel Gano, who had captured a supply train between Fort Scott and Fort Smith, making a forced march to Cabin Creek, north of Fort Gibson, where they came up with the retreating rebel force; however the enemy escaped without an engagement. The battery occupied Fort No. 2, at Fort Smith, until August 30, 1865, when it was mustered out.

It moved to Fort Smith on March 19, 1864, then participated in General Steele's expedition to Camden (March 23 ‚Äì May 3, 1864); it was near Prairie d'Ann from April 9 to 13, near Van Buren on April 12, near Camden on 15 April 15, near Poison Springs on April 18, and near Jenkins' Ferry, Saline River, on April 30. The group departed for Fort Smith on 3 May, arriving 16 May. It participated in the action at Prior Creek on September 18, 1864. It remained on garrison duty at Fort Smith and at Fort Gibson until it mustered out in August 1865. Mustered out of service The 1st Arkansas Light Artillery Battery mustered out on August 30, 1865.

Plot The death of his fianc√©e in a car crash so unnerves top surgeon Dr. Lee Cardwell that he moves to a rural community and becomes a general practitioner, but he attracts few patients. The local doctor calls him Dr. Socrates because he always has his head in a book of classics. Bank robber Red Bastian comes to him after he is shot in the arm during his latest caper. Lee treats Red, but is unwillingly to accept payment. Red, however, makes him take a $100 bill for his trouble. Later on, while on his way to another bank job, Red picks up hitchhiker Josephine Gray. While Red's gang is busy robbing the bank, Josephine tries to run away, but gets shot. She is treated by Dr. Socrates. At first, the police think that she is a gang \\"moll\\", but she is cleared and recuperates at the doctor's home. Red and his gang kidnap her and take her to their hideout, which the doctor had visited earlier on a medical call. He tells the police where to find the gang, but asks that they give him a chance to get Josephine safely away. He convinces the gang members that they need to be inoculated against an outbreak of typhoid fever, but what he really gives them is a knockout drug. He takes care of Red himself.

Geology  Kakepuku (2nd pink area from bottom right) is one of a line of volcanoes. Alexandra Volcanics are light pink on this map. Tokanui is just off the SE corner of the map. The 'Geology of the Waikato Area'http://www.gns.cri.nz/content/download/3472/19502/file/waik_text_lowres.pdf says, \\"The Alexandra Volcanic Group consists of several low-angle composite cones, including Karioi, Pirongia, Kakepuku, Te Kawa and Tokanui volcanoes, aligned southeast from Mount Karioi on the coast to Tokanui. They comprise about 55 km3 of mainly basaltic material erupted from at least 40 volcanic centres. The Alexandra Volcanic Group is the product of Late Pliocene to earliest Pleistocene back-arc volcanism, when both subduction-related basaltic magmas (Karioi, Pirongia, Kakepuku and Te Kawa) and intraplate alkalic basalts (Okete) were erupted. K-Ar ages range from 2.74 to 1.6 Ma, with the ages of the different magma series overlapping\\". It goes on to say Kakepuku is \\"composed mainly of basalt lava with minor tuff \\". Kakepuku was formed about 2.5m years ago. See also the geological map http://data.gns.cri.nz/geology/  History  Kakepuku was named by Rakataura, a Tainui tohunga. One version says it was in memory of the shape of his pregnant wife, Kahurere. In Maori legend, Kakepuku travelled north in search of his father, until he reached the Waipa plain and fell in love with Te Kawa, daughter of Pirongia and Taupiri Mountains. However, he had a rival in Karewa, who also stood nearby. The mountains fought, Karewa lost and, pursued by Kakepuku's rocks, fled into the Tasman Sea, now also known as Gannet Island. So Kakepuku remains guarding Te Kawa. DOC says, \\"Tainui settlement in the Kakepuku area began about 1550AD, although there were probably earlier people's present - notably Ngati Kahupungapunga (see history of Tokoroa).\\" It is in the NgƒÅti Maniapoto area (see also http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/ngati-maniapoto/1). Four pa sites are hidden under forest or regenerating bush.  Walking track  DOC says, \\"From the car park there is a new walking track to the summit.

Once at the top continue along a ridge through a fine remnant of original forest in the ancient crater and finally onto the summit itself (449 m, marked with a trig).\\"  Conservation  Kakepuku Mountain Conservation Project covers 198 ha including Kakepuku Mountain Historic Reserve (administered by DOC), adjacent Waipa District Council reserve and private land. The project was established in 1995 out of concern for the health of native bush on Kakepuku Maunga. The aim has been to reduce possum, rat and goat populations to levels where minimal impact on forest and native birds would occur. 30 North Island robins were reintroduced in 1999 and later the New Zealand falcon, weedy portions on the fringe of the mountain were replanted with native plants and tui and kereru are also present.

The concept was introduced by Swiss zoologist Heini Hediger in 1954, along with other space boundaries for an animal, such as flight distance (run boundary), critical distance (attack boundary), personal space (distance separating members of non-contact species, as a pair of swans), and social distance (intraspecies communication distance). Hediger developed and applied these distance concepts in the context of designing zoos. As the critical distance is smaller than the flight distance, there are only a few scenarios in the wild when the critical distance may be encroached. As an example, critical distance may be reached if an animal noticed an intruder too late or the animal was \\"cornered\\" to a place of no escape. Edward T. Hall, a cultural anthropologist, reasoned that in humans the flight distance and critical distance have been eliminated in human reactions, and thus proceeded to determine modified criteria for space boundaries in human interactions.

Seiberling Tires ad from 1922. In 1898 Frank A. Seiberling acquired an old strawboard factory in Akron, Ohio and founded the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (naming it after Charles Goodyear, the inventor of vulcanized rubber). He served as the company's president for 15 years when, in 1921 the company was refinanced and reorganized. Frank Seiberling and his brother Charles resigned from the company and founded a rubber and tire company bearing his name. The Seiberling Rubber Company was founded in 1921 in Barberton, Ohio. In only six years Seiberling rose from 330th to 7th place in the tire industry. During World War II, Seiberling supplied tires for heavy artillery pieces. Seiberling is also credited for inventing the Saw-Tooth Tread and the tire Heat-Vents. Seiberling Tire's advertising in the 1940s through the 1950s was famous for the brand's slogan of \\"A name you can trust in Rubber.\\" In the mid-1960s, Seiberling launched the SuperWideSport series, a bias-belted tire aimed to the Muscle Car market, booming at the time. The tire featured a whitewall on one side and a redline on the other, also common on the tire market at the time. The tire achieved relatively good sales being that Seiberling's Akron rivals had released good products to compete, including Goodyear's Polyglas, Firestone's Wide-Oval, Uniroyal's Tiger Paw and BF Goodrich's Radial T/A. The tire success did not go unnoticed and by the early-1970s the Big Three had some Seiberlings as original equipment fitted on their cars. Despite its commercial success and early achievements, Seiberling failed to adapt and catch up with the market changes, especially with the arrival of foreign companies who were quick to introduce the radial tire. The company was acquired in 1965 by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, ultimately belonging to Bridgestone when the latter took over Firestone. Seiberling tires are no longer sold in the US market, but the brand name is still in use in some countries. Manufactured at Firestone's plants, they are aimed to the budget-oriented consumer in selected sizes.

The episode was written by Graham Roland and directed by Paul Holahan. Plot Walter (John Noble) is recovering from the visions that the child Observer Michael gave him by touch, including that which revealed that \\"Donald,\\" the man that helped Walter in the past with the plan to defeat the Observers, is really September (Michael Cerveris). Realizing that the visions implored his sub-conscious, Walter decides to use the sensory deprivation tank to explore the visions further. With Peter's (Joshua Jackson) help, Walter is able to review the vision of September as Donald, and locates the experience as having occurred in an apartment in Brooklyn, New York. The Fringe team travels there with Michael, during which Walter reveals to Peter that he remembers things from the original time line, including the relationship he and Peter had before Peter entered the Machine. Walter helps identify the correct apartment, and they find it occupied by September, who has not seen Walter for 20-some years. September explains that after helping Fringe division in the past, the Observers had stripped him of his Observer implant and performed a \\"biological reversion\\" to make him human. He and Walter had spent time together following this, taking the name Donald from Donald O'Connor from Singin' in the Rain. September further explains that in 2167, an experiment in developing human genes and sacrificing human emotion for intelligence, would eventually give birth to the emotionless Observers. The Observers developed asexual procreation techniques; in the case of Michael, he was born from September's genes but came out as an abnormality having both emotions and great intelligence. Michael normally would have been destroyed, but September decided to hide him in the past. September now suggests that by sending Michael forward in time to 2167, September would hope they would be able to prevent the experiment from being performed, wiping out the Observers from existence. Should this happen, time would possibly be reset from the point of the Observer's first interference with the past; Olivia (Anna Torv) takes this as a chance for them to see Etta again. Walter identifies that he was given the hologram of the plans for the device from Etta (as seen in \\"Letters of Transit\\") that would be able to send Michael forward in time, which will be constructed from all of the components collected by following the tapes. The group, with September, take leave to recover an item in a nearby storage locker that is another component of the device. Elsewhere, Captain Windmark (Michael Kopsa) travels to his future of 2609 where he meets with other Observers, warning them that the child Observer has been located in their relative past. He learns of the child's relationship with September, and of September's past transactions in helping Fringe division. Windmark explains to his superior of the interference of the Fringe team and requests permission to go back to a point in time where he could prevent this, but is refused, and told that his current operations are on their planned path. On his return, he learns of September's location, and with other agents, travels there, finding the apartment empty; a bomb rigged by September goes off but Windmark and his agents escape in time. Loyalist agents help to identify the Fringe team leaving and roadblocks are put in place. At the storage facility, September finds the device and gives it to Walter. Walter confides in September that he worries Michael's visions imply Walter may die from the plan, and realizes that September's warning, \\"the boy must live\\", from 1985 (as seen in \\"Peter\\") was directed toward Michael and not Peter. September reminds Walter of the time he had received a drawn white tulip as a sign of redemption (as seen in \\"White Tulip\\"), and that he had recovered that letter for the future, as part of a notebook he had collected on the Fringe team; however, while he still has the envelope, the location of the letter itself is unknown, but September says Walter will find his redemption when he finds the letter. The team prepares to leave but Donald opts to stay behind. When they discover the roadblocks, they split up and make their way to the monorail station, which is heavily patrolled by Loyalist guards. Just as the train is about to leave, Michael steps off before Olivia can stop him, and he is taken away by guards to Windmark. Production \\"The Boy Must Live\\" was written by supervising producer Graham Roland, marking his third writing credit of the season. Roland wrote a total of thirteen episodes over the entire series run. It was directed by Paul Holahan, who previously directed season two's \\"Snakehead\\" and season four's \\"Novation\\". In the show, September shows Walter a notebook of collected information and curios that he has obtained over his time as an Observer. An encyclopedia guide, September's Notebook ‚Äî The Bishop Paradox, written by Tara Bennett and Paul Terry who had previously written the Lost Encyclopedia for Lost, has been announced - appearing similar to the prop used within the show - for sale in March 2013. Cultural references The traditional folk song \\"Greensleeves\\" is played by September using a small music box; one lyrical variation on this melody is \\"What Child Is This?\\", as noted by The A.V. Clubs Noel Murray, reflecting on the theme of the episode. Reception=Ratings= \\"The Boy Must Live\\" first aired in the United States on January 11, 2013 on Fox. An estimated 2.44 million viewers watched the episode, and earned a ratings share of 0.8 among adults aged 18 to 49. The episode dropped in viewership from the previous episode, and became the least-viewed episode of the series. =Reviews= IGN's Ramsey Isler gave the episode a good review, but called it \\"far from perfect\\". Isler very much enjoyed the full return of Michael Cerveris as September/Donald, as well as getting answers to old mysteries such as the Observer kid from \\"Inner Child\\", but felt the answer was too clich√©d.

They established their operations on Admiralty Island at Murder Cove in 1907 using the first American-built steam-powered whaler, the 97-foot \\"Tyee Junior\\", which was equipped with a harpoon gun on the bow. Consequent to a declining whale population, the company closed its operations in 1913. =Coal exploration= In 1905, the most extensive coal exploration in southeastern Alaska occurred at Murder Cove, Kootznahoo Inlet, and Hamilton Bay. The Tertiary-aged coal-bearing formations are made up of conglomerate, sandstone, and shale. The Murder Cove explorations occurred on a thick seam located from deep water. Though this deposit contains the best grade of coal in the region, further development did not proceed because of its very limited size. A lighthouse was established at Murder Cover during the fiscal year 1914. Geography Location It forms a narrow inlet in length. Just inside the entrance of the bay are several islands, beyond which the channel contracts to a width of and then opens to form a sheet of water which at high tide is wide and long. This bay forms a well-protected harbor for vessels of moderate size. At its rocky entrance is the Surprise Harbor, which provides safe anchorage and vistas of the area.

Home to the city's first settlers and changed very little since their time, it is one of Ohio's best preserved log cabins from the settlement period, and it has been named a historic site. Historic context According to local tradition, part of present-day Fairborn was occupied by an Indian village until the 1790s, when they were driven from their village by a force of soldiers from Kentucky. The land did not remain unoccupied for long; Bath Township's first settlers had become well established by the time that Greene County was organized in 1803. By the end of the 1790s, a family from Virginia named Mercer had immigrated to the Northwest Territory and purchased a large tract of land at 25¬¢ per acre (approximately $61.78 per km¬≤) that included the site of the Indian village. While the Mercers' precise date of arrival is unknown, it seems certain that crops were being raised in the township before George Washington's death in 1799. They were the first of several early families in the vicinity of modern Fairborn, which had at least five resident families by the time of the birth of the first white child in 1800.Broadstone, Michael A. History of Greene County, Ohio: Its People, Industries, and Institutions. Vol. 1. Indianapolis: Bowen, 1918. These early settlers were isolated from surrounding regions for the first twenty years after the Mercers arrived; except for the road running between the cities of Dayton and Springfield, the township's best transportation routes were paths through the dense forest, although the nearby Mad River could be used for light freight transportation during the spring floods. By the end of the 1810s, more settlers were moving into the area; Fairborn (then known as Fairfield) was platted in 1817, by which time the property was owned by Robert Mercer.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 541-542. Architecture The Mercers constructed a log cabin on their property soon after arriving; while its precise date of construction is uncertain, the Mercer Log House is believed to have been built in 1799. Set on a stone foundation,, Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2013-01-11. the house is a typical example of the region's turn-of-the-century vernacular architecture, due to features such as its square appearance (produced by the nearly one-to-one ratio between its height, length, and width), the large opening for a fireplace, and the small size of the other openings in the structure. Today, it is distinguished from most surviving log cabins in Ohio by its unusual degree of preservation; in order to expand them into larger structures, most early log cabins in the state have had additional openings cut in their walls, but the Mercer cabin's log walls are virtually unchanged from their original form. Preservation In 1981, the Mercer Log House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its historically significant architecture. It is one of three Fairborn buildings listed on the National Register, along with the Fairborn Theatre of 1948 and the former Bath Township Consolidated School of 1924. The house is owned by the city as part of the small Mercer-Smith Historical Park.City Park Guide , City of Fairborn, n.d. Accessed 2016-03-12.

As one source states (discussing the upbeat breakup song \\"Better Things\\" by The Kinks), \\"Pop music is littered with break-up masterpieces\\", but \\"[i]t's a rare break-up song that isn't bitter\\". Listening to breakup songs during a breakup can help the listener to experience a sense of catharsis. For example, songwriter Phil Collins notes that \\"People hate a break-up, but they love a break-up song. \\"Against All Odds\\" pins down how it feels to be broken-hearted, and it's one of the songs most often mentioned when people write to me, describing how it helped them through the trauma of heartbreak\\".Phil Collins, Not Dead Yet: The Memoir (2016), p. 186. Genres and styles Breakup songs can be found in every genre of music. For example, \\"You Oughta Know\\" by Alanis Morissette is categorized as alternative rock and post-grunge; \\"Tainted Love\\", originally composed by Ed Cobb and recorded as a soul music track by Gloria Jones in 1964, attained worldwide fame after being covered by Soft Cell in 1981 as a synthpop \\"the remake of Gloria Jones' \\"Tainted Love,\\" which dominated dance clubs and eventually peaked in the pop Top Ten with its synth-pop sound and Almond's plaintive vocal in 1981‚Äì1982.\\"/new wave \\"the collection has some of the biggest hits of the new wave era. Songs like \\"Cars\\" by Gary Numan, \\"Tainted Love\\" by Soft Cell (...) are the type of tunes that define the era.\\" song; \\"I Will Survive\\", popularized by Gloria Gaynor, has been described as a \\"disco anthem\\"; and \\"Achy Breaky Heart\\", popularized by Billy Ray Cyrus, is a country/rockabilly song. Some musicians are particularly well known for having written or recorded a large number of breakup songs; for example, Taylor Swift, whose penchant for the genre has been the subject of examination. The nature and style of breakup songs also changes over time. One source contends that \\"1960s charts were full of tragic break-up songs, whereas by the 1990s these were a rarity ‚Äì which may indicate that, contrary to its in-your-face aerobics'n'attitude bluster, 1990s pop is more emotionally repressed\\".Rikky Rooksby, Inside Classic Rock Tracks: Songwriting and Recording Secrets of 100 Great Songs, from 1960 to the Present Day (2001), p. 31. In many instances, breakup songs \\"spring from biographical material\\", with songwriters using the medium to record their own feelings about a breakup.Sheila Davis, The Songwriter's Idea Book (Penguin Group, 1992), \\"Strategy Twenty-Seven: Breaking Up as Plot Device\\". Breakup songs can also reflect specific phases of a breakup, including feelings of estrangement between the partners before the actual breakup, describing the breakup itself, and describing feelings in the aftermath of the breakup. Best-selling breakup songs The all-time best- selling single of a breakup song is the 1992 Whitney Houston version of \\"I Will Always Love You\\", which sold over 20 million copies. The song had originally been written and recorded in 1973 by American singer-songwriter Dolly Parton, and topped the country charts in 1974. It was written as a farewell to her one-time partner and mentor of seven years, Porter Wagoner, following Parton's decision to pursue a solo career. Other high-selling breakup songs include \\"I Will Survive\\" (14 million copies), \\"Un-Break My Heart\\" by Toni Braxton in 1996 (10 million copies), \\"Believe\\" by Cher in 1998 (10 million copies) and \\"Careless Whisper\\" by George Michael in 1984 (6 million copies).

The waters and shore of Taku Inlet The Norris Glacier as it empties into Taku Inlet, 1889. Geography A meandering, gray mud tidal stream empties into Taku Inlet Taku Inlet is suitable for use only for shallow draft river boats, as it is shallow in depth and is a ‚Äúcul-de-sac‚Äù. Taku Glacier is located at the head of this inlet. Since 1890, the glacier had moved by some into the Taku Inlet. As a result of the rapid movement of the glacier, silting has occurred at the head of the inlet. However, a clear channel exists between Taku Point and the Norris Glacier moraine, wide, with a depth of above 10 fathoms. A complete preliminary navigational chart, to a scale of 1:10,000, has been prepared by field surveys, to facilitate interested navigators to operate ships to view the glaciers. Scow Cove, Sunny Cove, Annex Peak, and Annex Lakes are some of its geographical features on its western side. On the eastern side of the inlet is Turner Lake, Bart Lake and Lake Dorothy. Norris, Taku, Hole-in‚Äìthe- Wall, Twin and Tulsequah glaciers emerge out on the southeastern side and flow into the trench of the Taku Inlet and Taku River.

He immigrated at a young age from Ireland in 1846, initially working as a storekeeper in Philadelphia and later as a clerk in New York City. At the onset of the war, in 1861, he enlisted and was commissioned as a captain with the 23rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. He assumed command of the 118th Pennsylvania Regiment in the course of the war. Gwyn led that regiment through many of its 39 recorded battles, including engagements at Seven Pines, Fredericksburg, Shepherdstown, Five Forks, Gettysburg, and Appomattox Court House. Gwyn was wounded at the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864, but returned to service after recuperating to take command of the Third, and eventually the First and Second Brigades of the First Division of the Union Army's V Corps. Gwyn was brevetted as a brigadier general by President Abraham Lincoln and then as a major general by President Andrew Johnson for his service. His men described him as \\"a handsome and accomplished officer, and a bold and aggressive leader\\".Smith (1892), p. 639 After the war, Gwyn returned to Philadelphia, although later moving to New York, and resumed his business dealings. He died on July 17, 1906, and was honored with a military funeral and buried in Woodlands Cemetery, Philadelphia. Early life Gwyn was born in Derry, Ireland on November 24, 1828.Smith (1892), pp. 638‚Äì639 He was one of ten children raised in the Protestant household of Alexander Gwyn and Catherine Garvin. His brother, Hugh Garvin Gwyn, would later serve in the Confederate States Army as a major with the 23rd Tennessee Infantry Regiment, as well as an adjutant to General John Hunt Morgan. He lived in the rural Irish city until he enrolled in Foyle College. Like many Irish in the 1840s, Gwyn left Ireland for the United States during the Great Famine. He boarded the John R. Skiddy, a packet ship from Liverpool, bound for New York City. On November 4, 1846, Gwyn arrived in America via the Port of New York, 22 days before his 18th birthday, although his immigration papers list him as 20. Imperial Hotel Belfast, 1885 Upon arriving in the United States, Gwyn and many other Derry immigrants made their way to Philadelphia as was noted by an Emigration Officer Edward Smith at Derry that, \\"Nevertheless, the money that recent arrivals in America remitted for the passage of others was central to the whole link between Derry and Philadelphia\\". On August 30, 1850, Gwyn took up residence in the North Mulberry Ward where he owned a house. He married Pennsylvania native Margaretta E. Young in February. Although he worked as a clerk throughout the 1850s, he later formed a dried goods business with George H. Stewart, called \\"Gwyn & Stewart Dry Goods\\". Gwyn purchased a plot in the Woodlands Cemetery on October 12, 1853. Records show that on April 28, 1857 'James Gwyn & Lady' from Philadelphia visited the Imperial Hotel Belfast until at least July 2. Gwyn's wife gave birth to his first child, Elizabeth Gailey Gwyn, on December 7, 1858, and their second daughter, Matilda Geddes, on January 2, 1861. Military service=Enlistment with the 23rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry= Depiction of the Battle of Seven Pines, Harper's Magazine, 16 August 1862 issue Gwyn enlisted in Company G of the 23rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry on April 21, 1861, one week after the American Civil War began. He served in that company without interruption until July 31, 1861, when he transferred to Company F. He resumed duty with the new company on August 2, 1861. Gwyn served with the 23rd Volunteers for over one year; in that time, he took part in the Battle of Seven Pines, where, on May 31, 1862, Gwyn led the 23rd in aiding other Union companies in collecting escaped fugitives. Gwyn resigned from the 23rd Volunteers on July 22, 1862 where he accepted a promotion to lieutenant colonel in a new regiment. =Lieutenant colonel, 118th Pennsylvania Infantry= Illustration of James Gwyn in the History of the Corn Exchange RegimentSmith (1892), p. 17 Gywn joined the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry, on July 25, 1862. The 118th, which was commissioned by the United States Department of War for three years of service, gathered recruits from the Philadelphia area during August 15 to 30th,1862. Gwyn was officially mustered into service on August 16, 1862. During this time, the 118th became known as the \\"Corn Regiment\\", because the funds for raising the regiment were furnished by the Corn Exchange Association of Philadelphia. Having gathered 1,296 volunteers during the two-week period, the \\"Corn Regiment\\" left for Washington, D.C., to be assigned a position in the Union Army on September 1, 1862. The regiment was embedded with the First Brigade, First Division, Fifth Army Corps under the regiment command of Colonel Charles Prevost, and brigade commander Colonel James Barnes. The 118th Regiment moved out with the rest of the Fifth Army Corps marching towards Maryland. Upon reaching Maryland, the 118th along with the rest of the Fifth Army Corps, became involved in the Battle of Antietam. While that battle would become to be known as \\"the bloodiest day in American history\\" with over 22,000 casualties, the 118th was not involved on the front lines. They instead assisted in artillery stocking. The 118th Regiment returned to battle three days afterwards, taking part in the Battle of Shepherdstown. The regiment took heavy casualties during the battle, suffering 71 deaths, 75 wounded, and 67 captured. The Confederates also suffered heavy losses with approximately 262 casualties in the battle. Among the Union wounded was Prevost, colonel of the 118th Regiment, who was shot through the shoulder on the last day of the battle. Prevost resigned from active duty, and Gwyn, as second-in-command, took over the regiment as acting commander. Gwyn's \\"courage and coolness\\" during that battle were praised by Colonel Barnes, the brigade commander, in a letter written five days after the battle ended. On September 28, 1862, Gwyn sent a letter to Colonel Barnes stating that the 118th Regiment did not provide the Philadelphia Inquirer with information that the paper used to publish a map and a report of the incident. Two days later, Gwyn issued a report on the Battle of Shepherdstown, noting the efforts he made to rally troops to fight back against the Confederate troops, though his efforts were in vain, as Colonel Barnes ordered to regiment to fall back. The 118th Regiment returned to the front lines on December 11, 1862, in the Battle of Fredericksburg.Smith (1892), pp. 112‚Äì129 Barnes formed the First Brigade, First Division from the 118th Pennsylvania (Gwyn), 22nd Massachusetts, 25th New York, 13th New York, 1st Michigan, and 2nd Maine Regiments. In a recorded incident during the battle, a house was discovered with hidden tobacco crates which the soldiers raided. Gwyn sharply criticized the men for breaking rank but \\"inwardly smiled at their enthusiasm\\". Following the unsuccessful Mud March of January 1863, the regiment went into 'winter quarters' until June. The Fifth Army Corps resumed activity on June 10, 1863, as it began to travel northward through enemy territory, with skirmishes frequently occurring. These travels ultimately led the Fifth Army Corps to Pennsylvania, where, on July 2, 1863, they arrived to aid the Union Army during the Battle of Gettysburg.Smith (1892), pp. 262‚Äì263 Gwyn, still as acting commander of the regiment, was given the orders to position the 118th Regiment on Cemetery Hill and to hold the position. In the afternoon, the regiment was ordered to assist Major General Daniel Sickles on the left flank that same day. On July 3, the second day of the battle, Gwyn led the 118th to Little Round Top where they held their position for two days until Union forces had achieved albeit a costly victory.Smith (1892), pp. 254‚Äì261 Following Gettysburg, the 118th Regiment moved around the state to various positions. On August 6, the regiment stationed at Warrenton, Virginia, received 109 new recruits, and on September 5, another 185. On September 30, 1863, Prevost officially retired, and Gwyn was promoted to colonel and the commanding officer of the 118th. During this time, Prevost had been stationed as commandant of a military prison in Elmira, New York. = Colonel, 118th Pennsylvania Regiment= Depiction of the Battle of the Wilderness by Kurz & Allison where Gwyn was seriously wounded in the thigh. During the autumn of 1863 and through the winter, the regiment engaged in \\"desultory fighting\\". Gwyn served perfunctorily while in command of the 118th Regiment for the ensuing five months with no notable confrontations until the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864. On the first day of battle, May 5, Gwyn was shot in the thigh, and put out of commission for at least one month. Gwyn would receive his promotion to colonel at Beverly Ford for his actions at Wilderness. Due to his injury, he was unable to lead the 118th Regiment into the multiple conflicts, including the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, the Battle of North Anna, the Battle of Totopotomoy Creek, the Battle of Bethesda Church, and the Battle of Cold Harbor. Gwyn, having returned to active duty by this time, led the 118th in the Siege of Petersburg and Richmond campaign that lasted from June 9, 1864, to March 25, 1865. The exact date and orders where Gwyn received his commission as commander of the Third Brigade is unknown, although subsequent documents show Gwyn reporting to headquarters as the brigade commander. Illustration of the 118th Regiment in the charge for Fort McRae and capture of Pegram's Farm.Smith (1892), p. 514. On August 18, 1864, Gwyn led the Third Brigade to the Weldon Railroad, where he met with the First and Second Brigade. The First Brigade was ordered to New York City, and by Special Order No. 32, he was ordered to also take command of Second Brigade and in the absence of Col. A. H. Grimshaw. The next day, the combined Union troops moved forward along the railroad until they joined the Second Division, led by General Romeyn Ayres. The Third Brigade remained at that station for the next eight days without incidence, with Gwyn submitting a report to the Headquarters of First Division concerning what transpired during those three days.Books: Civil War Official Histories (1893), p. 467. It was recorded in this time the regiment suffered heavy losses and according to Frank H. Taylor, \\"Grant was remoselessly wearing out the besieged enemy. Regiments were used unsparingly, and the \\"118th\\" was accorded its full share of the work.\\" In particular, on the morning September 30, 1864 in the Battle of Pegram's Farm, and later the Battle of Peebles's Farm, to capture Fort McRae, 118th along with 16th Michigan were in direct line of four artillery guns from a church and fired upon with \\"special severity\\".Smith (1892), p. 525. At a two road junction in the afternoon, near Fort McRae, Gwyn's leg was severely wounded when his horse fell upon him, though, did not permanently cripple him or lead to amputation.Smith (1892), p. 516. Captain Wilson, the 118th second-in-command assumed command and pressed on with Ayres offensive that eventually led to a Union victory late in that evening.Smith (1892), pp. 518 - 520. = Brevet Brigadier general, Third Brigade and 118th Pennsylvania Regiment = Charles Griffin who recommended Gwyn for promotion to brevet brigadier general Gwyn's service during the Siege of Petersburg was noted by the commanding officer of the First Division, V Corps, General Charles Griffin as examples of Gwyn's \\"gallantry\\", \\"bravery\\" and \\"valor\\". Charles Griffin informed the Department of War that Gwyn should receive the rank of brigadier general, and if that was not possible then he should be brevetted the rank. The Federal Government approved of the idea and issued Special Order 347 on October 14, 1864 in which James Gwyn was awarded the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from September 30, 1864, by President Abraham Lincoln. Gwyn was formally nominated by President Lincoln on December 12, 1864 and his appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 14, 1865.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 747. The First Division received word of Gwyn's promotion on October 14, and passed down to Gywn on the 17th. In a letter, Griffin wrote that Gwyn's promotion was \\"evidence that the gallantry of our little command has been appreciated\\". Gwyn continued his military duties with service around the James River near City Point, Virginia. Feeling ill, he returned to Philadelphia on October 31, 1864. He was diagnosed with malaria fever and prescribed a seven-day break to rest and recover. His leave was approved on November 4, and he was permitted to recover for a week, resuming duty of November 7, 1864. At his return, Gwyn, by Special Orders No. 301 was assigned to the First Division, First Brigade under Brigadier General Griffin by Major General Fred T. Locke. On November 19, 1864, he was transferred from the First Division to the Second Division, which was under the command of General Romeyn Ayres. Ayres ordered Gwyn to take command of the Third Brigade on November 21. Two days later, Gwyn was notified that General Ayres would be absent for three days and would be fulfilling his role as acting commander of the Second Division. On December 14, General Ayres sent a report praising Gwyn's 'prompt' and 'efficient' service during the Battle of Globe Tavern, August 18‚Äì21, 1864, to the Fifth Army Corps. Gwyn led the Third Brigade without problems until December 21, when he was informed that General Ayres would be on a leave of absence for the twenty days, and that he would lead the Second Division until Ayres' return. Gwyn took control of the Second Division, but soon went on a leave of absence from January 8, 18 days into his 20-day service assignment, to January 21, 1865. On February 5, he led the Third Brigade into the Battle of Hatcher's Run. On February 6, the Confederates engaged the Union army at 1:30PM. The Third Brigade engaged the Rebels and were eventually overwhelmed and were forced to retreat. The Assistant Adjutant, Major General Locke, ordered Gwyn to reform the Third Brigade and to take on stragglers from assorted Maryland regiments. The fighting continued into the next day; by February 8, the Union forces near Hatcher's Run had retreated. On February 14, Major General Ayres highlighted Gwyn's leadership during the Battle of Hatcher's Run by stating that Gwyn had \\"seconded me with zeal and energy\\". Three days later, Gwyn wrote his own letter with names of soldiers who he thought were deserving of merit for their exceptional service during the Battle of Hatcher's Run. = End of the Civil War = 118th Regiment at Camp Union, August 1862 The Third Brigade fell back for over a month engaging in skirmishes around Hatcher's Run, Halifax road, and Rowanty Creek as part of the Richmond Campaign.Smith (1892), pp. 561‚Äì580. Major operations resumed on March 31, 1865, when Gwyn led the Third Brigade in the Battle of White Oak Road, and eventually on to Five Forks, Dinwiddie County, Virginia.Smith (1892), pp. 580‚Äì589. The Third Brigade took part in the Battle of Five Forks on April 1, 1865. A charge led by Gwyn resulted in the capture of two strategic positions and a large number prisoners. Gwyn was later appointed brevet major general for his efforts during the battle. On January 13, 1869, President Andrew Johnson nominated Gwyn for appointment to the grade of brevet major general of volunteers, to rank from April 1, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 16, 1869. Gwyn and the 118th pushed onwards, pressing the retreating Confederate troops during the Battle of Appomattox Court House, one of the last major battles of the Civil War. At the Appomattox Court House, on April 9, 1865, Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant, thus ending the Civil War. The 118th was present to witness the surrender and escorted the Confederate soldier that carried the truce flag.Smith (1892), p. 590 With the hostilities subsided, Gwyn filed a report concerning the skirmish at White Oak Road on April 14, 1865. A few weeks later on April 27, 1865, Brevet Major General Ayres advocated that Gwyn receive a promotion on account of his \\"zeal and good conduct\\" from March 29 to April 9 of that year. Gwyn led the Third Brigade to Washington, D.C. for the Grand Review of the Armies, which took place on May 23 and 24, 1865. They arrived in Washington early by May 21 to attend roll- call with the rest of the Fifth Army Corps. According to the New York Times, Gwyn was listed at the Headquarters Army of the Potomac as \\"Third Brigade, Brevet Brig.-Gen. James Gwyn, commanding‚Äî190th Pennsylvania, Col. W.R. Hartshorne; 210th Pennsylvania, Major J.H. Graves; 4th Delaware, Brevet Lieut- Col. M.B. Gist; 3d Delaware, Capt. D.D. Joseph; 8th Delaware, Capt. John Richards; 191st Pennsylvania, Col. James Carle.\\" On June 5, 1865, the 118th Regiment was officially mustered out of service by the United States Department of War.Smith (1892), p. 607 On June 9, a large banquet was prepared in their honor by the Corn Exchange, the same bank that offered the initial payments for recruits to join years before, at Sansom Street Hall for the members of the former 118th Regiment, who had returned to Philadelphia. According to his obituary, Gwyn was offered a position as a lieutenant in the regular army by President Andrew Johnson, but instead chose to return to civilian life. Post Civil War Following the conclusion of the Civil War, Gwyn resumed the life he had left behind in 1861. He returned home to his wife Margaret and daughters Elizabeth and Matilda, now five years older than the last time he saw them. He applied for his military pension on October 6, 1866. Though Gwyn served in positions with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received would be reduced to the level of his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864. His wife gave birth to a third daughter, Margaret, on December 7, 1869. Gwyn and his family later moved from Philadelphia to a home in New York City. Gwyn had become connected with the mercantile house, Stuart Bros and returned to that business. Later on he would take a new job as a clerk in New York. His daughter Margaret married Frank L. Rehn where they moved out of the Brooklyn area to No. 9 Grove Street Yonkers, New York. Gwyn's middle daughter Matilda married in 1891 to a stockbroker, Andrew S. Brownell. They also moved away from the Brooklyn area to Matilda's house in Yonkers.  Death  Gwyn family Woodlands Cemetery record for Section E. Gwyn died in the late evening of July 17, 1906 while visited his daughter, Mrs. Frank L. Rehn (Margaret), at her home in Yonkers, New York. News of his death was reported in The New York Times and The Washington Post as far away as Salt Lake City in the Deseret News. His body was taken back to Philadelphia, where he was interred in the Woodlands Cemetery following a military funeral on July 19, 1906. He was buried in the cemetery plot section E, Lot 33 that he bought over fifty years earlier.

The quartz ledge at the Crystal Mine was first discovered in 1895 by B. Heins. It was so named because of the large pyrite cubes which were found occurring in the surface outcrops of the ledge. Gold was extracted till 1905 from quartz using ten-stamp mill and from about 1,000 feet of underground workings yielded 1,210 ounces of gold. Intermittent production of gold is reported till 1925 but there are no records of the yield. The formation was determined as of 54 to 56 Ma age. The gold yielding resources available from the mine were assessed as 9,000 tons of material with yield of 0.21 ounce of gold per ton. Geography On the sides of many of the pyrite cubes, small particles and crystals of gold may be observed, and this somewhat novel occurrence makes the ore of special mineralogic interest. The mine workings were situated from the wharf at Snettisham and above high tide water. The ledge has a width of from , averaging about , and is exposed for over in length. Fragments of the enclosing andesite are often included in the vein, and these as well as the quartz carry the gold values. Geology The gold deposits were discovered in quartz veins (in undulating form) in a low-angle fault with a strike of S30-50E and dipping 8-35E; the fault itself was identified as in thickness in rock formations of amphibolite as part of the Snettisham ultramafic complex. Sheared and altered amphibolite were the dominant formations in the fault where quartz were not found; the fault zone also had large fillings of weathered calcite orange in colour, with quartz formation located in a limited thickness of few inches to . The composition of quarts varied with 60 percent silicified amphibolite to 100 % of quartzite. The veins were also filled with gauges. Quartz and calcite crystals up to long were common and pyrites covered with euhedral gold crystals were found in 60% of the veins. A remarkable sample of a cubic pyrite crystal from the Crystal Mine, which measures about on a side with large amount of terminated crystals of gold on its surface, is on display in the Smithsonian Institution. Based on detailed geological investigations of the mine, the age of the formation has been determined as 54 to 56 Ma. The gold resources available from the mine was assessed as 9,000 tons of material with yield potential of 0.21 ounce of gold per ton. History Crystal Mine was discovered in 1895 and the ten-stamp mill was installed in 1901. Operations were first undertaken in 1901-2, aided by a 20-stamp mill close to the shore at Snettisham, said to have produced approximately $25,000 work of gold. In 1903, the mine was purchased by the Alaska Snettisham Gold Mining Company and rapid development immediately began. At the close of the year 1903, the work done aggregated of tunneling and drifting along the ledge at different levels. These levels were connected by winzes and much of the intermediate ore was mined. Power was acquired by a flume over a in length, which follows the mountain slope at an elevation of , collecting water from the many small creeks. This was connected with a pipe line, which supplied Pelton wheels at the mill, and a total of 300 horsepower was obtained. In 1904, mining continued, and most of the developed ore is said to have been stamped out and milled. Early in 1905, this company discontinued operations at Snettisham and plans were being made to remove both mill and mine equipment. During this time the ore mined up to 1905 in about 1,000 feet of underground workings yielded about 1,210 ounces of gold. By 1909, 750 tons of ore had been processed. Work continued intermittently and had finally stopped in 1925. At that time the mine consisted of 2,350 feet of tunnels, 5 stages, a 175 ft upper adit with a stet. Gold produced after 1905 was not recorded.

At the outbreak of war the Army comprised a small regular component and a large, but ill-trained and equipped, militia force. In September 1939 the government authorised the establishment of the Second Australian Imperial Force for overseas service; this force eventually reached a strength of four infantry divisions, an armoured division and various headquarters and support units. The militia force, which remained in Australia, was neglected until the outbreak of the Pacific War. The militia units were fully activated in late 1941, and additional such formations were established in 1942. Despite the loss of the 8th Division in February 1942, the Army reached its peak strength of eleven infantry divisions and three armoured divisions later that year. This force was larger than what the Australian economy could support, however, and was gradually reduced in size. At the end of 1943 the Government determined that the Army's strength was to be six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades, though further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945. If the conflict had continued past August 1945, the size of the Army would have been further reduced to three divisions. Following the end of the war the Australian Army was rapidly demobilized. However, the force formed for occupation duties in Australia became the nucleus of the permanent Australian Regular Army, and a large number of militia units continued to be maintained.

Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the same abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications. Elixir also provides productive tooling and an extensible design. The latter is supported by compile-time metaprogramming with macros and polymorphism via protocols. Elixir is used by companies such as PagerDuty, Discord, E-MetroTel, Pinterest, Moz, Bleacher Report, The Outline, Inverse, Divvy, FarmBot and for building embedded systems. The community organizes yearly events in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as minor local events and conferences. History Jos√© Valim is the creator of the Elixir programming language, a research and development project of Plataformatec. His goals were to enable higher extensibility and productivity in the Erlang VM while keeping compatibility with Erlang's ecosystem. Jos√© Valim aimed to create a programming language for large-scale sites and apps. Being a Ruby developer, he used features of Ruby, Erlang, and Clojure to develop a high-concurrency and low-latency language. Elixir was designed to handle large data volumes. Its speed and capabilities spread Elixir in telecommunication, eCommerce, and finance industries. On July 12, 2018, Honeypot released a mini-documentary on Elixir.  Versioning  Elixir mostly follows semantic versioning and has only 1 major version with no plans for a second. Each of the minor versions supports a specific range of Erlang/OTP versions. Features * compiles to bytecode for the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM) * Everything is an expression * Erlang functions can be called from Elixir without run time impact, due to compilation to Erlang bytecode, and vice versa * Meta programming allowing direct manipulation of abstract syntax tree (AST) * Polymorphism via a mechanism called protocols. Like in Clojure, protocols provide a dynamic dispatch mechanism. However, this is not to be confused with multiple dispatch as Elixir protocols dispatch on a single type. * Support for documentation via Python-like docstrings in the Markdown formatting language * Shared nothing concurrent programming via message passing (Actor model) * Emphasis on recursion and higher-order functions instead of side-effect-based looping * Lightweight concurrency utilizing Erlang's mechanisms * Railway oriented programming via the \`with\` construct * Built-in tooling for managing dependencies, code compilation, running tests, formatting code, remote debugging and more * Lazy and async collections with streams * Pattern matching to promote assertive code * Unicode support and UTF-8 strings Examples The following examples can be run in an \`iex\` shell or saved in a file and run from the command line by typing \`elixir \`.

He eventually settled in Athens, Greece via Chios and then Peiraias. At the time, Miran Kourounlian was already experienced in making pastirma and sujuk and decided to establish a self-named charcuterie business on 45 Evripidou Street near the Omonoia Square of Athens. The market soon became popular throughout Athens, as it was one of the few pastourma and soutzouki sellers in the city. The company became even more popular when Miran Kourounlian's son Bedros took over management in 1960 and began distributing the products throughout Greece. The store originally occupied an area of 3 m2. In 1983 Bedros expanded the Miran product factory to 1300 m2. After the death of Bedros in the 1990s, the family business was passed to his heirs, brothers Miran and Krikor Kourounlian, who manage the business today. Today Miran pastourmas exterior detail Miran Pastourma serves pastourma and soutzouki in its original location on 45 Evripidou Street. In 1994, the third generation of the Kourounlian pastourma makers has started a further expansion of the business both inside Greece and to the European Union. Under the management of Miran and Krikor Kourounlian, the company obtained a European Union export code in 1994. It is now distributing products throughout the European Union and other countries. Miran has taken control of the Athens store while his brother Krikor oversees the factory, which produces between seven and ten tons of processed meat products yearly. According to current manager Miran Kourounlian, the company's success is due to its traditional preparation methods and the quality of the beef, which is superior overall to that found in Greece, since it is imported from Argentina.

To celebrate the occasion, the grandson of Miran along with his brother Krikor and their father Bedros organised a party where they introduced their new product, pastourma made of camel meat. Milan's products include imported and Greek processed meats, cheese and spices. The Kourounlians have also signed agreements with similar enterprises in Europe under which the foreign enterprises will tailor their recipes according to the Miran product specifications so that their products will appeal to Greek consumers. The company's products can now be found in major Greek supermarket chains. A postal-delivery system for their products has been established to reach the internal Greek market. The delivery is free inside Greece and the meat is packed in special polystyrene packaging with dry ice to preserve freshness. Reception Miran Pastourma is also known for hanging pastourma and soutzouki from the ceiling The Greek edition of Elle magazine includes Miran's charcuterie in its list of the best of its kind. elle.gr Œ†Œøœç Œ∏Œ± Œ≤œÅŒµŒØœÑŒµ œÑŒ± Œ∫Œ±ŒªœçœÑŒµœÅŒ± Œ±ŒªŒªŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑœÖœÅŒπŒ¨ Quote: \\" ŒúŒπœÅŒ¨ŒΩ ŒöŒ±œÑŒµœàœÖŒ≥ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ œÄŒ±œÉœÑŒøœÖœÅŒºŒ±Œ¥œåœÄŒπœÑŒ±, œÄŒ±œÉœÑŒøœÖœÅŒºŒ¨œÇ œáœâœÅŒØœÇ œÑœÉŒπŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒπ, œÄŒøœÖ Œ¥ŒµŒΩ ŒºœÖœÅŒØŒ∂ŒµŒπ, œÄŒ±œÉœÑŒøœÖœÅŒºŒ¨œÇ Œ±œÄœå Œ≥Œ±ŒªŒøœÄŒøœçŒªŒ±, Œ∫Œ±Œ≤ŒøœÖœÅŒºŒ¨œÇ, Œ≤ŒøŒ¥ŒπŒΩŒÆ Œ≥ŒªœéœÉœÉŒ± Œ∫Œ±œÄŒΩŒπœÉœÑŒÆ, œÉŒøœÖœÑŒ∂ŒøœçŒ∫Œπ, Œ∫Œ±œÄŒΩŒπœÉœÑœå œÜŒπŒªŒ≠œÑŒø Œ∫ŒøœÑœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒø, Œ≤ŒøŒ¥ŒπŒΩœå œÄŒ±œÉœÑœÅŒ¨ŒºŒπ ŒºŒµ œÄŒπœÄŒ≠œÅŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∫œåŒªŒπŒ±ŒΩœÑœÅŒø.

One day a painter visits the house to paint a wall which leaves Charu miffed because she wasn't informed about it by anyone. Charu asks the painter to quickly finish his job and gets busy. A few minutes later she discovers that the painter is lying unconscious on the floor. Charu looks for some kind of identification on the man but doesn't find one. Not knowing who to inform or call, Charu takes the painter to a hospital and decides to find out the identity of the stranger.

Latting was the first female Mayor of Oklahoma City. Early life Latting was born in Texhoma, Oklahoma, on August 27, 1918. She graduated from Classen High School in Oklahoma City. She received a bachelor's degree with honors in mathematics from the University of Oklahoma in 1938. In 1939, Latting obtained a master's degree in economics and statistics from Columbia University in New York City. Political career Latting became a member of both the Parent Teacher Association and the League of Women Voters. It was her membership in the League of Women Voters that led to her entry into the political realm in the early 1960s. Latting realized that the way state legislative district borders were drawn in Oklahoma was antiquated. Rural areas of the state still enjoyed more representation in the Oklahoma Legislature while more populated, urban areas were under-represented. The districts had not been reformed since Oklahoma achieved statehood in 1907. In 1964, Latting testified before a United States federal court which was investigating the legality of the state elections held that same year. Latting, who had a background in statistics, became involved in the reapportionment and redistricting of the new state House and Senate districts, which were more proportionally distributed between urban and rural areas. In 1967, Latting was elected to the Oklahoma City Council representing Ward 2, becoming the first woman to serve on the council. =Mayor of Oklahoma City (1971‚Äì1983)= In 1971, Latting announced her candidacy for Mayor of Oklahoma City. She felt at the time that incumbent city officials were mismanaging city funds. Latting defeated fellow councilman Bill Bishop with 32,271 to 22,132 in a mayoral runoff election held on April 6, 1971. Bishop, her opponent, had been endorsed by outgoing Oklahoma City Mayor James Norick. Latting was sworn into office on April 13, 1971, becoming the city's first female mayor. Oklahoma City became the largest city in U.S. history to be headed by a woman at the time. Latting's efforts to reform city government were opposed during her first year by city council, which had an \\"anti-reform council majority.\\" In one instance, the council nullified all of Latting's appointments and nominations to various city boards and commissions while she was out of town. That overreach by her opponents on the council proved to be unpopular with Oklahoma City residents. Latting's allies won a majority of the seats on the council in the next municipal election as a result. Latting held office as Mayor from 1971 to 1983. The city and her administration adopted a new master development plan during her tenure. Latting supported an urban renewal process, known as the Pei Plan, which saw hundreds of older, low-rise downtown buildings demolished in favor of skyscrapers and other modern structures. New businesses and manufacturers also moved to Oklahoma City during Latting's tenure, including General Motors and Xerox. Latting served three, four-year terms as Mayor. She declined to run for re-election to a fourth term and retired from office in 1983. She was succeeded by Mayor Andy Coats. Recognitions and later life In 1980, Mayor Latting was named to the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. She was also the 1995 recipient of the Constitution Award from Rogers State College for her career in public service. In 2005, a bust of Latting was dedicated in Oklahoma City Hall outside the mayor's office. She remained actively involved with state charitable, cultural and civic groups after leaving office, including the Oklahoma Heritage Association, the Support Center of Oklahoma, and Oklahoma City Beautiful. Most recently, the Patience Latting Library, the newest branch of the city's public library system, was opened to the public in 2011. Patience Latting died on December 29, 2012, at the age of 94. The late mayor was laid in state at Oklahoma City Hall beginning on January 3, 2013, becoming the first former mayor to receive this honor. Her coffin was placed in the city hall's main foyer surrounded by an honor guard of city police officers and firefighters. A funeral was held at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Oklahoma City on January 5, 2013. Her husband, oil businessman Trimble Latting, had died in 1996.

It is located at 105 Vivekananda Road, Kolkata, India. In this house, Swami Vivekananda (then called Narendranath Datta) was born on 12 January 1863. The house remained Vivekananda's home throughout his childhood and early youth. The cultural centre was inaugurated by the President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.  History  After the death of his father (Vishwanath Datta) in 1884, Narendranath's aunt, who was living with them in that house, claimed full possession of the property. She filed a lawsuit against Narendranath's mother (Bhuvaneswari Devi) and her family. Vivekananda won the case in the lower court, but the case was appealed to a higher court. The case continued for many years in higher courts. It concluded only a few days before Vivekananda's death in 1902. According to the final ruling in the case, Vivekananda was awarded full legal possession of his ancestral house.  Renovation  Over time, the ancestral house of Vivekananda became dilapidated. In 1962, Ramakrishna Mission authorities decided to acquire the property and turn it into a museum. In May 1999, the Ramakrishna Mission acquired the land and the adjacent plot through the Government of West Bengal. A committee was set up for this project. The committee managed to amass a fund of from Central Government, State Government, and public donations of which were granted by the Central Government. In 2004, after renovation, the house was turned into a museum and cultural centre.

Biography Oda was a native of Fukuoka Prefecture. From 1938, he was the commanding officer of the IJA 50th Infantry Regiment, which was in combat during the Battle of Xuzhou in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The regiment was withdrawn back to Japan in December 1939. In August 1940, he was promoted major general and became the commanding officer of the infantry group of the IJA 26th Division, which at the time was under the command of the Mongolia Garrison Army. In September 1941, he became the Commandant of Toyohashi Reserve Officers' Cadet School. However, due to the death of Major General Tomitar≈ç Horii the Kokoda Track campaign in New Guinea, Oda was assigned as his replacement as Commander of the South Seas Detachment. However, the South Seas Detachment found itself flanked by Allied forces and in a location where neither reinforcements or supplies could reach. When ordered to withdraw by IJA 18th Army headquarters, Oda left behind the sick and wounded and led his men to the banks of the Kumusi River, only to find out that all of the remaining boats when he had planned on for his retreat had been taken by troops which had preceded him. He committed suicide on the river bank by shooting himself with his pistol. He was posthumously promoted to lieutenant general.http://www.generals.dk/general/Oda/Kensaku/Japan.html Kensaku Oda (1888 ‚Äì 1943) References Category:1888 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Japanese generals Category:Japanese military personnel of World War II Category:Japanese military personnel who committed suicide Category:Military personnel from Fukuoka Prefecture ","title":"Kensaku Oda"},{"id":"38202912","text":"School building Rivercrest High School is a comprehensive public high school located in unincorporated Mississippi County, Arkansas, United States, in proximity to Marie and with a Wilson postal address.

It is a semi protected deep water port that was developed to transport many mineral deposits found in the Snettisham Peninsula. Lieutenant Joseph Whidbey of the Royal Navy discovered the fjord on August 12, 1794; George Vancouver named it after the town of Snettisham in England.USGS GNIS Feature Detail Report: Port Snettisham Geography The entrance to Port Snettisham is on the northeast side of Stephens Passage, to the east of Admiralty Island, about southeast of Juneau and from the Canada‚ÄìUS border to the east. The eastern shore to the north of Point Windham is a very large bay which is divided into two bays. The first bay is called the Holkham Bay and the other bay is named as Port Snettisham. Snettisham is an inland water way in the system of waterways in the partially protected system along the coasts of southeastern Alaska and Canada. It is a deep water bay which was proposed to be developed to facilitate transportation of magnetite. The fiord has three branches. At the head of North Arm is Speel River, a swift-flowing stream which enters the Coast Range for a distance of . The tributary to East Arm, a much shorter inlet, is Whiting River, traversing the mountain system for , though not crosscutting it. This river is navigable in small boats for about from the mud flats at its mouth. At the head of South Arm are extensive flats which are bare at low water for a distance of , and back of these is a low valley in length connecting with Holkham Bay. From the shore line, the land rises abruptly to peaks reaching heights of . The Snettisham Peninsula, a promontory with peaks averaging in elevation, is connected with the mainland by a low pass less than above tide level. Snettisham post office is situated on the north end of this peninsula and inside the entrance to Port Snettisham. People Historically, the Taku people have had several settlements at Port Snettisham, and still visit the area to fish, particularly for sockeye salmon. Economy Map of Port Snettisham and principal mines Several mineral deposits were discovered in the drainage basin of the port. The iron ore deposits identified in 1954 were located in a stretch of about to southwest of the Sentinel Point extending into the southeastern shore line of the port. It was suggested in 1954 to establish a small dock, deep enough for large ocean- going vessels. Of all the deposits developed, gold was the chief mineral output, mined by the Alaska Snettisham Gold Mining Company which was established on the south shore of the Port Snettisham, from the entrance. The quartz ledge which constitutes the Crystal Mine was discovered by B. Heins in 1895. A 20-stamp mill was in operation by 1901. This mine was purchased in 1903 by the Alaska Snettisham Gold Mining Company, but operations were discontinued by 1905. The Port Snettisham Iron Ore Property is located in Port Snettisham, and includes 49 contiguous properties, encompassing an area of , under an agreement between Arrowstar Resources Ltd. (formerly Gulfside Minerals) and Pacific Rim Mineral. See also *Juneau gold belt References * This article contains public domain text from A.C.

He was involved in a very wide range of projects and his output was prodigious. He came to be regarded as one of the finest symphonic orchestrators of his generation. He was dedicated to the conservation, recording and promotion of classic film scores by composers such as Bernard Herrmann, Dimitri Tiomkin, Franz Waxman, Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, Elmer Bernstein and others. He wrote full biographies as well as sleeve notes, radio scripts, reviews and articles, on composers such as Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, Karol Szymanowski, Arthur Bliss, George Dyson, Herbert Howells, Maurice Ravel, Nikolai Tcherepnin and others. He arranged music from the film scores and other music of William Walton, Malcolm Arnold, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Ernest Bloch. Artists who have performed his work include Jos√© Carreras, James Galway, Julian Lloyd Webber, and Jill Gomez. Outside the area of music, he put together anthologies of the prose of Arthur Machen and James Farrar. He died of an AIDS-related disease at the age of 48. Biography Palmer was born in Norfolk in 1946. He early showed interest in music, encouraged by his father, a RAF pilot, who had trained as a church organist. He was educated at Norwich School and studied the organ at Saxlingham, then went on to the University of Cambridge, where he qualified in modern languages and music. His teachers at Cambridge included Peter le Huray and Sir David Willcocks. His first involvement in film music was as a writer, and through this he met many film composers in the United Kingdom and the United States. He struck up a friendship with Bernard Herrmann, who was living in London at the time. He assisted Herrmann with his scoring for Taxi Driver and Obsession (both released in 1976; Herrmann died in December 1975, just after completing the score to Taxi Driver). Through Herrmann, Palmer had met Charles Gerhardt, with whom he collaborated on at least 15 albums. Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa was impressed by Palmer's critiques of his work and invited him to assist with the orchestration of his score for Providence (1977) and all his subsequent films. He then met Elmer Bernstein, who used Palmer's assistance in scoring Heavy Metal (1981). This led to further orchestration work with film composers such as Maurice Jarre (A Passage to India (1984), Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)), Stanley Myers (The Witches (1990)), and many others. Not content to work only on new film projects, Christopher Palmer also sought to preserve the legacy of the past, by arranging symphonic suites from the scores of composers such as Sir Malcolm Arnold, William Alwyn, Sir Arthur Bliss, George Gershwin, Bronis≈Çaw Kaper, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Jerome Moross, Alfred Newman, Alex North, Conrad Salinger, Max Steiner, Dimitri Tiomkin, Sir William Walton, Franz Waxman, and Roy Webb. He appeared as himself in the 1992 documentary film Music for the Movies: Bernard Herrmann. He collaborated with Sergei Prokofiev's son Oleg Prokofiev on the publication of Serge Prokofiev, Soviet Diary, 1927 and other writings (Faber and Faber, 1991). His planned biography of Prokofiev was left unfinished at his death, which was due to an HIV/AIDS-related illness in 1995, when he was aged only 48. One of the last things he said to Ray Sumby, his literary editor, was \\"Ray, don't take on too much.\\" Arrangements and orchestrations Christopher Palmer's arrangements and orchestrations included: * For the memorial service for Lord Laurence Olivier in October 1989, Palmer created a version of Sir William Walton's march Crown Imperial for solo organ, brass, timpani and percussion (with harp ad lib). He arranged Walton's score for Henry V (1944), under the title Henry V: A Shakespeare Scenario; a recording was released in 1990, with Christopher Plummer reading the speeches. * He arranged Sergei Prokofiev's music to the film Ivan the Terrible into a concert scenario (1990). * He made a concert suite from the music to The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) by Malcolm Arnold, including \\"The River Kwai March\\". He arranged an item from Arnold's score for the film You Know What Sailors Are (1954) as \\"Scherzetto for clarinet and orchestra\\". * He arranged music from Ralph Vaughan Williams' The Pilgrim's Progress as A Bunyan Sequence. A recording featured Sir John Gielgud as narrator. * He arranged Ernest Bloch's From Jewish Life for cello, strings and harp (it was originally set for cello and piano). * The Holy Boy by John Ireland (originally for piano, 1913), for solo cello and strings (1993) and for solo voice, choir and string orchestra (1993). Record producer His activities as a record producer included: * the world premiere commercial recording in 1992 of Constant Lambert's choral masque Summer's Last Will and Testament * a complete recording of Benjamin Britten's last opera, Death in Venice, made for a television film directed by Tony Palmer. Writings Christopher Palmer's writings included: * Impressionism in Music (1973) * Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa. A Sketch of His Life And Work. With a foreword by Eugene Ormandy (1975) * Delius: Portrait of a Cosmopolitan. London: Duckworth (1976) * Szymanowski (1983) * The Britten Companion, ed. Palmer (1984) * Tcherepnin, Nikolay, in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, ed. Stanley Sadie (1992) * writings on Arthur Bliss, George Dyson, Herbert Howells, Maurice Ravel, Dimitri Tiomkin * he made an English translation of Darius Milhaud's autobiography Notes Without Music, with an additional chapter by himself * The Composer in Hollywood (1993) * his work on a new biography of Sergei Prokofiev was cut short by his death in 1995. His papers on this project are stored at the Serge Prokofiev Archive He was effectively the editor of Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa's memoir, Double Life (1982), which he organized from the composer's dictated recollections. In addition there were record reviews, program notes, radio scripts, lecture scripts, and record sleeve notes. Christopher Palmer was twice nominated, both times unsuccessfully, for the Grammy Award for Best Album Notes: * in 1975 for Herrmann: Citizen Kane performed by Charles Gerhardt conducting the National Philharmonic Orchestra * in 1976 for Korngold: Die tote Stadt performed by Erich Leinsdorf conducting the Munich Radio Orchestra with solos by Ren√© Kollo, Carol Neblett, Hermann Prey and Benjamin Luxon. Film music Christopher Palmer composed the original music for Milo≈° Forman's film Valmont (1989). He worked as an orchestrator or arranger on such films as Obsession (1976), Zulu Dawn (1979), A Passage to India (1984), Spies Like Us (1985), Legal Eagles (1986), Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989), Shirley Valentine (1989) and The Witches (1990). He was the Musical Assistant/Associate on films such as The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985), Music Co- Producer on Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984), and Music Consultant on Cape Fear (1991).

Early Life  The better part of Magn√≥n's life was dedicated to the Mexican revolution; she even began her life as a refugee‚Äîher father, Joaquin Villegas, brought her family to the United States to escape the fighting in Mexico. By 1895, Magn√≥n had received her bachelor's and teaching certificate at New York's Academy of Mount St. Ursula. She married Aldopho Magn√≥n, an American Citizen in 1901. They settled in Mexico City to teach kindergarten out of their home. The couple had three children. Magn√≥n also began to write articles criticizing then Mexican dictator Porfirio D√≠az in La Cr√≥nica, a Spanish-language newspaper founded by the Idar family (of Jovita Idar) that exposed injustices against the community.  Career  Because of Magn√≥n's political affiliation her father's businesses in Mexico began to be shut down, and Magn√≥n fled to Laredo, Texas, while her husband stayed in Mexico. There in Laredo she continued to teach kindergarten. When Nuevo Laredo was attacked in March 1913, Magnon, alongside other Laredo women marched across the Rio Grande to aid the wounded. To assure a more organized assistance, Leonor formed and financed La Cruz Blanca, The White Cross. When Nuevo Laredo was attacked again on January 1, 1914, Magnon eventually transformed her home, garage, and school into a makeshift hospital for her all-volunteer medical team, La Cruz Blanca. More than 100 of Venustiano Carranza soldiers were treated in her home that month. American army officials often tried to arrest the Mexican Soldier-patients, but Magnon refused to release them and organized an escape for most soldiers by having visitors bring them clean street clothes. When nearly forty men were detained at Fort McIntosh, Texas, Magnon hired an attorney to free the men. She was unsuccessful but eventually the Secretary of State would release the soldiers. After the war, the Mexican government awarded her with five different medals for her efforts in the Revolution. Magn√≥n detailed her experiences as a volunteer in La Cruz Blanca in her autobiography, La Rebelde (The Rebel), and this is where we get much of the information about Cruz Blanca's operation. Magn√≥n was careful to leave two versions of her memoirs‚Äîone written in Spanish, and one translated into English, entitled The Rebel. Magn√≥n wrote these manuscripts (called \\"novelized memoirs\\") in the third person, and wrote about important figures in the revolution, including women who helped carry out Cruz Blanca's operations. Unfortunately, her memoirs would not be seen by the public until 1994, when her granddaughter was able to publish it through Arte Publico Press. After her father's death in 1910, Magn√≥n was not allowed to visit her father in Mexico for a proper burial due to the war. But four years later the Mexican government would award her five medals for her work at La Cruz Blanca.  Death  She died in Mexico City on April 17, 1955 at the age of 78.

Its autocephaly was recognised by Shenouda III, Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria after Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopia in 1993. History= Origins = Tewa·∏•ido (Ge'ez ·â∞·ãã·àï·ã∂ tewa·∏•ido) is a Ge'ez word meaning \\"being made one\\", cognate to Arabic tawhid. According to the Orthodox Encyclopedia (1917 edition) article on the Henoticon:Henoticon around 500 bishops within the Patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem refused to accept the \\"two natures\\" doctrine decreed by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, thus separating themselves from the future Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. This separate Christian communion came to be known as Oriental Orthodoxy. The Oriental Orthodox Churches, which today include the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church of India, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, are referred to as \\"Non-Chalcedonian\\". These churches themselves describe their Christology as miaphysite, but outsiders often incorrectly describe them as \\"monophysite\\". Tewahedo Orthodoxy is a major ethnoreligious group in Eritrea and the largest Christian group there. Christianity has been the majority religion since the 4th century and remains still the largest population. Historically, they spoke Ge'ez, which belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic family. However, the language is now almost extinct, and has been mostly limited to liturgical use since the 10th century. Tewahedo now speak Tigrinya. Most also adhere to the Tewahdo Orthodox Church. Tewahdo is an identity and a religion as well for the adherent of Eritrean Tewahdos. The Eritrean Orthodox Church claims its origins from Philip the Evangelist (Acts of the Apostles, chapter 8). It became the state church of the Kingdom of Aksum under Ezana in the 4th century through the efforts of a Syrian Greek named Frumentius, known in the church as Abba Selama, Kesate Birhan (\\"Father of Peace, Revealer of Light\\"). As a boy, Frumentius had been shipwrecked with his brother Aedesius on the Eritrean coast. The brothers managed to be brought to the royal court, where they rose to positions of influence and converted Emperor Ezana to Christianity, causing him to be baptised. Ezana sent Frumentius to Alexandria to ask the Patriarch, Athanasius of Alexandria, to appoint a bishop for Axum. Athanasius appointed Frumentius himself, who returned to Axum as Bishop with the name of Abune Selama. For fifteen centuries afterward, the pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria always named a Copt to be Abuna \\"metropolitan bishop\\" of the Ethiopian Church. =Jesuit interim= Little else is known of church history down to the period of Jesuit influence, which broke the connection with Egypt. Union with the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria continued even after Arab conquests in Egypt. Abu Saleh records in the 12th century that the patriarch sent letters twice a year to the kings of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and Nubia, until Al Hakim stopped the practice. Coptic patriarch Cyril II sent Severus as bishop, with orders to suppress the practice of polygamy and to enforce observance of canonical consecration for all churches. These examples show the close relations of the two churches concurrent with the Middle Ages. Early in the 16th century the church was brought under the influence of a Portuguese mission. In 1439, in the reign of Zara Yaqob, a religious discussion between Abba Giyorgis and a French visitor had led to the dispatch of an embassy from Ethiopia to the Holy See; but the initiative in the Catholic missions to Ethiopia was taken, not by the Holy See, but by the church in Portugal, as an incident in the struggle with the Muslim Ottoman Empire and Sultanate of Adal for the command of the trade route to India by the Red Sea. In 1507 Matthew (or Matheus), an Armenian, had been sent as Ethiopian envoy to Portugal to ask aid against the Adal Sultanate. In 1520 an embassy under Rodrigo de Lima landed in Ethiopia (by which time Adal Sultanate had been remobilized under Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi). An account of the Portuguese mission, which remained for several years, was written by the chaplain, Francisco √Ålvares. Later, Ignatius of Loyola wished to essay the task of conversion, but this did not happen. Instead, the pope sent out Jo√£o Nunes Barreto as Patriarch of the East Indies, with Andr√©s de Oviedo as bishop; and from Goa envoys (followed by Oviedo) went to Ethiopia. After repeated failures, some measure of success was achieved under Susenyos I, but not until 1624 did the Emperor make a formal declaration of communion with Pope Urban VIII. Susenyos made the Catholic Church the official state church, but was met with heavy resistance and, in 1632, had to abdicate in favour of his son, Fasilides, who promptly restored Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity as the official religion of the country. He then expelled the Society of Jesus in 1633, and in 1665 Fasilides ordered all Jesuit books (the Books of the Franks) be burned. =Colonial era= In the 1920s the Italian colonial power in Eritrea started the first attempts to found a separate Eritrean Orthodox Church. Until then the Orthodox Church in Eritrea was practically part of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, with a strong link to Aksum in Tigray as the traditional centre of the church structure. This was, however, against the interest of the colonizer: Eritrea as a separate colony was supposed to have a church independent from the neighbor's influence, in order to be fully integrated into the colonial system. The separate Eritrean Church was short- lived. When it was still not fully established, the Italians invaded Ethiopia in 1935, and then formed a unified territory, Africa Orientale Italiana, encompassing Eritrea, Ethiopia and Italian Somalia. Eritrea was unified with the northern Ethiopian province of Tigray, and both Orthodox churches unified. This unification remained valid even after the defeat of the Italians and their loss of the whole territory in 1941. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was granted autocephaly by Pope Joseph II of Alexandria, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in 1950. At that time Eritrea was a separate colonial territory under British administration, but nevertheless the Orthodox Church in Eritrea was simply made a division of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, as the British had no interest to strongly separate the Eritrean Highlands from the Ethiopian Highlands, corresponding to their politics of unification of the highlands (with the option of separation of the Muslim lowlands of Eritrea and their inclusion into the British Sudan). =Autocephaly after independence of Eritrea= Following the independence of Eritrea from Ethiopia in 1993, the newly independent Eritrean government appealed to Pope Shenouda III of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria for Eritrean Orthodox autocephaly. Tensions were high between the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and no representative from the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church attended the official recognition of the newly autocephalous body. However, the Ethiopian Church has recognized the autocephalous status of the Church of Eritrea although it objected to the method in which the Coptic Church went about granting it. Eritrea's first two patriarchs were originally archbishops of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and the first Patriarch, Abune Phillipos did visit Addis Ababa during joint efforts by the two churches to explore a possible resolution to a border conflict that had broken out between the two countries in 1998. The two churches, remain in full communion with each other and with the other churches of Oriental Orthodoxy, although the Ethiopian Church, along with the Coptic Orthodox Church have not recognized the deposition of the third Patriarch of Eritrea, and the enthronement of the fourth Patriarch, Abune Dioskoros. The first Patriarch of Eritrea was Abune Phillipos who died in 2002 and was succeeded by Abune Yacob. The reign of Abune Yacob as Patriarch of Eritrea was very brief as he died not long after his enthronement, and he was succeeded by Abune Antonios as 3rd Patriarch of Eritrea. Abune Antonios was elected on 5 March 2004, and enthroned as the third Patriarch of Orthodox Tewahedo Church of Eritrea on 24 April 2004. Pope Shenouda III presided at the ceremony in Asmara, together with the Holy Synod of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and a Coptic Orthodox Church delegation. In August 2005, Abune Antonios, the Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, was confined to a strictly ceremonial role. In a letter dated 13 January 2006, Patriarch Abune Antonios was informed that following several sessions of the church's Holy Synod, he had been formally deposed. In a written response that was widely published, the Patriarch rejected the grounds of his dismissal, questioned the legitimacy of the synod, and excommunicated two signatories to the 13 January 2006 letter, including Yoftahe Dimetros, whom the Patriarch identified as being responsible for the church's recent upheavals. Patriarch Antonios also appealed his case to the Council of the Monasteries of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Abune Antonios was deposed by the Eritrean Holy Synod supposedly under pressure from the Eritrean government; as of 2006 he is under house arrest. Abuna Antonios was replaced by Abune Dioskoros as the 4th Patriarch of the church. The majority believe that Abune Antonios was wrongly deposed against the canon of the Orthodox Church. Many still consider him the legal Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Church. Many Eritrean Orthodox followers disagree with the Eritrean government making decisions in religious matters. The illegally enthroned Patriarch Abuna Dioskoros died on 21 December 2015. No successor has been elected to date. Traditions In common with all Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Western Orthodox churches; the Catholic Church and the Old Catholic churches of the Union of Utrecht, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church professes belief in the seven sacraments of baptism, confirmation, eucharist, confession, the anointing of the sick, matrimony, and holy orders. It regards the first four as being \\"necessary for every believer\\". As is the tradition of the East, non-episcopal clergy may be married at the time of ordination, which is reserved for adult males. In order to demonstrate that a bishop is a member of a synod, there must be at least three bishops taking part in any episcopal ordination. The church holds the ancient Christian belief in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist stating that \\"The consecrated bread and wine are the body and blood of Christ. Jesus Christ is truly, really and substantially present in the consecrated elements. In the Eucharist, we eat the blessed flesh of our Lord and drink His precious blood under the form of bread and wine.\\" Ceremonies are elaborate by western standards. The practice of reconciliation in the sacrament of penance is regarded as strictly personal, and members of the church are encouraged to select a confessor (also referred to as a 'soul father') who is well known to them and with whom they are comfortable. As in other Eastern Christian traditions, the bond of marriage is able to be dissolved, but only on the grounds of adultery. To safeguard the practice of the faith, church members are discouraged from marrying people outside of the Orthodox communion. Church members who undergo a purely civil ceremony are not regarded as sacramentally married. =Biblical canon= The Tewahedo Church Biblical Canon contains 81 books, including almost all of those which are accepted by other Orthodox and Oriental Christians; the exception is the Books of the Maccabees, at least some of which are accepted in the Eastern Orthodox and other Oriental Orthodox churches, but not in the Tewahedo churches (the books of Meqabyan, which are accepted instead, have an etymologically connected name, but rather different content). The Eritrean Orthodox canon and the Ethiopian Orthodox canon are identical. * The Narrower Canon also contains Enoch, Jubilees, and three books of the Meqabyan; * The Broader Canon includes all of the books found in the Narrower Canon, as well as the two Books of the Covenant, Four Books of Sinodos, a Book of Clement, and Didascalia; There have been no printings of the Broader Canon since the beginning of the twentieth century. The Haile Selassie Version of the Bible, which was published in 1962, contains the Narrower Canon. =Language= The Divine Liturgy and other religious services of the Eritrean Church are celebrated in the Ge'ez language, which has been the language of the Church even before the arrival of the Nine Saints (Abba Pantelewon, Abba Gerima (Isaac, or Yeshaq), Abba Aftse, Abba Guba, Abba Alef, Abba Yem‚Äôata, Abba Liqanos, and Abba Sehma), who fled persecution by the Byzantine Emperor after the Council of Chalcedon (451). The Septuagint version was translated into Ge'ez. Sermons are delivered in the local language. =Similarities to Judaism= The Eritrean Church like the Ethiopian Church places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings than one might find in Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, or Protestant churches, and its followers adhere to certain practices that one finds in Orthodox or Conservative Judaism. Eritrean Christians, like some other Eastern Christians, traditionally follow dietary rules that are similar to Jewish Kashrut, specifically with regard to how an animal is slaughtered. Similarly, pork is prohibited, though unlike Rabbinical Kashrut, Ethiopian cuisine does mix dairy products with meat. Women are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; they are also expected to cover their hair with a large scarf (or shash) while in church, as described in 1 Corinthians, chapter 11. As with Orthodox synagogues, men and women are seated separately in the Eritrean church, with men on the left and women on the right (when facing the altar). (Women covering their heads and separation of the sexes in churches officially is common to some other Christian traditions; it is also the rule in some non- Christian religions, Islam and Orthodox Judaism among them). Eritrean Orthodox worshippers remove their shoes when entering a church temple, in accordance with Exodus 3:5 (in which Moses, while viewing the burning bush, was commanded to remove his shoes while standing on holy ground). Furthermore, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church is Sabbatarian, observing the Sabbath on Saturday, in addition to the Lord's Day on Sunday, although more emphasis, because of the Resurrection of Christ, is laid upon Sunday. The Eritrean Orthodox Church calls for male circumcision, with near-universal prevalence among Orthodox men in Eritrea. Patriarchs and bishops of Eritrea After declaration of autocephaly of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church was recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in 1994, the newly established patriarchal seat of Eritrea remained vacant until 1999 when Philipos was elected Abune Phillipos and the first patriarch of Eritrea (1999‚Äì2001). He was succeeded by Abune Yacob in 2002 and Abune Antonios in 2004. Abune Antonios objected the Government actions to the confiscation of church properties, hijacking church offerings, expropriation of tithes and pressing priests and deacons to military services. After he strenuously opposed the government‚Äôs interference in the affairs of the church, the government of Eritrea, which took His Holiness‚Äôs demands as an affront and challenge to its rule, deposed the leader of more than half of the Eritrean population and finally put him under house arrest in 2006. In April 2007, the Synod elected a new patriarch, namely Abune Dioskoros who was the incumbent Patriarch of Eritrea until his death on 21 December 2015, although his reign was disputed by followers of the aged and frail Abune Antonios who endorse the latter as a continuing legitimate Patriarch of the church. List of Abunas: :*Vacant (1994‚Äì1999) *Phillipos (1999‚Äì2001) *Yacob (2002‚Äì2004) *Antonios (2004‚Äì2007) ‚Äì Deposed by the Eritrean government and by the so-called \\"synod\\" against the canon of the Church but still regarded as the legitimate Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church. *Dioskoros (2007‚Äì2015) ‚Äì Passed away.

Among the members of the Eritrean Holy Synod of Bishops, there is one member who is also a member of the Coptic Holy Synod, namely Makarios, Bishop of the Eritrean Church in the United States and in the diaspora.

Working in a wide variety of mediums, his oeuvre is among the most diverse and prolific in all of modern art. He is best known for his series of paintings on legends from Australian history, most famously Ned Kelly, the bushranger and outlaw. Nolan's stylised depiction of Kelly's armour has become an icon of Australian art. Biography=Early life= Sidney Nolan was born in Carlton, at that time an inner working-class suburb of Melbourne, on 22 April 1917. He was the eldest of four children. His parents, Sidney (a tram driver) and Dora, were both fifth generation Australians of Irish descent. Nolan later moved with his family to the bayside suburb of St Kilda. He attended the Brighton Road State School and then Brighton Technical School and left school aged 14. He enrolled at the Prahran Technical College (now part of Swinburne University), Department of Design and Crafts, in a course which he had already begun part- time by correspondence. From 1933, at the age of 16, he began almost six years of work for Fayrefield Hats, Abbotsford, producing advertising and display stands with spray paints and dyes. From 1934 he attended night classes sporadically at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School. =Years at Heide (1941‚Äì1947)= Heide I, where Nolan painted the majority of his early Ned Kelly works Nolan was a close friend of the arts patrons John and Sunday Reed, and is regarded as one of the leading figures of the so-called \\"Heide Circle\\" that also included Albert Tucker, Joy Hester, Arthur Boyd and John Perceval. Boyd and Perceval were members of the Boyd artistic family who were centered at \\"Open Country\\", Murrumbeena. In 1938, he met and married his first wife, graphic designer Elizabeth Paterson, with whom he had a daughter, but his marriage soon broke up because of his increasing involvement with the Reeds. He joined the Angry Penguins in the 1940s, after deserting from the army during World War II; indeed he was an editor of the Angry Penguins magazine and painted the cover for the Ern Malley edition published in June 1944. The Ern Malley hoax poems were seen by Nolan and Sunday Reed as being uncannily prescient in touching on their own personal circumstances.Rainey, David. Ern Malley: The Hoax and Beyond. Melbourne: Heide Museum of Modern Art, 2009. , pp. 58-63. Nolan later recalled how he and Sunday felt they ‚Äòhad a very intimate relationship with the poems‚Äô, observing that Petit Testament ‚Äòwas very much to do with our own lives. . . the poetry was tragic. . . and as it turned out our own lives did have a tragic outcome. ..‚Äô The Malley poems remained a real presence to him throughout his life. He painted and drew literally hundreds of Malley-themed works and in 1975 said it inspired him to paint his first Ned Kelly series: \\"It made me take the risk of putting against the Australian bush an utterly strange object.\\"Pearce, Barry. Sidney Nolan. Sydney: Art Gallery of New South Wales, 2007. , pp. 96‚Äì97 He lived for some time at the Reeds' home, \\"Heide\\" outside Melbourne (now the Heide Museum of Modern Art). Here he painted the first of his famous, iconic \\"Ned Kelly\\" series, reportedly with input from Sunday Reed. Nolan also conducted an open affair with Sunday Reed but subsequently married John Reed's sister, Cynthia in 1948 after Sunday refused to leave her husband. He had lived in a m√©nage √† trois with the Reeds for several years and after his marriage he continued to see them and visited Heide at least once during their lifetimes. The years there together have been seen as a dominating factor in the subsequent lives of them all. In November 1976, Cynthia Nolan ended her life by taking an overdose of sleeping pills in a London hotel.Patrick White, Letters, ed, David Marr, p. 487, footnote 52 In 1978, Nolan married Mary n√©e Boyd (1926-2016),Dewi Cooke, \\"Lady Mary Nolan, widow of painter Sidney Nolan, dies in Wales\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 18 April 2016. Retrieved 19 April 2016 youngest daughter within the Boyd family and previously married to John Perceval. =Career= The Trial, held at the National Gallery of Australia, is one of 27 paintings comprising Nolan's 1946‚Äì47 Ned Kelly series. Nolan painted a wide range of personal interpretations of historical and legendary figures, including explorers Burke and Wills, and Eliza Fraser. With time his paintings of Mrs Fraser came to be associated with his growing animus towards Sunday Reed. However, when first painted on Fraser Island in 1947 after he had left Heide, he remained on friendly terms with the Reeds and sent them photos of the works for their approval. Indeed, he gave one Fraser Island painting to Sunday Reed as a Christmas gift that year. Probably his most famous work is a series of stylised descriptions of the bushranger Ned Kelly in the Australian bush. Nolan left the famous 1946‚Äì47 series of 27 Ned Kellys at \\"Heide\\", when he left it in emotionally charged circumstances. Although he once wrote to Sunday Reed to tell her to take what she wanted, he subsequently demanded all his works back. Sunday Reed returned 284 other paintings and drawings to Nolan, but she refused to give up the 25 remaining Kellys, partly because she saw the works as fundamental to the proposed Heide Museum of Modern Art. Possibly also because she collaborated with Nolan on the paintings. Eventually, she gave them to the National Gallery of Australia in 1977 and this resolved the dispute. Nolan's Ned Kelly series follow the main sequence of the Kelly story. However Nolan did not intend the series to be an authentic depiction of these events. Rather, these episodes/series became the setting for the artist's meditations upon universal themes of injustice, love and betrayal. The Kelly saga was also a way for Nolan to paint the Australian landscape in new ways, with the story giving meaning to the place. Although the Depression and World War II happened during this period, Nolan decided to concentrate on something other than people struggling in life. Nolan wanted to create and define episodes in Australian nationalism, to retell the story of a hero. A hero which now has become a metaphor for humankind‚Äîthe fighter, the victim, and the hero‚Äîresisting tyranny with a passion for freedom. Nolan recognised that the conceptual image of the black square (Kelly's helmet and armour) had been part of modern art since World War I. Nolan just placed a pair of eyes into Kelly's helmet which animates its formal shape. As in most of the series, Kelly's steel head guard dominates the composition. Nolan also concentrates on the Australian outback and shows a different landscape in nearly every painting. Nolan's paintings give the audience an insight into the history of Australia but also show others from the world how beautiful Australia is. The intensity of the colours of the land and bush along with its overall smooth texture help create harmony between legend, symbol and visual impact. Kelly is in the centre of the painting but the colours around him help make him stand out. It's a very simplistic picture but highlights that Ned Kelly is an Australian icon. drought in outback Queensland. His photographs of desiccated animals were a catalyst for his later drought paintings.Digital Collections - Drought photographs, Queensland, 1952, National Library of Australia. Retrieved 10 November 2012. Nolan never relied upon one style or technique, but rather experimented throughout his lifetime with many different methods of application, and also devised some of his own. Nolan was inspired by children's art and modernist painting of the early 20th century. During this time many younger artists were veering towards abstraction, Nolan remained committed to the figurative potential of painting. In terms of art history Nolan rediscovered the Australian landscape (Australia has not been an easy country to paint). His love of literature is seen as visually evident in his work. Other key influences were the modernist artists such as Paul C√©zanne, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Henri Rousseau. Locally, the arrival of the Russian artist Danila Vassilieff in Melbourne, with his simple and direct art, was significant for Nolan. In his series, Kelly is a metaphor for Nolan himself. Nolan, like the bushranger, was a fugitive from the law. In July 1944, facing the possibility that he would be sent to Papua New Guinea on front-line duty, Nolan went absent without leave. He adopted the alias Robin Murray, a name suggested by Sunday Reed, whose affectionate nickname for him was \\"Robin Redbreast\\". So when he created this series he viewed himself as the misunderstood hero/artist like the protagonist, Kelly. \\"Nolan like this Kelly figure has also been a hero, a victim, a man who armoured himself against Australia and who faced it, conquered it, lost it‚Ä¶. ambiguity personified.\\"The Bulletin magazine, 29 December 1962. Nolan's Ned Kelly series is one of the greatest sequences of Australian paintings of the 20th century. His simplified depiction of Kelly in his armour has become an iconic Australian image. In 1949, when the series was exhibited at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris, the museum's director Jean Cassou called the works \\"a striking contribution to modern art\\" and that Nolan \\"creates in us a wonder of something new being born\\".Turnbull, Clive. \\"Paris likes Ned Kelly paintings\\".

Paintings of Dimboola landscapes by Sidney Nolan, who was stationed in the area while on army duty in World War II, can be found in the National Gallery of Victoria. In 1951, Nolan moved to London, England.The Sidney Nolan Trust. The Rodd, Presteigne, Herefordshire, England. (Leaflet) www.sidneynolantrust.org He travelled in Europe, spending a year in 1956 painting themes based on Greek Mythology while in Greece. In Paris, he studied engraving and lithography with S. W. Hayter at Studio 17t two years there. He became friends with the poet Robert Lowell and produced illustrations for some of his books. Nolan was a prolific book cover illustrator, his images enhancing the dust jackets of over 70 publications. In 1965, Nolan completed a large mural (20 m by 3.6 m) depicting the 1854 Eureka Stockade, rendered in enamelled jewellery on 1.5 tonnes of heavy gauge copper. Nolan employed the \\"finger-and-thumb\\" drawing technique of Indigenous Australian sandpainters to create the panoramic scene. Commissioned by economist H. C. Coombs, the mural is located at the entrance to the Reserve Bank of Australia's Melbourne office on Collins Street.Nolan Eureka Mural, National Trust of Australia. Retrieved 5 December 2012. During the period of 1968-1970, Nolan embarked on the creation of a monumental mural entitled Paradise Garden. This project consisted of 1,320 floral designs split into three subsections that were created using crayon and dyes. The intent of the subsections was to show the lifecycles of the plants, starting with the primeval plants emerging from the mud, transitioning to their full burst of colour in springtime, and the completion of the life cycle with the withering plants returning to the earth.Arts Centre Melbourne, In England, Nolan attended the Aldeburgh Festival and become influenced by the organiser and composer Benjamin Britten, exhibiting paintings at the festivals. He continued to travel widely in Europe, Africa, China, Australia, and even Antarctica. = Death = Nolan died in London on 28 November 1992 at the age of 75, he was survived by his wife and two children. He was buried in the Eastern part of Highgate Cemetery, London. Work The Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania was built to accommodate Nolan's Snake (1970‚Äì72), a giant Rainbow Serpent mural made of 1,620 individual paintings. =Stage designs= Nolan's lifelong engagement with the theatre began in 1939 when he was commissioned to create d√©cor for French ballet dancer Serge Lifar's revised version of Icare. Lifar, then on tour in Australia with the Original Ballet Russe, offered Nolan the job after a chance encounter with his abstract work. Icare premiered on 16 February 1940 at the Theatre Royal in Sydney. In 1964, Robert Helpmann enlisted Nolan to design the set and costumes for his ballet The Display. Set at a bush picnic, the piece relates the mating rituals of the lyrebird to the masculine posturing of Australian males. Nolan created a series of green-blue gauze panels to evoke the filtered light of the forest. One contemporary critic remarked that Nolan's d√©cor \\"not merely recreates the haunt of the lyrebird. It is the deep, rich mysterious gloom of a sunlight shafted Australian rainforest with the pillars of its ghostly white gums rising through its depths.\\"The Display (1964), Trove. Retrieved 10 November 2012. Honours and awards In 1963, Nolan was appointed CBE. In 1981, Nolan was appointed a Knight Bachelor for service to art, despite his war desertion. He received the Order of Merit (OM) in 1983. In 1983, Nolan settled in Herefordshire. The Sidney Nolan Trust, chaired by Lord Lipsey, was established in 1985 to support artists and musicians, and provide exhibition space for works by Nolan and others at The Rodd, north of Kington, Herefordshire. He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 1988 having declined being made an Officer in 1975. In 1975, Sir John Kerr, the then Governor-General, wrote to the Queen's then Private Secretary, Sir Martin Charteris, to inform him of Nolan's decision to decline. Kerr indicated in his letter that he thought Nolan should have been offered the rank of Companion instead and that he had intended to convey his view to Sir Garfield Barwick, the inaugural Chair of the Order of Australia Council, but that Barwick had already sent Nolan the letter asking whether Barwick would decline the honour of AO. Kerr speculated to Charteris that, having been made CBE in the 1960s, being made an AO, \\"...may have seemed to him no great advancement.\\" He was also elected an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a member of the Royal Academy of Arts.

It took place in the Sala Nervi (also called Paul VI Audience Hall) at the Vatican on April 7, 1994. The concert was conceived and created at the direct behest of Pope John Paul II by the American conductor Gilbert Levine, who had first met the Pope after he was appointed artistic director and conductor of the Krakow Philharmonic, in December 1987. Pope John Paul II, Rav Elio Toaff, the Chief Rabbi of Italy, and Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, President of Italy jointly presided over the event, and viewed it from positions of equal honor.http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/StaticPages/HolocaustScans/HiRes/1947/19470008000113 Event and program The event was attended by 7,500 invited guests, including several hundred survivors of the Holocaust, from around the world. The six candle Holocaust candelabra was lit in the concert hall by six survivors and their descendants. One of these was Margit Raab Kalina, Maestro Levine's mother-in-law, a survivor of P≈Çasz√≥w, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Bergen- Belsen.Raab Kalina, Margit. Surviving a Thousand Deaths (1939-1945) in Stolen Youth: Five Women's Survival in the Holocaust. Yad Vashem & Holocaust Survivors Memoirs Project, 2005. The candelabra burned throughout the performance to demonstrate, as the Pope stated in his discourse at the end of the concert that, \\"The walls of this hall have no limits. The victims: fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters and friends, are here with you, they are with us. They will never be forgotten.\\" As the Pope also stated: It was like a night of \\"common meditation and shared prayer\\" in the Vatican. The program included Schubert Psalm 92, Bernstein Chichester Psalms (1965) (soloist: Gregory Daniel Rodriguez), Bernstein Symphony 3 \\"Kaddish\\" (1961-3) excerpt (narrator: Richard Dreyfuss), Bruch Kol Nidre, Op. 47 (soloist: Lynn Harrell), and Beethoven Symphony 9 in D Minor, Op. 125, Movement 3 \\"Adagio molto e cantabile.\\" Selection of orchestra Owing to Prague's long history of flourishing Jewish culture, and the terrible toll on that population during the Holocaust, the concert had been envisioned, at first, as a concert with the Czech Philharmonic. When it was proposed however, Gerd Albrecht, that orchestra's principal conductor, refused to allow the group to participate. This sparked a national outrage, including a denunciation of Albrecht's decision by the President of the Czech Republic and famed human rights leader, V√°clav Havel. Albrecht prevailed in the short term, and the Czech Philharmonic did not perform at the concert in April 1994. Even after the concert, the Czech Philharmonic controversy endured, and Albrecht was forced to resign his position as principal conductor in 1996. Following Albrecht's decision to block the participation of the Czech Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra of London immediately accepted the invitation to participate in the concert. It was joined by the Cappella Giulia of Saint Peter's Basilica and the Chorus of the Accademia Filarmonica Romana. Legacy The concert is considered, along with the first-ever Papal visit to a synagogue, the Great Synagogue of Rome, in 1986, and the Papal visit to Israel in 2000, to be among the signal events in Catholic-Jewish relations during the 26-year-long pontificate of Pope John Paul II. The concert also followed the recognition of the State of Israel by the Holy See little more than three months earlier, in December 1993. The New York Times reported that in light of the concert, \\"[s]ome Jews said the Pope had revived the revolution in Catholic-Jewish relations set in motion by Pope John XXIII and the Second Vatican Council.\\" The concert was broadcast in Italy by RAI (Italian Television), to 52 countries around the world via Eurovision, and in the U.S. on PBS. The PBS broadcast was produced by John Walker of WNET Thirteen (New York). It was also released on CD (produced by Heinz Wildhagen) for Justice Records, and on video in a documentary film directed by Hart Perry for Rhino, a Time-Warner company. The event was reported on worldwide, in print, on radio, and on television. For his contributions in creating and conducting this event, Gilbert Levine, was invested at the direct gift of the Pontiff as a Knight-Commander of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of Saint Gregory the Great, in a ceremony in Paris presided over by Jean-Marie Cardinal Lustiger. Levine's was the first-ever Pontifical Knighthood accorded an American Jew in the history of the Vatican.

It is located at the Gulf of ƒ∞zmit in the Sea of Marmara, about east of Istanbul, on the northwestern part of Anatolia. The city center has a population of 300,611 (2011 census). The population of the province (including rural areas) is 1,459,772. Unlike other provinces in Turkey, apart from Istanbul, the whole province is included within the municipality of the metropolitan center. Nicomedia was the eastern and most senior capital city of the Roman Empire between 286 and 324, during the Tetrarchy introduced by Diocletian. Following Constantine the Great's victory over co-emperor Licinius at the Battle of Chrysopolis in 324, Nicomedia served as an interim capital city for Nova Roma. Name ƒ∞zmit derives from the Ancient Greek name of the city, Nicomedia (), prefixed with ŒµŒπœÇ 'to' (similarly to ƒ∞stanbul). Names used in English prior to official Turkish Latinization include Ismid, Iskimid, and Isnikmid.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th ed., s.v. Geography The geographical location of ƒ∞zmit is between 40¬∞-41¬∞ N and 29¬∞-31¬∞ E, surrounded by the Gulf of ƒ∞zmit at south, Istanbul and the Sea of Marmara at west, the Black Sea at north, and Sakarya at east. The city is mostly built on hill slopes because of the cramped area, while flat plains surround the gulf, near the sea. This topographic structure divided the city into two parts. The first was created on flat plains, where the city center is. The railway and highway networks pass from this area which is close to the Sea of Marmara. The second part was built on hills, with many historic houses from the Ottoman period in the old quarters.

After being destroyed, it was rebuilt and founded by Nicomedes I of Bithynia in 264 BC under the name of Nicomedia. It remained one of the most important cities in northwestern Asia Minor. Hannibal came to Nicomedia in his final years and committed suicide in nearby Libyssa (Gebze). The historian Arrian was born there. Nicomedia was the metropolis of Bithynia under the Roman Empire (see Nicaea), and Diocletian made it the eastern capital city of the Roman Empire in 286 when he introduced the Tetrarchy system. Nicomedia remained as the eastern (and most senior) capital of the Roman Empire until Licinius was defeated by Constantine the Great in 324. Constantine mainly resided in Nicomedia as his interim capital city for the next six years; until in 330 he declared the nearby Byzantium as Nova Roma, which eventually became known as Constantinople. Constantine died in a royal villa at the vicinity of Nicomedia in 337. Owing to its position at the convergence of the Asiatic roads leading to the new capital, Nicomedia retained its importance even after the foundation of Constantinople. At 451, the local bishopric was promoted to a Metropolitan see under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Until the late 11th century it was under Byzantine rule. Then it was captured by Seljuk Turks. Soon after it was returned to Byzantine sovereignty as a consequence of the successes of the First Crusade. After capture of Constantinople in 1204 the city, with most of the Bithynia province, became a part of the Latin Empire. It was recaptured by the Byzantines around 1235 and stayed in its borders until first half of the 14th century. The city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1337. Byzantine rule renewed in 1402 but the Ottomans reconquered it in 1419. Under Ottoman rule, it was the capital of the Sanjak of Kocaeli. In the early 20th century, it remained the seat of a pasha, a Greek metropolitan, and an Armenian archbishop. ƒ∞zmit was occupied by the United Kingdom on 6 July 1920 during the Turkish War of Independence. The British left it to Greece on 27 October 1920. ƒ∞zmit was re-taken by the Turks on 28 June 1921.Ionian Vision: Greece in Asia Minor, 1919-1922, Michael Llewellyn-Smith, page 215, 1998 As of 1920, the British reported that the city had a population of about 13,000. In 1920‚Äì1921 atrocities were committed in the city and its surroundings during the Greco- Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922) against the civilian population. An Allied report (on 1 June 1921) stated that a large number of excesses were committed by both sides during the last year, while the Turkish atrocities in the Izmit peninsula \\"have been more considerable and ferocious than those on the part of the Greeks\\". The 7.6 earthquake of 17 August 1999 devastated the region with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The shock killed more than 17,000 people and left half a million homeless. It took several years for the city to recover from this disaster, and remnants remain visible.

At that time, a company called Vickers built a temporary dock, bringing a small export business to the area. The British described the port as having little business as of 1920. During the sanjak period of ƒ∞zmit, the forested regions of the area were devastated by deforestation. The wood in the region of ƒ∞zmit was used to produce charcoal, primarily. During the 1920s, the area was also known for manufacturing linen. Factories were rare during that time, so most linen was handmade. It was described as being \\"coarse\\" and as being in high demand in Turkey as of 1920. ƒ∞zmit was the home of two Turkish Army and Navy uniform factories. One made fez hats and the other made cloth. The area made carpet and embroidery, made by mainly Christian women. ƒ∞zmit has a large oil refinery and major paper and cement factories. Ford Motor Company has a plant here in a joint venture with Otosan, assembling the Transit/Tourneo (including the new V362 Transit/Tourneo Custom since late 2012) and Transit/Tourneo Connect vans. With Ford's Southampton Assembly Plant closing in July 2013, and the launch of the new Otosan only V363 Transit in 2014, ƒ∞zmit will be the sole producer of Ford Transit vans for Europe. It is also a transportation hub, being on the main highway and railway lines between Istanbul and Ankara and having a major port. In the past few years the province has developed into a growth point for the Turkish automotive industry, receiving investments from Ford, Hyundai, Honda and Isuzu. Tyre and rubber products are produced to world-class standard (Goodyear, Pirelli, Lassa and Bridgestone). As of today, Kocaeli province has attracted more than 1200 industrial investments, 108 of which have been established with international capital. Turkey's largest enterprise, the T√ºpra≈ü Petroleum Refinery Plant, is in Kocaeli, containing altogether 27% of the national chemical products industry, including petrochemical products. Eighteen of the 100 largest enterprises of Turkey are in Kocaeli and contribute to around 17%-18% of the national tax revenues. Financial Times affiliated Foreign Direct Investment magazine nominated Kocaeli (the province of which ƒ∞zmit is the capital) among the 25 European Regions of the Future for 2006‚Äì2007.fDi Magazine: European Regions of the Future The city was chosen along with Adana for Turkey, which scored the highest points for cost effectiveness against Kocaeli's wider infrastructure, while Adana and Kocaeli tied on points for human resources and quality of life. The famous Turkish traditional sweet Pi≈ümaniye is a product of ƒ∞zmit and the Kocaeli Province. Transport An overpass in ƒ∞zmit. Osman Gazi Bridge in ƒ∞zmit Bay is one of the longest suspension bridge in the world. Located along the commercially-active Black Sea and Marmara Sea shorelines, Kocaeli boasts 5 ports and 35 industrial docks, making it an important communications center, as well as Anatolia's farthest inland contact point and a gateway to global markets. The main transportation routes, the D100 highway and the Trans European Motorway which connects Europe with Asia, along with railway lines, form an intercontinental passage network. ƒ∞zmit Central railway station is one of the busiest in Turkey, built in 1977 to replace the original station.

Its vicinity to Istanbul's two international airports (Sabiha G√∂k√ßen International Airport and Atat√ºrk International Airport) which are away, respectively, from ƒ∞zmit's city center, provides national and international connections. On 1 March 1958, , a small passenger ferry sailing between ƒ∞zmit and Deƒüirmendere sank due to lodos weather. 272 people died including 38 students and seven crew. 37 passengers and two crew survived the disaster. Education Kocaeli University (KOU) was established in the city in 1992. The university has more than 50,000 students. It has established a department of international relations that monitors Bologna developments closely and oversees KOU's participation in the Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci student mobility schemes. With membership in the European University Association, KOU is aiming for greater international recognition of its academic work. The university, while focusing on technical and engineering subjects, offers an extensive selection of courses in social sciences and arts as well. Some steps toward certification by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) are being taken by the Faculty of Engineering, such as adaptation of course content in engineering majors. Climate ƒ∞zmit has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa), with considerable Mediterranean influences. Summers are hot and very humid, and the average maximum temperature is around in July and August, although temperatures often exceed in June, July, August and even September. Winters are cool and damp, and the lowest average minimum temperature is around in January. Precipitation is high and fairly evenly distributed the year round; it is heaviest in autumn, winter, spring. Highest temperature was in July 2000. Lowest temperature was in February 1929. Highest snow thickness was 90 cm (35.4 inches) in February 1929.

She was a member of the Kennedy family, the eighth of nine children and youngest daughter born to Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald. Her siblings included President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver. She was also the sister-in-law of Jacqueline Kennedy. As Ambassador to Ireland, Smith was reportedly instrumental in the Northern Ireland peace process as President Bill Clinton's representative in Dublin. She was heavily criticized after urging the U.S. State Department to grant a visa to Sinn F√©in President Gerry Adams, although her family said this step influenced the Provisional IRA in its declaration of a ceasefire in 1994. However, Adams has said it was President Clinton who led the Northern Ireland peace process and that during the process, Smith relied on advice from an influential Belfast priest. President of Ireland Mary McAleese conferred honorary Irish citizenship on Smith in 1998 in recognition of her service to the country. Smith was the founder of Very Special Arts (VSA), an internationally recognized non-profit dedicated to creating a society where people with disabilities can engage with the arts. In 2011, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, by President Barack Obama for her work with VSA and with people with disabilities. Early years Jean Ann Kennedy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on her elder sister Kathleen's eighth birthday. Kennedy was the eighth of nine children born to Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Kennedy. Her other siblings were Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., U.S. President John F. Kennedy, Rose Marie Kennedy, Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Patricia Kennedy Lawford, U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy. She has been described as having been the shyest and most guarded of the Kennedy children. She attended Manhattanville College (at the time a Society of the Sacred Heart school, and still located in Purchase, New York), where she befriended future sisters-in-law Ethel Skakel (who married Jean's older brother Robert in 1950) and Joan Bennett (who married Jean's younger brother Ted in 1958). Kennedy graduated from Manhattanville in 1949. Career=Political involvement= Kennedy (known as Jean Kennedy Smith following her 1956 marriage to Stephen Edward Smith) was intricately involved with the political career of her older brother John. She worked on his 1946 Congressional campaign, his 1952 Senate campaign, and ultimately his presidential campaign in 1960. She and her siblings helped Kennedy knock on doors in primary states such as Texas and Wisconsin and on the campaign trail played the role of sister more than volunteer, citing her parents' family lesson of \\"working together for something.\\" Smith and her husband were present at The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, during the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy after he had won the 1968 California Democratic primary. =Very Special Arts= In 1974, Smith founded Very Special Arts, now known as the Department of VSA and Accessibility at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. VSA provides arts and education programming for youth and adults with disabilities. As of 2011, VSA's programs reportedly served \\"some 276,000 students in 43 states and 52 countries\\". Smith traveled extensively throughout the world on behalf of VSA to advocate for greater inclusion in the arts for people with disabilities. Her book, Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists, co-written with George Plimpton, was published by Random House in April 1993. =U.S. Ambassador to Ireland= In 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed Smith the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, continuing a legacy of diplomacy begun by her father, who was the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom during the administration of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. As ambassador, Smith played a pivotal role in the Northern Ireland peace process. As a demonstration of her ecumenical views, on at least one occasion she received communion in a cathedral of the Church of Ireland, an autonomous province of the Anglican Communion. President of Ireland Mary McAleese conferred honorary Irish citizenship on Smith in 1998 in recognition of her service to the country. During a ceremony, McAleese praised Smith's \\"fixedness of purpose\\". Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern told Smith, \\"You have helped bring about a better life for everyone throughout Ireland.\\" On July 4, 1998, about three months after the historic Good Friday Agreement of April 10, 1998, Smith retired as ambassador to Ireland. Sinn F√©in controversy In 1994, Smith came to the forefront of American foreign policy when she championed the granting of a U.S. visa to Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams. Smith was lauded for her work in the region, but was criticized for supporting the visa. Her family have said this was a key step in the success of the peace process in the years that followed. In her brother Ted's memoir, he described that \\"Jean was convinced that Adams no longer believed that continuing the armed struggle was the way to achieve the IRA's objective of a united Ireland,\\" and that \\"It took only a couple of hours' conversation with Jean after we landed to discover what was the most important thing on her mind ‚Äì the opportunity for a breakthrough in the Northern Ireland stalemate.\\"Kennedy, Edward M. True Compass: A Memoir. New York: Twelve, 2009. Print. However, Irish Central later acknowledged that President Clinton had in fact made a promise during his presidential campaign to grant Adams a visa.https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/irish-america-hall-of-fame-jean- kennedy-smith-117752328-237375001 Adams also told the BBC in 2019 that Clinton led the Northern Ireland peace process and that during the peace process, Smith was following advice from west Belfast priest Father Alex Reid, stating \\"He [Fr Reid] was talking to her [Kennedy-Smith] on the side and she was talking to her brother Teddy [Kennedy].\\" In March 1996, Smith was reprimanded by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher for retaliating against two Foreign Service Officers at the Embassy of the United States in Dublin who had objected to her recommendation to the U.S. government to grant Adams the visa and had sent in a \\"Dissent Channel\\" message. The Foreign Service Journal called the U.S. State Department's report on the matter \\"scathingly critical\\".Gilbert, Richard (July 1996). \\"Dissent in Dublin ‚Äì For 2 FSOs, Cable Drew Retribution And Frustration\\" .

Smith was also allegedly to have violated U.S. conflict-of-interest laws. The United States Department of Justice issued a press release on September 22, 2000, announcing that she had paid US$5,000 in a civil settlement to resolve the allegations. In 1998, in support of Irish President Mary McAleese, Smith took communion in an Irish Protestant cathedral in Dublin, in defiance of her Roman Catholic church. Awards and later work Kennedy Smith (left) with Victoria Reggie Kennedy in 2008 Smith won several awards for her work in Ireland and in the disability community. She was awarded honorary citizenship by the Government of Ireland in 1998 and in 2007, Smith received the Gold Medal Award from the √âire Society of Boston, for her peace efforts in Northern Ireland and for her humanitarian work with disabled children. In 2009, Smith and Ted Kennedy were honored with the Tipperary Peace Prize for their support of the peace process in Northern Ireland. In February 2011, President Barack Obama awarded Smith the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, for her work with people with disabilities. On March 15, 2011, Smith was inducted into Irish America magazine's Irish America Hall of Fame. Smith was listed as Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith in the credits of the 2012 movie Lincoln for portraying a \\"woman shouter\\". Memoir In October 2016, Smith published The Nine of Us: Growing Up Kennedy, a memoir of the Kennedy clan. Personal life On May 19, 1956, Jean Kennedy married businessman Stephen Edward Smith in a small chapel of the Roman Catholic St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York. The Smiths maintained a lower profile than some other members of the extended Kennedy family. The Smiths had two sons, attorney Stephen Edward Smith Jr. and physician William Kennedy Smith. They adopted two daughters, Amanda Smith and Kym Smith. Stephen Edward Smith died of cancer on August 19, 1990. The following year, their younger son, William, was accused of rape in Florida, but was acquitted after a highly publicized trial. Smith's elder sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver died on August 11, 2009. Smith did not attend Eunice's funeral on August 14, choosing to stay with their brother Ted, who was ill; he died on August 25, leaving her as the last surviving child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy. Smith attended Ted Kennedy's funeral on August 29. Smith died at her home in Manhattan on June 17, 2020, at the age of 92, being the last of John F. Kennedy's siblings to die and the longest-lived Kennedy child.

The headquarters is in Cochrane, Alberta. History Dissatisfaction among some Regular Baptists in British Columbia would eventually lead to the establishment of the Canadian Convention of Southern Baptists (CCSB). Some churches participated in the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, but this affiliation proved unsatisfactory. Contact with the Southern Baptists, especially through the Northwest Baptist Bible College, increased the interest of Canadian churches in the Southern Baptist educational and evangelistic programs. In the fall of 1952, Northwest began using the Teacher Training Course of the SBC. Early in 1953, a pastor's conference recommended the Sunday School program of the Southern Baptist Sunday School Board. Regular Baptists in British Columbia were divided over the \\"Southern Baptist issue\\". In October 1953, the Emmanuel Baptist Church of Vancouver, British Columbia joined the Baptist General Convention of Oregon-Washington, an affiliate of the Southern Baptist Convention, while also maintaining membership in the Regular Baptist Convention of British Columbia. The Oregon-Washington Convention determined it would assist affiliated churches, but would not initiate any new work in Canada. At the British Columbia Regular Baptist Convention in 1955, several resolutions were directed against the Emmanuel Church (now called Kingcrest Southern Baptist Church) and the Southern Baptists. This caused Kingcrest and four other churches to withdraw from the B. C. Convention and affiliate with only the Southern Baptists in the northwest. Though these Canadian churches were members of the Oregon-Washington Convention, they were unable to affiliate directly with the SBC, because of questions relating to the wording of the SBC Constitution.

The process proceeds in the opposite direction to forward genetic screens of classical genetics. While forward genetics seeks to find the genetic basis of a phenotype or trait, reverse genetics seeks to find what phenotypes are controlled by particular genetic sequences. Automated DNA sequencing generates large volumes of genomic sequence data relatively rapidly. Many genetic sequences are discovered in advance of other, less easily obtained, biological information. Reverse genetics attempts to connect a given genetic sequence with specific effects on the organism. Techniques used In order to learn the influence a sequence has on phenotype, or to discover its biological function, researchers can engineer a change or disrupt the DNA. After this change has been made a researcher can look for the effect of such alterations in the whole organism. There are several different methods of reverse genetics: =Directed deletions and point mutations= Site- directed mutagenesis is a sophisticated technique that can either change regulatory regions in the promoter of a gene or make subtle codon changes in the open reading frame to identify important amino residues for protein function. Wild-type Physcomitrella patens (A) and Knockout mosses (B-D): Deviating phenotypes induced in gene-disruption library transformants. Physcomitrella wild-type and transformed plants were grown on minimal Knop medium to induce differentiation and development of gametophores. For each plant, an overview (upper row; scale bar corresponds to 1 mm) and a close-up (bottom row; scale bar equals 0.5 mm) are shown. A: Haploid wild-type moss plant completely covered with leafy gametophores and close-up of wild-type leaf. B‚ÄìD: Different mutants. Alternatively, the technique can be used to create null alleles so that the gene is not functional. For example, deletion of a gene by gene targeting (gene knockout) can be done in some organisms, such as yeast, mice and moss. Unique among plants, in Physcomitrella patens, gene knockout via homologous recombination to create knockout moss (see figure) is nearly as efficient as in yeast. In the case of the yeast model system directed deletions have been created in every non-essential gene in the yeast genome. In the case of the plant model system huge mutant libraries have been created based on gene disruption constructs. In gene knock-in, the endogenous exon is replaced by an altered sequence of interest. In some cases conditional alleles can be used so that the gene has normal function until the conditional allele is activated. This might entail 'knocking in' recombinase sites (such as lox or frt sites) that will cause a deletion at the gene of interest when a specific recombinase (such as CRE, FLP) is induced. Cre or Flp recombinases can be induced with chemical treatments, heat shock treatments or be restricted to a specific subset of tissues. Another technique that can be used is TILLING. This is a method that combines a standard and efficient technique of mutagenesis with a chemical mutagen such as ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) with a sensitive DNA-screening technique that identifies point mutations in a target gene. =Gene silencing= The discovery of gene silencing using double stranded RNA, also known as RNA interference (RNAi), and the development of gene knockdown using Morpholino oligos, have made disrupting gene expression an accessible technique for many more investigators. This method is often referred to as a gene knockdown since the effects of these reagents are generally temporary, in contrast to gene knockouts which are permanent. RNAi creates a specific knockout effect without actually mutating the DNA of interest. In C. elegans, RNAi has been used to systematically interfere with the expression of most genes in the genome. RNAi acts by directing cellular systems to degrade target messenger RNA (mRNA). RNAi interference, specifically gene silencing, has become a useful tool to silence the expression of genes and identify and analyze their loss-of- function phenotype. When mutations occur in alleles, the function which it represents and encodes also is mutated and lost; this is generally called a loss-of-function mutation. The ability to analyze the loss-of-function phenotype allows analysis of gene function when there is no access to mutant alleles. While RNA interference relies on cellular components for efficacy (e.g. the Dicer proteins, the RISC complex) a simple alternative for gene knockdown is Morpholino antisense oligos. Morpholinos bind and block access to the target mRNA without requiring the activity of cellular proteins and without necessarily accelerating mRNA degradation. Morpholinos are effective in systems ranging in complexity from cell-free translation in a test tube to in vivo studies in large animal models. =Interference using transgenes= A molecular genetic approach is the creation of transgenic organisms that overexpress a normal gene of interest. The resulting phenotype may reflect the normal function of the gene. Alternatively it is possible to overexpress mutant forms of a gene that interfere with the normal (wildtype) gene's function. For example, over-expression of a mutant gene may result in high levels of a non-functional protein resulting in a dominant negative interaction with the wildtype protein. In this case the mutant version will out compete for the wildtype proteins partners resulting in a mutant phenotype. Other mutant forms can result in a protein that is abnormally regulated and constitutively active ('on' all the time). This might be due to removing a regulatory domain or mutating a specific amino residue that is reversibly modified (by phosphorylation, methylation, or ubiquitination). Either change is critical for modulating protein function and often result in informative phenotypes.  Vaccine synthesis  Reverse genetics plays a large role in vaccine synthesis. Vaccines can be created by engineering novel genotypes of infectious viral strains which diminish their pathogenic potency enough to facilitate immunity in a host. The reverse genetics approach to vaccine synthesis utilizes known viral genetic sequences to create a desired phenotype: a virus with both a weakened pathological potency and a similarity to the current circulating virus strain. Reverse genetics provides a convenient approach to the traditional method of creating inactivated vaccines, viruses which have been killed using heat or other chemical methods. Vaccines created through reverse genetics methods are known as attenuated vaccines, named because they contain weakened (attenuated) live viruses. Attenuated vaccines are created by combining genes from a novel or current virus strain with previously attenuated viruses of the same species. Attenuated viruses are created by propagating a live virus under novel conditions, such as a chicken's egg. This produces a viral strain that is still live, but not pathogenic to humans, as these viruses are rendered defective in that they cannot replicate their genome enough to propagate and sufficiently infect a host. However, the viral genes are still expressed in the host's cell through a single replication cycle, allowing for the development of an immunity. = Influenza vaccine = A common way to create a vaccine using reverse genetic techniques is to utilize plasmids to synthesize attenuated viruses. This technique is most commonly used in the yearly production of influenza vaccines, where an eight plasmid system can rapidly produce an effective vaccine. The entire genome of the influenza A virus consists of eight RNA. segments, so the combination of six attenuated viral cDNA plasmids with two wild-type plasmids allow for an attenuated vaccine strain to be constructed. For the development of influenza vaccines, the fourth and sixth RNA segments, encoding for the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins respectively, are taken from the circulating virus, while the other six segments are derived from a previously attenuated master strain. The HA and NA proteins exhibit high antigen variety, and therefore are taken from the current strain for which the vaccine is being produced to create a well matching vaccine. cDNA sequences of viral RNA are synthesized from attenuated master strains by using RT-PCR. This cDNA can then be inserted between an RNA polymerase I (Pol I) promoter and terminator sequence. The cDNA and pol I sequence is then, in turn, surrounded by an RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter and a polyadenylation site. This entire sequence is then inserted into a plasmid. Six plasmids derived from attenuated master strain cDNA are cotransfected into a target cell, often a chicken egg, alongside two plasmids of the currently circulating wild-type influenza strain. Inside the target cell, the two \\"stacked\\" Pol I and Pol II enzymes transcribe the viral cDNA to synthesize both negative-sense viral RNA and positive-sense mRNA, effectively creating an attenuated virus. The result is a defective vaccine strain that is similar to the current virus strain, allowing a host to build immunity. This synthesized vaccine strain can then be used as a seed virus to create further vaccines. = Advantages and disadvantages = Vaccines engineered from reverse genetics carry several advantages over traditional vaccine designs. Most notably is speed of production. Due to the high antigenic variation in the HA and NA glycoproteins, a reverse-genetic approach allows for the necessary genotype (i.e. one containing HA and NA proteins taken from currently circulating virus strains) to be formulated rapidly. Additionally, since the final product of a reverse genetics attenuated vaccine production is a live virus, a higher immunogenicity is exhibited than in traditional inactivated vaccines, which must be killed using chemical procedures before being transferred as a vaccine. However, due to the live nature of attenuated viruses, complications may arise in immunodeficient patients. There is also the possibility that a mutation in the virus could result the vaccine to turning back into a live unattenuated virus.

It is the oldest discipline in the field of genetics, going back to the experiments on Mendelian inheritance by Gregor Mendel who made it possible to identify the basic mechanisms of heredity. Subsequently, these mechanisms have been studied and explained at the molecular level. Classical genetics consists of the techniques and methodologies of genetics that were in use before the advent of molecular biology. A key discovery of classical genetics in eukaryotes was genetic linkage. The observation that some genes do not segregate independently at meiosis broke the laws of Mendelian inheritance, and provided science with a way to map characteristics to a location on the chromosomes. Linkage maps are still used today, especially in breeding for plant improvement. After the discovery of the genetic code and such tools of cloning as restriction enzymes, the avenues of investigation open to geneticists were greatly broadened. Some classical genetic ideas have been supplanted with the mechanistic understanding brought by molecular discoveries, but many remain intact and in use. Classical genetics is often contrasted with reverse genetics, and aspects of molecular biology are sometimes referred to as molecular genetics. Basic definitions At the base of classical genetics is the concept of a gene, the hereditary factor tied to a particular simple feature (or character). The set of genes for one or more characters possessed by an individual is the genotype. A diploid individual often has two alleles for the determination of a character.  Overview  Classical genetics is the part of genetics that is solely about the method in which genetic traits are transmitted via the acts of reproduction. Genetics is, generally, the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity. The process by which characteristics are passed down from parents to their offspring is called heredity. In the sense of classical genetics, variation is known as the lack of resemblance in related individuals and can be categorized as discontinuous or continuous. Genes are a fundamental part of DNA that is aligned linearly on a eukaryotic chromosome. Chemical information that is transported and encoded by each gene is referred to as a trait. Many organisms possess two genes for each individual trait that is present within that particular individual. These paired genes that control the same trait is classified as an allele. In an individual, the allelic genes that are expressed can be either homozygous, meaning the same, or heterozygous, meaning different. Many pairs of alleles have differing effects that are portrayed in an offspring's phenotype and genotype. The phenotype is a general term that defines an individual's visible, physical traits. The genotype of an offspring is known as its genetic makeup. The alleles of genes can either be dominant or recessive. A dominant allele needs only one copy to be expressed while a recessive allele needs two copies (homozygous) in a diploid organism to be expressed. Dominant and recessive alleles help to determine the offspring's genotypes, and therefore phenotypes.  History  Classical genetics is often referred to as the oldest form of genetics, and began with Gregor Mendel's experiments that formulated and defined a fundamental biological concept known as Mendelian inheritance. Mendelian inheritance is the process in which genes and traits are passed from a set of parents to their offspring. These inherited traits are passed down mechanistically with one gene from one parent and the second gene from another parent in sexually reproducing organisms. This creates the pair of genes in diploid organisms. Gregor Mendel started his experimentation and study of inheritance with phenotypes of garden peas and continued the experiments with plants. He focused on the patterns of the traits that were being passed down from one generation to the next generation. This was assessed by test-crossing two peas of different colors and observing the resulting phenotypes. After determining how the traits were likely inherited, he began to expand the amount of traits observed and tested and eventually expanded his experimentation by increasing the number of different organisms he tested. About 150 years ago, Gregor Mendel published his first experiments with the test crossing of Pisum peas. Seven different phenotypic characteristics were studied and tested in the peas, including seed color, flower color and seed shape. Mendel took peas that had differing phenotypic characteristics and test-crossed them to assess how the parental plants passed the traits down to their offspring. He started by crossing a round, yellow and round, green pea and observed the resulting phenotypes. The results of this experiment allowed him to see which of these two traits was dominant and which was recessive based upon the number of offspring with each phenotype. Mendel then chose to further his experiments by crossing a pea plant homozygous dominant for round and yellow phenotypes with a pea plant that was homozygous recessive for wrinkled and green. The plants that were originally crossed are known as the parental generation, or P generation, and the offspring resulting from the parental cross is known as the first filial, or F1, generation. The plants of the F1 generation resulting from this hybrid cross were all heterozygous round and yellow seeds.

She was severely injured in the tsunami and nearly died. She was portrayed in the 2012 film The Impossible by Naomi Watts (with the name changed to Bennett), who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. The family's nationality was unspecified in the film. Bel√≥n now travels around the world as an advocate for survivors of the tsunami and gives motivational speeches about how she overcame the turmoil and two years of recovery following her injuries. She studied to be a physician and also previously worked as a professor of management with the ESADE Business School, and as a business consultant for companies like Pepsi. She has stated that some of her family is from the Canary Islands. Maria Belon bio accessed 3/21/2015 She was the Spotlight Guest Speaker at the Share Iuvare Business Convention in 2015.

On December 26, 2004, Bel√≥n was at the poolside while her husband and three sons, Lucas, 10, Tom√°s, 8, and Sim√≥n, 5, were splashing in the pool, before the family was swept apart by the tsunami. After the wave hit and swept her away from her family, she was able to grab hold of a tree with the aim of waiting for the tsunami to subside. While hanging on, however, she noticed her son Lucas in the distance being dragged by the current, screaming for help. She swam after him, but a second large wave occurred and she was dragged through a lot of rubble and hard sharp objects, and was critically wounded. After the tsunami calmed down, Bel√≥n was able to swim to land with Lucas, only to notice her many injuries. Her right leg was the most damaged, having been completely ripped open, but she was able to dress her leg wound with palm tree leaves. Bel√≥n and Lucas continued walking and looking for safety, but she was losing too much blood and her son had to help her walk. Lucas found a tree that the two could climb so that they would be safe from further waves. Mar√≠a was in too much pain to climb up the tree alone so Lucas, who had already climbed up, jumped down and helped her climb up the tree. After waiting on the tree for some time, the two were saved by locals from a nearby village who were coming to check the wreckage. Bel√≥n was then taken to a hospital, accompanied by her son. During his mother's recovery, Lucas was able to reunite with his father and two brothers, who happened to be in the hospital as well. Once she was stable enough to be moved, Bel√≥n and her family were transferred to a hospital in Singapore, where she received more treatment and was finally able to return home. Aftermath Bel√≥n is credited in the cast of the 2012 film The Impossible for providing her story and working on the set in Thailand in the same locations as the original tsunami.

The mobile structure endeavors to develop formats that work on a variety of platforms, similar to open source software that can run on any hardware. The Chalet Society reacts to the boldest artistic settings and acts itself as a community of artists, collectors, researchers, and other enthusiasts, searching for ‚Äúpoetic consciousness,‚Äù an idea attributed to Saul Wahl Katzenellenbogen - crowned King of Poland in 1587. He only reigned for one night but had enough time to pronounce a number of predictions and appeal for the dawn of ‚Äúpoetic consciousness.‚Äù Launched in October 2012 in a pop-up site ‚Äì a disused school in the heart of Paris ‚Äì the Chalet Society presented a variety of extraordinary self-taught or unknown artists in collaboration with the Museum of Everything.http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/2290/The_Chalet_Society After having tested the limits of the commonly accepted notion of artist, the Chalet Society created the ‚ÄúTester‚Äôs Salon‚Äù in the summer of 2013, a project by the art critic Christophe Kihm and the artists Arnaud and Bertrand Dezoteux.

Though praised for the purity of its classical form, the work attracted the suspicion of the Jesuits, who discovered in it a latent Protestantism, and was criticized by Richard Simon, a former Oratorian, on text-critical grounds. For over three centuries it has been among the most popular of French Bible translations.  History  Several Solitaires of Port-Royal, an early Jansenist monastery, had met to consider the viability of a New Testament translation from 1657 to 1660. One of them, Antoine Le Maistre, began the task of translation in 1657, and his brother, Louis-Isaac Lemaistre de Sacy, continued the work after the former's death in 1658. The Nouveau Testament de Mons (or Version de Mons), their translation of the New Testament, was published in 1667 by Daniel Elzevier. The Old Testament appeared in several parts between 1672 and 1696. In 1688, Antoine Arnauld published a defence of the translation project against charges of latent Protestantism, the D√©fense des versions de langue vulgaire de l'√âcriture Sainte, in which he argued that, just as the Vulgate had been a translation of the Scriptures into the vernacular of the day, so a translation into French, which had undergone significant reforms at the end of the sixteenth century, was necessary to ensure the intelligibility of the Bible to the common man. The translation was a \\"masterpiece of French literary classicism\\", but was censured by Jacques- B√©nigne Bossuet for its \\"politeness\\". The Jansenist Martin de Barcos objected that the translators had demystified the Scriptures. Richard Simon, a textual critic and former Oratorian, complained that the work was more interpretative paraphrase than translation, and noted with disapproval the use of the Vulgate, \\"avec les diff√©rences du Grec\\" (with corrections from the original Greek), as the basis of the Nouveau Testament. Nonetheless, the translation was an immediate success. The philosopher Blaise Pascal, who had seen an early draft of the translation, quoted from the Nouveau Testament in his Pens√©es.

Plot The series revolves around Han Dan-bi (Lee Da-hee), a rude woman who was raised in a wealthy family. Her life becomes difficult after her father, a once-popular singer, meets with an accident that was planned by his wife. Dan-bi then finds out that she was adopted. Her stepmother takes advantage of her husband's comatose state to kick Dan-bi out of their house, all in a plot to sell his land to the ruthless chairman of a hospital company. This revelation leads Dan-bi to begin searching for her birth mother by using her adoptive father's will as leverage, not knowing that the truth about what happened to her birth father is directly tied to the chairman. She encounters several people along the way: the chairman's grandson who falls for Dan-bi but is uncertain of the outcome if they became a couple; a divorced lawyer whom Danbi loves, but whose father is also connected to her birth father, which is the reason why the lawyer's mother disapproves of Dan-bi for her son; the lawyer's ex-wife, and their daughter who likes Dan-bi more than her own mother; a step-sister who sees Dan-bi as a roadblock to climbing the corporate ladder; and an ailing doctor who was not only the love of Dan-bi's adoptive father's life, but knows the real truth about Dan-bi's parentage.

They primarily operated on the South Coast Daylight Express until withdrawn in 1993. History During the 1950s the New South Wales Government Railways ordered rolling stock for the Brisbane Limited, including some stainless steel double deck sleeping carriages. Due to financial constraints only ten conventional sleeping carriages were built. To use the excess materials that had been stockpiled, Commonwealth Engineering constructed five cars, four self-propelled Budd Rail Diesel Cars., and a matching non-powered trailer car. While following Budd RDC layouts, these cars were smaller than standard, being only 77 feet in length and narrower in width to fit the NSW loading gauge. There is a myth that the builders had to take considerable care during the design phase to ensure the structural integrity of the cars due to the large opening required for the roof mounted radiators. In fact the roof structure is continuous beneath the radiator blister the only openings being for electrical conduits and tubing, these openings being too small to affect structural integrity.physical examination of cars by Dennis Toohey during conversion late 1980s Construction Commonwealth Engineering built four power cars and a fifth unit as a trailer car. The four power cars (FPB 1101/1102 and PHB 1141/1142) were each powered by the standard Budd Rail Diesel Car equipment of two 300 hp 6-cylinder Detroit Diesel 6/110 engines coupled to Allison RC3 transmissions. BRB 1181 was the only Budd Rail Diesel Car in the world built as an unpowered trailer. This vehicle was fitted with a 6-cylinder Leyland O.350 diesel to power the air-conditioning, buffet and lighting. This was later replaced with a Leyland O.400 diesel. BRB 1181 was easily distinguished from the other cars by having a smaller roof dome. The FPB class were all passenger vehicles, seating 72 economy class in two compartments. The PHB class featured a 2-ton capacity luggage compartment at one end and seating for 60 economy class passengers in two compartments. The trailer car had a buffet providing light refreshments located at one end and seating for 50 first class passengers. Service history The first two cars entered service in 1961 on the Goulburn Day Train with a U set trailer, before all entered service in March 1961 on the train they were built for, the South Coast Daylight Express. The set generally operated with four carriages. In October 1969, FPB 1101 and FPB 1102 operated test runs to Albury and Narrandera as part of the introduction of the 1200 railcars to the Riverina Express. Following problems with these carriages, the 1100 class operated the Riverina Express a number of times in 1972. By the late 1970s they were becoming unreliable due to ageing mechanical equipment. From September 1982 they began to be locomotive hauled to improve service reliability. Following a derailment at Erskinville in February 1983 they were withdrawn pending conversion to locomotive hauled stock. However FPB 1102 and PHB 1141 were reinstated to operational status and sent to operate services connecting with the Riverina XPT between Junee and Griffith. The remaining three were pooled with the 1200 Class railcars and worked as locomotive hauled cars to operate South Coast services from November 1983. In February 1986, the Griffith service was converted to road transport and the two 1100 class railcars were scheduled for conversion to locomotive hauled stock on the South Coast.\\"Illawarra Loco-Hauled Cars\\" Railway Digest July 1986 page 214 However, PHB 1141 was sent to the Commonwealth Engineering plant at Granville for the fitting of Cummins engines and Voith transmission, but was destroyed by fire during the conversion.

History The roots of FBFI can be traced to the Fundamental Fellowship of Northern Baptists. The Fundamental Fellowship was organized in 1920 as the National Federation of Fundamentalists of the Northern Baptists, during the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy in the Northern Baptist Convention (NBC). While more militant fundamentalists withdrew from the NBC in 1932 to form the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, members of the Fellowship labored within the Convention and sought reform. This continued into the 1940s, when fundamentalists organized the Conservative Baptist Foreign Mission Society in 1943 in protest of liberal policies of NBC's foreign mission society. In 1946 the Fundamentalist Fellowship changed its name to Conservative Baptist Fellowship and was instrumental in organizing the Conservative Baptist Association of America in 1947 and the Conservative Baptist Home Mission Society in 1948. Conflict caused the Fellowship to organize the World Conservative Baptist Mission (now Baptist World Mission), which would only appoint missionaries who were premillennial in eschatology. In 1967, the Conservative Baptist Fellowship broke all ties with the Conservative Baptist Association movement and took the name Fundamental Baptist Fellowship of America. Some of its members formed the New Testament Association of Independent Baptist Churches. Relations were strained, but these two groups reconciled in 1974, though they remain separate organizations. Organization The FBFI is a fellowship of individuals who agree with the Statement of Faith and purposes of the Fellowship. The chief purposes of the Fellowship are to strengthen and promote historic fundamentalism, to defend the faith while exposing and opposing religious compromise, to promote religious liberty and to lead in evangelism and church growth. The FBFI has three main points of emphasis: national and regional meetings, a magazine, and the chaplaincy. Frontline magazine, the journal of the Fellowship, is published six times per year. The FBFI is accredited by the Department of Defense to endorse military and law enforcement chaplains. Each region and the national organization hold annual meetings for preaching and fellowship. Offices are in Taylors, South Carolina.http://www.fbfi.org/ The FBFI is organized into 13 regional fellowships - Alaska Region, Northern California, Southern California, Mid-America, Mid-Atlantic, South, North Central, Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, South Central, Caribbean, and International. In 1995 individual members of the FBFI were related to 402 different independent Baptist churches. 142 of these 402 churches were also aligned with other fundamentalist groups. Maranatha Baptist University, Bob Jones University, and several other colleges are closely related to the FBFI. References *Baptists Around the World, by Albert W.

Web beacons are typically used by third parties to monitor the activity of users at a website for the purpose of web analytics or page tagging. They can also be used for email tracking. When implemented using JavaScript, they may be called JavaScript tags.Negrino, Tom; Smith, Dori. JavaScript para World Wide Web. Pearson Education, 2001. https://napoleon.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ital/article/viewFile/1771/1677 accessed 1 October 2015 Using such beacons, companies and organizations can track the online behavior of web users. At first, the companies doing such tracking were mainly advertisers or web analytics companies; later social media sites also started to use such tracking techniques, for instance through the use of buttons which act as tracking beacons. There is work in progress to standardize an interface that web developers can use to create web beacons.  Overview  A web beacon is any of a number of techniques used to track who is visiting a web page. They can also be used to see if an email was read or forwarded or if a web page was copied to another website. The first web beacons were small digital image files that were embedded in a web page or email. The image could be as small as a single pixel, and could be of the same color as the background, or completely transparent (thus the name ‚Äútracking pixel‚Äù). When a user opens the page or email where such an image was embedded, they might not see the image, but their web browser or email reader would automatically download the image, requiring the user's computer to send a request to the host company's server, where the source image was stored. This request would provide identifying information about the computer, allowing the host to keep track of the user. This basic technique has been developed further so that all sorts of elements can be used as beacons. Currently these can include visible elements such as graphics, banners or buttons, but also non-pictorial HTML elements such as the frame, style, script, input link, embed, object, etc., of an email or web page. The identifying information provided by the user's computer typically includes its IP address, the time the request was made, the type of web browser or email reader that made the request, and the existence of cookies previously sent by the host server. The host server can store all of this information, and associate it with a session identifier or tracking token that uniquely marks the interaction. = Framing = The use of framing added a new level of versatility to web beacons. Framing allows web pages to refer to content such as images or buttons or HTML elements that are located on other servers, rather than hosting this content directly on their own server. When a user sees the email or the web page, the user's email reader or web browser prepares the referred content for display. To do so it has to send a request to the third-party server to ask it to send the referred content. As part of that request, the user's computer then has to supply identifying information to the third-party server. This protocol allows companies to embed beacons in content that they do not directly own or operate, and then use such beacons for tracking purposes. The beacons are embedded in an email or web page as images or buttons or other HTML elements, but they are hosted on a different server than the website where they are embedded, and it is to this third-party server that requests and identifying information is sent. For instance, in the case of an advertisement that is displayed as an image on a web page, the image file would not reside on the page's host server, but on a server belonging to the advertising company. When a user opens the page, the user's computer will request to download the advertisement from the page's server, but will then be referred to the advertiser's server, and will request to download the image from the advertiser's server. This request will require the user's computer to supply identifying information about itself to the advertiser. This means that a third-party site such as an advertiser can gather information about visitors to the main sites, such as a news site or a social media site, even if users are not clicking on the advertisement. Moreover, given that beacons are not just embedded in visible advertisements but can be embedded in completely invisible elements, a third party can gather such information even if the user is completely unaware of the third party's existence. =Use by companies= Once a company can identify a particular user, the company can then track that user's behavior across multiple interactions with different websites or web servers. As an example, consider a company that owns a network of websites. This company could store all of its images on one particular server, but store the other contents of its web pages on a variety of other servers. For instance, each server could be specific to a given website, and could even be located in a different city. But the company could use web beacons to count and recognize individual users who visit different websites. Rather than gathering statistics and managing cookies for each server independently, the company can analyze all this data together, and track the behavior of individual users across all the different websites, assembling a profile of each user as they navigate through these different environments.  Email- tracking  Web beacons embedded in emails have greater privacy implications than beacons embedded in web pages. Through the use of an embedded beacon, the sender of an email - or even a third party - can record the same sort of information as an advertiser on a website, namely the time that the email was read, the IP address of the computer that was used to read the email (or the IP address of the proxy server that the reader went through), the type of software used to read the email, and the existence of any cookies previously sent. In this way, the sender - or a third party - can gather detailed information about when and where each particular recipient reads their email. Every subsequent time the email message is displayed, the same information can also be sent again to the sender or third party. \\"Return-Receipt-To\\" (RRT) email headers can also trigger sending of information and these may be seen as another form of web beacon.See Internet Engineering Task Force memorandum RFC 4021. Web beacons are used by email marketers, spammers and phishers to verify that an email is read. Using this system, they can send similar emails to a large number of addresses and then check which ones are valid. Valid in this case means that the address is actually in use, that the email has made it past spam filters, and that the content of the email is actually viewed. To some extent, this kind of email tracking can be prevented by configuring the email reader software to avoid accessing remote images. Examples of email software able to do this include the Gmail, Yahoo!, Hushmail and SpamCop/Horde webmail clients; Mozilla Thunderbird, Opera, Pegasus Mail, IncrediMail, Apple Mail, later versions of Microsoft Outlook, and KMail mail readers. However, since beacons can be embedded in email as non-pictorial elements, the email need not contain an image or advertisement or anything else related to the identity of the monitoring party. This makes detection of such emails difficult. One way to neutralize such email tracking is to disconnect from the Internet after downloading email but before reading the downloaded messages. (Note that this assumes one is using an email reader that resides on one's own computer and downloads the emails from the email server to one's own computer.) In that case, messages containing beacons will not be able to trigger requests to the beacons' host servers, and the tracking will be prevented. But one would then have to delete any messages suspected of containing beacons, or risk having the beacons activate again once the computer is reconnected to the Internet. The only way to completely avoid email tracking by beacons is to use a text-based email reader (such as Pine or Mutt), or a graphical email reader with purely text-based HTML capabilities (such as Mulberry). These email readers do not interpret HTML or display images, so their users are not subject to tracking by email web beacons. Plain-text email messages cannot contain web beacons because their contents are interpreted as display characters instead of embedded HTML code, so opening such messages does not initiate any communication. Some email readers offer the option to disable all HTML in every message (thus rendering all messages as plain text), and this too will prevent tracking beacons from working. More recently, many email readers and web-based email services have moved towards not loading images when opening a hypertext email that comes from an unknown sender, or that is suspected to be spam email. The user must explicitly choose to load images. But of course beacons can be embedded in non-pictorial elements of a hypertext email. Web beacons can also be filtered out at the server level so that they never reach the end user. MailScanner is an example of gateway software that can neutralize email tracking beacons for all users of a particular server.

Also known as The Task Force, the organization supports action and activism on behalf of LGBTQ people and advances a progressive vision of liberation. Leadership includes executive director Rea Carey and deputy executive director Kierra Johnson. The Task Force organizes the annual Creating Change conference, a skills-building event for community and allies with over 2,000 attendees each year. The Task Force Policy Institute think tank conducts social science research, policy analysis, strategy development, public education, and advocacy. History Founded in 1973 as the National Gay Task Force, the organization became the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in 1985. It adopted its current identity in October 2014. The founders of the National Gay Task Force included Robert L. Livingston and his husband, Tom Ellis; Dr. Howard Junior Brown; Dr. Bruce Voeller; Father Robert Carter, a Roman Catholic priest; Ron Gold; Nathalie Rockhill; Dr. Martin Duberman; and Dr. Frank Kameny. Later board members included Lani Ka'ahumanu, who was the first out bisexual to be invited and to serve on a national gay and lesbian board. The Task Force has acted to promote LGBTQ rights and acceptance. In 2005, the Task Force protested against the Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in view of their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders, prohibiting the ordination of Catholic homosexual seminarians. In 2010, Jaime Grant, then director of the Task Force's Policy Institute, introduced the idea of a bright pink sticker for people to stick on census envelopes which had a form for them to check a box for either \\"lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or straight ally\\", which her group called \\"queering the census\\". Although the sticker was unofficial and the results were not added to the census, she and others' goal was to include the statistic in the 2020 census  Creating Change conference  The annual National Conference on LGBT Equality: Creating Change was first held in 1988, one year after aiding in the organization of the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. The Task Force has added and changed components of the conference over the years. For example, in 2003, the Creating Change conference featured the first ever Skills Academy for Leadership and Action, a daylong session dedicated to skills training for grassroots activists.

According to biblical tradition, Rebecca's father was Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram, also called Aram-Naharaim. Rebecca's brother was Laban the Aramean, and she was the grand daughter of Milcah and Nahor, the brother of Abraham. Rebecca and Isaac were one of the four couples that some believe are buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs, the other three being Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, and Jacob and Leah. Early life Rebecca and Eliezer by Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, 17th century. After the Binding of Isaac, Sarah died. After taking care of her burial, Abraham went about finding a wife for his son Isaac, who was already 37 years old. He commanded his servant (whom the Torah commentators identify as Eliezer of Damascus)Scherman, Rabbi Nosson (1993). The Chumash. Brooklyn, New York: Mesorah Publications, pp. 109‚Äì21. to journey to his birthplace of Aram Naharaim to select a bride from his own family, rather than engage Isaac to a local Canaanite girl. Abraham sent along expensive jewelry, clothing and dainties as gifts to the bride and her family. If the girl had refused to follow him, Abraham stated that Eliezer would be absolved of his responsibility. The servant devised a test in order to find the right wife for Isaac. As he stood at the central well in Abraham's birthplace with his men and ten camels laden with goods, he prayed to God: > And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy > pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will > give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for > thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness > unto my master. :‚Äî Genesis 24:14 To his surprise, a young girl immediately came out and offered to draw water for him to drink, as well as water to fill the troughs for all his camels. Rebecca continued to draw water until all the camels were sated, proving her kind and generous nature and her suitability for entering Abraham's household. The servant immediately gave her a golden nose ring and two golden bracelets (), which Rebecca hurried to show her mother. Seeing the jewelry, Rebecca's brother Laban ran out to greet the guest and bring him inside. The servant recounted the oath he made to Abraham and all the details of his trip to and meeting with Rebecca in fine detail, after which her brother Laban and her father Bethuel agreed that she could return with him. After hosting the party overnight, however, the family tried to keep Rebecca with them longer. The servant insisted that they ask the girl herself, and she agreed to go immediately. Her family sent her off with her nurse, Deborah (according to Rashi), and blessed her, \\"Our sister, may you come to be thousands of myriads, and may your offspring inherit the gate of its foes.\\" Rebecca at the Well by Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini As Rebecca and her entourage approached Abraham's home, they spied Isaac from a distance in the fields of Beer-lahai-roi. The TalmudBerachot 26b. and the Midrash explain that Isaac was praying, as he instituted Mincha, the afternoon prayer. Seeing such a spiritually exalted man, Rebecca immediately dismounted from her camel and asked the accompanying servant who he was. When she heard that this was her future husband, she modestly covered herself with a veil. Isaac brought her into the tent of his deceased mother Sarah, married her, and loved her. According to Rashi, the three miracles that characterized Sarah's tent while she was alive, and that disappeared with her death, reappeared when Rebecca entered the tent. These were: A lamp burned in her tent from Shabbat eve to Shabbat eve, there was a blessing in her dough, and a cloud hovered over her tent (symbolizing the Divine Presence). =Wedding allusions= Some of the events leading up to the marriage of Isaac and Rebecca have been institutionalized in the traditional Jewish wedding ceremony. Before the bride and bridegroom stand under the chuppah, they participate in a special ceremony called badeken (veiling). The bridegroom is led to the bride by two escorts and, seeing her, covers her face with a veil, similar to the way Rebecca covered her face before marrying Isaac. Then the bridegroom (or the father of the bride, or the officiating rabbi) recites the same blessing over the bride that Rebecca's family recited over her, \\"Our sister, may you come to be thousands of myriads, and may your offspring inherit the gate of its foes.\\" Marriage and motherhood Rebecca Meets Isaac by the Way, by James Tissot (c. 1896‚Äì1902) According to the traditional counting cited by Rashi, Isaac was 37 years old at the time of the Binding of Isaac. The reasoning for that age is that Sarah, who gave birth to Isaac when she was 90, died after the binding when she was 127 years old, making Isaac around 37 at that time. Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebecca.Genesis 25:20. Twenty years elapsed before they had children; throughout that time, both Isaac and Rebecca prayed fervently to God for offspring. God eventually answered Isaac's prayers and Rebecca conceived. Rebecca was extremely uncomfortable during her pregnancy and went to inquire of God why she was suffering so. According to the Midrash, whenever she would pass a house of Torah study, Jacob would struggle to come out; whenever she would pass a house of idolatry, Esau would agitate to come out.Genesis Rabbah 63:6. Thinking that she was carrying one baby who was displaying conflicting propensities, Rebecca sought enlightenment at the yeshiva of Shem and Eber. There she received the prophecy that twins were fighting in her womb and would continue to fight all their lives. The prophecy also said that the older would serve the younger; its statement, \\"One people will be stronger than the other\\" has been taken to mean that the two nations will never gain power simultaneously; when one falls, the other will rise, and vice versa.Rashi on Genesis 25:23. According to tradition, Rebecca did not share the prophecy with her husband. When the time came for Rebecca to give birth, the first child to come out emerged red and hairy all over, with his heel grasped by the hand of the second to come out. Onlookers named the first ◊¢◊©◊ï, Esau ('Esav or 'Esaw, meaning either \\"rough\\", \\"sensibly felt\\", \\"handled\\", from , asah, \\"do\\" or \\"make\\";Strong's Concordance 6215, 6213. or \\"completely developed\\", from , assui, since Esau had as much hair as a child who was much older)Rashi on Genesis 50:50. The second was named ◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë, Jacob (Ya'aqob or Ya'aqov, meaning \\"heel-catcher\\", \\"supplanter\\", \\"leg-puller\\", \\"he who follows upon the heels of one\\", from , aqab or aqav, \\"seize by the heel\\", \\"circumvent\\", \\"restrain\\", a wordplay upon , iqqebah or iqqbah, \\"heel\\").Strong's Concordance 3290, 6117. The Bible states that Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.Genesis 25:26. Rebecca, by Giuseppe Molteni (1800‚Äì1867) The Midrash says that as long as they were young, people did not notice much difference between the boys. But when they reached the age of 13, Jacob busied himself in the house of study, while Esau busied himself with idolatry.Genesis Rabbah 63:10. The descriptions of the two young men hint at their opposing spiritual natures: \\"The lads grew up and Esau became one who knows hunting, a man of the field; but Jacob was a wholesome man, abiding in tents\\".Genesis 25:27. The description of Esau as a \\"hunter\\" hints to his skill of trapping his father with his mouth; for example, he would ask Isaac whether tithes should be taken from salt and straw, making his father think he was scrupulous in keeping the mitzvahs.Genesis Rabbah 63:15. Scripture notes that the attitudes of their parents toward the boys differed: \\"Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of hunting, but Rebecca loved Jacob\\".Genesis 25:28. According to the Talmud, immediately after Abraham died, Jacob prepared a lentil stew as a traditional mourner's meal for his father, Isaac.Bava Batra 16b. The Hebrew Bible states that Esau, returning famished from the fields, begged Jacob to give him some of the stew. (Esau referred to the dish as \\"that red, red stuff\\", giving rise to his nickname, ('Edom, meaning \\"Red\\").) Jacob offered to give Esau a bowl of stew in exchange for his birthright (the right to be recognized as firstborn), and Esau agreed. The Talmudic dating indicates both men were 15 years old at the time.This is understood from the plain meaning of the verses. Abraham was one hundred years when Isaac was born (Genesis 46:5). Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born (Genesis 25:26). Abraham died at the age of 175 (Genesis 25:7), making Jacob and Esau fifteen years old at the time of Abraham's death. At a later time, a famine struck the land of Israel and Isaac moved his family, upon God's command, to Gerar, which was ruled by Abimelech, king of the Philistines. Like Abraham before him, who called Sarah his \\"sister\\" rather than his \\"wife\\" so that the Egyptians would not kill him and take his wife, Isaac told the people of Gerar that Rebecca was his sister. She was not molested, but one day Abimelech looked through the window and saw Isaac \\"sporting\\" (a euphemism for sexual play)Genesis Rabbah 64:5. with her. Abimelech called Isaac on his lie, and then warned others not to touch Rebecca. Eventually Isaac parted from Abimelech in peace. At the age of 40 (the same age his father had been when he married), Esau took two Hittite wives, Judith the daughter of Beeri, and Basemath the daughter of Elon, who vexed Isaac and Rebecca to no end, as these women were also idol-worshippers. One reason why Isaac became blind in his old age was due to the smoke of the incense that these women offered to their idols.Rashi on Genesis 52:1, citing Tanhuma 8. The deception of Isaac Isaac became blind in his old age and decided to bestow the blessing of the firstborn upon Esau. According to the Midrash, Isaac had reached the age of 132, five years past the age of his mother, Sarah, had been at her death. According to Genesis, Isaac had reached the age of 137. At this time, the Sages state that one should begin to think he might not exceed the age of whichever parent died first.Scherman, Rabbi Nosson (1993). The Chumash. Brooklyn, New York: Mesorah Publications, p. 135. Isaac therefore sent Esau out to the fields to trap and cook a piece of game for him, so that he could eat it and bless Esau before he died. Rebecca overheard this conversation and realized that Isaac's blessings should go to Jacob, since she was told before the twins' birth that the older son would serve the younger. She therefore ordered Jacob to bring her two goats from the flock, which she cooked in the way Isaac loved, and had him bring them to his father in place of Esau. When Jacob protested that his father would recognize the deception and curse him as soon as he felt him, since Esau was hairy and Jacob smooth-skinned, Rebecca said that the curse would be on her instead. Before she sent Jacob to his father, she dressed him in Esau's garments and laid goatskins on his arms and neck to simulate hairy skin. Thus disguised, Jacob entered his father's room. Surprised to perceive that Esau was back so soon, Isaac asked how it could be that the hunt went so quickly. Jacob responded, \\"Because the your God arranged it for me\\"; Rashi (on ) says Isaac's suspicions were aroused because Esau never used the personal name of God. Isaac demanded that Jacob come close so he could feel him, but the goatskins felt just like Esau's hairy skin. Confused, Isaac exclaimed, \\"The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau!\\" (27:22). Still trying to get at the truth, Isaac asked him point-blank, \\"Are you really my son Esau?\\" and Jacob answered simply, \\"I am\\" (which can be taken as \\"I am me\\", not \\"I am Esau\\"). Isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that Jacob gave him, and then he blessed him with the dew of the heavens, the fatness of the earth, and rulership over many nations as well as his own brother. Jacob had scarcely left the room when Esau returned from the hunt to receive the blessing. The realization that he has been deceived shocks Isaac, yet he acknowledged that Jacob received the blessings as sworn, by adding, \\"Indeed, he will be [or remain] blessed!\\" (52:8). Rashi explains that Isaac smelled the heavenly scent of Gan Eden (Paradise) when Jacob entered his room. As a contrast, Isaac perceived Gehenna opening beneath Esau when the latter entered the room. Showing Isaac that he had been deceived all along by Esau's show of piety.Pirkei d'Rav Kahana, quoted in Scherman, p. 139. Esau was heartbroken by the deception, and begged for his own blessing. Having made Jacob a ruler over his brothers, Isaac could only promise, \\"By thy sword thou shalt live, and shalt serve thy brother; yet it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt cast off his yoke from off thy neck\\" (Gen 27:40). Esau was filled with hatred toward Jacob for taking away both his birthright and his blessing. He vowed to himself to kill Jacob as soon as Isaac died. Here again, Rebecca prophetically perceived his murderous intentions and ordered Jacob to travel to her brother Laban's house in Haran, until Esau's anger subsided. She then convinced Isaac to send Jacob away, by telling him that she despaired of him marrying a local girl from the idol-worshipping families of Canaan (as Esau had done). After Isaac sent Jacob away (to find a wife), Esau realized that his own Canaanite wives were evil in his father's eyes. Esau therefore took Mahalath, a daughter of Isaac's half-brother Ishmael, as another wife. Death and burial Grave of Rebecca in Hebron Jacob lived with Laban for twenty years (Gen. 31:41), marrying Laban's two daughters and two maidservants. He returned to Canaan with his large family, servants, and possessions. As he did, Deborah (Rebecca's nurse) died and was buried at a place that Jacob calls Alon Bachuth (◊ê◊ú◊ï◊ü ◊ë◊õ◊ï◊™), \\"Tree of Weepings\\" (Gen. 35:8). According to the Midrash,Genesis Rabbah 81:5. the plural form of the word \\"weeping\\" indicates a double sorrow, implying that Rebecca also died at this time. Rebecca was buried in the Cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the land of Canaan (Gen 49:31). According to the Talmud, the Torah's explicit dating of the life of Ishmael helps to date various events in Jacob's life and, by implication, the age of Rebecca at her death. Ishmael was born when Abraham was 86 years old (Gen. 16:16) and died at the age of 137 (Gen. 25:17). Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 (Gen. 21:5); at that time Ishmael was 14. Jacob and Esau were born when Isaac was 60 (Gen. 25:26); at that time Ishmael was 74. Right after Jacob receives the blessings and flees to Laban, the Torah states that Esau married \\"Mahalat, the daughter of Ishmael, son of Abraham, sister of Nebaiot\\" (Gen. 28:9), on which Rashi, quoting Megillah 17a, notes that Ishmael died between the engagement and wedding, so the girl's brother gave her away. If Ishmael was 137 at the time of his death, this means that Jacob and Esau were 63 at the time of the blessings. The Talmud adds that Jacob spent 14 years in the yeshiva of Shem and Eber before proceeding to Laban, arriving when he was 77. Rebecca's death after Jacob's 20 years with Laban indicates that Jacob was 97 when his mother died and Rebecca was either 120 or 134 (based on different Midrashim mentioned earlier about her age at marriage).

It is published by Medknow Publications on behalf of the Indian Council of Medical Research. Since 1977, it has been published monthly with six issues per volume. The journal publishes original \\"technical and clinical studies related to health, ethical and social issues\\" in biomedical research as well as narrative and evidence-based review articles. The current editor-in-chief is Anju Sharma (Indian Council of Medical Research), who took up the position in January 2012 after previously having served in associate editor positions. In addition to regular issues, the journal publishes special issues and supplements, with the latter published under a different ISSN. History The journal was first established as a quarterly publication in July 1913, mostly continuing with this publication rate until it was made bimonthly in 1958 and then monthly in 1964. There was, however, a period during 1940 and then between 1943 and 1946 when it was published half-yearly. The number of issues per volume was reduced from 1977, with two volumes of six issues being published each year. In 1989, the journal was split into two parts: Section A dealt with publications on infectious diseases () whilst biomedical research outside that area was published in Section B (). These sections were re-merged from 1994 but with a new ISSN (0971-5916 replaced ), which remains in use today. The journal has been celebrating its centenary of publications between July 2012 and July 2013.

It is the largest ferry company in the Philippines with its main hub located in Pier 4 at the Manila North Harbor. Until 2012, 2GO was known as Negros Navigation. It changed its name following a significant realignment of ferry transportation in the Philippines in which long-standing companies SuperFerry, Cebu Ferries and SuperCat merged into SuperFerry, under the Aboitiz Transport System. SuperFerry was purchased by Negros Navigation, in December 2010, for US$105 million. At the same time, a unit of China-Asean Investment Cooperation Fund, a Netherlands-based, private equity firm wholly owned by the Chinese government, took a controlling stake in Negros Navigation through an equity infusion. Because Negros Navigation was a privately held firm the exact amount invested by the Fund was not disclosed. 2GO has one of the most modern shipping fleets in the Philippines and operates the largest fleet of inter-island vessels in the country, having a total fleet of 27 operating vessels of which 23 are company-owned.

In 2012, the district had an enrollment of 26,980 students, making it the fourth-largest school district by enrollment in Illinois.http://iirc.niu.edu/district.aspx?districtID=04101205025 Per student, the school district spends approximately $11,400 on average. History= Early 19th century = Following its founding as two separate settlements in the 1830s, residents of Rockford, Illinois (joined in 1839 from two separate communities) began to set up a network of schools in the community. From the 1830s to the 1850s, all of the schools in Rockford were private, charging tuition for students. In 1855, Illinois passed a law requiring communities to establish public schools free of tuition. = 1857-1884: Two school districts = In response to the state legislation requiring public schools, the city of Rockford established two separate school districts for each half of the city: District 1, east of the Rock River, and District 2, west of the river. Operated by the city council (in lieu of a formal school board), both school districts featured a graded structure, from first grade through high school. The school systems on both sides of the city proved popular, with overcrowding becoming an issue by the end of the 1860s. Out of necessity, both districts built dedicated elementary schools. = 1884-1900: One school district = In 1884, the city of Rockford consolidated its separate school districts into a single citywide school district; a referendum to create a separate school board lost, keeping the schools under city control. As part of the unification, the two overcrowded schools serving high school grades were replaced by a centrally-located dedicated high school, with Rockford Central High School opening in 1885. During the 1890s, the school district began a campaign of school expansion and updates, replacing several stone school buildings with brick ones. In what has become a long-running tradition, school names were renamed from individual city wards to take on the names of historical Rockford citizens. = 1900-1950 = As Rockford expanded during the first decades of the 20th century, so did the school district, adding several elementary schools. By 1915, Rockford Central High had undergone three additions (in 1900, 1906, 1913), with the school district purchasing an additional building adjacent to the school in 1917. To partially address the overcrowding, the school district constructed two junior high schools in the early 1920s. As a further stopgap, 9th grade students were moved out of Central High School after their construction. By the mid-1930s, the population of Rockford (which had grown seven-fold since 1885) had outgrown its single high school. In addition, the condition of Rockford Central High was considered too deteriorated to house students. In 1938, the school board approved $3 million in funding to build two new high schools to replace Rockford Central, with 45% of the budget funded by Works Progress Administration. Opened in 1940, Rockford East High School and Rockford West High School became the fourth and fifth secondary schools of the district (alongside a second west-side junior also high opened in 1940). = 1950-2000 = During the 1950s, Rockford underwent a significant period of population growth, becoming the second-largest city in Illinois. Coinciding with population growth, the city saw significant expansion away from the river westward and eastward. The creation of entirely new neighborhoods in the city led to construction of several elementary and junior high schools. By the early 1960s, the expansion outward led to the need for two more high schools, Rockford Auburn on the northwest side and Rockford Guilford on the northeast side. Rockford Jefferson on the southeast side was built in 1977 as a fifth high school (replacing a previous high school of the same name opened in 1956 as a junior high). During much of the 1990s, the Rockford school district underwent a period of required school desegregation as part of a class-action lawsuit. Schools With 45 schools in total, Rockford Public Schools has the third-largest number of schools of any district in the state.http://iirc.niu.edu/district.aspx?districtID=04101205025 The district consists of four high schools, six middle schools, and 29 elementary schools.

Geography The Khurda Road‚ÄìVisakhapatnam section traverses the Eastern Coastal Plains, first the southern part of the Odisha plains from the Mahanadi delta to a little beyond Chilka Lake and then the Northern Circars. The coastal plains lie between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal and at places the Eastern Ghats come close to the sea. This area has a number of rivers flowing into the sea ‚Äì Rushikulya, Vamsadhara and Nagavali. =Port development= Visakhapatnam Port at the mouth of the Meghadrigedda was opened in 1933. It was initially developed by Bengal Nagpur Railway. The port has an inner harbour and an outer harbour . Visakhapatnam port handled 68.04 million tonnes of cargo in 2010-11, which was the second highest in India after Kandla. Visakhapatnam port is being upgraded to handle ships up to 200,000 DWT. Gangavaram Port came up in 2008 and is claimed to be deepest port in India, which can handle ships up to 200,000 DWT. A minor port is proposed to be developed at Bheemunipatnam, near the mouth of the Gosthani River. Gopalpur-on-Sea is being developed into a deep sea port capable of handling ships up to 120,000 DWT. History=Howrah-Chennai main line= During the period 1893 to 1896, of railway tracks covering the entire coastal stretch from Cuttack to Vijayawada, was built and opened to traffic by East Coast State Railway.Bengal Nagpur Railway‚Äôs line to Cuttack was opened on 1 January 1899. The southern part of the East Coast State Railway (from Waltair to Vijayawada) was taken over by Madras Railway in 1901. The long northern portion of the East Coast line to Cuttack, including the branch line to Puri, was taken over by Bengal Nagpur Railway in 1902. =Branch lines= The Vizianagaram-Parvatipuram line was opened in 1908-09 and an extension to Salur was built in 1913. The Parvatipuram-Raipur line was completed in 1931. (More information is available in the Jharsuguda-Vizianagaram line.) In 1960, Indian Railway took up three projects: the Kottavalasa-Koraput-Jeypore-Kirandaul line (Dandakaranya Project ), the Titlagarh-Bolangir-Jharsuguda Project and the Rourkela-Kiriburu Project. All the three projects taken together were popularly known as the DBK Project or the Dandakaranya Bolangir Kiriburu Project. The Kottavalasa- Kirandaul line was opened in 1966-67. The Paralakhemedi Light Railway opened the Naupada-Gunupur line between 1900 and 1931. The line was converted to broad gauge in 2011. =Railway reorganization= The Bengal Nagpur Railway was nationalized in 1944. Eastern Railway was formed on 14 April 1952 with the portion of East Indian Railway Company east of Mughalsarai and the Bengal Nagpur Railway. In 1955, South Eastern Railway was carved out of Eastern Railway. It comprised lines mostly operated by BNR earlier. Amongst the new zones started in April 2003 were East Coast Railway and South East Central Railway. Both these railways were carved out of South Eastern Railway. Electrification Howrah-Chennai Mail was the first train in South Eastern Railway to be hauled by a diesel engine (WDM-1) in 1965. The Khurda- Visakhapatnam section was completely electrified by 2002. The Howrah-Chennai route was completely electrified by 2005.

Their history goes back to ancient times. They are mainly located in northwest Tunisia. The majority of this tribe were in the colonial era of Tunisia (1881 ‚Äì 1956) among the national freedom fighters Fellagha, who raised arms against the French occupation in order to defend and liberate their country. The Hajji Ben Abdelmalik El Ouertani became famous because had organized weapons, ammunition and food for all Fellegha.  Diachronic Linguistics  \\"Urti\\" is a word in the Amazigh language which means \\"orchard\\" in English. \\"Wurtan\\" or \\"Ouertan\\" is the plural form of the word with a definite article and means \\"the orchards\\" in the Amazigh language and is at the same time the name of the tribe. The historical evidence is that orchards are abundant in the town of Sra Ouertan south of the town of Kef. The Berber tribe Ouertan had considerable influence in the pre-Islamic era and lived together with the Romans. The word \\"Ouertani\\" is formed from the Amazigh word \\"Ouertan\\" using Arabic grammar to say \\"related to Ouertan\\" or \\"in connection with Ouertan\\". Ouertanis living today in Tunisia speak Arabic with a Tunisian dialect as their mother tongue and are Sunni Muslims.  Geography  They have the Tunisian surname Ouertani, which is widespread in the cities of Kef, Kairouan and Tunis. Some Ouertanis emigrated to France in the 1890s and during the colonial period (1881‚Äì1956). At least 197 individuals with the surname Ouertani have been born in France since 1890. Ouertani is the 49,565th most frequent surname in France. In Germany, there are now estimated to be 24 people with the surname Ouertani. According to Namespedia, the Ouertanis live today in at least 14 countries around the world.  Notable Individuals  There are many famous Ouertanis such as Mohamed Almokkdad Ben Naceur Ben Ammar Ouertani (historian, author), Lassaad Ouertani (football player), Naoufel Ouertani (TV presenter), Dr. Mustapha Ouertani (social scientist), Dr. Rachid Ouertani (physicist, politician) and also Bilel Ouertani who gave up his engineering career to become the world greatest elevator operator.

As a result of his mother's intervention, the school was shut down, Ms. Ford was disfellowshipped from Jehovah's Witnesses, and her brother demoted. In 1953, Gary's maternal grandmother Lysbeth Turner, unimpressed by her daughter's choice of religion, attempted to expand Gary's religious horizons by introducing him to Gerald Gardner, the principal advocate of \\"the old religion\\" of Wicca to which she adhered.

In 1965, the Peterborough Examiner published a full-page editorial on Botting's personal dilemma, \\"Evolution and the Bible: Faith in Science or Faith in God a Choice for Man.\\"Peterborough Examiner, 17 June 1965, p. 5 Botting later admitted that his discussions with Haldane in India in 1961 had had a profound effect on his way of looking at the world, although the process of shaking the social imperatives imposed by his religion took decades.Gary Botting, \\"Preface\\", The Orwellian World, pp. xiv‚Äìxix; Stanley Oziewicz, \\"'It's rather like trying to flee Soviet' to get out of Witnesses, author says\\", Globe and Mail, 21 June 1984 In 1966, Botting's grandmother visited Canada and once again encouraged him to expand his religious horizons to include \\"the old religion\\". This time, she focused her attention on Botting's fianc√©, Heather Harden, nominally also a Jehovah's Witness, who was receptive to the idea of establishing a Wiccan coven in Canada. In 1969-70, Gary and Heather Botting established Coven Celeste in Peterborough, Ontario, having by that time become inactive Jehovah's Witnesses. Disenchanted with organized Christian religion in general and Jehovah's Witnesses in particular, in 1975 Gary and Heather Botting came out of the \\"broom closet\\", publicly declaring their conversion to Wicca and opening the circle of Coven Celeste to any who were interested. That year, Botting wrote a semi-autobiographical poem sequenceRed Deer: RDC Press, 1975 satirizing his experiences as a missionary and the fact that Armageddon had not arrived by October 1975 as Jehovah's Witnesses had predicted.\\"Do Jehovah's Witnesses still hold to their 1984 Doomsday deadline?\\" Christianity Today, 21 September 1984, p. 66 His play Whatever Happened to Saint Joanne?

C8 In 1990, the Bottings moved to Victoria, British Columbia, and took Coven Celeste with them. Its existence in Alberta had already inspired the establishment of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church in British Columbia, and the Bottings were welcomed as third degree elders into both the Canadian and US branches of ATC. In 1993, Botting published Fundamental Freedoms and Jehovah's Witnesses,https://www.questia.com/library/102111748/fundamental-freedoms-and- jehovah-s-witnesses; http://www.garybotting.ca/media/online-books/fundamental- freedoms-and-jehovahs-witnesses/front.pdf an academic work about Jehovah's Witnesses in Canada and their role in pressing for the development of the Canadian Bill of Rights and what eventually became the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.; Despite his advocacy of witchcraft, by 1982 Botting had accepted Darwinian evolution.Jim Isbister, \\"Jehovah's Witness author unnerved by life in 'false religion'\\", The Advocate, Saturday 6 October 1984, p. 1C; Tihemme Gagnon, \\"Introduction\\", Streaking!

Rather than regarding himself as an essentialist like Iris Murdoch or an existentialist like Jean-Paul Sartre, Botting has described himself as an extensionist: all things, including human understanding, can be explained as extensions of mind and body in space and time.Gary Botting, Extensionism, unpublished ms., 2012 Like Richard Dawkins, of whose brand of genetic theory‚Äîand unabashed atheism‚ÄîBotting has been a staunch advocate, he was admittedly influenced by the observations and opinions of J.

This led to many adventures which he chronicled in his serialized Occupational Hazard: The Adventures of a Journalist.The Advocate, serialized weekly column commencing 18 May 1977 Soon journalism became a priority and he became one of the main feature writers for the South China Sunday Post-Herald.Gary Botting, \\"The Descent of 20 Battery\\", South China Sunday Post-Herald, 31 March 1963; Gary Botting, \\"The Death or Glory Boys in Macau\\", South China Sunday Post-Herald, 16 June 1963; Gary Botting, \\"A Corporal at Ten\\", South China Sunday Post-Herald, 16 June 1983; Gary Botting, \\"She's a Bit of Portugal Afloat\\", South China Sunday Post-Herald, 23 June 1963, p. 26 He returned to Canada and in 1964 began to work for the Peterborough Examiner,Gary Botting, \\"Hong Kong: Two Faces of the Orient\\", Peterborough Examiner, 1 February 1964 then owned by Robertson Davies, at the same time attending Trent University, where he was editor of the student newspaper, Trent Trends, and literary magazine, Tridentine.

Laurie Meijer-Drees, writing for The Canadian Historical Review, praised the book for its use of oral history and family history in shedding more light on its subject, but criticized its portrayal of Smallboy as a \\"lone leader\\" with few peers and in particular its failure to put Smallboy in context with major First Nations political movements of the time such as the Indian Association of Alberta. Poet Commencing in the 1960s, Botting published poetry in various literary magazines including Casserole, Hecate's Loom, Issue, Legal Studies Forum, New Thursday, Tridentine‚Äîand Umwelt, a Canadian literary magazine which he later satirized in BumweltS: Poems Written in Sexy '69.St. John's: Memorial University of Newfoundland His third collection of poems, Streaking!

The Collected Poems of Gary Botting (2014), edited by screenwriter Tihemme Gagnon.Houston: Strategic, 2014 Playwright Beginning as playwright in residence with People & Puppets Incorporated in Edmonton, Alberta in the 1970s, Botting wrote some 30 plays, a dozen of which received awards from the governments of both Canada and Alberta as well as private sponsors such as the Edmonton Journal.Drake McHugh, \\"Journal Literary Award Winners: He will produce own play,\\" Edmonton Journal, 4 July 1971, p. D1 He first became active in theatre in the 1960s, when he acted in Academy Theatre and Peterborough Theatre Guild productions in Ontario, Canada. In the late 1960s, he became a theatre and movie critic for the Peterborough Examiner; his essays on and reviews of contemporary Off-Off-Broadway productions were collected in his critique The Theatre of Protest in America.Edmonton: Harden House, 1971 His first play, written in St. John's, Newfoundland in 1969, was The School of Night, later published as the award-winning Harriott!,Edmonton: Harden House, 1972 about the occult club formed in the 1590s by Thomas Harriott, Christopher Marlowe and Sir Walter Raleigh. The School of Night and Who Has Seen the Scroll? were first produced in Ontario in 1969‚Äì70. Prometheus Rebound, written for the Open Theatre in St. John's, Newfoundland in 1969, was first produced by People & Puppets Incorporated in Edmonton, Alberta in 1971. A sequel to the dramatic poems of Aeschylus and Shelley, Botting's version of the myth portrays Prometheus' punishment for granting man access to nuclear energy. Botting studied drama, including dramaturgy, in 1971‚Äì72 as a minor for his Ph.D. in English Literature, and a decade later received the Master of Fine Arts in playwriting from University of Alberta. Several of his plays were produced by the drama department, including his thesis production, Whatever Happened to Saint Joanne?, exposing the tendency of fundamental Christian ministers to exploit promising members of their sects. Edmonton Journal theater critic Keith Ashwell called Saint Joanne an \\"incredibly imaginative play\\": \\"In dramatizing his experiences he has written a very disquieting piece, that becomes positively uncomfortable at the end.\\"Keith Ashwell, \\"Thesis play a bit clever: Whatever Happened to Saint Joanne by Gary Botting,\\" Edmonton Journal, Saturday May 1, 1982, p.

Botting's PhD dissertation was on William Golding,\\"Three Grades of Thought in the Novels of William Golding\\" (doctoral diss., University of Alberta, 1975), published as Thinking As a Hobby: the Novels of William Golding, Red Deer: Red Deer College Press, 1975 author of Lord of the Flies.See Gary Botting, \\"Leadership in Lord of the Flies\\", Gary Botting and M.E.

Leadership: An Anthology (Victoria: Royal Roads University, 1998), pp. 75‚Äì89 From 1972 to 1986 Botting taught English and creative writing at Red Deer College, where he was at various times the college's media relations coordinator, chairman of the English department, editor-in-chief of Red Deer College Press,http://rdc.ab.ca/about/history/1980s and president of the Faculty Association. He was later remembered by college librarian and fellow thespian Paul Boultbee (who had acted in Botting's plays Crux (1983)\\"Nude Woman in Morality Play\\", Lethbridge Herald, Friday 18 February 1983, p.

In 1985, Botting came to national attention when he warned of a threat to academic freedom after James Keegstra was fired from his job and criminally charged with spreading hatred against an identifiable group. Keegstra had been hired as an auto mechanics teacher at Eckville High School in Alberta, but after he took a university history course was deemed qualified to teach Grade 10 history, on which \\"the Holocaust\\" was on the curriculum. Keegstra used his own texts (including the notorious The Hoax of the Twentieth Century) to teach his students that the Holocaust had been exaggerated. Not only was Keegstra fired and then prosecuted, but the RCMP removed copies of the offending texts from libraries, including University of Calgary Library. Botting objected to the move in a widely- recirculated letter to the Calgary Herald.\\"The Trials of Gary Botting: The thin line between the crusading lawyer and his client\\", in Monday Magazine Vol. 19 No. 7 (April 22-28 1993, pp. 1, 6-7 That letter brought Botting to the attention of Keegstra's Victoria lawyer, Doug Christie, who enlisted the \\"outspoken civil libertarian\\" as an expert witness at both the Ernst Zundel trial in Toronto and the Keegstra trial in Red Deer, Alberta. Botting had conducted a survey demonstrating that Keegstra could not get a fair trial in Red Deer because of pretrial publicity. The Alberta Court of Appeal ruled that the judge should have allowed Botting's evidence to be heard, and ordered a new trial. Later, Botting became the first recipient of the George Orwell Free Speech Award. In 1986, he resigned as professor of English at Red Deer College and entered law school. He eventually articled for Christie in Victoria, from where he \\"signed off\\" on Keegstra's appeal factum to the Supreme Court of Canada, and worked on several other of Christie's most notorious cases, at the same time continuing to teach English literature and creative writing at Simon Fraser University. However, once he was called to the bar, he went to great lengths to distance himself from Christie. Lawyer thumbnail Botting entered the University of Calgary Faculty of Law on a Brunet scholarship in 1987. Shortly afterwards he joined the staff of the Institute of Natural Resources Law as a legal researcher. He was elected vice-president of Victims of Law Dilemma (VOLD), an independent watchdog group designed to keep lawyers responsible and to pressure Canadian law societies to appoint lay benchers. As a first-year law student he represented Joel Slater, an American man who became stateless after renouncing US citizenship. When he was in second year, the Law Society of Alberta \\"investigated\\" Botting for representing Howard Pursley, an alleged white supremacist refugee claimant who was eventually flown directly from Calgary to Texas in a form of disguised extradition later known as extraordinary rendition.Tom Keyser, \\"Far-right label proves sticky\\", Calgary Herald, 2 May 1989; Tom Olsen, \\"Pursley won't quit refugee fight\\", The Calgary Sun, Tuesday 25 April 1989, p. 18; \\"White supremacist renews claim for refugee status\\", Globe and Mail, Tuesday, 24 April 1989, p. A12 Botting was cleared of any wrongdoing.Alan Boras, \\"Pursley lawyer cleared\\", Calgary Herald, Thursday 8 June 1989, p. B6 In his third year, Botting was enlisted by Calgary lawyers Don McLeod and Noel O'Brien to assist them with research in connection with the extradition of Charles Ng‚Äîwho faced the death penalty for allegedly murdering as many as 25 men, women and children in California. That year Botting also represented the first dozen Chinese students in Canada to be granted refugee status after they publicly protested China's 1989 clampdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. After graduating in 1990, Botting articled in Victoria for Doug Christie. Botting pioneered the use of video appearances of witnesses in jury trials before Canadian courtrooms were equipped with video machines, in one instance convincing the judge that she and the jury should move from the courthouse to a nearby hotel in Victoria, B.C. to hear the live evidence of a witness in New Brunswick.Gary Botting & Hugh Trenchard, \\"Witness Evidence via Live Video Link in the Canadian Criminal Courtroom\\", (July 1997) 55 The Advocate 523, 524.Victoria Times-Colonist, 7 November 1996, p.

It was directed by Lewis Seiler. It is a remake of the 1935 film Dr. Socrates, which was based on a short story by W. R. Burnett. Plot Married doctors Niles (John Eldredge) and Carole Nelson (Kay Francis) save the life of a shot gangster. Joe Gurney (Humphrey Bogart), the patient's boss, gives Niles $500 as a reward, and suggests he take his \\"million dollar hands\\" uptown, where he can treat the rich. Niles takes his suggestion, but soon neglects his practice for his addiction: betting on the horses. The doctor also starts treating Joe's gang without telling his wife. One night, he is called away to do just that. Suspicious, Carole follows him. When the police raid the gang's hideout, a shootout ensues and Niles is killed while Joe and his gang escape. Though the district attorney (Pierre Watkin) has no case, he charges Carole with being involved anyway just to put on a good show for the public. The trial ends in a hung jury, but her medical license remains at stake. She is given three months to prove it or the license will be revoked. She relocates with her Aunt Josephine (Jessie Busley) to a town, Wayne Center, where two of Joe's men have been jailed, hoping to get in touch with the gangster. While on his way to free his men, Joe has a flat tire. He initially suspects nearby wanderer Bill Stevens (James Stephenson) of having shot at him, but then a nail is extracted from the tire. When Bill mentions that he has written a book about the mistakes that brought about Napoleon's downfall, Joe becomes very interested, as he is a great admirer of the French leader. He offers Bill a ride. Bill makes the mistake of accepting, and soon finds himself shot in the shoulder when Joe and his gang rescue their comrades from the sheriff. Bill is caught. When local Doctor Sanders (Arthur Aylesworth) refuses to treat the alleged criminal, Carole extracts the bullet. However, Bill is unable to provide her any useful information about Joe. When Bill's claims are confirmed, he is released. He goes to thank Carole. Aunt Josephine persuades him to stay with them for a week to recuperate. Joe has Bill kidnapped in the middle of the night so that he can ghostwrite Joe's autobiography. Joe likes Bill's suggestion for the title, Joe Gurney: the Napoleon of Crime, but Bill overhears his plan to kill him after the book is finished. Carole is brought, blindfolded, to remove a bullet from Joe's arm, received during the rescue. Before being released, she is told that Bill will be killed if she alerts the authorities. When Joe's wound gets worse, he sends for her again. He also complains about his eyes. Carole takes a sample to analyze at home. When she is warned that the sheriff and government men are coming to arrest her (a $100 bill Joe gave her was traced to a robbery), she devises a plan. She returns to Joe's hideout and tells him he has a serious infection, one that will make him go blind in six hours unless it is treated immediately with eye drops. She also insists the infection is so contagious she needs to treat all of the gang. Suspicious, Joe makes her administer the medicine to Bill first. Meanwhile, her aunt gives the police Joe's location, but begs them to wait until midnight to give the medication time to temporarily blind the recipients. The plan works. The blind gangsters return fire, but soon give themselves up. Joe tries to track Carole and Bill through the house, but is eventually gunned down by the police. Bill becomes a successful writer, and he and Carole have a son.

Opening in May 2009, the ride is S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies's first and only Free Fly roller coaster. History On 1 July 2008, a patent was filed by Timothy R. Jacobi and Stanley J. Checketts for a \\"Longitudinally Spinning Suspension Roller Coaster\\". This concept was later revealed to be a new model of roller coaster by S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies named the Free Fly. Shortly after the filing of the patent, Parks & Resorts Scandinavia announced their plans to add new roller coasters at three of their parks in 2009. This announcement included Tranan at Skara Sommarland which was the world's first Free Fly roller coaster. After a period of construction from late 2008 through to early 2009, Tranan officially opened to the public on 29 May 2009. Ride experience One of Tranan's trains passing overhead The ride begins with a left turn out of the station. Upon reaching the top of the chain lift hill, the train descends down a small dip into a series of helices and track inversions (one clockwise and one anti-clockwise). For the majority of the ride, the vehicles remain vertical with only slight banking occurring on various turns. Riders therefore do not experience traditional roller coaster inversions. On-ride photos can be purchased following the ride. Ride system Tranan features four trains, each consisting of two, bobsleigh-style vehicles. These vehicles each seat four people inline and are suspended from a central, cantilevered support structure. The two vehicles, which rest on either side of a roller coaster track, feature an air suspension system which allows for smooth, longitudinal rotations. The ride was installed by Ride Entertainment Group. Reception Tranan and the wider Free Fly concept was well received by park guests and the amusement industry alike. In late 2009, the Free Fly concept won the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions Best New Product Award in the Major Theme/Amusement Park Ride/Attraction category as well as the Impact Award. During 2010, S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies was in discussions with several amusement parks about the opening of their own Free Fly rides the following year. However, as of January 2013, no other Free Fly rides have been built. S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies have cited the ride's relatively low operating capacity of 480 to 600 riders per hour as a contributing factor as to why the ride didn't take off. As a potential market replacement, S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies unveiled a new concept in 2012 which features trains seating between 24 and 32 riders. Seats would face both backwards and forwards with the ride experience featuring the same longitudinal rotations performed by the Free Fly.

It was fought in mid-October 691 near present-day Baghdad on the western bank of the river Tigris between the army of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan and the forces of Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr, governor of Iraq for his brother, the Mecca-based rival caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. At the beginning of the battle, most of Mus'ab's troops refused to fight, having secretly switched allegiance to Abd al-Malik, and Mus'ab's main commander, Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar, was killed in action. Mus'ab was slain soon afterward, resulting in the Umayyads' victory and recapture of Iraq, which opened the way for the Umayyad reconquest of the Hejaz (western Arabia) in late 692. Location The battle took place near Dayr al-Jathaliq (Monastery of Catholicos), a Nestorian monastery located in the vicinity of Maskin. The latter was situated west of the Tigris River on the western bank of the former Dujayl Canal, about north of Baghdad and south of the village of Sumayka. The site of ancient Maskin is today known as Khara'ib Maskin (Ruins of Maskin). Dayr al-Jathaliq is likely the site of Tell al-Dayr, a mound located southeast of Sumayka. Background In 683 the Umayyad caliph Yazid I died and was succeeded by his teenage son Mu'awiya II, who died weeks after his accession. With no suitable successors among the descendants of Yazid, Umayyad authority collapsed across the Caliphate amid the leadership vacuum in the Umayyad capital Damascus. In the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina, neither Yazid nor his son had been recognized as legitimate caliphs and after Yazid's death, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, based in Mecca, was recognized instead. Ibn al-Zubayr‚Äôs sovereignty soon extended to most of the Caliphate's provinces and he appointed his brother Mus'ab as governor of Iraq. Meanwhile, the Arab tribes of central and southern Syria, which remained loyal to the Umayyads, in cooperation with the ousted Umayyad governor of Iraq, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, chose Marwan I as caliph. The latter came from a different branch of the Umayyad clan that had been expelled from Medina. Afterward, the reinvigorated Umayyads defeated the pro-Zubayrid Qaysi tribes at the Battle of Marj Rahit near Damascus in 684 and took over Egypt by March 685. Marwan died that year and was succeeded by his son Abd al-Malik, who turned his attention toward Iraq. An Umayyad army led by Ibn Ziyad was dispatched to the province, but was soundly defeated at the Battle of Khazir in August 686 by the forces of a third rival claimant to the caliphate, the pro-Alid nobleman of Kufa, Mukhtar al-Thaqafi. The Umayyad defeat delayed Abd al-Malik's plans to conquer Iraq and he shifted focus to consolidating control of Syria and the Jazira and winning over the Arab tribal nobility in Iraq. Mukhtar was defeated and killed by Mus'ab in 687 after the tribal nobility of Kufa defected to the Zubayrids in Basra. Mukhtar's elimination left the Zubayrids and the Umayyads as the two principal contenders for the caliphate. Mus'ab appointed one of his leading commanders, Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra, governor of Mosul, the Jazira, Armenia and Adharbayjan. As governor over the region wedged between Zubayrid Iraq and Umayyad Syria, Muhallab was responsible for protecting Iraq from an Umayyad invasion. He also attempted to rid his province of Mukhtar's surviving loyalists, known as the Khashabiyya, who remained in control of Nisibis. =First standoff and the Jufriyya revolt= In 689, Abd al-Malik marched toward Iraq and by the summer he encamped at Butnan Habib, a boundary station in Jund Qinnasrin (northern Syria), about east of Aleppo. Mus'ab prepared for his attempted invasion by mobilizing his troops at Bajumayra, a way station near Tikrit. Both places were on the main road connecting Syria and Iraq but were considerably distant from each other. During the standoff, Abd al-Malik reached out to his tribal sympathizers in Basra and promised them financial rewards if they took up his cause against the Zubayrids. He received favorable responses by a number of the tribal nobles, including the head of the Banu Bakr section of the Rabi'a faction, Malik ibn Misma, opening the way for Abd al-Malik to dispatch his kinsman Khalid ibn Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid to enter Basra. In another version of this episode, it was Khalid who originally proposed that Abd al-Malik send him on the mission to Basra. In any case, Khalid ultimately found support from the Bakr under Ibn Misma and the Azd under Ziyad ibn Amr al-Ataki, among others. They faced off with the pro- Zubayrid forces led by Umar ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Ma'mar at a place called al- Jufra in the vicinity of Basra, hence the collective name \\"al-Jufriyya\\" by which Khalid's supporters became known. The clashes lasted between twenty-four and forty days, during which Mus'ab, still encamped at Bajumayra, dispatched 1,000 cavalrymen under Zuhr ibn Qays al-Jufi to reinforce his supporters. Abd al-Malik also sent reinforcements led by Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad ibn Zabyan, a Kufan noble seeking revenge against Mus'ab for the killing of his brother during the suppression of Mukhtar's revolt. They did not arrive quick enough and the pro-Zubayrids gained the battlefield advantage, which led to negotiations for a ceasefire. Khalid was ultimately allowed to leave for Damascus, while Ibn Misma, wounded, fled south into the Yamama (central Arabia). At some point during the fighting in al-Jufra, Abd al-Malik had withdrawn from Butnan Habib to counter an attempted coup in Damascus by his kinsman al-Ashdaq. Mus'ab, upon his return to Basra, severely suppressed the Jufriyya and alienated many Basran nobles in the process. =Second standoff and Umayyad takeover of the Jazira= Map of the medieval Jazira, showing Qarqisiya (Circesium) and Nisibis In the summer of 690, Abd al-Malik and Mus'ab once again encamped at Butnan Habib and Bajumayra, respectively. Mus'ab held his position until the winter when both he and Abd al-Malik withdrew to their headquarters in Basra and Damascus. Abd al-Malik was advised by his Syrian generals to desist from further attempts against what they deemed the unwieldy province of Iraq. The caliph did not heed this counsel and proceeded again toward Iraq in 691. During much of the summer, Abd al-Malik besieged and attacked the pro-Zubayrid Qaysi leader Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi, who was holed up in the Euphrates River fortress of Qarqisiya (Circesium), which was strategically located at the crossroads of Syria and Iraq. Unable to dislodge him, Abd al-Malik entered negotiations with Zufar and his son Hudhayl and offered them generous financial and political concessions. They ultimately reconciled with the Umayyads and Hudhayl and the Qays joined the ranks of their army, though Zufar, out of deference to his previous oath of allegiance to Ibn al-Zubayr, refused to personally participate in the anti-Zubayrid campaign. Afterward, Abd al-Malik marched on Nisibis and gained the surrender of the 2,000-strong Khashabiyya, who joined the Umayyad army after the caliph's amnesty. =Prelude= In September or October 691, Abd al-Malik, at the head of his Syrian army, set up camp at Maskin. Command of the army was held by members of his family; his brother Muhammad led the vanguard, while Yazid I's sons Khalid and Abd Allah respectively commanded the left and right wings. Mus'ab encamped at Bajumayra. He had dug and fortified a deep trench (khandaq) near Maskin to defend his position from the Umayyad army. In a testament to its durability, it was still in existence as late as the mid-9th century when it was called \\"Khirbat (Ruins) of Mus'ab\\" after the Zubayrid governor. At the time of the battle, Mus'ab's most skilled Basran forces were bogged down with Muhallab, who had been reassigned in 689 to the campaign against the Kharijites threatening Basra. As a result, most of Mus'ab's Basran troops did not accompany him, while among those who did were many from the Rabi'a faction who were resentful of his suppression of their kinsmen in the year prior. The bulk of Mus'ab's troops in Bajumayra consisted of the Arab tribesmen of Kufa, many of whom bore grudges against Mus'ab for his executions of Mukhtar's Kufan partisans in 687. While encamped at Maskin, Abd al-Malik took advantage of the internal divisions within Mus'ab's army by reaching out to the tribal leaders in Mus'ab's camp. In his correspondences, he offered many of the tribal leaders control of the Isfahan district of Jibal province or other rewards in return for their defection. One of Mus'ab's loyal commanders, Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar, informed Mus'ab of a letter he had received from Abd al-Malik which he had not opened. Ibn al-Ashtar warned Mus'ab that all of the other commanders had likely received such letters and were concealing the information from him. He advised Mus'ab to execute those commanders, but Mus'ab refused and kept them in their posts. Mus'ab feared that executing the commanders would turn their tribesmen against him. Ibn al- Ashtar counter-proposed that Mus'ab detain and hold the treasonous leaders hostage, releasing them on the condition of victory or executing them if defeated. However, Mus'ab believed this to be too complicated and not a priority amid the pending battle. Battle The armies of Abd al-Malik and Mus'ab met at Dayr al-Jathaliq in the middle of October. Ibn al-Ashtar and his men charged against Muhammad's vanguard, forcing them to withdraw. Abd al- Malik then ordered Abdallah and his right wing to enter the battlefield, where together with Muhammad's troops they closed in on Mus'ab's men. Ibn al-Ashtar was slain, as was the commander of Mus'ab's right wing, Muslim ibn Amr al- Bahili. The latter had succumbed to his wounds, but before dying he managed to obtain from Abd al-Malik a guarantee of safety for his son Qutayba ibn Muslim, who went on to become an important Umayyad general in the early 8th century. Ibn al-Ashtar's death at the beginning of the confrontation sealed Mus'ab's fate. The head of Mus'ab's cavalry, Attab ibn Warqa, who had secretly defected to Abd al-Malik, subsequently deserted the battle with his horsemen. The rest of Musab's commanders refused orders to engage. Wellhausen wrote that Mus'ab \\"was left almost alone on the field of battle, which strange situation itself makes the battle famous\\". Before Ibn al-Ashtar's charge, Abd al-Malik attempted to negotiate with Mus'ab, but the latter refused and \\"decided to die like a brave man\\", according to the historian Henri Lammens. After Mus'ab's other commanders refused to fight, Abd al-Malik offered to spare Mus'ab's life and grant him the governorship of Iraq or any other province of his choice, but again he refused. Instead, he counseled his adolescent son Isa and his men to seek safety in Mecca, but Isa entered the field instead and was killed. Mus'ab then made a charge, but was wounded by an arrow and dislodged from his horse. He was slain by a certain Za'ida ibn Qudama, a soldier from the Banu Thaqif who declared Mus'ab's death to be vengeance for his fellow tribesman Mukhtar. Afterward, Ibn Zabyan decapitated Mus'ab's body. Abd al-Malik mourned Mus'ab and \\"ordered his poets to commemorate his heroic end\\", according to Lammens. Aftermath After the battle, Abd al-Malik entered Kufa and received the allegiance of its tribal nobility. He assigned governors for Iraq and its dependencies. He then headed south for Nukhayla, a suburb of Kufa, from which he dispatched al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf with 2,000 Syrian troops to subdue Ibn al-Zubayr in the Hejaz. With the loss of Iraq, Ibn al-Zubayr had become isolated in his Mecca stronghold. After a series of skirmishes near the city, al-Hajjaj besieged Mecca, capturing it and killing Ibn al-Zubayr in September or October 692. Ibn al-Zubayr's elimination marked the end of the Second Fitna (second Muslim civil war).

It was founded by Irish-born businessman, Charles Moore (ca. 1858 - 30 September 1916). Its best-known assets were the department store known to two generations of Adelaideans as \\"Moore's on the Square\\", Charles Moore's on Hay Street, , Western Australia and Read's in Prahran, Victoria. History=Charles Moore= Charles Moore was born near Derry, County Londonderry in the north of Ireland. He emigrated to Adelaide around 1881 and for a time worked for John Martin & Co. in Rundle Street, then for the wholesalers Matthew Goode & Co. He struck out on his own account by opening a store in 64-74 Gouger Street, later the site of Peoplestores Ltd., on 9 April 1884. In 1905 this store moved to larger premises on the Gouger Street market site. He took over Peter Smith and Co.'s \\"Sandringham House\\" (previously \\"Gault's\\") at 16-18 Rundle Street and reopened it as the \\"Coliseum\\" in 1898, managed by F. C. Catt, who later had his own Rundle Street store. This shop closed in December 1909 after water leaking from the fifth floor percolated through the building, resulting in extensive damage to stock and fittings. This occurred just four years after the store had been enlarged by the addition of another two storeys. It became Donaldson and Andrews (later Donaldson's), then in 1933 Glasson's, which was taken over by Myers in 1938. He opened a branch in the boom town of Kadina (on the corner of Graves and Hallett Streets) in 1887. By 1891 he also had stores in Eudunda and Balaklava in country South Australia. By 1893 a store in Manoora was being advertised, but was dropped by 1895. From 1900 only the Kadina shop was advertised, and that closed by 1981. \\"Moore's on the Square\\" (now Sir Samuel Way Building) Moore was a leading figure in the Central Traders' Association, which represented businesses around Grote and Gouger Streets, bravely making major investments away from the major retail precinct of Rundle, Hindley and Grenfell Streets. In 1914 he opened a new palatial store on the west side of Victoria Square between Grote and Gouger Streets, designed by architects Garlick & Jackman. No expense was spared in providing a maximum of display area behind large plate glass windows, generously lit by a huge leadlight cupola and extensive artificial lighting. A feature was a grand marble staircase leading to the first floor.In the US this would be reckoned the second floor. The store was officially opened by the Mayor of Adelaide, Isaac Isaacs, on 29 August 1916. On 2 March 1948 Moore's was gutted by fire; all that remained was some ground floor structures, the external shell, and the staircase. The shop was rebuilt under the architects Garlick, Jackman and Gooden and business returned until a gradual decline in the 1970s. In 1979 the store was sold to the South Australian Government and was later transformed into a major law courts building containing some 26 courtrooms, library and administration. It was named the \\"Sir Samuel Way Building\\" by the Governor of South Australia Sir Donald Dunstan in 1983 commemorating the South Australian jurist Samuel Way. He opened a store \\"Moore and Gobbett\\" in Hay Street, Perth, Western Australia in 1895, and bought the \\"Coliseum\\" furniture shop, also on Hay Street, but sold it in 1902. By 1899 the shop was advertised as Charles Moore and Co. Moore is particularly remembered in Perth for his advocacy for a children's hospital (founding in 1897 the Children's Hospital Movement) and its generous support. He was principal partner of the \\"Charles M. Read\\" store in Chapel Street, Prahran, and owned the property. and was full owner when his partner Jacob Read died in 1910. In 1956 Read's was Australia's largest suburban store. Around 1900 Charles and his family moved to Melbourne, living at \\"Woorigoleen\\", Clendon Road, Toorak, where he died after a short illness, and was buried at Brighton cemetery. Substantial sums were left to his employees in his will. They owned a nearby property \\"Warrawee\\" on the corner of Grange and Struan Roads, where Mrs. Moore lived for a time, and subdivided for sale in 1918. She purchased \\"Merriwa\\", A. Rutter Clarke's home, noted for its garden of indigenous plants, on Orrong Road, Toorak in September 1917. From around 1930 until her death she lived at \\"Tara\\", also on Orrong Road, the last ten years as an invalid. Family Charles Moore married Jane Cocks Carty (1871 - 19 May 1944). They had four sons and three daughters. Jane Carty was born in Dublin, the daughter of the founder of the Band of Hope in Ireland. Both were interred at Brighton Cemetery. *Charles Carty Moore (ca. May 1895 - ) married then lived at Montalto Avenue, Toorak. He was a noted horseman and huntsman. Their son Fred Moore (born ca.1926) was Managing Director in 1956.

George Ledlie George Hees Ledlie was born at Palatine Bridge, New York and attended private schools and colleges to prepare for Harvard, from where he graduated in 1884. In 1909 he reported to Harvard in a hand-written note that his full name had become George Ledlie ‚Äì thus dropping his middle name Hees, the maiden name of his mother. Ledlie was a St. Louis and New York newspaper executive and an associate of publisher Joseph Pulitzer. George (Hees) Ledlie died on 16 April 1927, and the Harvard George Ledlie Prize became a bequest that year. As a philanthropist, Ledlie donated an amount to Harvard, with the following conditions: \\"Bequest of George Ledlie, 1884, the net income to be paid not oftener than once in every two years as a prize to a person in any way connected with said University, who, in the judgement of said University since the last awarding of the said prize, has by research, discovery or otherwise made the most valuable contribution to science, or in any way for the benefit of mankind, ... and known as the George Ledlie Prize.\\" The amount of this initial bequest was $1,000, and it has varied little with time. The prize is sought not for its monetary value, but for its recognition of the significance of scientific work carried out by the recipient. Thomas Weller, 1954 Nobel Prize winner for his research into polio, said of his Ledlie Award: \\"In 1963 in recognition of my isolation of the CMV and rubella viruses I was greatly pleased by the award by Harvard of the George Ledlie prize, an award given every two years to the Harvard faculty member considered to have made the major contribution to human welfare.\\" Robert Burns Woodward, Morris Loeb Professor of Chemistry, as the University's \\"leading contributor to science and the benefit of mankind,\\" was the first person awarded the newly established George Ledlie Prize. It was given based on his research into the synthesis of quinine, and analyses and syntheses of increasingly complicated molecules, including cholesterol, cortisone, lysergic acid (LSD), strychnine, reserpine, and chlorophyll. The Ledlie Prize has been awarded in fields as diverse as chemistry, entomology, sociology, education, physics, and molecular biology. Over the years it has gained prestige as an award, and is prized by members of the Harvard faculty. Upon receipt of her Ledlie Prize, physicist Lene Hau explained her reaction in these terms: ‚ÄúI am very honored to receive the prize. It is really wonderful to receive this kind of recognition from your home institution,‚Äù.

It contains a single species, Yulong mini. It is known from many juvenile specimens that represent some of the smallest known oviraptorids. Discovery and naming Lower jaw of specimen HGM 41HIII-0109 Specimens of Yulong were collected near Qiupa Town in Luanchuan County, Henan Province, from the Qiupa Formation. The exact geological age of the Qiupa Formation is unknown, but it probably dates to the Late Cretaceous based on the presence of oviraptorids (Yulong), dromaeosaurids (Luanchuanraptor), ornithomimids (Qiupalong), alvarezsaurs (Qiupanykus) and other, undescribed, derived dinosaur specimens. Yulong was first described and named by Junchang L√º, Philip J. Currie, Li Xu, Xingliao Zhang, Hanyong Pu and Songhai Jia in 2013 and the type species is Yulong mini. The generic name is derived from Chinese Ë±´ (Y√π), the one- character abbreviation of Henan Province, in reference to the occurrence of the genus, and from Èæô/Èæç l√≥ng meaning \\"dragon\\" - a suffix commonly used to name Chinese dinosaurs like the Greek saurus is in the West. The specific name, mini, refers to the small size of the specimens. Yulong is based on a syntype series of five specimens: HGM 41HIII-0107: an exceptionally well-preserved skeleton with a skull and lower jaws that is housed in the Henan Geological Museum, only lacking the skull and the neck base; HGM 41HIII-0108: a skull lacking the lower jaws; HGM 41HIII-0109: a partial skeleton with skull and lower jaws; HGM 41HIII-0110: a partial skull with lower jaws and some neck vertebrae; and HGM 41HIII-0111: a left ilium. Additional finds have been mentioned in the describing paper. One exceptionally preserved embryo (within an egg) is HGM 41HIII-0301, which came from a nest of 26 eggs. Description Size comparison While oviraptorids were generally one to eight metres in body length, Yulong was described as \\"chicken-sized\\" by its describers. Most of the Yulong individuals had a total body length of a quarter to half a meter, making them some of the smallest known oviraptorids. The describing authors established some diagnostic traits. The front upper corner of the fenestra antorbitalis and the rear upper corner of the bony nostril are positioned at about the same height. The premaxilla shows a distinctive opening below and in front of the nostril. The rear upper process of the premaxilla touches the upper rim of the fenestra antorbitalis but not the front process of the lacrimal; both bones are separated by the nasal bone. The parietal approaches the frontal bone in length. At the fourth and fifth neck vertebrae, the rear edge of the vertebral centrum forms a straight line between the postzygapophyses. The thigh bone is longer than the ilium. According to the authors, the hindlimb proportions of oviraptorids do not essentially change during growth, indicating a more sedentary lifestyle and thus probably herbivory. Classification A phylogenetic analysis performed by the describers found Yulong to be more derived than the gigantic oviraptorid Gigantoraptor erlianensis, and less derived than (as a sister taxon to) the clade formed by the Oviraptorinae and the \\"Ingeniinae\\". However, the describers cautioned that the phylogenetic position of Yulong is still uncertain, because younger specimens tend to display more basal traits than adult specimens that are unknown for Yulong.

Background Initially, Ibn al-Ash'ath managed to drive back al-Hajjaj and even entered Kufa in triumph, leading Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan to discuss terms with the rebels, which were however rejected by the more hardline rebel leaders. Al-Hajjaj and Ibn al-Ash'ath's troops skirmished with each other for several months before the decisive battle at Dayr al-Jamajim in April 701, where a cavalry charge by the Syrians broke the rebel army.

In classical antiquity it was known as the Sibarys (Greek: ) and gave its name to the Ancient Greek city. It is the third-largest river in the region in terms of water discharge and extent of its basin after the Crati and Neto. It is the main left tributary of the Crati. Geography The river is about 50 kilometers long and has a large basin of approximately 950 km. It collects the waters of many springs at the foot of the Pollino massif and the Serra Dolcedorme through the tributaries Esaro, Tiro and Garga. Initially its course is towards the south- east through the plain of Sibari, but changes to an eastern direction after its confluence with the Esaro river. The Esaro is its main tributary which almost triples its discharge. The river then feeds into the Crati just east of Apollinara, a frazione in the comune of Corigliano Calabro. The river is crossed in several places by the A2 motorway from Salerno to Reggio Calabria from the pass of Campotenese (at an elevation of 1000 meters), a frazione of Morano Calabro, to Castrovillari. Near Spezzano Albanese the river is also crossed by the railway line from Cosenza to Sibari. Hydrology Due to its various sources and especially the rich supply of the Esaro, the river is the third river of Calabria in terms of discharge with 14 m/s average annual flow. The importance of its basin area is demonstrated by the presence of three Enel power plants. It is a seasonal river with strong winter runoff and a lower discharge in summer, pouring 5 m/s in the Crati during August. History The Greek geographer Strabo claimed that Greek colonists named the river Sybaris after a spring of the same name at Bura in Achaea. He also alleges that its water made the horses who drank it shy, which is why all herds were kept away from it. In the time of Sybaris the Coscile was not a tributary of the Crati but pursued a direct course to the Gulf of Taranto. It probably followed a course at a short distance to the north of Sybaris.

It lies in Pennsylvania's southwestern corner near the West Virginia border. As of the 2010 census the population was 201. History During the early 1900s, a cooling system was built on the Dunkard Creek by People's Natural Gas Company to facilitate its operations at a compressor station in Brave. This system consisted of pipes which were placed at the creek's bottom, plus two dams built to provide a consistent flow of water supply to and through the cooling system, enabling the compressor station to cool the gas which was processed there. Although the compressor station was closed in 1959, the apparatus from that cooling system was left in place, causing a series of environmental issues. Among the problems, the presence of the system prevented fish from migrating, and was also found to have contributed to a golden algae bloom, which was responsible for a massive fish kill that destroyed most of the aquatic life along a 43-mile stretch of the stream in 2009. In response, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service contacted Ed and Verna Presley, the present-day owners of the land where the lower dam was located, and Anderson Fittings, the owner of the upper dam and brass plant, in 2010 to arrange to demolish both dams. The project, which was made possible with funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, was initially estimated to cost between $77,000 and $150,000.\\"Back to Nature.\\" Washington, Pennsylvania: Observer Reporter, October 28, 2010.

It first flew in 1967 and proved very successful, leading to several developments of which one won seven US Championships and one World Championship between 1975 and 1982. The Extra EA-230 and Extra EA-300 were also Akro developments with over two hundred built. Design and development The Akro was designed as a homebuilt aircraft for pilots who competed in aerobatic competitions. It was the first U.S. aircraft design to be guided by the Aresti Catalog of manoeuvres for such events. The structure absorbs high stresses, +12/-11g. The Akro is a cantilever mid wing monoplane with a wooden, two spar mahogany skinned wing built in one piece, its forward spar passing unbroken through the fuselage and the rear spar in two parts. The plain, statically balanced ailerons have steel spars with spruce ribs and trailing edges ; they are fabric covered and carry ground adjustable trim tabs. The tail unit is a fabric covered steel tube structure, wire braced and with swept, straight tapered surfaces. Like the ailerons, all the rear control surfaces are statically balanced. The rudder has a ground adjustable trim tab. The tailplane is mounted at the top of the fuselage, with variable incidence and a flight controllable trim tab in the elevator. The Akro has a 180 hp (134 kW) Avco Lycoming AIO-360-A1A air-cooled flat-four engine in the nose, driving a two blade metal fixed pitch propeller. Its fuel is stored in a fuselage tank between the single seat cockpit and the engine. The cockpit has a fixed screen and a rearward sliding bubble canopy. In addition, there is a large window in the forward cockpit floor. There is a fixed, conventional undercarriage, with the mainwheels under glass fibre fairings on cantilever sprung steel legs. Hydraulic disc brakes are fitted. The tailwheel is steerable. Two slightly different models were designed specifically for the first two customers. The Model A design, begun in July 1966 was for Margaret Ritchie, the winner of the 1966 U.S. Women's Aerobatic Championship and first flew on 27 July 1967. The Model B had less tapered wings of greater area (6%) and bigger ailerons, though of unchanged span, slightly heavier (8%) and with windows in the fuselage sides below the wings. The B also carried 16% less fuel but had a lubrication system adapted to prolonged inverted flight. It first flew on 9 July 1969. Operational history The Akro and its developments were one of the most successful aerobatic competition aircraft. Amateur builders began from plans of the Model A or B variants. The 180 hp Lycoming remained the most popular engine but Akros with up to 230 hp motors were produced. The Haigh Superstar is one of several Akro developments as are the Extra EA-230 and Extra EA-300 single seat aerobatic machines. Leo Loudenslager's Akro Laser 200 was a particularly successful development with a 200 hp (150 kW) Lycoming IO-360 engine; initially a standard Akro apart from the engine, it later acquired a different wing airfoil, lightened fuselage and revised, lowered canopy with the decking behind it raised. Flying this aircraft he won the U.S. Aerobatics Championship seven times between 1975 and 1982 and won the World Aerobatics Championships in 1980. Several Lasers have been home built by others. Championship winning Akro Laser 200 at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center Variants Stephens Aircraft issued plans for two models: ;Model A: as described ;Model B: Larger area wing and ailerons, reduced tankage, better inverted lubrication system, extra cockpit windows. In the amateur tradition, builders introduced their own variations such as bigger engines. Stand out variants/developments were: ;Haigh Superstar ;Akro Laser Z-200: Multiple US and single World Championship winner, adapted, built and flown by Leo Loudenslager between 1975 and 1982. ;Extra EA-230:Further adaptation of the Akro Laser by Walter Extra of Extra Flugzeugbau in Germany. ;Extra EA-300:Over 200 of the -230 and -300 produced.

They were built to operate the Riverina Express before being transferred to the South Coast Daylight Express. History In 1968, an order was placed with Tulloch Limited for 10 railcars for the Riverina Express with the fleet delivered between October 1970 and May 1972. While awaiting delivery of sufficient cars to operate the service, some were used on Goulburn Day Train and South Coast Daylight Express services in company with the 1100 class railcars. In addition, two vehicles were also constructed for Victorian Railways as their DRC Class. The ten cars were built in two configurations, one with a buffet section and seating for 8 First class and 36 Second Class (numbered PCR 1201-1203) and the other seating 18 First Class, 36 Second Class and a separate luggage compartment (numbered PCH 1221-1227). The objective was to provide two four-car trains, each consisting of one PCR and three PCH along with one spare car of each type. They entered service on the Riverina Express in May 1972. The purpose of forming the trains with individual railcars was to allow it to divide at major stations along the route where cars detached for Cowra, Tumut, Lake Cargelligo and Hillston on selected days, as well as the traditional destinations of Griffith and Albury. On the return journey, the cars amalgamated again to form a single train back to Sydney. The 1200s soon began to suffer equipment failures, particularly with their complex electrical system, especially when amalgamating. Following one car suffering a distorted engine support frame all were withdrawn in January 1973. The damaged car became an office. One set of four was returned to operate the service three days a week with locomotive hauled and later DEB sets operating it on the other days. This remaining cars were withdrawn in October 1975 when a second DEB set was transferred. In May 1974, two cars (PCH 1224 and PCH 1227) were sold to Victorian Railways to complement the two DRC railcars it had purchased new. In 1977 four were converted to operate an exhibition train around New South Wales for the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Three more were pooled with the 1100 class railcars on Illawarra line services while the car with a damaged engine frame became an office. In 1981 it was decided to convert the latter and two of the Jubilee cars into loco hauled cars, the remaining five were similarly treated in 1983. They were placed in service on the Illawarra line between Sydney and Bomaderry.

It is still debated if it lived at the very end of the Lower Cambrian or at the very beginning of the Middle Cambrian. Marocconus notabilis is the only known species in this genus (i.e. the genus is monotypic).  Taxonomy  Marocconus replaces Cephalopyge Geyer, 1988, which is a junior homonym of Cephalopyge Hanel, 1905, a nudibranch. Cephalopyge however, is still widely used for this trilobite, and the new name Marocconus has only been mentioned one time in the scientific literature.

WorldMap is a collaboratively edited, multilingual, free internet mapping electronic media site open to everyone that is housed at the Center for Geographic Analysis at Harvard University and accessible at the WorldMap website makes it possible for those who are not experts in GIS and web mapping to explore, visualize, and share their research materials in a GIS spatial framework, enhancing their ability to conduct academic research, community service projects, and instructional activities. The WorldMap site allows users to add their own map layers and data sets, symbolize them, edit them, add overlays, add multimedia content (images, video, text), control access, and share or publish them. The purposes of WorldMap are simple: to enable one to explore the development of human civilization in all its diversity and complexity in spatial data contexts, to take advantage of the knowledge of others to enhance one's particular interests, and to create a sustainable and scalable platform in which students, scholars, organizations, and ordinary citizens can participate in creating and sharing any work that can be usefully represented spatially. Overview Worldmap is an open-source and open access online platform for visualizing and sharing spatial data. Worldmap was launched in July 2011 by the Center for Geographic Analysis at Harvard University. The site was created following the success of the AfricaMap project here, that launched in beta version in November 2009 to bring together a range of cross-disciplinary materials on Africa, within an online mapping environment. AfricaMap demonstrated that there is a large amount of detailed mapping data on Africa that can be brought together in one place, that web technologies are mature enough to be able to handle a large volume of data (hundreds of gigabytes in this case), and that users can explore these data smoothly on top of high resolution imagery such as Google satellite view. WorldMap, in which AfricaMap is now located, has data that range from detailed street maps, to language and ethnicity groupings, historic and scholarly maps, environment, transportation systems, World Census and other demographic and economic data, political systems, institutions and infrastructure, urban planning, archaeology, cultural sites, crisis areas, and health and disease. AfricaMap also includes data from the Ibrahim Index of African Governance that allows users to display and analyze results along with other data. A searchable gazetteer in AfricaMap includes over 2 million place names readable in a multiplicity of languages. From the outset, collaborations with other institutions interested in the potentials of the AfricaMap (and WorldMap) platform were sought. These encouraged the creation of new data and in some cases, direct links to other sites were employed to display of these data spatially in concert with additional data layers. These collaborations include, among others, the Trans- Atlantic Slave Trade Database at Emory University, the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and social crisis mapping such as Ushahidi. In other cases, such as the ATLA Religion Database and the Human Relations Area Files at Yale University, associated data were first geo-referenced and then uploaded directly to the AfricaMap website. In still other cases available open source data were downloaded and entered into the system, as with a spatialized version of Wikipedia and various environmental and boundary data, or brought in from government and other sources, as in JapanMap which integrates detailed data on the 2005 tsunami among other things. As a result, users creating maps within the WorldMap system now are able to draw on an array of global and local mapping data already brought into the system ‚Äì environmental (rivers, soils, climate, eco-systems), sociological (population density, administrative boundaries), cultural (language, religion, ethnicity), historical (early maps, period mapping, trade routes), transportation systems, and health (U.S. and U.N. global census surveys, among others). Data uploaded to WorldMap by users often are made available by them to other users, encouraging collaborations and cross-disciplinary engagements employing the same resource data. In short, WorldMap grows Wiki-style as new data are added, with the creators of these data retaining editorial control. WorldMap is being used by several organizations. The Institute of Advanced Studies at the United Nations University (the research arm of the U. N.) is addressing the illicit trade of flora and fauna in East Africa. A Newsweek/The Daily Beast project, ‚ÄúGet on the Map! For Women and Girls, is promoting Women in the World. The Virtue Foundation is mapping Global Health Data at the local level in Ghana. A non- profit music support group, ‚ÄúThe Singing Wells,‚Äù in Nairobi, Kenya is helping to preserve and share East African Music. Virtual Kenya also has created an instance of Worldmap on their own site to explore environmental issues. Cornell University‚Äôs College of Human Ecology, under epidemiologist Julia Finkelstein, is developing a new WorldMap instance called GlobalHealthMap, based on the current WorldMap system but also interoperable with it. Technology WorldMap is a federated system with collaborations in place already with an array of other universities and institutions and is based on a geospatial infrastructure platform developed by the Center for Geographic Analysis. The WorldMap platform is built on open source software so that the source code that makes it work can be examined, improved upon, and extended by researchers and developers around the world with new functionality often added rapidly at relatively low cost. WorldMap benefits from using mapping APIs such as Google, OpenStreetMap, Bing, National Geographic, and ESRI for providing general purpose map backdrops, but the system is not dependent on any particular web map API. WorldMap is hosted on Amazon‚Äôs EC2 cloud infrastructure. The WorldMap platform uses an open source software stack that is being improved and extended by geospatial developers in the US and abroad; The World Bank and the U.S. federal government are major contributors to core components of the WorldMap platform, specifically GeoNode and GeoServer. The fact that WorldMap is capable of supporting a large volume of data and a large number of users is due in part to the design of its servers that use caching, but also because its service-oriented-architecture allows data holdings to be distributed across many servers. The system handles a variety of spatial input formats including shapefile, GeoTIFF, web map services (WMS), ESRI REST services, georeferenced YouTube videos and Picasa photos, and GeoRSS feeds. A user can select several local or remote data layers to overlay and control the transparency of overlaid layers, allowing for visual investigations of spatial patterns and relationships between data sets. Images, video and text can also be added by users to their Worldmap projects through linked URLs to sites such as Flickr or uploads to the WorldMap site directly. Users also are encouraged to adopt an appropriate Creative Commons license to define the type of attribution. Among the important recent projects created in World Map is TweetMap, developed in a collaboration between Todd Mostak and the Center for Geographic Analysis. This project supports Twitter storage, query, analysis, display, and download of massive Twitter geo-spatial data sets consisting of billions of features. The underlying platform, called MapD, works by parallelizing processes across commodity GPU cards, achieving speedups over traditional databases by a factor of a million using inexpensive hardware. Among other applications, TweetMap can be used for tracking earthquakes and epidemics such as influenza in real time. History WorldMap has its origins in AfricaMap, a website begun in 2007 by art historian Suzanne Blier with Harvard University Provost funds in Innovative Computing and was developed in 2008 and 2009 by GIS scientists Ben Lewis and Wendy Guan with input from Blier and Sinologist, Peter Bol, the Director of the Center for Geographic Analysis, to make a broad range of materials on Africa available within an online mapping environment.Lewis and Guan 2011 Lewis, who built the first peer-to- peer GIS system, established with Scott Melby the Geonomy Project from which AfricaMap's innovative technical features in part were based. These include a large searchable place name gazetteer overlaid on Google Maps, using tile services to displaying the many layers simultaneously with transparency control and pre-cached tiles. As users with varied interests saw how the initial AfricaMap site handled and displayed data, they sought similar online mapping applications for their own research interests; out of this soon came Boston Research Map (sociology), VermontMap (geology), ParisMap (history) and ChinaMap (history and political science). To meet the needs of these diverse new projects, and to add new capabilities, a decision was made to build a system that other users could use to create their own custom mapping applications and load their own data. By July 2011 the system had been redesigned by Ben Lewis and Matt Bertrand with new enhanced features and re- launched as WorldMap. AfricaMap has its origins in an earlier on-line mapping and media project called The Baobab Project (Baobab: Roots of Creativity in African Material Culture), founded by Blier at Harvard in 1993 with a grant from the Seaver Institute. Baobab, designed by Michael Roy as an interactive website, included an image and ethnographic database based on GIS, along with narrative-form case studies framed around the questions concerning the social roots of creativity (why certain cultures, places, and periods encouraged creativity and innovation in the arts). Multi-media case studies on the now defunct site, described as \\"\\"one of the largest academic studies of African art\\" addressed a variety of themes ranging from Islam and art to architectural planning. Accuracy of content and quality Paper maps and online mapping projects such as Google Earth are carefully and deliberately created by experts, conveying accuracy even if mediated through political agendas and time. Conversely, WorldMap base mapping and projects may lack source data or include factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations. Some of this is encouraged, as for example the inclusion of ethnicity maps that are known to have biases and inaccuracies based in part on the fact that people's identities are complex and constantly shifting, rarely conforming to precisely configured spaces. For this reason WorldMap includes sometimes multiple different renderings of the same kinds of information so that users can pick and chose between them - or create their own. As a consequence of its open structure, WorldMap cannot guarantee the accuracy of its content or source data, although users are encouraged to enter and cite data as accurately as possible. In order to improve the system, WorldMap is developing a crowd- sourced application that will allow users to rank mapping data in the system and to comment on it. At the same time, WorldMap has become part of several book publications by scholars with these projects also part of the larger review process: Jill Lepore on the New York Conspiracy of 1741 as well as Colin Gordon on St. Louis Neighborhoods and Robert Sampson on Chicago neighborhoods.

It was formed by merging two separate organizations of civil engineers: one group working from government sector and the second group working in the private sector. Brief history In the late 1920s, group of civil engineers from the government sector formed the Philippine Society of Civil Engineers (PSCE) which was the first civil engineering organization in the Philippines with Engr. Marcial Kasilag as its first president. In 1937, the Philippine Association of Civil Engineers (PACE) was formed. This time, it was a group of civil engineers in the private sector with Engr. Enrique Sto. Tomas Cortes as its first president. The objectives of both organizations were similar with each other in which both of them wants to: \\"elevate the standards of the profession, encourage research and engineering knowledge and technology, foster fellowship among members, and promote interrelation with other technological and scientific societies\\". The PACE being the most active than the PSCE led to the transfer of many PSCE members to PACE. In 1950, Republic Act No. 544 (also known as the \\"Civil Engineering Law\\") was passed through the efforts of PACE President Alberto Guevarra. In 1972, PACE President Engr. Cesar A. Caliwara, exerted a serious effort in merging the two organization. Leaders of PACE and PSCE negotiated, and talked about the choice of name. Some concerns were raised such as formal accounting and turnover of assets and liabilities, accreditation of bonafide members and election rules for the first officers which were sooner resolved. These gave birth to the Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers Inc. and on December 11, 1973, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a registration certificate to the association. In February 1974, the first election of officers was held and Engr. Cesar Caliwara became its first president. In order to truly unite the civil engineers of the Philippines, provincial chapters were organized. On August 13, 1975, the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) recognized the PICE as the only official organization of civil engineers in the Philippines. Present time On November 5, 2014, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III issued a declaration by virtue of Proclamation No. 904 signed by Executive Secretary Paquito N. Ochoa Jr. and has declared the month of November of every year as Civil Engineering Month to bring to the attention and concsciousness of the Filipino people the importance of the civil engineers in nation building. As of year 2020, PICE has more than 91,368 registered civil engineer-members in 105 chapters and some 21,177 civil engineering student-members in 210 student chapters throughout the country. Legal issues In 2003. The United Architects of the Philippines (UAP) and PICE signed a joint resolution supporting the passage of Architecture and Civil Engineering bills delineating their respective scope of practice and to strengthen their collaborative efforts in common goals. The two professional groups through their leaders stressed the need for the immediate passage of their respective bills, which would benefit their hundreds of thousand members nationwide. In 2004, the Architecture Act was passed and signed into law. But in 2005, a petition for declaratory relief filed on May 3, 2005 by the PICE and Engr. Leo Cleto Gamolo to declare null and void Sections 302.3 and 302.4 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (‚ÄúRevised IRR‚Äù) of Presidential Decree No. 1096 (the ‚ÄúNational Building Code‚Äù). The said provisions require that architectural documents submitted in applications for building permits must be prepared, signed and sealed by architects. PICE claim that the said sections of the Revised IRR, by effectively prohibiting Civil Engineers from also preparing, signing and sealing architectural documents, are contrary to the National Building Code and the Republic Act No. 544 (the ‚ÄúCivil Engineering Law‚Äù), which purportedly gave Civil Engineers the said right.

In June 2012, the MNLA came into conflict with the Islamist groups Ansar Dine and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA), after the Islamists began imposing Sharia in Azawad. By July 17, MOJWA and Ansar Dine had pushed the MNLA out of all the major cities. On September 1, 2012, the town of Douentzain the Mopti Region, until then controlled by the Ganda Iso militia, was taken by the MOJWA, and on November 28, 2012, the MNLA was pushed out of L√©r√©, Timbuktu Region, by Ansar Dine.  Forces committed = French Forces = French Air Force  Initially, the French Air Force deployed two Mirage F1 CR Reconnaissance from the 2/33 Savoie Reconnaissance Squadron and six Mirage 2000D fighter jets, which were already part of the French military Op√©ration √âpervier in Chad. Additionally, the Air Force deployed three KC-135 Stratotanker planes, as well as one C-130 Hercules and one Transall C-160 transport planes from the French airbase in N'Djamena. On 13 January, four Rafale fighter jets of the 1/7 Provence Fighter Squadron flew from the Saint-Dizier Airbase in France to attack targets in the city of Gao. The Rafale planes then proceeded to N'Djamena and would remain based there for the duration of the conflict. By January 16, the French Air Force dispatched two additional KC-135 Stratotanker planes and two Harfang UAVs from the 1/33 Belfort Reconnaissance Squadron to N'Djamena. To transport Army troops to Bamako, the Air Force used the Airbus A310 and A340 of the 3/60 Est√©rel Transport Squadron. On January 23, a detachment of Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air was deployed to the airport in Bamako to provide security for the French Air Force assets stationed there and to execute combat search and rescue missions if necessary. Along with the Fusiliers, the Air Force deployed two Puma helicopters of the 1/67 Pyr√©n√©es Helicopter Squadron in the combat search and rescue role to Bamako. On January 25, the Air Force deployed two additional Rafale fighter jets and two additional KC-135 Stratotanker planes to N'Djamena, bringing the total to six Rafale jets and 5 KC-135's in the theater of operations. Transall C-160 transport planes from the 1/64 B√©arn and 2/64 Anjou squadrons and C-130H Hercules transport planes from the 2/61 Franche Comt√© squadrons were used to ferry materiel to Bamako, while Transall C-160 transport planes from the 3/61 Poitou Transport Squadron flew reinforcements to the airport of Gao.

For its first flight, the aircraft picked up its supplies in France and proceeded to N'Djamena in Chad,where the French military have a logistic support hub. After January 14, 2013, the Dutch began to fly directly into Bamako. Later, the Dutch contribution was increased by an additional KDC-10 tanker/transport plane, four C-130 Hercules transport planes, three CH-47 Chinook transport and Medevac helicopters and one DC-10 passenger plane. * : A Spanish Air Force C-130 Hercules with 50 support personnel was deployed on January 18 to Mali to help with the transport of African-led International Support Mission to Mali personnel. Spain later added a C-295 plane to assist in troop movements in Mali. An additional 30 soldiers were sent on February 13 to protect allied instructors. * : The Swedish government allowed France the use of the Swedish share of the NATO Strategic Airlift Capability. Therefore, one Heavy Airlift Wing C-17 Globemaster III strategic transport plane was dispatched from the P√°pa Air Base in Hungary to France to aid in the transport of materiel and troops to Mali. Also, six Swedish parachute rangers from Fallsk√§rmsj√§garna will assist as instructors for Mali¬¥s armed forces. * : The United Arab Emirates Air Force deployed two C-17 Globemaster III transport planes to aid in the transport of materiel and troops from France to Mali. * : The Royal Air Force deployed two C-17 Globemaster III strategic transport planes of No. 99 Squadron to the French √âvreux Air Base on January 13, 2013.

On January 25, 2013, the UK Ministry of Defence announced the deployment of a Sentinel R1 surveillance aircraft to support French forces. The British government announced on January 28 that British troops will deploy to Mali, but that they would not be involved in combat. According to the BBC, on January 29, 2013, it was understood that 40 British advisers were to operate within Mali, and more in other nations, making a total of 350. There was a debate about whether these advisers should be protected by French forces, or by British troops - the latter would result in a deployment of \\"multiples of dozens\\". * : The US Air Force has established an air bridge between the Istres-Le Tub√© Air Base in the South of France and Malian capital Bamako, using up to five C-17 Globemaster III transport planes to ferry French equipment and troops to Mali. A small contingent of American troops will provide flight support operations at Bamako. On January 26, US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta informed French Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian that the \\"US Africa Command will support the French military by conducting aerial refueling missions as operations in Mali continue\\". Over the course of Operation Serval, up to 5 US KC-135 were deployed to conduct Air Refueling missions with French Mirage and Rafales including an impressive 100 sorties in less than two months. US covert ISR aircraft based in Burkina Faso supported the operation.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.305 ABC News reported that 150 U.S. military personnel set up and carried out an operation involving surveillance drone over Mali from Niamey. Operations A map showing the fullest extent of rebel-held territory (January 2013), before it was re-taken by Malian and French forces. The operation began on January 11, 2013, with French Army Gazelle helicopters armed with 20 mm cannons from the 4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment attacking a rebel column near S√©var√©. French forces suffered one casualty when a Gazelle attack helicopter came under small arms fire and one of the two pilots was hit. The pilot, Lt. Damien Boiteux, later died of his injuries. The other pilot managed to fly the helicopter back to base, but the aircraft was written off as lost due to the damage sustained. By January 12, hundreds of French troops were involved in the military operation in Mali, with special focus in the Battle of Konna. The Malian army claimed that, with their help, it had retaken Konna, which it had lost a few days earlier. French airstrikes appeared to stop the rebel advance to the south which prompted the intervention and destroyed an Ansar Dine command post near Konna. France asked the U.S. to speed up its contribution by sending drones to improve surveillance over the vast area of northern Mali. The Pentagon was reported to have studied the French request. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced that his country would lend logistical support to the operation. ECOWAS troops preparing to deploy to Mali also decided to move up their arrival date to January 14 at the latest. According to Human Rights Watch, 10 civilians were killed when Malian forces fought to recapture Konna. On January 13, French planes bombed rebels' positions in Gao. Air strikes hit a fuel depot and a customs house being used as a headquarters by the Islamist rebels. Dozens of Islamist fighters were killed. A Malian security source put the number of dead fighters at 60. On 15 January, the French defense minister confirmed that the Mali military had still not recaptured Konna from rebel forces, despite earlier claims that they did. On January 15, French special forces entered the strategically important central town of Markala, describing it as \\"secured\\" on January 19. The French and Malian forces launched a major ground offensive into the North of the country for the first time on January 16. Along with French help, Malian forces took back control of Konna on 18 January. On January 21, the Malian military, with the aid of French air support, took possession of Diabaly. The next day, Chadian forces began moving from Niger's capital city, Niamey, to Ouallam, a position some one-hundred kilometers south of the Malian border. On January 25, it was reported that a combined force of French and Malian troops captured the town of Hombori, about 100 miles south of Gao. French forces also bombed Islamist troops and their supply stores around Gao. This resulted in the destruction of two Islamist bases with fuel stocks and weapon dumps. On the morning January 26, French forces captured the airport at Gao and seized the main Wabary bridge over the Niger River into Gao. French special forces were also in action against rebels that had melted into the local population. During the next few hours, the French-Malian forces assaulted the town of Gao, backed by French warplanes and helicopters. The Islamists lost a dozen fighters, while the French suffered no losses or injuries. A Malian army spokesman said on the 27 January that the \\"Malian army and the French control Gao today\\". On the January 27th, French forces captured Timbuktu without resistance after Islamist fighters fled the city to avoid French airstrikes. In capturing Timbuktu, documents left by AQIM were found revealing the strategic organization of the group. After gaining the airport on January 27, the next day, Malian and French military sources claimed that the entire area between Gao and Timbuktu was under government control and access to the city was available.French-led troops in Mali control access to Timbuktu Times of India.

Retrieved 28 January 2013 Three days after capturing Timbuktu, French and Malian forces entered the town of Kidal on January 30, approximately 200 kilometers from the Algerian border. The town and its airport were taken without resistance from Islamic militants. It was the last major town to be held by the militants. Despite the capture of all major towns, French and Malian forces clashed with Islamists outside Gao on February 5. Several French troops suffered light wounds during the skirmish, which involved long-range small arms and rocket fire. On February 8, French and Chadian troops claimed to have occupied the town of Tessalit, near the Algerian border, and seat of one of the last airports still not controlled by the Malian government and its allies. The same day, the first suicide attack in the conflict took place in Gao, resulting in one Malian soldier injured and the death of the attacker. On February 10, the Islamists made an attack in Gao, which was countered by French and Malian troops securing the nearby area of Bourem on February 17. Two French Air Force Rafale fighter jets operating over Mali. On February 19, a French soldier (member of the French Foreign Legion) was killed during heavy fighting in the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains in the far North East of Mali near the Algerian border. On March 3, a French paratrooper was killed in the same area and the Chadian army announced the killing of the two Islamic Algerian leaders, Abdelhamid Abou Zeid and Mokhtar Belmokhtar. This was not confirmed by the French army. On March 5, the death of Abou Zeid was confirmed by a member of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). On March 6, a French Army sergeant from the 68th African artillery regiment was killed during an operation in eastern Mali around 100 km (60 miles) from the town of Gao, the former stronghold of the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA). On March 17, a corporal from the 1st Marine Infantry Regiment was killed when his vehicle was hit by an Improvised explosive device in the south of Tessalit in the Adrar des Ifoghas massif. Three other soldiers were wounded by the explosion. On March 30, the city of Timbuktu was attacked when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a Malian army checkpoint, allowing a group of rebels to infiltrate by night. A contingent of around fifty French soldiers supported by French fighter jets were then sent to reinforce the Malian army who could not repel the rebel attack. By April 1, rebel presence in the city was cleared. On April 12, two suicide bombers detonated their belts, blowing themselves up near a group of Chadian soldiers, in a busy market in Kidal. At least three soldiers were killed in the explosion and a dozen of civilians were wounded. On May 11, 2013, the command of ground operations of in Mali passed from the 3e Brigade M√©canis√©e to the 6e Brigade L√©g√®re Blind√©e. On May 25, 2013, French forces began their first stage of withdrawal when a convoy of lorries left Bamako for Ivory Coast, carrying equipment and vehicles no longer needed. On July 30, a French soldier was killed in a vehicle accident and a second soldier suffered injuries. This marked the ninth death among French soldiers killed in support of operations in Mali. The second in command of AQIM, Hacene Ould Khalill, was killed during a raid by French special forces near Tessalit in November 2013. On January 25th 2014, a source within the Malian Security Forces reported that a French military operation in the Tombouctou Region of northern Mali resulted in the deaths of 11 Islamist fighters. = Battle of Dayet in Maharat = On the evening of April 16, 2014, the French army destroyed two pickup trucks containing jihadists north of Timbuktu. They then used air and ground forces to intercept other vehicles. During the night of April 16 to the 17th, the French special forces, backed by troops from Operation Serval and helicopters come in contact with the Islamist fighters. The French began by firing warning shots, but the jihadists refused to surrender and opened fire. Faced with the advance of the French military, they abandoned their vehicles and ran, suffering more losses. According to the French Ministry of Defense \\"part of the terrorist group\\" is \\"neutralized. According to the staff of the armies, a dozen fighters are neutralized, that is to say killed.Minist√®re de la D√©fense : Mali : lib√©ration de cinq otages maliens Reuters : Lib√©ration de cinq humanitaires pris en otage au Mali A number of hostages were abandoned by their jihadist captors at the beginning of the fight. The former hostages were then exfiltrated by the French military. Those released were Malians and four Tuaregs. On the evening of April 17th, in a joint statement, the French president and the president of Mali, announced the release of five hostages. The ICRC also published a statement in which he welcomed the release and said that two humanitarian workers had suffered minor injuries but their life was not in danger.  Reactions  In the wake of the French deployment, ECOWAS said that it had ordered its African-led International Support Mission to Mali to be deployed immediately, and the European Union said it had increased preparations for sending a military training mission, EUTM Mali. UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon hoped on January 12th that the French government's decision would \\"be consistent with the spirit\\" of UN Security Council resolution 2085 adopted in December. Algerian foreign ministry spokesman Amar Belani expressed support for the Malian transitional authorities, and \\"noted that Mali has asked, in line with its sovereignty, for friendly powers to reinforce its national capacities to fight terrorism\\". Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Secretary General of NATO (2009-2014), said that he did not see a role for the NATO in Mali (NATO can't be the world's policeman, travelling from country to country, solving all the problems. So I think it's a good idea to have a division of labour. [..] the United Nation Security Council has mandated an African-led stabilisation force to take action in Mali).Interview: Rasmussen: ‚ÄòNo role for NATO in Mali‚Äô Germany could take part in any European training mission to Mali to help its government prepare troops to counter the insurgents, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on January 14. German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle ruled out the possibility of German armed forces taking part in a combat mission in Mali, but he also said Germany was prepared to help train the Mali Armed Forces. On January 14, the Tuareg separatist MNLA declared it would fight alongside the French and even the Malian government to \\"end terrorism in Azawad\\". The spokesman also declared that the MNLA would be a more effective force than those of the neighboring West African nations \\"because of our knowledge of the ground and the populations\\". Mathieu Guid√®re, a scholar of Islam and the Arab world at the University of Toulouse, said in an interview published in the newsmagazine Jeune Afrique, that without the French military intervention the state of Mali would have fallen. France's stated rationale for the operation is that to do otherwise would allow \\"a terrorist state at the doorstep of France and Europe.\\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the intervention in a phone call with French President Fran√ßois Hollande as \\"a brave step against extremist Islamic terrorism\\". Egypt's former President Mohammed Morsi, an Islamist, criticized France's intervention. On January 26, during the CELAC and European Union summit in Santiago de Chile, Colombia and Chile both expressed support for the French military intervention in Mali. Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, stated that \\"Colombia has suffered so much from terrorism that it can not disagree with this action.\\" A 2013 Al Jazeera poll found that 96% of Malians in Bamako supported French intervention.

He was employed by PERFINI in the 1950s and was a frequent collaborator with director Usmar Ismail. Biography Tera was born on 25 October 1920 in Madiun, East Java, Dutch East Indies. He continued his education until junior high school, later becoming a photographer. Around 1948, during the Indonesian National Revolution, Tera joined the Dutch-owned production company South Pacific Film Corporation, where he studied cinematography under the Dutch cameraman AA Denninghoff-Stelling. With South Pacific, Tera served as assistant cinematographer for several productions, including Djaoeh Dimata (1948), Gadis Desa, Harta Karun, and Tjitra (all 1949). It was while working there Tera met Usmar Ismail, who was the director of Harta Karun and Tjitra. After the end of the revolution in December 1949, Ismail began work on Darah dan Doa (The Long March; 1950). Tera was asked to join the production. Shooting began on 30 March 1950, a date which is now celebrated as National Film Day in Indonesia. After the film was released, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Despite this, Tera remained with Ismail's company Perfini, later training several of its cameramen, including Kosnen, R. Husein, and Kasdullah. In the 1960s Tera began working for films by other companies, with Perfini's permission. In his later years Tera worked freelance, both for money and because he felt he was destined to be a cinematographer. He made his last film, Nuansa Birunya Rinjani, in 1989.
