The groups targeted towns and border posts along the China‚ÄìMyanmar border in Muse Township, Myanmar.  Timeline  On the morning of 20 November 2016, MNDAA and Arakan Army troops attacked the town of Mong Ko at 3:00 am (MMT), KIA troops attacked the town of Pang Sai at 6:00 am, and two battalions of the TNLA's 5th Brigade attacked border police and army posts in Muse Township at 8:00 am. Eight people were killed in the attack‚Äîone soldier, three policemen and 4 civilians‚Äîwhilst 26 others were wounded. The Myanmar Army responded to the attacks by shelling insurgent bases in Muse Township, and the Myanmar Air Force began launching more airstrikes in the area as well, resulting in several civilian casualties. Local charities and aid groups reported that 2,000 to 3,000 internally displaced civilians fled to nearby monasteries in Muse Township following the clashes. After fighting had ceased in the town of Muse on 23 November 2016, over 800 residents returned under the security of the Myanmar Army and local militias. However, some residents remained fearful and contradicted official reports that the fighting had ended, saying that they could still hear gunfire in the town. The Northern Alliance claimed complete control of Mong Ko on 25 November 2016; however, the Myanmar Army recaptured the town on 4 December 2016, after Northern Alliance troops withdrew to avoid civilian casualties from airstrikes by the Myanmar Air Force.  Aftermath  On 30 November 2016, a reported total of 16 people had died from the conflict, 51 had been wounded, 2,600 had been internally displaced and 3,000 had fled to China. The violence also severely reduced cross-border trade in the area between China and Myanmar, damaging the local economy that formerly saw $10 million USD worth of goods pass the border daily. State Counsellor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi made a statement on 23 November 2016, urging the Northern Alliance to cease hostilities and to sign the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA). A spokesperson for the TNLA later blamed the government for the fighting and for subsequent failed peace arrangements, citing the exclusion of the KIA from individual meetings as a deterrent for the Northern Alliance.

It usually has a single more or less round leaf and a flowering spike with up to fourteen small, green flowers with a greenish brown to pinkish, wedge-shaped labellum. Description Cyrtostylis tenuissima is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single more or less round leaf long and wide. The leaf is green on both surfaces. Between two and fifteen green flowers about long and wide are borne on a flowering stem high. The dorsal sepal is erect and curved forward, long and wide. The lateral sepals are a similar size to the lateral sepals, turn downwards and often cross over each other. The petals are long, about wide and spread apart from each other. The labellum is wedge-shaped with a pointed tip, long, about wide and slopes downwards. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming The dwarf gnat orchid was first formally described in 1933 by William Henry Nicholls and Bede Goadby who gave it the name Acianthus tenuissimus. The description was published in The Victorian Naturalist from a specimen collected near Bayswater. In 1987 David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Cyrtostylis tenuissima. The specific epithet (tenuissima) is the superlative form of the Latin word tenuis meaning \\"thin\\", hence \\"thinnest\\". Distribution and habitat The dwarf gnat orchid grows under shrubs and grasstrees around winter-wet areas between Perth and Albany with disjunct populations near Esperance. Conservation Cyrtostylis tenuissima is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Over the course of the car chase, one suspect fired over 100 rounds from an AK-47s at police disabling 14 police vehicles including a Lenco BearCat and more than 30 officers shot over 600 rounds into the getaway vehicle. Two perpetrators were killed, two hostages were injured, one hostage was killed by police ammunition, and numerous vehicles and other property were damaged or destroyed by the nearly 1,000 rounds of ammunition fired by the robbers and police. Events =Prior to the robbery= Shortly after 2 p.m., Misty Holt-Singh went to a branch of the Bank of the West to use the ATM, accompanied by her 12-year-old daughter, Mia. She went to the branch in the northern part of the city, located at 7810 Thornton Rd. While Mia waited in the car, a dark four door Buick, driven by Pablo Ruvalcaba dropped off Jaime Ramos, Gilbert Renteria, and Alex Martinez. The suspects were believed to be a part of the Norte√±os street gang,. As Misty Holt-Singh turned to leave the ATM, one of the suspects grabbed her and dragged her into the bank. Driver Pablo Ruvalcaba then left the scene in the Buick while the three other individuals entered. This was already an unusual day for this branch of the bank as it was the branch's last day of business before closing for good. =Robbery= Branch manager Kelley Huber immediately recognized the trio from a robbery months earlier. One of the suspects, who had robbed the bank previously, looked at Huber and ordered that she open the vault. The suspect filled a backpack with cash from the vault. Aftermath =Bank of the West= The branch located at 7810 Thornton Rd in Stockton would close. The location is now a Starbucks. =Police force= Stockton Police Chief Eric Jones began immediate transparent dialogue with the officers involved and press covering the story, making it clear that it was in fact SPD bullets that took Holt-Singh's life. In the following days many officers had to fill in for the 33 who discharged their weapons and were put on administrative leave stretching the already thin police force even thinner. Representatives for all three hostage's filled intents to sue the City of Stockton for the actions of the police officers. =Suspects= Gilbert Renteria and Alex Martinez were found deceased at the scene. Investigators had been gathering information and intelligence on both Renteria and Martinez in the years prior to the robbery. The two were part of a known group who were selling methamphetamine in Stockton. A complaint filed in November 2008, names both Renteria and Martinez and other defendants for possession of a controlled substance for sale, possession of marijuana for sale, marijuana cultivation and street terrorism. Stockton police say they are confident Martinez had robbed that same Bank of the West branch on Jan. 31, 2014. Investigators have reviewed surveillance footage from both incidents and spoken to witnesses who provided physical descriptions. In both robberies, someone dropped off the robbers. The men were armed, had similar disguises and left in employee vehicles, police said. Jaime Ramos was taken into custody at the scene and was charged with three counts of murder and 22 counts of attempted murder of police. He used hostage Misty Holt-Singh to shield himself from SPD. In 2016 he pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty and was sentenced to life in prison. Pablo Ruvalcaba (21) was announced as a person of interest and turned himself in on September 16 but was released the same day. On December 22, he was arrested by federal agents without incident in Merced. He was charged with aiding and abetting and in 2016 received a sentence of 25 years to life.

His mother was Jane, daughter of Benjamin Wallace, of Ramelton, County of Donegal; she was Alexander Stewart's second wife. G. Stewart was born in his father's house in 1752. Stewart was twice married; firstly to Frances Anne, daughter of William Stewart, of Killymoon, County of Tyrone, who for some time represented that county in the Irish Parliament; secondly to Elizabeth Mitchell, a Dublin lady. Career Stewart began to practise at 11 Fownes Street, Dublin, in 1773, and in the same year he was elected a surgeon to the Charitable Infirmary, Inns Quay, which subsequently was removed to Jervis Street. Soon after Stewart moved to South George's Street, and at the date of the foundation of the College he resided at 32 Mary Street. He again changed his residence to 74 Stephen Street, and the latter portion of his life was spent in a fine mansion in Upper Merrion Street. Stewart being well connected, having agreeable manners and much surgical skill, soon acquired an extensive practice amongst the upper classes. In 1785 he was appointed state surgeon, and on Richardson's death, in 1787, he succeeded that surgeon in the position of surgeon-general to the forces. Death and legacy He died at his house, 19 Upper Merrion Street, on 8 June 1813. On 21 June 1813, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, on the motion of Abraham Colles, resolved to help to perpetuate his memory by placing a marble bust of him in their principal hall.

Adopted in 1819, the seal incorporates scales, a sword, and a caduceus. The seal is featured prominently in the flag of Cincinnati and the insignia of city agencies and institutions.  Design  The seal's design is defined by city ordinance: 1788 is the year that Mathias Denman, Colonel Robert Patterson, and Israel Ludlow settled present-day Cincinnati. The year is a relatively recent addition; several insignia based on this seal omit the year, including the flag of Cincinnati and the seal of the Mayor of Cincinnati, as seen on mayoral proclamations.For example, see the seal on The motto is a Latin phrase variously translated as \\"unity assists\\", \\"strength in unity\\", \\"together we assist\\", \\"united they aid each other\\", or \\"together they strive\\". It derives from the legal principle, (\\"What is without value on its own, helps when joined\\"). Two of the elements in the seal are associated with Lady Justice: the scales represent justice, while the sword represents authority and power. The caduceus is the traditional symbol of commerce; its serpents represent wisdom.

The 1802 act granting Cincinnati its first town charter included a provision for a corporate seal. The first town seal was adopted in a town council meeting on July 17, 1802. It was made of copper and bore the following design: The sun and agricultural implements were common in seals around the time of Ohio's statehood. After Cincinnati received its second town charter in 1815, the town council readopted the 1802 seal. On April 10, 1815, the town council adopted the recommendation of Oliver M. Spencer, Jacob Burnet, and Joseph Warren, adopting the council's seal as the town's corporate seal, replacing \\"1802\\" with \\"1815\\". On May 19, 1819, shortly after being reincorporated as a city, Cincinnati adopted the current seal with minor differences.As seen in As seen in A flag by Emil Rothengatter that incorporates the seal was adopted as Cincinnati's municipal flag unofficially in 1896 and officially in 1940.

The city seal is used in formal contexts, such as on lecterns. The seal appeared on most city vehicles, signs, and letterheads until 2009, when the city adopted a distinct logo by Cincinnati- based Libby, Perszyk, Kathman. The city continues to use the seal on some official documents. The seal appears above the entrances to several historic public buildings, including City Hall and the old Water Works building. The coat of arms is found on the flag of Cincinnati. It has also been incorporated into the University of Cincinnati's seal and the Cincinnati Police Department's badge, as well as the police department's unofficial flag. The original seal of the Cincinnati Public Library incorporated the municipal seal, surmounted by two hands exchanging a candle.

In January, 1780, he was promoted to be surgeon in the 77th Regiment, which mutinied and was disbanded in 1783 in consequence of the Government deciding to send it to India, contrary to the express conditions under which the regiment was recruited. Immediately after this event Renny settled in Dublin and was later appointed Surgeon and Physician to the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.

Renny also served as Governor of Cork Street Fever Hospital and on a commission of inquiry into the House of Industry hospitals. Renny rendered valuable services to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, as it was mainly through his influence that the Government were persuaded to give liberal grants towards the expense of erecting new buildings in St. Stephen's Green.

His lecturing style was praised for its lucidity and his speech for its diction. Incidents In 1805, according to an account in The Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science in 1859, Richards was asked to advise on a case of a new- born child that showed signs of syphilitic infection and soon after died. The father reported that he had been treated successfully for syphilis with mercury over two years earlier. The attending physician sought Richards's advice as to whether the parents should have a course of mercury before having another child but Richards advised against it on the grounds that such treatment would not eliminate \\"latent syphilis\\". The mother subsequently had a \\"putrid child\\" but Richards continued to advise against mercury on the grounds that the \\"venereal taint\\" would eventually wear itself out and the couple went on to have a number of healthy births as well as some that were premature or unhealthy.\\"Diday on Syphilis in Children\\", The Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science, Volume 28 (Aug. & Nov. 1859), pp. 456‚Äì467 (p. 463).

According to a pseudonymous author writing in Fraser's Magazine, and reprinted in The Eclectic Magazine in 1863, the incident took place in the coffee room of the Irish House of Commons and the patient was Denis Browne.\\"Physicians and Surgeons of a By-Gone Generation\\" by A Man on the Shady Side of Fifty, The Eclectic Magazine, Vol. 58 (1863), p. 79. It was referred to by the author of The Metropolis,2nd edition, 1805. probably the satirist William Norcott, as follows: :\\"Of old, more active, when by merit push'd :Beyond his rivals, to the goal he rush'd. :But not less worthy of the sweepstakes won :He holds the distance, as he first begun. :To Fortune's smiles, that glisten on so few, :Oft times as much as to desert is due; :If Lords and Commons, when a shank of mutton :Stuck in the throttle of some greedy glutton, :Ne'er saw thy dexterous knife the windpipe slit, :And his tight gullet render back the bit; :How long, midst garret-patients had you struggled :E'er your lost skill to drawing-rooms was smuggled.\\" Richards was said to be the \\"fattest surgeon in the United Kingdom\\", requiring him to enter a carriage sideways. He was a good friend of fellow surgeon Ralph Smith O‚Äôbr√© who, by contrast, was known for his small size. According to one story, which may be apocryphal, they were once robbed on the highway while returning from an operation in the country. O'br√© saved himself by hiding behind Richards who had all his money and surgical equipment stolen. In return, Richards gave up O'br√© who was also robbed and Richards negotiated his own belongings back. Wealth In 1812, Richards won ¬£10,000 in a lottery. In that year, he purchased land in the Roebuck Grove area of the Roebuck Estate in County Dublin from the Baron TrimlestownOrigins of the Belfield Campus and UCD‚Äôs Period Houses Map and Guide. University College Dublin, Dublin, 2012. and in 1818 he purchased the Ardamine Estate in County Wexford from Sir Thomas Roberts Bart. He also bought property from Abel Ram of Clonattin. Death and legacy Richards was found dead in bed by his wife on the morning of 6 November 1819. He was survived by his eldest son John Goddard Richards, barrister. His position at the Meath Hospital was taken over by W. H. Porter, who carried on research and wrote papers on tracheotomy.\\"Medical News\\", British Medical Journal, 4 May 1861, p. 483.

Other names include the Florida tortoise beetle and iridescent blue chrysomelid beetle. It is native to the southeastern United States, from North Carolina, south to Florida, and west to Mississippi. It is introduced to southern Texas. The palmetto tortoise beetle was originally described in 1824 by Thomas Say as Imatidium cyaneum. The specific name (cyanea) means \\"dark blue\\". Description The palmetto tortoise beetle is a small beetle growing in length. The coloring of the elytra and pronotum is a dark, metallic blue. The orange antennae are short and enlarged at the tips. Larva of the palmetto tortoise beetle hide under a nest-like covering of thin strands of frass (fecal matter). They pupate inside of these fecal shelters. The adults hold themselves on fronds of palmettos with thousands of microscopic bristles on their tarsi (\\"feet\\"), paired with an oil that makes them difficult to pry off the leaves.

He was the first foreign missionary to be murdered by paramilitary forces during Martial Law, provoking public outcry from the Vatican and Italian government. His death caused international attention to human rights violations and abuses to paramilitary forces during the Marcos dictatorship.  Missions work  Favali was a member of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME), an all-male international group of priests who are dedicated to evangelization in underdeveloped and non-Christian nations. Favali was assigned to do missions work in the Philippines, particularly in provinces in Mindanao. He arrived in the Philippines in 1983, and was ordained as the parish priest of La Esperanza in Tulunan, North Cotabato. He studied the Ilonggo language, which is the language spoken in many places in Mindanao.  Martyrdom  Many parts of North Cotabato were occupied by armed pseudo-religious cults that were hired by the Marcos dictatorship's anti-insurgency campaign. They were commissioned as paramilitary units who operated as Barrio Self-Defense Units, later called Integrated Civilian Home Defense Force or ICHDF. Notorious members of these units were Edilberto, Norberto Jr., and Elpidio Manero who were brothers, known for their killing sprees. Favali was called by townspeople for help after the Manero brothers shot the town's tailor. When the Manero brothers saw him arrive and enter a house, Norberto Jr. dragged his motorcycle and set it on fire. When Favali hurried out after seeing the fire, Edilberto shot the priest pointblank in his head, trampled on his body and fired again. This caused the priest's skull to crack open, and Norberto Jr. picked the brains and displayed them to the horrified witnesses. The brothers, along with a few other gang members, stood by laughing and heckling. The Manero brothers and five others were found guilty of murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment. The court also found Norberto Jr. guilty of arson.  Legacy  Favalli is honored at the Wall of Remembrance at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani (Monument of the Heroes), which is dedicated to memorializing \\" individuals who lived and died in defiance of the repressive regime that ruled over the Philippines from 1972 to 1986\\".

His contributions to research have been acknowledged through the Gossen Prize (2002), a fellowship of the European Economic Association (2004), and a membership of the German Academy of Sciences (2008). Key contributions of his research include the following: * Investments into telecommunication infrastructure between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s likely substantially increased economic growth in the OECD, especially when it led to an infrastructure allowing for near universal service (with Leonard Waverman).R√∂ller, L.H., Waverman, L. (2001). Telecommunications infrastructure and economic development: A simultaneous approach. American Economic Review, 91(4), pp. 909-923. * Whether or not innovation policies are complementary depends on whether the target is to make firms innovative or increase their innovation intensity as well as on the particular pair of policies, suggesting that packages of policies may be needed to make firms innovate whereas a more targeted approach is needed to increase the intensity of their innovations (with Pierre Mohnen).Mohnen, P., R√∂ller, L.H. (2005). Complementarities in innovation policy. European Economic Review, 49(6), pp. 1431-1450. * Reflecting the need to evaluate the efficiencies of corporate mergers on a case-by-case basis, first assessing mergers through routine tools with modest information requirements and then assessing them further, including an efficiency defence, may be an information efficient framework for evaluations (with Johan Stennek and Frank Verboven).R√∂ller, L.H., Stennek, J., Verboven, F. (2000). Efficiency gains from mergers. Berlin: WZB. * In particular due to the alignment of the pricing strategies of mobile phone services operators across multiple markets and the cross-ownership of licenses, the prices for such services in the U.S. during the 1980s were significantly above those to be expected under perfect competition or in a non-cooperative duopoly (as existed due to the award of two licenses per geographic region by the FCC), suggesting substantial gains to deregulation (with Philip Parker).Parker, P.M., R√∂ller, L.H., (1997). Collusive conduct in duopolies: multimarket contact and cross-ownership in the mobile telephone industry. RAND Journal of Economics, 28(2), pp. 304-322. * If lobbying is efficient, accountability low, mergers large, and profits grow disproportionately as the size of mergers increases, the use of a consumer surplus standard by an antitrust agency to assess mergers yields higher welfare than the use of a welfare standard (with Damien Neven).Neven, D.J., R√∂ller, L.H. (2005). Consumer surplus vs. welfare standard in a political economy model of merger control. International Journal of Industrial Organization, 23(9-10), pp. 829-848. * Electoral concerns and lobbying significantly affected the allocation of investments into transportation infrastructure across French regions in 1985-92, whereas concerns for maximizing the economic returns to infrastructure spending doesn't seem to have played a major role (with Olivier Cadot and Andreas Stephan).Cadot, O., R√∂ller, L.H., Stephan, A. (2006). Contribution to productivity or pork barrel? The two faces of infrastructure investment. Journal of Public Economics, 90(6-7), pp. 1133-1153. * Eliminating the gap in technical efficiency between American and European air carriers in 1986 was expected to create annual savings of $4.5 billion (1993 U.S. dollars) and displace about 42,000 across the European air carrier industry (with David H. Good, M. Ishaq Nadiri and Robin Sickles).Good, D.H., R√∂ller, L.H., Sickles, R.C. (1995).

Journal of Productivity Analysis, 4(1-2), pp. 115-125. * The decisions of the European Commission on merger control are not only determined by concerns over consumer protection, though they don't seem sensitive to firms' interests; instead, other institutional and political factors, e.g. the definition of a market's scope, procedural aspects, and country and industry specificities, appear to be significant (with Neven and Tomaso Duso).Duso, T., Neven, D.J., R√∂ller, L.H.

A Pdr1p dimer binds to PDRE and recruits transcriptional machineries necessary for transcription. Pdr1p (Pleiotropic Drug Resistance 1p) is a transcription factor found in yeast and is a key regulator of genes involved in general drug response. It induces the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter, which can export toxic substances out of the cell, allowing cells to survive under general toxic chemicals. It binds to DNA sequences that contain certain motifs called pleiotropic drug response element (PDRE). Pdr1p is encoded by a gene called PDR1 (also known as YGL013C) on chromosome VII.  Transcriptional role  260x260pxPdr1p is a main regulator of PDR genes and is known to target about 50 genes. Pdr1p binds to sequence 5'-TCCGYGGR-3' of PDRE, which is located within the promoter sequences of its target genes. 218 genes are reported to possess PDRE. Pdr1p is observed to bind PDRE sites on DNA at basal level and also after simulation with toxins. This shows that Pdr1p-DNA interaction isn't dependent on toxic stimulation. This also suggests an involvement of activator(s) or co-activator(s) that induce PDR genes along with Pdr1p. Pdr1p has a functional homolog called Pdr3p encoded by gene called PDR3. Pdr3p is known to be regulated by Pdr3p and Pdr1p. Pdr1p can form a homodimer with itself or heterodimer with Pdr3p. Loss of function studies of both PDR1 and PDR3 revealed that Pdr1p mutant shows lower tolerance (grows less in culture) against organic toxins such as cycloheximide and oligomycin. This confirms the functions of Prf1p that confer stronger drug response phenotype than Pdr3p. However, Pdr3p is crucial for PDR responses since cells containing loss of function mutation in both PDR1 and PDR3 genes weren't able to grow at all in the presence of those two toxins. Both Pdr1p and Pdr3p regulate Pdr5p, which is an ATP-binding cassette transporter. A single amino acid substitution mutation, which is a gain of function mutation of Pdr1p denoted as pdr1-3 (F815S, substitution mutation of Phenylalanine at 815th of the polypeptide by Serine) leads to an over-expression of mRNA of PDR5, which codes for Pdr5p. For cells treated with fluphenazine, Pdr1p was the only transcription factor necessary for PDR response genes induction. But at basal level, Pdr1p can be partially compensated by Pdr3p, a functional homolog of Pdr1p.  Structure  Protein structure of Pdr1p, having two main domains in N- and C-terminus ends. Pdr1p and Pdr3p is a part of Gal4 transcription factor family due to their zinc-finger DNA binding motif, which is located in N-terminus end of Pdr1p. Pdr1p also contains a long internal region of many inhibitory domains and possess a C-terminal transcription activation domain (amino acids 879‚Äì1036). The transcriptional activation domain is rich in glutamine and asparagine, which is theorized to facilitate in protein-protein interaction via hydrogen bonding. A study found that DNA-binding domain of Pdr1p was sufficient for recognizing its endogenous target genes. Strong drug resistance phenotype of yeasts with pdr1-3 is speculated due to its inability to bind to ligands that otherwise cause conformational change to inhibit the transcriptional activity of Pdr1p.  Interaction with other transcription factors  Pdr1p and Pdr3p also interact with other transcription factors and their associated networks such as Yap1p, which controls oxidative stress response, and Rpn4p, which regulates proteasome activities, depending on the kinds of toxins cells face. It is known that Pdr1p induces the expression of Rpn4p.  Importance  Drugs or toxic chemicals are useful in killing pathogenic bacteria or tumor cells, and studying how they mechanistically develop tolerance to a wide range of drugs can improve anti-bacterial and cancer therapeutics. Pdr5p has a similar mechanism of actions and functions to human multidrug resistance protein, whose overexpression is shown to provide chemical tolerance to cancer cells. Studying Pdr5p and how it is regulated by Pdr1p in yeast can give insights into how multi drug resistance occurs in mammals. By using pdr1-3 and fusing the promoter of Pdr5p to genes that code for membrane proteins of interests, yeast membrane proteins such as Pdr5p, Yor1, and Drs2 can be expressed highly so that they can be efficiently cloned and purified for further studies.

In Uttar Pradesh, 43 died in the city of Agra and about 30 died elsewhere in the state. In neighboring Rajasthan, about 35 people died and over 200 were injured after winds downed more than 8,000 electricity poles and uprooted hundreds of trees. Storms are not uncommon in the region; however, because these storms occurred at night and with greater wind speeds than average, the death toll was higher than usual. Background Dust storms are a feature of India's seasonal weather patterns. The storms typically occur in the summer months, when the weather has been dry to allow dust to be picked up by passing winds. The death toll in such storms rarely exceeds 12; a previous storm hit India on 11 April 2018, killing 19 people Dust Storm and its Damage The dust storm occurred at the start of India's monsoon season. In the days prior, region meteorologists had forecast thunderstorms and high winds to occur over that week. Contributing to the storm was a period of abnormally high temperatures for the region, which increased the intensity of the weather system. The dust storm first started late on 2 May 2018, predominantly hitting the states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. At least 73 people were killed in Uttar Pradesh, with 43 of those in the city of Agra; 21 people have been reported killed in Kheragarh, a town around 50 km south-west of the city. At least 35 people were killed in Rajasthan, with the Alwar district being the worst hit; the Bharatpur and Dholpur districts were also affected. Four people died in the state of Uttarakhand, and Delhi was also affected. More than 200 people were injured by the storm. Officials stated that the storm was more devastating than prior dust storms as the stronger weather system carried more debris which caused more damage to homes and buildings, and because it struck at night, most were asleep and were unable to take precautions, leaving many killed or injured by falling structures. Most damage and fatalities were associated with high winds, rather than dust. In Rajasthan, electricity supplies were interrupted by 200‚Äì300 downed pylons, and schools were closed in the Alwar district. Because conditions were still prime for more severe weather, the Uttar Pradesh government continued to plan to alert its citizens to weather conditions for the following 48 hours. Aftermath The Government of Uttar Pradesh has announced compensation for the relatives of those killed amounting to .
