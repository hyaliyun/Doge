A 19-year-old student at the time, Wu managed to convince Li Yuanhong, the revolutionaries' commander-in-chief, to allow her to raise the \\"Women's Revolutionary Army\\" which eventually counted between 100 and several hundred members. Despite having almost no military experience, Wu proved to be a capable commander and personally led her unit into combat during the Battles of Hankou and Nanjing, achieving some fame among the Chinese rebels in the process. Nevertheless, her unit was disbanded after the revolution and Wu's later life is unknown.  Life  = Background = Wu was born to Han Chinese parents at Hanyang, Hubei, in 1892. Noted for her physical strength, bravery and intelligence by contemporaries, Wu was deeply convinced of gender equality and believed that every citizen, regardless of gender, should support and defend their nation. In her case, that meant fighting for the \\"Great Han nation\\" against foreign powers and the ruling Qing dynasty. She regarded the latter as \\"Manchu bastards\\" who suppressed the Han Chinese. = Formation of the Women's Revolutionary Army = Due to her readiness to take up arms in order to fight for the Xinhai Revolution against the Manchu Qing dynasty, contemporaries likened Wu Shuqing to Hua Mulan, a legendary Chinese woman warrior. When the Wuchang Uprising against the Qing government broke out in October 1911, Wu was 19 and attended Hanyang's Fengtian Normal College. Soon after the uprising's start, she sent a letter to the revolutionaries' commander-in-chief, Li Yuanhong, proposing the formation of an armed female brigade to aid the rebels. Though other women would also take up arms as the revolution spread, Wu was believed to have been the first to suggest the formation of a women's army. Li initially rejected this proposal, believing that it would be difficult to incorporate women into the all-male rebel army. Wu refused to accept this, and sent the general a second letter on 31 October while simultaneously publishing her views in the Minli Newspaper. She stated that her desire to join battle did not stem from desire for \\"momentary glory\\". Instead, she considered it her duty to fight for the revolution and, if necessary, die in battle. She reasoned that since men of every societal class and region were joining the rebels, it was not justifiable to exclude women, especially since many of the latter had trained in the gymnasia to prepare themselves for the physical demands of war. Following this second letter and requests by other militant women who wanted to fight for the revolution, Li relented and gave Wu the permission to raise an all-female unit. Wu then posted notices for her unit in Hanyang, while like-minded women produced propaganda for her militia. For example, Liu Wangli likened Wu to the legendary woman warrior Hua Mulan in order to inspire other women to enlist. The recruitment drive was a success, and hundreds women tried to join Wu's unit. Most of these potential recruits were students with a middle-class background, some of them with bound feet. Historians differ on how many Wu's unit, the so-called \\"Women's Revolutionary Army\\", eventually numbered; according to Louise Edwards it was about 100, whereas Ono Kazuko and Fan Hong report that \\"perhaps as many as several hundred women\\" fought under Wu's command. = Combat and later life = Painting of T. Miyano depicting an attack of female rebel fighters at Nanjing in 1911 Wu personally organized and trained the Women's Revolutionary Army in just ten days, and then led them into combat during the Battle of Hankou. Historian Su Xiao comments that Wu proved to be a capable commander, using her barely trained but highly motivated troops to bypass Qing forces near Hankou and then attack them from behind. She and her unit quickly gained some renown for their good combat performance. The Women's Revolutionary Army then relocated to the east, taking part in the Battle for Nanjing alongside several other female rebel militias. At Nanjing, Wu planned and carried out the attack on the strategically important Shizishen fort. Following the revolution's end, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China ordered the disbandment of all Chinese women military units on 26 February 1912. It is not known what happened to Wu after her military career.

It transported three crew members of the Expedition 63 crew to the International Space Station. Soyuz MS-17 is the 145th crewed flight of a Soyuz spacecraft. The crew consists of a Russian commander and a Russian and American flight engineer. The mission marked the first use of a new \\"ultrafast\\" two-orbit rendezvous flight plan with the Soyuz, which saw Soyuz MS-17 arrive at the ISS within approximately three hours after the launch. Towards the end of the flight, the spacecraft will relocate from Rassvet to Poisk to make way for the arrival and docking of the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft, currently set to launch on 1 April 2021 carrying cosmonauts Oleg Novitsky, Pyotr Dubrov and Andrei Borisenko to the ISS ahead of a six-month stay. The two spacecraft will have a nine-day handover period before Soyuz MS-17 departs. This is necessary to avoid de-crewing the Russian Segment (ROS) of the ISS since no Russian cosmonaut will be present aboard SpaceX Crew-1. After this launch, the current schedules are unclear on whether any American astronaut will be aboard on later Soyuz launches.  Crew  = Backup crew = = Reserve crew =  Crew notes  Early planning had listed Russian cosmonaut Nikolai Chub as the mission's Flight Engineer 2, pending a NASA decision on whether they would purchase more seats on the Soyuz. In May 2020, NASA purchased a Soyuz seat and assigned NASA astronaut Kathleen Rubins to the Flight Engineer 2 position, backed up by astronaut Mark T. Vande Hei. Originally Russian cosmonauts Anatoli Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner were set to fly as Commander and Flight Engineer 1 respectively. In February 2020, however, the two cosmonauts were moved to the Soyuz MS-16 flight due to medical issues with the commander of Soyuz MS-16, Nikolai Tikhonov. Ivanishin and Vagner were replaced by Ryzhikov and Kud-Sverchkov. Babkin may fly on Soyuz MS-18, Tikhonov has retired from Roscosmos' astronaut corps. Reacting to the COVID-19 pandemic, Roscosmos implemented a two-cosmonaut reserve crew to ensure the flight could go on with no delays, in the unlikely event both the prime and backup crews fall ill. It was not confirmed whether NASA planned to add an astronaut of their own to the reserve crew.

The effect is possible due to nonlinear dependence of the friction-drag force on the particle's velocity. It was discovered theoretically., and is mainly known as nonlinear electrofrictiophoresis . At first glance, a periodic driving force with zero mean is able to entrain a particle into an oscillating movement without unidirectional drift, because integral momentum provided to the particle by the force is zero. The possibility of unidirectional drift can be recognized if one takes into account that the particle itself loses momentum through transferring it further to the medium it moves in/at. If the friction is nonlinear, then it may so happen that the momentum loss during movement in one direction does not equal to that in the opposite direction and this causes unidirectional drift. For this to happen, the driving force time-dependence must be more complicated than it is in a single sinusoidal harmonic. A simple example - Bingham plastic =Nonlinear friction= The simplest case of friction-velocity dependence law is the Stokes's one: : (1) \\\\qquad F_{dr}(v)=\\\\lambda v, where F_{dr}(v) is the friction/drag force applied to a particle moving with velocity v in a medium. The friction-velocity law (1) is observed for a slowly moving spherical particle in a Newtonian fluid.Fig. 1 Linear friction It is linear, see Fig. 1, and is not suitable for nonlinear frictiophoresis to take place. The characteristic property of the law (1) is that any, even a very small driving force is able to get particle moving. This is not the case for such media as Bingham plastic. For those media, it is necessary to apply some threshold force, d , to get the particle moving. This kind of friction-velocity (dry friction) law has a jump discontinuity at v=0: : (2) \\\\qquad F_{dr}(v)=\\\\lambda v + d\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{sign}(v). Fig. 2 Nonlinear friction example It is nonlinear, see Fig. 2, and is used in this example. =Periodic driving force= Let T>0 denote the period of driving force. Chose a time value t_1 such that 0 and two force values, F^+>0, F^-<0 such that the following relations are satisfied: : \\\\qquad \\\\qquad F^+>d,\\\\quad F^- : (3) \\\\qquad F^+ t_1 + F^-(T-t_1)=0. The periodic driving force f(t) used in this example is as follows: : (4) \\\\qquad f(t)=\\\\begin{cases} F^+, \\\\text{ if }0 It is clear that, due to (3), f(t) has zero mean: : \\\\int\\\\limits_0^T f(t)dt=F^+ t_1 + F^-(T-t_1)=0. Fig. 3 Zero mean driving force example See also Fig. 3. =Unidirectional drift= For the sake of simplicity, we consider here the physical situation when inertia may be neglected. The latter can be achieved if particle's mass is small, velocity is low and friction is high. This conditions have to ensure that \\\\tau\\\\ll t_1, where \\\\tau is the relaxation time. In this situation, the particle driven with force (4) immediately starts moving with constant velocity v^+=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}(F^+-d) during interval 0 and will immediately stop moving during interval t_1, see Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Velocity with nonzero mean This results in the positive mean velocity of unidirectional drift: : \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\overline{v(t)}=\\\\frac{1}{T}\\\\int\\\\limits_0^T v(t)dt = \\\\frac{t_1}{\\\\lambda T}(F^+-d)>0. Mathematical analysis Analysis of possibility to get a nonzero drift by periodic force with zero integral has been made in . The dimensionless equation of motion for a particle driven by periodic force f(t), f(t+1)=f(t), \\\\int_0^1f(t)dt=0 is as follows: : (5)\\\\qquad \\\\dot{v}+\\\\lambda v -\\\\epsilon g(v) = f(t), where the friction/drag force F_{dr}(v)=\\\\lambda v -\\\\epsilon g(v) satisfies the following: : \\\\qquad\\\\qquad F_{dr}(-v)=-F_{dr}(v),\\\\quad \\\\frac{d}{dv}F_{dr}(v)\\\\ge 0. It is proven in that any solution to (5) settles down onto periodic regime v^*(t), v^*(t+1)=v^*(t), which has nonzero mean: : \\\\qquad\\\\qquad \\\\overline{v^*(t)}=\\\\int\\\\limits_0^1v^*(t)dt e 0, almost certainly, provided f(t) is not antiperiodic.Function f(t) is antiperiodic if for some A the following relation f(t+A)=-f(t) holds for all t. Individual harmonics, like \\\\sin(\\\\omega t), are antiperiodic. For g(v)=v^3, two cases of f(t) have been considered explicitly: 1\\\\. Saw-shaped driving force, see Fig. 5: Fig. 5 Saw- shaped driving force : \\\\qquad\\\\qquad f(t)=at,\\\\quad t\\\\in[-1/2;1/2],\\\\quad f(t+1)=f(t),\\\\quad t\\\\in ]-\\\\infty;\\\\infty[. In this case, found in first order in \\\\epsilon approximation to v^*(t), v_1^*(t), has the following mean value: : \\\\qquad\\\\qquad \\\\Big\\\\overline{v^*_1(t)}\\\\Big \\\\equiv\\\\Big\\\\int\\\\limits_0^1v_1^*(t)dt\\\\Big\\\\ge\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\epsilon a^3/\\\\lambda^5. This estimate is made expecting \\\\lambda\\\\gg 1. 2\\\\. Two harmonics driving force, : \\\\qquad\\\\qquad f(t)=a\\\\cos(2\\\\pi t) + b\\\\cos(4\\\\pi t+\\\\psi). In this case, the first order in \\\\epsilon approximation has the following mean value: : \\\\qquad\\\\qquad \\\\Big\\\\overline{v^*_1(t)}\\\\Big=\\\\Big\\\\int\\\\limits_0^1v_1^*(t)dt\\\\Big \\\\ge\\\\frac{2}{27}\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{\\\\lambda}\\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^3 \\\\frac{1} {(1+\\\\frac{4\\\\pi^2}{\\\\lambda^2})(1+\\\\frac{16\\\\pi^2}{\\\\lambda^2})^{1/2}}. This value is maximized in \\\\psi, a,b, keeping a+b=M constant. Interesting that the drift value depends on \\\\psi and changes its direction twice as \\\\psi spans over the interval [0;2\\\\pi]. Another type of analysis, based on symmetry breaking suggests as well that a zero mean driving force is able to generate a directed drift. Applications Fig.6 (a): solid line  the drag force per charge on single b.p. vs velocity, dotted line  linear approximation for comparison. (b): same as (a), but in fine scale In applications, the nature of force f(t) in (5), is usually electric, similar to forces acting during standard electrophoresis. The only differences are that the force is periodic and without constant component. For the effect to show up, the dependence of friction/drag force on velocity must be nonlinear. This is the case for numerous substances known as non-Newtonian fluids. Among these are gels, and dilatant fluids, pseudoplastic fluids, liquid crystals. Dedicated experiments have determined F_{dr}(v) for a standard DNA ladder up to 1500 bp long in 1.5% agarose gel. The dependence found, see Fig. 6, supports the possibility of nonlinear frictiophoresis in such a system. Based on data in Fig. 6, an optimal time course for driving electric field with zero mean, E(t), has been found in, which ensures maximal drift for 1500 b.p. long fragment, see Fig. 7. Fig. 7 Time courses of optimal electric field, E(t), E(t\\\\pm 1s)=E(t), steady- state velocity, v^*(t), and displacement, X(t). The drift value \\\\overline{v^*(t)}=0.31 \\\\mum/s. The effect of unidirectional drift caused by periodic force with zero integral value has a peculiar dependence on the time course of the force applied. See the previous section for examples. This offers a new dimension to a set of separation problems. =DNA separation with respect to length= In the DNA fragments separation, zero mean periodic electric field is used in zero-integrated-field electrophoresis (ZIFE), where the field time dependence similar to that shown in Fig. 3 is used. This allows to separate long fragments in agarose gel, nonseparable by standard constant field electrophoresis. The long DNA geometry and its manner of movement in a gel, known as reptation do not allow to apply directly the consideration based on Eq. (5), above. =Separation with respect to specific mass= It was observed, that under certain physical conditions the mechanism described in Mathematical analysis section, above, can be used for separation with respect to specific mass, like particles made of isotopes of the same material. Extensions The idea of organizing directed drift with zero mean periodic drive have obtained further development for other configurations and other physical mechanism of nonlinearity. =Rotation by means of circular wave= An electric dipole rotating freely around z-axis in a medium with nonlinear friction can be manipulated by applying electromagnetic wave polarized circularly along \\\\pm z and composed of two harmonics. The equation of motion for this system is as follows: : \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\dot{\\\\omega}+\\\\lambda \\\\omega -\\\\epsilon g(\\\\omega) = f(t,\\\\theta(t)),\\\\quad \\\\dot{\\\\theta}=\\\\omega, where f(t,\\\\theta(t)) is the torque acting on the dipole due to circular wave: : (6)\\\\qquad f(t,\\\\theta(t))\\\\sim p(A_1\\\\cos(\\\\omega t\\\\pm\\\\theta)+A_2\\\\cos(2\\\\omega t\\\\pm\\\\theta+\\\\psi)), where p is the dipole moment component orthogonal to z-axis and \\\\theta defines the dipole direction in the XY plane. By choosing proper phase shift \\\\psi in (6) it is possible to orient the dipole in any desired direction, \\\\theta_0. The direction \\\\theta_0 is attained due to angular directed drift, which becomes zero when \\\\theta=\\\\theta_0. A small detuning between the first and second harmonic in (6) results in continuous rotational drift. =Modification of potential function= Fig. 8 Example of modification of potential function U(x) due to nonlinear frictiophoresis. (a) initial U(x), (b) modified U(x). If a particle undergoes a directed drift while moving freely in accordance with Eq. (5), then it drifts similarly if a shallow enough potential field U(x) is imposed. Equation of motion in that case is: : \\\\qquad\\\\qquad \\\\dot{v}+\\\\lambda v -\\\\epsilon g(v) = f(t) - \\\\phi(x),\\\\quad \\\\dot{x}=v, where \\\\phi(x) is the force due to potential field. The drift continues until a steep enough region in the course of U(x) is met, which is able to stop the drift. This kind of behavior, as rigorous mathematical analysis shows, results in modification of U(x) by adding a linear in x term. This may change the U(x) qualitatively, by, e.g. changing the number of equilibrium points, see Fig. 8. The effect may be essential during high frequency electric field acting on biopolymers. =Another nonlinearity= For electrophoresis of colloid particles under a small strength electric field, the force f(t) in the right-hand side of Eq. (5) is linearly proportional to the strength E(t) of the electric field applied. For a high strength, the linearity is broken due to nonlinear polarization. As a result, the force may depend nonlinearly on the applied field: : \\\\qquad\\\\qquad f(t)\\\\sim E(t)+\\\\alpha (E(t))^3. In the last expression, even if the applied field, E(t) has zero mean, the applied force f(t) may happen to have a constant component that can cause a directed drift. As above, for this to happen, E(t) must have more than a single sinusoidal harmonic. This same effect for a liquid in a tube may serve in electroosmotic pump driven with zero mean electric field.

Progress towards targets will be measured by 23 indicators.  Background  Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations. The broad goals are interrelated though each has its own targets to achieve. The SDGs cover a broad range of social and economic development issues. These include poverty, hunger, health, education, climate change, gender equality, Water supply, sanitation, energy, urbanization, environment and social justice.United Nations (2015) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 25 September 2015, Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (A/RES/70/1) The SDGs include an emphasis on the importance of achieving progress on peaceful and inclusive societies, access to justice and rule of law, and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions.United Nations (2017) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017, Work of the Statistical Commission pertaining to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (A/RES/71/313) Global Covid 19 pandemic is predicted to increase the frequency of conflicts as countries blame others for their situation. Its also expected that global peace and security will be on threat with over 60% countries risking the spread of covid 19 in prisons due to overcrowding.  Targets, indicators and progress  SDG 16 has twelve targets and twenty-four indicators. Two of the targets specify their end year (by 2030) while the others do not have a specific end year. Below is the list of all the targets with a short version and a long version of the titles.Ritchie, Roser, Mispy, Ortiz-Ospina. \\"Measuring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.\\" (SDG 16) SDG-Tracker.org, website (2018) World map for indicator 16.1.1 - Number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population in 2016 No data is available yet for the following indicators: 16.4.1, 16.4.2, 16.6.2, 16.7.1, 16.7.2, 16.b.1. For all the other indicators, data and world maps are available to visualize progress. = Target 16.1: Reduce violence everywhere = Long title: \\"Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere.\\" This target has four indicators: * Indicator 16.1.1 Number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, by sex and age. * Indicator 16.1.2 Conflict-related deaths per 100,000 population, by sex, age and cause. * Indicator 16.1.3 Proportion of population subjected to (a) physical violence, (b) psychological violence and (c) sexual violence in the previous 12 months. * Indicator 16.1.4 Proportion of population that feel safe walking alone around the area they live. = Target 16.2: Protect children from abuse, exploitation, trafficking and violence = Child Protection and Development Center Long title: \\"End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children.\\" This target has three indicators: * Indicator 16.2.1: Proportion of children aged 1‚Äì17 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month. * Indicator 16.2.2: Number of victims of human trafficking per 100,000 population, by sex, age and form of exploitation. * Indicator 16.2.3: Proportion of young women and men aged 18‚Äì29 years who experienced sexual violence by age 18. One target is to see the end to sex trafficking, forced labor, and all forms of violence against and torture of children. However, reliance on the indicator of \\"crimes reported\\" makes monitoring and achieving this goal challenging. For instance, 84 percent of countries have no or insufficient data on violent punishment of children. Of the data available, it is clear that violence against children by their caregivers remains pervasive: Nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 are subjected to violent discipline on a regular basis (regardless of income), and no country is on track to eliminate violent discipline by 2030. By 2017, the UN could report progress on detecting victims of trafficking. More women and girls than men and boys were victimized, yet the share of women and girls has slowly declined (see also violence against women). In 2004, 84 percent of victims were females and by 2014 that number had dropped to 71 percent. Sexual exploitation numbers have declined, but forced labor has increased. US Department of Justice Scales Of Justice = Target 16.3: Promote the rule of law and ensure equal access to justice = The full text of Target 16.3: \\"Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all.\\" This target has three indicators: * Indicator 16.3.1: Proportion of victims of violence in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms. * Indicator 16.3.2: Unsentenced detainees as a proportion of overall prison population. * Indicator 16.3.3: Proportion of the population who have experienced a dispute in the past two years and who accessed a formal or informal dispute resolution mechanism, by type of mechanism. = Target 16.4: Combat organized crime and illicit financial and arms flows = The full text of Target 16.4: \\"By 2030, significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organized crime.\\" The target has two indicators: * Indicator 16.4.1: Total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows (in current United States dollars). * Indicator 16.4.2: Proportion of seized, found or surrendered arms whose illicit origin or context has been traced or established by a competent authority in line with international instruments. = Target 16.5: Substantially reduce corruption and bribery = The full text of Target 16.5: \\"Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms.\\" The target has two indicators: * Indicator 16.5.1: Proportion of persons who had at least one contact with a public official and who paid a bribe to a public official, or were asked for a bribe by those public officials, during the previous 12 months. * Indicator 16.5.2: Proportion of businesses that had at least one contact with a public official and that paid a bribe to a public official, or were asked for a bribe by those public officials during the previous 12 months. With regards to bribery: Data from 38 countries over the past decade suggest that high-income countries have the lowest prevalence of bribery (an average of 3.7 per cent), while lower-income countries have high levels of bribery when accessing public services (22.3 per cent). = Target 16.6: Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions = The full text of Target 16.6: \\"Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels.\\" The target has two indicators: * Indicator 16.6.1: Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector (or by budget codes or similar). * Indicator 16.6.2: Proportion of population satisfied with their last experience of public services. = Target 16.7: Ensure responsive, inclusive and representative decision-making = The full text of Target 16.7: \\"Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.\\" The target has two indicators: * Indicator 16.7.1: Proportions of positions in national and local institutions, including (a) the legislatures; (b) the public service; and (c) the judiciary, compared to national distributions, by sex, age, persons with disabilities and population groups. * Indicator 16.7.2: Proportion of population who believe decision-making is inclusive and responsive, by sex, age, disability and population group. World map for indicator 16.9.1 - Proportion of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority. = Target 16.8: Strengthen the participation in global governance = The full text of Target 16.8: \\"Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance.\\". The target has a single indicator Indicator 16.8.1 is the \\"Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations\\". = Target 16.9: Provide universal legal identity = The full text of Target 16.9: \\"By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.\\". It has one indicator: Indicator 16.9.1 is the \\"Proportion of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age\\". Target 16.9 also targets universal legal identity and birth registration, ensuring the right to a name and nationality, civil rights, recognition before the law, and access to justice and social services. With more than a quarter of children under 5 unregistered worldwide as of 2015, about 1 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress to achieve universal birth registration by 2030. = Target 16.10: Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms = The full text of Target 16.10: \\"Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.\\" The target has two indicators: * Indicator 16.10.1 Number of verified cases of killing, kidnapping, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention and torture of journalists, associated media personnel, trade unionists and human rights advocates in the previous 12 months. * Indicator 16.10.2 Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information. = Target 16.a: Strengthen national institutions to prevent violence and combat crime and terrorism = The full text of Target 16.a: \\"Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime.\\" It has one indicator Indicator 16.a.1 is the \\"Existence of independent national human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles\\". = Target 16.b: Promote and enforce non-discriminatory laws and policies = The full text of Target 16.b: \\"Promote and enforce non-discriminatory laws and policies for sustainable development.\\" It has one indicator Indicator 16.b.1 is the \\"Proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed in the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law\\". = Custodian agencies = Custodian agencies are responsible for monitoring and reporting of indicators: * Indicator 16.1.1: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and World Health Organisation (WHO). * Indicator 16.1.2: Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) * Indicator 16.1.3 and 16.1.4: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) * Indicator 16.2.1 and 16.2.3: United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) * Indicators 16.2.2, 16.3.2 and 16.5.1 is: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) * Indicator 16.4.1: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNTAD) * Indicator 16.4.2: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs * Indicator 16.5.2: World Bank (WB) and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). * Indicator 16.6.1: World Bank (WB) * Indicator 16.6.2 and for two indicators under Target 16.7 is: United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). * Indicator 16.8.1: Department of Economic and Social Affairs-Financing for Development Office (DESA/FFDO) * Indicator 16.9.1: Department of Economic and Social Affairs-Statistics Division (DESA/UNSD) and United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). * Indicator 16.10.1, 16.a.1 and 16.b.1: Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). * Indicator 16.10.2: United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization-Institute for Statistics (UNESCO-UIS)  Monitoring and progress  High-level progress reports for all the SDGs are published in the form of reports by the United Nations Secretary General. The most recent one is from April 2020.United Nations Economic and Social Council (2020) Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals Report of the Secretary- General, High-level political forum on sustainable development, convened under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council (E/2020/57), 28 April 2020 The International Programme for the Development of Communication is responsible for the follow-up of the SDG 16 through indicators 16.10.1 and 16.10.2. Every two years, a report containing information from the Member States on the status of judicial inquiries on each of the killings condemned by UNESCO is submitted to the IPDC Council by UNESCO's Director- General.http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives The journalists safety indicators is a tool developed by UNESCO which, according to UNESCO's website, aims on mapping the key features that can help assess the safety of journalists, and help determine whether adequate follow-up is given to crimes committed against them.For international-level indicators see: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002608/260892E.pdf For national-level indicators see: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002608/260893E.pdf The IPDC Talks also allow the Programme to raise awareness on the importance of access to information. The IPDC also monitors and reports on access to information laws around the world through the United Nations Secretary-General global report on follow-up to SDGs.  Links with other SDGs  The Sustainable Development Goals are not taken as being completely independent one from the other, but rather as being closely linked. In this way, media development enhances freedom of speech, peace, but also contributes to sustainability, poverty eradication and human rights. Fostering peace and inclusive societies can help reduce inequalities (SDG10) and help economies prosper (SDG8). The 2012 outcome document of the United Nations Summit on the 2030 Agenda considers that sustainable development can not be achieved without building peaceful, just and inclusive societies and addressing issues of corruption, poor governance, insecurity and injustice.  Organizations  = UN organizations = The United Nations Development Programme is the United Nations global development network which is concerned with SDG 16. Hence, the Program focuses on democratic governance and peace building.See official website: http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/democratic-governance-and- peacebuilding.html The UNDP also works on conflict prevention by empowering youth, especially women. Also, they aim at supporting the frameworks and structure and by acting as mediators. UNESCO has revealed diverse contributions to improve the scope of SDG 16 including: * UNESCO's communication and information sector is responsible for targets 16.3 (access to justice), 16.5 (anti-corruption and transparent and accountable institutions). It aims to: \\"foster intercultural dialogue, culture of peace and non-violence, and prevent violent extremism through global citizenship education; support free, independent and pluralistic media, ensure the safety of journalists; protect cultural and natural heritage, strengthen governance systems for culture and enhance fundamental freedoms.\\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002477/247785e.pdf * Preventing violent extremism is a way to promote, in official wording, a \\"culture of peace and non-violence\\" for UNESCO. The Organization aims to prevent violent extremism by using education as a tool to strengthen global citizenship, by mobilizing youth, women and other stakeholders to take actions, online and offline, to prevent and respond to violent extremism and radicalization on the Internet.http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002603/260382e.pdf *Freedom of speech - UNESCO, as the United Nations agency with the specific mandate to promote \\"the free flow of ideas by word and image\\", supports a free, independent and pluralistic media in print, broadcast and on the Internet. = NGOs and foundations = * Justice Rapid Response is the only global facility that provides rapidly deployable experts in a wide range of highly specialized fields to assist with investigations in situations where war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, and serious human rights violations may have occurred.See official website: https://www.justicerapidresponse.org/ * The international peacebuilding organisation Saferworld have pioneered a localization approach for SDG16+ ‚Äì in an attempt to promote national ownership of commitments made under SDG16 and within the wider 2030 Agenda to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies.Putting SDG16+ into practice: https://www.saferworld.org.uk/multimedia/putting-sdg16-into-practice * The anti-corruption non-governmental organization Transparency International monitors corruption in over a hundred countries and aims to \\"gives voice to the victims and witnesses of corruption\\" and \\"stop the abuse of power, bribery and secret deals\\".

It was organized in 2003 by a group of attorneys, most of whom had already practiced together for nearly a decade. The firm focuses on solving problems that involve environmental, land use, public and private lands, infrastructure, and transportation law.  History and Formation  Kaplan Kirsch & Rockwell was founded in 2003 by a group of six attorneys, most of whom had previously practiced at a boutique environmental law firm until its 2000 merger with a large international law firm. All of the founding partners practiced transportation, infrastructure, land use, and environmental law, with a focus on large public development projects and private sector projects with a significant public investment component. At the time of its founding, the firm's attorneys had all built national reputations in transit-oriented and brownfield development, in environmental law, and in airport development projects. The firm later grew to incorporate transit and rail projects in 2006 and public-private partnerships in 2017.  Notable Projects  = Airports = Starting in the late 1990s, members of the firm led negotiations for a 7-year standstill between the Hollywood Burbank Airport and the city of Los Angeles that led to a development agreement that allowed terminal improvements to meet contemporary design and security needs. The principle was that a standstill or d√©tente might reduce tensions and pave the way for a long-term peace between the airport and its neighbors, which proved to be successful. Most recently, Kaplan Kirsch & Rockwell led the City in negotiations for a final resolution of the 45-year dispute. This agreement changes the governance of the Airport Authority to give city appointees greater influence over major airport decisions, provides for a development agreement for the replacement of the airport terminal on a new site, enables the use of adjacent property for airport-oriented commercial development, and approves the replacement terminal. The final set of agreements was approved by the voters in a referendum in November 2016. In 2013, the firm successfully led a coalition of more than 40 small commercial service airports in litigation and an aggressive legislative effort to reinstate funding for federal contract air traffic control towers after federal sequestration cuts would have eliminated towers at 250 airports nationwide. The firm filed multiple lawsuits in many federal courts of appeals, assisted in developing a public communications strategy, and helped lead a legislative lobbying and communications strategy in the Congress with active involvement by the American Association of Airport Executives and state aviation groups. The firm has represented Clark County, Nevada, owner of the Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, for decades in a variety of matters; including a 2011 petition concerning its proposal to discount airline landing fees in the event that the airline increases its landed weight. Additionally, the firm supervised the preparation and approval of environmental assessments associated with airfield and terminal improvements at McCarran, advised on the management, use, and disposition of Bureau of Land Management lands needed for airport development, and provided continuing counsel on matters relating to noise, air quality compliance, coordination of development and potential height and obstruction impacts on airport operations, as well as general federal regulatory compliance issues. = Rail, Transit, Highways, and Infrastructure = Beginning in 2006, the firm became involved in the Denver Union Station Site Redevelopment, representing the master developer and developing plans for the light rail, commuter rail, AMTRAK, and bus operations. In 2011, the firm served as part of the legal team that represented the Regional Transportation District (RTD) on the EAGLE P3 Project, a $2 billion commuter rail project, with the main line running from Denver Union Station to Denver International Airport. In 2015, the firm was retained by the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico to assist in a lawsuit brought by two groups of plaintiffs representing individuals and businesses along Central Avenue seeking an injunction to stop construction of the Albuquerque Rapid Transit (ART). The firm was able to obtain an accelerated schedule on Plaintiffs‚Äô Motions for Preliminary Injunction and after an accelerated briefing schedule and a three-day evidentiary hearing, Judge Kenneth Gonzales of the U.S. District Court for New Mexico issued a 14-page decision denying the injunction and finding, in particular, that allowing ART to proceed was in the public interest. The firm provided counsel to the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) in the acquisition of rights-of- way from two Class 1 freight railroads for the state's use in developing the Red Line light rail corridor in Baltimore and the Purple Line light rail inter-county connector in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. MTA was represented by the firm in extensive proceedings before the Surface Transportation Board and federal circuit courts in connection with MTA's acquisition and development of its commuter and light rail systems and its efforts to railbank unused corridors, and also assisted MTA in compliance matters before the Federal Railroad Administration. The firm represented King County, Washington in contested proceedings before the Surface Transportation Board to secure approval as the trail sponsor under the National Trails Act. King County had to defend the trail from attacks by neighboring landowners asserting reversionary property interests in the railbanked right-of-way and two attempts by start-up railroads to obtain rights to use the right-of-way based on speculative plans to provide freight rail service in suburban Seattle. In 2016, the DC Department of Transportation (DDOT) announced the return of DC streetcars to Washington, DC after a hiatus of over 50 years, and the firm assisted DDOT in negotiations with the Federal Transit Administration and the local safety oversight agency to establish safety management systems for the new service. In early 2018, the firm helped its client the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), with a proposed reconstruction a 10-mile stretch of I-70 east of downtown Denver. Opponents of the re-design filed two lawsuits, claiming that CDOT had failed to properly analyze the environmental impacts of the project under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Air Act. After reviewing briefings from firm attorneys, the court denied both preliminary injunction motions. In its orders, the court held that the plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of any of their legal claims, including claims that the Federal Highway Administration and CDOT had insufficiently considered the Project's impacts on air quality and public health. = Environment, Public Lands, and Conservation = Beginning in 2008, the firm represented a local government in western Colorado in litigation over the validity of water rights speculatively held by other entities in the watershed and were able to achieve a strong settlement that eliminated two major dam sites on this free-flowing river‚Äìone that is eligible for designation as a National Wild and Scenic River. In 2014 it was announced that the city of Denver would begin redevelopment of the Former Gates Rubber Company Site, and the firm was brought on to assist in the negotiation of the purchase and sale agreement, project due diligence, negotiation of the environmental insurance policy, environmental cleanup and risk management, entitlements, use of special district and tax increment financing, railroad right-of-way issues, transit-oriented development, and private project financing. The firm represented the local redevelopment authority known as PuebloPlex in negotiating with the U.S. Army and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment regarding cleanup requirements and other environmental terms and conditions associated with the transfer to PuebloPlex of approximately 16,000 acres of property within the former U.S. Army Pueblo Chemical Depot in Pueblo, Colorado. In 2017, the City and County of Denver announced it would begin a 100-year contract with the National Western Center, and the firm was involved as council in developing and negotiating the governance structure and framework agreement for expanding and redeveloping the site.  Conservation Easements  The firm represented Walking Mountains Science Center in its conveyance of a conservation easement to the Eagle Valley Land Trust in Edwards, Colorado, funded in part by Eagle County's Open Space Program. This relatively small transaction is focused on conserving the pristine riparian habitat of Buck Creek Valley for educating the public in nature, science, and conservation and the firm aided in furthering environmental stewardship and inspiring sustainability for the current generation as well as the next. Last Dollar Ranch, located on the Dallas Divide near Telluride, Colorado, retained Kaplan Kirsch & Rockwell in the conveyance of a conservation easement to the American Farmland Trust. The firm worked with various experts, including the appraiser, biologist, surveyor, and title insurance company and eventually the easement doubled the amount of protected land. In 2016, the firm represented the owners of the Navajo Headwaters Ranch in the conveyance of several conservation easements to Colorado Open Lands, facilitated by The Conservation Fund. The land is located in the southern San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado, and the team worked on several corporate and debt related issues while taking advantage of the Colorado Conservation Easement Tax Credit. = Energy = The firm represented Interwest Energy Alliance, the regional affiliate of the American Wind Energy Association, as an intervenor in the case EELI v. Epel, to help the state of Colorado defend against claims that the Colorado Renewable Energy Standard is unconstitutional. The Tenth Circuit agreed with the state of Colorado, Interwest, and other intervenors that the Colorado standard is constitutional because the RES does not attempt to regulate activity entirely outside of Colorado and does not control prices. In August 2015, Xcel Energy filed a settlement agreement with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission that will impact how electricity is produced and paid for in Colorado. The firm represented the Solar Energy Industries Association in the months of negotiations that lead to this agreement. The settlement expands solar access to low-income customers and significantly increases Colorado's capacity for solar energy by facilitating the development of a new 50-megawatt solar facility, providing for the acquisition of more than 300 megawatts of community solar gardens and distributed solar in a move that was deemed a big win for the solar industry.

This particular caddisfly is found in and near streams of North America, from northern California and Colorado to British Columbia and as eastern to Nevada, Idaho, Montana and Alberta. D. gilvipes is commonly known as the October Caddis, Autumn Caddis or Giant Orange Sedge, due to their flying presence acknowledged in the Autumn. Caddisflies are known to build cases when they are in larvae stages, to protect themselves from predators, such as dragonflies, salmon and trout. The October Caddisfly is no different and builds their cases out of different organic materials during their five larvae stages.  Habitat  D. gilvipes occur in the Nearctic and eastern Palaearctic regions. This species can be found in and near streams within mid- elevations.  Behavior  By Bob Henricks from Charlottesville, United States - Northern case-maker caddisfly larva, Dicosmoecus gilvipes, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=73339990 = Flight & Reproduction = Males fly more often than females, due to the release of pheromones produced by the females. Females limit flying to make their pheromone trail more apparent to the males for mating. Copulation between mating pairs can last up to 16 hours, and the pair stay together until throughout the attraction period to ensure the female mates with one male. = Diet = D. gilvipes in both larvae and nymph stages are categorized as scraper-grazers. They are grazers on periphyton attached to the submerged rocks in the rivers. They typically eat Diatoms (Synedra ulna and Achnanthes lanceolate) and filamentous algal (Stigeoclonium tenueetae, Ulothrix spp., and Klebsormidium fluitans) with the occasion detritus. = Case Building = D. gilvipes have glands that produce strong silk to help encase their bodies with a suit of armor. During their early life stages of larvae their armor will consist of mostly of leaves and twigs, having more buoyancy while the larvae live on the edge of streams for the ease of transportation during high flows. During late spring and early summer, the armor is reconstructed with gravel as the larvae move into deeper water.  Lifecycle  Every species of Dicosmoecus has five stages of larvae, labeled as instars I-V, within a single brood, which occurs only once per mating season. Egg masses have been found on leaves of trees above streams and on stems of Carex sedges found along streams, suggesting females oviposit in autumn. = Anatomy = One main aspect of larval anatomy of the October Caddisfly consists of various sizes of setae along the body. On the anterior and ventral surfaces of the labrum is covered in long setae, shorter setae on the middle inner labium and dense setae on the lower labium. = Instar stages = Instar I larvae are typically found in early spring, this instar stage is one of the first of the stages to colonize streams that have been scoured by high flood events. The instar I and II larvae cases are constructed with an overlapping pattern consisting of fine twigs and needles. During Instar III stage, larvae begin to incorporate pebbles into their cases. Larvae reaches the fourth instar stage during late April. Instar IV cases consists of coarse sand grains at their anterior and needles and twigs at their posterior. The fifth instar stage is where the larvae is at its largest, averaging at 30 mm in length, with 40 mm being the maximum length reported. This final stage occurs around late summer, the larvae are active until water temperature drops to 0-2 C, during November or December. At this stage, their cases consist of only mineral material and the larvae attach their cases at their anterior to the underside of rocks and boulders, to live overwinter.

He was a nine-term member of the Tripura Legislative Assembly representing the Pratapgarh assembly constituency. Political career Sarkar completed his post-graduation in Bengali language from the Calcutta University, West Bengal. In 1956 he joined the Communist Party of India and later in 1964, when the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was established, he joined the CPI(M). A staunch Communist, Sarkar was first elected to the Tripura Legislative Assembly from the Teliamura (Vidhan Sabha constituency) in 1972 on a Communist Party of India (Marxist) ticket and defeated his opponent Bir Chandra Barman by about 1600 votes. In the next assembly election of 1977 Sarkar changed his constituency to the Pratapgarh (Vidhan Sabha constituency) and won against the Indian National Congress candidate Madhusudan Das by about 7500 votes. In the next election of 1983 Sarkar again defeated Madhusudan Das from the Indian national congress by about 5000 votes. In the 1988 assembly election, Sarkar took on the Indian National Congress' Madhusudan Das, whom he had defeated in the 1977 and 1983 election. The result was the same and Sarkar won by a margin of about 2500 votes. This win sent him for the fourth time to Tripura's lower house. By the time the 1993 assembly election took place, Sarkar was already a four-term MLA and defeated congress's Madhusudan Das by about 7000 votes. In the 1998, 2003, and 2008 Tripura assembly election, Sarkar held the seat defeating Narayan Das and Bimal Chandra Barman of the Indian National Congress. The 2013 election was his last; he defeated Ranjit Kumar Das of the Indian National Congress by a margin of about 2000 votes. Personal life Sarkar was an acclaimed poet, writer, and intellectual. He authored 24 books and received numerous literary awards. In 1971, he was credited with helping provide relief and shelter in Tripura to hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing from the Bangladesh Liberation War. He and his wife had a son.

History  The town of Azezo was established around the same time Gondar was settled in the 16th century (between 1632-1687). Azezo was occupied by the Italians during the follow-up to World War 2, establishing a military camp nearby the village between 1936 and 1941. After the defeat of the Italians by a joint British and Ethiopian force (the Gideon Force), the camp remained operational. In the early 1990s, following the overthrow of the Derg, the camp was partially demobilized and Azezo's main source of income was diminished, with the ecological care of nearby rivers being halted as a result. Azezo today is a suburban market town that is mostly associated with its closest city, Gondar.

The park, expected to be long and encompass , is being created from brownfield sites along the river, which itself is a Superfund site due to decades of pollution. It will follow the river between the Ironbound section along Raymond Boulevard and Downtown Newark along McCarter Highway. Announced in 1999, a groundbreaking took place in 2008, and the first phase of the park opened in 2012. It was the first time residents of the largest city in New Jersey have ever had public access to the river. Other segments of the park have subsequently opened, while others are being developed. The East Coast Greenway uses paths and roads along the park. History The banks of Passaic River had been industrialized, and in some sections later abandoned for many years, and is an EPA Superfund site. Diamond Alkali in the Ironbound section, was a notabe contributor to the contamination.https://www.nj.com/news/2014/04/massive_17_billion_cleanup_of_passaic_river_proposed_by_epa.html The river's remediation, projected in 2014 to cost an estimated $1.7 billion, is to be one of the largest Superfund cleanups ever proposed. While plans for dredging the river to remove contaminants has been planned for many years, it was only more recently that this has been seen as an urban planning opportunity to increase community parks and access to the river itself. Connecting environmental conservation and restoration with intentional park development is a relatively new way to invest in new park infrastructure, as evidenced in increasing research in this area. The United States Army Corps of Engineers has restored much of the shore along the banks of the river in Newark. The project included of bulkhead re-construction, and of riverbank grading and native plantings. The park, originally announced in 1999 with a ground breaking taking place in 2008, is being developed through a partnership with the City of Newark, The Trust for Public Land, the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation, and the Essex County Department of Parks. In its initial stages it was called the Joseph G. Minish Passaic River Waterfront and Historic Area in honor of Joseph Minish. The first phase which parallels Raymond Boulevard, encompasses 12 acres and opened in 2012. Designed by Mott MacDonald, it includes playgrounds, fields for soccer and baseball, a boardwalk, and walking trails. This gave members of the community their first public access to the river in over a century. It was initially known as Essex County Riverfront Park, it is part of the Essex County Park System. The Passaic Riverfront between Dock Bridge and NJPAC, site of phase 4 of the park Phase 2, adjacent to the existing Riverbank Park downstream of the Jackson Street Bridge, opened in 2013 with it one of the more prominent visual elements of the park, a fluorescent orange boardwalk with four large orange poles, viewable from trains on the Northeast Corridor downstream of Newark Penn Station. Phase 3, upstream of Jackson Street Bridge, opened in December 2017, with a ceremony from Newark‚Äôs Mayor Ras J. Baraka. This four-acre section includes walking and bike paths, river overlooks, open exercise equipment in a fitness zone, seating, lighting, and flood resilience features. Ground was broken on phase 4 of the park in October 2017. It was designed by James Corner. The parcels along McCarter Highway are north of Dock Bridge and Newark Penn Station upstream to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC). Land adjacent to the park are zoned for mixed-used development. The park will eventually reach Bridge Street Bridge.

Chengdu Sichuan 1889 d. Shanghai April 14, 1949 ) was a Chinese newspaper publisher and political figure in Republican China. He is best known as the chief editor of the Ta Kung Pao from 1916 to 1923, then as its publisher until his death in 1949. He stood for an independent press and raised professional standards in journalism, but supported the Nationalist government's resistance to Japanese aggression in China, and tried to bridge the gap between the Chinese Communist and Nationalist parties after the war. Hu Zhengzhi was the second of three brothers, the eldest of whom was Hu Xuanzhi. His second wife, Gu Junqi, was the niece of V.K. Wellington Koo. Hu Zhengzhi had five daughters and three sons. Except for Desheng who emigrated to the United States, his other children stayed in China after 1949. Hu Jisheng was the eldest son, the second was Hu Dongsheng; Hu Yan was the daughter of his first wife, while Hu Lan and Hu Desheng were born to Gu Shi. Education and early career After home education in the Chinese classics, Hu went on to a modern school, where he studied natural science and mathematics before going to Japan to study law. There he also met his future partners, Wu Dingchang (Âê¥ÈºéÊòå 1884-1950) and Zhang Jiluan (Âº†Â≠£È∏æ 1888‚Äì1941). When he returned to China in 1911, he passed the Shanghai bar and worked briefly for newspapers associated with Sun Yat-sen used his Japanese language ability as a translator for the Da Gonghe Bao. But when he became editor of the Ta Kung Pao in 1916, he became associated with the Anfu clique, which had just bought a controlling interest in the paper. In the following years he served briefly as a judge, then went to Beijing to teach law and report on events in the capital for the Shanghai papers. When the Japanese government presented the Twenty-One Demands to pressure China into allowing expanded Japanese control, Hu made exclusive reports for his papers using information from Japanese and English language sources. In 1919 Ta Kung Pao financed a tour that took him to twenty countries. In Paris he covered the Peace Conference of 1919 and threw a reception for fellow journalists that included more than 130 guests from fifteen countries, a larger affair than even the Chinese embassy could host. Career in journalism and politics Hu Zhengzhi 1925 In 1926, Hu, Zhang Jiluan, and the banker Wu Dingchang bought all the shares in the paper. Zhang took the role of editor, and Hu was manager and deputy editor. Hu had taken subsidies from Wu, the Anfu Clique and the Nationalists but now wanted the paper to emulate the standards of the Times of London or Japan's Mainichi Shimbun. Wu, as the business head, also held that the paper had to maintain independent funding, talent, and joint efforts. They agreed on a \\"Four Nos Policy\\": \\"no party affiliation, no political endorsements, no self promotion, no ignorance\\". (budang, busi, bumai, bumang) Hu's social views were pro-Western and in line with the New Culture Movement's suspicion of traditional values, but Zhang's stance was more traditional. Ta Kung Pao' maintained a non-party stance but supported Chiang Kai-shek and the Northern Expedition that brought his Nationalist Party to power. The paper used its relatively safe location in Tianjin to write anti-imperialist and anti-warlord editorials as well as to criticize the new government in Nanjing and become an influential voice of liberal opinion. Hu fostered professional standards with generous salaries and profit sharing, recruiting new staff from reporters who had proved themselves at other agencies. He did not hire those with government or Nationalist Party affiliation, but a number of young reporters had left- wing connections or were even Communist Party members. Zhang Jiluan, whose sympathies were more conservative, however, kept good relations with Chiang Kai-shek, helping to keep the paper from being closed down. Circulation grew under Hu's management and the editorship of Zhang Jiluan, but the paper was forced to move to Shanghai in 1936 to avoid Japanese control in Tianjin, then to Hankow in 1937, and Chongqing in 1939.He was appointed to the Chinese People's Political Consulative Conference in 1942 and was a member of a delegation to London in 1943, returning to China after a visit to the United States in 1944. After Zhang's death in 1941, Hu's position became more precarious and his politics more outspokenly liberal. He advocated a \\"constitutional style\\" of equality before the law, multi-party democracy, and government tolerance of opposition. Political Consultative Conference, Chongqing 1946 , Front Row, Zhou Enlai (Center) Hu Zhengzhi (Third from right) In April 1945, Hu attended the inaugural meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco as a representative of the Chinese press and a member of the Chinese delegation, and signed the United Nations He was a delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consulative Conference, held in Chongqing to try to bring the sides together and head off Civil War. After the Japanese surrender in August, Ta Kung Pao resumed publication in Shanghai and Tianjin, with Hu as chair of the Shanghai general management office. The Hong Kong edition resumed in 1948. The paper published an editorial, \\"The Liberals' Belief,\\" (Ziyou zhuyizhe de xinnian) opposing continuation of the Civil War and advocating the Third Way. But as the war continued and both Communist and Nationalist supporters attacked the paper, it shifted to a more left-wing stance. Hu returned to Shanghai, where he died, April 14, 1949, a little more than a month before Communist forces took the city on May 25. After the founding of the People's Republic, Hu came under criticism as a liberal, first for accepting the equivalent of some $US200,000 in subsidies from the Nationalist government and second for his neutral stance. Journalistic philosophy Hu was very much aware of journalism's public responsibilities. As one historian puts it, Hu and such colleagues as Zhang Jiluan and Chen Bosheng felt that a reporter must \\"serve society,\\" and that a journalist much must be both critic and a guide to society, taking on the role of the ancient Confucian tradition. In 1935 he looked back and told his readers that journalism was one of the tools of modern culture, and in China had developed in pretty much the same stages as abroad: from being supported by political patrons to being supported by the market; from literary essays by individual brilliant writers to plentiful and varied features written by stables of writers; from small-scale shops operated by a handful of overworked do-it-alls to a newsrooms made up of specialists; and a readership that had evolved from a small educated social √©lite toward a mass base. Hu put the question: ‚Äúwhy does China have no public opinion?‚Äù His answer was that newspapers and magazines in the West were supported by advertisements for middle-class consumer goods, such as soap and home remedies, but the middle class in China was too small to support the independent press that created public opinion.Hu Zhengzhi, ‚ÄúZuobao yu kanbao‚Äù (Producing newspapers and reading newspapers)‚Äù Dagongbao January 1935, reprinted in Cao Juren, ed., Xiandai Zhongguo baogao wenxue xuan  Notes References    *  External links  * \\"ËÉ°Êîø‰πã\\" Baike.com * ËÉ°Êîø‰πã, Baidu Baike Category:1889 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Chinese journalists Category:Republic of China writers Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Hu Zhengzhi"},{"id":"57245016","text":"Pterostichus protractus is a species of woodland ground beetle in the family Carabidae.

Headrick served in combat in the army in WWII and was a deep-sea welder. He is most well-known as the father of both the modern-day Frisbee and of the sport and game of disc golf. Ed Headrick with his two whippets with a new DGA disc golf lightweight all metal disc golf target. Photo taken in 2002 two months before he died.  Toys  Ed Headrick promoting the Hula Hoop for Wham-O with celebrity Dinah Shore, two competitors and show host. Headrick's career began its tenure at Wham-O where he asked for a job making toys and was told they were not hiring. He asked to be hired without pay to prove his worth and was taken up on his offer. One of his early tasks was finding something to do with all the excess stock of Wham-O hula hoops left over after the Hula Hoop craze had run its course.  Frisbee  Headrick eventually worked his way up to the head of research and development at Wham-O where he experimented with plastics and rubber and designed popular toys like the super ball. Headrick's role was to come up with new toy ideas and to come up with ways to improve toys that were not selling well. It was this job which led him to reevaluate Wham-O's flying saucer which had been created by the American Inventor Walter Frederick Morrison. Photo of Ed Headrick's Frisbee Flying Saucer Patent 3359678 With the flying saucer, Headrick envisioned not a better selling toy, but a redesign and invention of something bigger. Headrick's solution was the Frisbee design which was awarded U.S. Patent #3359678, and is the Frisbee disc design the world is familiar with today. With his new Frisbee design patent, Ed saw the potential to create something more with the Frisbee. Headrick began a marketing and advertising blitz. With Ed's position at Wham-O, he began not only to heavily market the Frisbee by promoting the trick throws and games you could play, but he shifted the focus of the Frisbee to a sport. Ed Headrick promoted the Frisbee, Frisbee games, and Frisbee sports events and rose to the ranks of Executive Vice President at Wham-O. During this time frame Headrick also founded the IFA, the International Frisbee Association that grew to over 85,000 members, to help in the promotion of Frisbee sports. Ed competed in Frisbee Freestyle events and Frisbee sports like GUTS, but also practiced target shooting with Frisbees. Headrick, his son Ken and his friends created object courses through the city and parks. They would walk and challenge each other to hit things like trash cans, signs, trees, etc. with their Frisbees. Some nights Ed, his son Ken and his friends would sneak on to golf courses to play rounds of golf with discs. His skill with the Frisbee earned him the nickname \\"Steady\\". Target shooting with Frisbees became Ed's new passion and he saw tremendous potential in Frisbee Golf as a legitimate game and sport with dedicated courses that regular people could play and even compete in tournaments. At Wham-O, Ed became increasingly focused on Frisbee Golf's potential and wanted to create and standardize a new game and sport called Frisbee Golf. Through Headrick's efforts, the Frisbee brand had become very important to Wham-O's bottom line. As the owners of the Frisbee Trademark, however, Wham-O did not share Ed's same vision for the viability of the standardized game of Frisbee Golf that Ed had. Wham-O would not allow license of the Frisbee trademark to be used for Frisbee Golf. Disc golf In 1975 Ed's tenure at Wham-O ended and ties between Headrick and Wham-O eventually split. Headrick left the company to start out on his own to focus all his efforts on his new interest, which he coined and trademarked \\"Disc Golf\\". =Disc Golf Association= In 1976 \\"Steady\\" Ed Headrick and his son Ken Headrick started the first disc golf company, the Disc Golf Association (DGA). The purpose of DGA was to manufacture discs and targets and to formalize the game for disc golf. The first disc golf target was Ed's pole hole design which basically consisted of a pole sticking out of the ground. = The First Disc Golf Basket = Ed Headrick's Flying Disc Entrapment Device Patent 4039189. The first disc golf target made with chains that became the standard for disc golf. In 1977, Headrick and his son Ken developed the modern basket catch for disc golf, US Patent 4,039,189, titled Flying Disc Entrapment Device, which they trademarked \\"Disc Pole Hole\\". The Disc Pole Hole created a standardized catching device that had a chain-hanger that held vertical hanging rows of chain out and away from a center pole. The vertical rows of chain came together forming a parabolic shape above and angling down towards a metal basket that attached to and surrounded the center pole, and could catch a disc from all directions. Ed and his company DGA revised and obtained patents for basket designs until his death in 2002. Today there are over 7000 disc golf courses installed throughout the world, the majority of them the Disc Pole Hole DGA baskets Headrick designed. = PDGA = In order to focus on creating the rules and standards for the sport and game as well as to create a self-sufficient dues- paying membership base, Headrick began the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA). Through the PDGA, Headrick and fellow disc golfers like Victor Malafronte worked to come up with the first rules and standards, which were printed out in small binders. Ed headed the PDGA until 1982 before turning the daily operation over to be run independently by an elected body of disc golf players. Headrick was PDGA member number 001 and today there are over 130,000 PDGA member numbers, with over 46,000 active paying dues members,. PDGA continues to be the overseeing body for the sport of disc golf, with an elected Board of Directors. In 2002, Headrick suffered two strokes while attending the Professional Disc Golf Association 2002 Amateur World Championships in Miami. He was able to get a medical flight back to his home in La Selva beach outside of Santa Cruz California, where he passed away soon afterward, on August 12, 2002, surrounded by his family and his friends. Ed's widow Farina Headrick took over running DGA when Headrick passed away. = ‚ÄúSteady‚Äù Ed Headrick: The Father of Disc Golf, The Modern Day Frisbee and Founder of DGA = * Inventor of the sport of Disc Golf * Inventor of the first disc golf basket, the Disc Pole Hole * Designed and Installed the first Disc Golf course * Inventor of the modern-day Frisbee * Founded: The International Frisbee Association (IFA) * Founded: Disc Golf Association (DGA) * Founded: Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) * Founded: Recreational Disc Golf Association (RDGA) * Established and organized the first World Frisbee Championships and the Junior World Frisbee Championships. * Established the first Disc Golf tournaments and a $50,000 landmark Frisbee Disc Golf Tournament in 1979. * Donated his trademark ‚ÄúDisc Golf‚Äù to the public domain and his life to the sport he loved Photo of some of Ed Headrick's Business Cards showing a snapshot of some of his work history up until his time working at Wham-O. = Ash Discs = As per Ed Headrick wishes, his ashes were incorporated into a limited number of discs.

The network was co-founded by Lockhart Steele and Ben Leventhal in 2005, and originally focused on dining and nightlife in New York City. Eater launched a national site in 2009, and covered nearly 20 cities by 2012. Vox Media acquired Eater, along with two others comprising the Curbed Network, in late 2013. In 2017, Eater had around 25 local sites in the United States, Canada, and England. The site has been recognized four times by the James Beard Foundation Awards. Description and history The food and dining site Eater is a brand of the digital media company Vox Media. It serves as a local restaurant guide, offering reviews as well as news about the restaurant industry. The property earns revenue via advertising, sometimes displaying content generated by Vox Creative. Eater was co-founded by Lockhart Steele and Ben Leventhal in July 2005, and initially focused on New York City's dining and nightlife scenes. The blog was one of three comprising the Curbed Network, founded by Steele in 2004, along with the real estate and fashion networks called Curbed and Racked, respectively. By 2007, Eater was receiving tens of thousands of readers per day. After expanding into Los Angeles and San Francisco, the network went national in 2009, and covered approximately 20 cities and one U.S. state (Maine) by mid 2012. Vox Media purchased the Curbed Network for approximately $30 million in November 2013. Traffic to Eater increased by 250 percent following the acquisition. In early 2014, Business Insider reported that Eater was generating approximately 2 million of Vox Media's 45 million unique monthly visitors, according to the analytics company comScore. The site began using Vox Media's content management system, Chorus, and producing more video content. Steele said he sold Eater partly to observe Chorus' influence on the site. The platform allows Eater to enhance map, journalistic, and visual features, and improves user engagement via forums. In mid 2017, Eater launched a London site, the network's first outside North America. Eater hosted 23 sites for cities in the United States and Canada at the time. Programming Eater produced a web series called Savvy, which featured chefs, restaurateurs, and sommeliers discussing dishes and cooking techniques. The program's second season aired in 2015. In 2017, Vox Media greenlit the series Cult Following and You Can Do This for Eater. Eater and PBS collaborated on a six-episode documentary television show about the cuisine of immigrant neighborhoods throughout the U.S., hosted by chef and restaurateur Marcus Samuelsson. The show, No Passport Required, marked Eater first television production project. Vox Entertainment produced the show, which premiered in July 2018. Vox Media executives Jim Bankoff and Marty Moe serve as two of several executive producers. In January 2018, Eater and SB Nation aired an online three-episode celebrity cooking competition series sponsored by PepsiCo. The show featured National Football League players Greg Jennings, Rashad Jennings, and Nick Mangold as competitors, as well as chefs Anne Burrell and Josh Capon. Leadership and editorial staff Eater was initially led by co-founders Leventhal and Steele, who had the titles \\"Head Eater\\" and CEO, respectively. Steele, who also served as president of the Curbed Network, ranked number 34 in The Daily Meal 2011 list of \\"America's 50 Most Powerful People in Food\\", for his role as a founder of Eater. In 2014, Amanda Kludt was named Eater first editor-in-chief, and Robert Sietsema was hired to be a New York-based food writer. Reception Food & Wine has called Eater \\"required reading\\". In 2006, the magazine included Steele and Leventhal in their \\"Tastemaker Awards\\" list, recognizing fifteen people who had significant impact on the food and wine industries by age 35, for their \\"ingenious\\" posts.

It is most commonly known as the greenhouse thrips, the glasshouse thrip or black tea thrips. This species of thrips was first described in 1833 by Bouch√© in Berlin, Germany. H. haemorrhoidalis also has many synonyms depending on where they were described from such as: H. adonidum Haliday, H. semiaureus Girault, H. abdominalis Reuter, H. angustior Priesner, H. ceylonicus Schultz, Dinurothrips rufiventris Girault. In New Zealand, H. haemorrhoidalis is one of the four species belonging to the subfamily Panchaetothripinae.  Description  = Physical appearance = Like other species in the family, Thripidae, they have the typical flattened bodies with wings that are narrow and pointed, and their ovipositors resembles a saw.  The Head  H. haemorrhoidalis have pale yellow 8-segmented antennae where the last segment narrows to look needle-like. H. haemorrhoidalis have what is described as a hypognathous head that is pointed backwards. The head of the greenhouse thrips is connected to the prothorax by an articular membrance and by cervical sclerites as well. The eyes of the greenhouse thrips are in the form of compound eyes and are made up of 65-70 facets and H. haemorrhoidalis have three ocelli. Another unique thing to the H. haemorrhoidalis is that they have asymmetrical mouthcones that contain an anteclypeus, labrum, labium, paired maxillary stylets and an unpaired left mandible that is well developed.  The Body  Adults have black thoraxes and yellow to dark brown abdomens, but at the ends of their abdomens, they have an orange coloured tip. Greenhouse thrips have a 10-segmented abdomen. The bodies of the H. haemorrhoidalis are covered with cuticles that have an average thickness of 7.5 micrometers. Their epidermis is made up of flattened cells and have a thickness of 3 micrometers. The forewings of the H. haemorrhoidalis are very narrow and contain few short setae on the veins. The legs of the greenhouse thrips have only a single- segmented tarsi. The body length of an adult H. haemorrhoidalis varies between 1.2-1.8 mm long as adults. The three pairs of legs on an adult is white in colour. H. haemorrhoidalis also have two salivary glands. One pair of the salivary gland is made up of long tubular glands that run parallel to and attached to the midgut by the midgut's basal lamina. This pair is composed of microvillate cells in the distal region and is cuticle-lined in the proximal region. The second pair of salivary glands is confined to the thorax and is made up of ovoid glands. This gland is said to produce a viscous type of secretion while the tubular gland is said to produce a watery type of secretion. The midgut of the H. haemorrhoidalis lacks muscles and the thing that is unique to them is that they have relatively low concentration of ganglia. = Reproductive System = H. haemorrhoidalis are parthenogenetic therefore, male greenhouse thrips are rare. Female H. haemorrhoidalis have reproductive systems that consists of two ovaries, two lateral oviducts and an accessory gland.The reproductive accessory gland of the H. haemorrhoidalis consists of an apical bulb and a fine gland duct. At the base of the ovipositor is a sebific gland.  Lifecycle  Just like other species of thrips, their lifecycle consists of egg development, two nymphal stages, a non-feeding propupal stage and pupal stage. A single thrips could produce up to seven generations when living in favourable temperate conditions and more than twelve generations when living in favourable tropical conditions. The average lifespan of a H. haemorrhoidalis is about a month. = Eggs = The female H. haemorrhoidalis lay eggs independently underneath the surface of leaves or on fruits. If there are areas that are exposed, the females would carry their eggs with secretions from the accessory gland and by faeces.The eggs will hatch to release larvae after 14-15 days if they are in environments that are 26-28‚ÑÉ and will hatch 16-22 days at 21-25‚ÑÉ. = Larvae = Larvae of the H. haemorrhoidalis are white in colour with red eyes. Some of the larvae tend to carry fecal droplets on the tips of their abdomen to act as a repellant against predators. They resemble a tinier version of an adult and lack wings. As the greenhouse thrips undergoes their instar stages, they start to darken in colour. After emergence, a female takes about 4-6 days to begin oviposition. They produce up to 47 eggs when the conditions are favourable.  Instar stages  The structure of the first instar larvae are similar to adults. Their body lengths are between 430-480 micrometers and their cuticles have about 1.1-2.5 micrometer of thickness. The internal structure of the first instar larvae is not that much different from an adult H. haemorrhoidalis. They only have two spiracles and their ganglia is more densely concentrated than in adults. The second instar larvae is about 1.1 mm in size and are yellowish-brown in colour with pale grey antennae. The first and second instar stage lasts from 9-16 days depending on the temperature of the area they inhabit. = Prepupal and Pupal = In this stage, the insect is non-feeding. Prepupal and pupal stage will last for 3-6 days depending on the temperature of the area they inhabit. The prepupal have a different appearance in comparison to an adult as they start to develop their wings. The pupa differs physically from the prepupal by the growth of the wings and the folding of the antennae over the insect's head. Prepupal and pupal stage will last for 3-6 days depending on the temperature of the area they inhabit.  Distribution  H. haemorrhoidalis is widely distributed in tropic and subtropic regions. It was speculated that this species was originally from a tropical area and have been introduced to other areas of the world. There is a table listing locations where H. haemorrhoidalis was found at CABI Invasive Species Compendium.  Relationship with humans  = Pest Status = H. haemorrhoidalis had gotten their common name of the greenhouse thrips due to the fact that they typically inhabit and are pests in greenhouses. They are polyphagous as they feed on a wide range of different fruits and ornamental plants. Ornamental plants that they infest are the azaleas, calla lilies, chrysanthemums, fuchsia, roses and orchids. They also are considered pests to ferns, palms and vines and vegetative plants as well. Some of the fruits that they were claim to have damaged were those including avocados, persimmons, and kiwis. Larvae and adult H. haemorrhoidalis feed by piercing the epidermal tissue of leaves and fruits and sucking out the cellular content. By feeding on the fruits they do not actually affect the quality of the fruit but rather it affects the cosmetics of the fruit which in turn affects the value of the fruit itself. The nymphs are able to produce a reddish fluid that are deposited on the surface of plants which allows for fungal growth to develop. H. haemorrhoidalis prefers feeding on mature foliage and the nitrogen levels of the foliage actually also plays a role in the thrips' preference. The leaves that have undergone attacks by the greenhouse thrips ended up with a lead-like to silvery colouring. = Pest Control = In the United States, specifically in southern California, H. haemorrhoidalis are considered major pests to avocado farms. But since the usage of the parasitoid, Thripobius semiluteus Boucek,as a form of biological control, the threat of H. haemorrhoidalis on avocados have reduced. Another way that avocado farms try to maintain the threat is to have modified fruit harvesting strategies to eliminate breeding and feeding sites of the thrips. Another usage of parasitoids was used in 2001 in New Zealand to control the greenhouse thrips. The parasitoid Thripobius javae is typically a predator of the H. haemorrhoidalis. H. haemorrhoidalis are also susceptible to phosphine and have been controlled with 2 hours of fumigation with 620 ppm phosphine. Other methods of microbial control have been used against the greenhouse thrips as well. Entomopathogens are a form of microbial insecticides that are used for thrips control. But despite being somewhat susceptible to fumigation and insecticides, it is said that H. haemorrhoidalis have great tendency to develop resistance to insecticides overall.  Predators  Naturally, H. haemorrhoidalis have two parasitoids, Megaphragma spp. and the Thripobius javae. Megaphragma attacks the eggs of H. haemorrhoidalis while T. javae attacks the larvae of H. haemorrhoidalis. It is said that when there is presence of the Thripobius javae in greenhouse plants, it is an indicator that there are H. haemorrhoidalis in the greenhouse. Although, one of the Megaphragma sp., Megaphragma mymaripenne, is not effective in treating greenhouse thrips despite a study showing that 50% of the H. haemorrhoidalis eggs showed parasite emergence holes when exposing the greenhouse thrips to that particular Megaphragma species. Other predators that prey on the H. haemorrhoidalis are the wasp species of Spilomena emarginata and S. nozela. These wasps attack adult and larval greenhouse thrips and paralyze them to feed to their own larvae.

American Women's War Relief Fund was an expatriate organization in the United Kingdom started by American women to fund and aid World War I support efforts. The group was made up of wealthy socialites, politicians' wives and humanitarians. Many famous and well-connected women were involved, including Lou Hoover, Consuelo Vanderbilt and Lady Randolph Churchill. Leila Paget served as president and Ava Lowle Willing was the fund's vice-president. The group, started almost immediately after the declaration of war, funded a fleet of ambulances, two hospitals, one field hospital and several employment opportunities for unemployed women in Britain.  History  American Women's War Relief Fund was founded on August 5, 1914. Members of the organization were women from the United States who were married to Englishmen and who wanted to help in the effort to support soldiers fighting in World War I. The president of the group was Leila Paget and Ava Lowle Willing served as vice- president. Many of the members of the group had husbands who were commanding troops during the war. Paget told journalist Hayden Church that she had thought up the idea for the Relief Fund merely three days after the start of the war. Winnaretta Singer and the Countess of Starfford were major donors of money to the fund. Paget also raised money in both America and England for wounded soldiers of several different countries fighting in the war. In 1917, there was an official request to have all American-led efforts to support the war in Europe be turned over to the American Red Cross for coordination purposes. In January 1918, the Relief Fund hospitals were fully turned over to be run by the Red Cross. The fund originally was going to sponsor an ambulance ship, but were persuaded to purchase 6 motor ambulances with a seventh added later by Grace Nichols and bearing the words, \\"From Friends in Boston\\". The ambulances had room enough for four stretchers and two medics.  Hospitals  The American Women's War Relief Hospital at Oldway in Paignton, Devon, 1914. In August 1914, the American Women's War Relief Fund received the donation from Paris Eugene Singer of his Oldway House in Paignton to be used as a military hospital. Lady Randolph Churchill was involved in persuading Singer to donate the house to use as a hospital. The building, known as the American Women's War Hospital, was initially equipped with 200 beds, an operating theatre, radiographic studio, pathology lab and also with anesthetizing and sterilization rooms. Later, an additional 20 beds were added, and an \\"Isolation Hut\\" for quarantines was built which could accommodate around 30 people. The American Red Cross helped staff the hospital, providing two units. The hospital began treating wounded soldiers as soon as September 1914. On November of that year, Queen Mary brought three hundred articles of clothes for the hospital and visited the wards. Anita Strawbridge solicited donations such as socks and underwear from the United States. By 1916, the American Women's War Hospital had treated 3,203 soldiers, according to the New York Herald. By March 1919, when the hospital closed, it had served over 7,000 soldiers. The relief fund also provided partial funding for a field hospital in Belgium run by the wife of an officer, Mrs. O'Gorman. Another hospital, known as the American Women's Hospital, was located at Lancaster Gate and had been opened in 1917 by Walter Hines Page and Willa Alice Wilson Page. The Lancaster hospital had 41 beds and was mainly staffed with American nurses. It was inspected by King George and the Queen in 1917. It closed in 1919.  Economic relief  In addition to setting up the hospital, the fund also created workrooms to teach young women new skills as part of the Economic Relief Committee of the American Women's War Relief Fund. The committee was headed by Consuelo Vanderbilt, who had been recruited by Lou Hoover in 1915. This committee provided funds to pay the women's wages and articles of clothing, such as socks, were sent to the hospital or \\"given to soldiers and sailors in special need.\\" A workroom was set up in a factory building near St. Pancras between August 1914 and August 1915. A knitting factory in Islington was opened in September 1914, followed by other workrooms in October at Woolwich and one at Greenwich. The Woolwich factory was given to a charity to run in 1915. The women employed at the workrooms were not given quotas, but instead did what they were able to do. The working women were also given free tea and low cost meals in the evening.

It was discovered on 24 January 1998, by astronomers with the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States.  Orbit and classification  is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population, and a member of the small group of Zhongguo asteroids, located in the Hecuba gap and locked in a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the gas giant Jupiter. Contrary to the nearby Griqua group, the orbits of the Zhongguos are stable over half a billion years. According to Milani and Kne≈æeviƒá, this asteroid is a core member of the unnamed asteroid family formed by the Zhongguo asteroid . It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.7‚Äì3.9 AU once every 6.02 years (2,199 days; semi-major axis of 3.31 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 1¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by Spacewatch in November 1996, or 14 months prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro.  Physical characteristics  has an absolute magnitude of 13.5. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve for this asteroid has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, measures 9.827 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.061, which is rather typical for the abundant carbonaceous C-type asteroids in the outer main-belt.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 13 September 2000, after its orbit had sufficiently been secured (). As of 2018, it has not been named.

Robin and Edward Robin. Joseph, a banker, was convicted of embezzlement in a New York City scandal that also involved Rabinovitch. She was indicted on a charge of perjury on June 10, 1911. _Joseph Robin \\"Skyrocket\\" Financier, On Trial Today_ , The Salina Daily Union, February 27, 1911, number 222, page 1 Rabinovitch swore her only known relatives were Joseph and Edward, denying her parents lived in the United States. However, an elderly man and woman claimed their parentage and testified in front of a jury. When the couple attempted to embrace the Rabinovitchs, the siblings denied they were their parents. _Robin's Sister in Cell for Perjury_ , Indianapolis Star, 10 Jan 1911, page 4. Joseph G.

There were only two trained nurses at the institution. The article revealed Rabinovitch was an advocate for better treatment for the mentally ill: \\"(the asylum offered) absolutely no treatment for the mental condition of the insane. Gynecology was not practiced in the female Asylum\\". Her testimony impacted the commissioners: > When she had concluded the autocratic Department of Charities and Correction > and the medical gentlemen of Ward's Island were dazed and panicky. President > Porter, who the day before had attempted to snap his fingers at the crusade > as he had done in the grand jury room and said he would not answer the > testimony had changed his attitude and had been to Mayor Gilroy pleading for > an assistant corporation counsel to defend the asylum.

Electricity experiments The focus of Rabinovitch's medical research was the use of electricity as an anesthetic, termed \\"electrical anesthesia\\". _A Machine That Produces the Effects of Alcohol Minus the Breath_ , The Sandusky Register 20th June 1920 page 17 A cable from Paris was reported in 1908, \\"The Paris authorities which will permit her to apply the system on a large scale in local insane asylums...

By 1910 her electrical experiments had progressed to human subjects. A newspaper headline proclaimed, \\"Device of woman doctor relieves man from pain while his toes are amputated at Hartford Hospital. Patient laughs during ordeal and does not feel knife.\\" The operation was performed at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford, CT to remove four frozen toes. The surgery was described: > When the man have been made ready for the operation straps were fastened > about his legs at points designated by Dr Rabinovitch. On these straps were > electrodes to which were attached wires connecting with a battery. The > electricity was turned on, and it numbed the legs below the knees much as > cocaine would.

Writing Rabinovitch edited the Journal of Mental Pathology which also published articles authored by her. In 1901 she wrote an article on what we would term today Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder: > Alcoholism of the parents is the major cause responsible for the birth of > idiot and imbecile children. Alcoholism not only causes idiocy and > imbecility of The offspring, but also acts as a strong factor in reducing > birth rate and increasing death rate.

She was 72 years old and her stated occupation was chemist. 1918 Ad for Woolf's Hypozone In 1937 Rabinovitch was involved in a lawsuit to gain a patent on Woolf's Hypozone, a chemical anticeptic.

It is partially responsible for the signing of the 1850 Robinson-Huron Treaty.  Historical background  The Mica Bay Incident occurred immediately prior to the signing of the Robinson-Huron Treaty. The political tensions leading up to it reflect ongoing Indigenous concerns around land rights, mineral extraction, and corporate/crown encroachment on traditional territories.  Incident  In 1849 a group of First Nations and M√©tis people were displeased with ongoing mineral extraction by local mining companies. This mining was occurring outside of a negotiated treaty and contrary to the 1763 Royal Proclamation's statements on Indigenous land and resource rights. In November 1849 a group traveled from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario to Mica Bay on the shore of Lake Superior. Upon arrival at Mica Bay the group attacked copper mining sites established by the Quebec Mining Company, with the goal of forcing the Company off the land. Over 100 soldiers were sent to put down the incident and in December a number of the leaders were arrested and detained in Toronto. Leaders of the incident included Chief Shingawukonse (Garden River First Nation), Chief Nebenaigoching (Batchewana First Nation), Chief Oshawana, Allan Macdonell, Metcalfe, and others. The Mica Bay incident is known as the tipping point which forced the government to negotiate treaty agreements with Indigenous communities in the Lake Huron and Lake Superior region.

Looser was President of Walter Rentsch Holding AG and ELCO Looser Holding AG. Today Looser is active as a member of the board of the Hubert Looser Foundation.  Life  Looser was the sixth born of seven children in 1938 in the Swiss town of Vilters, where he also grew up and attended school. His parents were entrepreneurs and had built the company ELCO. After Looser had earned his MBA from Columbia University New York, he joined his parents company in 1964 and was responsible for the establishment and leadership of the ELCO Group in France, Belgium and Luxembourg until 1980. During this time, the founding of Remaco AG for business mediation and the takeover of Walter Rentsch AG in the field of office technology took place. In 1973, Looser took over the management of Walter Rentsch AG with 120 employees, which at his resignation in 1992, consisted of 1,200 employees. 1990/92 Looser resigned as president of the corporate groups Walter Rentsch AG and ELCO Looser Holding AG. After selling his company shares, Hubert Looser became increasingly involved in the Fondation Hubert Looser, which he co-founded in 1988 and in which he still serves as president and financially supports his fortune with around 40 worldwide aid projects. Among other things, came the realization of projects for people with disabilities and children in need, as well as training support for young people in countries such as Cambodia, Albania and Romania or AIDS projects in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. Looser is married with Ursula Looser Stingelin, a father of two children from a previous marriage and lives in Zurich.  Art collection  During his stay in Paris in 1957 in order to learn the language, posters from an Impressionist exhibition made a big impression on him and he went to museums around the world whenever he had the time. In his twenties, Looser completed various study trips during his training period to Mexico, Japan, Paris, London or New York and laid the foundation of his passion for collecting art. However, his collections first 200 works were mostly Swiss art. Today, Hubert Looser, is considered to be an outstanding private art collector in the Swiss area. His collections main focus is on works of surrealism, Abstract expressionism and minimalism. One of Willem de Kooning's largest collections outside of the US is as part of the collection. The museum-suitable works of the collection were introduced in 2008 to the Fondation Hubert Looser, which makes this cultural asset available to the public as a permanent exhibition at the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich.

It is native to the tropical Indo-Pacific region. Description This starfish has a wide variety of colour forms but tends to be cryptic. It is typically symmetrically patterned with distinctive spots, some running laterally around the starfish's margin and others in rows which run down the five arms. In one colour morph, the spots on disc and arms were dark purple and those near the tips of the arms were reddish. The tip of each arm curls upwards, and the tube feet near the tip seem to have a chemosensory function. Distribution Neoferdina cumingi is native to shallow water reefs in the tropical Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, through northwestern and northeastern Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, to the Central Pacific. Ecology Although the feeding habits of this starfish have not been studied, it is part of the order Valvatida, and starfish in this order typically evert their stomach to engulf and digest their food before retracting the stomach back into the disc, bringing the partially digested prey with it. Like other starfish, this species is likely to be able to reproduce asexually after splitting apart, with even pieces as small as one fifth of the original volume being able to regenerate as long as the madreporite is present. Some members of Valvatida are hermaphrodites and others have separate sexes. In Neoferdina cumingi gametes are dispersed from the gonopore, which may be on the aboral (upper) surface or on the oral (under) surface of the animal. Two types of brachiolaria larvae appear to exist; some develop from yolky eggs and are non- swimming and non-feeding, while others have cilia and can swim, but do not feed. The larvae are planktonic and drift with the currents for about four weeks before they need to find shallow water areas in which to settle, often at a considerable distance from their origins.

Much of Ariadne's charitable work stems from her personal history; both of her children, Natalia (Nats) and August are gay, and much of Ariadne's philanthropic efforts go towards working with the LGBTQ community. Getty serves with Queen Rania of Jordan, Muhammad Yunus, Kofi Annan, and Ted Turner as an inaugural board member of the Better World Fund, a nonprofit that provides educational and advocacy support for the United Nations and causes regarding refugees and gender inequality. Through her work with Better World Fund, Getty has traveled to Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to visit refugee camps with stakeholders to provide better living conditions for refugees. In September 2018, GLAAD presented the inaugural Ariadne Getty Ally Award to Alyssa Milano at its 49th anniversary gala in San Francisco; the Los Angeles LGBT Center honored Getty with the Rand Schrader Distinguished Scholar Vanguard Award; and she became a board member of the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles. In August 2019, Variety named her the 2019 Philanthropist of the Year.  Ariadne Getty Foundation  Getty founded the Fuserna Foundation in 2004, which she later remained the Ariadne Getty Foundation. She currently serves as its president and executive director. The foundation is a major donor to the Los Angeles LGBT Center. In October 2017 it held a benefit concert that raised over $100,000 to help prevent bullying of LGBTQ youth. At the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos Getty announced that her foundation would be giving $15 million to GLAAD to reverse the erosion of LGBTQ acceptance and help move the global LGBTQ community forward. A survey by the Harris Poll and GLAAD reported that LGBTQ acceptance in the United States had declined for the first time since the poll was first conducted. In 2018 Getty fulfilled her promise, donating $15 million for the GLAAD Media Institute, which seeks to spread LGBTQ acceptance by training journalists and people in the Hollywood film and television industries how to advocate for and tell the stories of LGBTQ people. The Ariadne Getty Foundation and GLAAD partnered in hosting the panel Progress in Peril: How Business, Philanthropy and Media Can Lead to Achieving 100% Acceptance for LGBTQ People at the World Economic Forum.  Personal life  Getty married Justin Williams, an actor, and had two children; fashion designer August Williams and fashion model Natalia Williams, who are both gay. She has said that her children inspired her passion for LGBTQ rights activism and philanthropy. She and Williams later divorced.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4y6AP_425Q She is in a long-term relationship with producer Louie Rubio. = Brother's kidnapping = Getty criticized the 2017 action crime comedy film All the Money in the World, which focused on the 1973 kidnapping of her brother John Paul Getty III when he was sixteen years old, saying the film incorrectly depicted her family as obsessed with wealth. She also defended her grandfather, J. Paul Getty, saying that her grandfather was a loving and involved person in her life and did not behave as the film portrayed him. In 2018 Getty threatened to take legal action against FX for their series Trust, which retells the story of her brother's 1973 kidnapping, saying that the series defames her family for implying they were complicit in the kidnapping.  Popular culture  Getty is portrayed by Lucy Gentili in the 2018 American anthology drama television series Trust.
