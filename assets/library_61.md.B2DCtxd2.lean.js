It has since spread rapidly around the world, with major competitions held worldwide.  History in the United Kingdom  The first widely documented appearance of dog agility was as entertainment at the Crufts dog show in 1978. John Varley, a committee member from the 1977 show, was tasked with coming up with entertainment for the audience between the obedience and conformation competitions in the main ring. Varley asked dog trainer Peter Meanwell for assistance, and they presented a largely jumping- style course resembling something from the equestrian world to demonstrate dogs' natural speed and agility. Many obstacles recognisable to modern handlers were already present at that demonstration, including the 'Over & Under' (A-frame/tunnel combination), 'Tyre Hoop' (tire), 'Weaving Flags' (weave poles), 'Canvas Tunnel' (collapsed tunnel) and 'Cat Walk' (dogwalk). It was reported in Our Dogs newspaper that in 1974 Meanwell had either been a witness to or participated in such a competition at an agricultural fair, thus predating more widely published accounts for the start of dog agility. By some oral accounts, there was an earlier demo with similar intent using playground articles such as a seesaw (or teeter-totter) and a tunnel, although this has not been documented. Another account attributes the obstacles used in displays by the Royal Air Force Police Dog Demonstration Team as seen at various country wide exhibitions of the time as obstacles were used in the day to day training of RAF Police Dogs. At the 1978 Crufts, the demonstration immediately intrigued dog owners because of its speed and challenge and the dexterity displayed by the dogs. People wanted to see more, and indeed wanted their own dogs to be able to participate. The demonstration was so popular that it went on to grow into local, then national, and eventually international, competitions with standardized equipment. By 1979, several British dog training clubs were offering training in the new sport of dog agility, and that December the first Agility Stakes competition was held at the International Horse Show at Olympia in London. In 1980, The Kennel Club became the first organization to recognize agility as an official sport with a sanctioned set of rules, and the first agility test to be held under the new regulations was the team event at Crufts that year. The event was judged by Peter Meanwell, with Peter Lewis as his scribe. Peter Lewis and John Gilbert (one of the few original 1978 competitors who continues to participate in agility competition, training, and judging) went on to play a major part in spreading the sport of dog agility across Europe and around the world. 1983 saw the founding of the Agility Club, the first national agility club in the UK publishing the Agility Voice, the first agility magazine. During the early years, smaller dogs were not well catered for in the UK, with all having to compete over the same 30\\" jump height with the large dogs. This started to change during the early eighties with classes being introduced for Mini dogs (up to 15\\" at the shoulder, jumping 15\\"). The first Mini Agility Dog of the Year competition took place at Olympia in December 1987. Classes for Midi dogs (15-17\\" at the shoulder, jumping 20\\") were introduced in the Nineties, though it was not until 2005 that they too had their own competition at Olympia. In 1992, the first weeklong agility show (Dogs in Need, in aid of dog charities) was held at Malvern in England, with a total of 885 dogs entered and 5,879 class entries. Dogs in Need is now one of several weeklong Kennel Club agility shows to take place each year, part of a busy calendar of day and weekend shows. Dog agility has grown in the UK to the point where the most popular Kennel Club shows regularly run ten or more rings a day, with up to 450 runs in each ring (or more if two judges are used in each ring). Throughout the Nineties, dog agility in the United Kingdom was dominated by the Kennel Club, with KC shows the only ones that were widely publicised. This situation finally started to change in 2003 with the appearance of shows run by East Midlands Dog Agility Club (EMDAC). The Kennel Club initially attempted to defend its monopoly, before finally accepting that clubs and organisations outside its jurisdiction should also have the right to put on agility shows without any fear of disciplinary action against members or competitors from the Kennel Club. This decision led to an explosion in the number of non-KC agility shows from late 2003 onwards. Many of these were (and still are) held by independent clubs as one-off events, but a small number of distinct agility organisations have also started to emerge. These include UK Agility, Agility Addicts and It Barks, all of which were founded in 2004. In 2006, EMDAC launched the British Agility Association (BAA). In addition to providing agility competitors with a wider range of choices in the type of show they wish to attend, these shows have acted as a catalyst in encouraging the Kennel Club to review its own agility rules and attitude towards the sport.  History in Canada  In Canada dog agility was introduced in 1988 by Art Newman from North Gower, Ontario when the Agility Dog Association of Canada (ADAC) was formed. The ADAC is now known as the Agility Association of Canada (AAC), which is currently a major trial sanctioning body across Canada. The first agility club was also founded in North Gower, Ontario, Canada; the All Dog Sports Club.  History in the United States  In the United States, several people experimented with dog agility based generally on the British rules. The first exhibitions took place in the early 1980s. The pivotal founding groups were the NDCA and the USDAA. Today, the NDCA has merged with the United Kennel Club leaving the USDAA as the dominant force in the U.S. world of agility. =NDCA and UKC agility merger= In 1984, using information from articles describing English agility, Charles (Bud) Kramer began developing the idea that became the National Committee for Dog Agility (NCDA). He built and experimented with equipment through the winter of 1984/1985. He published a series of articles describing his ideas for Front and Finish magazine, which eventually were published as a book, Agility Dog Training for All Breeds, in 1987. In 1987, Kramer founded the NCDA in Manhattan, Kansas with the goal of convincing the AKC to recognize agility as a sport. Kramer's agility was briefly affiliated with AKC agility in the early 1990s, but became separate under a new name, National Club for Dog Agility, in 1991. In August 1994, NDCA merged with the United Kennel Club, and agility under Kramer's rules has been performed under UKC auspices since then. UKC agility has evolved into a different kind of sport than that provided by AKC, USDAA, and international agility organizations, involving more control of the dog over complicated obstacles rather than speed and accuracy over basic obstacles. =USDAA's influence= In 1985, Kenneth Tatsch collaborated with his local obedience club and others, and began putting on all-breed exhibitions in Garland, Texas. A year later, he founded the United States Dog Agility Association (http://www.usdaa.com/) and incorporated in January 1987 in Texas. To promote the sport, USDAA secured Pedigree Dog Food (formerly Kal Kan Dog Food, a sister company to Chum Dog Food, the guiding sponsor in the UK) as a sponsor, and the first national championship tournament series in North America  the Grand Prix of Dog Agility  was introduced in 1988 at the Astro World Series of Dog Shows in Houston, Texas. Until 1990, USDAA agility competitions were only for placement ribbons, but at that time the USDAA began offering agility titles, for which the dog had to perform to certain standards in several competitions to earn scores towards the various titles. At first, the only titles offered were the Agility Dog (AD), or starters-level title; the AAD Advanced Agility Dog (AAD), or intermediate-level title, and the Master Agility Dog (MAD), or expert-level title. This increased the appeal for all dog owners; one's dog did not have to be a superstar to succeed at agility, but could simply be good enough and fast enough to meet the requirements to earn title points. USDAA's vision was far broader than a single class, and in 1994, USDAA introduced an expansive titling program to incorporate title recognition in each of four nonstandard classes (those other than the basic form)  gamblers choice, jumping, snooker agility, and relay. In 1988, almost no one had heard of dog agility in the United States, while meanwhile in England it had become an extremely popular sport, drawing hundreds of spectators. By 1989, however, when the USDAA Grand Prix of Dog Agility was first filmed for TV, nearly 2000 spectators attended the final round. Just a year later, attendance neared 4000. The event's popularity sparked interest around the country, and in 1989, Tatsch expanded the tournament to include local qualifying events, hosted by groups formed by competitors in attendance at the Grand Prix the prior year in Texas. The tournament grew rapidly, jumping from 8 events in 1989 to more than 150 local and regional championship events in 2004, in five countries, leading to a World Championship event. Tatsch also named his first Advisory Board composed of experienced trainers and agility enthusiasts from different parts of the country, who began working on a set of regulations for titling programs that were adopted in May 1990. Meanwhile, the agility equipment used by the USDAA mirrored its British counterparts, as did the basic rules for the standard agility course. USDAA also introduced Jumpers Classes and other nonstandard classes from Great Britain, such as Gamblers and Snooker, which encourage handlers to design their own courses under strict sets of rules established by the judge on the day of competition, and the Relay, which pairs up two dogs and two handlers to take on a course resembling the standard agility course. =ASCA and NADAC= Meanwhile, in the early 1990s, the Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA) decided to provide its own sanctioning rules for agility. In July 1991, Sandra Katzen became the agility chairperson to pursue this project. Initially, ASCA considered mirroring USDAA's rules; however, because each individual ASCA club would have had to become a member of USDAA, ASCA decided against this proposal. In 1992, ASCA began working with Sharon Nelson of Idaho, who had been a member of the first US team in international agility competition, to develop a program based on the international programs. Jacqueline Taylor and Sally Sheridan, among others, contributed heavily to the program. In 1993, ASCA began considering the proposal for ratification, but the process stalled. As a result, Sharon Nelson formed her own agility organization in 1993, the North American Dog Agility Council (NADAC) using the rules developed for ASCA. In 1994, ASCA approved using the same set of rules in lockstep with NADAC, so that competitors could earn either ASCA or NADAC titles, or both, at dual-sanctioned events, starting in January, 1995. At that time, NADAC and USDAA used the same equipment and had similar rules for the standard numbered and jumpers courses; NADAC also included the Gamblers event in its rulebook. However, over time, NADAC moved away from the International standards, focusing on its own vision of a faster and much safer agility environment. It has gradually eliminated or changed many of the obstacles so that its equipment specifications and many of its rules no longer match those of the USDAA, AKC, or FCI. As of May 31, 2006, ASCA and NADAC no longer dual sanction trials, and the ASCA agility program has returned to an older set of rules that more closely match those of the rest of the agility community. =AKC= Bud Kramer's NCDA provided an early influence on, and was briefly affiliated with, AKC before AKC developed its own rules. The AKC, which for decades had sanctioned conformation shows, obedience trials, and other dog sports, showed a growing interest in agility over a period of several years. The AKC's first agility advisory committee met in August 1993 and started the process of creating its own agility rules and standards. When the AKC entered the field, each competition had only one standard course. The first AKC sanctioned agility match was held in 1994, at the Houston Kennel Club show held at the Astroarena in Houston, Texas. Sanctioning by the AKC made the rapidly growing sport nearly explode in the United States, as AKC handlers began exploring USDAA and NADAC competitions as ways to expand their agility experience. A few years later, AKC introduced its own version of the Jumpers course, which included weave poles as did the International rules but which NADAC and USDAA did not include. =UKI= In 2010, UKI (UK Agility International) was started in the US as a sister organization to UK Agility in the UK. This organization sends world team members each year to the WAO (World Agility Open) as well as hosts competitions catering to exhibitors. UKI's motto involves agility \\"by competitors, for competitors\\" and gains popularity each year. Like USDAA's and AKC's beginnings, UKI's first trial was also held in Texas. =Additional organizations= Bob and Marliu Basin created the American Agility Associates in Colorado. This organization didn't last much beyond the early 1990s. When the FCI introduced its international agility championships, it continued its affiliation with purebred kennel clubs around the world, including the AKC, allowing the AKC to choose a team from among its registered competitors. As a result, many top-level American dogs without AKC registration were shut out of international competition. To compensate, two additional organizations  the International Agility Link (organized through email) and the World Dog Show  sponsored international competitions starting around 1996 that allowed any competing dogs to be part of their country's teams; the World Dog Show affiliated with the USDAA, while the IAL remained independent. The World Dog Show hosted a couple of international championships but financially could not continue, so the USDAA began pursuing its own affiliations with other organizations and clubs worldwide to start its own International Championships. In 2001, the Grand Prix of Dog Agility, previously national in scope reached beyond North American boundaries and became a truly international event, hosting teams from several countries on other continents. In 1998, Canine Performance Events (CPE) was founded by Linda Eickholdt, who took suggestions from other exhibitors, judges and host clubs, and created an organization with more common and new unique games classes as well as the standard agility course. Jump heights do not exceed a dog's measured height, although an owner may enter a higher height if they wish to. CPE agility continues to grow in the United States. Bud Houston founded the Teacup Dog Agility Association (TDAA) for small dogs. The purpose of the TDAA is to provide challenges similar to that experienced by larger dogs in other venues. Obstacles are placed closer together and obstacle sizes are miniaturized to accommodate smaller dogs. =Continuing changes= The sport of agility continues to grow and change in the United States. Every year brings the addition of new clubs and new classes. The rules for each organization go through periodic review as well, requiring that competitors in each organization keep up with the current rules, regulations, and class offerings.

He was released from captivity on 4 March 1973, after 6 years of confinement.  Background  McDaniel was born in September 1931 to Willard and Helen McDaniel, poor tobacco sharecroppers in North Carolina. He was the eldest of eight children. In High School, he was heavily involved in athletics and played basketball and baseball. He had an offer to play baseball professionally, but his father insisted that McDaniel attend college, having only finished 4th grade himself. McDaniel attended Campbell Junior College in Buies Creek, North Carolina on an athletic scholarship. He met his wife Dorothy Howard, the daughter of a Baptist minister, at Campbell and married her six years later. Following Campbell, McDaniel attended Elon College in Elon, North Carolina and enlisted in the Navy. He became interested in aviation since he felt it complemented his athletic mindset. He attended flight school in Corpus Christi, Texas then moved to Virginia Beach, Virginia. He had three children with Dorothy prior to his capture in Vietnam, Mike, David and Leslie.  Navy career  McDaniel began US Navy active duty 15 March 1955 and was designated a Naval Aviator 1 October 1956 after completing training. From 1956 to 1960, he was a Special Weapons Delivery Instructor with VA-25 and VA-65, which was equipped with the Douglas A-1 Skyraider at the time. From 1961 to 1963, he was a Replacement Air Group (RAG) Flight Instructor with VA-42. From 1963 to 1965, McDaniel was with as an assistant Carrier Air Traffic Control (CATC) after completing training for Air Intercept Controller (AIC) / Carrier Controlled Approach (CCA) in Glynco, Georgia. McDaniel deployed on a combat tour to Vietnam as Maintenance Officer with VA-35 aboard starting in November 1966. He flew 81 combat missions up to May 1967. McDaniel was shot down while flying an A-6A Intruder aircraft (buno 152594) on 19 May 1967 during an Alpha strike on VƒÉn ƒêi·ªÉn, south of Hanoi, in North Vietnam during Operation Rolling Thunder. He was listed as \\"missing in action\\" until the Hanoi government acknowledged that he was being held prisoner in 1970. His bombardier-navigator, James Kelly Patterson, also ejected from the A-6, but as of 2014, it was presumed that Patterson was captured and died at some point later. McDaniel was tortured while in captivity during the Vietnam War. The most severe torture resulted from his active role in camp communications during an organized escape attempt by his fellow prisoners in June 1969. During that time McDaniel was detained in isolation for more than two weeks, severely beaten, bound with ropes resulting in a compound fracture of his arm, deprived of sleep and subjected to electrical shock. Even though he was not directly involved in planning the escape attempt, he refused to give his torturers the names of the organizers and accepted responsibility for the attempt himself. He is the author of Scars and Stripes, a book telling about his six years of captivity in North Vietnam, with much of it in H·ªèa L√≤ Prison, known as the Hanoi Hilton. He was released from captivity on 4 March 1973, after 6 years of captivity and spent much of 1973 attached to Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Portsmouth, Virginia. When McDaniel returned home from Vietnam, he was awarded the Navy's second highest award for bravery, the Navy Cross. Among his other military decorations are two Silver Stars, the Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\", the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Bronze Stars with Combat \\"V\\", and two Purple Hearts for wounds received while in captivity. Captain McDaniel resumed active duty and served as Commanding Officer of from 21 June 1975 to 10 September 1976 and Commanding Officer of the aircraft carrier from 25 May 1977 to 30 November 1978. Under his command, Lexington experienced no serious accidents while accomplishing more than 20,000 carrier landings. While Captain McDaniel was commander of the Lexington, Gerard Biancohttp://www.gerardbianco.com/ was commissioned by the Navy to go aboard and paint the most exciting thing he found. The portrait hangs in the National Museum of the United States Navy in Washington, D.C. McDaniel served as Director of Navy/Marine Corps Liaison to the United States House of Representatives from 1979 to 1981. In this capacity, Captain McDaniel worked daily with Congress on national defense planning and provided legislators with information vital to the strategic development of Navy forces throughout the world. He retired from the Navy 6 January 1982.  Post-Navy Career  McDaniel subsequently became involved in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, leading to a \\"grassroots campaign to focus attention on American servicemen still missing in Southeast Asia.\\" In 1982, McDaniel ran on the Republican ticket against Democrat incumbent Charles Orville Whitley to represent North Carolina's 3rd congressional district. McDaniel was defeated 63% to 36% in that election. In 1988, McDaniel went on a speaking tour of US Navy commands to encourage military personnel to register to vote and discussing his experiences as a POW. McDaniel was President of the American Defense Institute, a non-profit organization headquartered in Washington, D.C.

He succeeded to the title of 4th Baron Swaythling in 1990 on the death of his father, Stuart Albert Samuel Montagu, 3rd Baron Swaythling OBE. His photographic portrait by Godfrey Argent was commissioned for the National Photographic Record in 1969, and is held at the National Portrait Gallery. He appears in two other photographs (taken in 1928 and in 1948) in the archives of the National Portrait Gallery.http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp84101/david-charles- samuel-montagu-4th-baron-swaythling?search=sas&sText;=Swaythling Background and early life David was the son of Stuart Montagu, 3rd Baron Swaythling, and Mary Violet Levy. His parents divorced in 1942 when he was 13, and David lived with his mother and her second husband. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a degree in English Literature. Business career David Montagu held prominent positions in several notable British companies. He became chairman of his family's banking firm, Samuel Montagu & Co., in 1970 aged 41, having become a director of the firm in 1954 aged 26. In 1973, the firm was bought out by the Midland Bank, and David declined the offer of the post of non-executive chairman. He was chairman and chief executive of Orion Bank from 1974 to 1979, director of J. Rothschild Holdings from 1983 to 1989, and chairman of Rothmans International plc from 1988 until his death. In 1990 he became a member of the Board of Banking Supervision of the Bank of England, a position which he held until 1996. He was also a founding director of London Weekend Television for 21 years and a director of The Daily Telegraph between 1985 and 1996. Political career As a peer, he took his seat in the House of Lords, but rarely attended, making his maiden speech on 5 June 1990, when he spoke strongly in support of the War Crimes Bill which would have permitted British courts to prosecute alleged Nazi war criminals living in Britain. His speech included the words: ‚ÄúThe Jewish faith is centered on the idea of justice, not revenge. Those who believe that an eye-for-an-eye means revenge have no knowledge or understanding of the basic tenets of Judaism. The phrase means only that justice demands equal treatment.\\" He suggested that trials of alleged war criminals would help to keep alive the awareness of the horrors of the past.http://www.jta.org/1990/06/06/archive/house-of-lords-defeats-british-war- crimes-bill The Act was rejected by the House of Lords, but the Parliament Acts were invoked and so it became law in 1991 as the War Crimes Act.

The Winchester Model 1895 is an American lever-action repeating firearm developed and manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company in the late 19th century, chambered for a number of full-size military and hunting cartridges such as 7.62√ó54mmR, .303 British, .30-03, .30 Army, .30-06, .35 Winchester, .38-72 Winchester, .40-72 Winchester and .405 Winchester. Design The first Model 1895 was the first Winchester rifle to feature a box magazine that is located underneath the action instead of the tubular magazine design, which had remained fundamentally unchanged from the Winchester 1866. This allowed the rifle to safely chamber military and hunting cartridges with spitzer (pointed) bullets. The M1895 was also the last of the lever-action rifles to be designed by John Browning, and featured a rear locking bolt as in his previous designs dating back to the Winchester 1886. The M1895 is the strongest lever-action rifle Winchester has produced, designed to handle the increased pressures generated by the more powerful smokeless powder cartridges entering common use at the time of its introduction. By today's standards however, the design is considered relatively weak, and not suited to high pressure loads. Around serial number 5000, a new receiver profile was introduced which had fluted (scalloped) sides, as opposed to the original flat sided design. This new receiver reduced the weight of the rifle by a small amount, and increased the width by 1/16 of an inch. By serial number 6000, it is thought that the last of the flat sided M1895s left the factory. These early rifles are now exceedingly rare. Military Between 1915 and 1917 approximately 33,000 M1895's were manufactured for the airforce and police units of the Russian Empire, accounting for about 70% of total production of the rifles prior to 1936 when the M1895 was discontinued. Chambered in 7.62√ó54mmR, these versions were unusual for a lever-action rifle in that they also had a charger guide, allowing the M1895 rifle to be reloaded by the same charger clips used in the Mosin‚ÄìNagant bolt-action rifle. Rifles made for the Russian contract had a longer than standard barrel fitted with an extended forestock and bayonet lug.James, Garry \\"Winchester Model 1895 Russian Musket\\" American Rifleman April 2013 p.112 Initial delivery of the rifles was delayed because adaptation to Russian standards, particularly the charger guide, proved more difficult than expected. Additional delays resulted from incompetent and obstructive Russian inspectors, who refused to use Winchester-made test gauges despite no Russian gauges existing, insisted that test ammunition be shipped from Russia (instead of using readily available Winchester ammunition made on Russian contract), and often rejected rifles for irrelevant flaws such as wood grain in the stock being insufficiently straight. Winchester later sold these rejected rifles on the US commercial market. Russia issued many of their Winchester Model 1895 rifles to troops from Finland and the Baltic states, especially the Latvian Riflemen. At least 9,000 Model 1895 rifles are known to have been provided by the Soviet Union in 1936 to the Spanish Republicans for use in the Spanish Civil War. Other nations adopted the rifle in more limited numbers. The United States ordered 10,000 in caliber .30/40 Krag for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, but the war ended before they arrived at the front. These rifles were marked \\"U.S.\\" atop the receiver ring and fitted with stock furniture similar to the M1895 Lee Navy including the short knife-type bayonet. Many parts were marked \\"K.S.M.\\" by ordnance inspector Kelly S. Morse. One hundred of these rifles were issued to the 33rd Volunteer Infantry for field testing in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. The report of testing completed on 25 December 1899 stated the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen was greatly superior for military service. The remaining 9,900 rifles were sold to M. Harley Company and most were shipped to Cuba in 1906.Canfield, Bruce N. 19th Century Military Winchesters March 2001 American Rifleman pp.41&77 Some of these rifles found their way to Mexico, where they were favored by Pancho Villa‚Äôs troops during the Mexican Revolution. Theodore Roosevelt also personally purchased an M1895 Winchester in .30 Army (.30-40 Krag) during the same timeframe. The Model 1895 in .30 Army was also entered into an 1896 New York National Guard rifle contract competition, but finished second to the Savage Model 1895 due to the Winchester rifle lacking a magazine cutoff and magazine counter. Winchester strongly disputed the results of the contest, arguing that the competition had been rigged in Savage's favor, and the ensuing political controversy led to the cancellation of the contract. Civilian As with previous Winchester rifles, a new serial number range was launched with the M1895, beginning with serial number 1.Wilson, R. L. \\"The Model 1895 Lever-Action.\\" Winchester: An American Legend: the Official History of Winchester Firearms and Ammunition from 1849 to the Present. New York: Random House, 1992. 104‚Äì09. Print. Including military contract rifles, a total of 425,881 rifles were produced, with production ceasing at serial number 425,132. The standard barrel length varied from 24 to 28 inches, depending on chambering and configuration, and the Standard finish on all rifles was blue. The rifle is most commonly associated today with former President Theodore Roosevelt; however, it was also used by many other famed hunters and adventurers, to include Martin and Osa Johnson, Charles Cottar, and author Stewart Edward White. Garrit Forbes‚Äîhunting companion of W. D. M. Bell, first cousin of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and long time personal friend of gun writer and firearms enthusiast Elmer Keith‚Äîrecommended the M1895 in .405 Winchester to Theodore Roosevelt.Keith, Elmer M. \\"Elephant & Cape Buffalo Rifles.\\" Guns & Ammo Apr. 1976 Theodore Roosevelt took two M1895 rifles with him on his 1909 safari to East Africa, both in .405 Winchester. Additionally, Kermit Roosevelt accompanied his father on the trip and brought two more M1895 rifles; one was chambered in .405 Winchester, and the other in .30-03 Springfield. While the serial number of Kermit's .30-03 has been lost, the serial numbers of the three .405 rifles are known to have been 63727, 63736, and 68180.Wilson, Robert Lawrence, and Theodore Roosevelt. \\"Theodore Roosevelt and the Winchester Arms Company.\\" Theodore Roosevelt, Outdoorsman. Agoura, CA: Trophy Room, 1994. 239‚Äì72. Print. Theodore Roosevelt praised the .405 M1895 in his book African Game Trails, famously referring to this rifle as his \\"'medicine gun' for lions\\": :But as we stood, one of the porters behind called out \\"Simba\\"; and we caught a glimpse of a big lioness galloping down beside the trees, just beyond the donga ‚Ä¶ Tarlton took his big double-barrel and advised me to take mine, as the sun had just set and it was likely to be close work; but I shook my head, for the Winchester 405 is, at least for me personally, the \\"medicine gun\\" for lions.Roosevelt, Theodore. \\"Trekking Through the Thirst to the Sotik.\\" African Game Trails. New York: Charles Schribner's Sons, 1910. 166‚Äì67. Print. Although it is often said that Roosevelt called the .405 M1895 his \\"big medicine,\\" this phrase is never used in African Game Trails, and is possibly the erroneous combination of his \\"medicine gun\\" quote with his \\"big stick\\" speech of 1901. Kenneth Anderson, who was a writer and hunter, used his .405 winchester during his shooting expeditions. The Model 1895 in both its rifle and carbine configuration was popular with the Texas Rangers and Arizona Rangers in both the 30-40 Krag and 30-06 Springfield calibers. In 1985, the Browning Arms Company reintroduced the M1895 rifle in .30-06 Springfield.\\"What Is the Historical Timeline for Browning?\\" Browning North America's Official Web Site  Firearms  Rifles  Over and Under Shotguns  Guns. Web. 15 Feb. 2011. . Later in 2001, Winchester reintroduced the rifle during the 100 year anniversary of Theodore Roosevelt's presidential administration, offering it again in .405 Winchester, as well as .30-06 Springfield and .30-40 Krag since its reintroduction. In 2008 Winchester produced a pair of Theodore Roosevelt commemorative rifles. In 2009 an additional pair of rifles was offered commemorating Roosevelt's African Safari in 1909 after leaving office. Both the Browning and new Winchester rifles are made in Japan by Miroku. The Winchesters, however, differ from the original design in that they feature rebounding hammers and a tang safety. Their triggers are also shaped differently in that they cannot be fitted into an original rifle.

Dog agility is now an international dog sport with many different sanctioning organizations and competitions worldwide.  Agility in the United Kingdom  A Kollie taking part in an agility competition. = Eligibility for competition = Dogs of all sizes and origins are eligible to compete at agility shows in the UK, provided that they are: *Registered with the show's organising body, where required *A minimum of 18 months of age (16 months in UKA nursery classes) *Not a bitch in season *Not suffering from any infectious or contagious disease *Not of such a temperament as to be a danger to the safety of any person or other animal *Not in a physical condition that would cause suffering when competing = Kennel Club shows = Brittany dog taking part in an agility competition. A New Zealand red and white border collie competing in an ANKC agility competition. Golden Retriever on the A-frame A German Shepherd taking part in an agility competition. Agility shows run by clubs that are affiliated to the Kennel Club continue to dominate the British agility scene. They host qualifiers for the most prestigious competitions at Crufts dog show near Birmingham each March, and Olympia in London each December. They also provide a route for winning the three Championship classes needed to gain an agility dog the coveted 'Agility Champion' title. Progression at KC shows is via a win-based system or a dog can progress on points if the handler chooses. Classes can number anything up to 450 dogs and class sizes vary considerably. They can be as small as 4 or 5 dogs or as large as 200 dogs. If a larger number of entries is received for one class then the organising club will generally split the class into separate parts with a separate set of prizes for each part. Generally classes for small and medium-sized dogs are smaller than for the large dogs. From January 2007, the KC has adopted a new grading system. Dogs with new handlers start in Grade 1 Elementary, and if they gain the wins required move up through Starters, Graduate, Novice, Intermediate and Senior to Grade 7 Advanced level. By the time a dog reaches Advanced (at which point it becomes eligible for Championship classes), it will have won many classes. The new grading system also provides the option to progress as far as Grade 5 Intermediate via a points system, run in conjunction with the Kennel Club's Agility Warrant (AW) agility titles. The Kennel Club introduced its International Festival of Agility in 2005, a weekend event that hosts a range of national team and individual competitions and finals, including the British Open. The KC also funds the British agility team that is sent to the FCI world championships each year. = Other UK agility shows = The British Agility Association (BAA) was launched in 2006 Following the success of EMDAC (East Midlands Dog Agility Club which was the first Independent Agility Association in the UK founded in 2002 by June Bass & Steve Retter) BAA provides its own progression system, with dogs being promoted via a ranking system based on performance at BAA shows. BAA shows are run both by the main EMDAC team and BAA affiliated independent clubs around the country. EMDAC host the BAA National Finals, a 3-day event in August each year. UK Agility (UKA), launched in 2004, provides two separate progression programmes leading to agility titles. The Performance programme requires points to be gained in a range of Agility, Jumping and Games classes such as Gamblers and Snooker. This titling system has many similarities with that of the USDAA in the United States. The Steeplechase programme is based on Steeplechase classes consisting only of jumps and tunnels. UKA shows are run by both the main UKA team and affiliated independent clubs. UKA runs a weeklong show with its national championships in August each year, and also sends a team to the IFCS world championships. In addition, a number of independent clubs and groups around the United Kingdom hold one-off shows or short series of shows that are not affiliated with any of the above organisations.  Agility in Canada  In Canada dog agility is largely sanctioned by the Agility Association of Canada (AAC). In western Canada however, it is not uncommon to also see trials sanctioned by the North American Dog Agility Council (NADAC); in eastern Canada NADAC sanctioned trials are rare. Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) agility trials are uncommon and are mostly associated with specialty shows for purebreds in conjunction with other events.  Agility in the United States  The first agility competition in the United States took place around 1986 under the rules of the newly formed United States Dog Agility Association (USDAA). =Qualification for competition= For all organizations, dogs can compete provided that they are: *Registered with the specific organization *Physically sound (blindness, deafness AKC Regulations, and physical impairments interfering with functional movement may disqualify a dog from eligibility; consult each organization for more specific information) *At least the minimum age (for example, 15 months in AKC and CPE, 18 months in USDAA and NADAC) *Not a female in heat (some venues allow bitches in season to compete, usually at the discretion of the hosting club) *Well-behaved enough to be off leash around other dogs and people; for example, dogs who attack the judge, other people, or other dogs may be expelled from the trial site and may eventually be banned from competing Dogs of any size, ancestry, or nationality can compete, except for in TDAA, which limits dogs to those of no more than 17\\" at the withers. On April 1, 2010, the AKC began allowing mixed breed dogs to compete in agility along with purebred dogs and dogs with a PAL/ILP listing. =Agility titles and championships= For most sanctioning organizations, there are a variety of titles that a dog and handler can earn by accruing sufficient qualifying runs‚Äîalso called legs‚Äîthat is, runs that have no more than a certain number of faults (typically none) and are faster than the maximum standard course time (SCT). For example, under USDAA rules, a dog can earn novice-level titles in Standard, Jumpers, Gamblers, Snooker, and Pairs Relay classes by earning 3 qualifying runs in each of the classes; the dog can also earn intermediate- level titles and masters-level titles in the same classes. After earning all of the masters-level titles‚Äîfive qualifying runs in each, with some that must be in the top 15% of dogs competing at each trial‚Äîthe dog earns its Championship. Other organizations have similar schemes; in AKC, to earn the Championship, the dog's qualifying runs must be earned two at a time on the same day; in NADAC, the quantity of qualifying runs is much larger; and so on. Most champion titles have \\"CH\\" in the title: NATCH (NADAC Agility Trial Champion), ADCH (Agility Dog Champion for USDAA), CATCH (CPE Agility Trial Champion), MACH (Master Agility Champion for AKC), TACH (Teacup Agility Champion), ATCH (ASCA Agility Trial Champion) and so on. =National championships= A dalmatian taking part in an agility competition. In addition, each sanctioning organization holds its national championships each year. Dogs must meet certain minimum scoring requirements to qualify to compete in the annual championship; for example, the dog must earn qualifying scores in at least 50% of the runs at each of at least 3 trials during the year; or must place in the top certain percentage of dogs at certain trials; or must have a qualifying run in special regional qualifying events; and so on. As with any agility competition, there are national champions in each height category because it is not possible for dogs of greatly different sizes to compete equally. USDAA national championships USDAA has 12\\", 16\\", 22\\", and 26\\" (30, 40, 55, and 66 cm) jump-height categories; it crowns four national Grand Prix champions each year, as well as four Veterans and four Performance (lower-level performance) Grand Prix champions. It also holds championships for its Dog Agility Steeplechase and its Dog Agility Masters Three-Dog Team tournament series. AKC national championships To qualify for the AKC Dog Agility Nationals, dogs must obtain double Qs and points during the preceding year. (The exact number of each has been increasing each year - for 2008 it is 6 double Qs and 400 MACH points.) A double Q means that the dog has earned qualifying scores in both runs of a single day of competition. Points are earned by the number of seconds under the standard course time that the dog takes to run a course, and are multiplied by various factors based on placement. At Nationals, dogs compete against their height division of 8\\", 12\\", 16\\", 20\\", 24\\", or 26\\". The AKC Nationals are often televised. The AKC also runs an annual breed invitational to represent the best dogs from each breed. The invitational qualification and competition are similar to those of the Nationals.

External link:  International championships  Some competitions invite qualified entrants from multiple countries, thereby making them international championships. Examples include: * F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale Agility World Championships, the oldest and best- known, is held every year. It had been held in Europe every year until 2013, where it is to be hosted by South Africa. The event was held as a European championship until 1995, then a world championship from 1996, and is restricted to registered pedigree dogs only. The FCI has more than 80 member countries (via each country's kennel club), over 30 of which typically take part in the FCI World Championships. The British, American and Canadian kennel clubs are not FCI members, but their teams are allowed to participate by special invitation. * The International Mix & Breed Championship in Agility (IMCA), first held in Italy in 2000 as a response to the FCI pedigree-only championships. The competition is held annually with about 18 countries participating, including teams from outside Europe. Now open to any breed or mixed-breed dog regardless of origins, and in Europe considered to be the main international rival to the FCI championships. Since the 2002 IMCA (Gyula, Hungary), this championship is organised together with the ParAgility World Cup for disabled competitors. * The International Federation of Cynological Sports (IFCS), has since 2002 organized a biannual world agility championship open to any breed or mixed-breed dog regardless of pedigree. English-speaking member or associate member countries include the United States (via the United States Dog Agility Association), the United Kingdom (via UK Agility), Canada (via the Agility Association of Canada), and Australia (via the Agility Dog Association of Australia). Ten countries participated in the event in 2006. * The Cynosport World Games, officially named in 2003, as the consolidated venue for USDAA's three tournament series - Grand Prix of Dog Agility, $10,000 Dog Agility Steeplechase and Dog Agility Masters Three-Dog Team Championship ‚Äî and exhibitions and competitions in other popular canine sports. USDAA tournaments were opened to invited overseas participants for the first time in 2001, which led to establishment of USDAA affiliates in other countries where qualifying events are now held each year. Prior to 2001, USDAA qualifying events were limited to Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United States. The Cynosport World Games in 2006 attracted some 1,000 competitors in dog agility from twelve countries, and also now includes world championship events in flyball and flying disc. Participants from other countries may still apply for participation by invitation if USDAA qualifying events are not held in their country or region. * The European Open. An informal annual championships since its foundation in 2002, open to all dogs regardless of origins. It rotates around a small number of countries in central Europe, though attracting competitors from all over Europe, with 25 countries due to participate in the 2006 event. From 2007, the competition will be held under F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale regulations, with a view to developing it into a 'World Open'. In years when the World Dog Show is held in Europe, the European Open will be held at the World Show and not separately. * The World Agility Open Championships (WAO) See also * History of dog agility * World Dog Show References Category:Dog sports Category:Human geography ","title":"Geography of dog agility"},{"id":"13889785","text":"Through the Looking Glass is an Italian release of a live performances by the San Francisco rock band Jefferson Airplane.

Aklima Khan, a junior at Mr. Bey's alma mater, Benjamin Cardozo High School in Bayside, learned to notice details.\\" He studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York from 1977‚Äì78, and spent the next two years as part of the CETA-funded Cultural Council Foundation Artists Project. In 1990, he graduated with a BFA in Photography from Empire State College, and received his MFA from Yale University School of Art in 1993. Over the course of his career, Bey has participated in more than 20 artist residencies, which have allowed him to work directly with the adolescent subjects of his most recent work.For a comprehensive chronology of the artist‚Äôs life as well as a list of his solo exhibitions, see Jock Reynolds, Taro Nettleton, Carrie Mae Weems, and Dawoud Bey, Class Pictures: Photographs by Dawoud Bey (New York: Aperture, 2007). A product of the 1960s, Dawoud Bey said both he and his work are products of the attitude, \\"if you‚Äôre not part of the solution, you‚Äôre part of the problem.\\" This philosophy significantly influenced his artistic practice and resulted in a way of working that is both community-focused and collaborative in nature. Bey‚Äôs earliest photographs, in the style of street photography, evolved into a seminal five-year project documenting the everyday life and people of Harlem in Harlem USA (1975‚Äì1979) that was exhibited at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 1979. In 2012, the Art Institute of Chicago mounted the first complete showing of the \\"Harlem, USA\\" photographs since that original exhibition, adding several never before printed photographs to the original group of twenty-five vintage prints. The complete group of photographs were acquired at that time by the AIC. Over time Bey proves that he develops a bond with his subjects with being more political. In the article \\"Exhibits Challenge Us Not to Look Away Photographers Focus on Pain, Reality in the City\\" by Carolyn Cohen from the Boston Globe, the text identifies Bey's work as having a \\"definite political edge\\" to it according to Roy Decarava. He writes more about the aesthetics of Beys work and how it's associated with documentary photography and how his work shows empathy for his subjects. This article also mentions Bey exhibiting his work at the Walker Art Center, where Kelly Jones identifies the strength of his work and his relationship with his subjects once again.https://search.proquest.com/docview/405239244 Of his work with teenagers Bey has said, \\"My interest in young people has to do with the fact that they are the arbiters of style in the community; their appearance speaks most strongly of how a community of people defines themselves at a particular historical moment.\\" Kellie Jones, \\"Dawoud Bey: Portraits in the Theater of Desire\\" in Dawoud Bey: Portraits 1975-1995 ed. by A.D. Coleman, Jock Reynolds, Kellie Jones, and Dawoud Bey (Minneapolis, MN: Walker Art Center, 1995) 48. During a residency at the Addison Gallery of American Art in 1992, Bey began photographing students from a variety of high schools both public and private, in an effort to ‚Äúreach across lines of presumed differences‚Äù among the students and communities.Jacqueline Terrassa, \\"Shepherding Power,\\" Dawoud Bey: The Chicago Project, (Chicago, IL: Smart Museum of Art, The University of Chicago, 2003): 91. This new direction in his work guided Bey for the next fifteen years, including two additional residencies at the Addison, an ample number of similar projects across the country, and culminated in a major 2007 exhibition and publication of portraits of teenagers organized by Aperture and entitled Class Pictures. Alongside each of the photographs in Class Pictures, is a personal statement written by each subject. This rich combination of image and text expands the notion of the photographic portrait, and further creates portraits that are each incredibly powerful in its amalgamation, at times surprising, disturbing, and heart-wrenching. In 2018, his project Night Coming Tenderly, Black, consists of a series of photographs evoking the imagined experience of escaped slaves moving northward along the Underground Railroad. Currently living in Chicago, Illinois Bey is a professor of art and Distinguished College Artist at Columbia College Chicago, and is represented by Mary Boone Gallery (NYC), Rena Bransten Gallery (San Francisco), and Stephen Daiter Gallery (Chicago). Awards and exhibitions Bey was the recipient of an artist fellowship at Creative Artists Public Service (CAPS), New York in 1983, an artist fellowship from the New York Foundation for the Arts in 1986, a regional fellowship form the National Endowment for the Arts in 1991, and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in 2002.https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/dawoud-bey/ He has exhibited in a number of solo and group shows including Dawoud Bey: Portraits 1975-1995 at the Walker Art Center in 1995, Dawoud Bey at the Queens Museum of Art in 1998, Dawoud Bey: The Chicago Project at the David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art in 2003, Dawoud Bey: Detroit Portraits at the Detroit Institute of Arts in 2004, and Class Pictures, organized by the Aperture Foundation and on view initially at the Addison Gallery of American Art in 2007, and then touring to museums throughout the country for four years, including the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, and the Milwaukee Art Museum among others. His work \\"The Birmingham Project\\" commemorates the six young African Americans killed in Birmingham, AL on September 15, 1963. The exhibition opened at the Birmingham Museum of Art in September 2013, fifty years after that tragic day. The exhibition opened at George Eastman House, International Museum of Photography and Film in 2016. In early 2019, the Art Institute of Chicago hosted an exhibition titled \\"Dawoud Bey: Night Coming Tenderly, Black\\", consisting of twenty-five black and white photographs that were captured along the Underground Railroad in Cleveland and Hudson, Ohio. Bey is the recipient of the 2019 Infinity Award from the International Center of Photography. Dawoud Bey's most recent award was the MacArthur Fellowship \\"no strings attached‚Äù grant awarded by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, otherwise known as the \\"genius grant\\". The grant goes to individuals who have shown \\"extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits\\". The article \\"'A Radical Reshaping of the World is Possible, One Person at a Time': Dawoud Bey on being Awarded a MacArthur Genius Grant by Chloe Coleman of The Washington Post gives more insight about Dawoud Bey receiving his award and giving thanks.

The school maintains a Catholic ethos, being the only Catholic secondary school in the City of Derby. It educates around 1500 students, with more than 2 teachers, as well as a non- teaching support staff such as LSAs, CPMs and House Administrators. School history The school was built on its current site in, after the land had been acquired by the Sisters of Mercy, and St. Philomena's High School for Senior Girls moved from Broadway, where it had been located since 1947. In 1971, St. Philomena's merged with the local St. Mary's Secondary School. The two Catholic secondary schools in Derby - Saint Thomas More and Saint Ralph Sherwin - merged in 1986, to make the current site unique as secondary Catholic education within the city of Derby. The school was named after St. Benedict, and had a logo with a Latin motto, 'Crux Sancti Patris Benedicti' ('the cross of our holy father Benedict'), until the school logo was changed in 2002, to show a more angelic looking version of St. Benedict. Buildings The school is split into two bases, North Block and South Block, around five minutes' walk apart. The blocks used to be separate schools. Each houses a variety of resources such as the Sports Hall and Theatre. The larger collection of buildings is at 'South Block', where a library, music suite, sports hall, languages centre and design and technology block have been added since the early 1990s. Enhanced Resource Base (ERB) This is a dedicated unit set up for supporting students with a wide range of difficulties such as visual impairment, physical impairment and other learning difficulties. There are adapted computer study/teaching rooms, as well as additional rooms for staff and students to use. The ERB also has input from external specialists in careers and physio advice on a regular basis. The ERB has its own on-site IT Technician to deal with ICT related problems and a Resource Technician to handle enlargements of exam papers and texts. The ERB also has a council made up of representatives from all school years, to deal with issues surrounding the ERB and the school. North Block North Block is home to a variety of subjects like Religious Studies, Food Technology, science, Sociology and Humanities. As well as North Block reception which doubles up as the box office for The Robert Ludlam Theatre. The school chapel and the chapel garden may also be found in this building. Robert Ludlam Theatre The Robert Ludlam Theatre is a 270-seat venue with a diverse programme of entertainment including dance, drama, art, music, theatre in the round, comedy, films, family Entertainment, rock and pop events, and workshops. It provides a home for many of Derbyshire's amateur production groups.Robert Ludlam Theatre, accessed September 2009 Lafayette Suite This multi-functional space is for public speaking, network events and exhibition galleries. In June the range of Art and Textiles GCSE and A level examination work of the school's own pupils filled the gallery. External visitors flocked to the venue to view the presentations. All the exhibitions are open to the public during school days until 4:00 pm, although this is by prior arrangement with the box office. South Block The majority of lessons are taught in the earliest South Block building. It includes a floor dedicated to maths, a floor dedicated to English, and a section dedicated to Art and Design. This building also features a Gym, Dining Room, Cooking Room, Computer Room, Pottery Room and Science Rooms. A newer building adjacent to south block proper houses the main reception, library, 2 ICT Suites, the IT Technicians' office, Staff Room, Science Room, and Vocational subject rooms used for Lesuire and Tourism studies. Vocational Centre The Vocational Centre is the main room used for teaching business studies. The room is a second home for Business teachers and has the business staff room and McAuley office next door. The Music Block The department continues to provide lessons for drum kit, brass, woodwind, cello, keyboard, violin, classical guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar and voice. Pupils have taken Associated Board Exams, Trinity Exams and Rock School Exams. Based in the Saint Cecilia Music Suite, the studio is used extensively in school and is also available for hire with technician support. The equipment is scheduled to be updated this year and will then be available again for CD recordings by bands, choirs, individuals, or ensembles. Sports Hall Sport is a high priority at Saint Benedict Catholic Voluntary Academy with the Physical Education Department being staffed by 6 extremely well qualified teachers. In May 2006 the Department was successful in regaining the Sportsmark Award made by Sport England. This prestigious award which runs for 3 year cycles following the original award made in 1997 and which recognises the excellence of PE and sport in the school. The facilities include a purpose built Sports Hall (with 3 badminton courts, basketball, netball and volleyball court), a multi-gym, gymnasium, hard play area for netball and extensive playing fields with football, rugby and hockey pitches. A 400-metre athletics track is marked out in the summer. School Council Saint Benedict has a long tradition of having a pupil voice through its School Council, the school council consists of pupils from all areas of the school and is a fair representation of school. Each house has two house captains and they usually decide that one of those will be part of the school council. Head Boy and Head Girl Year 13 students may apply to become part of the Student Leadership Team. They are then interviewed by senior staff. A Head Boy and Head Girl are chosen, and lead the Team in various activities, including Takeover Day.

Participants are rewarded for visiting the pubs by train. In doing this they increase the number of passengers on the railway and bring money into the local economy. The scheme is often supported by the Campaign for Real Ale. The beer is usually brewed locally and many of the pubs offer food as well. Each trail is publicised by a free booklet that is distributed through stations and local outlets, and which is also available for downloading from the internet. Each time a pub is visited the booklet is stamped, provided a valid rail ticket is shown when a purchase is made. Once sufficient stamps have been collected, the booklet can be exchanged for merchandise specific to each trail, such as a T-shirt or badge. History On 1 October 1977 the first rail ale trail was run by Gerald Daniels, of Crookham Travel under the name \\"Rail Ale Ramble\\". A chartered train with 598 passengers ran from London to Bath, Somerset and Oxford. More than thirty years later Crookham Travel still run Rail Ale Rambles.Crookham Travel Meanwhile, the term \\"rail ale\\" has been adopted by organisations such as the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership, who promote rural train routes in the English West Country.Devon & Cornwall Rail Partnership In the 1980s the local railway management had promoted travel to pubs close to stations using the tag line \\"Let us drive you to the pub\\". Some incentives were offered to railway passengers to use certain pubs. Trails in Devon and Cornwall The Globe Inn near Looe railway station on the Looe Valley Line ale trail =Tarka Line= The Tarka Line Rail Ale Trail was the first to be launched in 2002. The \\"Beer Engine\\" at Newton St Cyres railway station had pioneered the use of rail travel to bring drinkers to its bar. It opened in 1985 in the old railway hotel opposite the station and was soon offering a discount on production of a rail ticket. The trail originally covered 16 pubs, and increased to a peak of 19, but one has since closed. There are five pubs in Exeter and four in Barnstaple, with one each at Newton St Cyres railway station, Crediton railway station, Yeoford railway station, Copplestone, Morchard Road railway station, Lapford, Eggesford railway station, Portsmouth Arms railway station, and Umberleigh. The collecting of 5, 10 or 18 stamps entitles the participant to claim Tarka Line Rail Trail merchandise. =Maritime Line= The Maritime Line Rail Ale Trail was the second to be launched, in 2003, covering 14 pubs. There are four pubs in Truro, one in Perranwell, three in Penryn, and six in Falmouth ‚Äì two of which are close to Penmere railway station, and four in the town centre. =Looe Valley Line= The Looe Valley Line Rail Ale Trail was the third pilot scheme, launched early in 2004, and covering 11 pubs between Liskeard and Looe. Seven of the pubs are in Looe and two in Liskeard. The remaining pubs are \\"Ye Old Plough House Inn\\" at Duloe, a 30-minute walk from Causeland railway station, and the \\"Polruan Country House Hotel\\" near Sandplace railway station. =Tamar Valley Line= The Tamar Valley Line Rail Ale Trail launched late in 2004 and contains 17 pubs.

The five remaining pubs are in Penzance which is usually reached by changing trains at St Erth onto the Cornish Main Line, although there are also a very few through trains from St Ives railway station. =Atlantic Coast Line= The most recent of the Devon and Cornwall rail ale trails is the Atlantic Coast Line from Par to Newquay. It was launched in 2005 with 16 pubs but one has since closed. There are three in Newquay, two near St Columb Road railway station, six in and around Par, and one each at Quintrell Downs, Roche, Bugle and Luxulyan.

A website gives details of pubs at some of the Stations on the line. Former trails Wessex Trains ran a Bristol to Weymouth Rail Ale Trail from 2005 but closed at the end of its rail franchise in 2006. Merchandise was offered for 10, 15 or 20 stamps of the 28 featured pubs which made this trail unusual in not expecting participants to visit every single pub; the award for 20 stamps included complementary tickets for a return journey anywhere on Wessex Trains services but these were only valid until the end of that franchise on 31 March 2006 - First Great Western have not repeated the offer. Four of the pubs were in Bristol, three in Bath, Somerset, two in Frome, two in Dorchester, and four in Weymouth. The remaining 13 were situated one each in Keynsham, Freshford, at Avoncliff railway station, in Bradford-on-Avon, Trowbridge, Westbury, Bruton, Castle Cary, Yeovil, Thornford, Yetminster, Chetnole, Maiden Newton.

He was elected to the St Austell Division of Cornwall in a by-election in 1908 and held the seat until his death. Military career He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal 1st Devon Imperial Yeomanry on 4 June 1902. At the outbreak of World War I he joined the Royal Bucks Hussars as an officer. Tommy then joined the Coldstream Guards and was subsequently posted to France & Flanders. Captain The Honourable Thomas Charles Reginald Agar-Robartes, in command of No. 2 Coy, 1st Bn, the Coldstream Guards, was wounded in the Battle of Loos on 28 September and killed by a sniper on 30 September 1915 after rescuing a wounded comrade under heavy fire for which he was recommended for the Victoria Cross.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB), the KBO League, and Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Rios's repertoire included a sharp slider, change-up and fastball around 90 mph. Youth Rios's parents were Cuban and he was born in Spain. At age 2, his family immigrated to the United States, where he grew up and went to college at the University of Miami. Yankees organization Rios signed as an amateur free agent with the New York Yankees in 1993. He debuted with the GCL Yankees, going 2‚Äì1 with a 3.52 ERA and six saves in 24 games. He was the closer on a team that briefly featured Mariano Rivera (who was then a starter). In 1994, Rios had his first year in full- season ball, going 3‚Äì2 with 17 saves and a 0.87 ERA in 37 games for the Greensboro Bats and allowing no earned runs (2 runs overall) in 10.1 IP for the Tampa Yankees (2 saves in 9 games). Rios's composite ERA of 0.70 was presumably one of the lowest in all of the minor leagues that year. Rios remained dazzling in 1995. With Tampa, he had a 2.00 ERA, 0‚Äì4 record, 24 saves and 72 strikeouts in 67.1 IP. He finished 53 games, most in the Florida State League. Rios moved to the cusp of the major leagues in 1996. He went 3‚Äì1 with 17 saves and a 2.09 ERA for the Norwich Navigators and 4‚Äì1 with a 1.95 ERA in 24 games for the Columbus Clippers. Baseball America rated him as the #9 prospect in the Yankee system, one spot ahead of fellow right-hander Tony Armas, Jr.. Rios spent most of 1997 with Columbus, doing an effective job, if not as impressive as his prior three years. In 58 games, he went 7‚Äì4 with 3 saves and a 3.08 ERA. He was four games pitched behind teammate Dale Polley for the International League lead. He made his major league debut in rough form on May 30, relieving Ramiro Mendoza with two on and one out against the Boston Red Sox. He promptly served up back-to-back home runs to Wil Cordero and Mo Vaughn, the first two batters he faced. An inning later, Scott Hatteberg added another homer. Rios had allowed 3 runs in 1 IP, all on homers. He returned to Columbus but came back to the Yankees for a game late in the year, replacing Hideki Irabu with one on and one out in the 7th inning on September 5. He allowed three straight singles, bringing in one inherited runner and one another score. After back-to-back singles to open the 8th, he was replaced by Graeme Lloyd, ending a horrible rookie year in the majors ‚Äì 9 hits and 5 runs in 2 innings plus three inherited runners plated. Royals system The Yankees waived Rios in March 1998 and he was picked up by the Kansas City Royals. He threw in five games early in the year for Kansas City, but struggled. He went 0‚Äì1 with a 6.14 ERA and would never again pitch in the major leagues, though he was just 25. He went 6‚Äì7 with one save and a 5.63 ERA for the 1998 Omaha Royals, being used regularly as a starting pitcher for the first time in his professional career. Rios was moved back to the bullpen in 1999 but the results were not good. He went 10‚Äì4 with Omaha to tie for the team lead in wins and saved four games, but had a 6.07 ERA. Independent leagues and Mexico In 2000, Rios moved to the Newark Bears, going 2‚Äì3 with a 4.26 ERA. He went to the Mexican League, where he was 6‚Äì3 with a 3.12 ERA for the Algodoneros de Union Laguna. Rios was 18‚Äì5 with a 2.98 ERA for Union Laguna in 2001, finishing 9th in the Mexican League in ERA. He led the Liga in victories. South Korea Rios drew notice overseas and was picked up by the KIA Tigers of the KBO League in 2002. He helped the club finish second in his first season there, going 14‚Äì5 with 13 saves and a 3.14 ERA. He was fourth in the Korea Baseball Organization in ERA. He fell to 10‚Äì13 in 2003, but his 3.82 ERA still ranked ninth in the KBO. In 2004, Rios led the KBO with 223 innings pitched. He went 17‚Äì8 with a 2.87 ERA, finishing fourth in ERA behind Park Myung-hwan, Gary Rath, and Bae Young-soo. He tied Rath and Bae for the league lead in wins (though Bae had six fewer losses than Rios and Rath). At age 32, the right-hander was traded mid-season to the Doosan Bears. Cumulatively, he was 15‚Äì12 with a 3.51 ERA, third in the KBO in ERA behind Son Min-han and Kim Won-hyeong. He battled control problems, walking 147 in 205 innings pitched, but also tied Bae for the KBO lead in strikeouts (also 147). Rios was 12‚Äì16 with a 2.90 ERA in 2006 for Doosan. Rios finished the 2007 season 22‚Äì5 with a 2.07 ERA, leading the league in wins and ERA. He became the first 20-game winner in the KBO since Chung Min-tae won that many in 1999 (KBO schedules at that point were only 126 games, making 20-game winners rarer than in the US). He was the first foreigner to win 20 games in a year (not counting Japanese natives of South Korean descent). He won five more games than runners-up Ryu Hyun-jin and Kenny Rayborn, and his ERA was 0.77 was ahead of runner-up Chae Byung-ryong. He whiffed 147, second in the KBO to Ryu, to miss out on the \\"Pitching Triple Crown\\". Rios' 22 wins was the highest total by a pitcher since Jang Myeong-bu in 1983. Rios became the fifth pitcher in KBO history to have won 10+ games in six consecutive seasons, following Kim Si-jin (1983‚Äì1988), Sun Dong-yeol (1986‚Äì1991), Lee Kang-chul (1989‚Äì1998), and Jung Min-chul (1992‚Äì1999). Rios continued his dominance in the postseason. In game one of the 2007 Korean Series, Rios threw a four-hit shutout against the SK Wyverns. Rios capped off the season by winning the 2007 KBO League Most Valuable Player Award. Rios finished the 2007 season with a career KBO record of 90‚Äì59, an ERA of 3.01, and 807 strikeouts. NPB: Doping case, suspension, and retirement  In June 2008, while playing for the Yakult Swallows in the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), Rios tested positive for a metabolite of the anabolic steroid stanozolol and was subsequently banned from Japanese baseball for a year. He never played professionally again.

This line has a historical connection to the Takeda family through the founder's grandfather, Nakamura Yorifusa. Yorifusa was a retainer of the Koshu Takeda who founded a school of jujutsu called Taiyo ryu. Yoshin Koryu was founded by Nakamura Yoshikuni in Nagasaki after being driven from Takeda lands by Tokugawa Ieyasu. It is stated that Yoshin Koryu was a mixture of Taiyo ryu and knowledge gained by Yoshikuni‚Äôs exposure to Chinese martial arts and medicine, knowledge gained while living in Nagasaki and in nearby Miura village. History An area of confusion concerning this school is its founding in Nagasaki, where the more ubiquitous school using the name of Y≈çshin-ry≈´ (Akiyama line) and another school named Miura ryu was founded. This other Miura ryu was founded by Miura Yojuiemon of the Fukuno ryu jujutsu lineages. This school was reportedly influenced by the Chinese martial artist and scholar, Chin Genpin. One wonders if there was some cross pollination between all these schools as all reportedly were in existence in Nagasaki in the first half of the 17th century. This school survived 11 generations. The last fully licensed actively teaching instructor of Yoshin Koryu ryu jujutsu was Kanaya Motoyoshi who died in the early 20th century. With his death the Yoshin Koryu jujutsu school lost transmission and no longer exists. Densho were apparently passed on to a 12th generation headmaster but the waza are no longer practiced. The various names used for this school: Yoshin Koryu, Miura Yoshin ryu, Miura ryu, Yoshin ryu, and Totsuka ha Yoshin ryu.

Its relief is a plateau surrounded by mountains. Matheysine is also called Plateau Matheysin. Matheysine from Sommet du Serre de l'Horizon, minor summit on S√©n√©py mountain Geography The Plateau Matheysin is located in the Is√®re d√©partement, 30 km south of Grenoble when heading to Gap. Included in the overall Taillefer massif, its average elevation is 1,000 m. Vercors and Mont Aiguille viewed from summit of S√©n√©py mountain Belonging to south-Dauphin√©, it is crossed over by the 45th parallel north and roughly matches the boundaries of the canton of La Mure. It is around 20 km long from north to south and around 13 km wide from east to west. At the south and at the west, the border of the plateau is marked by the Drac River, which defines the boundary with Tri√®ves (at the south) and with the Vercors Plateau (at the west). At the north, the plateau ends at the Laffrey slope down to the Romanche valley at the elevation of 350m. At the east, the small mountain range including the summits of Grand Serre (elev. 2,141m.) and Tabor (elev. 2,389m.) marks the boundary with the Valbonnais canton. Beside these mountains, the plateau is crossed over from north to south by the summits of the Connest Mountain (Peyrouse, Connex) and of the S√©n√©py. These mountains overlook a succession of four lakes of glacier origin called the Laffrey lakes. From north to south, these lakes are composed of the lac Mort, the Grand lac de Laffrey, the Petichet lake, the Pierre-Ch√¢tel lake. Close to the Pierre-Ch√¢tel lake can be found one of the so-called Seven Wonders of Dauphin√©, a natural arch called the Pierre Perc√©e. La Mure is Matheysine's main city. Climate On this plateau, shaped by glaciers during the previous glacial periods and surrounded by high mountain ranges, the bise wind blows intensely, being frosty during Winter, but pleasant in Summer. Furthermore, at Winter time, the area can face heavy snowfalls. For these reasons, Matheysine is being nicknamed Little Siberia. History =Etymology= The area has been called Mathaysana (11th century) and later Mataisine (13th century) and Mattacena (14th century), which could possibly be derived from Matta (\\"to be wet\\") and Cena (\\"plateau\\"). This depicts actually rather well both the geography and the climatic characteristics of the place. The inhabitants of Matheysine are called Matheysins. =Napol√©on I in Matheysine= The alpine road used by emperor Napol√©on I, after having landed at Juan-les-Pins on his return from Elba, crosses Matheysine. There, in a prairie located along the shore of Grand lac de Laffrey, at the place now called Prairie de la Rencontre (Meeting Prairie), the emperor and his troops (1,100 men led by 3 generals) met the royal army sent in order to stop them. Napol√©on succeeded in rallying his opponents to his cause and could finally proceed to Grenoble. An equestrian statue of Napol√©on still reminds this event. =Coal mining= The history of Matheysine has been strongly impacted by coal mining. This coal, of superior quality (anthracite), has been extracted since the beginning of the 19th century until the late 1990s. It has highly contributed to the reputation of the plateau. Economic characteristics Matheysine has been going through an economic reconversion since the planned decline and the cessation of the coal mining activity on the plateau. New industries installations have been favoured through aids and fiscal easy terms. Tourism, as well as local craft industry, also help at renewing Matheysine's economic health. Furthermore, the area presently experiences the arrival of urban people from the Grenoble built-up area, looking for more affordable real estate costs whilst keeping on working downtown. This phenomenon is partly contributing to a revival of the local trade.

The Isaurian emperors were successful in defending and consolidating the Empire against the Caliphate after the onslaught of the early Muslim conquests, but were less successful in Europe, where they suffered setbacks against the Bulgars, had to give up the Exarchate of Ravenna, and lost influence over Italy and the Papacy to the growing power of the Franks. The Isaurian dynasty is chiefly associated with Byzantine Iconoclasm, an attempt to restore divine favour by purifying the Christian faith from excessive adoration of icons, which resulted in considerable internal turmoil. By the end of the Isaurian dynasty in 802, the Byzantines were continuing to fight the Arabs and the Bulgars for their very existence, with matters made more complicated when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne Imperator Romanorum (\\"Emperor of the Romans\\") which was seen as an attempt at making the Carolingian Empire the successor to the Roman Empire. Background: Byzantium in the 7th century The Heraclian dynasty (610‚Äì695 and 705‚Äì711) faced heavy challenges. After successfully overcoming the Sassanid Persians, the Emperor Heraclius (r. 610‚Äì641) and his exhausted realm were faced with the sudden onset of the Muslim expansion from Arabia into the Levant.Whittow (1996), pp. 73‚Äì82 Following the Muslim conquest of Syria, the rich province of Egypt, the Empire's chief source of grain and tax revenue, had fallen to the Arabs. The Byzantines also faced Arab attacks through Libya against the Exarchate of Africa, against Cilicia, which controlled the southern passes into Asia Minor, now the Empire's last major contiguous territory, and against the Armenian Highland, the Empire's chief source of manpower and a vital buffer between the now Arab-dominated Syrian Desert region and the northeastern passage into Asia Minor. These three areas would be the main fields of Byzantine-Arab contention during the next half-century.Cheynet (2006), pp. 3‚Äì6 The Arabs continued to make headway, most notably constructing a navy that successfully challenged Byzantine supremacy in the Mediterranean. The outbreak of the Muslim civil war in 656 bought the Byzantines time, and emperor Constans II (r. 641‚Äì668) reinforced his position in the Balkans and Italy. His successor, Constantine IV (r. 668‚Äì685), was able to beat off the First Arab Siege of Constantinople (674‚Äì678), and in its aftermath move into the counteroffensive, securing Asia Minor, recovering Cilicia and forcing the Caliphate to pay tribute. At the same time however, he was defeated by the Bulgar khan Asparukh, and was forced to accept his people's settlement in Byzantine lands south of the Danube.Cheynet (2006), pp. 6‚Äì9 With the first deposition of Constantine IV's son and heir Justinian II in 695 began a period of troubles that lasted almost a quarter-century and brought a succession of disasters that nearly brought about the downfall of the Byzantine state. Carthage finally fell in 697 and a Byzantine recovery attempt defeated next year. Cilicia was conquered by the Arabs and turned into a base for raiding expeditions that penetrated deep into Asia Minor, sacking its forts and cities, while the Caucasus brought under firm Muslim control. Finally, the Umayyad caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 715‚Äì717) began preparing another huge expedition to conquer Constantinople.Cheynet (2006), pp. 10‚Äì12Whittow (1996), p. 138 At the same time, the disasters of the 7th century saw major changes in the society and nature of what remained of the Empire: the urbanized, cosmopolitan civilization of Late Antiquity came to an end, and the Medieval era began. With the decline of most cities to a small, fortified urban cores that functioned merely as administrative centres, society became largely agrarian, while education and intellectual life almost vanished. The loss of the Empire's richest provinces, coupled with successive invasions, reduced the imperial economy to a relatively impoverished state, compared to the resources available to the Caliphate. The monetary economy persisted, but the barter economy experienced a revival as well.Kazhdan (1991), pp. 350‚Äì351Whittow (1996), pp. 89‚Äì95 Administrative practice also changed: alongside the continued existence of the late Roman provincial system, the surviving field armies were reorganised into the theme system as a means to preserve the remaining imperial territory, although the extensive power concentrated in the hands of the thematic commanders, the strategoi, made them prone to rebel. At the same time, the central bureaucracy in Constantinople also rose in importance.Kazhdan (1991), pp. 351, 2035Whittow (1996), pp. 119‚Äì121 In the religious field, the loss of the Monophysite eastern provinces ended the need for the unsuccessful compromise doctrine of Monotheletism, which was abandoned at the Third Council of Constantinople in 680,Cheynet (2006), p. 9 while the Quinisext Council in 692 saw the promotion of the interests and views of the Patriarchate of Constantinople against the See of Rome.Haldon (1990), pp. 73‚Äì74 The Empire in crisis, 705‚Äì717 themes ca. 717 After Justinian II's second overthrow, the Byzantine Empire spiralled into another era of chaos matched only by Phocas' mishandling of the last Persian War. Philippikos Bardanes, the Crimean rebel who seized the throne proved to be totally incompetent for rule. Rather than face the looming threat of the Bulgars or the Arabs, he intended to reignite the religious controversies by imposing the much hated Heraclian Monothelitism. When King Tervel of Bulgaria (who was an ally of Justinian II) invaded Thrace, Bardanes had no choice but to summon the troops of the Opsician Theme to combat the Bulgars. Unfortunately for the Emperor, the troops had no loyalty whatsoever to him and after the ritual blinding he was replaced in June 713 by the chief secretary of the Emperor, Artemios. Artemios was crowned as Anastasios II. Anastasios gave the Empire a brief taste of good leadership, improving the walls of the capital and filling the granaries of the capital to bursting point, in order that the newly reported Arab invasion be dealt with. Every citizen was told to gather enough food for three years for if the Arabs were to reach the straits it would undoubtedly be a lengthy siege. However, Anastasios proved too good for the Empire; in an effort to avert the Arab siege of the Capital, Anastasios planned a preemptive strike against the invaders, using Rhodes as a base. However the Opsician Theme once more revolted and Anastasios found himself in a Thessalonika monastery by 715. The Opsicians chose Theodosios, an unwilling tax-collector, to rule the Empire. The choice was hardly based upon his skills; when Leo the Isaurian, strategos of the Anatolic theme, asked the Senate and the Patriarch for his support in becoming emperor, it took little persuading to obtain it.  Leo III the Isaurian, 717‚Äì741  Leo III, who would become the founder of the so-called Isaurian dynasty, was actually born in Germanikeia in northern Syria c. 685; his alleged origin from Isauria derives from a reference in Theophanes the Confessor, which however may be a later addition. After being raised to spatharios by Justinian II, he fought the Arabs in Abasgia, and was appointed as strategos of the Anatolics by Anastasios II.Kazhdan (1991), pp. 1014, 1208 Following the latter's fall, in 716 Leo allied himself with Artabasdos, the general of the Armeniacs, and was proclaimed emperor while two Arab armies, one under the Caliph's brother Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik, campaigned in Asia Minor. Leo averted an attack by Maslamah by clever negotiations, in which he promised to recognize the Caliph's suzerainty, but on 25 March 717, he entered Constantinople and deposed Theodosios.Kazhdan (1991), p. 1208Treadgold (1997), p. 345Cheynet (2006), p. 12 = Arab siege of Constantinople and its aftermath = solidus of Leo III showing his son and heir, Constantine V Within months, the new Emperor faced his first great challenge, with a massive Muslim attack on the imperial capital: the Caliphate's army and navy, led by Maslamah, numbered some 120,000 men and 1,800 ships according to the sources. Whatever the real number, it was a huge force, far larger than the Imperial army. Thankfully for Leo and the Empire, Anastasios II had repaired and strengthened the capital's sea walls. In addition, the Emperor concluded an alliance with the Bulgar khan Tervel, who agreed to harass the invaders' rear.Treadgold (1997), pp. 346‚Äì347 From July 717 to August 718, the city was besieged by land and sea by the Muslims, who built an extensive double line of circumvallation and contravallation on the landward side, isolating the capital. Their attempt to complete the blockade by sea however failed when the Byzantine navy employed Greek fire against them; the Arab fleet kept well off the city walls, leaving Constantinople's supply routes open. Forced to extend the siege into winter, the besieging army suffered horrendous casualties from the cold and the lack of provisions.Treadgold (1997), p. 347Cheynet (2006), p. 13 In spring, new reinforcements were sent by the new caliph, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (r. 717‚Äì720), by sea from Africa and Egypt and over land through Asia Minor. The crews of the new fleets were composed mostly of Christians, who began defecting in large numbers, while the land forces were ambushed and defeated in Bithynia. As famine and an epidemic continued to plague the Arab camp, the siege was abandoned on 15 August 718. On its return, the Arab fleet suffered further casualties to storms and an eruption of the volcano of Thera.Treadgold (1997), pp. 347‚Äì349 Even during the siege, Leo had been able to stifle attempts at secession: his troops swiftly overthrew a revolt in Sicily, where a certain Basil Onomagoulos was declared emperor. In 719, he also weathered an attempt by the deposed Anastasios II to recover his throne with Bulgar help.Treadgold (1997), pp. 347, 349 Leo further strengthened his position by crowning his wife Maria as Augusta in 718 and his son Constantine as co-emperor in 720.Kazhdan (1991), p. 1209 Profiting from the weakened state of the Caliphate after the enormous losses they had suffered before Constantinople, Leo was able to launch a counter-offensive which achieved some success. The Arabs soon recovered however, and from 720 launched annual raids that devastated large parts of Asia Minor, despite a Byzantine alliance with the Khazars, who launched attacks on the Caliphate's northern flank. Iconium and Caesarea were sacked, and Byzantine troops were again driven out of Armenia.Treadgold (1997), pp. 349‚Äì350 =Beginning of Iconoclasm= Folio from the 9th century iconophile Chludov Psalter, likening the iconoclasts, shown painting over an image of Christ, with the soldiers who crucified him Leo's frustration at his military failures led him to believe, in the fashion of the time, that the Empire had lost divine favour. Already in 722 he had tried to force the conversion of the Empire's Jews, but soon he began to turn his attention to the veneration of icons, which some bishops had come to regard as idolatrous. Following the renewed eruption of Thera in 726, he published an edict condemning their use, and had the image of Christ removed from the Chalke Gate, the ceremonial entrance to the Great Palace of Constantinople. The Emperor showed himself increasingly critical of the iconophiles, and in a court council in 730 he formally banned depictions of religious figures.Treadgold (1997), pp. 350‚Äì353Whittow (1996), pp. 139‚Äì142 Leo's espousal of iconoclasm caused reactions among both the populace and the Church. The soldiers that took down the image of Christ from the Chalke were lynched, and a thematic rebellion that broke out in Greece in 727, was at least in part motivated by iconophile fervour. The Patriarch Germanos I resigned, to be replaced by the more pliant Anastasios. The emperor's edict drew the condemnation of popes Gregory II and Gregory III, as well as John of Damascus. Generally however, the dispute remained limited, as Leo refrained from actively persecuting iconophiles.Treadgold (1997), pp. 352‚Äì354 The rift with the Papacy had other reasons as well: Leo transferred the dioceses of the eastern Illyricum (roughly the old Diocese of Macedonia) from Rome to the jurisdiction of Constantinople, and further deprived the Pope of the revenues of Sicily and Calabria. At the same time, Leo failed to provide aid to the embattled Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna. In 727, the local Byzantine forces overthrew their commander, and in c. 738, the city was taken for a time by the Lombard king Liutprand.Kazhdan (1991), pp. 1208‚Äì1209, 1774Treadgold (1997), pp. 352, 355Cheynet (2006), p. 14 =Final years= The adoption of iconoclasm seemed indeed to be vindicated in the Emperor's eyes, for success returned to the Imperial arms, and the Muslims suffered a series of defeats between 727 and 732. The next years were more difficult, especially as the Arabs defeated the Khazars and forced their leader to convert to Islam. In 740 however the emperor and his son scored a decisive victory over an invading Arab army at Akroinon, which halted the momentum of the Arab attacks.Whittow (1996), p. 143Treadgold (1997), p. 355 In March 741 (older sources prefer to date it to 726), Leo also promulgated the Ecloga, a revised selection of laws, drawn chiefly from the older Codex Justinianus. Christian influence is evident in the marked decrease of crimes subject to capital punishment, but the collection conversely expanded the use of mutilation, perceived as more humane, as punishment. The Ecloga proved popular as a concise legal handbook, remaining the standard legal text until the introduction of the Epanagoge in the late 9th century, and was translated into Slavonic, Arabic and Armenian.Kazhdan (1991), pp. 672‚Äì673, 1208Treadgold (1997), p. 350 Leo died peacefully in his bed on 18 June 741, the first emperor to do so since Constantine IV. During his reign, he had succeeded in warding off the Arab attacks and consolidating the Empire's eastern frontier. On the other hand, his introduction of a new and unnecessary theological dispute, albeit for the moment relatively mild, compromised his efforts to restore stability to the Empire.Treadgold (1997), p. 356  Constantine V, 741‚Äì775  Constantine was born in Constantinople, the son and successor of Emperor Leo III and Maria. In August 720 he was associated on the throne by his father, who had him marry Tzitzak, daughter of the Khazar khagan Bihar. His new bride was baptized as Irene (Eirƒìnƒì, \\"peace\\") in 732. Constantine V succeeded his father as sole emperor on April 19, 741. =Civil war against Artabasdos and first battles against veneration of images= Constantine was crossing Asia Minor to campaign against the Umayyad Caliphate under Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik on the eastern frontier in June 741 or 742. But during this course Constantine was attacked by the forces of his brother-in-law Artabasdos, the stratƒìgos of the Armeniac theme. Artabasdos was the husband of Anna, an older sister of Constantine. Defeated, Constantine sought refuge in Amorion, while the victor advanced on Constantinople and was accepted as emperor. While Constantine now received the support of the Anatolic and Thracesian themes, Artabasdos secured that of the themes of Thrace and Opsikion, in addition to his own Armeniac soldiers. After the rival emperors had bided their time in military preparations, Artabasdos marched against Constantine, but was defeated in May 743. Three months later Constantine defeated Artabasdos' son Niketas and headed for Constantinople. In early November Constantine was admitted into the capital and immediately turned on his opponents, having them blinded or executed. Perhaps because Artabasdos' usurpation was interconnected with the restoration of veneration of images, Constantine now became perhaps an even more fervent iconoclast than his father. Constantine's derogatory epithet Kopronymos (\\"Dung-named\\": from kopros, \\"feces\\" or \\"animal dung\\"; and onoma, \\"name\\"), was applied to him by his avowed enemies over this extremely emotional issue, the iconodules. Using the obscene name they spread the rumour that, as an infant, he had defecated in his baptismal font, or the imperial purple cloth with which he was swaddled. =Campaign against icons= Constantine's position about iconoclasm was clear: In February 754 Constantine convened a synod at Hieria, which was attended entirely by Iconoclast bishops. The council approved of Constantine's religious policy and secured the election of a new Iconoclast patriarch, but refused to follow in all of Constantine's views. The council confirmed the status of Mary as Theotokos, or Mother of God, reinforced the use of the terms \\"saint\\" and \\"holy\\" as meet, and condemned the desecration, burning, or looting of churches in the quest to quench Iconophiles. It was followed by a campaign to remove images from the walls of churches and to purge the court and bureaucracy of Iconodules. Since monasteries tended to be strongholds of Iconophile sentiment, Constantine specifically targeted the monks, pairing them off and forcing them to marry nuns in the Hippodrome and expropriating monastic property for the benefit of the state or the army. The repressions against the monks (culminating in 766) were largely led by the emperor's general Michael Lachanodrakon, who threatened resistant monks with blinding and exile. An iconodule abbot, Stephen Neos, was brutally lynched by a mob at the behest of the authorities. As a result, many monks fled to southern Italy and Sicily. By the end of Constantine's reign, Iconoclasm had gone as far as to brand relics and prayers to the saints as heretical. Ultimately, iconophiles considered his death a divine punishment. In the 9th century, he was disinterred and his remains were thrown into the sea. =Campaigns against the Arabs and Bulgaria= Constantine was also an able general and administrator. He reorganised the themes, the military districts of the empire, and created new field army divisions called tagmata. This organization was intended to minimize the threat of conspiracies and to enhance the defensive capabilities of the Empire. With this reorganized army he embarked on campaigns on the three major frontiers. In 746, profiting by the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate which was falling apart under Marwan II, Constantine invaded Syria and captured Germanikeia (modern Mara≈ü, his father's birthplace). He organised the resettlement of part of the local Christian population to imperial territory in Thrace. In 747 his fleet destroyed the Arab fleet off Cyprus. In 752 Constantine led an invasion into the new Abbasid Caliphate under As- Saffah. Constantine captured Theodosioupolis and Melitene (Malatya), and again resettled some of the population in the Balkans. These campaigns failed to secure any concrete gains (apart from additional population employed to strengthen another frontier), but it is important to note that under Constantine V the Empire had gone on the offensive. These successes made it possible to pursue an aggressive policy in the Balkans. With the resettlement of Christian populations from the East into Thrace, Constantine V aimed to enhance the prosperity and defence of this area which caused concern to the Empire's northern neighbour, Bulgaria, and the two states clashed in 755. Kormisosh of Bulgaria raided as far as the Anastasian Wall, but was defeated in battle by Constantine V, who inaugurated a long series of nine successful campaigns against the Bulgarians in the next year, scoring a victory over Kormisosh's successor Vinekh at Marcellae. Three year later he was defeated in the battle of the Rishki Pass but the Bulgarians did not exploit their success. In 763, he sailed to Anchialus with 800 ships carrying 9,600 cavalry and some infantry. Constantine's victories, including that at Anchialus in 763 caused considerable instability in Bulgaria, where six monarchs lost their crowns on account of their failures. In 751, Lombard king Aistulf captured Ravenna, ending over two centuries of Byzantine rule. In 775, Constantine was persuaded to reveal to the Bulgarian ruler Telerig the identities of his agents in Bulgaria. These were promptly eliminated; thus, Constantine began preparations for a new campaign against the Bulgarians ‚Äì during which he died on September 14, 775. Constantine's campaigns were costly; during his reign the Byzantine Empire's annual revenues were reduced to about 1,800,000 nomismata due to his various wars and the Arab conquests.  Leo IV, 775‚Äì780  Leo was the son of Emperor Constantine V by his first wife, Tzitzak of Khazaria (known as Irene upon her conversion), the daughter of a Khagan of the Khazars (thought to be Bihar). Crowned co-emperor by his father in 751 Leo then married Irene, an Athenian from a noble family, in December 769. In 775 Constantine V died, leaving Leo as sole emperor.The Chronicle of Theophanes Anni Mundi 6095-6305 (A.D. 602-813): Tr. Harry Turtledove (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1982), p 135-136. On 24 April 776 Leo, following the precedent set by his father and grandfather, appointed his son, Constantine VI, co-emperor. This led to an uprising of Leo's five half-brothers, including Caesar Nikephoros, who had hoped to gain the throne themselves. The uprising was put down quickly, with the conspirators being beaten, tonsured, and exiled to Cherson under guard.The Chronicle of Theophanes Anni Mundi 6095-6305 (A.D. 602-813): Tr. Harry Turtledove (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1982), 137. Leo IV was raised as an iconoclast under his father but was married to Irene, an iconodule.Byzantium: The Imperial Centuries (A.D. 610-1071): Romilly Jenkins (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1966), p 92.The Byzantine Revival: Warren Treadgold (Stanford University Press, 1988), p 5. Realizing the division in his realm he pursued a path of conciliation towards the iconodules, previously declared heretical under imperial policy. Leo allowed monks, persecuted and deported under his father, to return to their monasteries, and he was anointed by some among the orthodox as ‚ÄúFriend to the Mother of God‚Äù for allowing monks to retain images of the Theotokos. In addition to the concessionary actions Leo also appointed an iconodule sympathizer, Paul of Cyprus, to the position of patriarch of Constantinople upon the death of the predecessor. At the end of his reign, Leo reversed his stance of toleration.Byzantium: The Imperial Centuries (A.D. 610-1071): Romilly Jenkins (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1966), p 91. Leo's reign coincided with that of the third Abbasid Caliph, Al-Mahdi, who invaded Byzantine lands on successive occasions from 777‚Äì780 before ultimately being repulsed by Leo's armies, led by generals such as Michael Lachanodrakon. Leo himself set out with his army against the Bulgars but died of fever while on campaign.A History of Byzantium (second edition): Timothy E. Gregory (Blackwell, 2010), p 213. Leo's death on 8 September 780 resulted in the ascension of his wife, Irene, to the throne.  Constantine VI and the regency of Irene, 780‚Äì797  Constantine VI was the only child of Emperor Leo IV and Irene. Constantine was crowned co-emperor by his father in 776, and succeeded as sole emperor at the age of nine under the regency of Irene in 780. Gold solidus showing Irene alongside her son Constantine VI In 782 he was betrothed to Rotrude, a daughter of the Frankish King Charlemagne by his third wife Hildegard. Irene herself broke off the engagement in 788. In 787 Constantine had signed the decrees of the Second Council of Nicaea, but he appears to have had iconoclast sympathies. By then Constantine had turned 16 years old, but his mother did not relinquish executive authority to him. After a conspiracy against Irene was suppressed in the spring of 790 she attempted to get official recognition as empress. This backfired and with military support Constantine finally came to actual power in 790, after the Armeniacs rebelled against Irene. Nevertheless, she was allowed to keep the title of Empress, which was confirmed in 792, and exercise power as a co-ruler with Constantine.. The weakness of Constantine caused dissatisfaction among his supporters. He showed unheroic behaviour after the defeats at the hands of Kardam of Bulgaria in 791 and 792. A movement developed in favor of his uncle, the Caesar Nikephoros. Constantine had his uncle's eyes put out and the tongues of his father's four other half-brothers cut off. His former Armenian supporters revolted after he had blinded their general Alexios Mosele. He crushed this revolt with extreme cruelty in 793. He then divorced his wife Maria of Amnia, who had failed to provide him with a male heir, and married his mistress Theodote, an unpopular and possibly illegal act, although the Patriarch ignored it. By his actions Constantine had lost all support, both of the ruling orthodox and the iconoclast opposition. In 797 Constantine was captured and blinded by the supporters of his mother, who had organized a conspiracy. According to most contemporary accounts, he died from his wounds a few days later, leaving Irene to be crowned as first Empress regnant of Constantinople. Pretenders to the throne claiming to be Constantine VI later appeared during the reign of Michael II.  Irene's sole rule and downfall, 797‚Äì802  Although it is often claimed that, as monarch, Irene called herself \\"basileus\\" (Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµœçœÇ), 'emperor', rather than \\"basilissa\\" (Œ≤Œ±œÉŒØŒªŒπœÉœÉŒ±), 'empress', in fact there are only three instances where it is known that she used the title \\"basileus\\": two legal documents in which she signed herself as \\"Emperor of the Romans\\" and a gold coin of hers found in Sicily bearing the title of \\"basileus\\". In relation to the coin, the lettering is of poor quality and the attribution to Irene may, therefore, be problematic. In reality, she used the title \\"basilissa\\" in all other documents, coins and seals.Liz James, \\"Men, Women, Eunuchs: Gender, Sex, and Power\\" in \\"A Social History of Byzantium\\" (J.

The cities of the empire expanded, and affluence spread across the provinces because of the newfound security. The population rose, and production increased, stimulating new demand while also helping to encourage trade. Culturally, there was considerable growth in education and learning (the \\"Macedonian Renaissance\\"). Ancient texts were preserved and patiently recopied. Byzantine art flourished, and brilliant mosaics graced the interiors of the many new churches. Though the empire was significantly smaller than during the reign of Justinian, it was also stronger, as the remaining territories were both less geographically dispersed and more politically and culturally integrated. Internal developments Although tradition attributed the \\"Byzantine Renaissance\\" to Basil I (867‚Äì886), initiator of the Macedonian dynasty, some later scholars have credited the reforms of Basil's predecessor, Michael III (842‚Äì867) and of the erudite Theoktistos (died 855). The latter in particular favoured culture at the court, and, with a careful financial policy, steadily increased the gold reserves of the Empire. The rise of the Macedonian dynasty coincided with internal developments which strengthened the religious unity of the empire. The iconoclast movement experienced a steep decline: this favoured its soft suppression by the emperors and the reconciliation of the religious strife that had drained the imperial resources in the previous centuries. Despite occasional tactical defeats, the administrative, legislative, cultural and economic situation continued to improve under Basil's successors, especially with Romanos I Lekapenos (920‚Äì944). The theme system reached its definitive form in this period. The Eastern Orthodox Church establishment began to loyally support the imperial cause, and the state limited the power of the landowning class in favour of agricultural small-holders, who made up an important part of the military force of the Empire. These favourable conditions contributed to the increasing ability of the emperors to wage war against the Arabs. Wars against the Muslims By 867, the empire had stabilised its position in both the east and the west, while the success of its defensive military structure had enabled the emperors to begin planning wars of reconquest in the east. Byzantine Empire, c. 867 AD The process of reconquest began with variable fortunes. The temporary reconquest of Crete (843) was followed by a crushing Byzantine defeat on the Bosporus, while the emperors were unable to prevent the ongoing Muslim conquest of Sicily (827‚Äì902). Using present day Tunisia as their launching pad, the Muslims conquered Palermo in 831, Messina in 842, Enna in 859, Syracuse in 878, Catania in 900 and the final Greek stronghold, the fortress of Taormina, in 902. These drawbacks were later counterbalanced by a victorious expedition against Damietta in Egypt (856), the defeat of the Emir of Melitene (863), the confirmation of the imperial authority over Dalmatia (867) and Basil I's offensives towards the Euphrates (870s). The threat from the Arab Muslims was meanwhile reduced by inner struggles and by the rise of the Turks in the east. Muslims received assistance however from the Paulician sect, which had found a large following in the eastern provinces of the Empire and, facing persecution under the Byzantines, often fought under the Arab flag. It took several campaigns to subdue the Paulicians, who were eventually defeated by Basil I. In 904, disaster struck the empire when its second city, Thessaloniki, was sacked by an Arab fleet led by a Byzantine renegade. The Byzantines responded by destroying an Arab fleet in 908, and sacking the city of Laodicea in Syria two years later. Despite this revenge, the Byzantines were still unable to strike a decisive blow against the Muslims, who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces when they attempted to regain Crete in 911. The situation on the border with the Arab territories remained fluid, with the Byzantines alternatively on the offensive or defensive. Kievan Rus', who appeared near Constantinople for the first time in 860, constituted another new challenge. In 941 they appeared on the Asian shore of the Bosporus, but this time they were crushed, showing the improvements in the Byzantine military position after 907, when only diplomacy had been able to push back the invaders. The vanquisher of the Rus' was the famous general John Kourkouas, who continued the offensive with other noteworthy victories in Mesopotamia (943): these culminated in the reconquest of Edessa (944), which was especially celebrated for the return to Constantinople of the venerated Mandylion. The soldier emperors Nikephoros II Phokas (reigned 963‚Äì69) and John I Tzimiskes (969‚Äì76) expanded the empire well into Syria, defeating the emirs of north-west Iraq and reconquering Crete and Cyprus. At one point under John, the empire's armies even threatened Jerusalem, far to the south. The emirate of Aleppo and its neighbours became vassals of the empire in the east, where the greatest threat to the empire was the Egyptian Fatimid kingdom. Wars against Bulgaria Emperor Basil II the Bulgar Slayer (976‚Äì1025). The traditional struggle with the See of Rome continued, spurred by the question of religious supremacy over the newly Christianized Bulgaria. This prompted an invasion by the powerful Tsar Simeon I in 894, but this was pushed back by the Byzantine diplomacy, which called on the help of the Hungarians. The Byzantines were in turn defeated, however, at the Battle of Bulgarophygon (896), and obliged to pay annual subsidies to the Bulgarians. Later (912) Simeon even had the Byzantines grant him the crown of basileus of Bulgaria and had the young emperor Constantine VII marry one of his daughters. When a revolt in Constantinople halted his dynastic project, he again invaded Thrace and conquered Adrianople. A great imperial expedition under Leo Phokas and Romanos Lekapenos ended again with a crushing Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Anchialus (917), and the following year the Bulgarians ravaged modern-day northern Greece south to Corinth. Adrianople was captured again in 923 and in 924 the Bulgarian army laid siege to Constantinople. Pressure from the North was alleviated only after Simeon's death in 927. Under the emperor Basil II (reigned 976‚Äì1025), Bulgaria became target of annual campaigns by the Byzantine army. The war was to drag on for nearly twenty years, but eventually at the Battle of Kleidon the Bulgarian forces were completely defeated. and captured. According to medieval legends 99 out of every 100 Bulgarian soldiers were blinded and the remaining hundredth man was left with one eye so as to lead his compatriots home; reportedly when the aging Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria saw the remains of his once formidable army, he died of heart attack. In 1018 Bulgaria surrendered and became part of the Byzantine Empire thus restoring the Danube frontier, which had not been held since the days of Heraclius. During this period the Byzantine princess Theophanu, wife of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II, served as regent of the Holy Roman Empire, paving the way for the westward spread of Byzantine culture. Relations with Kievan Rus' Prince Oleg leads a squadron of horse-driven boats to the walls of Tsargrad. A medieval Kievan Rus' illumination (907) Between 800 and 1100 the empire developed a mixed relationship with the new state of Kievan Rus' that emerged to the north across the Black Sea. The Byzantine Empire quickly became a main trading and cultural partner for Kiev. After Christianizing, Rus' Vladimir the Great employed many architects and artists to work on numerous cathedrals and churches around Rus', expanding the Byzantine influence even further. Kievan Rus' princes were often married into the Byzantine imperial family and Constantinople often employed princes' armies; most notably, Vladimir the Great presented Byzantium with the famous Varangian Guard ‚Äì an army of vicious Scandinavian mercenaries. Some believe that this was in exchange for the marriage to Basil's sister Anna to Vladimir. However, the Primary Chronicle states the marriage was in exchange for the Rus' conversion to orthodoxy; the Varangian Guard was a by-product (although a significant one) of this exchange. The relationship was not always friendly. During this three hundred year interval Constantinople and other Byzantine cities were attacked several times by the armies of Kievan Rus' (see Rus'-Byzantine Wars). Kiev never went far enough to actually endanger the empire; the wars were primarily a tool to force the Byzantines to sign increasingly favorable trade treaties, the texts of which are recorded in the Primary Chronicle (Rus'‚ÄìByzantine Treaty (907)) Prince Oleg's Campaign Against Constantinople and other historical documents. Constantinople at the same time constantly pitted Kievan Rus', Bulgaria, and Poland against each other. The Byzantine influence on Kievan Rus' cannot be overestimated. Byzantine-style writing became a standard for the adopted from Bulgaria Cyrillic alphabet, Byzantine architecture dominated in Kiev, and as a main trading partner the Byzantine Empire played a critical role in the establishment, rise, and fall of Kievan Rus'. Triumph themata of the Byzantine Empire at the death of Basil II in 1025. The Byzantine Empire now stretched to Armenia in the east, to Calabria in Southern Italy in the west. Many successes had been achieved, ranging from the conquest of Bulgaria, to the annexation of parts of Georgia and Armenia, to the total annihilation of an invading force of Egyptians outside Antioch. Yet even these victories were not enough; Basil considered the continued Arab occupation of Sicily to be an outrage. Accordingly, he planned to reconquer the island, which had belonged to the empire for over three hundred years (c. 550 ‚Äì c. 900). However, his death in 1025 put an end to the project. The 11th century was also momentous for its religious events. In 1054, relations between Greek and Slavic-speaking Eastern and Latin-speaking Western Christian traditions reached a terminal crisis. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday afternoon and placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was a culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Although the schism was brought about by doctrinal disputes (in particular, Eastern refusal to accept the Western Church doctrine of the filioque, or double procession of the Holy Spirit), disputes over administration and political issues had simmered for centuries. The formal separation of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Western Catholic Church would have wide-ranging consequences for the future of Europe and Christianity.

She frequently appears as a television presenter, stars in commercials, plays in various movies, and becomes an impromptu singer.  Early life  Born in Antananarivo, Madagascar to expatriate Indonesian parents of ethnic Minangkabau origin hailing from Pariaman, West Sumatra, where her father, Zubir Amin was working as a senior diplomat with the Indonesian Embassy in that country. Her name was a special given one from the Malagasy language and was registered at birth as Nirina Raudhatul Jannah Zubir. Zubir graduated from the STIE Perbanas School of Economics. She eventually looked for other options as soon as graduation. She admitted to never imagine in becoming a radio DJ. Her first career at MTVonSky radio station (now MTV Sky) was a coincidence. According to Zubir, it was her friends who applied to MTVonSky under her name. Her friends' move turned into a major change in her life. Quite beyond her expectations, MTVonSky hired Zubir because of her distinctive noisy-yet-witty personality. ‚ÄúSo there was my [first] opportunity [in the entertainment world].‚Äù That first opportunity had led Zubir to bigger and better things. After landing one of the coolest jobs around ‚Äî MTV video jockey ‚Äî Zubir quickly gained fame. Her other talents were then noticed, including her ability to speak Mandarin, which she learned while living in Hong Kong and China for several years as a child. Former president Megawati Sukarnoputri even asked Nirina to become her personal interpreter during the 2000 Indonesian visit by the Chinese vice president. Her popularity then led to some movie roles, including in 30 Hari Mencari Cinta (30 Days to Find Love) and Mirror. And it wouldn‚Äôt be Nirina if she didn‚Äôt have plenty of things to pursue. Her rising popularity as an MTV VJ for Indonesia tickled her ambitious side to think of spreading her wings onto the international scene. As her contract with MTV Indonesia neared its end, Nirina made plans: She was eyeing the position of international VJ for MTV Southeast Asia. ‚ÄúThe thing is, I wouldn‚Äôt give up on that. Not until they told me: ‚ÄòEnough, ‚ÄòNa [short for Nirina]‚Äô,\\" she once said of her ambitious plan. The ambitious plan was never realized. After resigning from MTV Indonesia in 2005, Nirina‚Äôs international VJ career never materialized. Instead, she hosted several TV shows and starred in more movies, including Belahan Jiwa (Soul Mate), Heart, Kamulah Satu- satunya (You‚Äôre the Only One), Get Married and again in her latest release, Get Married 2. Nirina has continued to grow as an actress, receiving several awards, including the prestigious 2006 Indonesian Film Festival Award and the 2008 Indonesia Movie Award ‚Äî both for best actress. Looking back at her achievements, Nirina realizes now how she truly fell in love with performing arts. Zubir studied for a degree in bachelor's degree in Management Banking at the STIE Perbanas Kuningan, in Jakarta before beginning as a model. She is fluent in her native Indonesian, and in English and Chinese. She made her full film debut in 2004 in the film 30 hari mencari cinta playing the role of Gwen.

His Christian name was Conrad Victor, and he filled the position of professor of the classic languages at the University of Marburg. Finding it impossible to accept the dogma of the Trinity and of the divinity of Jesus, he went, in 1607, to Salonica, where he embraced Judaism, assuming the name of Moses Prado. After a residence of seven years in that city he began to solicit permission from the Duke of Hesse to return to Marburg, where he had left his wife. In a series of letters addressed by him to an old friend at Marburg named Hartmann, Moses justifies himself for embracing Judaism. The truth of Judaism, he declares, is beyond question, since both the Muslims and the Christians are compelled to acknowledge it. He only asks the Duke of Hesse to show himself as tolerant as the sultan, who grants freedom of conscience to every man. The desired permission was refused, and Moses remained at Salonica until his death.

In the 2000s, the Goldington Middle School was inspected an Outstanding school (OfSTED April 2007) was awarded the Artsmark award and was also designated as a Beacon School. Plans made by Bedford Borough Council to implement a two-tier education system in the Borough were withdrawn for most Bedford Borough schools following a decision by the coalition government in 2010 to cancel the Building Schools for the Future Project (BSF) and withdraw associated funding. Most of the closure notices that had been served on Bedford Borough middle schools were revoked in February 2011, including that for Goldington Middle School. To protect the school from closure in the future the Governing Body, following consultation with stakeholders, took the decision to apply to the Secretary of State for Education to convert to an academy. This application was accepted and the school became Goldington Academy on 1 April 2011. The opening celebration assembly was attended by local MP, Richard Fuller.

Allan Pinkerton, founder of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, played a key role by managing Lincoln's security throughout the journey. Though scholars debate whether or not the threat was real, clearly Lincoln and his advisors believed that there was a threat and took actions to ensure his safe passage through Baltimore, Maryland. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, a Republican, and the first to be elected from that party. Shortly after his election, many representatives of southern states made it clear that the Confederacy's secession from the U.S. was inevitable, which greatly increased tension across the nation. A plot to assassinate Lincoln in Baltimore was alleged, and he ultimately arrived secretly in Washington, D.C. on February 23, 1861. A planned train route through Bellaire, Ohio, to Wheeling, Virginia (West Virginia had yet to break off from Virginia) and eastward, was subsequently rerouted up through the Pittsburgh vicinity, through Pennsylvania, into Maryland and eventually to Washington. For the remainder of his presidency, Lincoln's many critics would hound him for the seemingly cowardly act of sneaking through Baltimore at night, in disguise, sacrificing his honor for his personal safety. However, the efforts at security may well have been prudent. Background Allan Pinkerton was commissioned by the railroad to provide security for the president-elect on his journey to Washington, D.C. Maryland was a slave state with strong Southern sympathies and therefore potentially dangerous for the Republican president-elect to pass through. Two months following his journey, Baltimore citizens attacked a Union Army regiment from Massachusetts as it marched through the city on its way to Washington. When Virginia seceded and joined the Confederacy, it became necessary for Lincoln to cross Maryland to reach Washington. The incoming Republican government was not about to take risks, and later that year Lincoln would suspend many civil liberties, even ordering the arrest of Maryland's state legislature for fear it might vote for secession. Pinkerton, in particular, was overly cautious, which he would demonstrate during the coming war, when he repeatedly overestimated Confederate strength and negatively influenced Union Army policy. Lincoln's actions Portrait of Allan Pinkerton from Harper's Weekly, 1884 On February 11, 1861, President-elect Lincoln boarded an east-bound train in Springfield, Illinois at the start of a whistle-stop tour of 70 towns and cities ending with his inauguration in Washington, D.C. Allan Pinkerton had been hired by railroad officials to investigate suspicious activities and acts of destruction of railroad property along Lincoln's route through Baltimore. Pinkerton became convinced that a plot existed to ambush Lincoln's carriage between the Calvert Street Station of the Northern Central Railway and the Camden Station of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This opportunity would present itself during the President-elect's passage through Baltimore on February 23, 1861. Pinkerton tried to persuade Lincoln to cancel his stop at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and proceed secretly straight through Baltimore, but Lincoln insisted upon keeping to his schedule. Abraham Lincoln arriving in Washington with his valet and bodyguard William H. Johnson (left hand corner), 1861. Lincoln, Johnson, and detectives traveled a secret route from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C. to prevent an assassination attempt. Pinkerton famously clashed with Lincoln's friend and escort, Ward Hill Lamon, over the President-elect's protection. Lamon offered Lincoln \\"a Revolver and a Bowie Knife\\" but Pinkerton protested that he \\"would not for the world have it said that Mr. Lincoln had to enter the National Capitol armed.\\"Cuthbert, N: Lincoln and the Baltimore Plot, 1861, page 79. Huntington Library, 1949. On the evening of February 22, telegraph lines to Baltimore were cut at Pinkerton's behest to prevent communications from passing between potential conspirators in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Meanwhile, Lincoln left Harrisburg on a special train and arrived secretly in Baltimore in the middle of the night. The most dangerous link in the journey was in Baltimore, where a city ordinance prohibited night-time rail travel through the downtown area. Therefore, the railcars had to be horsedrawn between the President Street and Camden Street stations. According to Pinkerton, a captain of the roads reported that there was a plot to stab the President-elect. The alleged plan was to have several assassins, armed with knives, interspersed throughout the crowd that would gather to greet Lincoln at the President Street station. When Lincoln emerged from the car, which he had to do to change trains, at least one of the assassins would be able to get close enough to kill him. Once Lincoln's rail carriage had safely passed through Baltimore, Pinkerton sent a one-line telegram to the president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad: \\"Plums delivered nuts safely.\\" The crowd waiting for Lincoln was disappointed. On the afternoon of February 23, Lincoln's scheduled train arrived at Calvert Street Station Road to Lincoln's end ran through Baltimore, Jonathan M. Pitts, The Baltimore Sun in Baltimore. The large crowd that gathered at the station to see the president-elect quickly learned that Lincoln had already passed by. Even though the rest of the Lincoln party, including Mrs. Lincoln and the children, had been on this train as originally scheduled, they had already alighted from the train in an unscheduled stop several blocks north of the President Street station.Scharf, John, History of Maryland vol.III, Tradition Press, p.39 =People associated with the plot= *Harry W.

President-elect Lincoln depicted ignominiously hiding in a cattle car by Adalbert J. Volck, 1863. Vanity Fair, March 9, 1861 Many historians believe that Pinkerton's perception of an assassination plot was incorrect, and Lincoln came to regret that he had slipped through the city unannounced. Many years after the fact, Ward Hill Lamon would publicly argue that there had been no plot to assassinate the president in 1861. \\"It is perfectly manifest that there was no conspiracy‚Äîno conspiracy of a hundred, of fifty, of twenty, of three; no definite purpose in the heart of even one man to murder Mr. Lincoln in Baltimore.\\"Lamon, W: Life of Abraham Lincoln, p. 513. James R. Osgood and Company, 1872. In the 1891 book Recollections of President Lincoln and his Administration, author L.E. Chittenden argues that there was no need for any precautions, such as a disguise, because Lincoln \\"entered the sleeping‚Äìcar at Philadelphia, and slept until awakened within a few miles of Washington.\\" That account contradicts other firsthand accounts, which state that Lincoln spent a sleepless and anxious night with Lamon and Pinkerton, during which he \\"spoke in a quiet voice to avoid being noticed.\\"Harris, William C., Lincoln's Rise to the Presidency. (Lawrence:University of Kansas Press, 2007), 318. Whether or not the president-elect was ever in any real danger of being assassinated, Lincoln's efforts to reach Washington, D.C., safely instantly became a humiliating cause c√©l√®bre across the nation, much to his chagrin. Several elements of the initial February 23, 1861 article in The New York Times were especially damning. Primarily, the fact that such a negative report came from an ardently Republican newspaper gave it instant credibility,Harper p. 90 much more than it would have enjoyed if it had come from a Copperhead or Southern source. When The New York Times published Joseph Howard, Jr.'s account of the President-elect disguised in a scotch-cap and long cloak, the nation \\"rocked with laughter, bringing abuse and ridicule down on Lincoln.\\"Holzer, Harold, Lincoln Seen & Heard. (University Press of Kansas, 2000.) (p. 118) \\"Flight of Abraham\\", Harper's Weekly, March 9, 1861. Substantively, the Howard article was a direct assault on Lincoln's manliness. The article states that Lincoln was reluctant and too scared and to go but compelled to go by Colonel Sumner's indignation and by the insistence and shame of his wife and several others.Harper p. 89 The newspapers lampooned Lincoln for slipping through Baltimore in the dead of night. Adalbert J. Volck, a Baltimore dentist and caricaturist, was inspired to pen his famous satirical etching \\"Passage through Baltimore\\". Volck's image of a startled Lincoln in his nightshirt peering out of the side of his rail car as it passes through Baltimore has become part of the Lincoln iconography. \\"In the nineteenth century, when pictures were less common and more prized, the scotch-cap symbol remained a prop in Confederate graphics, and some Northern- made prints as well, for years‚Äîthe reminder of Lincoln fleeing in disguise an automatic accusation of his supposed lack of character.\\"Holzer, p. 118 For the rest of his presidency, the story of his sneaking like a coward through Baltimore would be told and retold by his enemies, with particular effect by cartoonists of the day. He was drawn with many variations of Scottish headwear, which eventually morphed into a Scottish balmoral cap and very short kilt. The absurd disguise was often accompanied by a terrified expression on the President-elect's face, to further undermine the public's image of his courage and manliness. Images such as a comic strip in Harper's Weekly plagued Lincoln throughout his presidency. Newspapers of all parties mocked Lincoln's actions. In a Vanity Fair cartoon, the kilt was traded for a dress the president had borrowed from his wife. By the time that Lincoln arrived in Washington, he was the laughing stock of the entire country. The New York Tribune was nonetheless forced to admit, \\"It is the only instance recorded in our history in which the recognized head of a nation ... has been compelled, for fear of his life, to enter the capital in disguise.\\" More blunt was the denunciation by the Baltimore Sun: > Had we any respect for Mr. Lincoln, official or personal, as a man, or as > President-elect of the United States ... the final escapade by which he > reached the capital would have utterly demolished it ... He might have > entered Willard's Hotel with a \\"head spring\\" and a \\"summersault,\\" and the > clown's merry greeting to Gen. Scott, \\"Here we are!\\" and we should care > nothing about it, personally. We do not believe the Presidency can ever be > more degraded by any of his successors than it has by him, even before his > inauguration. In popular culture In 1951, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) released a fictional re-creation of the alleged plot against Lincoln, The Tall Target. Its story generally follows what is known about the Baltimore Plot, with some differences. It is a New York Police Department detective named John Kennedy, played by Dick Powell, who contacts the administration about the conspiracy and boards the train hoping to discover whether any of the plotters are on board before they reach Baltimore. Kennedy discovers a plot that involves a riot to distract police protection away from Lincoln and a sharpshooter armed with a rifle with a telescopic sight to shoot the president-elect. Through Kennedy's efforts, the attempt is aborted and key members of the conspiracy are identified. There actually was an NYPD officer, John Alexander Kennedy, who claimed to have been the one who uncovered the Baltimore Plot; but, unlike Powell's movie character, he was not actually on scene. Moreover, in real life, Kennedy was the superintendent of the entire force. In the film, he is simply a detective sergeant. \\"The Death Trap,\\" an episode of the 1966‚Äì1967 television series The Time Tunnel, includes the 1861 Baltimore plot, but it also depicts a brief difficulty with the time machine that caused the showing of an enactment of the April 14, 1865 shooting of Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington. The episode depicts a bomb being used in the 1861 Baltimore plot and has the attempt being plotted by Abolitionists, who hope to plunge the nation into a war in which slavery will be ended; the plotters are apparent sympathizers with John Brown, who had already been hanged. In reality, the American Civil War actually began in April 1861, with the attack on Fort Sumter.

However, after her death believers from different branches of Protestantism have often referred to her as a victim of religious persecutions and a martyr.Janusz Tazbir, op.cit. pp. 86‚Äì87 Aftermath The burning of Catherine was a surprising incident in Poland, which, in the 16th century, ranked among the countries with the highest degree of religious tolerance.

In 1928 he was a member of the University of Toronto Grads, the Canadian team which won the gold medal. He also played NHL hockey for the Montreal Maroons in the 1932‚Äì33 season. After retiring from hockey, Plaxton qualified as a lawyer and entered politics. He was elected to parliament in the 1935 federal election as a Liberal MP from the Toronto riding of Trinity defeating Minister of Justice and former Toronto mayor George Reginald Geary. He lost the Liberal Party nomination in 1940 federal election to former Ontario Attorney-General Arthur Roebuck but attempted to return to Parliament in the 1945 federal election running in the riding of Kingston City where he was defeated by Conservative Thomas Kidd. In January 1937, Plaxton introduced a resolution in the House of Commons of Canada to propose the establishment of a Canadian ministry of sports. He stated it had potential to take over administration of sports and eliminate \\"disputes over authority and jurisdiction\\". Amateur Athletic Union of Canada president Jack Hamilton felt that the ministry might be beneficial, and that sport could be promoted with the help of department of health and reach more areas of Canada. He wanted more discussion on what would happen to sports organizations if the government took control or organized sports, but stated that the AAU of C would co-operate. Plaxton was one of two former hockey players to have been elected a Member of Parliament for Trinity, the other being Lionel Conacher who was elected as a Liberal MP for the riding in 1949 and 1953.

Christian Adolph Klotz (13 November 1738 ‚Äì 31 December 1771) was a German philologist and controversialist. He is a notable representative of the transition period between the Age of Enlightenment and Sturm und Drang.Achim Aurnhammer: Torquato Tasso in Deutschland, Walter de Gruyter, 1995 Education Klotz, son of a senior church official, was born in Bischofswerda, Lusatia. He attended the gymnasium in Mei√üen and G√∂rlitz. From 1758 until 1760, he studied at the University of Leipzig. In these years, he was already publishing his first philological works. Then he moved to the University of Jena, where he wrote polemic papers against Pieter Burman the Younger. Klotz defended his dissertation, qualified as a lecturer, and held lectures about Horace at Jena. Career In 1762 he obtained the position of an associate professor and in 1763 that of a full professor from the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1765 Klotz moved to Halle, where he served as professor of philosophy and eloquence (). There he became very popular for his literary creations and exerted a significant influence on the contemporary taste and thinking. Johann Georg Jacobi was among his supporters. Klotz published in various literary journals, among them Acta Litteraria, and introduced his students to Italian poetry as of Torquato Tasso. He got into controversy with the Allgemeinen Bibliothek, to which he had contributed. In 1766 Klotz was appointed aulic counsellor (\\"Hofrat\\") by the king, after he had refused a call to Warsaw. In 1769 he helped Karl Friedrich Bahrdt obtain the chair of biblical antiquities in the philosophical faculty at Erfurt. Bahrdt, like Klotz, came from Bischofswerda, and two years earlier scandals in Bahrdt's private life had led to his dismissal. Klotz' strength was his ability to cover a wide range of topics and his aesthetic as well as enjoyable style, both in Latin and German. As his weakness, however, critics identified sometimes the lack of depth and originality of his thinking. Johann Gottfried Herder and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing became known as his most influential opponents. Klotz' work Ueber den Nutzen und Gebrauch der alten geschnittenen Steine (1768) criticizing Lessing's Laokoon, had brought forth that poet's response in the Briefe antiquarischen Inhalts (1768‚Äì69). Klotz died in Halle in 1771. Works He proved himself expert in philology through his Latin poems (collected in Opuscula poetica, 1766), Der Ausgabe des Tyrt√§os (1764), and numerous treatises such as Opuscula varii argumenti (1766) and Opuscula philologica et oratoria (1772). His disputes were carried on in Acta Literaria and Deutschen Bibliothek der sch√∂nen Wissenschaften (1767‚Äì72), both of which he edited along with Neuen Hallischen gelehrten Zeitungen. Genius Saeculi (1760), Mores Eruditorum and Opuscula Latina (1760) were written with satirical ends. Other works were Vindiciae Horatianae (1764), Lectiones Venusinae (1771), and an edition of Marco Girolamo Vida's De Arte Poetica (1776).

The alleged estate was said to include 1,900 acres of land, 228 acres of which ran through the center of Wilmington, worth up to $150,000,000. Other claims included $100,000,000 deposited in a Stockholm bank.Delaware Federal Writers' Project. US History Publishers, 1948, Delaware, a guide to the first State, pp. 276-7. It is notable today primarily as the result of mistaken reliance on the various fraudulent and/or erroneous Springer genealogies going back to Adam and Eve via Emperor Charlemagne. Wilmington's supposed debt was related to land purportedly owned by Springer. The land actually had belonged to Old Swedes' Church. Springer was merely a life trustee for the land. The tie to Sweden was based on a phony genealogy used to claim that Springer was part of the Swedish Aristocracy.\\"Haunted Delaware: Ghosts And Strange Phenomena of the First State\\". Patricia A. Martinelli, Stackpole Books, 2006. . In one version of the scam from the 1850s, people claiming to be Springer heirs sold stock in the \\"Springer Heirs Corporation\\", supposedly to file court cases to prove their alleged ownership of large sections of real estate in the downtown area of Wilmington, Delaware or the royal jewels of Sweden. The corporation folded after a few minor court cases for several small, unclaimed estates. A later version of the scam was started in 1913, targeting actual and possible descendants of Springer. Again, the estate was said to hold legitimate title to large sections of land in Wilmington.

The project combines a hardback book (conceived, written and illustrated by Woodroffe) and a double vinyl album of music (written and performed by Greenslade). The title means, approximately, 'the first five books (pentateuch) of the creation (cosmogony)'. Woodroffe's artwork is heavily inspired by The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/patrick-woodroffe-fantasy- artist-who-illustrated-science-fiction-books-and-album-covers-9647922.html The story and artwork within 'Pentateuch' are framed as a document discovered within an abandoned spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter. As such, both the plot and prose follow the conventions of religious lore, even as it incorporates science fiction elements such as apocalyptic environmental disaster and interstellar travel in its second half. A combinatorial ideographic script is used throughout the artwork. Greenslade contributed the 74 minutes of music as his second solo project. Like the story and artwork, the music is framed as the work of the alien race which built the spacecraft. To maintain this image of otherworldly origin, it was recorded almost entirely with electronic musical instruments. A CD reissue was released in 1994, transferring Woodroffe's 12\\" x 12\\" book into a 5\\" square booklet. In order to keep the double album within the constraints of a single CD, the end of one track is faded out early. The story was retold without music in Woodroffe's 1987 book The Second Earth.

In 1686‚Äì87, he worked for two printers of Amsterdam, but from 1690 to 1694 seems to have owned a printing establishment and to have printed several Hebrew books, including his own Judeo-German translation of Hannover's Yewen Mezulah.

In 1709, Moses established a printing-office in the German town of Halle, where in 1712 he printed his Tela'ot Moshe (or \\"Weltbeschreibung\\"), a Judeo- German work on the Ten Tribes, having collected the material from a number of sources, particularly from Abraham Farissol and Gedaliah ibn Yahya. He continued printing in Halle until 1714, in which year he printed Tefillat Moshe, a prayer-book, and Berechiah Berakh's Zera' Berak. Owing to anti- Christian passages in these two works, his printing-office was closed by royal order. He was imprisoned, and his books were confiscated. His coreligionists, however, helped him to escape to Amsterdam, where he printed in the same year (1714) Mesechtas Rosh ha-Shanah. He died in Amsterdam in 1733 or 1734.

Retiring from active life in 1780, he occupied himself with religious studies, and then began his conversion to Judaism. He began to observe the Sabbath and the dietary laws; then he circumcised himself; and on the Day of Atonement in 1785 he attended services in the Jewish synagogue dressed in a white attire, like other worshipers. When the authorities were informed of Steblicki's conversion, proceedings against him were immediately instituted which, according to the law of Leopold I, of 1709, then still in force, should have led to a sentence of death. But the king, Frederick II, ordered the proceedings to be suspended (Dec. 12), and left to the revenue authorities the questions as to whether Steblicki, as a Jew without right of residence (\\"unvergleiteter Jude\\"), should be tolerated, and whether he should be required to pay the special Jewish taxes. On July 28, 1786, the authorities decided that he should not be charged, on the ground that he must be mentally unbalanced. Steblicki lived more than twenty years after his conversion in harmony with his wife and his son, and was highly respected by the small Jewish community of Nikolai. He died there on May 16, 1807. His life was made the subject of legendary exaggerations in David Samosez's Ger Zedek (Breslau, 1816) and in M. A. Hertzberg's Der Neuc Jude (Gleiwitz, 1845).

While other forms of the brandy sour cocktail exist, the Cypriot variety is a distinct mixture, which only shares the basic brandy and lemon flavourings with other variants. Both brandy and lemons are among Cyprus's major exports, and both have distinctive Cypriot characteristics.  History  The Cypriot brandy sour style was developed following the introduction of the first blended brandy made on Cyprus, by the Haggipavlu family, in the early 1930s. The cocktail was developed at the Forest Park Hotel, in the hill-resort of Pl√°tres, for the young King Farouk of Egypt, who often stayed at the hotel during his frequent visits to the island. The brandy sour was introduced as an alcoholic substitute for iced tea, as a way of disguising the Muslim monarch's preference for Western-style cocktails. The drink subsequently spread to other bars and hotels in the fashionable Platres area, before making its way to the coastal resorts of Limassol, Paphos and Kyrenia, and the capital Nicosia.  Recipe and ingredients  A typical recipe for a Cypriot brandy sour includes: *5 cl (2 parts) Cypriot brandy (typically KEO VSOP or Haggipavlu Anglias brands) *2.5 cl (1 part) Cypriot lemon squash *2‚Äì4 drops of bitters (Angostura or Cypriot Cock Drops brands) *Top up with soda water (some use lemonade instead) *Ice Cocktail brandy produced in Cyprus is typically less strongly flavoured than cognac or armagnac, and most brands have a caramel-biased aftertaste balance. Cyprus also produces distinctive, yellow-green coloured, bitter lemons ‚Äî used by British author Lawrence Durrell for the title for his autobiographical novel Bitter Lemons of Cyprus. These lemons are used locally to produce a bitter- sweet lemon cordial, which forms the sour and bitter base for the brandy sour cocktail. Bitters are added to taste, and while the locally produced Cock Drops brand is widely available on the island, the internationally recognised Angostura brand is increasingly used. These ingredients are added to a tall glass and stirred, before the glass is topped up with lemonade (for a classic, slightly sweeter drink) or soda water (for less sweetness and a more pronounced brandy flavour), and plenty of ice.

(The applied radial force is depicted by the green arrow. The arrow's counterclockwise rotation depicts the direction of precession, while the direction of rotation is shown by the clockwise rotation of the blue square. The center of the blue square is traversing counterclockwise along a small circle, the orbit, of diameter equal to the difference of the diameters of the red circle and the blue circle, even though the blue square rotates clockwise). If the blue circle has a diameter d and the red circle a diameter d + Œ¥. The instant the green arrow is pointing downwards, the blue circle is pressed against the red circle at the bottom (point A on the blue circle). The force rotating counterclockwise causes the blue circle to roll around the red circle clockwise. When it has rolled a distance œÄd, the circumference of the blue circle, point A again touches the red circle. Since the circumference of the red circle is œÄ(d + Œ¥), point A touches the red circle a distance œÄŒ¥ clockwise from the bottom. Precession, also called epicyclic fretting precession, (or more accurately hypocyclic fretting precession since \\"epicyclic\\" applies to a round part spinning outside a circle and \\"hypocyclic\\" applies to a round part spinning inside a circle) is the process of a round part in a round hole rotating with respect to that hole because of clearance between them and a radial force on the part that changes direction. The direction of rotation of the inner part is opposite to the direction of rotation of the radial force. Fretting between the part and the hole is often a result of this motion. \\"In machinery, fretting is the micro- motion of tightly fitting parts that superficially appear immobile with respect to each other.\\" \\"For a pedal, a rotating load arises from downward pedaling force on a spindle rotating with its crank making the predominantly downward force effectively rotate about the pedal spindle. What may be less evident is that even tightly fitting parts have relative clearance due to their elasticity, metals not being rigid materials as is evident from steel springs. Under load, micro deformations, enough to cause motion, occur in such joints. This can be seen from wear marks where pedal spindles seat on crank faces.\\" This precession is a process purely due to contact forces and does not depend on inertia and is not inversely proportional to spin rate. It is completely unrelated to torque-free and torque-induced precession. Examples Precession caused by fretting can cause fastenings under large torque loads to unscrew themselves. =Automobile lug nuts= Automobiles have also used left-threaded lug nuts on left-side wheels, but now commonly use tapered lug nuts, which do not precess. =Bicycle pedals= Bicycle pedals are left-threaded on the left-hand crank so that precession tightens the pedal rather than loosening it. This may seem counter-intuitive, but the torque exerted due to the precession is several orders of magnitude greater than that caused by a jammed pedal bearing. Shimano SPD axle units, which can be unscrewed from the pedal body for servicing, have a left-hand thread where the axle unit screws into the right-hand pedal; the opposite case to the pedal- crank interface. Otherwise precession of the pedal body around the axle would tend to unscrew one from the other. =Bicycle bottom brackets= English threaded bicycle bottom brackets are left-threaded on the right-hand (usually drive) side into the bottom bracket shell. This is the opposite of pedals into cranks because the sense of the relative motion between the parts is opposite. (Italian and French threaded bottom brackets have right-hand threading on both sides.) =Bicycle sprockets= Splined sprockets precess against any lockring which is screwed into the freehub. Shimano uses a lockring with detents to hold cassette sprockets in place, and this resists precession. Sturmey-Archer once used 12-splined sprockets for 2- and 3-speed racing hubs, and these were secured with a left-threaded lockring for the same reason. (Fixed gear bicycles also use a left-threaded lockring but this is not because of precession; it is merely to ensure that the lockring tends to tighten, should the sprocket begin to unscrew.) =Bearings in manual transmissions= A bearing supported gear in a manual transmission rotates synchronously with its shaft due to the dog-gear engagement. In this case, the small diametrical clearance in the bearing will induce precession of the roller group relative to the gear mitigating any fretting that occurs if the same bearing rollers always push against the same spot on the gear. Typically the 4th and 5th gears will have precession inducing features, while 1st through 3rd gears might not since cars spend less time in those gears. Transmission failure due to lack of precession is possible in gear boxes when low gears are engaged for long periods of time.

It is part of Austin Public Schools, established in 1857. The home of the Packers, the school has over 1,250 students; AHS prides itself on having strong academics, athletics, and fine arts. The school colors are Scarlet and White, and the sports team is the Packers. AHS is a member of the Big 9 Conference. Austin High School. Shown here is the 1919 building and the main entrance to the 1939 addition, which continues to the left. School layout Austin High School was primarily constructed in two phases. The older section, c. 1919, has Christgau Hall in the center, while the \\"new\\" building, c. 1939, is built around Knowlton Auditorium and Ove Berven Gym. The back of the auditorium stage is directly connected with the north end of the gym and they are divided by a (formerly movable) wall, with the cafeteria in the basement below. Classrooms are on the outside of each ring, with the overall effect being the shape of a figure-eight. Stairwells are at each outer corner, midway along the \\"new\\" building, and at either end of the hall where the \\"new\\" and \\"old\\" buildings meet. There is also an interior pair of stairwells that access the commons (main lobby), mid-floor classrooms and offices, and Knowlton Auditorium's balcony. A feature of the main building is a commons area that includes vending machines and social area with student artwork on display, the cashier's office, counseling office, and Health Services (nurse) office. The Annex is a separate building situated west of the main building, across 4th Street NW. Built in the 1950s, it originally housed the vocational programs and Austin State Jr. College. The college moved to its current location in 1966. Classes in the Annex include Auto Shop, Carpentry, Tech Explorations, Graphics, Welding, Woodworking, Choir, Band, and Orchestra. A tunnel connects the main building to the Annex, allowing students to pass between buildings without crossing 4th Street. The school has three floors, each represented by a different color: first floor is red, second is green, and the third floor is blue. Most freshman classes are on the third floor, while the rest of the classes are organized by each education department (Language Arts, Social Studies, Mathematics and Science). The basement contains the cafeteria, a tunnel system for pedestrian traffic which was remodeled into storage, and a section that originally contained a four-lane pool. After the swimming teams moved to a new facility at Ellis Middle School in the early 1970s, the pool was only used for Phy Ed classes. The pool was closed and the section was remodeled into classroom and storage space after the Ellis fire of 1986. Pool The school is served with three gyms: Packer Gym, Hastings Gym, and Ove Berven Gym. Packer and Hastings Gyms are adjacent to each other in the 1991 addition built at the south end of the \\"new\\" building, with a door that connects the two gyms. Their locker rooms are along the hall running beside the two gyms. Ove Berven locker rooms are two levels each and located in the southwest and northeast corners adjacent to the gym, with each having a level on the ground floor and in the basement. In the Annex, there is also a locker room, a weight training room and a gym used in the past for wrestling practice. There are three auditoriums on campus: Knowlton Auditorium (capacity 1,850) is the largest, located on the first floor and having access to the balcony using the central stairwells and second and third floor entries. Christgau Hall (capacity 400) is located on the second floor of the original building with access to the balcony on the third floor. The Annex Auditorium is located in the tunnel leading to the Annex, and is better described as a lecture hall seating about 100. A second annex building, on the west side of Fourth Street NW between the main annex and Pacelli High School, is the maintenance shop and physical plant for the school and contains no student activities.

Formerly known as Lake City Municipal Airport, it is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility.  History  =NAS Lake City= The airport was originally built by the U.S. Navy during World War II to facilitate pilot training and named Naval Air Station Lake City. Commissioned in December 1942, NAS Lake City was located on the site of the Lake City Flying Club air field east of town. Established as one of several support facilities to NAS Jacksonville, NAS Lake City was used to train U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps pilots in land-based PV-1 Venturas and PV-2 Harpoons. Maximum complement at the air station reached 290 officers and 1,150 enlisted personnel. As many as 200 additional officer and enlisted WAVES were stationed at NAS Lake City later in the war and served in air traffic control, meteorological services, administrative support, and aircraft maintenance. The airfield southeast of Lake Butler served as an outlying field (OLF) and Cedar Key, Alachua and Gainesville provided auxiliary fields. Regular military operations terminated in March 1946 and NAS Lake City was decommissioned as an active naval air station. =Lake City Municipal Airport= The NAS Lake City property was deemed surplus and subsequently conveyed to the city of Lake City by the General Services Administration and renamed Lake City Municipal Airport. One of the first major tenants was Aero Corporation, which occupied the vacated military hangars and maintenance facilities, performing aircraft modification and rehabilitation during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, mostly U.S. military contracts supporting C-130 Hercules and P-3 Orion aircraft. Aero Corporation was subsequently acquired by TIMCO, which was then acquired by HAECO. the current tenant, which performs depot level maintenance on Boeing and Airbus commercial aircraft. =Lake City Gateway Airport= In 2011, the airport completed construction of a new 6,000 square foot terminal facility to support corporate business jet and charter airliner traffic. This also coincided with a name change in which the airfield was renamed Lake City Gateway Airport.http://northfloridanow.com/lake-city- gateway-airport-year-in- review-p5252-92.htmhttp://www.lcfla.com/index.php/departments/gateway-airport- klcqhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/public- inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-07782.pdf  Facilities and aircraft  Lake City Gateway Airport covers an area of 1,250 acres (506 ha) at an elevation of 201 feet (61 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 10/28 is 8,003 by 150 feet (2,439 x 46 m) and 5/23 is 4,000 by 75 feet (1,219 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending September 8, 2009, the airport had 28,714 aircraft operations, an average of 78 per day: 86% general aviation, 9% military, and 5% air taxi. At that time there were 33 aircraft based at this airport: 67% single-engine, 18% multi-engine, 9% jet, and 6% helicopter. Although the U.S. Navy departed Lake City over 70 years ago, its comparatively long main runway (8,003 feet), operational Non-Federal Air Traffic Control Tower, and minimal air traffic makes it a popular location for transient Navy P-3C Orions from NAS Jacksonville and Air Force HC-130 Hercules and A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft from Moody AFB to practice approaches and touch-and-go landings. The airport also has a Department of Defense into-plane refueling contract for Jet A fuel, otherwise known as \\"contract fuel,\\" for military aircraft. Besides typical general aviation use, the airport also hosts a major aviation industrial facility formerly known as Aero Corporation, first acquired by TIMCO Aviation Services, and now part of HAECO. HAECO modifies and repairs large aircraft, such as commercial Boeing 727, Boeing 737 and various Airbus airliners, as well as military C-130 Hercules and P-3 Orion aircraft for US military and US civilian operators, as well as overseas military and civilian customers.http://www.timco.aero/  References   External links  * Lake City Gateway Airport at Lake City website * Aerial image as of January 1999 from USGS The National Map  Category:Airports in Florida Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Columbia County, Florida Category:Lake City, Florida Category:1942 establishments in Florida ","title":"Lake City Gateway Airport"},{"id":"13890381","text":"The British BL 6-inch gun Mk XIXI.e. Mark 19 : Britain at the time designated Marks (models) of ordnance using Roman numerals. This was a field gun and field ordnance normally used a different Mark series to naval ordnance, but unusually the next available Mark number in the 6-inch naval gun series was used, rather than Mark I as the first 6-inch BL field gun. was introduced in 1916 as a lighter and longer-range field gun replacement for the obsolescent BL 6-inch gun Mk VII.  History, description  The majority of military planners before the First World War were wedded to the concept of fighting an offensive war of rapid maneuver which in a time before mechanization meant a focus on cavalry and light horse artillery firing shrapnel shells. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. The theorists hadn't foreseen that trenches, barbed wire, and machine guns had robbed them of the mobility they had been counting on and like in the Franco-Prussian War and Russo-Turkish War the need for heavy artillery reasserted itself. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. The combatants scrambled to find anything that could fire a heavy shell and that meant emptying the fortresses and scouring the depots for guns held in reserve. It also meant converting coastal artillery and surplus naval guns to field guns by either giving them simple field carriages or mounting the larger pieces on rail carriages. The Mk XIX was designed and built by Vickers specifically as a field gun, unlike its predecessors which originated as naval guns. Its length was reduced from the 45 calibres of its naval gun predecessors to 35 calibres, to reduce weight and improve mobility. The Mk XIX was a typical British built-up gun of the period constructed of steel with a central rifled tube reinforced with braided wire wound around the liner, a protective outer jacket, breech bush and breech ring.Handbook of artillery, United States. Army. Ordnance Dept, May 1920, p. 245 The Mk XIX was a breech-loaded design with a Welin interrupted screw breech and used separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. \\"The breech mechanism is operated by means of a lever on the right side of the breech. On pulling the lever to the rear the breech screw is automatically unlocked and swung into the loading position. After loading, one thrust of the lever inserts the breech screw and turns it into the locked position. The breech mechanism is similar to that used on the 8-inch howitzers both in design and operation\\". The Mk XIX utilized the same carriage and recoil mechanism as the BL 8-inch howitzer Mk VI. The carriage was a box trail with two large spoked steel wheels, a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism, and no gun shield. The carriages had an opening behind the breech to allow high angles of elevation. Due to the weight of the gun, it could not be towed by a horse team and had to be towed by a traction engine or artillery tractor instead. The Mk XIX was most often used for long-range counter battery fire.  Operational history  BL 6-inch Mk XIX gun of 484th Siege Battery Royal Garrison Artillery. Battery of four BL 6-inch Mk XIX guns = Great Britain = 310 were built during World War IClarke 2005, p. 40 and the gun served in all theaters, with 108 being in service on the Western front at the end of World War I, but it did not completely replace the Mk VII gun until the end of the war. 3 batteries served with the BEF in France early in World War II, and others were deployed in the home defense of Britain. The gun was superseded by the 155-mm Gun M1, and the carriages used for BL 7.2-inch howitzerNigel F Evans, BRITISH ARTILLERY IN WORLD WAR 2. THE GUNS = United States = When the United States entered the First World War it had a need for long-range heavy artillery, so guns produced for the US Army were given the designation 6-inch gun M1917. In some US sources the Mark XIX designation was also used. 100 weapons were acquired from the British by the US Army beginning in 1917, along with 50 \\"gun bodies\\", presumably as spare barrels. Deliveries were not completed until after March 1920. The carriage was slightly modified from the British BL 8-inch howitzer carriage Mark VII, and was called the 6-inch gun carriage Mark VIIIA.Handbook of artillery, May 1920, p. 245 The US Army Ordnance Department's \\"Handbook of Artillery\\" of May 1920 stated that: \\"The original British ammunition so closely resembled the American that it was decided to use the [US] regular Mark II high-explosive shell... the propellant charge will consist of a base section and increment section having a total weight of approximately 25 pounds\\".Handbook of artillery, US Ordnance Dept., May 1920, p. 277 By 1933 the 99 stored weapons with 51 spare tubes had no ammunition available. Although consideration was given to producing 6-inch ammunition or modifying the guns to use standard 155 mm ammunition, no action was taken and the guns remained in storage. = Brazil = Before the United States entered World War II, the US Army declared the M1917 obsolete and the 99 complete guns were transferred to Brazil as part of a package of military aid in exchange for bases, with deliveries beginning in October 1940. The United States assisted Brazil in producing ammunition for the guns. In 1941, the United States began supplying Brazil with replacement wheels and pneumatic tires to allow the guns to be towed at higher speeds. They were used by Brazil as coastal artillery until the 1960s when they were retired from service. In Brazil they were sometimes used on circular concrete platforms, similar to the \\"Panama mounts\\" used for towed 155 mm guns in US installations. As of 2016, around a dozen guns remained in museums and as memorials in Brazil and elsewhere, although none in the United States. = South Africa = Prior to the outbreak of World War II, the Union Defence Force had planned to use these guns in the fortification of Durban, Cape Town and Saldanha Bay. For a short period, two guns were deployed for the protection of Port Elizabeth harbor at the outbreak of World War II.

The piece, though met with disdain by critics upon its publication in the early 1950s, has attained a prominent place among Norwegian piano sonatas. Sonata Etere is characterized by bimodal/bitonal effects, fixed, continually varied rhythmic patterns, and shifts of accent. The work takes approximately 30 minutes to perform.  Movements  This work has three movements: #In Cerca Di - Moderato #Tono Etereo in Variazoni - Tranquilo ma deciso #Tempo di Pulsazione The sonata makes do with only two main themes, designated In Cerca Di (In search of, henceforth referred to as the first theme) and Tono Etereo (ethereal tune, henceforth referred to as the second theme) Both the themes of the work are introduced in the first movement. = I. In Cerca Di = Measures 1-21 introduce the first theme. Subsequently, the second theme initiates a developmental exposition in which the two themes are frequently juxtaposed. The impression one gets from the collective development of the themes is one of simultaneous unity and duality: the two themes act as one, but are in opposition to each other. The developmental nature of this exposition is similar to traditional sonata procedure. There is a marked difference, however, in that the themes themselves retain their original form, rather than being chopped up into pieces as they would be in, say, a sonata by Beethoven. As developmental tools go, more emphasis is placed on alternating rhythmic patterns and shifts of key and accent. In measure 212 we reach a recapitulation. This section of the piece is an altered repeat of the beginning of the exposition. It retains many of the basic elements of the exposition but many facets, such as key, are changed. The recapitulation is broken off in measure 263, and leads to a coda: the first theme builds to a sonorous climax, and strains of the second theme close the movement. = II. Tono Etereo in Variazoni = This movement consists of 19 distinctive sections: #Tranquilo ma decico # - # - #Viace e con allegra #Moderato #Andante #Piu lento # - #Molto vivace #Allegro molto #Allegretto #Piu moderato #Andante tranquilo #Cosa piu mosso e ben marcato # - (the first theme is brought back here) #Andante (reprise of #1) #Poco moderato (juxtaposition of the first and second theme) #Flebile #Tempo I. Most of the sections are variations on the second theme, but the movement breaks with traditional variations procedure by section 15 - from that point on the first theme is brought back in and the two themes undergo a common development which might remind one of the first movement. = III. Tempo di Pulsazione = This movement is a wild, ominous dance based on the first theme. The second theme does not feature here. This movement has a form identical to that of the first movement.

They recorded five studio albums between 1976 and 1985, and released a live album, En Public Aux Etats- Unis d'Am√©rique recorded during a tour of the United States in 1979. Etron Fou Leloublan were best known as one of the five original Rock in Opposition (RIO) bands that performed at the first RIO festival in London in March 1978. Etron Fou Leloublan's music has been described as a blend of punk rock, jazz, French music hall, comedy satire and \\"avant-garde mayhem\\". History Etron Fou Leloublan were originally called Etron Fou, a trio comprising vocalist and saxophonist Eulalie Ruynat (real name Chris Chanet), Ferdinand Richard (bass guitar) and Guigou Chenevier (drums, percussion). Their first concert was on 27 December 1973 when they opened for the French progressive rock band, Magma.Jones 1995, p.44 Etron Fou then went on to produce a \\"viable, musical alternative to both French rock'n'roll and French free jazz\\", which had stagnated at the time. In November 1976 they changed their name to Etron Fou Leloublan and recorded their first album, Batelages (1977). Chanet left the band before the album was released. Towards the end of 1977 Francis Grand replaced Chanet on saxophone and the trio recorded their second album, Les Trois Fous Perd√©gagnent (Au Pays Des...). In March 1978, at the invitation of English avant-garde rock group Henry Cow, Etron Fou Leloublan joined Rock in Opposition (RIO) and performed at the first RIO festival in London with four other groups. They also played at the second RIO festival in Milan in April 1979, organised by RIO's Italian representative, Stormy Six. In November 1979 Etron Fou Leloublan toured the United States, and performances at the Squat Club in New York City and Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut were recorded and released on a live album, En Public aux Etats-Unis d'Am√©rique. Etron Fou Leloublan became a quartet in 1980 with Bernard Mathieu replacing Grand on saxophone, and the addition of multi-instrumentalist and singer Jo Thirion. In mid-1980 the band recorded with former Henry Cow guitarist Fred Frith in France and Switzerland, and appeared on one side of Frith's 1981 solo LP, Speechless. Frith produced Etron Fou Leloublan's next album, Les Poumons Gonfl√©s (1982), on which he also guested on two of the tracks, playing violin and guitar. For their fifth album, Les Sillons de la Terre (1984) the saxophonist changed again with Bruno Meillier replacing Mathieu. Etron Fou Leloublan recorded their last album, Face Aux √âl√©ments D√©cha√Æn√©s in August 1985 as a trio of Richard, Thirion and Chenevier, not bothering to fill the recurring vacant saxophone position. Frith produced the album and guested on four of the tracks. The band broke up in 1986.

Green is the author of Technoculture: From Alphabet to Cybersex and the editor of Framing Technology: Society, Choice and Change, and also on the editorial board of the Australia Journal of Communication and Media International Australia Incorporating Culture and Policy.  Major areas of work  Lelia Green is the author of Technoculture: From Alphabet to Cybersex. She defines \\"technoculture\\" as the integration of new communication technologies into a society, and in her book she explores the effects of the digital age on society, its structure, and policy creation. Green argues early in her book that the term \\"technoculture\\" is a word that should not be used lightly, as the concept itself is meant to refer closely and accurately to technologies that assist the communication through which culture is built. These technologies can refer to any means of communication in a concrete, physical form. Understood in this context, written language can be regarded as technocultural; however, spoken language cannot, though it can become technocultural if it is placed in a recorded or transmitted form. = Lelia Green and Technology Change =  The mythology of technology  The myths surrounding scientific and technological advancements are based around a celebration of the importance of these developments in our lives. Green emphasizes that the success or failure of a new technological development is based largely on the social context in which it is developed. In order for an invention to be adopted into a society, it must first be accepted, then integrated into the daily experience of the individuals who make up that society. Green argues that technology is developed and adopted due to \\"social determinism\\".Green, Lelia Technoculture Allen & Unwin, Crows Nest p. 3  The ABC of Technological Advantage  Green argues that technological advancements are the result of the choices and priorities of the powerful social elite, who she identifies as the \\"A, B and C of social power\\"‚Äîthe armed forces, the bureaucracy, and the corporate sector.Green, Lelia Technoculture Allen & Unwin, Crows Nest p. 9 Green maintains that these powerful groups, rather than the whole of society, ensure that the technological developments are implemented and accepted. Green also notes that with globalization, the Western power elites are exporting new ideas and new technologies to other cultures and societies around the world, and these societies in turn affect the way the technology is used.

According to the medieval Georgian chronicles, they acquired the crown of Iberia after the Iberian nobles revolted against their king P‚Äôarnajom, of the Pharnabazid dynasty, and petitioned the king of Armenia to send his son, who was married to a Pharnabazid princess, as their new monarch. Both the king of Armenia and his son are referred to in the chronicles as ‚ÄúArshak‚Äù, probably a confusion with Artaxias which seems to be taken as a general term in reference to the Artaxiad kings of Armenia. Professor Cyril Toumanoff identifies the king of Armenia of this account as Artavasdes I (ruled c. 159 BC - c. 115 BC) and considers the newly installed Iberian king, Artaxias I (ruled 90‚Äì78 BC), to have been his son.Toumanoff, Cyril. Chronology of the Early Kings of Iberia. Traditio 25 (1969), pp. 10-11. The chronicle goes on to describe a great battle between a combined Iberian-Armenian army against P‚Äôarnajom and his followers. In the end, P‚Äôarnajom was defeated and killed, and thereafter the Armenian prince was the king of Iberia.Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts, pp. 282-284. Peeters Bvba . Little is known about the early years of the Iberian Artaxiad rule. They seem to have been under the influence of their Armenian cousins to whom Iberia had relinquished a significant portion of its territory. This association with the Armenian Artaxiads, who were at their peak of power during the reign of Tigranes the Great (r. 95‚Äì55 BC), brought about Iberia‚Äôs involvement in the Third Mithridatic War between the Pontus- Armenian alliance and Rome (75‚Äì65 BC). Plutarch and Licinius Macer state that Iberian contingents featured prominently in the battles of Tigranocerta (69 BC) and Artaxata (68 BC). Even after the surrender of Tigranes to the mercy of Pompey, the Artaxiad king of Iberia Artoces (r. 78‚Äì63 BC) continued to offer a stubborn resistance to the invading Romans, but was eventually defeated and forced to plea for peace. This Artoces well known to the Classical sources is apparently the Artag (Artog), son of Arshak/Artaxias, of the Georgian annals which surprisingly omit any mention of the Roman invasion, but instead report the king‚Äôs fighting with the ‚ÄúPersians‚Äù. Roman hegemony over Iberia proved to be impermanent, however, and, in 36 BC, the legate Publius Canidius Crassus had to lead his army into Iberia to force its king Pharnabazus into a new alliance with Rome. Neither Pharnabazus nor his relations with Rome are recorded in the Georgian chronicles whose narrative focuses on King Bartom, son of Artag, and his demise in the struggle with the once exiled prince Mirian who eventually restored the Pharnabazid dynasty to the throne of Iberia. Modern scholars tend to identify Pharnabazus with Bartom and consider him the last in the Artaxiad line.  References  * Melikishvili, Giorgi et al..

He is best known for his work in the 1960s with Tim Hardin, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Charlatans, Sopwith Camel, and later with Norman Greenbaum, Tazmanian Devils and Chris Isaak. Though semi-retired, Jacobsen continues to manage many of his published songs and masters for various uses. Early life He was born in Oak Park, Illinois on the west side of Chicago.[] His early musical influences were wide ranging, including a unique opportunity to listen to the first urban radio stations broadcasting polka, blues and country. Musician In high school he played the tuba and sousaphone. Later, at Oberlin College he began playing bluegrass style banjo and by his senior year, took over leadership of the Oberlin bluegrass band, the Plumb Creek Boys. After graduation in 1962, he formed the Knob Lick Upper 10,000, with Dwain Story and Pete Childs, also Oberlin graduates. They performed at The Bitter End coffee house in New York City, where they were signed by manager Albert Grossman. They recorded two albums for Mercury Records, Introducing The Knob Lick Upper 10,000 (1962), and Work Out (1963), and were among the first folk and bluegrass artists to play Carnegie Hall. In 1964, after hearing the Beatles, Jacobsen quit the Knob Lick Upper 10,000, intending to produce records that combined folk music with electric instruments and drums. Returning to New York, he soon met John Sebastian, who had similar ideas, and they began working with other musicians, including Jerry Yester, Zal Yanovsky, Jesse Colin Young, Cass Elliot, and Denny Doherty. Jacobsen produced various demos for different combinations of these musicians, prototypes of the folk rock style, some of which were issued on the 1966 Elektra album What's Shakin', and others on a 1999 compilation The Magic Circle. Jacobsen was also introduced to singer-songwriter Tim Hardin, began working as his manager, and produced his demos for Columbia Records. The Lovin' Spoonful Starting in 1965, Jacobsen produced the albums Do You Believe in Magic, Daydream, and Hums of the Lovin' Spoonful, which yielded seven straight top-10 singles, including \\"Do You Believe in Magic\\", \\"You Didn't Have to Be So Nice\\", \\"Daydream\\", and the number one hit, \\"Summer in the City\\", which was subsequently voted the number one summertime single of the 20th century by Billboard Magazine.Summer in the City: Mark Sebastian comment The Lovin‚Äô Spoonful also recorded soundtracks for Woody Allen's first movie What‚Äôs Up Tiger Lily as well as Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs You‚Äôre a Big Boy Now. Jacobsen published the band's original songs through his Faithful Virtue Publishing Company and was a major factor in their development. Sebastian has said, \\"I felt like Erik, just as a collaborator, was a fifth member of the Spoonful.\\" 215x215px Tim Hardin Jacobsen discovered singer-songwriter Tim Hardin in 1964, managed him, and produced his first album, Tim Hardin 1. The album includes modern classics like \\"Reason to Believe\\", \\"Misty Roses\\", \\"Don't Make Promises\\", and \\"How Can We Hang on to a Dream\\". To encourage Hardin to write original songs, Jacobsen bought him a tape recorder and paid him $50 for every song Hardin recorded that had at least two verses and a chorus. Songs that Hardin later recorded as demos for Jacobsen also include \\"If I Were a Carpenter\\" and others that appeared on Tim Hardin 2. Hardin's songs were published through Faithful Virtue Music Company. In 1965 Jacobsen also produced the original blues-style recordings that were eventually released as Tim Hardin 4 on Verve Records. Other artists Jacobsen expanded his search for talent to California and worked there with the first of the newly emerging San Francisco rock bands, the Charlatans. While having little recording success, the band served as a launching pad for the songwriter and singer Dan Hicks, composer of the iconic song \\"I Scare Myself,\\" among many others. In 1966, Jacobsen recorded the group Sopwith Camel. Their song \\"Hello Hello\\" was the first pop hit to come out of San Francisco‚Äôs psychedelic era.[ Allmusic.com] He went on to produce their 1973 cult classic, The Miraculous Hump Returns from the Moon. In 1968 Jacobsen began working with singer/songwriter Brian Elliot. One album was released by Warner Brothers Records. In 1986 the Elliot/Jacobsen Publishing Company had Elliot's song \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" covered by Madonna. Her record went on to become an international number one hit, selling over one hundred million copies. Elliot and Jacobsen have continued to work together, releasing the album Full Mental Nudity in 2014.Brian Elliot In 1968, he began working with Norman Greenbaum. They made three albums together, and Jacobsen produced Greenbaum's \\"Spirit in the Sky\\", which became a #1 worldwide hit and went on to be one of the most licensed recordings of all time, appearing in over 40 films and many TV shows and commercials.About Norman Greenbaum In 1969 Jacobsen produced and published the song \\"Mill Valley\\", a number one Adult Contemporary hit for Rita Abrams, a kindergarten school teacher, singing with the Strawberry Point School Third Grade Class. They were featured on the cover of Life magazine and were guests on The Smothers Brothers TV show. A young Francis Ford Coppola made a video for the song.Rita Abrams: Mill Valley Music In 1980-1984 he produced two albums with the San Francisco ska- and reggae-oriented band Tazmanian Devils on Warner Brothers records. In 1981 he teamed up with Chris Isaak as Isaak's producer, publisher, and manager. They worked and toured together through 1998, making five albums, including the double platinum album Heart Shaped World. The breakthrough single, \\"Wicked Game\\", was made into a music video, which has been voted one of MTV‚Äôs sexiest videos of all time.MTV top 20 sexiest music videos Isaak‚Äôs music has also been featured in numerous movies, TV shows, and advertisements.The Charlatans, San Francisco's first 1960s rock group Song Publisher Jacobsen's song publishing credits include, among others: * Lovin' Spoonful and Tim Hardin published by Faithful Virtue Music Company * Sopwith Camel and Norman Greenbaum published by Great Honesty Music * Chris Isaak published by C.

Suibne belonged to the junior branch of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain kindred of the northern U√≠ N√©ill, the Cen√©l Feredaig, named for his grandfather Feredach, a great-grandson of Niall of the Nine Hostages. The kingship of Cen√©l nE√≥gain had been dominated by the Cen√©l maic Ercae, descendants of Feradach's brother Muirchertach mac Ercae. Neither Suibne's father Fiachnae, nor his grandfather, had been kings of Cen√©l nE√≥gain. √Åed Uaridnach of the Cen√©l maic Ercae died in 612, and the kingship of the U√≠ N√©ill passed to the rival northern Cen√©l Conaill in the person of M√°el Coba mac √Åedo. M√°el Coba was killed by Suibne in 615, apparently in the midlands of Ireland, whereupon Suibne took power. It is suggested that Suibne Menn's control of the kingship rested on an alliance with another minor U√≠ N√©ill kindred, the southern Clann Cholm√°in. According to the Irish annals, √ìengus, head of Clann Cholm√°in, was High King at his death in 621, so that Suibne may have granted √ìengus the kingship before assuming it himself. In 628 M√°el Coba's brother Domnall attacked Suibne, but was defeated and fled. Suibne, however, was killed later that year by the king of Ulster, Congal C√°ech, who installed himself as High King. Charles-Edwards supposes that this surprising outcome was achieved \\"perhaps by some form of surprise attack\\". Although the Cen√©l nE√≥gain did not again hold the High Kingship until the 8th century, his descendants, and not the rival Cen√©l maic Ercae, held the kingship of Cen√©l nE√≥gain until the death of his great-grandson Fland mac M√°ele Tuile c. 700.

History  The idea of Maine state arts support began in 1933 when the Maine State Legislature created the Maine Art Commission, a three-member board appointed by the governor. The Commission advised the governor about the acquisition of works of art for state buildings. This entity lasted until a movement in the 1960s to create a permanent state agency in support of the arts and humanities. In 1964, Governor John H. Reed created the Governor's Council on Arts and Culture in Maine. The Council made recommendations on what role the state government should play in support of the arts and humanities, and ultimately recommended the creation of an independent state agency, the Maine State Commission on the Arts and Humanities. Concurrent with this development in Maine, and in part driving it, a movement in Washington, D.C., created the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) as part of the National Foundation on the Arts & Humanities. The Maine State Commission on the Arts and Humanities, the NEA, and the NEH were established in 1965 and became active in 1966. When the Commission was established, its mission was to expand support for the arts in the state. It was one of the only two state agencies in the country dedicated to supporting freedom of artistic expression in this way at the time.

Originally christened Sea Adder, the vessel was launched 25 April 1944 as GladwinThere appears to be some confusion as to the name of APA-106. Some sources say the ship was named Gladwin by Western Pipe & Steel and named USS Hansford by the Navy, others say she was initially named USS Gladwin by the Navy who later changed her name to USS Hansford. Still others say she was initially named USS Hansford by the Navy and then renamed USS Gladwin. The majority of sources however, refer to her during her operational career as USS Hansford. by Western Pipe & Steel of San Francisco, under Maritime Commission contract. She was transferred to the Navy and renamed Hansford (after Hansford County, Texas) on 25 August, and commissioned on 12 October 1944, Comdr. William A. Lynch in command. Operational history After shakedown off San Pedro, California, Hansford got underway for Pearl Harbor 25 November 1944 and unloaded passengers and cargo there on 2 December. In the Hawaiian Islands she undertook an intensive training program emphasizing landing exercises during daylight and maneuvering in formation at night. On 28 December she embarked the 1st Battalion Landing Team, 27th Regiment, 5th Division, U.S. Marines who joined her crew in amphibious training as they made ready for combat. =Casualties at Iwo Jima= An LVT(A)-4 is hoisted from Hansford off Iwo Jima. On 27 January 1945, Hansford sailed for Saipan, the staging area for the invasion of Iwo Jima, next step in America's seaborne thrust across the Pacific. After final rehearsal at Saipan, she sortied 16 February 1945 with Task Force 51. The initial assault waves which stormed the beaches of Iwo Jima 19 February included units from Hansford. She continued to land troops and equipment through 25 February. Although she often closed to within 1,000 yards of land, Hansford managed to escape the enemy shells which landed nearby. However, four of her boats, two LCVP's and two LCM's were lost during the operation, and her beach party, which was ashore from 19 February through 22 February, suffered 17 casualties including one officer and three enlisted men killed and one bluejacket missing. Three members of the boat group were wounded. Each day while she was anchored off Iwo Jima, Hansford embarked and cared for casualties who were brought on board from the beaches. On the afternoon of 25 February she sailed for Saipan. Upon arrival there on 28 February, she transferred 127 casualties to an Army hospital. Hansford departed for Tulagi, Solomon Islands, 5 March 1945, whereupon arrival 12 March, she replaced the boats lost at Iwo Jima. The next day she sailed for the New Hebrides, anchoring in Segond Channel, Espiritu Santo Island, 15 March to embark the 2d Battalion Landing Team, 105th Regiment, 27th Infantry Division. While at Espiritu Santo, Hansford readied herself for further combat. She got underway for Ulithi atoll, the staging area for the invasion of Okinawa, 25 March. =Okinawa= Hansford sortied to the Ryukyus 4 April to take part in the follow-up phases of the vast Okinawa operation, largest invasion of the Pacific War. After a passage made difficult by three submarine contacts and encounters with numerous floating mines, her task group anchored in Kerama Retto 9 April 1945. The next day she steamed to the Hagushi beaches at Okinawa, where she landed her troops and cargo, and embarked casualties. Hansford's crew often sighted enemy planes which raided the area 20 times during the week she was off Okinawa, but she only opened fire once when an enemy plane passed close aboard at an extremely low altitude. The ship's company suffered their only casualty when the barrel of a 20 mm. gun exploded. Hansford departed Okinawa with 51 casualties on board 16 April and transferred them to an Army hospital upon her arrival Saipan 20 April. The next day she got underway for Ulithi where she anchored 23 April for a month of training for future operations against the Japanese home islands. She then proceeded to the Philippines arriving San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, 27 May, to continue preparations for invasion. =After hostilities= The day after the Japanese capitulated, Hansford embarked Commander Amphibious Group 12, Rear Admiral J. L. Hall, and his staff of 62 officers and 218 bluejackets. On 19 August key Army units came on board at Leyte for passage to occupation duty in Japan. She got underway for Tokyo Bay on 25 August, returned to Subic Bay that night because of typhoon, and on 27 August again sailed for Japan. Her formation entered Tokyo Bay early in the watch and passed battleship Missouri as the surrender ceremonies ending the war took place. The next day Hansford's occupation troops and cargo debarked at Yokohama. During the ensuing weeks at Yokohama, Hansford was a center of much activity since Admiral Hall, now serving as Port Director, was embarked. Her duties included quartering liberated Allied prisoners. =Operation Magic Carpet= Assigned to Operation Magic Carpet 13 October, Hansford sailed with 79 officers and 1,320 enlisted passengers whom she debarked in San Pedro 26 October. After repairs in dry dock, she returned to Nagoya, Japan, 4 December and got underway for Seattle, Washington, with another load of troops 7 December. The day after her arrival back in Japan, she was released from \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty, and sailed for the United States. Subsequently, Hansford sailed via the Panama Canal to Norfolk, Virginia. Arriving on 2 May 1946, she decommissioned there 14 June 1946. Commercial service Hansford was redelivered to the Maritime Commission and sold 20 May 1947 to Isthmian Lines, who registered her in New York and renamed her Steel Apprentice. The vessel operated in the service of Isthmian from 1949 until 1969. On 20 October 1953, navigating in thick fog and without operable radar, the Steel Apprentice struck Elbow of Cross Ledge Light head-on, knocking most of the lighthouse into the Delaware Bay. Steel Apprentice was scrapped at Kaohsiung, Taiwan in May 1973.  Crew  The surviving members of the WWII crew of the USS Hansford met for an annual reunion for decades. The last known survivor was Stanley B. Holzhauer who died on October 16th, 2019. His service record on the Hansford is noted with a plaque at the National Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg, Texas.

It deals with the logical structure of quantum mechanical propositions asserted at different points in time.  Introduction  In standard quantum mechanics a physical system is associated with a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H}. States of the system at a fixed time are represented by normalised vectors in the space and physical observables are represented by Hermitian operators on \\\\mathcal{H}. A physical proposition \\\\,P about the system at a fixed time can be represented by a projection operator \\\\hat{P} on \\\\mathcal{H} (See quantum logic). This representation links together the lattice operations in the lattice of logical propositions and the lattice of projection operators on a Hilbert space (See quantum logic). The HPO formalism is a natural extension of these ideas to propositions about the system that are concerned with more than one time.  History Propositions  = Homogeneous Histories = A homogeneous history proposition \\\\,\\\\alpha is a sequence of single-time propositions \\\\alpha_{t_i} specified at different times t_1 < t_2 < \\\\ldots < t_n . These times are called the temporal support of the history. We shall denote the proposition \\\\,\\\\alpha as (\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_n) and read it as \\"\\\\alpha_{t_1} at time t_1 is true and then \\\\alpha_{t_2} at time t_2 is true and then \\\\ldots and then \\\\alpha_{t_n} at time t_n is true\\" = Inhomogeneous Histories = Not all history propositions can be represented by a sequence of single-time propositions are different times. These are called inhomogeneous history propositions. An example is the proposition \\\\,\\\\alpha OR \\\\,\\\\beta for two homogeneous histories \\\\,\\\\alpha, \\\\beta.  History Projection Operators  The key observation of the HPO formalism is to represent history propositions by projection operators on a history Hilbert space. This is where the name \\"History Projection Operator\\" (HPO) comes from. For a homogeneous history \\\\alpha = (\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_n) we can use the tensor product to define a projector \\\\hat{\\\\alpha}:= \\\\hat{\\\\alpha}_{t_1} \\\\otimes \\\\hat{\\\\alpha}_{t_2} \\\\otimes \\\\ldots \\\\otimes \\\\hat{\\\\alpha}_{t_n} where \\\\hat{\\\\alpha}_{t_i} is the projection operator on \\\\mathcal{H} that represents the proposition \\\\alpha_{t_i} at time t_i. This \\\\hat{\\\\alpha} is a projection operator on the tensor product \\"history Hilbert space\\" H = \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\otimes \\\\ldots \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{H} Not all projection operators on H can be written as the sum of tensor products of the form \\\\hat{\\\\alpha}. These other projection operators are used to represent inhomogeneous histories by applying lattice operations to homogeneous histories.  Temporal Quantum Logic  Representing history propositions by projectors on the history Hilbert space naturally encodes the logical structure of history propositions. The lattice operations on the set of projection operations on the history Hilbert space H can be applied to model the lattice of logical operations on history propositions. If two homogeneous histories \\\\,\\\\alpha and \\\\,\\\\beta don't share the same temporal support they can be modified so that they do. If \\\\,t_i is in the temporal support of \\\\,\\\\alpha but not \\\\,\\\\beta (for example) then a new homogeneous history proposition which differs from \\\\,\\\\beta by including the \\"always true\\" proposition at each time \\\\,t_i can be formed. In this way the temporal supports of \\\\,\\\\alpha, \\\\beta can always be joined together. What shall therefore assume that all homogeneous histories share the same temporal support. We now present the logical operations for homogeneous history propositions \\\\,\\\\alpha and \\\\,\\\\beta such that \\\\hat{\\\\alpha} \\\\hat{\\\\beta} = \\\\hat{\\\\beta}\\\\hat{\\\\alpha} = Conjunction (AND) = If \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are two homogeneous histories then the history proposition \\"\\\\,\\\\alpha and \\\\,\\\\beta\\" is also a homogeneous history. It is represented by the projection operator \\\\widehat{\\\\alpha \\\\wedge \\\\beta}:= \\\\hat{\\\\alpha} \\\\hat{\\\\beta} (= \\\\hat{\\\\beta} \\\\hat{\\\\alpha}) = Disjunction (OR) = If \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are two homogeneous histories then the history proposition \\"\\\\,\\\\alpha or \\\\,\\\\beta\\" is in general not a homogeneous history.

Career He was under-treasurer of the exchequer, chancellor of the Court of Augmentations, Escheator of Surrey and Sussex in 1541‚Äì42 and was made custos rotulorum of Sussex in 1549 (till his death) and is the first listed Lord Lieutenant of that county from 1550 (till his death); he was also made steward of the archbishop of Canterbury's Sussex manors in 1554. He was elected as MP for Chichester in 1547, for Sussex in March 1553, 1559 and 1563 and for Portsmouth in 1554. He was knighted by 1549. When the Court of Augmentations was dissolved in January 1554, Sackville, at the time losing most of his other paid positions, retired to the life of a Sussex gentleman, serving as JP. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth (her mother was his mother's cousin) his fortunes improved. He was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1559, holding the position until his death in 1566. Marriage and issue In 1535 Sackville married Winifred (d. 1586), the daughter of Sir John Brydges [Bridges or Brugge] (ca. 1460‚Äì1530), (Lord Mayor of the City of London in 1520) and his wife Agnes Ayloffe, the daughter of Thomas Ayloffe. They had a son Thomas, a favourite of Elizabeth I, and a daughter Anne.After Richard Sackville's death his widow, Winifred before 30 September 1568, married John Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester becoming his third wife, the marriage produced no issue.

It has been known to hybridize with the small yellow ladyslipper, C. parviflorum var. makasin, resulting in the natural hybrid Cypripedium √ó andrewsii. The leaves and stems are slightly pubescent. The plants grow in (generally) long-lived clumps, with some clumps having up to 50 or more flowers. It is a perennial, with horizontal, wiry- rooted rhizomes growing a few centimeters below the surface of the soil, and hence resistant to most prairie fires. Conservation Botanical illustration. Cypripedium candidum is considered rare across Canada, endangered in Ontario, and protected under the Ontario Endangered Species Act. It is believed to be extirpated from Saskatchewan. In Ontario, this orchid has never been common due to limited occurrences of fens in its southern Ontario range. It is now known from only two sites in Ontario. It is threatened in the United States, extirpated from Pennsylvania, endangered in South Dakota and Wisconsin, Kentucky, and Michigan, and rare in Missouri and North Dakota. In Illinois, it was listed as endangered in 1980, downgraded to threatened in 1998, and delisted in 2014, when the Illinois Endangered Species Protection Board considered it to be \\"recovered and/or more common than originally thought\\". It is listed in Canada as N2, or endangered. Globally, however, it is listed as G4 (apparently secure) because there are protected sites across its entire range. Habitat loss due to fragmentation through agriculture and development, suppression of fire, incursions by invasive species, especially reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), dogwood (Cornus sp.), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), St. John's wort (Hypericum spp.), and buckthorn (Rhamnus spp.), changes in hydrology, loss of pollinators, hybridization and environmental challenges to the obligate mycorrhizae that support this species are all responsible for its decline. It also has a low seed set caused by often unpollinated flowers.Walsh RP, Arnold PM, Michaels HJ. 2014. Effects of pollination limitation and seed predation on female reproductive success of a deceptive orchid. AoB PLANTS 6: plu031; doi:10.1093/aobpla/plu031 Pollinators for this flower include andrenid and halictid bees. They are observed entering the lip of the flower from the opening to deposit pollen on the stigma while simultaneously brushing the anther to pick up more pollen.Catling, P.M., & Knerer, G. (1980). Pollination of the small white lady's-slipper (Cypripedium candidum) in Lambton County, Southern Ontario. Like many wild orchids, this species has been further endangered by collecting for generally futile attempts at cultivation. It is shade-intolerant and therefore requires substantial management for invasive and woody species as part of any species recovery strategies. Long-term monitoring of this species is being done through various scientific organizations, including the Chicago Botanic Garden's Plants of Concern program. Woody encroachment is considered the greatest modern threat to monitored small white lady's slipper populations in the Chicago region. The Plants of Concern program found significantly more lady's slipper plants when prescribed burning and brush removal were conducted compared to sites without the employment of these management tools.

He was born Francis Evans, the son of Sebastian Evans, in Moseley, near Birmingham. He later assumed his mother's family name of Bennett-Goldney. Bennett-Goldney was appointed as Athlone Pursuivant of the Order of St Patrick in February 1907, and has been mentioned as a possible suspect in the theft of the insignia of the Order, known as the Irish Crown Jewels, in July 1907.\\"New suspect in century-old theft of Irish gems\\" Daily Telegraph 26 December 2007 From at least 1899 to 1913, Bennett-Goldney was the honorary curator of Royal Museum and Art Gallery in Canterbury. He served as Mayor of Canterbury, 1906 ‚Äì 11. He was elected as the Independent Unionist Member of Parliament for Canterbury at the general election of December 1910; he had stood at the January 1910 general election, narrowly failing to defeat the Conservative MP. In the years leading up to the war, he frequently spoke of the threat posed by Germany, and never wavered from his opinions despite criticism. He was also very active in the service of aiding refugees in the early days of the war. His family home, Abbot's Barton in Canterbury, was used as a VAD hospital. He joined the British Embassy in Paris in October 1917 as honorary assistant military attach√©. He was promoted as a temporary major on the General List on 13 May 1918. He died 26 July 1918 in an American hospital in Brest from injuries sustained in a car accident. He was buried at St Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. Bennett-Goldney is commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs that died during World War I to be named on that memorial. At the time of his death, he was the 17th member of the House of Commons to have died serving in the war. Bennett-Goldney is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes a short biographical account of the life and death of Bennett-Goldney.  Thievery  Following Bennett-Goldney's death, it was discovered he was a chronic thief, his home filled with stolen items, including a painting which was the property of the Duke of Bedford. His estate was subject to legal action to retrieve some of his thefts from the City of Canterbury Museum and Library.Bateman, Audrey The Magpie Tendency, A.

Career  Salt and Sauce were owned and presented by some of the most famous show business people of their era. Their owners included Carl Hagenbeck, George William Lockhart, Herbet \\"Captain Joe\\" Taylor, John \\"Broncho Bill\\" Swallow, Dudley Zoo, Tom Fossett, Dennis Fossett, Harry Coady and Billy Butlin. Their presenters included Ivor Rosaire and Emily Paulo. Formerly members and believed to be the longest surviving members of George William Lockhart's \\"Cruet\\", they were featured in various books, newspapers and magazines in their day, and are the focus of a book, The Legend of Salt and Sauce. The elephants were famed for their vast array of tricks, but also feared for their temperamental moods. Sauce (known as \\"Saucy\\" most of the time) killed George William Lockhart (her owner and trainer) in an accident at Walthamstow Station and Salt killed William Aslett (an elephant groom) when she attacked him in 1957 on Rosaire's Circus.  Deaths  Despite Salt suffering dropsy symptoms that had already killed two other members of \\"The Cruet\\" she went on to live for five decades. Her death was well documented in the Cambridge local press (source: The Legend of Salt and Sauce) when she accidentally got stuck in Vauxhall Lake in Sturry, Canterbury, Kent, whilst touring with Ringland's Circus in 1952. After seven hours and with the aid of a crane she was freed from the lake, but suffered from pneumonia and died after a week. According to the local press over a hundred wreaths were left for her at the circus. It was predicted that her lifelong companion, Sauce, would die soon afterwards (source: Salt and Sauce were Separated by John D. Swallow), but she lived until 1960, dying from \\"natural causes\\".  Media featuring Salt and Sauce  Salt and Sauce were booked on numerous famous British circuses (source: \\"World's Fair\\", \\"King Pole\\" magazine, various programmes, \\"The Victorian Arena\\" by John Turner and \\"The Legend of Salt and Sauce\\" by Jamie Clubb). Confirmed buildings they worked in included The Lyceum, Norwich Hippodrome, Blackpool Tower, Great Yarmouth Hippodrome and World's Fair Islington. Circuses included Tom Sylvester's, Bertram Mills' Circus, Billy Smart, Sr.'s Circus, Broncho Bill's Circus, Rosaire's Circus, Paulo's Circus, Ringland's Circus and Cody's Circus (Sauce only) among many others.

Founded by Tony Ellsworth in 1991, they produced a wide range of handmade bicycles made in the U.S.A.: mountain, road, beach cruisers, BMX, and fat bikes. The brand has gone through three ownership changes since 2014, and now focus on producing high-quality mountain bikes specifically in the genres of XC, trail, and enduro.Ellsworth bike range Ellsworth also produce a designer/cruiser bike known as \\"The Ride\\" Ellsworth - The Ride  History  The company was founded by Tony Ellsworth.Bicycle Retailer and Industry News In 1991, Tony Ellsworth built his first bicycle frame after a dramatic career change was brought on by deteriorating health. He built his first full- suspension mountain bike for his wife in 1993. By 1994, Tony was building bikes \\"for people whose names he didn't know,\\" at which point he considered that he indeed built himself a business.He found happiness off beaten path - The San Diego Union Tribune September 2014: BST Nano Carbon acquired Ellsworth. BST shifted the brand's location from Ramona, CA, to San Diego, CA. BST re-focused the brand to keep up with the industry-trend of manufacturing carbon fiber frames and updated their lineup's frame geometry to follow suit. BST planned on manufacturing the brand's frames and components at its San Diego facility, and they moved the aluminium frames to be manufactured by a separate Southern California vendor. Ellsworth did not release any bikes in 2015 as BST underestimated the costs associated with producing carbon fiber frames in California. January 2016: Jonathan Freeman, a private investor from San Diego, bought the company from BST the new owner bringing in much needed capital for the 25-year-old brand. Freeman worked hand-in-hand with Tony to bring a new and updated product range including both carbon fiber and aluminium alloy frames. The frames are produced in Taiwan and are assembled in San Diego, CA. May 2018: South African Ellsworth Distributor, ASG Group, acquires Ellsworth. Ellsworth currently operates from its new facility in San Diego, CA, as a subsidiary of ASG North America. ASG also distributes other house brands into U.S.A., including SCICON.  Innovation  CURRENT: Ellsworth bicycles used Instant Center Tracking (ICT) technology, an Ellsworth-specific technology. Tony Ellsworth, founder of the company, holds nine patents related to ICT technology. The 2016 and newer bikes change the ICT linkage to Active Energy Efficient Suspension (AEES)- fully active rear suspension. In 2004 Fallbrook Technologies partnered with Ellsworth to commercialize their NuVinci technology (a new drivetrain targeted for use on bicycles), and tried adapting its technology for other uses. The large NuVinci hub uses a new technology, a 'continuously variable planetary' drive train, to allow multiple gear ratios while removing the gears. Thus, a derailleur and multiple gears are no longer necessary. This technology is already in use on Ellsworth's 'The Ride', a cruising bike, which was designed specifically for the NuVinci. The Ride was scheduled to be a limited production run of only 500 units. However, after 135 of The Ride frames being built, the jig went out of alignment; due to poor sales of The Ride, Ellsworth decided to avoid the expense of fixing the jig and discontinued the model.

Campbell fought Mid Lanarkshire for the Conservatives in 1906. Campbell entered the House of Commons at a by-election, 20 December 1911, defeating Andrew Macbeth Anderson QC, who sought re-election on being appointed Solicitor General for Scotland. Anderson, in accordance with the constitutional arrangements of the day, was obliged to resign as an MP and fight a by-election on being appointed a law officer of the Crown. The contest was dominated by the government's legislation on National Insurance and the uncertainties this legislation would produce for individual electors, particularly those of small manufacturers and shopkeepers. Although there was no Labour candidate, Anderson was thought to have lost some support among working-class voters because of his opposition to Labour candidates in other recent elections.The Times, 20 December 1911 p10 After a tight contest, Campbell captured the seat by a majority of 271 votes.The Times, 22 December 1911 p6 Duncan Campbell's name on the Soldiers' Tower at the University of Toronto He was wounded at the first battle of Ypres in November 1914 while serving with the Black Watch; he lost his left arm and was invalided for a year.

History The camera was a development of (and one of two replacements for) the Pentax ME. Both feature semi-automatic (aperture priority) operation, and are part of the Pentax M series which included the manual Pentax MX and briefly the semi-automatic, automatic-focus Pentax ME F. The ME Super added a manual mode to the feature set of the ME. Since the ME Super was a better specified camera than the ME, a lower-specification model was introduced at the same time, as the lower-end replacement for the ME: this was the Pentax MV, a short-lived model quickly replaced by the Pentax MV1. Operation The ME Super has an electronic focal plane shutter with metal curtains and a vertical movement. Shutter speeds are selected with up and down buttons rather than the conventional wheel. They run from 4 seconds to 1/2000 of a second, with flash synchronisation at 1/125 of a second. The hotshoe features an additional shoe contact for dedicated Pentax flash units, not seen on the preceding ME. In the event of battery failure, the camera can continue to operate at a shutter speed of 1/125 of a second. This feature was lost in later, more fully automatic models such as the Pentax Super-A, contributing to the long-lasting popularity of the ME Super. Two LR44 (or equivalent) batteries power the camera. The camera has a 0.95x viewfinder, covering 92% of the field. The finder screen is fixed, with a split image and a microprism ring in the centre. The exposure meter is a TTL open aperture centre-weighted type. The shutter speed chosen by the camera or the user is displayed in the finder, the aperture is not. LEDs display the shutter speed and inform of over/under exposure, possibility of shake, use of the EV- compensation and use of Manual mode. The selector around the release button has five positions: L (lock), Auto, M (manual), 125x, and B. The Pentax ME Super can attach to the external winder ME (1.5 i/s) or the later Winder ME II (2i/s) and can also mount a Dial Data ME databack, or the later Digital Data M databack via a cord adapter. As with some other M series cameras, there is a window next to the winder arm which indicates film movement, and assists the user in rewinding film into the cassette without losing the tip of the film. The lenses are interchangeable with the K bayonet mount, and a series of SMC Pentax-M compact lenses were introduced during the lifetime of the M series models. The body was available with a chrome or black finish on the upper parts and base (the central body being always black). There was a special edition called ME Super SE, only sold in chrome finish; the differences are the SE marking and the diagonal instead of horizontal split-image device in the focusing screen.ME Super page by Bojidar Dimitrov.

This line, the third railroad project by Otto Mears, began in 1889 as a branch of the Silverton Railroad to Eureka. Incorporated in 1895 as the Silverton Northern Railroad, the line was projected to run past Eureka to Animas Forks and on to Mineral Point and then on to Lake City via Henson Creek, including a proposed three- quarter-mile tunnel through the mountains. However, Animas Forks was the end of the line, which was reached in 1896. Operations on the line were seasonal, due to the tremendous amount of snowfall that was typical in the San Juan region, and the Silverton Railroad and the Silverton Northern, while never officially merged, were operated as one entity, sharing rolling stock and motive power. In 1915, the Silverton, Gladstone and Northerly Railroad was purchased by Mears, becoming the SN's Gladstone Branch. The railroad managed to survive bad weather and fluctuating metals markets for years, the Silverton Railroad being dismantled in 1926 after several years of inactivity, and the main line was cut back from Animas Forks to Eureka in the late 1930s. Finally, in 1942, while the mines were idle and US involvement in World War II was increasing, the remaining SN equipment was requisitioned by the US Army for use on the White Pass and Yukon Route during the hurried construction of the Alaska Highway, and the rails were torn up for scrap.

The object of such an analysis is the meaningful lived world of everyday life ( or \\"Lifeworld\\"). The task of phenomenological sociology is to account for, or describe, the formal structures of the given object of investigation in terms of subjectivity, as an object-constituted-in-and-for-consciousness. That which makes such a description different from the \\"naive\\" subjective descriptions of the man in the street, or those of the traditional social scientist, both operating in the natural attitude of everyday life, is the utilization of phenomenological methods. Context Social phenomenologists talk about the social construction of reality. They view social order as a creation of everyday interaction, often looking at conversations to find the methods that people use to maintain social relations. The leading exponent of Phenomenological Sociology was Alfred Sch√ºtz (1899‚Äì1959). Sch√ºtz sought to provide a critical philosophical foundation for Max Weber's interpretive sociology (verstehende Soziologie) by applying methods and insights derived from the phenomenological philosophy of Edmund Husserl (1859‚Äì1938) to the study of the social world. It is the building of this bridge between Husserlian phenomenology and Weberian sociology that serves as the starting point for contemporary phenomenological sociology. However, the prominence of Weberian themes in the field does not mean that all versions of phenomenological sociology must be based on such. In point of fact, there is some historical evidence that would suggest that elements of Weberian sociology are themselves based on certain phenomenological themes; especially in regard to the theory of the intended meaning of an act, and ideas regarding theory and concept formation. For instance, Weber may have taken influence from Wilhelm Dilthey's theory of Weltanschauung, who may have also taken from Husserl's theory of meaning. While Husserl's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of intentional consciousness, Sch√ºtz was concerned with establishing the formal structures of what he termed the (\\"Lifeworld\\").Sch√ºtz, Alfred, and Thomas Luckmann. 1980 [1973]. \\"Structures of the Life-World\\" 1, translated by R. M. Zaner and J. T. Engelhardt Jr. Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. . Husserl's work was conducted as a transcendental phenomenology of consciousness. Sch√ºtz's work was conducted as a mundane phenomenology of the social world. The difference in their respective projects rests at the level of analysis, the objects taken as a topic of study, and the type of phenomenological reduction that is employed for the purposes of analysis. Ultimately these two distinct phenomenological projects should be seen as complementary, with the structures of the latter dependent on the structures of the former. That is, valid phenomenological descriptions of the formal structures of the life-world should be wholly consistent with the descriptions of the formal structures of intentional consciousness. It is from the latter that the former derives its validity, verifiability, and truth value. This is in keeping with Husserl's conception of phenomenology as \\"First Philosophy\\", the foundation, or ground, for both philosophy and all of the sciences. Core assumptions The general thesis of the natural attitude is the ideational foundation for the fact-world of our straightforward, common sense social experience . It unites the world of individual objects into a unified world of meaning, which we assume is shared by any and all who share our culture.Schutz, Alfred. 1962. The Problem of Social Reality: Collected Papers I. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff. [note: this citation is only an assumption, as the original author only provided the information \\"(Schutz 1962)\\" without further elaboration.] It forms the underpinning for our thoughts and actions. It is the projected assumption, or belief, in a naturally occurring social world that is both factually objective in its existential status, and unquestioned in its \\"natural\\" appearance; social objects (persons, language, institutions, etc.) have the same existential \\"thing\\" status as objects occurring in nature (rocks, trees, and animals, etc.). Although it is often referred to as the \\"General Thesis of the Natural Attitude\\", it is not a thesis in the formal sense of the term, but a non-thematic assumption, or belief, that underlies our sense of the objectivity and facticity of the world, and the objects appearing in this world. The facticity of this world of common sense is both unquestioned and virtually \\"unquestionable;\\" it is sanctionable as to its status as that which \\"is,\\" and that which \\"everyone,\\" or, at least, \\"any reasonable person,\\" agrees to be the case with regard to the factual character of the world. As far as traditional social science is concerned, this taken-for-granted world of social facts is the starting and end point for any and all investigations of the social world. It provides the raw, observable, taken-for-granted \\"data\\" upon which the findings of the social sciences are idealized, conceptualized, and offered up for analysis and discourse. Within traditional social science, this \\"data\\" is formulated into a second order world of abstractions and idealizations constituted in accordance with these sciences' pre-determined interpretive schemes. Schutz's phenomenological descriptions are made from within the phenomenological attitude, after the phenomenological reduction (epoche), which serves to suspend this assumption, or belief, and reveal the phenomena occurring within the natural attitude as objects-for-consciousness. = The stock of knowledge = The term ‚Äústock of knowledge‚Äù was coined by Sch√ºtz. This concept is vital to phenomenological sociologists and their claim that social reality is intersubjective. While phenomenologists tend to focus on establishing the structures of ‚Äúintentional consciousness,‚Äù as Husserl calls it, proponents of phenomenological sociology are interested in the structures of the ‚Äúlifeworld.‚Äù The latter refers to the world as directly experienced through the subjectivity of everyday life. As we go through our everyday lives, we draw on our stocks of knowledge to make interpretations. The \\"stock of knowledge‚Äù is typically a \\"deep background configuration\\" of a series of past experiences comprising: \\"one‚Äôs native language and linguistic rules; conventional modes of interpreting expressions and events; numerous theories and methods; aural and visual forms; shared cultural and normative understandings, and the like.\\" Sch√ºtz argued that all \\"interpretation of this world is based upon a stock of previous experiences of it.\\" Reduction Martin Heidegger characterizes Husserl's phenomenological research project as, \\"the analytic description of intentionality in its a priori;\\"Heidegger, Martin. 1992 [1962].

Available in full via PDF-Objects. as it is the phenomenon of intentionality which provides the mode of access for conducting any and all phenomenological investigations, and the ultimate ground or foundation guaranteeing any findings resulting from any such inquiry. In recognizing consciousness as having the formal structure of intentionality, as always having consciousness of an intended object, Husserlian phenomenology has located the access point to a radical new form of scientific description. Methodologically, access to this field is obtained through the phenomenological reduction. While there is some controversy as to the official name, number, and levels of the reduction, this internal argument among the philosophers need not concern us. For the purposes of a mundane phenomenology of the social world, we, as phenomenological social scientists, engage in a mundane phenomenological reduction called the Epoch√©. The hallmark of this form of the reduction is what it reveals about its field of inquiry: a mundane phenomenology of the social world defines its phenomenal field as the intersubjective region of mundane consciousness as appearing from within the natural attitude. The phenomenological reduction as applied to a mundane analysis of the social world consists of the bracketing [equivalents: methodical disregard, putting out of play, suspension] of the thesis of the natural attitude. This bracketing is nothing more than a bracketing of the existential belief in the existence of the objective world; the existential status of the world itself is not called into question. The result of this bracketing is that our attention is shifted from the objects in the world as they occur in nature, to the objects in the world as they appear for consciousness - as phenomenon for intentional consciousness. Our descriptions of objects in the world are now transformed from the naive descriptions of objects as occurring in nature, to phenomenological descriptions of objects as appearing for consciousness. In short, for the purpose of a mundane phenomenological analysis within the natural attitude, the epoche transforms objects as occurring in nature into: objects-for-subjectivity, objects-for-consciousness, objects-as-intended. Keep in mind that for positivism, the meaning of an object is, by definition, \\"objective\\". That is, the meaning of the object is a property of the object itself, is independent of any particular observer, and \\"the same\\" for any and all observers regardless of their orientation or perspective. For phenomenology, an object is always intended, and constituted, as meaningful by a particular intending subject from a particular orientation and from a particular perspectival viewing point. In addition, phenomenologically speaking, the meaning of the object cannot be separated from its phenomenality, or materiality, and cannot be constituted qua meaningful object without the meaning bestowing act of intending on the part of a constituting subject. For a phenomenology undertaken within the natural attitude, meaning does not inherently accrue to an object as a thing-in-itself, is not an \\"add- on\\" to the object (a label), and is not separable from the object as constituted by the intending subject in the act of meaning constitution. For phenomenology, the meaning and the object (in its \\"materiality\\") are co- constituted in the intending of the object by the subject‚Äîphenomenologically speaking there are only meaningful objects. There is no such thing as a neutrally valued object, or a meaningless object, and the notion of an object as \\"nonsense\\" is itself a meaningful determination - as the existentialists would say, we are condemned to meaning. Note that, because we as observers have already been born into an already-existing social world that is already pre-interpreted - through both social meanings and through architectural and business intentionality - and 'made meaningful-to-us' as an intersubjectively available \\"entity\\", any proposal that the subject is creating the object, or creating the meaning of the object as an individual achievement in a particular situation is a misrepresentation of what is actually taking place. Within the 'Natural Attitude of Everyday Life', the subject's role in the constitution of meaningful objects is better understood as a reading off, or interpretation, of the meaning from the object-as-intended. This reading off, or interpretation, of the object's meaning is an intersubjective achievement of the intending subject that takes place within the intersubjective realm of the natural attitude.

He first appeared as a supporting character in their first novel, Relic (1995), and in its 1997 sequel Reliquary, before assuming the protagonist role in the 2002 novel The Cabinet of Curiosities. Pendergast is a special agent with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He once worked out of the New Orleans Field Office of the FBI, but resides in New York City and works out of the New York Field Office; he frequently travels out of state to investigate cases which interest him, often those appearing to be the work of serial killers.  Background  Aloysius Xingu Leng Pendergast was born in early December 1960 and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Pendergast retains his Southern manners and mellifluous Deep Southern accent. He studied anthropology at Harvard University (graduating summa cum laude) and received two D. Phil. degrees, one in Classics and the other in philosophy, from Balliol College, Oxford. Pendergast once served with the U.S. Special Forces in the elite \\"Ghost Company\\", a spiritual successor to the \\"Blue Light\\" detachment (now Delta Force) with Michael Decker and Howard Longstreet, his superiors at the FBI, and Proctor, who later became his bodyguard and chauffeur. The symbol for this company was \\"a ghost on a blue field, decorated with a star throwing a thunderbolt at a cat's eye with the number nine as its pupil, symbolizing the nine lives [its] members [...] were alleged to have...\\" The motto was \\"Fidelitas usque ad mortem\\" (Loyalty unto death). Most of his military records are classified and unknown. A number of years before the series began, Pendergast was married to Helen Esterhazy Pendergast. She was presumed killed in a hunting accident while in Africa (mauled by a lion), but reappears in the \\"Helen Trilogy\\". Pendergast is generally described as being stoically aloof and eccentric, though his ineffable politeness and unerring intellect imbue him with an irresistible charm or enigmatic sense of danger if the occasion should call for it. Well-learned in many subjects, he converses easily with doctors, scientists, intellectuals, vagabonds, highly specialized masters of specific disciplines, and people of a wide variety of language and culture alike. He is a master of psychological manipulation, disguise, and improvisation. Pendergast appreciates the finer things in life, including expensive cuisine and wines. Food and drink he enjoys include Ch√¢teau P√©trus wine, antipasto, green tea of only the purest and most spiritual kind, gelato, and steak tartare. He has a great distaste for opera. His interests encompass a wide variety of vastly differing walks of life, yet all focus on the enlightenment of the human mind, body, and soul. He spent a year in Tibet studying the deep meditative art of Chongg Ran, taught to him by the monks of the Gsalrig Chongg monastery. Pendergast is polyglot, demonstrating mastery of French, Italian, Latin, Greek, and Cantonese, and appears semi-fluent in Mandarin. He also has some knowledge of Japanese and Portuguese. He communicates with one of his housekeepers, who is deaf and mute, using American Sign Language.  Appearance  Pendergast is always described as being tall and slender. He is fit, graceful in movement and physically powerful despite his slight frame. His skin is very pale and many people refer to him as \\"corpse-like\\" or as an \\"albino\\". He has platinum blond hair, and eyes that are most often described as silver or gray. Pendergast religiously dresses in black, bespoke suits (of Italian design) made of a special blend of wool made only in the 1950s, thus he is often described as looking like an undertaker. In many cases, Pendergast's normal appearance is irrelevant. A master of disguises, he has fooled even close acquaintances on several occasions. Accoutrements Pendergast owns a 1959 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith (he used to have two but sold one). His chauffeur and personal assistant is a mysterious man named Proctor. All of Pendergast's suits are custom-made in Italy, and his shoes hand-made by John Lobb of London. Pendergast's personal sidearm is usually a customized .45 Caliber Les Baer Government Model M1911 pistol. In Relic he carried a .45 Colt Anaconda double-action revolver. He owns a Signature Grade Colt 1911 .45ACP tuned by pistolsmith Hilton Yam (now owner of 10-8 Consulting). Pendergast maintains an apartment at The Dakota in New York City, and later inherits and renovates a Beaux Arts mansion near Harlem from his great-granduncle in The Cabinet of Curiosities. In his Dakota apartment, which is actually three apartments combined, there is a full zen garden where Pendergast performs the tea ceremony and sometimes meditates. Though he is a scrupulously scientific man, he wears a talisman or amulet on a chain, that consists of his own modified version of the Pendergast family crest: a lidless eye over two moons, one new and one full, with a phoenix (the original version featured a lion). Pendergast carries a variety of hidden tools, such as lock picks, flashlights of various sizes, test tubes, syringes, and forensic chemicals. Friends and relations *Lt. Vincent D'Agosta ‚Äì NYPD (formerly Southampton PD). Possibly Pendergast's most trusted friend and associate. *Constance Greene ‚Äì Pendergast's ward, research assistant, social secretary, amanuensis, seer. An anachronism who appears 19, quietly beautiful with violet eyes and auburn hair, and possessing a depth of almost limitless knowledge. Born around 1876, her guardian and sister was experimented on and killed by Pendergast's ancestor, Enoch Leng, during his life-extending elixir process. Enoch informally adopts her at the age of six, while testing elixirs on her and raising her in his reclusive home as a student of erudite knowledge. When Enoch is brutally murdered, she hides in fear into the mansion and its catacombs, traveling only at night through the secret entrance to the Hudson River area of Riverside Drive. Although she has Svengali type feelings for Pendergast, she falls prey to his brother's psychotic seduction resulting in a child. The child is secreted away at the Gsalrig Chongg monastery, where, after her confession of love to Pendergast goes unrequited, Constance retires for a period. Constance returned to New York and was tried for the murder of her child and placed in the Mount Mercy Hospital for the Criminally Insane but later exonerated and released and began acting as a tutor and surrogate \\"big sister\\" to Pendergast's son, Tristram, in the 2012 novel Two Graves. *Proctor ‚Äì Pendergast's butler and chauffeur with abilities far beyond most people's assumptions. Before becoming Pendergast's butler, he served in the Special Forces Ghost Company with him. *Wren ‚Äì a book restorer at the New York Public Library. *Mime ‚Äì an invalid of unknown affiliation, Thalidomide baby; skilled in obtaining obscure information via the computer and Internet. Also featured in Mount Dragon as the friend of Charles Levine. *Dr. Nora Kelly ‚Äì New York Museum of Natural History curator; also featured as protagonist in Thunderhead. *William \\"Bill\\" Smithback, Jr. ‚Äì New York Times (formerly New York Post) journalist. (deceased as of Cemetery Dance). *Captain Laura Hayward ‚Äì New York City Police Department, married to Vincent D'agosta, not an avid fan of Pendergast's but will often assist in cases. *Dr. Margo Green ‚Äì New York Museum of Natural History curator. *Dr. Viola Maskelene ‚Äì an Egyptologist, love interest, later \\"just friends\\" forever and always as concluded in Two Graves. *The Monks of the Gsalrig Chongg Monastery. *Eli Glinn ‚Äì president of Effective Engineering Solutions, Inc. Expert profiler who gets Pendergast to talk about his childhood and his brother. Also breaks Pendergast out of prison; also featured in The Ice Limit and the Gideon Crew series, beginning with Gideon's Sword. *Corrie Swanson ‚Äì from Medicine Creek, Kansas, assisted Pendergast on a case in Still Life with Crows. Previously enrolled at Phillips Exeter Academy; now enrolled at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (as of Cold Vengeance). Main character in White Fire. *Maurice ‚Äì Former Caretaker of the Pendergast family mansion, Penumbra, in Louisiana, which has been sold. *Kyoko Ishimura ‚Äì Pendergast's maid in the Dakota apartment. *Mrs. Trask - The housekeeper of Pendergast's mansion at 891 Riverside Drive. The Pendergast family Officially, much of the Pendergast's family wealth came from pharmaceuticals, and the family was sufficiently old and established in New Orleans to conduct themselves as aristocracy. However, there are hints that much of the fortune actually came from patent medicine (\\"snake oil\\"), and that some of the family's customers suffered permanent injury or even death from its effects. Pendergast also confides, to his shame, that a streak of insanity has afflicted his family for generations, such that many of them have been convicted of horrible crimes, and ended their lives in asylums. *Diogenes Dagrepont Bernoulli Pendergast ‚Äì Pendergast's younger brother (born circa 1962). As intelligent as Aloysius, if not more so, but allegedly criminally insane. Although he was always a unique child, Diogenes was pushed over the edge during a traumatic event during their childhoods, resulting in brain damage, heterochromia iridis, the inability to see colors, and the inability to sleep normally. Diogenes is first mentioned in Brimstone, after which he commits a series of grisly murders, for which he frames Aloysius, then a daring theft from the New York Museum of Natural History, to be completed with a horrific mass murder under circumstances similar to the \\"Event\\" during his childhood. Aloysius breaks out of prison with the help of his allies, only clearing his name later, and thwarts Diogenes' last crime. The three novels Brimstone, Dance of Death, and The Book of the Dead make up an internal series about the unique fraternal relationship between Aloysius and Diogenes, culminating in the latter's fall into the Sciara del Fuoco in the Stromboli volcano. These are known as the \\"Diogenes Trilogy\\". Sherlock Holmes fans will undoubtedly recognize Preston's and Child's homage to Doyle's famous works, in both their choice of first name for Aloysius Pendergast's brother, and in the circumstances of Diogenes's presumed demise. Diogenes reappears, seemingly a changed man in The Obsidian Chamber, claiming that he wants to live out a long, quiet life with Constance at Halcyon Key. After leading him on and joining him at Halcyon, Constance gives Diogenes a humiliating refusal, part of her cruel plan to get revenge; his whereabouts are currently unknown. *Cornelia Delamere Pendergast ‚Äì Pendergast's great-aunt, who poisoned her husband, brother and children. Cornelia held residence at the Mount Mercy Hospital for the Criminally Insane until her death. Despite her complete insanity, Pendergast still considered her wise, and sought her counsel when he had a dilemma. Sometime during the events of Fever Dream, Cornelia dies, leaving Pendergast a letter of unknown content. *Antoine Leng Pendergast (a.k.a. Enoch Leng) ‚Äì Pendergast's great- grand uncle. Traveled north to New York after being expelled from the Pendergast family because of his pursuit of \\"unaccepatble\\" and heinous acts involving obeah and voudou (according to Aunt Cornelia). Taxonomist and chemist as well as a member of the New York Lyceum in the late 19th century. Exposed as a serial killer in The Cabinet of Curiosities who killed in the pursuit of a substance that would prolong his life. He succeeded, and survived well into the late 20th century until he was murdered in his home on Riverside Drive. Pendergast now lives in Leng's old mansion with Proctor as butler/chauffeur and Mrs. Trask, the housekeeper. He has refurnished the mansion and made it liveable and elegant, though dim, as the shutters are always closed. *Hezekiah Pendergast ‚Äì (Pendergast's great-great grandfather) Antoine's father. Was a traveling salesman who contributed greatly to the family fortune by selling a quack medicine known as \\"Hezekiah's Compound Elixir and Glandular Restorative\\". The tonic was eventually exposed as a lethal blend of cocaine, acetanilid, and alkaloid botanicals. It was the cause of uncounted addictions and deaths, including that of Hezekiah's wife and Antoine's mother, Constance Leng Pendergast. *Henri Pendregast de Mousqueton ‚Äì a \\"seventeenth-century mountebank who pulled teeth, performed magic and comedy, and practiced quack medicine.\\" *Eduard Pendregast ‚Äì a \\"well-known Harley Street doctor in eighteenth-century London.\\" *Comstock Pendergast ‚Äì Pendergast's great-grand uncle. Famed mesmerist, magician, and mentor to Harry Houdini. Eventually murdered his business partner and his family. He then committed suicide by cutting his throat twice. *Linnaeus Pendergast ‚Äì Pendergast's father, who was killed in the fire. *Isabella Pendergast ‚Äì Pendergast's mother, also killed in the fire. Her maiden name is Fawcett (in \\"Two Graves\\", Pendergast assumes a fake identity, and calls himself \\"Fawcett\\"). *Boethius Pendergast ‚Äì Pendergast's great-grandfather. Lived at the Penumbra plantation about an hour outside New Orleans, was good friends with famed naturalist painter John James Audubon (However, in Fever Dream it is also mentioned that it was Pendergast's great-great-grandfather who was friends with Audubon. Furthermore, in Blue Labyrinth it is mentioned that Pendergast's great-great-great-grandfather was friends with Audubon.). *Helen Pendergast ‚Äì Pendergast's deceased wife (maiden name Helen Esterhazy). Helen was a doctor with Doctors With Wings, a group similar to Doctors Without Borders that travels to third-world countries and disaster areas to help people who would have otherwise had little chance of survival. She is a skilled big game hunter, and it was one of the activities that she and Pendergast did together. For many years, she was thought to have been killed on an African safari, but she reappears in the book Cold Vengeance. Helen is killed in the next installment of the series \\"Two Graves.\\" She is a descendant of the Hungarian Esterh√°zy aristocratic family. *Judson Esterhazy ‚Äì Pendergast's brother-in-law. A neurosurgeon and avid game hunter, lived in Savannah, Georgia. Like his sister Helen, he was a doctor with Doctors With Wings and was a skilled hunter. He plays an important role in the \\"Helen Trilogy\\" but was killed in \\"Two Graves.\\". *Percy Harrison Fawcett ‚Äì Pendergast's great-great uncle on his mother's side. He was an explorer and disappeared in the jungles along the Upper Xingu River (hence Pendergast's middle name) in 1925 while looking for the mysterious Lost City of Z. *Tristram ‚Äì Pendergast's son with Helen. Pendergast learns of him, and Alban, when they are 15 years old, in \\"Two Graves.\\" Tristram, the name chosen by Pendergast, attends boarding school at √âcole M√®re-√âgliseq in St. Moritz, Switzerland. *Alban ‚Äì Identical twin of Tristram, a genetically engineered person, more intelligent and stronger than his father. Deceased as of the events in Blue Labyrinth (2014). *Unnamed nephew - a child of Diogenes Pendergast and Constance Greene, born at and raised by the monks of the Gsalrig Chongg monastery, he is the 19th rinpoche. He was spirited away to India, by monks with the help of Pendergast and Constance, to protect him from enemies of Tibet. Chronicles Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast appears in several stand-alone novels and stars in two trilogies. All of these books have been jointly written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. =Stand-alone novels= *Relic (1995) (Pendergast's first appearance) ‚Äì Pendergast investigates a series of strange murders and rumors of a murderous beast in the New York Museum of Natural History. Includes Margo Green, reporter Bill Smithback, and Vincent D'Agosta. *Reliquary (1997) ‚Äì Pendergast returns to New York when a new string of murders surfaces resembling those of the Museum Beast case. He is again teamed with Margo Green, Dr. Frock, William Smithback Jr., and Vincent D'Agosta (all of whom were in the previous book), and introduces the character of Laura Hayward. *The Cabinet of Curiosities (2002) ‚Äì Pendergast is drawn to the remains of a 19th-century charnel house, unearthed at a construction site in New York and finds himself investigating a new series of 20th century copycat killings. He is joined by William Smithback Jr. and Dr. Nora Kelly. *Still Life with Crows (2003) ‚Äì Pendergast, while on vacation, travels to midwestern Kansas to the dying farm town of Medicine Creek to investigate a series of brutal and ritualistic killings. He teams up with a teenage malcontent, Corrie Swanson, to solve the case. The book also hints at a sequel to The Ice Limit. *The Wheel of Darkness (2007) ‚Äì Pendergast has taken Constance on a whirlwind Grand Tour, after the conclusion of her vengeful pursuit of Diogenes, hoping to give her closure and a sense of the world that she's missed. They head to Tibet, where Pendergast intensively trained in martial arts and spiritual studies. At a remote monastery, they learn that a rare and dangerous artifact the monks have been guarding for generations has been mysteriously stolen. Pendergast agrees to take up the search. The trail leads him and Constance to the maiden voyage of the Brittania, the world's largest and most luxurious passenger liner‚Äîand to an Atlantic crossing fraught with terror. *Cemetery Dance (2009) ‚Äì Pendergast returns to New York City. Two of his close friends have been attacked by a man who is supposedly dead. Pendergast and D'Agosta undertake a private quest for the truth. Their serpentine journey takes them into a part of Manhattan they never imagined could exist: a secretive and deadly hotbed of Obeah, the West Indian Zombi cult of sorcery and magic. *White Fire (2013) ‚Äì Corrie Swanson sets out to solve a long-forgotten mystery. In 1876, in a remote mining camp called Roaring Fork in the Colorado Rockies, several miners were killed in devastating grizzly bear attacks. Now the town has become an exclusive ski resort and its historic cemetery has been dug up to make way for development. Corrie has arranged to examine the remains of the dead miners. But in doing so she makes a discovery that threatens the resort's very existence. The town's leaders, trying to stop her from exposing their community's dark and bloody past, arrest and jail her. Corrie writes to Pendergast, who has taken a year's leave of absence (after the events of the Helen Trilogy) about her project. Pendergast arrives in Colorado a week or two before Christmas to help‚Äîjust as a series of brutal arson attacks on multimillion-dollar homes terrify the town and drive away tourists. Drawn into the investigation, Pendergast discovers an unlikely secret in Roaring Fork's past, connecting the resort to a meeting between Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Oscar Wilde. *Blue Labyrinth (2014) ‚Äì Pendergast must accept a ruthless killer's challenge when somebody leaves his son Alban's body at the door of his mansion. Contained in Alban's stomach is a rare turquoise that came from a long-deserted mine in California. Pendergast knows he must go there, although he's probably walking into a trap. Sure enough, despite all his precautions, he is exposed to a slow-acting poison Hezekiah's formula, which killed many peoplethat quickly begins killing him. *Crimson Shore (2015) ‚Äì Pendergast, with his ward Constance Greene, travels to the quaint seaside village of Exmouth, Massachusetts, to investigate the theft of a priceless wine collection. But inside the wine cellar, they find something considerably more disturbing: a bricked-up niche that once held a crumbling skeleton. Pendergast and Constance soon learn that Exmouth is a town with a troubled history, and this skeleton may be only the first hint of an ancient transgression, which is now kept secret. Local legend holds that during the 1692 witch trials in Salem, the real witches escaped, fleeing north to Exmouth and settling deep in the surrounding salt marshes, where they continued to practice their arts. Then, a murdered corpse turns up in the marshes. The only clue is a series of mysterious carvings. Could these symbols bear some relation to the ancient witches' colony, long believed to be abandoned? *The Obsidian Chamber (2016) *City of Endless Night (2018) *Verses for the Dead (2018) *Crooked River (2020) =The Diogenes trilogy= *Brimstone (2004) (Book One) ‚Äì The murder of a notorious art critic triggers a wave of panic when reporter Bryce Harriman runs a sensationalised story claiming the death is the work of the devil incarnate. Pendergast takes an interest in the case, and with D'Agosta at his side, follows the killer to Italy. There they discover the existence of a legendary Stradivarius violin, and a ruthless Italian count who will stop at nothing to claim it for himself. *Dance of Death (2005) (Book Two) ‚Äì With Pendergast missing and presumed to be dead, Vincent D'Agosta returns to New York City to fulfill Pendergast's last request: to stop his brother, Diogenes, from carrying out the perfect crime. But when Pendergast is rescued and nursed back to health by his brother, he realises that Diogenes' scheme is far more chilling than he first thought. *The Book of the Dead (2006) (Book Three) ‚Äì Diogenes Pendergast has been stopped for now, but Aloysius Pendergast has been sent to prison, awaiting trial for his life‚Äîassuming he lives long enough to be executed. As D'Agosta attempts to break him out of prison, Laura Hayward investigates a series of bizarre killings centred on the long-closed Tomb of Senef at the New York Museum of Natural History. Convinced that Aloysius is innocent, she begins to question Diogenes' involvement in the museum, and the terrifying crime he plans to commit in front of the eyes of the world. =The Helen trilogy= *Fever Dream (2010) (Book One) ‚Äì Pendergast inadvertently discovers evidence that his wife Helen's death twelve years previously was not the accident that he had believed it to be. He and D'Agosta follow the trail of evidence from the plains of Africa to the Louisiana bayou, untangling a conspiracy as they go and discover startling truths about Helen's life. *Cold Vengeance (2011) (Book Two) ‚Äì The conspiracy that murdered his wife is no more, but Pendergast will not rest until every person involved is brought to justice. Chasing the final conspirator across the moors of Scotland, Pendergast stumbles into a greater danger than he ever knew existed: the Covenant (\\"Der Bund\\" in German), a network of Nazis and Nazi sympathisers that have retreated from public view to influence events on a global scale. Corrie Swanson, on her own, still a student at John Jay, helps uncover part of the conspiracy. *Two Graves (2012) (Book Three) ‚Äì Pendergast's bloodlust continues as he chases those responsible for the abduction of Helen, who was revealed to have been alive and well for the past twelve years at the climax of Cold Vengeance. But a new threat intrudes upon Pendergast's chase: a serial killer who holds New York City in the grip of terror. Pendergast learns that he has two 15-year old sons, twins, that Helen never spoke of. =Short stories= *\\"Extraction\\" (2009) ‚Äì Pendergast tells the story of how Diogenes and he encountered a local urban legend as children, a man acting as the Tooth Fairy. *\\"Gaslighted: Slappy the Ventriloquist Dummy vs. Aloysius Pendergast\\" (2014) (written with R. L. Stine) ‚Äì Pendergast wakes up in Stony Mountain Sanatorium and confronts himself with a great dilemma: Is Slappy the Dummy part of his dream? Or is reality itself the dream of an insane man? =Proposed television adaptation= On February 1, 2016, authors Preston and Child confirmed that producer Gale Anne Hurd would be heading a television adaptation of the novels Relic and Cabinet of Curiosities. The adaptation, simply titled Pendergast, would air on Spike TV. The first season would focus on \\"Pendergast investigating a present-day crime mimicking a century-old mystery ‚Äî that links to his own family's dark past.\\" On November 8, 2017 Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child posted on their Facebook page that the series, under development at Paramount, was cancelled.

Dynamic frequency scaling helps preserve battery on mobile devices\\"A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems\\", IJCAET, 2014 and decrease cooling cost and noise on quiet computing settings, or can be useful as a security measure for overheated systems (e.g. after poor overclocking). Dynamic frequency scaling is used in all ranges of computing systems, ranging from mobile systems to data centers\\"Power Management Techniques for Data Centers: A Survey\\", ORNL Technical Report, 2014 to reduce the power at the times of low workload. Throttling is also known as \\"automatic underclocking\\". Automatic overclocking (boosting) is also technically a form of dynamic frequency scaling, but it's relatively new and usually not discussed with throttling.  Functioning  The dynamic power (switching power) dissipated per unit of time by a chip is C¬∑V2¬∑A¬∑f, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle, V is voltage, A is the Activity Factor indicating the average number of switching events undergone by the transistors in the chip (as a unit-less quantity) and f is the switching frequency. Voltage is therefore the main determinant of power usage and heating. The voltage required for stable operation is determined by the frequency at which the circuit is clocked, and can be reduced if the frequency is also reduced.https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotpower/tech/full_papers/LeSueur.pdf Dynamic power alone does not account for the total power of the chip, however, as there is also static power, which is primarily because of various leakage currents. Due to static power consumption and asymptotic execution time it has been shown that the energy consumption of a piece of software shows convex energy behavior, i.e., there exists an optimal CPU frequency at which energy consumption is minimal. Leakage current has become more and more important as transistor sizes have become smaller and threshold voltage levels lower. A decade ago, dynamic power accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total chip power. The power loss due to leakage currents in contemporary CPUs and SoCs tend to dominate the total power consumption. In the attempt to control the leakage power, high-k metal-gates and power gating have been common methods. Dynamic voltage scaling is another related power conservation technique that is often used in conjunction with frequency scaling, as the frequency that a chip may run at is related to the operating voltage. The efficiency of some electrical components, such as voltage regulators, decreases with increasing temperature, so the power usage may increase with temperature. Since increasing power use may increase the temperature, increases in voltage or frequency may increase system power demands even further than the CMOS formula indicates, and vice versa. Performance impact Dynamic frequency scaling reduces the number of instructions a processor can issue in a given amount of time, thus reducing performance. Hence, it is generally used when the workload is not CPU-bound. Dynamic frequency scaling by itself is rarely worthwhile as a way to conserve switching power. Saving the highest possible amount of power requires dynamic voltage scaling too, because of the V2 component and the fact that modern CPUs are strongly optimized for low power idle states. In most constant-voltage cases, it is more efficient to run briefly at peak speed and stay in a deep idle state for longer time (called \\"race to idle\\" or computational sprinting), than it is to run at a reduced clock rate for a long time and only stay briefly in a light idle state. However, reducing voltage along with clock rate can change those trade-offs. A related-but-opposite technique is overclocking, whereby processor performance is increased by ramping the processor's (dynamic) frequency beyond the manufacturer's design specifications. One major difference between the two is that in modern PC systems overclocking is mostly done over the Front Side Bus (mainly because the multiplier is normally locked), but dynamic frequency scaling is done with the multiplier. Moreover, overclocking is often static, while dynamic frequency scaling is always dynamic. Software can often incorporate overclocked frequencies into the frequency scaling algorithm, if the chip degradation risks are allowable. Implementations Intel's CPU throttling technology, SpeedStep, is used in its mobile and desktop CPU lines. AMD employs two different CPU throttling technologies. AMD's Cool'n'Quiet technology is used on its desktop and server processor lines. The aim of Cool'n'Quiet is not to save battery life, as it is not used in AMD's mobile processor line, but instead with the purpose of producing less heat, which in turn allows the system fan to spin down to slower speeds, resulting in cooler and quieter operation, hence the name of the technology. AMD's PowerNow! CPU throttling technology is used in its mobile processor line, though some supporting CPUs like the AMD K6-2+ can be found in desktops as well. VIA Technologies processors use a technology named LongHaul (PowerSaver), while Transmeta's version was called LongRun. The 36-processor AsAP 1 chip is among the first multi-core processor chips to support completely unconstrained clock operation (requiring only that frequencies are below the maximum allowed) including arbitrary changes in frequency, starts, and stops. The 167-processor AsAP 2 chip is the first multi-core processor chip which enables individual processors to make fully unconstrained changes to their own clock frequencies. According to the ACPI Specs, the C0 working state of a modern-day CPU can be divided into the so- called \\"P\\"-states (performance states) which allow clock rate reduction and \\"T\\"-states (throttling states) which will further throttle down a CPU (but not the actual clock rate) by inserting STPCLK (stop clock) signals and thus omitting duty cycles.

It is not the same camera as the slightly lower-specified \\"Pentax Program A\\" (which also had an alternative name, the \\"Pentax Program Plus\\".) The camera offers fully automatic exposure (\\"program\\") mode when coupled with an appropriate Pentax-A series lens. With such a lens the camera also offers shutter-priority mode, and with any compatible lens (i.e. Pentax-M lenses in addition to the Pentax-A series) the camera offers aperture-priority and fully manual modes. The shutter speeds, selected by up/down buttons rather than the conventional wheel, run from 1/2000 of a second to 15 seconds, plus a \\"bulb\\" mode. There is flash synchronisation at 1/125 of a second. Unlike the camera's most direct predecessor, the semi-automatic Pentax ME-Super, this model cannot function at 1/125 of a second, or at all, once the batteries have been exhausted. Speed is displayed on an LCD panel on the top of the camera adjacent to the buttons (which also shows whether the camera is cocked), and both speed and aperture are visible on LCD displays inside the viewfinder. These receive natural light through a translucent plastic window on the pentaprism housing and can be electrically lit at the press of a button. Also in the viewfinder, centred, is a split image focus aid surrounded by a microprism ring. A further improvement over the ME Super was the inclusion of a depth-of-field preview lever. The camera also featured a self-timer, which was electronic rather than the manual lever of its predecessors. The available ISO film speed choices were extended too, and run from 6 to 3200 ASA. As with the previous M series cameras, there is a window next to the winder arm which indicated film movement, and assists the user in rewinding film into the cassette without losing the tip of the film. Metering is through the lens. Camera also features direct TTL flash metering. The Super A version was available with a black top-plate (and matching base), the Super Program version was available with a chrome-coloured top-plate (and matching base). The main body, plastic grip, and lenses were always black. The European camera of the year version(1983) had a small round brass plate on the front lefthand side of the body. This all came with a lens cap and strap with the European camera of the year insignia.

Description Elta's Flight Guard is a missile detection and avoidance system that is installed on more than 200 military aircraft and helicopters as well as on several VIP commercial aircraft, and has been also installed in aircraft of the El Al, Arkia and Israir fleets that fly to high risk destinations. In September 2003, a year after an attempt was made to shoot down an Arkia Israel Airlines Boeing 757 in Mombasa, Kenya in 2002, the Israeli Ministry of Transportation selected Elta Systems to perform advanced flight tests of Flight Guard for protecting its commercial aircraft. Part of the funding was used to obtain certification of the system by Israel's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The system chosen comprised a radar-based missile approach warning system (MAWS) and countermeasure dispensing system. The system was chosen since it is specifically designed to defend low-flying aircraft against MANPADs, such as those utilized in the attack in Kenya. The automated system uses doppler radar to detect incoming missiles, before firing IMI-designed civilian flares to decoy incoming infrared-homed missiles. Controversy The system has proved controversial, with both Switzerland and the FAA in the US raising fire hazard safety concerns. The Swiss have stated that any aircraft with the system installed will be grounded, despite uncovering a plot to down an El Al aircraft in that country; other European countries have indicated that they might follow suit. Future development Although Flight Guard was approved by the Israeli CAA and several other countries, the Israel authority decided to buy a laser-based jamming system called Multi-Spectral Infrared Countermeasure (MUSIC) which began development in 2008, that does not use flares. As of Nov 2009, few commercial aircraft have anti-aircraft missile protection systems, and these rely on flares as the countermeasure.

Armorial shield of the Clive family; the design used in the heraldic shield memorial to Percy Archer Clive in the House of Commons Percy Archer Clive, DL (13 March 1873 ‚Äì 5 April 1918) was a British army officer and Liberal Unionist Party politician. Percy Clive was the eldest son of Charles Meysey Bolton Clive of Whitfield, Herefordshire, by his marriage to Lady Katherine Feilding, daughter of William Feilding, 7th Earl of Denbigh. He was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards as a second lieutenant in 1891. He was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant of Herefordshire in December 1894, and was attached to the Niger Field Force from 1897 to 1899 based in Lagos, rising to the rank of captain. In May 1899 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He was elected to the Commons as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Ross division of Herefordshire in the \\"khaki election\\" of 1900, while fighting in the Second Boer War. He did not return to England to take his seat until February 1902, and in June that year was Private Secretary for Parliamentary purposes to Lord George Hamilton, Secretary of State for India. In December 1903 he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to E G Pretyman, Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty. He was unseated at the 1906 general election, which saw the Liberal Party win a landslide victory. He returned to Parliament at a by-election in January 1908, and remained Ross's MP until his death. Following a merger of the Unionist parties in 1912 he became a Conservative. He returned to the army in World War I and was wounded twice. Clive was awarded the Legion of Honour, and the Croix de Guerre, and was twice Mentioned in Despatches. As lieutenant- colonel of the Grenadier Guards he was killed in action when attached to the 1/5th Lancashire Fusiliers, 5 April 1918 at Bucquoy. Memorial services were held on 17 April at St Margaret's, Westminster and Hereford Cathedral. He is commemorated on the Arras Memorial. Clive is commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs that died during World War I to be named on that memorial. Clive is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript- style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes a short biographical account of the life and death of Clive. His elder son Major Meysey George Dallas Clive (1907‚Äì1943) was killed with the Grenadier Guards in North Africa on 1 May 1943. His younger son Lewis Clive (1910‚Äì1938) won a gold medal for rowing at the 1932 Olympics and was a member of the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War, killed in action in August 1938.

The company has gained wide recognition with its advertising campaign \\"Interpolis.Crystal clear\\". Besides financial compensation, Interpolis also offers compensation in kind. Interpolis Office Concept In addition to insurance, Interpolis is also known for its special outlook on work. No one at Interpolis has their own fixed place of work. The employees can select a place of work that is best suited to them and to the work that they do. Special areas called ‚Äòclub houses‚Äô have also been created at the Interpolis head office, each with its own particular atmosphere. In these club houses the Interpolis employees can combine various daily activities, such as working, consulting, meeting people, relaxing and eating. The flexible working concept, of Activity Based Working, led to a cultural transition at Interpolis. That is because flexible working is not just a matter of moving some furniture around. Flexible working must also become embedded in the way you think and act. Employees at Interpolis do not have to clock in. The motto at Interpolis is: as long as the work gets done. Whether that is done from home or at the office is something the employees can decide for themselves. Interpolis is a pioneer of teleworking in the Netherlands. At the moment about 2,500 employees work from home several days a week. History Interpolis came into existence in 1969 after a merger between the life insurance company BTL and four mutual non-life insurance companies: ABTB in Arnhem, LLTB in Roermond, LTB in Leiden and NCB in Tilburg (which were part of the regional class-based organizations of the Katholieke Nederlandse Boeren- en Tuindersbond (KNBTB) (Catholic Dutch farmers and market-gardeners union). Also in 1969 Interpolis, together with the Co√∂peratieve Centrale Boerenleenbank - a forerunner of the Rabobank -, founded the finance company DLL (formerly known as De Lage Landen). That organization is still a part of the Rabobank. Three other mergers followed: with Hagelunie (1972), De Twaalf Gewesten (1985) and Sterpolis (1993). In 1990 mergers between banks and insurance companies became permitted, after which the Rabobank acquired almost all the shares of Interpolis. The Catholic class-based organizations, united in the KNBTB, retained their controlling interest until 2000. After the merger with Commit Arbo (2000) and the take-over of Relan (2001), Interpolis expanded its insurance activities to include old-age provisions and absenteeism management. In 2005 Interpolis merged with Achmea, part of the European insurance group Eureko. The Rabobank exchanged Interpolis for 37% of the shares in Eureko. Since the merger Interpolis is part of Achmea, the largest insurance group in the Netherlands.

In March 1985, All The Way Back opened at the Abbey and was revived there in July 1985. In 1987 his social farce Say Cheese enjoyed an extended run at the Abbey, playing to full houses and described by the Irish Press as \\"a barrel of fun which gets the audience rolling in the aisles\\".Irish Press 12 May 1987 For the next five years, Farrell moved to television commissions and to writing his early radio plays. (See Television and radio drama section). When he returned to theatre in 1992, he entered a ten-year period in which his most critical and popular successes were produced. These began with 44 Sycamore, written for Red Kettle Theatre Company in 1992 which attracted glowing notices in its native Waterford - \\"a comic gem\\"Sunday Tribune 9 February 1992 from The Sunday Tribune and \\"a roaring success\\"Irish Press 18 February 1992 from The Irish Press - before continuing its success at Andrews Lane Theatre in Dublin and then onto a National Tour.

This was followed, in May 1993, by Farrell's return to the Abbey with what many reviewers and commentators then regarded to be one of his best plays: The Last Apache Reunion. Telling the story of a group of school friends who, in adulthood, return to their old, derelict school to celebrate a reunion, The Irish Times saw it as \\"a highly intelligent, tellingly perceptive, utterly devastating play, uncomfortably comic in its every turn\\".David Nowlan in The Irish Times 26 May 1993 The Sunday Tribune said that \\"school reunions have never been so funny, frightening and enjoyable\\"Sunday Tribune 20 May 1993 and The Guardian called it \\"Farrell's most accomplished\\".The Guardian 21 May 1993 The play enjoyed a very successful run at the Abbey, was revived there in November 1993 and then transferred to The Tivoli Theatre in 1994.

In 2010, Farrell returned to the Abbey with Bookworms, a satirical play set on the evening of a bookclub meeting. The play premiered in June 2010 where it played to full houses, the Sunday Independent having predicted in its review that \\"Bernard Farrell has done it again and probably better than ever - the Abbey has a sure-fire summer winner that deserves to become a perennial favourite\\".Emer O'Kelly in Sunday Independent 6 June 2010Bookworms was subsequently revived at the Abbey in February 2012.

It is known for being the oldest continuously run agricultural fair in North America.West Hants Historical Society It was first held on the grounds of Fort Edward beginning in 1765 and has been running continuously since 1815.The fair has been held at the nearby Hants Exhibition Arena and exhibition grounds since the land was purchased in 1949. September 2015 marked the 250th anniversary of the Hants County Exhibition. The Windsor Agricultural Society Hants County Exhibition Park is owned and operated by the Windsor Agricultural Society. The main goal of the society is to continue to host the agricultural exhibition annually. The main income of the society is through revenue made during the exhibition events, as well as renting the facilities during other times of the year. When available, the Society applies for federal and provincial grant programs. The Society consists of over 70 volunteer committee members and directors with six seasonal employees. The exhibition The Hants County Exhibition is held annually over two weekends in September. The fair hosts a wide range of activities to highlight agriculture. During the first weekend, local 4-H clubs of Hants County come together to showcase their projects they have worked on throughout the year and show off their animals they have raised and trained. These projects include Lifeskills such as cake decorating, crafts, foods, scrapbooking, photography, welding, small engines, great outdoorsmen and more. 4-H Livestock that are shown at the exhibition include dairy, beef, sheep, goat, light horse, mini horse, dog obedience, rabbit, poultry and waterfowl. Also during the first weekend, other livestock events are happening including draft horse classes, ox pulls, horse pulls, Maritime Barrel Racing and pole bending. The second weekend of the exhibition is also full of livestock and agriculture events. This includes the Classic Heritage Beef Show, which is the largest beef cattle show in the Maritimes drawing in over 200 head of beef cattle. Also during the second weekend, there are hunter and jumper classes held in the main arena, as well as western performance horse classes. During both weekends, there are numerous horticulture, vegetable, craft and art exhibits displayed. There are many local vendors set up and live music and events to watched and enjoyed. A large midway set up on the grounds for kids to enjoy over both weekends including amusement rides and carnival rides. For the remainder of the year, the exhibition grounds hosts many other events in their various buildings on the property including the main Exhibition Arena with 2,500 seats, 4 large barns, and other exhibit building. There is a pumpkin weigh-off featuring pumpkins grown with Atlantic Giant seeds. A hockey rink is on site home to the West Hants Warriors minor hockey. and is well used by the community. After the winter months, the ice is removed from the rink and replaced with sand to accommodate for equine events for Avon Pony Club and other equestrian society events. There is a large horse barn on site and a smaller riding arena for lessons and events.

Legal career He was called to the Nigerian Bar as a solicitor and advocate of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in November 1988 after completing the professional training programme at the Nigerian Law School, Lagos which he undertook between 1987 and 1988. His legal career of over one and a half decades, commenced in the law Firm of Sofunde, Osakwe, Ogundipe and Belgore, where he cut his legal teeth as a litigator over such wide-ranging areas of specialisation as, intellectual property (registration of trade marks), commercial law, covering general contracts, company activities, mergers, acquisitions, right issues, ownership of shares and equity of corporations, as well as land disputes, criminal law and chieftaincy matters, in all of which he has come to acquire appreciable expertise and vast experience. Fashola, a Notary Public of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, has been variously honoured with awards and certificates of merit including the Distinguished Alumnus Award conferred on him by the University of Benin Alumni Association in recognition of contributions to the Alumnus association and humanity. He is also a recipient of Lagos State public service club Platinum Award for outstanding contribution towards development. As well as Alliance for Democracy \\" Igbogbo Bayeku Local Government Award\\" in recognition of activities towards the success of the party. Babatunde Fashola is also a Patron of the Law Students Association of the University of Benin and he is the second law graduate from the University of Benin and the first member of the Nigerian Law School graduating class of 1988 to be conferred with the professional rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria. Fashola is also the First ever Chief of Staff to be so honoured. Babatunde Fashola is a member of the Nigerian Bar Association, the International Bar Association and an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria. Political appointments Fashola was Chief of Staff to his predecessor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Fashola had during his tenure as Chief of Staff also dubbed as the Honourable Commissioner to the Governor's office. Babatunde Fashola was the first person to hold both offices simultaneously. Babatunde Fashola also served in Lagos state in various capacities, including: * Secretary of the Lands Sub-Committee of the Transitional Work Groups. 1999. * Member of the panel of Enquiry into allocation of houses on the Mobolaji Johnson Housing Scheme at Lekki, 2000. * Member of the State Tenders Board- 2002‚Äì 2006. * Member of Lagos State Executive Council-2002-2006. * Member of the State Security Council-2002-2006 * Member of the State Treasury Board-2002-2006 * Chairman Ad-Hoc Committee on the Review of Asset distribution among Local Government. * Minister of Power, Works and Housing 2015-2019 *Minister of Works and Housing 2019 to date Governor of Lagos state Babatunde Raji Fashola commenced a four-year tenure as the Executive Governor of Lagos State in Nigeria on 29 May 2007. In June 2007, Babatunde Fashola appointed former Inspector General of Police Musiliu Smith head of the Lagos State Security council, a body charged with taking a holistic look at the anatomy of crime in the state. =Education reforms= Babatunde Fashola commissioning a university-style gate for Birch Freeman High School, in Surulere, on 4 February 2010. Babatunde Fashola vowed to rehabilitate the state's public schools, long being neglected with time. Among the schools being habilitated included the governor's alma mater, Birch Freeman High School, which is located at a busy metropolis of Surulere. =The Eko Mega City Project= The biggest task Babatunde Raji Fashola faced in office as Governor of Lagos State is his visionary project to transform Lagos into a mega city,Eko Akete Mega City the first of its kind in Lagosian history. Although initialised under the former governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in June 2002,About us , Eko Akete Mega City the mega project task accelerated under Fashola's governorship. Both private and public sectors are involved in fulfilling the project. Newly added toll gates and roads at the Lekki-·∫∏p·∫π Expressway. The crucial part of the mega city project is the rehabilitation of Lagos' infrastructures and districts. Formerly taken care of by the federal government, they were immediately neglected, as Abuja was declared Nigeria's new capital since 1991. According to Lagos Rail Mass Transit, proposed light railways will be consisted of the outskirt blue-line and inner red-line destinations.Overview , Lagos Rail Mass Transit As part of the project, the Badagry Expressway, which links Lagos directly to the south-eastern border of Benin Republic, is currently being rehabilitated by various contractors, with BRT and railway networks being established.Lagos Blue Line Urban Rail Concession , Lagos Rail Mass Transit Another ambition is to recover lands at Victoria Island, being lost to erosion for decades. This artificial terrain is the location of the proposed Eko Atlantic City. This is also to support housing project that would accommodate up to 25 million Lagosians by 2015, a population growth from 15 million that could turn Lagos into the world's third largest city. Ayodele Awojobi Memorial Park, Onike Round-about, Yaba, Lagos. In October 2009, Babatunde Fashola posthumously dedicated a garden personally, in honour of the memory of late professor Ayodele Awojobi at Onike Roundabout, Yaba, Lagos, with a statue of the famous academic erected at the centre. Artists of repute such as Oladejo Victor Akinlonu has commended the Governor on a job well done on the various value enhancement and beautification of Lagos state being a pioneer in the beautification of the state since the 80's Oladejo enjoined artists to work with the Governor Oladejo's works such as the eyo masquerade and the Bust of Sir Alexander Molade Okoya Thomas where commissioned by the Governor. =Haiti earthquake fund-raising= As soon as Haiti was struck by a magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake, Babatunde Fashola launched an appeal to raise up to one million US dollars. The funds raised were used to assist the victims of the Haiti quake. As this was in place, the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mr. Adeyemi Ikuforiji, said Nigerians should be prepared in events of natural disasters. = Water safety = In May 2014, Fashola announced the compulsory use of life jackets on Lagos waterways. In a 2012 accident, ten children from Ijora Awori, Lagos State, drowned while they were being ferried to school, because they were not wearing life jackets. Political limbo But in late January 2010, the Lagos State House of Assembly launched an investigation into possible mishandling of tax payers' money by Fashola, mainly on the ongoing mega city project. The accusations range from importing of palm trees from Niger, for gardening projects within a rain forest state, to improper usage of contract money involving one of Lagos State's contractors. The group carrying out the investigation was known as the \\"True Face of Lagos\\". The final reports were due to be submitted on 15 February 2010, During his tenure in office True Face of Lagos was later abolished. There were attempts to re-launch the probes through a petition, but they were again being turned down by the court. He was re-elected on 26 2011 and was sworn in as Governor for his second term in office on May 29, 2011; completing 8 years as a Governor.

He is the Warren M. Zapol Professor of Anesthesia at Harvard Medical School and at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and a practicing anesthesiologist at MGH. At MIT he is the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and professor of computational neuroscience, the Associate Director of the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and the Director of the Harvard‚ÄìMIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. Brown is one of only 19 individuals who has been elected to all three branches of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, as well as the first African American and the first anesthesiologist to be elected to all three National Academies. Biography Brown grew up in Ocala, Florida, where he attended Fessenden Elementary and Middle Schools, Osceola Junior High School and North Marion High School. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy, in Exeter, New Hampshire in 1974 after spending the second semester of his senior year at Exeter in the School Year Abroad Program studying Spanish in Barcelona, Spain. In 1978, he received his Bachelor of Arts (magna cum laude) in applied mathematics from Harvard College. Following graduation, Brown received an International Rotary Foundation Fellowship to study mathematics at the Institut Fourier des Math√®matiques Pures in Grenoble, France. Upon returning from Grenoble, he entered the Harvard Medical School MD/PhD Program. He received his Master of Arts in 1984 in statistics and his PhD in statistics in 1988 from Harvard University and his MD (magna cum laude) in 1987 from Harvard Medical School. Brown completed his internship in internal medicine in 1989 at the Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, a research fellowship in endocrinology at the Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital in 1992 and his residency in anesthesiology at MGH in 1992. In 1992, Brown joined the staff in the Department of Anesthesia at MGH and the faculty at Harvard Medical School. In 2005 he joined the faculty at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Currently, Brown is the Warren M. Zapol Professor of Anesthesia at Harvard Medical School, the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering at MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, a Professor of Computational Neuroscience at MIT. In addition to his professorial positions, Brown serves as the Director of the Neuroscience Statistics Research Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the co-director of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and an associate director of MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering & Science. Brown also works as an anesthesiologist at MGH. Scientific career Brown has published widely on topics in Computational Neuroscience and Anesthesiology. Brown is the principal investigator of the Neuroscience Statistics Research Laboratory at MGH and MIT, where he currently conducts his research. =Measuring time on the human biological clock= Brown developed statistical methods to characterize the properties of the human circadian system (biological clock) from core temperature data recorded under the constant routine and free-running and forced desynchrony protocols. Through the early part of his career, Brown collaborated with circadian researchers to apply his methods to answer fundamental research questions in circadian physiology. Brown‚Äôs statistical methods were critical for: estimating accurately the period and internal time on human circadian clocks from continuous core temperature measurement; showing that bright lights could be used to shift the phase of the human circadian clock; properly timed administration of light and dark periods could be used to realign the internal clocks of shift workers with external time; and that, contrary to beliefs at the time, the period of the human biological clock, like that of other animals, was closer to 24 hours rather than 25 hours. =Deciphering brain signals= Brown later focused his statistics research on developing signal processing algorithms and statistical methods for neuronal data analysis. He developed a state-space point process (SSPP) paradigm to study how neural systems maintain dynamic representations of information. For the analysis of neural spiking activity and binary behavioral tasks represented as multivariate or univariate point processes (0-1 events that occur in continuous time), his research produced analogs of the Kalman filter, Kalman smoothing, sequential Monte Carlo algorithms, and combined state and parameter estimation algorithms commonly applied to continuous-valued time series observations. Brown used the methods to: show that ensembles of neurons in the rodent hippocampus maintained a highly accurate representation of the animal‚Äôs spatial location; track the formation of neural receptive fields on a millisecond time scale; track concurrent changes in neural activity and behavior during learning experiments; decode how groups of motor neurons represent movement information; and track burst suppression in patients under general anesthesia. Brown applied the state-space paradigm to: analyze learning in behavioral neuroscience experiments; study the relationship between learning and changes in hippocampal function in humans; assess the efficacy of deep brain stimulation in enhancing behavior performance in humans and non-human primates; and define precisely changes in levels of consciousness under propofol-induced general anesthesia. With Partha Mitra, Brown co-founded and co-directed the Neuroinformatics Summer Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA from 2002-2006. He co-directs with Robert Kass the biannual Statistical Analysis of Neural Data Conference at the Carnegie Mellon University Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition. He co-authored a textbook in neuroscience data analysis with Robert Kass and Uri Eden. =Nature of general anesthesia= Unraveling the mystery of general anesthesia is another major question facing modern medicine. In 2004, Brown began a systems neuroscience research program to study the mechanisms of anesthetic action by forming and leading an interdisciplinary collaboration of anesthesiologists, neuroscientists, a statistician, a neurosurgeon, neurologists, bioengineers and a mathematician at MGH, MIT and Boston University. In 2007 he received an NIH Director‚Äôs Pioneer Award to support this research making him, the first anesthesiologist and the first statistician to receive this award. His anesthesiology research has made fundamental theoretical and experimental contributions to understanding the neurophysiology of general anesthesia. In two seminal papers, Brown provided the first systems neuroscience analysis of how anesthetics act at specific receptors in specific neural circuits to produce commonly observed altered arousal states. This analysis provided an essential missing link between the substantial body of research on the molecular pharmacology of anesthetic action and the behavioral responses commonly seen in anesthetized patients. Brown also shows that, contrary to common dogma general anesthesia is not sleep, but rather a reversible coma. Brown‚Äôs research group has provided detailed insights into how anesthetics produce unconsciousness. The brain is not shut off under general anesthesia. Instead, anesthetics induce highly structured oscillations between key brain regions. These oscillations, which are readily visible in standard electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, alter arousal by impairing normal communication between regions. This is analogous to what happens when an epilepsy patient loses consciousness with the appearance of the regular, hypersynchronous oscillations of a seizure. Anesthetic-induced oscillations are also akin to what happens when a hum in a phone line makes it impossible to sustain a normal conversation. Brown has performed many studies on the properties of propofol-induced anesthesia in particular. He found that propofol-induced unconsciousness is mediated simultaneously by two different oscillatory processes. The first is strong coherent alpha oscillations (8 to 10 cycles per second) between the cortex and the thalamus (26-28) and the second are strong incoherent cortical slow-wave oscillations (<1 cycle per second). The alpha oscillations impair communication between the thalamus and cortex. The slow-waves restrict to narrow time intervals the times at which cortical neurons can discharge, thus making it difficult to sustain communication within the cortex. Furthermore, each anesthetic has a different EEG signature reflecting different neural circuit mechanisms action. These signatures change with age and the anesthetic dose. A practical implication of this finding is that the EEG can be used in real time to monitor accurately the anesthetic state of patients. Brown‚Äôs group has developed an online teaching program to train anesthesiologists on this monitoring approach. Brown and colleagues are establishing a new paradigm for waking patients up following general anesthesia. They have shown that the anesthetic state can be rapidly reversed by administering methylphenidate (Ritalin) or activation of dopaminergic systems. This suggests a new, feasible way to actively restore cognitive function in patients after anesthesia and sedation. They have received FDA approval to undertake a clinical trial to test this idea in humans (NCT 02051452). They have also shown that burst- suppression, a state of profound brain inactivation seen in deep general anesthesia, hypothermia, coma and developmental brain disorders, can be simply explained by a unifying neural-metabolic model. Brown‚Äôs group have also shown that burst suppression can be precisely controlled to maintain a therapeutic, medically-induced coma. This research uses a closed-loop control system based on his SSPP paradigm. This could have important implications for treating patients, such as Gabrielle Giffords, Michael Schumaker, Malala Yousafzai and Joan Rivers, who sustain brain injuries or have intracranial hypertension and require a medically-induced coma to facilitate brain recovery. Brown's anesthesiology research has been featured on National Public Radio, in Scientific American, the MIT Technology Review, the New York Times and in TEDMED 2014\\\\. National committee service Brown has served on numerous national panels and advisory committees. Most recently he served on the NIH BRAIN Initiative Working Group. His current committee service includes being a member of the Burroughs-Wellcome Fund Board of Directors, the NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Advisory Committee, the NIH Council of Councils, the Board of Trustees of the International Anesthesia Research Society, the Scientific Advisory Committee of CURE Epilepsy and the Governing Council of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Awards and honors Brown has received a number of awards throughout his career, including: the Robert Wood Johnson Minority Medical Faculty Development Fellowship, an NSF Minority Career Development Fellowship, an National Institute of Mental Health Independent Scientist Award, the Jerome Sacks Award from the National Institute of Statistical Sciences for Outstanding Cross Disciplinary Research, an NIH Director‚Äôs Pioneer Award, an NIH Director‚Äôs Transformative Research Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists Award for Excellence in Research. Brown was named as one of America's leading doctors by Black Enterprise Magazine and was named one of Get Konnected's GK50 Boston‚Äôs 50 Most Influential People of Color in Healthcare & Life Sciences In 2018, Brown received the Dickson Prize in Science for his work on the statistical analysis of neuronal data and research on anesthesia. One of Carnegie Mellon's nominators, Professor Robert E. Kass, noted that Brown is the \\"world's expert on statistical analysis of neuronal data\\" and that Brown's work on anesthesia has been \\"truly transformative\\" for the field. Brown has presented several memorial lectures, including: the American Society of Anesthesiology's Lewis H. Wright Memorial Lecture and John W. Severinghaus Lecture in Translational Science and the Institute of Mathematical Sciences Medallion Lecture.

Their music is described by guitarist Dennis Rea as \\"an odd blend of jazz, rock, electronic, and world music.\\" Land was active from 1993 until 2001 and released three albums. In 1996 they toured China, Hong Kong, and Macau, including a performance at the prestigious Beijing International Jazz Festival. Overview =Members= *Jeff Greinke (1993‚Äì2001) *Dennis Rea (1993‚Äì2001) *Lesli Dalaba (1993‚Äì2001) *Ed Pias (1993‚Äì1996) *George Soler (1996‚Äì1997) *Bill Moyer (1996‚Äì1997) *Greg Gilmore (1996‚Äì1997) *Fred Chalenor (1998‚Äì2001) *Bill Rieflin (1998‚Äì2001) =Collaborators= *Tori Nelson-Zagar - acoustic bass (1994) *Scott Granlund - tenor saxophone (1994) *Wang Yong - guzheng (1996) *Doug Haire - mixing (1994), engineer (1996‚Äì2001), producer (1997) =Style= Land played a mixture of jazz, rock, ethnic/world music, and electronic music. Their first album and early performances tended to reflect Jeff Greinke's ambient music background. By 1997 their music had a much harder edge, best exemplified on their album Road Movies. History Land was formed by Jeff Greinke in 1993. Guitarist Dennis Rea and trumpeter Lesli Dalaba were the other original members of Land and they were soon joined by drummer Ed Pias. Greinke and Rea had met in 1982 when Rea was a member of Savant and had performed together that year. Land's first self-titled album was recorded in 1994 and released by the Australian label Extreme in 1995. The label describes the album Land on its website: \\"Elements of jazz, ethnic, dance and ambient music are all evident, as well as the Fourth World sound of Jon Hassell.\\" All of Land's albums started out as live radio broadcasts with, according to Dennis Rea, \\"...very little re-recording or cosmetic surgery after the fact, so they are accurate representations of the band's live sound.\\" A May, 1996 concert broadcast formed the basis for most of the second album, Archipelago. The group had expanded to a septet by that time, adding George Soler (Stick), and two additional percussionists: Greg Gilmore and Bill Moyer. It was this lineup, minus Ed Pias, who had left the group, that toured China in November‚ÄìDecember, 1996, performing in Beijing, Kunming, and Chengdu, as well as Hong Kong, and Macau. The tour included a performance at the Beijing International Jazz Festival. In addition, during the festival on November 12 Rea and Dalaba performed with guzheng virtuoso Wang Yong, Austrian violinist Andreas Schreiber, Dutch drummer Han Bennink, and Claudio Puntin and Steffen Schorn on horns at Keep in Touch, reportedly China's first internet cafe. The jam session produced a mixture of American style free jazz and European influenced improvisation blended at times with traditional Chinese music. The results were captured on the album Free Touching: Live in Beijing at Keep in Touch, which was released as a double CD in March 2004. Wang Yong also joined Land on stage for their concert in Hong Kong. \\"Deep\\", the final track for Archipelago, by the same lineup that had toured China, was recorded in February 1997, with finishing touches completed in July. The album was released on the Periplum label later that year. By 1998, Land had gone through a number of personnel changes and had developed a much harder-edged sound. Andrew Bartlett, writing in a 1999 article in Seattle Weekly, described the music at that time, in part: \\"LAND's sound is a swirl‚Äîa clicking, cascading, jolting mix of sonorities and styles.\\" Dennis Rea is quoted in the article: \\"\\"The current lineup is more of a 'rock' band than earlier editions, and is much more explosive and in-your-face. Our connection with ambient music is pretty tenuous at this point.\\" The final incarnation of the band, which recorded the album Road Movies between June, 1998 and February, 1999, included Greinke, Rea, Dalaba, drummer Bill Rieflin (now with R.E.M.), and bassist Fred Chalenor. Road Movies was not released until 2001 on the First World Music label. It was named one of the Top Ten releases of 2001 by Pulse! (Instrumental/Ambient) and the Seattle Weekly (Jazz). Lesli Dalaba also left the band in 2001 and the remaining members decided to amicably part ways.

Bush. She left her successful Michigan dental practice for a studio in Greenwich Village, New York City, and became a self-taught painter in the 1920s. She claimed her large surrealistic works were inspired by long-dead artists who were communicating with her from \\"beyond the veil.\\" Her predictions of the future, her unusual artwork, her work with the poor in New York City's Bowery, and her late life marriage to Bush incited much interest in the national press.  Early life and career Marian Spore Bush was born Flora May Spore in Bay City, Michigan, on October 22, 1878, to Melvin and Helen Miller Spore. She attended Western High School in Bay City graduating in 1895 and went on to Ann Arbor to graduate from the University of Michigan College of Dentistry in 1899. Flora opened a dental office in Bay City in 1901 and became the first female dentist in Bay County. She was widely appreciated \\"for her progressive and excellent work in the day when she fabricated inlays, crowns, bridgework, and dental plates in her own laboratory. She was also a pioneer in the field of periodontal dentistry.\\"Marian Neumeyer, in Women of Bay County, 1808-1980, ed. by Jean Totten Musinski Rezmer (Bay City, Mich: Museum of the Great Lakes, 1980), p. 24 According to her sister Belle Spore Tunison, \\"although a woman of varied interests, Mrs. Bush never had the slightest inclination towards art either theoretically or in practiceuntil after the death of her mother, Mrs. M. L. Spore, in 1919. She gave up her dental practice then and went to Guam to spend six months with her brother, Lieut. Comm. James Sutherland Spore, who was governor general at that time, and there she began her first painting.\\"\\"Dream Pictures Cause Flurry of Interest,\\" Bay City Times, April 24, 1938 After some further travels abroad, she settled in New York City and rented a studio in Greenwich Village.  Spiritualism and Painting  As Flora Marian Spore, \\"she became well-known for a new and unusual technique, sometimes using paint so thick it seemed as much sculpture as painting. Brilliant color, power, and an unquestioned sense of design of a new and mystic school brought her work to the attention of art critics who reviewed her paintings with interest and favor.\\" Flora Marian was \\"an early participant in an exploration of the field of extrasensory perception in collaboration with Dr. Walter Franklin Prince of the Boston Society for Psychical Research. She believed firmly in life after life and the ability of the dead to communicate with the living through mental means. She felt that her painting was inspired and her art guided by artists long dead,\\" perhaps originally introduced to her through the spirit of her deceased mother. Yet she insisted that she was not a spiritualist nor did she believe in physical mediumship. Harry Houdini, an arch-enemy of spiritualists, was fascinated by her artwork. In 1924, Houdini's remarks about her paintings were printed in the New York Sun: \\"It is a great exhibition. I am certain of Miss Spore's honesty. I have never excluded the possibility of supernatural intervention from my belief. I have been engaged in the exposure of criminal fakers‚Ä¶ there is no question of that here. Miss Spore has something beautiful and is conveying it to her fellow men.\\".Houdini's 1924 New York Sun quote was reprinted on Oct. 30, 1927 in the Boston Sunday Post Feature Section article, \\"Ghosts guide her hand when she paints,\\" by Uthai Vincent Wilcox. For the gallery opening itself: \\"Spirit Paintings Shown,\\" New York Times, Dec. 3, 1924, p. 23:6 Flora Marian Spore's paintings were exhibited in the most conservative and prestigious art galleries of New York City: Knoedler's, Wildenstein's, Grand Central Art GalleriesEdward Alden Jewell, \\"Mrs. Irving T.

First with her own money and then with the financial assistance of other benefactors, she personally dispensed such things as meal tickets, clothing, spectacles, false teeth, and wheelchairs.\\" She became known to the press as Lady Bountiful of the Bowery.\\"New Lady Bountiful Aiding the Bowery,\\" New York Times, Feb 21, 1930, p. 21:6; \\"Lady Bountiful Continues Her Aid,\\" New York Times, Feb. 25, 1930, p. 18:3; \\"Miss Spore to Continue Bread Line,\\" New York Times, Feb. 27, 1930, p. 4:5 While engaged in this work she met Irving T. Bush, founder and president of Bush Terminal Company in New York City, and Bush House in London. They were married in Reno on June 9, 1930, an hour after Bush's divorce from his second wife became final.\\"Irving T. Bush Weds Miss Marian Spore in Reno One Hour After His Wife Gets Divorce Decree,\\" New York Times, June 10, 1930, p. 1:6; \\"Milestones,\\" Time, Monday, Jun. 16, 1930 Shortly afterwards, Marian closed her soup kitchen, feeling that other relief agencies could handle the work more efficiently. Henceforth, Marian Bush split her life between acting the society hostess and being a practicing artist. In \\"symbolism and mood her paintings seemed to forecast world events and conditions. Early in the 1930s, her art took an entirely new trend. Up to this time her palette had been extraordinarily vivid. Now she seemed impelled to paint huge stark canvases in black and white, all of war or presaging war.\\"Grand Central Art Galleries, \\"News\\", July 1947 One example, entitled \\"New York City: When?\\" shows two airplanes and burning buildings amidst the skyscrapers of New York. Edward Alden Jewell, art critic for the New York Times, said of her 1943 New York exhibition, \\"I should be inclined to refer to her work in this field as that of a primitive mystic. The large black and white canvases seem at once crude and powerful‚Ä¶.All the war paintings are symbolic in nature. Their impact is sharp and disturbing. If accepted as manifestations of psychic phenomena, they are mysterious.\\"obituary, New York Herald Tribune, Feb. 25, 1946, p. 14 There was one exception to the trend of her later work. In 1942, Marian produced a series of small paintings of scenes from the island of Guam, where she stayed in the early 1920s while visiting her brother. The New York Times' art critic described these canvases as \\"high in key\\" and observed they \\"involve extensive use of impasto.\\" According to an art gallery newsletter, \\"these Guam paintings are delightful primitives, very colorful and full of the movement of the sea and palm trees.\\" Philanthropist As a wealthy Park Avenue (New York) resident, Marian Spore operated a soup kitchen for the poor and needy in New York City's Bowery section, beginning in 1927. By February 1930 she worked four months annually, from January until April, relieving a populace of unskilled labor. During the Great Depression a growing breadline formed a streetwide T from Second Avenue (Manhattan) to the Bowery. It extended for a city block and a half. Marian Spore distributed more than $1,300 weekly in meal tickets purchased from the Y.M.C.A. at 22 East Third Street. She provided alms for the feeble, the crippled, and the starving. Four tickets purchased for a nickel each made up the smallest semi-weekly ration. Spore added a small colored ticket which was paired with meal tickets. The colored ticket gave one admittance to a small headquarters composed of two rooms, located at 24 East Third Street. On the next day of distribution the ticket holder could enter the building where Spore spent two hours every Monday and Thursday. Inside the headquarters, converted from a squalid tenement, she carried out the distribution of pants, overcoats, shoes, and other clothing, which Spore bought from stores which sold to her.New Lady Bountiful Aiding The Bowery, New York Times, February 21, 1930, pg. 15. In February 1930 Spore left her Park Avenue apartment for several weeks. However, her chauffeur, a Y.M.C.A employee, continued to give out meal tickets and clothing to the disadvantaged.Miss Spore To Continue Bread Line, New York Times, February 27, 1930, pg. 4.  Writings and legacy  Marian wrote a semi-autobiographical book about her spirit paintings, entitled They, which was published posthumously in 1947 by the Beechhurst Press of New York. She also wrote numerous children's stories which have never been published. After Marian S. Bush's death in New York on Feb. 24, 1946, a large retrospective exhibition of her work was organized in New York City. Most of her works have not been seen in public since this exhibition more than 60 years ago. Most of her early paintings were sold to patrons, and many of her important works are still owned by her descendants. In her obituary, the New York Times reprinted the statement of Dr. Walter Franklin Prince, \\"for many years research and executive officer of the Society for Psychical Research, [who] has said of Mrs. Bush, 'She represents a very unusual and remarkable phenomena, at least part of which is quite beyond explanation by our present science. Her honesty and general character are beyond doubt...that she is able to state facts probably unknown to her to a degree beyond the limits of chance has been absolutely proved by me.

The railroad was chartered in 1899 by the Gold King Mining Co. to haul ore from the mines on Cement Creek to the Silverton smelters. It was 7.5 miles long and had .5 miles of spurs. It was leased by the Silverton Northern in 1910. (Mears leased the Silverton Northern in the same year and purchased the SN outright in 1915, although traffic was discontinued soon thereafter.) Construction began from the mainline of the SN on the north side of Silverton, and followed Cement Creek northward to the town of Gladstone. At one time, an extension to the Silver Lake Mine was proposed, but no further construction ever was accomplished.For detailed maps of the SG&N;'s route, see Blazek, Mike, \\"Narrow Gauge Workbook No. 16: Modeling the Silverton, Gladstone & Northerly.\\" The line served the Kendrick and Gelder (or Gilder) smelter, later run by the Ross Mining and Milling Co., the McKinley sawmill, the Boston & Silverton Milling and Reduction (Yukon Mill) site, the Anglo Saxon mine, the Mammouth Mine, the Henriette(a) mine, Fisher's sawmill, the Gold King mine and the Mogul mill.See Blazek. Following the ups and downs of the metals markets, the SG&N; was finally absorbed by the Silverton Northern Railroad in 1915, being operated as the Gladstone Branch. The line was dismantled between 1938 and 1942. The railroad accessed the Denver & Rio Grande and also the Silverton Northern (at Silverton).

There is a common confusion between \\"l√™n ƒë·ªìng\\" and \\"h·∫ßu b√≥ng\\" (which is the most prominent ritual of ƒê·∫°o M·∫´u). During a ceremony of \\"H·∫ßu B√≥ng\\" (lit. Serving the (Holy) Reflections), a priest or priestess would mimic the deities by dressing and acting like them. The priest is in full control of their body. A successful ceremony is one in which the priest feels the deities' essences but it does not mean the deities' spirits enter the priest's mortal body. As a religious leader authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities, the \\"thanh ƒë·ªìng\\" in ƒê·∫°o M·∫´u is more of the equivalent of a priest rather than a medium or a shaman. Overview The date of l√™n ƒë·ªìng rituals are typically planned to coincide with a festival, anniversary, or the inauguration of a Mother house, although rituals may also be performed at more informal occasions. Rituals are generally held in temples, pagodas or similarly sacred locations. Votive offerings‚Äîwhich may range from flowers, cakes and sweets to alcohol, cigarettes and jewelry‚Äîand, on certain occasions, even Coca-Cola cansCoca-Cola cans are used particularly for their colour, as noted in Kendall (2003): \\"The medium pays special attention to the color of the votive offerings, so that each spirit receives offerings that are the same color as the realm with which she or he is associated.\\" (p.261) Red is a colour associated with the \\"celestial sky palace\\", therefore the red cans are \\"appropriate offerings for spirits from the Heavenly Realm\\". (p. 260‚Äì261) ‚Äîmust be purchased. Mediums generally also purchase a number of different costumes to be worn during the ritual. Before the main ritual takes place, mediums undergo several days of purifying rituals, involving abstention from sexual intercourse and eating meat. The main ritual, which may last from two to seven hours, begins with petitions to Buddha and to the deities for permission to carry out the ritual, after which the medium seats him or herself (both men and women may act as mediums) in the middle of four assistants, whose job it is to facilitate the medium's incarnation of different deities and spirits. Specially trained musicians and singers will perform invocation songs to induce a trance in the medium, at which point he or she will be ready to incarnate different spirits. Assistants will help the medium don different costumes to match the particular gods they are incarnating; for example, if a practitioner is acting as a medium for a god who takes the form of a general, he or she may wear a general's robes, and perform a dance incorporating swords or other weapons. A medium may incarnate several gods during one session, changing his or her costume and adapting his or her movements to each. Musicians‚Äîsingers and instrumentalists‚Äîaccompany the practitioner, and shift from one musical style to the next depending on which god is being incarnated. When the dance is finished, the audience is allowed to approach the still-possessed medium to make offerings, petition the deity being incarnated in exchange for favours, or to have their fortune told. The medium offers sacred gifts in return, often in the form of joss sticks. History =Early development and practice= =Contemporary practice= During early Communist rule, the practice of l√™n ƒë·ªìng (and ƒê·∫°o M·∫´u in general) were seen as forms of superstition and proscribed, although practitioners continued to perform rituals in secret. In 1987, after a period of prohibition, the Vietnamese government relaxed restrictions on the practice of l√™n ƒë·ªìng, and it gradually saw a recurrence in popularity; in 2001, it was the subject of an international conference, and a foreign delegation was allowed to attend a festival at Ph·ªß Gi√†y in Nam ƒê·ªãnh Province. While practitioners are generally allowed to practice in private, government opposition to the practice still exists; in 2010, for instance, a government circular was enacted to curb certain forms of l√™n ƒë·ªìng practice, specifically formal l√™n ƒë·ªìng festivals.Circular No. 04/2009/TT-BVHTTDL, issued on December 16, 2009, sets forth regulations on \\"cultural activities\\" that expand on Decree No. 103/2009/ND-CP on the same subject. Clause 4, Article 3, Chapter II of the Circular states: \\"Cultural activities and services with superstitious contents [which are prohibited in the Decree] are those with contents of unnaturally bewitching others to adversely affect their consciousness, including making offerings to expel evil spirits, treating diseases through incantation, going into trances to make orders, telling fortune, resorting to sortilege, shaking divinatory wands, spreading prophesies, reciting incantation, exorcizing amulets to harm others for self-interest, burning votive papers in public places and other forms of superstition.\\" The Circular and Decree have been interpreted as forbidding the practice of len dong in formal public festivals. () L√™n ƒë·ªìng is performed throughout Vietnam, and also in places with significant populations of Overseas Vietnamese, such as the United States (notably in Silicon Valley, south of San Francisco, California), Italy, France and Australia. L√™n ƒë·ªìng can also be seen as the Vietnamese version of East Asian spirit mediumship practiced in places such as Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. Etymology The word 'ƒë·ªìng' or 'to≈ã' is believed to be an Austroasiatic lexicon. It means 'to dance (as if) under demonic possession' or shaman in Mon. In the Munda languages, it means 'to dance' in Sora and 'a kind of dance, drumming and singing connected with wedding ceremony' in Santali.The Austroasiatics in Ancient South China: Some Lexical Evidence http://tlmei.com/tm17web/1976a_austroasiatics.pdf See also *H√°t ch·∫ßu vƒÉn‚Äîinvocation songs used in the practice of l√™n ƒë·ªìng *ƒê·∫°o M·∫´u *Religion in Vietnam Notes and references ;Notes ;References External links *\\"L√™n ƒë·ªìng\\" (English) Category:Vietnamese folk religion ","title":"L√™n ƒë·ªìng"},{"id":"13892184","text":"Well completion is the process of making a well ready for production (or injection) after drilling operations. This principally involves preparing the bottom of the hole to the required specifications, running in the production tubing and its associated down hole tools as well as perforating and stimulating as required. Sometimes, the process of running in and cementing the casing is also included. After a well has been drilled, should the drilling fluids be removed, the well would eventually close in upon itself. Casing ensures that this will not happen while also protecting the wellstream from outside incumbents, like water or sand. Perforated Shoe Lower completion (downhole completion) This refers to the portion of the well across the production or injection zone. The well designer has many tools and options available to design the lower completion (downhole completion) according to the conditions of the reservoir. Typically, the lower completion is set across the productive zone using a liner hanger system, which anchors the lower completion to the production casing string. The broad categories of lower completion are listed below. =Barefoot completion= This type is the most basic, but can be a good choice for hard rock, multi-laterals and underbalance drilling. It involves leaving the productive reservoir section without any tubulars. This effectively removes control of flow of fluids from the formation; it is not suitable for weaker formations which might require sand control, nor for formations requiring selective isolation of oil, gas and water intervals. However, advances in interventions such as coiled tubing and tractors means that barefoot wells can be successfully produced. =Open hole= The production casing is set above the zone of interest before drilling the zone. The zone is open to the well bore. In this case little expense is generated with perforations. Log interpretation is not critical. The well can be deepened easily and it is easily converted to screen and liner. However, excessive gas and water production is difficult to control, and may require frequent clean outs. Also the interval cannot be selectively stimulated. =Open hole completion= This designation refers to a range of completions where no casing or liner is cemented in place across the production zone. In competent formations, the zone might be left entirely bare, but some sort of sand-control and/or flow-control means are usually incorporated. Openhole completions have seen significant uptake in recent years, and there are many configurations, often developed to address specific reservoir challenges. There have been many recent developments that have boosted the success of openhole completions, and they also tend to be popular in horizontal wells, where cemented installations are more expensive and technically more difficult. The common options for openhole completions are:  Pre-holed liner  Also often called pre-drilled liner. The liner is prepared with multiple small drilled holes, then set across the production zone to provide wellbore stability and an intervention conduit. Pre-holed liner is often combined with openhole packers, such as swelling elastomers, mechanical packers or external casing packers, to provide zonal segregation and isolation. It is now quite common to see a combination of pre-holed liner, solid liner and swelling *winky* elastomer packers to provide an initial isolation of unwanted water or gas zones. Multiple sliding sleeves can also be used in conjunction with openhole packers to provide considerable flexibility in zonal flow control for the life of the wellbore. This type of completion is also being adopted in some water injection wells, although these require a much greater performance envelope for openhole packers, due to the considerable pressure and temperature changes that occur in water injectors. Openhole completions (in comparison with cemented pipe) require better understanding of formation damage, wellbore clean-up and fluid loss control. A key difference is that perforating penetrates through the first 6-18 inches (15‚Äì45 cm) of formation around the wellbore, whilst openhole completions require the reservoir fluids to flow through all of the filtrate-invaded zone around the wellbore and lift-off of the mud filter cake. Many openhole completions will incorporate fluid loss valves at the top of the liner to provide well control whilst the upper completion is run. There are an increasing number of ideas coming into the market place to extend the options for openhole completions; for example, electronics can be used to actuate a self-opening or self-closing liner valve. This might be used in an openhole completion to improve clean-up, by bringing the well onto production from the toe-end for 100 days, then self-opening the heel-end. Inflow control devices and intelligent completions are also installed as openhole completions. Pre- holed liner may provide some basic control of solids production, where the wellbore is thought to fail in aggregated chunks of rubble, but it is not typically regarded as a sand control completion.  Slotted liner  Slotted liners can be selected as an alternative to pre-holed liner, sometimes as a personal preference or from established practice on a field. It can also be selected to provide a low cost control of sand/solids production. The slotted liner is machined with multiple longitudinal slots, for example 2 mm √ó 50 mm, spread across the length and circumference of each joint. Recent advances in laser cutting means that slotting can now be done much cheaper to much smaller slot widths and in some situation slotted liner is now used for the same functionality as sand control screens.  Openhole sand control  This is selected where the liner is required to mechanically hold back the movement of formation sand. There are many variants of openhole sand control, the three popular choices being stand-alone screens, openhole gravel packs (also known as external gravel packs, where a sized sand 'gravel' is placed as an annulus around the sand control screen) and expandable screens. Screen designs are mainly wire-wrap or premium; wire-wrap screens use spiral- welded corrosion-resistant wire wrapped around a drilled basepipe to provide a consistent small helical gap (such as , termed 12 gauge). Premium screens use a woven metal cloth wrapped around a basepipe. Expandable screens are run to depth before being mechanically swaged to a larger diameter. Ideally, expandable screens will be swaged until they contact the wellbore wall.  Horizontal open hole completions  This is the most common open hole completion used today. It is basically the same described on the vertical open hole completion but on a horizontal well it enlarges significantly the contact with the reservoir, increasing the production or injection rates of your well. Sand control on a horizontal well is completely different from a vertical well. We can no longer rely on the gravity for the gravel placement. Most service companies uses an alpha and beta wave design to cover the total length of the horizontal well with gravel. It's known that very long wells (around 6000 ft) were successfully gravel packed in many occasions, including deepwater reservoirs in Brazil. =Liner completions= In this case the casing is set above the primary zone. An un-cemented screen and liner assembly is installed across the pay section. This technique minimizes formation damage and gives the ability to control sand. It also makes cleanout easy. Perforating expense is also low to non-existent. However gas and water build up is difficult to control and selective stimulation not possible the well can't be easily deepened and additional rig time may be needed. =Perforated liner= Casing is set above the producing zone, the zone is drilled and the liner casing is cemented in place. The liner is then perforated for production. This time additional expense in perforating the casing is incurred, also log interpretation is critical and it may be difficult to obtain good quality cement jobs. =Perforated casing= Production casing is cemented through the zone and the pay section is selectively perforated. Gas and water are easily controlled as is sand. The formation can be selectively stimulated and the well can be deepened. This selection is adaptable to other completion configurations and logs are available to assist casing decisions. Much better primary casing. It can however cause damage to zones and needs good log interpretation. The perforating cost can be very high. =Cased hole completion= This involves running casing or a liner down through the production zone, and cementing it in place. Connection between the well bore and the formation is made by perforating. Because perforation intervals can be precisely positioned, this type of completion affords good control of fluid flow, although it relies on the quality of the cement to prevent fluid flow behind the liner. As such it is the most common form of completion... =Conventional completions= * Casing flow: means that the producing fluid flow has only one path to the surface through the casing. * Casing and tubing flow: means that there is tubing within the casing that allows fluid to reach the surface. This tubing can be used as a kill string for chemical injection. The tubing may have a ‚Äúno-go‚Äù nipple at the end as a means of pressure testing. * Pumping flow: the tubing and pump are run to a depth beneath the working fluid. The pump and rod string are installed concentrically within the tubing. A tubing anchor prevents tubing movement while pumping. * Tubing flow: a tubing string and a production packer are installed. The packer means that all the flow goes through the tubing. Within the tubing you can mount a combination of tools that will help to control fluid flow through the tubing. * Gas lift well: gas is fed into valves installed in mandrels in the tubing strip. The hydrostatic head is lowered and the fluid is gas lifted to the surface. * Single-well alternate completions: in this instance there is a well with two zones. In order to produce from both the zones are isolated with packers. Blast joints may be used on the tubing within the region of the perforations. These are thick walled subs that can withstand the fluid abrasion from the producing zone. This arrangement can also work if you have to produce from a higher zone given the depletion of a lower zone. The tubing may also have flow control mechanism. * Single-well concentric kill string: within the well a small diameter concentric kill string is used to circulate kill fluids when needed. * Single-well 2-tubing completion: in this instance 2 tubing strings are inserted down 1 well. They are connected at the lower end by a circulating head. Chemicals can be circulated down one tube and production can continue up the other. Completion components The upper completion refers to all components from the bottom of the production tubing upwards. Proper design of this \\"completion string\\" is essential to ensure the well can flow properly given the reservoir conditions and to permit any operations as are deemed necessary for enhancing production and safety. =Wellhead with situation control= This is the pressure containing equipment at the surface of the well where casing strings are suspended and the blowout preventer or Christmas tree is connected. =Christmas tree= This is the main assembly of valves that controls flow from the well to the process plant (or the other way round for injection wells) and allows access for chemical squeezes and well interventions. =Tubing hanger= This component sits in the upper portion of the wellhead, within the tubing head flange and serves as the main support for the production tubing. The tubing hanger may be manufactured with rubber or polymer sealing rings to isolate the tubing from the annulus. The tubing hanger is secured within the tubing head flange with lag bolts. These lag bolts apply a downward pressure on the tubing hanger to compress the sealing gaskets and to prevent the tubing from being hydrostatically or mechanically ejected from the annulus.https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/t/tubing_hanger.aspx Glossary of oil field =Production tubing= Production tubing is the main conduit for transporting hydrocarbons from the reservoir to surface (or injection material the other way). It runs from the tubing hanger at the top of the wellhead down to a point generally just above the top of the production zone. Production tubing is available in various diameters, typically ranging from 2 inches to 4.5 inches. Production tubing may be manufactured using various grades of alloys to achieve specific hardness, corrosion resistance or tensile strength requirements. Tubing may be internally coated with various rubber or plastic coatings to enhance corrosion and/or erosion resistance. =Downhole safety valve (DHSV)= This component is intended as a last-resort method of protecting the surface from the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons. It is a cylindrical valve with either a ball or flapper closing mechanism. It is installed in the production tubing and is held in the open position by a high-pressure hydraulic line from surface contained in a 6.35 mm (1/4\\") control line that is attached to the DHSV's hydraulic chamber and terminated at surface to an hydraulic actuator. The high pressure is needed to overcome the production pressure in the tubing upstream of the choke on the tree. The valve will operate if the umbilical HP line is cut or the wellhead/tree is destroyed. This valve allows fluids to pass up or be pumped down the production tubing. When closed the DHSV forms a barrier in the direction of hydrocarbon flow, but fluids can still be pumped down for well kill operations. It is placed as far below the surface as is deemed safe from any possible surface disturbance including cratering caused by the wipeout of the platform. Where hydrates are likely to form (most production is at risk of this), the depth of the SCSSV (surface-controlled, sub-surface safety valve) below the seabed may be as much as 1 km: this will allow for the geothermal temperature to be high enough to prevent hydrates from blocking the valve. =Annular safety valve= On wells with gas lift capability, many operators consider it prudent to install a valve, which will isolate the A annulus for the same reasons a DHSV may be needed to isolate the production tubing in order to prevent the inventory of natural gas downhole from becoming a hazard as it became on Piper Alpha. =Side pocket mandrel= This is a welded/machined product which contains a \\"side pocket\\" alongside the main tubular conduit. The side pocket, typically 1\\" or 1¬Ω\\" diameter is designed to contain gas lift valve, which allows flow of High pressure gas into the tubing there by reducing the tubing pressure and allowing the hydrocarbons to move upwards. =Electrical submersible pump= This device is used for artificial lift to help provide energy to drive hydrocarbons to surface if reservoir pressure is insufficient. Electrical Submersible Pumps, or ESPs, are installed at the bottom of the production tubing. Being electrically powered, ESPs require an electrical communications conduit to be run from surface, through a specialized wellhead and tubing hanger, to provide the required power to function. During installation, the power cable is spliced into the ESP then attached to the outside of the tubing by corrosion resistant metal bands as it is ran in the hole. Specialized guards, called cannon guards, may be installed over each tubing collar to prevent the cable from rubbing on the casing walls which can cause premature cable failure. Installation and workover processes require careful consideration to prevent any damage to the power cable. Like many other artificial lift methods, the ESP reduces the bottom hole pressure at the tubing bottom to allow hydrocarbons to flow into the tubing. =Landing nipple= A completion component fabricated as a short section of heavy wall tubular with a machined internal surface that provides a seal area and a locking profile. Landing nipples are included in most completions at predetermined intervals to enable the installation of flow-control devices, such as plugs and chokes. Three basic types of landing nipple are commonly used: no-go nipples, selective-landing nipples and ported or safety-valve nipples. =Sliding sleeve= The sliding sleeve is hydraulically or mechanically actuated to allow communication between the tubing and the 'A' annulus. They are often used in multiple reservoir wells to regulate flow to and from the zones. =Production packer= The packer isolates the annulus between the tubing and the inner casing and the foot of the well. This is to stop reservoir fluids from flowing up the full length of the casing and damaging it. It is generally placed close to the foot of the tubing, shortly above the production zone. =Downhole gauges= This is an electronic or fiberoptic sensor to provide continuous monitoring of downhole pressure and temperature. Gauges either use a 1/4\\" control line clamped onto the outside of the tubing string to provide an electrical or fiberoptic communication to surface, or transmit measured data to surface by acoustic signal in the tubing wall. The information obtained from these monitoring devices can be used to model reservoirs or predict the life or problems in a specific wellbore. =Perforated joint= This is a length of tubing with holes punched into it. If used, it will normally be positioned below the packer and will offer an alternative entry path for reservoir fluids into the tubing in case the shoe becomes blocked, for example, by a stuck perforation gun. =Formation isolation valve= This component, placed towards the foot of the completion string, is used to provide two way isolation from the formation for completion operations without the need for kill weight fluids. Their use is sporadic as they do not enjoy the best reputation for reliability when it comes to opening them at the end of the completion process. =Centralizer= In highly deviated wells, this component may be included towards the foot of the completion. It consists of a large collar, which keeps the completion string centralised within the hole while cementing. =Wireline entry guide= This component is often installed at the end of the tubing, or \\"the shoe\\". It is intended to make pulling out wireline tools easier by offering a guiding surface for the toolstring to re-enter the tubing without getting caught on the side of the shoe. Perforating and stimulating In cased hole completions (the majority of wells), once the completion string is in place, the final stage is to make a connection between the wellbore and the formation. This is done by running perforation guns to blast holes in the casing or liner to make a connection. Modern perforations are made using shaped explosive charges, similar to the armor-penetrating charge used on antitank rockets (bazookas). Sometimes once the well is fully completed, further stimulation is necessary to achieve the planned productivity. There are a number of stimulation techniques. =Acidizing= This involves the injection of chemicals to eat away at any skin damage, \\"cleaning up\\" the formation, thereby improving the flow of reservoir fluids. A strong acid (usually hydrochloric acid) is used to dissolve rock formations, but this acid does not react with the Hydrocarbons. As a result, the Hydrocarbons are more accessible. Acid can also be used to clean the wellbore of some scales that form from mineral laden produced water. =Fracturing= This means creating and extending fractures from the perforation tunnels deeper into the formation, increasing the surface area for formation fluids to flow into the well, as well as extending past any possible damage near the wellbore. This may be done by injecting fluids at high pressure (hydraulic fracturing), injecting fluids laced with round granular material (proppant fracturing), or using explosives to generate a high pressure and high speed gas flow (TNT or PETN up to ) and (propellant stimulation up to ). =Acidizing and fracturing (combined method)= This involves use of explosives and injection of chemicals to increase acid-rock contact. =Nitrogen circulation= Sometimes, productivity may be hampered due to the residue of completion fluids, heavy brines, in the wellbore. This is particularly a problem in gas wells. In these cases, coiled tubing may be used to pump nitrogen at high pressure into the bottom of the borehole to circulate out the brine.

Rev. Barclay Fowell Buxton (16 August 1860 ‚Äì 5 February 1946) was an English evangelical Christian missionary in Japan. Buxton was the son of Thomas Fowell Buxton and Rachel Jane Gurney and grandson of Sir Thomas Buxton, 1st Baronet. Barclay's grandmother was Hannah Gurney, sister to the Quakers Joseph John Gurney and Elizabeth Fry and the name Barclay stems from the Quaker family who founded Barclays Bank. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was ordained deacon in 1884 and priest (London) in 1885, From 1884 to 1887, he was curate of Onslow Square, and was then curate of Stanwix, Cumberland until 1889. In 1890, Buxton went to Japan as an independent missionary with the British Church Missionary Society. Within several weeks of his arrival over 700 people were attending his services and by the end of the first year seven churches had been founded around Matsue and Yonago. He invited Paget Wilkes to join him as a lay helper in 1897, and the two worked together in Western Japan, before returning to England. Together they founded the Japan Evangelistic Band, which was formally launched at the Keswick Convention in 1903, where Buxton and Wilkes were joined by a small group of friends who were interested in evangelism in Japan. At first the new mission was known as the One by One Band of Japan, but nine months after Keswick, the name was changed to Japan Evangelistic Band, (‚ÄúKyodan Nihon Dendo Tai‚Äù) in Japanese. Buxton worked with Wilkes in Japan for many years, and returned to England in 1917. He remained Chairman of the JEB until his death. Between 1921 and 1935, he was the Vicar of Tunbridge Wells. In 1937, he received three separate calls to go back to Japan for a last missionary effort at the age of 75. Beginning in Kobe, he spoke 125 times in 153 days in 19 areas of the country. Buxton married Margaret Maria Amelia Railton, daughter of William Railton, in 1886. They had four children, a daughter Rachel Jane, Godfrey Buxton crippled by a war injury who set up the All Nations missionary training college and succeeded his father at the JEB, Murray Barclay Buxton, and Alfred Barclay Buxton, who joined CT Studd in the Congo and married one of CT's daughters, Edith, and then served as a missionary in Abyssinia. Both Alfred and Murray died together at Church House, Westminster during the London bombings of 1940. He was an uncle of Arthur Buxton (1882‚Äì1958), Chaplain to the Forces and Rector of All Souls Church, Langham Place, Marylebone.\\"Buxton, Arthur\\", in Crockford's Clerical Directory (1930), p. 190 References Further reading * B.

In May 2005, Mayfield was inducted into the Texas High School Coaches Hall of Fame. Mayfield was born in Quitaque in Briscoe County in the lower Texas Panhandle to James Andrew Mayfield (1900‚Äì1993) and the former Irma Graves (1901‚Äì1984). He graduated from Quitaque High School and attended a year of college before he joined the United States Army during the Korean War. Upon his Army discharge, Mayfield finished college on the G.I. Bill of Rights. He played quarterback and received his bachelor's and master's degrees from West Texas A&M;, then West Texas State University, at Canyon, south of Amarillo. While in college, Mayfield met his future wife, Mary Jean Hoover (1929‚Äì2005), whom he wed in 1950. Mayfield began his head coaching career at Littlefield in Lamb County until he moved in 1958 to Borger in Hutchinson County. His 1962 Borger squad made the 4A state championship game, losing 26-30 to San Antonio Brackenridge. In 1965, Mayfield assumed the head coaching duties at Permian High School in Odessa in Ector County, where he started the school's winning tradition by beating San Antonio Lee 11-6 for the 1965 4A state championship, coining the name \\"father of mojo\\". Mayfield was only the fifth head coach in Texas' highest classification to win a state championship in his first year. Mayfield led Odessa Permian to the state finals on two other occasions, in 1968 and 1970, losing each time to Austin Reagan. In 1971, Mayfield succeeded legendary Joe E. Kerbel at his alma mater, West Texas A&M.; He had only mediocre success and left the university after the 1976 season with an overall record of 24‚Äì39‚Äì2. He retired from coaching in 1977 but returned in 1982 to coach at Levelland in Hockley County for six seasons. Mayfield's career high school coaching record was 178‚Äì71‚Äì8 (.708) In retirement, he was an avid hunter, fisherman, and golfer. Mayfield died in Lubbock of complications from Alzheimer's disease. Survivors included two sons, Stan Mayfield and wife Cindy of Lubbock and Steve Mayfield of Dallas; a daughter, Rhonne Gary and husband Dan of Amarillo; six grandchildren, Shane Stewart, Layne Mayfield, Charly Mayfield, Rory Mayfield, Reid Mayfield, and Andrew Mayfield; three great- grandchildren, Jordyn, Hunter, and Easton Stewart; a brother, Bill Mayfield of Amarillo; and a sister, Jimmie Richmond of Anson in Jones County, Texas. In addition to his wife, he was preceded in death by a brother, Graves Mayfield. According to his obituary, Mayfield's \\"reserved and gentle nature delivered a calm and respectful manner when directing his players. Players and coaches through the years have shared with family members his ability to inspire and change their lives by leading them to meet their potential, which brought them success on the field and in their lives.\\" Memorial services for Mayfield were held on October 5 at the Lake Ridge United Methodist Church in Lubbock, with the Reverend Don Caywood of Odessa officiating.

It is used in a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Coronary stents are now used in more than 90% of PCI procedures. Stents reduce angina (chest pain) and have been shown to improve survivability and decrease adverse events in an acute myocardial infarction. Similar stents and procedures are used in non-coronary vessels (e.g., in the legs in peripheral artery disease). Medical uses Diagram of stent placement. In A, the catheter is inserted across the lesion. In B, the balloon is inflated, expanding the stent and compressing the plaque. In C, the catheter and deflated balloon have been removed. Before-and-after cross sections of the artery show the results of the stent placement. angioplasty procedures with a few important differences. The interventional cardiologist uses angiography to assess the location and estimate the size of the blockage (\\"lesion\\") by injecting a contrast medium through the guide catheter and viewing the flow of blood through the downstream coronary arteries. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) may be used to assess the lesion's thickness and hardness (\\"calcification\\"). The cardiologist uses this information to decide whether to treat the lesion with a stent and if so, what kind and size. Drug-eluting stents are most often sold as a unit, with the stent in its collapsed form attached to the outside of a balloon catheter. Outside the US, physicians may perform \\"direct stenting\\", where the stent is threaded through the lesion and expanded. Common practice in the US is to predilate the blockage before delivering the stent. Predilation is accomplished by threading the lesion with an ordinary balloon catheter and expanding it to the vessel's original diameter. The physician withdraws this catheter and threads the stent on its balloon catheter through the lesion. The physician expands the balloon, which deforms the metal stent to its expanded size. The cardiologist may \\"customize\\" the fit of the stent to match the blood vessel's shape, using IVUS to guide the work.Intravascular Ultrasound - Angioplasty.Org It is critically important that the framework of the stent be in direct contact with the walls of the vessel to minimize potential complications such as blood clot formation. Very long lesions may require more than one stent‚Äîthe result of this treatment is sometimes referred to as a \\"full metal jacket\\". The procedure itself is performed in a catheterization clinic (\\"cath lab\\"). Barring complications, patients undergoing catheterizations are kept at least overnight for observation.Angioplasty 101 Angioplasty.Org Dealing with lesions near branches in the coronary arteries presents additional challenges and requires additional techniques. Risks Though the chances of having complications from a PCI are small, some serious complications include the development of arrythmias, adverse reactions/effects of the dye used in the procedure, infection, restenosis, clotting, blood vessel damage, and bleeding at catheter insertion site. =Re-occlusion= Coronary artery stents, typically a metal framework, can be placed inside the artery to help keep it open. However, as the stent is a foreign object (not native to the body), it incites an immune response. This may cause scar tissue (cell proliferation) to rapidly grow over the stent. In addition, if the stent damages the artery wall there is a strong tendency for clots to form at the site. Since platelets are involved in the clotting process, patients must take dual antiplatelet therapy starting immediately before or after stenting: usually an ADP receptor antagonist (e.g. clopidogrel or ticagrelor) and aspirin for up to one year and aspirin indefinitely. However, in some cases the dual antiplatelet therapy may be insufficient to fully prevent clots that may result in stent thrombosis; these clots and cell proliferation may sometimes cause standard (‚Äúbare-metal‚Äù) stents to become blocked (restenosis). Drug-eluting stents were developed with the intent of dealing with this problem: by releasing an antiproliferative drug (drugs typically used against cancer or as immunosuppressants), they can help reduce the incidence of \\"in-stent restenosis\\" (re-narrowing). = Restenosis = One of the drawbacks of vascular stents is the potential for restenosis via the development of a thick smooth muscle tissue inside the lumen, the so-called neointima. Development of a neointima is variable but can at times be so severe as to re-occlude the vessel lumen (restenosis), especially in the case of smaller-diameter vessels, which often results in reintervention. Consequently, current research focuses on the reduction of neointima after stent placement. Substantial improvements have been made, including the use of more biocompatible materials, anti-inflammatory drug- eluting stents, resorbable stents, and others. Restenosis can be treated with a reintervention using the same method. Controversy The value of stenting in rescuing someone having a heart attack (by immediately alleviating an obstruction) is clearly defined in multiple studies, but studies have failed to find reduction in hard endpoints for stents vs. medical therapy in stable angina patients (see controversies in Percutaneous coronary intervention). The artery-opening stent can temporarily alleviate chest pain, but does not contribute to longevity. The \\"...vast majority of heart attacks do not originate with obstructions that narrow arteries.\\" Further, ‚Äú...researchers say, most heart attacks do not occur because an artery is narrowed by plaque. Instead, they say, heart attacks occur when an area of plaque bursts, a clot forms over the area and blood flow is abruptly blocked. In 75 to 80 percent of cases, the plaque that erupts was not obstructing an artery and would not be stented or bypassed. The dangerous plaque is soft and fragile, produces no symptoms and would not be seen as an obstruction to blood flow.‚Äù A more permanent and successful way to prevent heart attacks in patients at high risk is to give up smoking, to exercise regularly, and take \\"drugs to get blood pressure under control, drive cholesterol levels down and prevent blood clotting\\".Kolata, Gina. \\"New Heart Studies Question the Value Of Opening Arteries\\" The New York Times, March 21, 2004. Retrieved January 14, 2011. Some cardiologists believe that stents are overused; however, in certain patient groups, such as the elderly, GRACE and other studies have found evidence of under-use. One cardiologist was convicted of billing patients for performing medically unnecessary stenting. Guidelines recommend a stress test before implanting stents, but most patients do not receive a stress test.A simple health care fix fizzles out, Kenneth J. Winstein, Wall Street Journal, Feb. 11, 2010.  Research  While revascularisation (by stenting or bypass surgery) is of clear benefit in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute symptoms (acute coronary syndromes) including myocardial infarction, their benefit is less marked in stable patients. Clinical trials have failed to demonstrate that coronary stents improve survival over best medical treatment. * The COURAGE trial compared PCI with optimum medical therapy. Of note, the trial excluded a large number of patients at the outset and undertook angiography in all patients at baseline, thus the results only apply to a subset of patients and should not be over-generalised. COURAGE concluded that in patients with stable coronary artery disease PCI did not reduce the death, myocardial infarction or other major cardiac events when added to optimum medical therapy. * The MASS-II trial compared PCI, CABG and optimum medical therapy for the treatment of multi-vessel coronary artery disease. The MASS-II trial showed no difference in cardiac death or acute MI among patients in the CABG, PCI, or MT group. However, it did show a significantly greater need for additional revascularization procedures in patients who underwent PCI.http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/circulationaha;115/9/1082 MASS-II 5yr follow-up. *The SYNTAX Trial SYNTAX trial 2005-2008 is a manufacturer-funded trial with a primary endpoint of death, cardiovascular events, and myocardial infarction, and also the need for repeat vascularization, in patients with blocked or narrowed arteries. Patients were randomized to either CABG surgery or a drug-eluting stent (the Boston Scientific TAXUS paclitaxel-eluting stent). SYNTAX found the two strategies to be similar for hard endpoints (death and MI). Those receiving PCI required more repeat revascularisation (hence the primary endpoint analysis did not find PCI to be non-inferior), but those undergoing CABG had significantly more strokes pre or perioperatively. Use of the SYNTAX risk score is being investigated as a method of identifying those multivessel disease patients in whom PCI is a reasonable option vs those in whom CABG remains the preferred strategy. * Ischemia, a large trial of 5,179 participants followed for a median of three and a half years that was funded by the US federal government, was skeptical of the benefits of coronary stents.International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches - ISCHEMIA It divided participants into ones which received drug therapy alone, and those that also received bypass surgery or stents. The drug therapy alone group did not fare any differently than the group that received the stents as well as drug therapy. Ischemia did find that stents seemed to help some patients with angina, however.Surgery for Blocked Arteries Is Often Unwarranted, Researchers Find Several other clinical trials have been performed to examine the efficacy of coronary stenting and compare with other treatment options. A consensus of the medical community does not exist. History The first stent was patented in 1972 by Robert A. Ersek, MD based on work he had done in animals in 1969 at the University of Minnesota. In addition to intervascular stents, he also developed the first stent-supported porcine valve that can be implanted transcutaneously in 7 minutes, eliminating open-heart surgery. In development are stents with biocompatible surface coatings which do not elute drugs, and also absorbable stents (metal or polymer).

He was a Senior Editor and Advisory Board member of the Journal of Investment Management, and was a Senior Fellow of the Institute for Quantitative Research in Finance. He served for many years as the editor of the CFA Institute's Financial Analysts Journal. Career Treynor was the prot√©g√© of Franco Modigliani and mentor of Fischer Black. Trained as a mathematics major at Haverford College, he completed Harvard Business School with distinction in 1955 and stayed on for a year afterwards writing cases for Professor Robert Anthony. In 1956, he coauthored a paper on capital equipment leasing. At Harvard, Treynor had been taught that the way to make long-term plant decisions was to discount the 20, 30 or 40 year stream of future benefits back to the present and compare its present value with the initial investment. Importantly, the discount rate should reflect the riskiness of the benefits. Treynor noticed, however, that when the stream of benefits lasted that long, its present value was extremely sensitive to the choice of discount rate; simply by changing the rate, a desirable project could appear undesirable, and vice versa. Treynor resolved to try to understand the relation between risk and the discount rate, and this was the impetus for his most famous \\"idea in the rough\\", the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Treynor began working in the Operations Research department at the consulting firm Arthur D. Little (ADL) in 1956. In 1958, he spent his three weeks of summer vacation in a cottage in Evergreen, Colorado, and generated 44 pages of mathematical notes on the risk problem. From then on, he spent his weekends working on the paper in his ADL office. Treynor's solution to the capital budgeting problem was that the proper discount rate is the one that the capital markets themselves utilize to discount future cash flows. This is the kernel of CAPM. By 1960, Treynor had a draft, which in its 1961 incarnation was titled \\"Market Value, Time, and Risk\\". He gave a copy to John Lintner at Harvard University, the only economist he knew even slightly, but Lintner failed to give Treynor any encouragement. One of Treynor's Chicago- trained ADL colleagues, Stephen Sobotka, sent the draft to Merton Miller. Miller and Modigliani had co-authored their great 1958 and 1963 papers while Modigliani was teaching at Northwestern University. Now Modigliani was moving to MIT, and he called Treynor and invited him to lunch. Modigliani said it was clear from the draft that Treynor needed to come to MIT and study economics, to \\"learn the lingo\\", and Treynor decided to take a one-year sabbatical from ADL to study at MIT. Since the first part of Treynor's draft dealt with the one-period problem, Modigliani suggested breaking the paper into two and naming that part \\"Toward a Theory of the Market Value of Risky Assets\\". Treynor took his advice, and presented the first part to the finance faculty seminar in the fall of 1962 and the second part, titled \\"Implications for the Theory of Finance\\", in the spring of 1963. Later, months after Treynor was back working at ADL, Modigliani called to tell him about William F. Sharpe‚Äôs CAPM paper, and suggested that Treynor and Sharpe exchange drafts. \\"Toward a Theory of the Market Value of Risky Assets\\" was not published until it appeared in 1999 in Robert Korajczyk's book, Asset Pricing and Portfolio Performance. This paper is also presented in the \\"Risk\\" section of Treynor's 2007 book, Treynor on Institutional InvestingJack Treynor (2007). Treynor on Institutional Investing. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. and available on the Social Science Research Network. After Treynor's return to ADL his manager, Martin Ernst, asked him if this work had any practical applications; Treynor suggested several applications and Ernst focused on performance measurement. The result was two Harvard Business Review articles, the first, titled \\"How to Rate Management of Investment Funds\\", on measuring selection, appeared in 1965; the second (with Kay Mazuy), titled \\"Can Mutual Funds Outguess the Market?\\", on measuring timing, followed in 1966. When Fischer Black arrived at ADL in 1965, he took an interest in Treynor's work. After Donald Regan hired Treynor in 1966 to work for him at Merrill Lynch, Black inherited Treynor's ADL case work. Treynor and Black coauthored three published papers, Treynor and Black (1972), Treynor and Black (1973) (both concerned with the Treynor- Black model for portfolio construction) and Treynor and Black (1976); in the latter, Black radically rethought and rewrote Treynor's second MIT presentation from 1963, publishing it, titled \\"Corporate Investment Decisions\\", as chapter 16 in Myers‚Äô 1976 compilation, Modern Developments in Financial Management. Treynor went on to apply his theories for practical purposes in the investment industry. He shared his wealth of knowledge with a younger generation by teaching at several universities. He served a dozen years as the editor of the Financial Analysts Journal, helping authors to present their ideas coherently and with clarity. Many of his papers over the years were published in the FAJ, some as articles and some as editorial commentary. Some of Treynor's writings were originally published under his own name and others under his nom de plume, \\"Walter Bagehot\\". A substantial number of these papers won awards, including the FAJ's Graham and Dodd award and the Roger F. Murray Prize. His ruminations covered a broad swath of the investment universe, including risk, performance measurement, micro- and macroeconomics, trading, accounting, investment value, active management, pensions, and other miscellaneous papers. In 2007, the International Association of Financial Engineers (IAFE) named Treynor as the 2007 IAFE/SunGard Financial Engineer of the Year (FEOY), recognizing him for his preeminent contributions to financial theory and practice, particularly the essence of the capital asset pricing model. He died on May 11, 2016 at the age of 86. See also *Treynor ratio Bibliography *Treynor, Jack L. (1961). \\"Market Value, Time, and Risk\\".

The title features over 20,000 trivia questions covering a variety of topics. Gameplay When setting up a game (using existing Miis if desired), players input their ages, allowing the title to tailor the trivia questions to fit the age of the players. Actual play consists of a variable number of rounds, depending on selected game length. During a round, each player spins a wheel which determines the category for the upcoming set of questions. While spinning and shortly after the wheel stops, players may use the Wii Remote to \\"bump\\" the wheel to attempt to land on the desired category. Categories include \\"Art\\", \\"Books\\", \\"Entertainment\\", \\"Fashion\\", \\"Games\\", \\"Places & People\\", \\"Science\\" and \\"Sports\\". During typical competitive play, players attempt to answer multiple choice questions before others by quickly \\"buzzing in\\". While the question is displayed prior to someone buzzing in, the four available answers are not shown until afterwards, so players may think they know the answer only to be stymied when it is missing as one of the choices. Correct answers reward players with points, while incorrect answers result in a score penalty. Scoring can be set to be either \\"Countdown\\", where points are awarded based on how quickly players answer, or \\"Wager\\", where players battle to decide how many points the upcoming set of questions will be worth in advance. At the end of the game and between certain rounds of longer games, additional bonus rounds are played. During bonus rounds, players take turns answering trivia questions that only one player may answer. Players continue to receive questions until an incorrect answer is given, at which point that player is out of the bonus round. The bonus round continues until all players have given an incorrect answer. Reception The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers were pleased with the actual trivia content but questioned the presentation and value.

Affiliation (ASA) is a Christian religious organization of scientists and people in science-related disciplines. The stated purpose is \\"to investigate any area relating Christian faith and science.\\" The organization publishes a journal, Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith which covers topics related to Christian faith and science from a Christian viewpoint. Members of the organization are from various movements, such as evangelicalism, and represent several Christian traditions including the Lutherans, Catholics, Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists, and the Orthodox. The organization frequently runs seminars at universities in the world, such as Baylor University, the University of Cambridge, and The Catholic University of America.  History  Scientist-Christians who had concerns about the quality of Christian evangelism on the subject of religion and science formed the ASA in 1941. Irwin A. Moon originated the idea of a group; he talked Moody Bible Institute president William H. Houghton into inviting a number of scientists with orthodox Christian views to Chicago to discuss its formation. F. Alton Everest, Peter W. Stoner, Russell D. Sturgis, John P. VanHaitsma, and Irving A. Cowperthwaite attended, and the ASA formed from this meeting. Everest, a conservative Baptist electrical engineer at Oregon State College in Corvallis, served as president of the Affiliation for its first decade. Under his leadership the ASA grew from 5 to 220 members. By 1961 its membership had grown to 860. During the 1940s and 1950s the group provided an evangelical forum for discussing the alleged merits and drawbacks of the theory of evolution, and for evaluating the works of prominent creationists such as George McCready Price (1870-1963) and Harry Rimmer (1890‚Äì1952). The influence of an inner circle affiliated with Wheaton College led it to reject \\"strict\\" creationism in favor first of progressive creationism and then of theistic evolution, encouraging acceptance of evolution among evangelicals.Numbers(2006) pp180-181 This group was led by Russell L. Mixter (later editor of the Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation from 1965 to 1968) and J. Frank Cassel. In the words of Ronald L.

It was formed in 1990, immediately after the Romanian Revolution, although the Romanian Gendarmerie (also re-established in 1990) performed military police duties between 1850 and 1949. Mission 265th Military Police Battalion exercise. The duties of the Military Police are:Romanian Military Police missions according to its official site * Controls the military personnel and documents * Controls and maintains discipline in places/crowded areas frequented by military personnel and eliminates any conflicts between military personnel or military personnel and civilians * Maintains the security during military exercises/parades * Prevents the illegal introduction of devices/materials/substances into the military units/bases * Maintains the safety and discipline at military tribunals * Apprehends deserters in cooperation with the Police, Gendarmerie, Romanian Intelligence Service and other agencies * Prevents, independently or in cooperation with other forces, the stealing of military equipment, ammunition, armament and any other devices from military bases * Maintains, when ordered, the security of the military detainees * May undertake search and rescue/evacuation missions, together with the Romanian Inspectorate for Emergency Situations/Gendarmerie/other Romanian Ministry of Interior forces, of civilian/military persons, in case of earthquakes, floods, or other disasters, and takes measures to limit/eliminate their causes (when possible) and their consequences. History =Beginnings= The history of the Romanian Military Police is close related to the history of the Romanian Gendarmerie, because the provost policing was a task of the Gendarmerie since its inception. It should also be noticed that at first, the Gendarmerie was placed under the command of the Ministry of War. The archaic term of \\"troops' police\\" could be found starting with 1850 in the structure of the armed forces, but the day when the military police was established in its modern form was 5 November 1893. On that day King Carol I promulgated the Law of Rural Gendarmerie. As a part of this corps, the Military Police branch was tasked with the following duties: * to act as judiciary police * to search and arrest AWOLs and disobedient troops * to arrest military personnel without proper documents while on leave * to arrest/annihilate dangerous armed gangs * to repel the attacks against guards * to repel the attempts of prisoners to escape * to search for illegal caches of weapons and ammunition * to inform the population about mobilisation In 1908, 1911 and 1913, new laws and regulations regarding the activity of military police forces were issued in order to increase its efficiency. To avoid any confusions, the new Law of Gendarmerie promulgated on March 24, 1908, mentioned the following: * Art.6: The Gendarmerie corps is a part of the Army. The dispositions of military rules and orders are applicable except some specific situations because of its mixed organisation ‚Äì both civilian and military ‚Äì and specific tasks. * Art.7: The officers will be recruited from the army's personnel. The nominated persons will be assigned to the Gendarmerie troops by King's order, who will issue a High Royal decree. The same law stated that: \\"During military operations the Gendarmerie will act as Military Police in order to manage accurately the military traffic, the escort of prisoners and to assure the security of main objectives and installations\\". In 1913‚Äì1916, some modifications regarding the MP organisation and strength were made and the corps was tasked with new duties, especially related to the security of some important economical areas (oil fields) and factories (mainly those factories who were producing military equipment and machinery). =World War I= During World War I the Military Police corps performed all its specific tasks, including combat missions, and provided assistance to the civilian population. The evolution of the events placed the Gendarmerie alternatively under the command of Ministry of War and Ministry of Interior. In 1917 the Gendarmerie was reassigned to the Ministry of War. Therefore, Gendarmerie detachments were assigned to the General Staff headquarters as well. These detachments were led by infantry officers and their strength consisted of 27 gendarmes. During the interwar period, the Gendarmerie was placed again under Ministry of Interior command, until 12 September 1940. =World War II= In World War II starting on 22 June 1941, as part of Axis troops, the Gendarmerie/military police performed following main activities: * preventing terrorist activities * guarding civilian and military installations * law enforcement * repel the attacks of airborne enemy troops * surveillance of political opponents The Law 264 from 22 April 1943 stipulated that: \\"The Gendarmerie is a military corps. The main mission is to perform the activity of civilian and military police across the country. It is subordinated to Ministry of War but may perform other activities when required by the Minister of Interior\\". On 23 August 1944, the Romanian Government decided to leave the Axis and join the Allies, with the main objective to regain Northern Transylvania and liberate Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Main mission accomplished by MP structures/units were: * to identify enemy troops, disarm and neutralise them * to block/restrict the enemy movements along main supply routes (MSRs) and alternate supply routes (ASRs) * to arrest/annihilate enemy airborne troops * to identify, occupy and guard enemy depots * to arrest or annihilate the enemy troops or partisans behind the front * to find and destroy pro-Nazi or Hungarian propaganda Meanwhile, other Gendarmerie/MP units acted as light infantry, performing specific activities or fighting in close combat. After the war, the military police was disbanded along with the Gendarmerie and its personnel was purged and/or reassigned to other structures. =The communist regime= Starting with 1947, the communist regime established some separate branches as parts of the Ministry of Defense to deal with military police matters. As a result, to this, Law and Discipline, Guide and Control of Military Traffic, Military Justice and Military Jail branches were set up. Each branch was assigned to different departments, breaking the chain of command ‚Äì and making them quite inefficient. Current state Romanian MP training. In 1990, after the Romanian Revolution, the Ministry of National Defence decided to unify all the former MP-type branches into a single structure called \\"Military Police\\". On 12 March 1990, the Minister of National Defence issued an order to establish MP units/subunits all over Romania. Starting on 15 May 1990, the 265 MP Battalion, the 286, 282, 295 and 302 companies were established under the Land Forces' command. The 265th Military Police Battalion (Batalionul 265 Poli≈£ie MilitarƒÉ) is the largest and most important MP unit. It was formed in May 1990 and its headquarters are located in Bucharest. The battalion is often deployed to Iraq on peacekeeping missions. In December 2006, the unit received modernized Humvees that replaced the ARO's still in service. Due to the reorganisation of the Romanian Land Forces, starting with 1999 some MP Companies were transformed into MP platoons and squads and some of them were reassigned to logistic or combat support units. Starting with 2006, four Military Police-Guard Battalions were established. Their main mission is to guard military headquarters and installations. The total strength of these battalions is about 3000 personnel. =International missions= MSU, in Iraq 1990, Saudi Arabia, Desert Storm ‚Äì MPs were Guarding # 100 ROU Field Hospital. 1993‚Äì1995, Somalia UNOSOM- 1 ROU MP Coy 1995‚Äì1999, Angola UNAVEM ‚Äì 1 ROU MP Coy 1997, Albania, AFMP ‚Äì MP personnel acting as part of ROUDET 2001, FYROM* ‚Äì NHQ Skopje MP personnel 2001‚Äì2006, Kosovo ‚Äì 1 ROU MP Platon as part of GRE 34 TCC Coy, acting at Kosovo/FYROM (Djeneral Jankovic- Blace) border, and the Deputy Provost Marshal, KFOR HQ, Film City, Pristina 2000 -2004, Bosnia and Herzegovina A Romanian MP platoon (23 members) was detached to Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 2000, as part of the Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) (until December 2004), as well as part of the EUFOR (since December 2004).

Through Brown's arrangements, the band were able to reproduce sophisticated vocal harmonies in their covers of songs such as \\"Papa Oom Mow Mow\\", \\"The Little Old Lady from Pasadena\\", and \\"Carpet Man\\".Irish Independent, \\"Farewell to a dashing midnight matinee idol\\", 10 June 1999 In a tribute to Brown following his death, Freshmen founder-member, Maurice Henry, described his late friend's pivotal role in the band: > \\"You could say Billy was The Freshmen and without his talent and innovative > musical skills we would certainly not have achieved as much, either as a > showband or in our recordings.The News Letter, \\"Farewell to a star of the > showband scene\\", 8 June 1999 Brown left The Freshmen in the mid 1970s to pursue other musical projects, albeit with limited success. He later rejoined the band and, in 1977, they had one of their biggest hits with his composition, \\"Cinderella\\". Following the breakup of The Freshmen, Brown had a minor solo hit in 1980 with his own song, \\"Look What Jerry Lee Did To Me\\". In his latter years, Brown developed his interest in wildlife, becoming a painter of nature scenes, as well as contributing his insights into the natural world on to RT√â 2fm's children's show, Poporama. Billy Brown died of a heart attack on 6 June 1999, at his home in Johnstown, County Kildare, Republic of Ireland. In its obituary, the Irish Independent referred to him as \\"one of the most gifted musicians of his generation\\".

Although Jones had been known solely as an engraver and painter prior to its publication, the poem won the Hawthornden Prize and the admiration of writers such as W. B. Yeats and T. S. Eliot. Based on Jones's own experience as an infantryman, In Parenthesis narrates the experiences of English Private John Ball in a mixed English-Welsh regiment starting with embarkation from England and ending seven months later with the assault on Mametz Wood during the Battle of the Somme. The work employs a mixture of lyrical verse and prose, is highly allusive, and ranges in tone from formal to Cockney colloquial and military slang. Summary In Part 1, Ball and his battalion assemble, march to Southampton, and sail at night across the English Channel. In Part 2, they receive instruction and training and travel towards the front, where Ball has the shattering experience of a long-range heavy explosive shell exploding nearby. In Part 3 they march at night along a road and then through flooded communication trenches to a position in the front line. As Ball stands sentry, narrative realism gives way to Irish and Welsh mythic associations. Part 4 concerns a typical day in the front line, from morning stand-to to evening stand-down, alternating between fatigue duty, horrendous violence, and boredom. This day is circular in shape, with echoing allusions centring on the great, long boast of Dai Greatcoat. He is the archetypal soldier who has fought in previous historical, legendary, and scriptural conflicts and who never dies. Part 5 is a montage of events in estaminets and work parties in reserve (behind the lines) where rumours abound, culminating in their long march south towards the Somme. In Part 6 they are moved into various positions, and Ball meets and talks with friends. In Part 7 they begin their assault and fight through the day and into the night. Soldiers die whom the reader has come to know. Ball is wounded. In one later passage, the mythic Queen of the Wood visits the dead, bestowing on them garlands according to their worth. Part 7 is the most fragmented, most allusive, most lyrical part of the poem. The work is preceded by the poet's 7-page Preface and followed by his 33 pages of notes. It is accompanied (in some editions) by his frontispiece-drawing of a soldier standing in the waste land and his endpiece-drawing of a spear-pierced scapegoat. Allusions The allusions throughout are literary, historical, and scriptural. The literary allusions include Shakespeare, primarily Henry V, Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Christabel, Lewis Carroll's Alice books, and The Song of Roland but they also include Malory, The Gododdin, The Mabinogion, and the sixth-century Welsh poem Preiddeu Annwn (The Harrowing of Hell). The principal cumulative effect of these allusions is symbolically to align the Battle of the Somme with the catastrophic (for the Welsh) defeats at Catraeth and Camlan. Far from \\"romanticizing\\" war, allusions to romance give to battle frightening archetypal force and express the combatants' preverbal intensity of emotion. Allusions to scripture (especially the Book of Revelation) contribute to this effect. Theme At the centre of the book, Dai Greatcoat says that \\"you\\", the reader, \\"ought to ask\\" questions (like the Grail- questor): \\"Why... what's the meaning of this.\\" It is a question about war but also about life in general‚Äîin his Preface, Jones writes that he did not intend this to be a \\"War Book\\". Life has always involved war (and suffering and dying), so if war has no meaning neither does life. The answer to the question may lie in Malory's Beaumains (alluded to on p. 118), whose true character is disguised by employment as a kitchen boy. However painful the circumstances in life, meaning resides in the virtue (courage, patience, kindness) of human beings, in this case infantrymen. Criticism T. S. Eliot called it \\"a work of genius.\\" W. H. Auden considered it \\"a masterpiece,\\" \\"the greatest book about the First World War\\" that he had read, a work in which Jones did \\"for the British and the Germans what Homer did for the Greeks and the Trojans\\" in \\"a masterpiece\\" comparable in quality to The Divine Comedy. The novelist and poet Adam Thorpe says it \\"towers above any other prose or verse memorial of that war (indeed, of any war)\\". The Jones scholar Thomas Dilworth writes that it is \\"probably the greatest work of British Modernism written between the wars\\" and \\"the greatest work of literature in English on war.\\" The best discussion of In Parenthesis published in Jones's lifetime is by John H. Johnston. Paul Fussell contends that \\"The effect of the poem, for all its horrors, is to rationalize and even to validate the war by implying that it somehow recovers many of the motifs and values of medieval chivalric romance\\". Dilworth, however, argues against Fussell's interpretation, stating the important battles that Jones alludes to - most of them Celtic defeats - are symbolically contained in the archetypal calamities of Camlann and the fall of Troy. Dilworth argues that Jones' allusions to romance literature expresses the horror of modern war and the poignancy of the deaths of infantrymen; and contends that Jones intended to reinterpret the traditional depiction of war by, for example, revealing Shakespeare's Henry V as an incipient anti-war play. Some critics, such as Evelyn Cobley and Umberto Rossi (who carried out a detailed analysis of Part 7), consider In Parenthesis a destructured novel, not a poem.

He in 1941 and William Sears in 1947 independently discovered the Sears‚ÄìHaack body. Life Wolfgang Haack studied mechanical engineering at the Leibniz University Hannover and mathematics in Jena. He earned his doctorate in 1926 at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena. After a short study and research period in Hamburg and a job as an assistant at the Technical University of Stuttgart he habilitated in 1929 at the TH Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk). In 1935 he moved to the TH Berlin and in 1937, he followed the call to the TH Karlsruhe. During the Second World War he worked on projectile design. Although the TH Berlin did invite him to work there in 1944, Wolfgang Haack was unable to take up the post because of the war. In 1949 he became the successor to Georg Hamel as Professor of Mathematics and Mechanics at the TU Berlin Department of Mathematics and Mechanics. On his initiative a new Department of Computational Mathematics was founded in 1964, which he held until his retirement in 1968. In 1992 Haack was appointed as an honorary member of the Society for Applied Mathematics and Mechanics. In 1964 Haack was called to the new chair for numerical mathematics, a position he was to hold until being given emeritus status in 1968. Applied mathematics The interaction of Wolfgang Haack is at the interface between mathematics and mechanics. His research areas ranging from the mechanics of differential geometry and partial differential equations to numerical mathematics. In particular, he dealt with both elliptical and with hyperbolic partial differential equations of the first order. Coming from differential geometry, Pfaff's differential forms were always of special concern to him. As an engineer, he was always focussed on applied research, such as gas dynamics in supersonic flows. During his time in Berlin, he supervised over a dozen dissertations. Haack minimum drag shapes Sears-Haack body During World War II, Haack was involved in Nazi military research. His work on an analytical formula for projectile nose cone shapes that exhibit the lowest air resistance depending on caliber or diameter and length or volume and length of the profile was published in 1941 by the Lilienthal society but was kept secret during World War II. Haack shapes or Sears‚ÄìHaack bodies are not ogives or constructed from any other geometric figures. The shapes are instead mathematically derived streamlined bodies of revolution for the purpose of minimizing drag. Minimal projectile-shape variations can change the air- resistance and hence the effective range of high powered gun projectiles considerably, especially when they change velocity from the supersonic to the transonic and eventually to subsonic air flow regimes or vice versa during flight. For this kind of applications the Haack shape offers significantly improved characteristics compared to the tangent ogive or even the secant ogive often used for very-low-drag bullets and artillery shells.Haack Minimum Drag Rifle Bullet Only after the end of World War II have Haack shaped projectiles for artillery guns and sniper rifles been produced.LM Class Bullets, very high BC bullets for windy long Ranges Besides that Haack shapes are also applied in modern fast flying aircraft. Fighter aircraft are probably good examples of nose shapes optimized for the transonic region, although their nose shapes are often distorted by other considerations of avionics and inlets. For example, an F-16 nose appears to be a very close match to a Haack shape. Pioneer of numerical mathematics Haack recognized early on the potential of computers for scientific and industrial research. As early as 1950 he established a working group on electronic calculating machines. He contacted Konrad Zuse with the aim that an electronic calculator would be acquired for the Technische Universit√§t Berlin. The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft assumed that the existing computing machines at Darmstadt, G√∂ttingen and Munich were sufficient for the time being. It was due to his solicitation of donations from the private industry that in 1958 the first computer at the TU Berlin was set up.

Background The critic Douglas Wolk described the song as \\"a truly shameless ripoff of The Isley Brothers' 1959 hit \\"Shout\\"... basically the fast parts of \\"Shout\\" with the gospel inflections removed and the word 'shimmy' added.\\"Wolk, Douglas. (2004). Live at the Apollo, 30-31. New York: Continuum Books. Wolk argues that Brown and The Famous Flames probably performed \\"Shout and Shimmy\\" in the October 24, 1962 concerts at which Live at the Apollo was recorded, but that it was left off of the album to prevent sales competition with the studio version of the song. Evidence to support this contention includes the fact that Brown customarily began his concerts with his latest hit (which \\"Shout and Shimmy\\" was at the time), and the presence of \\"Shout and Shimmy\\"'s a cappella opening (\\"You know I feel all right...\\") immediately before the first song on the album, \\"I'll Go Crazy\\". James and The Famous Flames sang and performed this song on Dick Clark's American Bandstand,on a telecast dated June 11th, 1962. A performance of \\"Shout and Shimmy\\" was the first track on Brown & The Flames' next live album, 1964's Pure Dynamite! Live at the Royal, featuring a comedy skit between Brown and Famous Flame Bobby Bennett. The Who version In two days during 12 to 14 April, 1965, British rock group the Who recorded \\"Shout and Shimmy\\" as the B-side to their fourth single (third single under the name 'the Who') \\"My Generation\\", which was released on October 29, 1965. The A-side reached number 2 in the United Kingdom, but only reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 99 in Cashbox magazine. The song was part of the Who's repertoire from late 1964, along with several other rhythm and blues covers, including other songs by James Brown. It was ultimately dropped in 1966 once the group had written enough original material. Several other songs was recorded during the same session as \\"Shout and Shimmy\\", including \\"I'm a Man\\", \\"Leaving Here\\", \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\" along two other songs written by Brown: \\"Please, Please, Please\\" and \\"I Don't Mind\\". Their version is undisputedly greatly derived from \\"Shout\\", a song by the Isley Brothers made famous by Lulu and the Luvvers, including call- and-response lyrics throughout, similar to other songs by the group at the time, including \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\". In the US however, \\"Shout and Shimmy\\" was not released as the B-side of \\"My Generation\\", and was instead substituted by \\"Out in the Street\\", which later appeared on their debut album My Generation.

His lectures and bedside teaching methods won much appreciation among the students. It was in 1997, that he started private practice in a small consultation room at his house in Mudavanmugal. Jothydev had his training in Geriatrics under the guidance of Dr. Dharmarajan at Our Lady of Mercy Hospital, New York. His special interest in Geriatrics encouraged him to organize and participate in programs for the geriatric population. He is currently the Vice-President of Geriatric Society of India. While working in Medical College, he was selected for establishing a diabetes centre in Trivandrum in association with the world famous Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, USA. He joined Mayo Clinic in 2002; while he kept in touch with his patients back in India, via DTMS. Jothydev returned to India (2003) after the Endocrinology Fellowship training programme. However, the international partnership venture to set up the proposed institute with him as the Director did not materialize and he resumed private practice at his residence. Years later, a handful of his friends, well-wishers and patients urged him to set up a centre, dedicated for the treatment of diabetes. Academic and philanthropic endeavours  He started his career as a teacher in Medical College, Trivandrum. Even after leaving his alma mater, he continues to teach medical students and practicing doctors in local, national and international gatherings. Jothydev has delivered lectures at more than 200 diabetes conventions within India and in over 20 countries across the globe. He has been a regular speaker at several national conferences like RSSDI, DiabetesIndia, APICON,CID etc. His original research and publications in peer reviewed journals on insulin pump therapy, cost effective use of telemedicine in diabetes, Continuous Glucose Monitoring, Incretin based therapies etc. are well accepted among the medical fraternity. He was the only speaker from the state of Kerala to lecture at conferences like, International Diabetes Federation (IDF) (2009-invited speaker, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017 - invited speaker), Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) (2017, 2018 - invited speaker) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) (2009, 2011). He has more than 20 original research abstracts at the ADA. Having organized several local and national conferences for propagating the recent advances in the field of diabetes, he is considered one of the few Diabetologists who translates research into clinical practice and conducts several landmark multicentric multinational clinical trials. His pioneering original research and publications in peer reviewed journals on insulin pump therapy, cost effective use of telemedicine in diabetes, continuous glucose monitoring, Incretin based therapies etc. are well accepted by the medical fraternity and serves as benchmark for further research in diabetes.  Jothydev's Diabetes Research Center(JDC) Jothydev's Diabetes Research Centre (JDC) started working on 7 April 2006. The Centre is a comprehensive ISO certified diabetes care centre located at Mudavanmugal, Poojapura, Trivandrum, Kerala, India. This is also the International Diabetes Federation recognised centre in Kerala for both excellence in diabetes care and education. The centre offers state of the art treatment for diabetes and related illnesses. With the constant support of its well-wishers and patients, the foundation stone for the second phase of the centre was laid by Padmasree Mohanlal on 10 May 2008. In an effort to reach out to more patients, a subsidiary of JDC, Jothydev's Diabetes Centre & Hospitals at Kochi was initiated in 2011 and at Attingal in 2018. Jothydev was the pioneer in introducing the telemedicine concept of patient follow-up via Diabetes Tele Management System in 1998. DTMS precludes the necessity for physical visits to the hospital, but the virtual visits via telephone or internet or email helps the patients modify their medication dosages, diet and exercise as per the advice of the diabetes team. Well trained multi-disciplinary professional team at JDC, currently follows up more than ten thousand patients via DTMS with regular titration of medications, diet and lifestyle. This cost effective model has been proven to reduce A1c to below 7% without the risks of hypoglycaemia. The evidence and science of this innovation were presented in global scientific conventions and also published in medical journals.

P.Kesavadev Trust and Jothydev's Diabetes Research Centre have been organizing World Diabetes Day (WDD) events since 2000. The events used to take place in important venues in Kerala and at times at faraway locations. Walks, Television programs, Radio talks, Quiz programs, Huge processions, Exhibitions, Free camps and interactive awareness lectures, etc. are part of the events. The World Diabetes Month events organised by the team have gained huge acceptance throughout the years. The Diabetes Kerala 2012 and 2013 massive awareness campaigns on diabetes first time ever in the history of Kerala was organized with support from International Diabetes Federation (IDF). The innovative diabetes month campaigns in 2014 aimed at spreading the message of healthy breakfast attracted diabetes patients and generate public across the globe. = Diabscreen Kerala = Jothydev is the Chairman of Diabscreen Kerala, a massive diabetes awareness project of Kesavadev Trust, formed in memory of his father, Late.

Castells believes that \\"The openness of the Internet's architecture was the source of its main strength\\".Castells 2001, p.27 Then he states that the 'Internet Culture' is structured by four kinds of culture including: 'the techno-meritocratic culture', 'the hacker culture', 'the virtual communication culture', and 'the entrepreneurial culture'.Castells 2001, p.37 Next, Castells analyses the vital status of Internet in the business and economy fields, and he refers to the impact of virtual communication which is based on the Internet communication to the reality in the following chapter. In terms of the Politics of the Internet, Castells points that 'social movement' and 'the political process' use Internet as a new communication medium to 'acting' and 'informing'. And there is an issue between 'Privacy and Liberty in Cyberspace' relates to 'the politics of the Internet' is mentioned in this book. In the last three chapters, Castells analyses the Internet from multimedia, geography and 'the digital divide in a global perspective'. Finally, he talks about the challenges of the network society such as freedom of the Internet. Opening: The Network is the Message The title used for the preface or introductory text is called \\"Opening\\" and the name given to this Opening is \\"The Network is the Message\\". It is a mimicry of Marshall McLuhan's famous slogan \\"The medium is the message\\". By substituting network for medium, Castells reinforces McLuhan's message that, in this case, it is the network which is important not the content.In this sense the network is just like the lightbulb. See the Heritage Minute on McLuhan. The opening may then be seen to be an invitation to explore the meaning of network via the content of the book. The word network itself is of ambiguous interpretation: infrastructure or society?See Martin Weller's account on the subject. Both interpretations are at play in the book. Since Castells is by profession a sociologist, then one expects a focus on network as society. Lessons from the History of the Internet Castells introduces the label ‚Ä≥Libertarian‚Ä≥ to characterize all those who participated with \\"big science\\" and \\"military research\\" in bringing the Internet into being.Castells 2001, p17 The history of the Internet is diverse and well documented. Castells makes considerable use of John Naughton's text, \\"A Brief History of the Future\\", who noted for example that the Request for Comment Feature (RFC), introduced by Steve Crocker in 1969-04-07,This can be retrieved by typing 0001 into the box on the IETF RFC page. not only gave rise to a de facto documenting of the research ideas at the time of their fermenting but also to the Open Source movement.Naughton 2000, p135-38. Castells gives his own take on the subject. Ultimately, for him, the Internet is a cultural creation. The Culture of the Internet > \\"The culture of the Internet is a culture made up of a technocratic belief > in the progress of humans through technology, enacted by communities of > hackers thriving on free and open technological creativity, embedded in > virtual networks aimed at reinventing society, and materialized by money- > driven entrepreneurs into the workings of the new economy.\\"Castells 2001, > p61. It is important to note that Castells uses the term hacker in a very > old and revered sense. It is important to take note of how Castells understands and uses the word Network. For him, the network is a word that often has connotations of community. So, when he speaks of virtual networks he is not (necessarily) speaking of virtual networks in the technological sense but in the community sense of people networking. e-Business and the New Economy > \\"But markets also react to macro-economic conditions, and to policy > decisions‚Äîor to their anticipation. Or to the disparity between the > anticipation and the actual event. Markets react as well on the basis of > non-economic criteria. These are influenced by what I call > informationTurbulences from various sources, such as political > uncertainty... technological anticipations... or even personal moods or > statements from key decision-makers...\\"Castells 2001, p86. In the text > (2001), Castells names Greenspan and Duisenberg as key decision-makers. For > technological anticipations, he suggested the demise of the PC or the rise > of the mobile internet. And the ellipsis in the quote covers the anti-trust > law suit against Microsoft, at the time. Virtual Communities or Network Society? > \\"In contrast with the notorious cartoon published by The New Yorker in the > pre-history of on-line communication, on the Internet you better make sure > that everyone knows that you are a dog, and not a cat, or you will find > yourself immersed in the intimate world of cats.

The Politics of the Internet I: Computer Networks, Civil Society, and the State > \\"In this context [of a world dominated by homogeneous, global information > flows], communication of values, mobilization around meaning, become > fundamental.

Each e-Link is given as a URL, followed by a short text of one or two lines to describe the content. For example, at the end of Chapter 6 \\"The Politics of the Internet II: Privacy and Liberty in Cyberspace\\", a collection of 4 e-Links is given: * cnetdownload.com * junkbusters.com * silentsurf.com * anonymizer.com and the short explanatory text following is \\"Websites providing technological resources to protect privacy.\\" There is one major flaw associated with the e-Links.

Biography John Joseph (‚ÄúJack‚Äù) Caddigan was born to Michael Caddigan (sometimes spelled Cadigan) and the former Johanna Carroll. Michael was a plumber who had emigrated from Ireland; Johanna was of Irish parentage but had been born in New Brunswick, Canada.Massachusetts Birth Records; World War I Draft Registration Cards; U. S. Federal Census, 1900. Jack was one of seven children; the family lived in Boston‚Äôs crowded South End, the immigrant community from which many entertainment figures hailed. Jack initially apprenticed himself as a plumber, but in 1904 he joined the Boston Edison Company, rising through the ranks to become Assistant Vice-President in charge of advertising at his retirement in 1949.U. S. Federal Census, 1900; \\"Deaths and Funerals,\\" Boston Daily Globe, January 2, 1952, p. 15. He married Mary E. Manning on January 30, 1907, and the couple raised seven children.Massachusetts Marriage Records; U. S. Federal Census, 1930, 1940. He lived all his life in the Boston area, first in the city proper and later in the southwest suburb of Canton. Lyricist Over half of Caddigan's songs were written between 1914 and 1918, and it follows that a large number are related to the war. \\"The Rose of No Man's Land\\" was probably his most popular number; other wartime successes included \\"Salvation Lassie of Mine\\" and \\"We're All Going Calling on the Kaiser.\\" He was equally capable with upbeat novelties and sentimental waltzes; his lyrics are down-to-earth, bluntly rhymed, and with lilting metric energy. James A. Brennan and Chick Story wrote the music for over three-quarters of his songs; another noteworthy collaborator was the young Jimmy McHugh. The great majority of Caddigan‚Äôs songs were issued by Boston publishers, though a few late songs were published by Tin Pan Alley firms like Leo Feist. Caddigan remained interested in entertainment after he ceased writing lyrics, directing amateur minstrel shows and revues for civic and corporate groups in his later years.\\"Deaths and Funerals,\\" Boston Daily Globe, January 2, 1952, p. 15.

Of north African origin, he was active during the long reigns of the emperors Hadrian (r. 117‚Äì138), Antoninus Pius (r. 138‚Äì161), and Marcus Aurelius (r. 161‚Äì180), as well as the shorter reign of Marcus Aurelius' first co-Emperor, Lucius Verus (r. 161-169). In the Roman government, Julianus gradually rose in rank through a traditional series of offices. He was successively quaestor to the Emperor Hadrian (with double the usual salary), tribune of the plebs, praetor, praefectus aerarii Saturni, and praefectus aerarii militaris, before assuming the high annual office of Roman consul in 148.H. F. Jolowicz and Barry Nicholas, Historical Introduction to the Study of Roman Law (Cambridge University 1932 by Jolowicz; 3d ed. 1972 by Nicholas) at 384‚Äì385. Julianus also served in the emperor's inner circle, the consilium principis, which functioned something like a modern cabinet, directing new legislation, but also sometimes like a court of law. \\"Hadrian organized it as a permanent council composed of members (jurists, high imperial functionaries of equestrian rank, and senators) appointed for life (consiliarii).\\"Adolph Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society 1953), \\"Consilium principis\\" at 408. In the 4th-century Historia Augusta,The Historia Augusta purports to be a 3rd-century collection of biographies on Roman emperors written by six different authors. Scholarly consensus now accepts Hermann Dessau's 1889 theory that it is a late 4th-century work by one author. Anthony Birley, \\"Introduction\\" 7‚Äì22, at 7‚Äì8, to the Lives of the later Caesars (Penguin 1976), a partial translation of the Historia August. Thus it was probably the fictitious \\"Aelius Spartianus\\" who purportedly wrote, e.g., the Vita Hadriani (at 57‚Äì87), and other biographies contained therein. the Emperor Hadrian's consilium principis included Julianus. Though Julianus for decades served several emperors in succession, at high levels of the Roman imperial government, to investigate the details of his jurisprudence his written works on law are the primary sources. \\"The task of his life consisted, in the first place, in the final consolidation of the edictal law; and, secondly, in the composition of his great Digest in ninety books.\\"Rudolph Sohm, Institutionen. Ein Lehrbuch der Geschichte und System des r√∂mischen Privatrechts (Leipzig: Duncker und Humblot 1883, 12th ed. 1905), translated as The Institutes. A textbook of the History and System of Roman Private Law (London: Oxford University, Clarendon Press, 3d ed. 1907; reprint: Augustus Kelly 1970) at 97‚Äì98. Life and career Julianus was born during the last years of the Emperor Trajan (r. 98‚Äì117), probably at the village of Pupput near the Roman colony of Hadrumetum, on the east coast of Africa Province (now modern Sousse in Tunisia). Apparently he came from a Latin-speaking family. At Hadrumetum, an inscription has been discovered which describes his career in office.H. F. Jolowicz and Barry Nicholas, Historical Introduction to the Study of Roman Law (Cambridge University 1932 by Jolowicz; 3d ed. 1972 by Nicholas) at 384 text and note 4.Diana Bowder, editor, Who Was Who in the Roman World (Ithaca: Cornell University 1980) at 119. He studied law with Javolenus Priscus, the head of the Sabinian school of legal thought. Julianus refers to Javolenus in his mature legal writings.Julianus, his Digesta, at book 42; i.e., Iulianus, liber xlii, digestorum.Centuries later this short text concerning manumissions was quoted in the Digest (or Pandectae) of Justinian (r.527‚Äì565); in it Iulianus refers to Javolenus as \\"praeceptorem meum\\" [my teacher].Digesta Iustiniani (Byzantium 533), edited by Theodor Mommsen (1818-1903), translated by Alan Watson as The Digest of Justinian (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania 1985), volume II: at 40.2.5 (book, chapter, source), \\"For my part, since I remember that my teacher, Javolenus, had manumitted... .\\" Even as a young man he was renowned for his learning. According to his contemporary the Roman jurist Sextus Pomponius, Julianus (along with Aburnus Valens and Tuscianus) eventually came to lead for a time this very influential school of jurisprudence. A student of Julianus, namely Sextus Caecilius Africanus, perhaps later followed as the head of this Sabinian school.Adolph Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society 1953), \\"Iulianus\\" at 522.Yet Prof. Buckland writes, \\"The last recorded chief of the Sabinians, [Iulianus] was too strong to be bound by the traditions of any school.\\" W. W. Buckland, A Text-Book of Roman Law from Augustus to Justinian (Cambridge University 1923, 3d ed. revised by Peter Stein, 1966) at 29. During the Principate the classical Roman law flourished.Fritz Schulz, History of Roman Legal Science (Oxford University 1946, 1967) at 99, 126. Roman law's classical period is said to begin with Augustus (r.31 BC‚ÄìAD 14) and end as Diocletian (r.284‚Äì305) was starting the next bureaucratic period. Two schools of legal thought contended: the Proculian (earlier linked to Labeo) and the Sabinian. It appears there was some rivalry between Julianus, who led the Sabinian, and another Roman jurist, a contemporary named Publius Iuventius Celsus, who led the Proculian. Neither one quoted the other in his writings, apparently.H. F. Jolowicz and Barry Nicholas, Historical Introduction to the Study of Roman Law (Cambridge University 1932 by Jolowicz; 3d ed. 1972 by Nicholas) at 385. Among long- standing, close colleagues of Julianus were the aforementioned jurists Africanus and Pomponius.Rudolph Sohm, The Institutes. History and system of Roman private law (Leipzig 1883; Oxford Univ. 3d ed. 1907; reprint 1970) at 98.Of the opinions of Iulianus, many were published with commentary by his student Africanus. Adolph Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society 1953), \\"Africanus\\" at 356. During this period Hadrian (r.117‚Äì138) also appointed Julianus to revise into final form the Praetor's Edict, which up until then had been announced annually. Thereafter, Iulianus became occupied with writing his own substantial commentary on developments in Roman law, his celebrated Digestorum libri xc [Digesta in 90 books].Fritz Schulz, History of Roman Legal Science (Oxford University 1946, 1967) at 105 (offices held); 127, 148‚Äì152 (Edicta praetorum); 130‚Äì132, 229‚Äì30 (Digestorum libri xc). Under the next emperor, Antoninus Pius, Julianus continued serving in the imperial council, the consilium principis.Cf., Julius Capitolinus, \\"Antoninus Pius\\", 96-107, at 106, in the Historia Augusta translated by Anthony Birley as Lives of the later Caesars (Penguin 1976). Subsequently he became governor of Germania Inferior under Antonius Pius, and later governor of Hispania Tarraconensis under the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Julianus then returned to his native region where, c. 168-169, he concluded his career as proconsul of Africa Province. He seems to have died during the co-reign of Lucius Verus (r.161-169).W. W. Buckland, A Text-Book of Roman Law (Cambridge University 1923, 3d ed. revised by Peter Stein, 1966) at 29. Little is known of his private life. Yet Julianus (whose own date of birth is uncertain) evidently was related to the emperor Didius Iulianus (133‚Äì193, r.193). Perhaps through his daughter from Hadrumetum, who married into \\"one of the most prominent families of Mediolanum\\" (modern Milan), he became the grandfather of Didius Iulianus, or else his uncle.Cf., Aelius Spartianus, \\"Didius Iulianus\\" in the Historia Augusta, translated as Lives of the later Caesars (Penguin 1976), 192‚Äì200, at 192 (\\"his maternal grandfather [was] from the colony of Hadrumetum [Sousse]\\").Cf., Michael Grant, The Roman Emperors (New York: Scribner's 1985; reprint Barnes & Noble 1997), \\"Didius\\" at 105 (\\"his mother, a North African, was a close relative of Salvius Iulianus, the outstanding lawyer of Hadrian's reign\\").Compare: H. F. Jolowicz and Barry Nicholas, Historical Introduction to the Study of Roman Law (Cambridge University 1932 by Jolowicz; 3d ed. 1972 by Nicholas) at 384 note 4. Here: \\"great grandfather\\", \\"grandfather\\", or \\"uncle\\". Yet Didius was unfortunately a notorious scoundrel, who nonetheless was evidently raised by the mother of the noble Emperor Marcus Aurelius (r.161‚Äì180).Michael Grant, The Roman Emperors (New York: Scribner's 1985; reprint Barnes & Noble 1997), \\"Didius Julianus\\" at 105‚Äì08. Legal works Senatus Populusque Romanus. =The Praetor's Edict= Soon after 125, the emperor Hadrian appointed Julianus to collect and revise all the edicta praetorum or Praetors' Edicts available. For centuries each incoming praetor urbanus had issued these annual edicts, which announced his legal positions for the next year. \\"The contents of the praetorian Edict can be summed up as constituting the praetor's programme of office: he is announcing to the public, at the beginning of his term, how he intends to exercise his office.\\"Fritz Schulz, History of Roman Legal Science (Oxford University 1946, 1967) at 150. For centuries, until the end of the Republic (to 44 BC), this document had been a most influential and pervasive legal authority in Roman law.Alan Watson, Law Making in the latter Roman Republic (Oxford University 1974), chapter 3, \\"Development of the Praetor's Edict\\", 31‚Äì62, e.g., at 35 (summarising the Edict from the 3rd century to 100 BC when follows the \\"main period of the Edict\\"). By the 2nd century, however, the Praetor's Edict merely might adopt novel procedures to enforce new legislation made elsewhere, e.g., by imperial enactment. In a senatus consultum, Hadrian directed that the revision by Iulianus thereafter be made perpetual.W. W. Buckland, Text-book on Roman Law.

Professor Michael Grant writes that his revision proved to be of some use to the poor.Michael Grant, The Roman Emperors (New York: Scribner's 1985; reprint Barnes & Noble 1997), at 79-80. Another scholar writes, \\"The Edict, that masterpiece of republican jurisprudence, became stabilized. ... By order of [Hadrian] the famous jurist Julian settled the final form of the praetorian and aedilician Edicts.\\"Fritz Schulz, History of Roman Legal Science (Oxford University 1946, 1967) at 127. \\"The edictal system is so important in the history of juristic systematization... .\\" Schulz (1946, 1967) at 148. Yet our sources for this major reform are \\"meagre and late\\", so that it \\"is difficult to tell what Julianus in fact did.\\"H. F. Jolowicz and Barry Nicholas, Historical Introduction to the Study of Roman Law (Cambridge University 1932 by Jolowicz; 3d ed. 1972 by Nicholas) at 356‚Äì57. A key feature of the Praetor's Edict was its organisational scheme, the order in which the various subjects of the law are presented. This sequence had obviously \\"grown up gradually from one generation to another. How far Julian's final redaction departs from the hitherto traditional arrangement we have not the means of judging save in some exceptional cases.\\" Nonetheless, certain changes in the Edict wrought by Julianus are well known, e.g., regarding intestate succession, that affecting shares of inheritance among children in the Bonorum possessio unde liberi.Called the nova clausula Juliani de conjungendis, &c.; Rudolph Sohm, Institutionen (Leipzig 1883), translated as The Institutes. History and system of Roman private law (Oxford University 1907; reprint Kelly 1970), at 531‚Äì532 text and at note 3. Moreover, his other alterations do not seem problematic. It was this received \\"edictal order of topics\\" that was already widely used in juristic works of the Principate, during the classical period of Roman Law.Fritz Schulz, History of Roman Legal Science (Oxford University 1946, 1967): Edicta, Edictum perpetuum at 126‚Äì127, 152 (quote); classical juristic works at 189‚Äì190. Among Roman jurists, \\"Julian's work on the Edict was traditionally regarded as of great importance [as] he is repeatedly spoken of as compositor, conditor, ordinator of the Edict.\\"W. W. Buckland, A Text-Book of Roman Law (Cambridge University 1923; 3d ed. revised by Peter Stein, 1966) at 10. =His Digesta in 90 books= Of his own writings, his principal work was the Digesta, a systematic treatise on civil and praetorian law which was often cited by Roman legal writers. ‚ÄúIt is a comprehensive collection of responsa on real and hypothetical cases; in general, it followed the edictal system.‚Äù The works of Iulianus, in particular his Digesta, \\"are among the most highly appreciated products of Roman juristic literature.\\" Prof. Schulz, however, notes the reluctance of classical Roman jurists to formulate principles.\\"'All abstract formulations in private law are dangerous; they generally prove fallacious': this saying of Iavolenus [teacher of Julianus in Digest 50.17.202] is more than a casual remark; it voices the intimate conviction of the second century jurist.\\" In a later age, Justinian's compilers \\"cherished\\" and searched for reductions of \\"case law\\" to \\"abstract principles\\", precisely what \\"the classical jurists purposely refrained from doing\\". Fritz Schulz, History of Roman Legal Science (Oxford University 1946, 1967) at 130. \\"Even in the more theoretical works, such as Julian's... Digesta, case law is dominant, and no attempt is made to translate the cases into abstract principles.\\" This literature, however, does employ \\"casuistical form\\" rather than \\"simply strung together\\" responsa. > \\"[P]roblems are considered from the point of view of general theory, with > the result that imagined cases play a considerable, perhaps even a > predominant, part. But even so, a plain statement of the theoretical result > of the cases, a formulation of the principle to be deduced from them, is > avoided.\\"Fritz Schulz, History of Roman Legal Science (Oxford University > 1946, 1967) at 130‚Äì131. Other scholars remark on the ascendancy that his writings earned Julianus. According to Prof. Buckland, his presence worked to transcend the opposing schools or sects of Roman law which had continued for several centuries.W. W. Buckland, A Text-Book of Roman Law (Cambridge University 1923; 3d ed. as revised by Peter Stein, 1966) at 26 (sects or schools), at 29 (Digesta of Julianus). Prof. Sohm states: > \\"His vast acquaintance with practical case-law, the ingenuity of his own > countless decisions, his genius for bringing out, in each separate case, the > general rule of law which, tersely and pithily put, strikes the mind with > all the force of a brilliant aphorism and sheds its light over the whole > subject aroundthese are the features which constitute the power of his > work.

The purpose of his Digesta was to expound the whole of Roman law. \\"It contains a collection of responsa of the most varied kinds: answers by letter, answers in disputations (to be inferred when the answer is introduced by dixi), true responsa in the technical sense, and answers to questions which occurred to the author in the course of theoretical speculation.\\"Fritz Schulz, History of Roman Legal Science (Oxford University 1946, 1967) at 229‚Äì30: the Digestorum libri xc of Julian. =Other works= It is known that \\"Julianus also wrote commentaries on works of two earlier, [now] little known jurists, Urseius Felix [Urseius, 4 books] and Minicius [Minicius, 6 books], and a booklet De ambiguitatibus [On doubtful questions].\\"The Digest of Justinian translated by Alan Watson (University of Pennsylvania 1985) at vol.

These quotations are translated here by Alan Watson as The Digest of Justinian, published by the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia 1985), two volumes. Traditional Digest citation (book, chapter, source) follows the quotation. *libri 7 digestorum: \\"If the seller has misrepresented the condition of a farm but not its measurements, he is still liable to the buyer; for example, suppose he said there were fifty jugera of vineyard and fifty of meadow, and the meadow is found to be larger but there are one hundred jugera in all.\\" 19.1.22 *libri 13 digestorum: \\"When we indeed agree on the thing delivered but differ over the grounds of delivery, I see no reason why the delivery should not be effective. ... Again, if I give you coined money as a gift and you receive it as a loan, it is settled law that the fact that we disagree on the grounds of delivery and acceptance is no barrier to the transfer of ownership to you.\\" 41.1.36 *libri 15 digestorum: \\"It is not possible for every point to be specifically dealt with either in statutes or in senatus consulta; but whenever in any case their sense is clear, the president of the tribunal ought to proceed by analogical reasoning and declare the law accordingly.\\" 1.3.12 *libri 27 digestorum: \\"We cannot follow a rule of law in instances where there has been a decision against the ratio juris. 1.3.15 [Here, the latin text at the top of the article: In his, quae contra rationem iuris constituta sunt, non possumus sequi regulam iuris.] *libri 54 digestorum: \\"The nature of a cavil, which the Greeks call sorites, is this, that the argument leads by short steps from what is evidently true to what is evidently false.\\" 50.17.65 *libri 59 digestorum: \\"[A] person conceived after his grandfather's death can neither take the estate on the latter's intestacy as suus heres nor receive bonorum possessio as cognate relative, because the Law of the Twelve Tables calls to the inheritance a person who has been alive at the time of the death of the man whose property is in question.\\" 38.16.6 *libri 84 digestorum: \\"Age-encrusted custom is not undeservedly cherished as having almost statutory force, and this is the kind of law which is said to be established by use and wont. For given that statutes themselves are binding upon us for no other reason than that they have been accepted by the judgment of the populace, certainly it is fitting that what the populace has accepted without any writing shall be binding upon everyone. What does it matter whether the people declares its will by voting or by the very substance of its actions? Accordingly, it is absolutely right to accept the point that statutes may be repealed not only by vote of the legislature but also by the silent agreement of everyone expressed through desuetude.\\" 1.3.32:1 *libri 88 digestorum: \\"Whenever anyone stipulates for oil under a time clause or other condition, its value ought to be assessed when the obligation vests; for from that moment it can be sued for. If it is otherwise, the loss is the debtor's.\\" 45.1.59 *libri 6 minicius: \\"If it is agreed that a landlord should not bring an action against a tenant and there was a lawful ground for the agreement, the tenant nevertheless can bring an action against the landlord.\\" 2.14.56 *libri 3 urseius ferax: \\"A man agreed to buy land from one who had mortgaged it to a third party, provided that the vendor discharged the encumbrance before the first of July. The question was whether the purchaser could effectively bring the action on purchase to require the vendor to redeem the land. The reply was: Let us consider what was agreed between the parties. If their agreement was that come what may, the vendor should redeem the land before the first of July, the action on purchase will lie for its redemption and the sale will not be regarded as conditional, as though the purchaser said, 'I will buy the land, if you redeem it by the first of July' or 'provided that you redeem it in that time from Titius.' But if the purchase were made under condition, there will be no action to get the condition realized.\\" 18.1.41 Influence and legacy =Among Roman jurists= His opinions influenced many other jurists, thanks to the clarity and finesse of his reasoning, as is demonstrated by the fact that, in the Digest, there are 457 fragments written by Iulianus. His name also appears first in the list of contributing jurisprudents prepared by order of Justinian, the Index Florentinus. Centuries after his death, Emperor Justinianus would refer to him as legum et edicti perpetui suptilissimus conditor.Constitutio Tanta 18. The Tanta was Justinian's enactment text of December 16, 533, which promulgated the Digest. Adolph Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society 1953), \\"Digesta Iustiniani\\" at 436-437, \\"Tanta\\" at 730, \\"Dedoken\\" at 427. The 2nd-century Digesta of Salvius Iulianus was repeatedly excerpted, hundreds of times, by the compilers of the 6th-century Pandectae (or Digest), created under the authority of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565). This imperial Pandect or Digest (part of the Corpus Juris Civilis) was meant by the emperor to serve as a compendium of juristic experience and learning, being drawn from the works of prior Roman jurists. \\"It has been thought that Justinian's compilers used [Julian's Digest] as the basis of their scheme: in any case nearly 500 passages are quoted from it.\\"W. W. Buckland, Text-book on Roman Law (Cambridge University 1921, 3rd ed. 1963 rev. by P. Stein), at 29. Yet in Justinian's 6th-century Digest many more passages are quoted from other Roman jurists, and Iulianus \\"is not one of the five singled out for citation in the Law of Citations ...no doubt due to his early date.\\" Buckland (1963) at 29.The Pandect, in addition to its official r√¥le as part of the controlling law of the eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, also became a principal source for the medieval study of Roman Law in western Europe. Peter Stein, Roman Law in European History (Cambridge University 1999) at 43‚Äì45. Stein quotes from a letter of the famous, 19th-century English legal historian F. W. Maitland: > \\"The Digest [of Justinian] was the only book in which medieval students > could obtain a knowledge of Roman law at its best. ...but for the Digest > Roman law could never have reconquered the world. ...it was only in the > Digest that [lawyers] could get any notion of keen and exact legal argument, > precise definition etc.\\" Stein (1999) at 44. Julian died during the reign of the philosophical emperor Marcus Aurelius (r.161-180), who described him in a rescript as amicus noster.The Latin amicus noster signifies \\"our friend\\". \\"His fame did not lessen as time went on, for later Emperors speak of him in the most laudatory terms. ... Justinian speaks of him as the most illustrious of the jurists.\\"W. W. Buckland, Text-book on Roman Law. (Cambridge University 1921, 3rd ed. 1963 by P.

Professor Fritz Schulz places the Roman jurist Iulianus in the context of the growth and development of Roman law, praising his personal contribution made when Roman jurisprudence reached its full height: > The heroic age of creative geniuses and daring pioneers had passed away with > the Republic.

Often they led caretaker detachments or were the sole caretakers of ungarrisoned fortifications and other facilities. In both armies the rank insignia consisted of three inverted chevrons with a 5-pointed star above it.

He won three Super Bowls as a defensive line coach in the National Football League (NFL) with the Denver Broncos (1997, 1998) and Indianapolis Colts (2006). The annual award for NFL's best defensive line coach is named after Teerlinck. Twenty-three of the players he coached were selected to the Pro Bowl and three were inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. This success has led Teerlinck to be regarded as one of the NFL's greatest defensive line coaches. Early life Teerlink was born in Rochester, New York. He attended Fenwick High School, where he earned All- Chicago Catholic League honors. Playing career Teerlink played college football for the Western Illinois Leathernecks. He studied Fred Dryer and employed those moves in his play. \\"We used to get New York Giants games at Western and I'd watch No. 89, Fred Dryer, and copy his moves\\", Teerlinck said.Chicago A co-captain as a senior at Western Illinois University, he recorded 122 tackles and 14 sacks. He was named the team's defensive most valuable player and was voted a third-team Little All-American by the Associated Press. Teerlink was selected by the San Diego Chargers as the 105th overall pick in the 1974 NFL Draft. He played 20 games with them from 1974 to 1975 before being forced to retire with a knee injury. Coaching career Teerlinck coached 32 NFL playoff games, including six conference championship games and four Super Bowls. Teerlinck earned three Super Bowl rings with two teams (Denver Broncos 1997, 1998 and Indianapolis Colts 2006). His coaching career ended after the 2011 season, when he was fired by the Colts after their 2‚Äì14 season. Regarded by some as the greatest defensive line coach of all time, Teerlinck established an NFL presence in the early 1990s. \\"John Teerlinck is kind of like Mr. Miyagi\\", John Randle said. \\"He's very unorthodox. A different breed. Rough around the edges. He tells you things that are funny, but they register if you just listen. That's why he's the guru.\\"startribune He is the namesake of the John Teerlinck Award, given annually to the best defensive line coach in the NFL. As a pass-rush specialist, Teerlinck coached 23 Pro Bowl players, including two conference defensive players of the year in Michael Dean Perry with the Cleveland Browns in 1989 and Chris Doleman with the Minnesota Vikings in 1992. Three of his former players‚ÄîKevin Greene with the Los Angeles Rams along with Randle and Doleman from the Vikings‚Äîhave been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Randle selected Teerlinck to be his Hall of Fame presenter at his induction ceremony in 2010. Previously, only 10 assistant coaches had presented out of 260 inductees. In his tenure, Teerlinck coached seven players (Doleman, Greene, Randle, Bubba Baker, Neil Smith, Freeney and Robert Mathis) to 100 career sacks. Teerlinck developed a reputation for teaching his players to hit quarterbacks low at the knees. With the Detroit Lions in 1996, the allegations were substantial enough that then-NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue summoned him to a meeting for a warning. Personal life Teerlinck and his wife, Sue, had five children: Ann, Bill, Mark, Molly and Mary. Bill followed in his father's footsteps and went into coaching. He was an assistant under his father with the Colts from 2007 to 2011, and later became a defensive line coach in the NFL and college football. Teerlinck died on May 10, 2020, at the age of 69.

Located in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center on the southeastern side of the Vanderbilt University campus, the School of Medicine claims several Nobel laureates in the field of medicine. Through the Vanderbilt Health Affiliated Network, VUSM is affiliated with over 60 hospitals and 5,000 clinicians across Tennessee and five neighboring states, managing more than 2 million patient visits each year. It is considered one of the largest academic medical centers in the United States and is the primary resource for specialty and primary care in hundreds of adult and pediatric specialties for patients throughout the Mid-South. History The Vanderbilt University School of Medicine (abbreviated VUSM) was founded in 1851 as the school of medicine at the University of Nashville and only became affiliated with Vanderbilt University in 1874. The first degrees issued by Vanderbilt University were to 61 Doctors of Medicine in February 1875, thanks to an arrangement that recognized the University of Nashville's medical school as serving both institutions. The arrangement continued for 20 more years, until the school was reorganized under the control of the Vanderbilt Board of Trustees. In the early days, the School of Medicine was owned and operated as a private property of the practicing physicians who composed the faculty and received the fees paid by students. At this time, the course of medical instruction consisted of just three years of schooling, which was extended to four years starting in 1898. Vanderbilt University made no financial contribution to the school's support and exercised no control over admission requirements, the curriculum, or standards for graduation. In 1925, the school moved from the old South Campus across town to the main campus, thus integrating instruction in the medical sciences with the rest of the university. VUSM Main Entrance The school changed fundamentally during the next decades. The new medical campus finally brought together the School of Medicine, its hospital, the outpatient clinics, laboratory space, and medical library into one location. The move also put the school adjacent to the Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, which had been founded in 1909. Other internal developments included the establishment of a department of Pediatrics (1928) and a department of Radiology (1936) and the acquisition of one of the school's first large research grants, a $250,000 award from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1932. The research happening at Vanderbilt during this time included advancements that had far-reaching implications for the practice of medicine. Alfred Blalock and Vivien Thomas conducted research into blue baby syndrome that led to their 1933 medical- first neonatal cardiothoracic surgery, which formed the basis for the development of the Blalock‚ÄìTaussig shunt, a life-saving procedure for infants with the Tetralogy of Fallot. And in the early 1940s, the process for culturing vaccines in chick embryos was developed by Vanderbilt's Ernest William Goodpasture, a feat that allowed for the mass production of vaccines for diseases like yellow fever, smallpox, and typhus. During the latter half of the 20th century, there was a further expansion of the school's clinical mission and research achievements. The school established a formal department of Anesthesiology in 1945 to build on the school's already significant commitment to the use of anesthetics during procedures, which had its roots in the development of the first ether-oxygen apparatus in 1907 by Vanderbilt's James Gwathmey. The research at the school received a boost with the founding of a federally-funded Clinical Research Center in 1960. The services that the school and medical center provided for children grew tremendously with the start of a department of Neonatology and the world's first neonatal intensive care unit in 1961, led by Mildred T. Stahlman, and the Vanderbilt Children's Hospital, which opened its doors in 1970. The research at the school of medicine also garnered two Nobel prizes during this time, with the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine going to Earl Wilbur Sutherland Jr. for his work on cyclic AMP and Stanley Cohen sharing in the 1986 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his work on growth factors. In March 2014, the institution was being sued by the federal government in a whistle-blower case for a decade-long Medicare fraud scheme. In May 2015, a federal court ruled that the Vanderbilt University Medical Center was in violation of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act for laying off 200 employees without adequate notice and would have to pay out $400,000, pending an appeal. In November 2014, the university admitted that one of its scientists fraudulently falsified six years of biomedical research in high-profile journals. The scientist, Igor Dhuza, was a senior research associate hired by Vanderbilt University's Department of Biomedical Engineering. His research was published in Nature Cell Biology, The Journal of Physiology, Circulation, and The FASEB Journal, in 2000-2005; it was cited \\"more than 500 times.\\" While Vanderbilt University owned and operated the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) that serves the medical school for much of its history, in 2016 the hospitals and clinics of the medical center were incorporated into a new entity which operates independent of Vanderbilt University's control. This organization, also called the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, is clinically and academically affiliated with Vanderbilt University. Vanderbilt University School of Medicine ranks 14th among the nation's elite programs, according to U.S. News & World Report's annual ranking of top medical schools for research, released in the 2018 edition of America's Best Graduate Schools. Vanderbilt University School of Medicine also ranks 27th in the top medical schools for primary care. Vanderbilt University School of Medicine also ranks No. 8 in the nation among U.S. medical schools in total grant support provided through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The new ranking raises VUSM's standing two spots from the No. 10 position it held last year. Among VUSM's basic science departments, Biochemistry ranks third; Cell and Developmental Biology, first; Molecular Physiology & Biophysics, third; and Pharmacology, sixth. Six clinical departments ranked among the top 10, including: Internal Medicine, third; Ophthalmology, ninth; Otolaryngology and Hearing & Speech Sciences, sixth; Pediatrics, fourth; Radiology & Radiologic Sciences, eighth; and Surgery, eighth. Medical Center The Vanderbilt University Medical Center is the only Level I Trauma Center in Middle Tennessee. The trauma center serves a large geographic area stretching from Southern Kentucky to Northern Alabama in what amounts to a 65,000-square-mile catchment area. A part of Vanderbilt Health, VUMC has 834 licensed beds between Vanderbilt University Hospital, Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital and Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Hospital. According to U.S. News & World Report's 2015-16 rankings, VUMC is the No. 1 hospital in the Nashville metro area and in Tennessee overall. The following units comprise VUMC: The 11-story Doctor's Office Tower of the Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, which was completed in 2004. * Vanderbilt University Hospital * Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt * Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center * The Vanderbilt Clinic * Vanderbilt Bill Wilkerson Center * Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Hospital * Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital * Eskind Biomedical Library * Vanderbilt Sports Medicine * Dayani Human Performance Center * Vanderbilt Page Campbell Heart Institute * Vanderbilt University School of Medicine * Vanderbilt University School of Nursing With over 21,500 employees (including 2,876 full-time faculty), Vanderbilt is the largest private employer in Middle Tennessee and the second largest in the state (after FedEx, headquartered in Memphis).

After traveling the country he was inspired by the street performance work of the Radical Faeries and the Bread and Puppet Theater in Glover, Vermont. On his return to Philadelphia, Hart founded Spiral Q as a way to use his newfound interest in puppetry, street theatre and pageantry to promote social and political change. To this day, Spiral Q seeks to bring the storytelling techniques of giant puppetry, pageantry, and toy theater to the urban backdrop of Philadelphia. History \\"The Sleeping Giant\\" from Spiral Q's 2007 Peoplehood Pageant Initially, Spiral Q was a shadow puppet theater that staged performances throughout the community. Local activist groups came to Hart to make puppets, props and effigies for demonstrations and educational campaigns. Spiral Q's identity springs from this early work in Philadelphia's HIV/AIDS activist and queer communities, particularly with AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power (ACT UP). In 1997 and 1998 Hart organized the week-long Full-On Puppet Festival in Philadelphia. showcasing puppeteers from around the country. Spiral Q also organized an annual Day of the Dead parade on South Street up through 1999. Both the festival and the parade were set aside so that the organization could focus on community activism. Workshops with a local children's garden led to another model of community performance with children and adults carrying giant puppets that they created in parades and pageants. In 2000 Spiral Q started an annual citywide parade and pageant called Peoplehood. Each October the parade starts at the Paul Robeson House and ends in Clark Park. In addition to neighborhood parades and pageants such as Peoplehood, Philadelphians can get involved with Spiral Q through its Justice Works Program and Education Initiatives. Since 2000, the theater has been located in the East Mantua section of West Philadelphia. Hart left the company he founded in 2003 to pursue other interests.

In addition to composing dozens of other titles, he was also a pianist, arranger, orchestra leader, and record industry executive. Biography Born in New York City, Gross gave his first piano recital at age 10. In 1923, he had a 15-minute piano program on radio station WEAF in New York City. He began performing professionally in the early 1930s, and played piano in bands led by Paul Whiteman, Andre Kostelanetz, Tommy Dorsey, and Raymond Scott. He was also a staff pianist on CBS radio in the 1930s. In 1942, Gross led the orchestra for Frank Sinatra's CBS program, Reflections. After serving in the military during World War II, Gross became an executive at Musicraft Records, where he served as conductor, arranger, and pianist for recording sessions. In 1946, he was approached by noted lyricist Jack Lawrence, who asked permission to add words to an untitled melody Gross had composed. At first Gross was reluctant to cooperate, and after Lawrence presented his finished lyrics, Gross expressed dissatisfaction with the words and title. Lawrence eventually succeeded in finding a publisher for the new work, and shortly thereafter it was recorded by Sarah Vaughan. While it was a modest hit, the song was Vaughan's first solo chart success and marked her transition from jazz artist to popular singing star. \\"Tenderly\\" continued to find favor with jazz and pop musicians over the next few years. However, when vocalist Rosemary Clooney recorded it for Columbia Records in 1952, it became a million-seller and entered the repertoire of pop standards. Clooney later remarked, \\"Technically, it's the most satisfying record I ever made.\\" Over the years the composition has been recorded by Billie Holiday, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Tony Bennett, Louis Armstrong, Chet Baker, Duke Ellington, Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson, Kenny Burrell, Lionel Hampton, Stan Kenton, Eric Dolphy, The Dominoes, Vic Damone, and Chet Atkins. Joan Crawford sang it over the opening credits in the 1953 film Torch Song. Some of Gross's other compositions include \\"Your Love,\\" \\"I'm in a Fog About You,\\" \\"Mexican Moon,\\" \\"How Will I Remember You\\" and \\"Just a Moon Ago.\\" His lyric collaborators included Carl Sigman, Bobby Troup, and Ned Washington.

He also has produced many shows like La Cuchufleta and La G√ºereja Quiere M√°s. However, his most famous TV show was En Familia con Chabelo, which was broadcast every Sunday morning on Televisa's Canal de las Estrellas. This show consisted of contests with people from the audience, gifts and games and was mainly for children. The program ended on Sunday, December 20, 2015 after 47 years. Artistic career Xavier L√≥pez's career really began when he met a famous couple of actors, whose names were \\"Panseco y Gamboa\\". Panseco worked on radio, and Gamboa (Ramiro), worked on TV. This pair was already known in Mexico and they taught Chabelo the basics of the TV business. Xavier L√≥pez was hired as his ‚ÄúChabelo‚Äù character to be the spokesman of Pepsi Cola, for which he traveled all over North and South America. After the contract, he found himself unemployable due to his strong association with the Pepsi brand. He was hired for a show in New York City for a fraction of what he was used to charging, and ended up touring the US for six months with Tongolele. After the tour, he negotiated a return to TV for a half hour daily show. He also appeared as \\"Panchito\\" in Cantinflas film El Extra (1962). =En Familia con Chabelo= Statue created in honor of Xavier Lopez, better known as Chabelo, on permanent display at the Jardin de los Grandes Valores (Garden of Great Values) in Mexico City. L√≥pez had the idea of doing a show where parents and children could participate and enjoy these mornings together. En Familia con Chabelo (In Family with Chabelo) is well known in Latin America, it is a show with games, contests and gifts where Lopez plays the role of TV host, and presents himself as a child named Chabelo. On December 30, 2012, the show was awarded a Guinness Record for its 44 years of uninterrupted broadcast. Xavier L√≥pez was awarded another Guinness Record for portraying the Chabelo character for over 57 years. On November 27, 2015, \\"Chabelo\\" announced via YouTube, the Long-running Mexican TV show \\"En Familia con Chabelo\\" would air its final show on December 20, 2015. People involved in this program are children and their parents, with whom Chabelo interacts and gets them to participate in many contests. At the end of the show there is a famous contest called the Catafixia. This contest allows players exchange their gifts for another which are transmuted by Chabelo himself. This gift could be better than the one they previously had (living rooms, video games, TVs, DVDs, home theaters, microwave ovens) or it could be worse (jokes, candies). Other shows Chabelo has been featured in more than thirty films and recorded more than thirty albums. He also has produced many programs like La Escuelita VIP, and Los Simuladores.

It was located in the municipality of Tarsia, near Cosenza, in Calabria. It was the largest of the fifteen internment camps established by Benito Mussolini between June and September 1940. Over 3,800 Jews were imprisoned at the camp. Location The camp was located in Ferramonti, a rural locality 6 km in south of Tarsia, by the river Crati. The area where it was located is now next to the current exit \\"Tarsia Sud\\" of the A2 motorway. History The construction of Ferramonti began on June 4, 1940, less than a week before Italy entered World War II. The arrest of Jewish citizens began on June 15, and prisoners began arriving at the camp on June 20. Between June, 1940, and August, 1943, there were 3,823 Jewish internees at Ferramonti, of which only 141 were Italian. The majority, 3,682 people, were foreign-born.Judaica Philatelic Resources-Italy (see \\"Ferramonti di Tarsia\\" section) Prisoners organized a nursery, library, school, theater and synagogue. Several couples got married at the camp and 21 children were born. Rabbi Riccardo Pacifici was the spiritual advisor to the Jewish inmates from 1942 to 1943. Unlike the Nazi concentration camps, the Italian camps were neither death camps or slave labor camps. Most of the detainees were allowed to roam freely and nearly all survived their imprisonment unharmed. Six weeks after Mussolini's downfall (September, 1943), the prisoners were released. Many of these internees joined the Allied armed forces. Some of the 1,000 refugees who were shipped to the United States and interned at Camp Oswego, New York came from this camp. Ultimately, they were released and were permitted to stay in the United States.

He played as a back-row forward for France, gaining 25 caps from 1995 to 1999, and was selected in France's 1999 Rugby World Cup squad. He also played with the French Rugby Sevens team and with the French Barbarians. Born 28 October 1968 in Dakar, Senegal to a military father from the Franche-Comt√© and a mother from Lorraine, he was raised in Argel√®s-sur-Mer with his six younger brothers and one younger sister who all play or played rugby at different high levels. Two are or have been international rugby players: Thomas (who was also part of France's 1999 Rugby World Cup squad and is now coach of Dax) and Matthieu. The only girl of the family, Claire, was a semi-professional, winning a French Championship with Toulouges in 2005. The two younger twins, Pierre and Luc are also playing for l'Avenir Castan√©en, a F√©d√©rale 2 side (4th Division), as a centre and openside flanker respectively. Finally, Fran√ßois used to play for USA Perpignan, during the 1990s. Li√®vremont began his rugby career with amateur club √âtoile sportive catalane. He then played for Perpignan, Stade Fran√ßais (Top 14), in 1998 and 2000, as well as Biarritz Olympique. After retiring from rugby, Li√®vremont turned to coaching at US Dax, whom he guided to promotion to the Top 14 in 2007. In a surprise move, French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset, who is now chairman of the IRB, appointed Li√®vremont as the new head coach of the French national side after the 2007 Rugby World Cup, replacing Bernard Laporte. As assistants, former French teammate √âmile Ntamack was appointed to coach the backs, while Didier Reti√®re was nominated as the new forwards coach. In 2010 Li√®vremont coached France to win the 2010 Six Nations Championship and Grand Slam beating England 12‚Äì10. The following year, however, pressure began to mount on him after Six Nation losses to England 17‚Äì9 and Italy 22‚Äì21 ‚Äì the latter of which was the first time Italy had beaten France, and came after France had led by twelve points with twenty minutes remaining and the next week France beat Wales 28‚Äì9. At the 2011 Rugby World Cup, he guided France to the final where they played New Zealand, losing 8-7 after a very well played game. Li√®vremont branded a section of his squad \\"spoilt brats\\" after he discovered some players went out to celebrate the semi-final win against Wales. He also did not make an appearance for the after-match interview, sending his assistant instead. However, veteran back-rower Imanol Harinordoquy, who publicly criticized Li√®vremont during the tournament for browbeating the team in the media, indicated after the tournament that the team had rebelled against him after the pool stage, and had effectively managed themselves in the knockout rounds.

It may be done using a well stimulator structure or using off shore ships / drilling vessels, also known as \\"Well stimulation vessels\\". Cleaning the formation The assortment of drilling fluid pumped down the well during drilling and completion can often cause damage to the surrounding formation by entering the reservoir rock and blocking the pore throats (the channels in the rock throughout which the reservoir fluids flow). Similarly, the act of perforating can have a similar effect by jetting debris into the perforation channels. Both these situations reduce the permeability in the near well bore area and so reduce the flow of fluids into the well bore. A simple and safe solution is to pump diluted acid mixtures from surface into the well to dissolve the offending material. Once dissolved, permeability should be restored and the reservoir fluids will flow into the well bore, cleaning up what is left of the damaging material. After initial completion, it is common to use minimal amounts of formic acid to clean up any mud and skin damage. In this situation, the process is loosely referred to as \\"well stimulation.\\" Oftentimes, special interest groups that oppose oil and gas production refer to the process as \\"acidization,\\" which is actually the use of acids in high volume and high pressure to stimulate oil production. In more serious cases, pumping from surface is insufficient as it does not target any particular location downhole and reduces the chances of the chemical retaining its effectiveness when it gets there. In these cases, it is necessary to spot the chemical directly at its target through the use of coiled tubing. Coiled tubing is run in hole with a jetting tool on the end. When the tool is at its target, the chemical is pumping through the pipe and is jetted directly onto the damaged area. This can be more effective than pumping from surface, though it is much more expensive, and accuracy is dependent on knowing the location of the damage. Extending the perforation tunnels and fractures In cased hole completions, perforations are intended to create a hole through the steel casing so that the reservoir can be produced. The holes are typically formed by shaped explosives that perforate the casing and create a fractured hole into the reservoir rock for a short distance. In many cases, the tunnels created by the perforation guns do not provide enough surface area and it becomes desirable to create more area in contact with the wellbore. In some cases, more area is needed if the reservoir is of low permeability. In other cases, damage caused by drilling and completion operations can be severe enough that the perforation tunnel does not effectively penetrate through the damaged volume near the bore. This means that the ability of fluids to flow into the existing perforation tunnels is too limited. One method to achieve more stimulation is by carrying out a hydraulic fracture treatment through the perforations. If permeability is naturally low, then as fluid is drained from the immediate area, replacement fluid may not flow into the void sufficiently quickly to make up for the voidage and so the pressure drops. The well cannot then flow at a rate sufficient to make production economic. In this case, extending a hydraulic fracture deeper into the reservoir will allow higher production rates to be achieved. Hydraulic fracturing is performed by injecting high pressure fluids into the wellbore and into the perforation tunnels to cause the rock formation to fracture. This can either be done by injecting hydraulic fluid from surface, a process called hydraulic fracturing or using an explosive to generate a high speed gas flow, a process called propellant stimulation. Propellant stimulations can be a very economical way to clean up nearbore damage. Propellants are a low-explosive material that generate large amounts of gas downhole very rapidly. The gas pressure builds in the wellbore, increasing tension in the rock until it becomes greater than the breakdown pressure of the formation. Fracture length and fracture pattern are highly dependent on the type of propellant stimulation tool that is used. Lifting the well Some stimulation techniques do not necessarily mean altering the permeability outside the well bore. Sometimes they involve making it easier for fluids to flow up the well bore having already entered. Gas lift is sometimes considered a form of stimulation, particularly when it is only used for starting up the well and shut off during steady state operation. More commonly though, lifting as a stimulation refers to trying to lift out heavy liquids that have accumulated at the bottom, either through water entry from the formation or through chemicals injected from surface such as scale inhibitors and methanol (hydrate inhibitor). These liquids sit at the bottom of the well as can act as a weight holding back the flow of reservoir fluids, essentially acting to kill the well. They can be removed by circulating nitrogen using coiled tubing. Well stimulation vessels In more recent times, due to the temporary nature of well stimulation, specialized drilling ships known as \\"well stimulation vessels\\" have been used for deep sea well stimulation. Offshore companies such as Norshore and Schlumberger operate a fleet of such specialized ships. Also known as \\"Multipurpose drilling vessels\\", these ships replace the conventional drilling oil rig, thus resulting in considerable savings in cost. Some WSV's such as the \\"Norshore Atlantic\\" are able to perform multiple tasks including riserless operation in the shallow- and mid-water segments, drilling complete oil wells and performing complete subsea decommissioning (P&A;). They are also able to perform pre-drilling of the top hole sections in deep water and well intervention operations with workover risers.

The speed dial numbers are usually accessed by pressing a pre- determined key or keys on the phone, followed by a one or two-digit code which the user assigns to each number; however for ease of use, on many systems a call may be placed by pressing and holding one key on the numeric keypad. Speed dialing is also available via Custom Calling features from the Telephone Company's Central Office. The numbers are programmed by the subscriber through the standard telephone dial, and speed dial calls are placed by dialing simply the digit and waiting a few seconds on a standard rotary dial phone and an older 10 key Touch Tone phone, or by dialing the number and the # key to instantly connect the call on a modern 12 key Touch Tone phone. Most mobile phones have a contact list feature which provides similar abilities although most have an instant call button which only requires one click. History The capability for speed dial historically dates at least as far back as the Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS) in 1965.http://techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2015/1/28/AT&T-Archives- Electronic-Central-Office-Debut-Succasunna- NJ-1965;http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=3625 Other early \\"instant dialers\\" dating back to 1972 also included punched card machines and magnetic tape machines.http://www.britishtelephones.com/auto201.htm Metal-oxide- semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) telephone technology enabled speed dialing on push-button telephones in the early 1970s. MOS memory chips were used to store phone numbers, which could then be used for speed dialing at the push of a button. This was demonstrated by the British companies Pye TMC, Marconi-Elliott and GEC in 1970. Between 1971 and 1973, the American company Bell Laboratories develop a push-button MOS telephone called the \\"Touch-O- Matic\\" phone, which could store up to 32 phone numbers. This was made possible by the low cost, low power requirements, small size and high reliability of MOS transistors, over 15,000 of which were contained on ten IC chips, including one chip for logic, one for the dial interface, and eight for memory.

They do not receive government funding, therefore services are available for anyone performing wildland duties: volunteers, contract firefighters, agency firefighters, pilots, equipment operators, etc.  History  In 1994 thirty-four wildland firefighters were killed in the line of duty. Fourteen men and women died in a single incident on the South Canyon, or what is known by most as the \\"Storm King\\" fire, in Colorado. The loss of so many wildland firefighters caused tremendous grief to many, and helped spur the idea to form some type of entity that could help the families of the fallen. Vicki Minor, a private contractor, was running a dry-goods commissary on a fire in New Mexico at the time Storm King occurred. Ms. Minor was so touched by what had happened and couldn't help but wonder who was helping the families through the tragedy ‚Äì most specifically, how would they get by financially until they received some benefits. She donated a large sum of her own money to go toward helping the families and recognizing those who had died. After working a number of years with government fire agency staff, the Wildland Firefighter Foundation was formed and created in 1999, becoming fully incorporated with by-laws and a mission statement. The Foundation was a mix of private individuals and government employees, serving in a liaison capacity, that helped bring about the groundbreaking and subsequent dedication in May 2000, of the Wildland Firefighters National Monument at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) in Boise, Idaho. The Wildland Firefighter Foundation is a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization, located in Boise, Idaho. The Foundation receives funding through private donations from individuals, organizations, corporations, and foundations. Their Board of Directors represent the private sector, fire service, survivor families, and government. The Foundation is in the process of forming an Advisory Board to lend additional expertise and support to the Foundation's programs. The Wildland Firefighter Foundation relies on private donations.

The site was started by the journalist and author Robert Wright and the blogger and journalist Mickey Kaus on November 1, 2005. Kaus has since dropped out of operational duties of the site as he didn't want his frequent linking to be seen as a conflict of interest. Most of the earlier discussions posted to the site involved one or both of those individuals, but since has grown to include a total of over one thousand individual contributors, mostly journalists, academics, scientists, authors, well known political bloggers, and other notable individuals. Unregistered users are able to view all of the videos which are contained on the site, while free registration is required to comment on the individual discussions, or participate in the forums.  Format  Bloggingheads discussions are conducted via webcam between two (or more) people, and can be viewed online in Flash format, or downloaded as WMV video files, MP4 video files, or MP3 sound files.Bloggingheads.tv New diavlogs are generally posted daily, and are all archived for future viewing. The diavlogs are generally broken up into a series of topics and subtopics a few minutes in length, links to which are placed below the video window to allow viewers to navigate to a given topic if they do not wish to view the whole discussion. Most of the discussions posted to Bloggingheads.tv involve well known (or semi-well known) journalists, bloggers, science writers, scientists, philosophers, book authors, or other specialists in segments of current world events. Many of the discussions are of a political nature or are related to the current political environment. Those with differing points of view are often matched against one another. Diavlogs involving guests appearing for the first time often take the form of an interview, more often than that of a discussion, with a longtime Bloggingheads contributor playing the role of interviewer. =Regular segments= Although most episodes and matchups do not occur on any kind of a regular basis, there are a few notable exceptions to this. There is a frequent diavlog matchup between the two co-founders of Bloggingheads.tv, Robert Wright and Mickey Kaus, generally related to politics in some form, that usually occurs on either Wednesday or Thursday. While some of the other diavloggers are frequently matched against each other (e.g. David Corn & James Pinkerton) there is usually not a regularly scheduled time at which they take place. John Horgan and George Johnson in a discussion on a \\"Science Saturday\\" episode of Bloggingheads.tv. \\"Science Saturday\\" was the name given to the weekly episode appearing on Saturday that was always science related. Its last episode was released on December 24, 2011. It usually (but not always) involved either one or both of the science writers John Horgan and George Johnson. Many well-known people in the science community were a part of Science Saturday, including Michael Shermer of Skeptic Magazine, biologist PZ Myers, Craig Venter of the Human Genome Project, aging researcher and biogerentologist Aubrey de Grey, and philosopher David Chalmers, among many others. However, in September 2009, four high-profile science bloggers who had previously participated in Bloggingheads.tv discussions publicly distanced themselves from the site and stated they would no longer agree to appear in Bloggingheads.tv segments. The scientists ‚Äì Sean Carroll, Carl Zimmer, Phil Plait and PZ Myers ‚Äì all criticized what they claimed was a policy by Bloggingheads.tv to provide a platform for the anti-scientific ideology, Creationism without an opposing point of view for balance. PZ Myers said: \\"[Bloggingheads.tv] was setting up crackpots with softball interviews that made them look reasonable, because their peculiar ideas were never confronted.\\" Aubrey de Grey being interviewed by Eliezer Yudkowsky on Bloggingheads.tv. \\"The Week in Blog\\" was a weekly segment which normally appeared on the site on Fridays. Its last episode was released on March 7, 2012. The format was to discuss what has showed up on the past week on both liberal and conservative blogs, from both a liberal and conservative viewpoint. The three regular hosts of \\"TWIB\\" were Bill Scher of Liberal Oasis, Kristin Soltis of the Winston Group, and Matt Lewis of The Daily Caller. Original host Conn Carroll of The Heritage Foundation stepped aside in early 2009. Guests who appeared on the show are Armando Llorens (of Daily Kos), Amanda Carpenter, and Nate Silver (of FiveThirtyEight) among many others.  History  On November 1, 2005, the site launched, with Robert Wright and Mickey Kaus as the only two initial participants in the video discussions. The site has since featured more than one thousand other diavloggers. On October 18, 2006, a site redesign was launched, with a revised home page and improved functionality: ability to comment on diavlogs was added, and to participate in forum discussions. In January 2007, it was announced that cable TV pioneer and C-SPAN founding chairman Bob Rosencrans, with a loose network of others, would become an angel investor of Bloggingheads.tv. The infusion of cash kicked off a dramatic expansion of the site's content, and a corresponding growth in viewers. On March 24, 2007, in a diavlog between Garance Franke-Ruta and Ann Althouse, Althouse became quite animated and angry (to the point of yelling) over a comment Franke-Ruta made (in reference to an earlier controversy involving Jessica Valenti and former US president Bill Clinton) referred to as an on-air \\"meltdown\\" by some. This led to many blog posts and news stories in the following days on both the initial controversy and Althouse's on air behavior. On October 13, 2007, a conversion to Flash format from the initial Windows Media format took place. On October 24, 2007, Bloggingheads.tv entered into a relationship with The New York Times, whereby selected video segments from the Bloggingheads site would appear in the \\"Videos\\" section on the Times website, under the Opinion subsection. On December 13, 2007, a site redesign took place which removed the familiar green pages in favor of a more \\"Web 2.0\\"-look, featuring more user generated content, new navigation, new forum software for the \\"comments\\" section, and other updated features. In 2008, several new segments and diavloggers were added or made more regular, including \\"Free Will\\", \\"This Week in Blog\\", and \\"UN Plaza\\". Other updates and tweaks to the site, such as the addition of the MP4 video format were also gradually phased in. =Media recognition= Traditional media outlets, such at The New York Times and others, have written mostly favorable reviews of Bloggingheads.tv. Stories are also often written about individuals who take part in the video discussions, as they are often well known individuals in the scientific, academic, journalism, or blogosphere community. The majority of coverage of the site, however, has been in the form of blog coverage sometimes on the form of the blog of the person participating in the Bloggingheads discussion, and sometimes in the form of other blogs. Some events and personality appearances on Bloggingheads.tv have led to larger than usual amounts of media coverage, such as the March 24, 2007 Ann Althouse controversy described above, and the appearance of Andrew Sullivan on December 26, 2006 and January 1, 2007, when he discussed in the most clear terms up to that point his reversal of viewpoint on the Iraq War, and his plea of apology for supporting it in the first place. Site terms, features, and technology =\\"Diavlog\\"= The term \\"diavlog\\" (sometimes written \\"dia-vlog\\" by some bloggers ) means a type of video blog (or \\"vlog\\") generally in which two people participate, as contrasted with a (mono)vlog in which one contributor is featured. The word \\"diavlog\\" is a portmanteau of the phrase \\"dialog video weblog\\" (or, alternately, \\"video weblog dialog\\"). The diavlog format is most popular for political, world events, or other types of conversational video blog discussions in which two (or more) people are actively participating in a real-time, give-and-take discussion of ideas. The term \\"diavlog\\" was first adopted and put into wide use by Bloggingheads.tv contributors, (initially by Robert Wright and Mickey Kaus), though its original coinage is subject to debate. The term is widely used both by people on air, as well as commentors, refer to a specific conversation. Although initially coined on the Bloggingheads site, the term has come to be used in other parts of the blogosphere and among journalists who frequently (or infrequently) participate in the encounters. The term is sometimes spelled \\"diavlogue\\" by those outside the United States. (see: American and British English spelling differences) =Direct video linking (\\"dingalink\\") and embedding= Button used to direct link to a relevant part of the video or to embed video in another website. Dingalink is a direct link to a specific place in a video. (a beginning time and an end time) Dingalinks have the ability for users to direct viewers directly to a relevant part of a video, without the viewer having to watch the video in its entirety. They are used with video blogs when others who write blogs, articles, emails, etc., have the aim of discussing only one segment of an entire video post. The term was named after Bloggingheads.tv's technical advisor Greg Dingle, who initially developed the technology. On Bloggingheads.tv, direct linking is often useful in the discussion surrounding a specific \\"diavlog\\" to refer to a particular point (or points) in the discussion to clarify what is being commented on. The direct linking can be automatically generated from the Bloggingheads Flash video player, through the adjustment of the beginning and end of the video that one might want to display. (Start/End time can also be manually edited once the code is generated.) Embedding of video is a feature that was added to Bloggingheads.tv in 2008 as a consequence of converting to Flash Video. It allows for bloggers and other websites to embed the video player into their blog or website so that the content can be viewed locally instead of the need to visit the actual Bloggingheads.tv site. This feature is similar to the YouTube and Google Video (among others) feature which had previously become prevalent on the internet. =Visual aids= Wright and Kaus compare stuffed moose visual aids. Due to the fairly limited medium of using webcams to record the video used in the Bloggingheads.tv episodes, a variety of visual aids and enhancements are sometimes added to the program by the participants. Generally this takes the form of holding up books, newspapers, or other objects that are being discussed to the camera, but sometimes it involves other, more exotic, items to either enhance a point or add something to the diavlog. Mickey Kaus is particularly known for using visual aids such as masks (of Al Gore, Laura Bush, and others), an Ann Coulter doll, and perhaps most recognizably, a stuffed moose doll. According to Kaus, \\"deploying the moose\\" symbolizes Pinch Sulzberger's idea of \\"the unaddressed important issue\\" similar to the \\"elephant in the room.\\" Robert Wright has since received a stuffed moose of his own. Also, various live animals (usually pets) have been displayed onscreen during the course of conversations. Wright has displayed his family pet, a poodle mix named Frazier, several times. (Frazier was popular enough to subsequently get his own Facebook and Twitter profiles.Frazier's Facebook profileFrazier's Twitter profile) Other people have had their cat displayed onscreen, such as that of Ana Marie Cox, John McWhorter, and Jonah Goldberg. Other interesting onscreen visual aids that have been employed include the use of a kazoo by Matt Welch, hats by various people (e.g. a Santa hat by Jonah Goldberg, and a New Year's Day hat by Mickey Kaus), and the display of a sextant by Robert Farley in a discussion on pirates.  Contributors to Bloggingheads.tv  While many of the initial diavlogs featured Wright and Kaus exclusively, other regular participants at Bloggingheads.tv have grown to include many differing ideologies and viewpoints, politically, scientifically, and philosophically. Regular contributors include Ann Althouse, Peter Beinart, Rosa Brooks, Jonathan Chait, David Corn, Ross Douthat, Daniel Drezner, Conor Friedersdorf, Jonah Goldberg, John Horgan, Ezra Klein, Eli Lake, Glenn Loury, Megan McArdle, John McWhorter, James Pinkerton, Mark Schmitt and Matthew Yglesias, among many others. Apart from the regular contributors, a host of well known occasional guests have appeared, usually in the form of being interviewed. Among others, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama talked about his book America at the Crossroads; the Israeli journalist Gershom Gorenberg discussed his book The Accidental Empire (about the history of the settlements); The Washington Post columnist Joel Achenbach on an article of his about global-warming skeptics (among other topics); Andrew Sullivan on his book The Conservative Soul; biogerentologist Aubrey de Grey on how to defeat the \\"disease\\" of aging; philosopher David Chalmers; Nate Silver (of FiveThirtyEight.com); and Craig Venter, director of the Human Genome Project, who spoke of future scientific innovations he is currently pursuing.

Formerly a farming community, it is now home to approximately twenty families. It is located near Canterbury, New Brunswick. History The settlement is named for Thomas Robinson Hartin Sr. Reverend, who encouraged people to settle in this area in 1865. It was settled primarily by Episcopalians from different parts of the province. The petition by Thomas Hartin to found the settlement was signed in 1862 by Surveyor General, John McMillan. By 1866, Hartin Settlement was a farming community with approximately 26 families. Most of these families survived off of small farms on their land. During this time every land owner had to clear trees and have a building on their property. The community also had to work together to maintain the road. Hartin Settlement had a schoolhouse for grades one to eight. The Chief Superintendent of Education noted it as: \\"This school is well equipped and does very good work\\" Being a rural school, it closed in 1967 due to the Equal Opportunity Program and was demolished in 1983/84. In 1889, a total of 5 people had been infected by an outbreak of diphtheria. On 25 November 1886, Elisha Lewis found an unknown man's body near Hartin Settlement at a location now known as Dead Man's Corner. Because he could not be identified by the coroner, a description was posted in the Press Newspaper on 8 December 1886: \\"Deceased was about 5 feet 8 inches in height, and about 65 years of age. He wore a brown reefer, lined with blue flannel, no vest, colored pants, blue woolen outside shirt, plaided homespun inside shirt and drawers; he had on an old pair of boots, and wore a brown woolen cap. A black felt hat, and pocketbook containing $2.39, was found on his person.\\" This description matched that of a fugitive from Maine named Calvin Graves, who was being pursued for the murder of two game wardens in Maine. This unknown male was the first to be buried in the Hartin Settlement Cemetery, because no one could determine his religious denomination. From about 1886-1933 members of the Annis family who died were buried in the Hartin Settlement cemetery alongside members of the Oliver family, and the unknown man. The cemetery wasn‚Äôt kept up well, and it was soon overgrown. The first attempt to restore it was made in the 1940s, and again around 1972. In 1979, people of the community began restoring it again and found out some of the forgotten names of people buried there. Finally in 2016, it was fully cleared, and even more people were found there amounting to ten in total. Hartin Settlement got power in 1950, and around this time about 104 people lived in the community.

Along with her grandson Ahmad‚Äîwho refers to her as \\"Big Mama\\"  she serves as the moral and emotional center of the film. Additionally, she makes recurring appearances in flashback sequences on the television series. She is the subject of \\"A Song for Mama\\", the R&B; tune by Boyz II Men which serves as the film's theme song. Josephine is portrayed by Irma P. Hall. Character Background Josephine was born and raised in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, along with her brother Pete and her two sisters, Ruthie (Diahann Carroll) and Twig. When she met future husband Jeremiah Joseph (Larry Marshall), Ruthie and Twig disapproved. The sisters' relationship never fully recovered from the resulting argument. After Jeremiah ran afoul of the Ku Klux Klan, he and Josephine moved to Chicago, along with his best friend Hardy Lester (Richard Roundtree) and Hardy's wife Ella (Gloria Foster). Jeremiah and Hardy would eventually open a local grocery store together.In the film, Jeremiah owned a barbershop and a laundromat in addition to the grocery store, and was the sole proprietor of all three businesses. The Josephs raised three daughters: Teri, Maxine, and Tracy, whom they nicknamed \\"Bird\\". The family began a tradition of gathering together on Sunday afternoons for dinner, irrespective of whatever else was on an individual's personal schedule. The tradition remained unbroken for approximately 40 years. Josephine was a beloved woman with deep moral and spiritual roots. Her presence helped to keep the family grounded, particularly after Jeremiah's death. Soon after her daughter Bird married Lem Van Adams (and after Maxine gave birth to a daughter, Brooke), Josephine was hospitalized for complications resulting from diabetes. During an operation in which her leg was amputated, she suffered a stroke and fell into a coma. Although she briefly regained consciousness weeks later while Ahmad was visiting, she had a relapse after mere minutes and died. Josephine's presence within the Joseph family was a strong one. After her death, her grandson Ahmad and her daughters all maintained vivid memories of her. At times, it even seemed that she was appearing to them in angelic form.

The village is centrally located being around 4 miles from the local principal towns of Llantrisant to the southwest and Pontypridd to the north and is situated around 10 miles northwest of Cardiff city centre. History Historically the village was known as Cross Inn and fell within the traditional county of Glamorgan. Church Village itself does not share the extent of industrial mining heritage of much of the rest of the county and largely comprises new and recent build housing. It is a rapidly growing urban area, today almost a town rather than a village, being much sought after to live in due to its proximity to Cardiff and Pontyclun, being rated one of Wales' least deprived areas with the best access to services in the country. Church Village is also commonly used to refer to the whole CF38 postcode area of Pontypridd, comprising the adjoining principal settlements of ‚Äì Beddau, Efail Isaf, Llantwit Fardre, Ton-Teg, Tyn-y-Nant and Upper Church Village. Church village was served by Church Village railway station on the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway until 1964. Costain, under contract from Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council constructed a bypass to reduce traffic congestion on the A473, Pontypridd to Bridgend () road, from Cross Inn, near Llantrisant, to Tonteg via Efail Isaf. The Church Village bypass, which is built as a single carriageway, with crawler and overtaking lanes around roundabouts opened in September 2010. The village is home to Clare E Potter, a Welsh poet who directed The Wall and the Mirror, an episode of New Voices from Wales. Education Church Village is the site of one of the newest school sites in Wales, which is called Gartholwg Community Campus. This initiative houses a 3‚Äì16 school newly renamed Ysgol Garth Olwg comprising the former primary school ‚Äì Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Garth Olwg and secondary school ‚Äì Ysgol Gyfun Garth Olwg. There is also a pre-school nursery, a community library, Lifelong Learning Centre and a Youth Centre on site. Health Church Village was the site of the East Glamorgan Hospital, an ageing World War II hospital replaced in 2000 by the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in nearby Ynysmaerdy. Religion There are three Christian churches in the area, St. Illtud's, the Parish church, Capel Y Bedyddwyr Cymraeg Salem (Salem Welsh Baptist Chapel, with English and Welsh services) and Bethel Baptist Chapel. All three churches have a strong and healthy relationship between them which is constantly developing. The Parish church of St. Illtyd's has been serving the community for hundreds of years, but Salem and Bethel have developed in the last 100 years. Bethel was formed owing to schism, wishing for English services compared to the, then, complete Welsh Salem which was already established in the area. However, in the last 50 years Salem adopted an evening English service and is enjoying a morning family service under the current Pastor. Salem Chapel is widely known as the chapel (and resting place) of former Deacon and Arweinydd y gan, John Hughes, who wrote the famous hymn tune Cwm Rhondda (Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah). Governance Church Village is also the name of an electoral ward to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. It forms the immediate area around Church Village and Upper Church Village. The ward elects one county councillor. A 2018 review of electoral arrangements would see an increase in the number of councillors to two (and a realignment of the east boundary), effective from the 2022 council elections. Church Village is also a community ward for Llantwit Fardre Community Council, electing four of the twelve community councillors.

It is based on a 1962 novel of the same name by Stanley Wolpert. The movie was written by Nelson Gidding and filmed in England and India with mainly white actors in prominent roles. It stars Horst Buchholz, Diane Baker, Jose Ferrer, and Robert Morley. It was shot in CinemaScope DeLuxe Color. Synopsis The film is a fictional narrative set in the nine hours in the life of Nathuram Godse (Horst Buchholz) that led up to his assassination of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (J.S. Casshyap). As he prepares for the shooting at Gandhi's residence, flashbacks recall Godse's hostility to Muslims, his adherence to a militant Hindu group that hatches the plot to kill Gandhi, and his involvement with a married woman Rani (Valerie Gearon) and a prostitute Sheila (Diane Baker). Meanwhile, a police officer Supt. Gopal Das (Jose Ferrer) attempts to find the killer before it is too late. Cast * J. S.

The stem presents opposite leaves that start out green and rather broad and, later, become more narrow and reddish in colour. The leaves especially become red under intense light. There are several varieties, of unknown status, that differ in leaf shape and colour. The flowers are inconspicuous, growing from the leaf axils of emersed plants. Cultivation These plants prefer intense light for optimum growth. They can grow quickly in the right conditions and will grow in flooded conditions, if the water is shallow enough. They also grow very well with additional carbon dioxide added to the water. Ideal water conditions are soft and acidic, but these plants are generally hardy and adaptable in most moderate conditions. To grow well, they need a good iron micronutrient to be added to an aquarium. They can be easily propagated by pushing cuttings into the substrate. Bibliography * Turrill, W. B. et al., eds. 1952‚Äì.

It was filmed in Techniscope and Technicolor. Uys himself plays Anton De Vries, a concert pianist whose 8-year-old son Dirkie is the central character. Dirkie is played by Uys's real-life son Wynand Uys, credited as Dirkie Hayes. The plot was paralleled two years later by the far more successful \\"Walkabout\\". Plot The story is about 8-year-old Dirkie DeVries (Wynand Uys, credited as Dirkie Hayes), who is flying with his Uncle Pete (Pieter Hauptfleisch) across the Kalahari Desert in a small plane, piloted by Uncle Pete, who partway into the flight has a heart attack and partially loses control of the plane. Thanks to his struggles to land safely in the desert even while suffering the heart attack, the crash is not as serious as it might have been otherwise, and, while Pete himself dies, Dirkie and his small pet dog survive, and the bulk of the story follows Dirkie's various adventures while he struggles to survive the harsh desert conditions, including an encounter with Kalahari Desert Bushmen, who give him help, but abandon him after an unfortunate misunderstanding concerning Dirkie's dog. In his attempt to light a fire to keep the hyenas away he blows up the plane destroying the radio transmitter. This also changes the colour of the plane. The helicopters are looking for a red and white striped plane, but it is now black. The story alternates between Dirkie in the desert and Dirkie's father Anton DeVries (played by the director Jamie Uys) and follows his increasingly desperate efforts to locate his son, including having two million leaflets specially printed and spread over the desert from a plane, containing instructions for Dirkie on how to survive in the desert, and assuring him that his father loves him and won't give up trying to rescue him. Dirkie fares remarkably well and appears to be saved when he meets a bushman and his son. However, when they feed him meat he misunderstands and thinks he is eating his own dog. He runs off and throws stones at the bushman. This ingratitude is not received well and the bushman sets fire to his own hut and wanders away with his son. Dirkie finds the dog, but cannot entice the bushman back, and the bushman now throws stones at Dirkie. He wanders deeper into the desert and collapses. Ultimately Anton travels to the Kalahari Desert himself after everything else fails to make progress. (He has had to mortgage his house to pay for the expenses of finding Dirkie after a newspaper backs out of an earlier offer to assist with expenses.) In the desert, he meets one of the Bushmen who had earlier met Dirkie, and gets information about the direction Dirkie was last seen going in, and he is finally able to find Dirkie, who looks as if he is close to death. His dog is still with him, although injured. The film ends with Dirkie (unconscious) in his father's arms, together with his little dog (still alert), both being carried back to the vehicle his father had travelled there in. The DVD re-issue states that the film is based on a true story. Music Music plays a very important role in this film, especially classical piano music resulting from Dirkie's father being a concert pianist. Classical piano music is used several times in the film's soundtrack: particularly compositions by Franz Liszt and Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, to the point that Liszt's Liebestraum no. 3 in A-flat major (S./G. 541, R. 211, no. 3) and Chopin's Polonaise no. 6 in A-flat major, op. 53 (\\"Polonaise h√©ro√Øque\\") almost become de facto themes for the film. Some of the climactic portions of the Liebestraum form a sweeping sonic backdrop to early scenes in the desert (before the crash landing), showing a lunch stop in the empty desert and then taking off and resuming the flight. There is a striking and emotionally intense scene in which Dirkie's father is practising the Polonaise at home and his worry about Dirkie causes him to have a sudden emotional breakdown, in which he interrupts his playing by hitting the piano's keyboard angrily with his fists and producing loud crashing discords. In addition, the very opening scene of the actual story (after the differing introductions to the two versions of the film) shows Dirkie and his father playing Chopsticks together on the piano as a duet. Other than classical pieces, original music for the film was composed by Art Heatley and Sam Sklair with a faux African musical cue by William Loose. One German web site also credits Gilbert Gibson as another composer for the film. However, the DVD credits only Sklair for original music. The Australian jazz singer Edwin Duff (1928‚Äì2012) is credited in the end titles as singing the theme song \\"Wait for Tomorrow\\". However current versions of the movie do not include the song. Release The film was first released in 1969. Reactions and legacy The film was not widely available for many years after its original release, but discussions on film- related forums and personal blogs show that aspects of the film are remembered very vividly by those who saw it as children. Discussions and memories of the film posted online suggest that viewers appear to have been haunted by scenes from the film for many years, without being able to identify the film itself. Certain scenes are regarded with some unease or horror, possibly even casting doubt on whether the film is suitable for children, although its overall style seems to suggest that it was conceived as a children's film. Lead actor Wynand Uys did not act again. He and his wife Marie-Tinka ran the Otters Den nature reserve and outdoor activity centre near Hoedspruit, South Africa where he is also the chair of the local flying club.https://za.linkedin.com/in/wynand- uys-01551a124. Director Jamie Uys became best known outside South Africa for making the first two films in The Gods Must Be Crazy series. He died in 1996. The film was released on DVD in 2005. On the cover the credits for Jamie Hayes and Dirkie Hayes use their real family name Uys. Differences between the two language versions Lost in the Desert was shot in two versions, one in Afrikaans and the other in English. The Afrikaans version appeared in 1969 under the title Dirkie, and the English version appeared in either 1969 or 1970 (possibly varying according to country) under the title Dirkie Lost in the Desert, which was sometimes referred to and marketed as Lost in the Desert, which is possibly an alternative official title for the English version. The film was released on DVD in 2005 (copyright 1999), and this disc contains both versions of the film, selectable from the front menu. The English version is about 70 minutes long, and the Afrikaans version rather shorter. Most of the scenes are exactly the same in both versions, but both contain a few scenes which are not included in the other. For example, the Afrikaans version starts with a scene showing Dirkie's father Anton Hayes, who is a concert pianist, playing Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu in C-sharp minor, Op. 66 (posth.) before an audience. Instead of this, the English version substitutes some panoramic scenes from the Kalahari Desert (the setting for most of the story), with an announcer narrating a brief history of the desert. One possible reason for this difference might be that the director may have thought that an English-speaking audience might find a little introductory information about the Kalahari Desert useful, but that an Afrikaans audience might find it superfluous. The opening concert scene in the Afrikaans version adds nothing to the story beyond establishing the fact that Dirkie's father is a concert pianist. Also, the presence or absence of music during a prominent scene early in the film differs between the two versions. There are also a few very brief scenes, some only of seconds' duration, that are in one version of the film but not the other. However, overall the Afrikaans version is significantly shorter, thus suggesting that the English one may be more \\"complete\\". One account of the film in discussion forums suggests that, in the 2005 re-release of the film on DVD, the reason for the Afrikaans version being shorter might be that the last reel of this version was lost and so the film was simply truncated on DVD, thus accounting for its reportedly abrupt ending. Telugu remake A hugely popular remake was made in Telugu, a South Indian language, in 1972, with the name Papam Pasivadu with a few minor changes in the storyline to suit the local audience.

He taught drawing and wrote treatises on the subject, evolving a method in which imaginative drawings of landscapes could be worked up from abstract blots on paper. His son was the artist John Robert Cozens. Life Alexander Cozens was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. Widely mistaken to be a natural son of Emperor Peter I of Russia and a British woman ‚Äî Mary Davenport ‚Äî from Deptford, he was, in fact, the son of Richard Cozens (1674‚Äì1735), who worked for Peter I as a shipbuilder.Jean-Claude Lebensztejn's L'art de la tache: Introduction a la Nouvelle methode d'Alexander Cozens, Paris, 1990, pp. 31sq. The emperor was the godfather of Alexander.; text online at He was educated in England from 1727, but later returned to Russia. In 1746 he sailed from St Petersburg to Italy, where he spent two years before travelling onward to England. While in Rome, he worked in the studio of the French landscape painter, Claude-Joseph Vernet. Between 1750 and 1754, Cozens was drawing-master at Christ's Hospital, and in the same decade also began to take private pupils. From 1763 to 1768 he was drawing-master at Eton College. He gave lessons to the Prince of Wales, Sir George Beaumont, and William Beckford, arguably, the three most important British art patrons and collectors of their generation. Beckford continued to correspond with him for some years. He also practised at Bath. In 1760 he was among the contributors to the first public exhibition in London of works by living artists, held in the great room of the Society of Arts. The exhibition was organised by a body of artists who afterward divided into the \\"Free Society\\" and the \\"Incorporated Society of Artists\\". Cozens contributed to the exhibitions of both societies. In 1761 he obtained a prize from the Society of Arts at the exhibition in the Strand of the former, but he was one of the original members of the latter, incorporated in 1766. He also exhibited eight works at the Royal Academy between 1772 and 1781. He married Charlotte Pine, the daughter of John Pine, Bluemantle Pursuivant in the College of Heralds. They left one son, John Robert Cozens, and a daughter, Juliet Ann Cozens (later Roberts).\\"Alexander and John Robert Cozens - The Poetry Of Landscape by Kim Sloan (1986). Alexander Cozens died in Duke Street, Piccadilly, London, on 23 April 1786. Work The style used by Cozens before he finally settled in Britain may be seen in a collection of fifty-four early drawings, mostly Italian scenes, in the British Museum. Cozens lost them in Germany on his way from Rome to Britain, and they were only recovered by his son in Florence in 1776. They show him as a highly skilled draughtsman in the style of the time, with a feeling for elegant composition. Some are wholly in pen and ink in the manner of line engravings. Others show extensive landscapes, elaborately drawn in pencil, and partly finished in ink. Others are washed in monochrome, and some in colour of a timid kind. In most there is little sky, but in one he has attempted a bold effect of sunlight streaming through cloud, and brightly illuminating several distinct spots in the landscape. There are several broad pencil drawings on greenish paper heightened with white. Altogether these show that by this time Cozens was a well-trained artist who observed nature and was not without poetical feeling. After his arrival in Britain he appears, from some drawings in the Victoria and Albert Museum, to have adopted a much broader style, aiming at an imposing distribution of masses and large effects of light and shade. Henry Angelo, who (like Sir George Beaumont) was his pupil at Eton, described Cozens' unusual method of teaching in his Reminiscences: > Cozens dashed out upon several pieces of paper a series of accidental > smudges and blots in black, brown, and grey, which being floated on, he > impressed again upon other paper, and by the exercise of his fertile > imagination, and a certain degree of ingenious coaxing, converted into > romantic rocks, woods, towers, steeples, cottages, rivers, fields, and > waterfalls. Blue and grey blots formed the mountains, clouds, and skies'. An > improvement on this plan was to splash the bottoms of earthenware plates > with these blots, and to stamp impressions therefrom on sheets of damped > paper. In 1785 Cozens published a pamphlet on this manner of drawing landscapes from blots, called A New Method of Assisting the Invention in Drawing Original Compositions of Landscape.A transcription of Cozens's New Method is available in Adolph Paul Opp√©, Alexander and John Robert Cozens, Cambridge, Mass., 1954, 165-87; in Joshua C. Taylor, ed., Nineteenth-Century Theories of Art, Berkeley/Los Angeles/London, 1987, 63-71; and in Jean-Claude Lebensztejn's L'art de la tache: Introduction a la Nouvelle methode d'Alexander Cozens, Paris, 1990, 467-84 and plates. Cozens defined a blot as \\"a production of chance with a small degree of design\\" and acknowledged the influence on his ideas of a passage in Leonardo da Vinci's Treatise on Painting, which recommends that artists should look for inspiration in stains or marks on old walls. Joseph Wright of Derby was influenced by Cozens, owned paintings by him, and used his ideas as inspiration for his compositions. He also described the technique Cozens recommended for creation from blots. In 1778 Cozens published Principles of Beauty relative to the Human Head (a work \\"of more ingenuity than value\\"), with nineteen engravings by Francesco Bartolozzi. The list of subscribers included William Beckford (father of Cozens' pupil William Thomas Beckford), Burke, Garrick, Flaxman, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and other men of culture. In 1782 Thomas Banks exhibited his Head of a Majestic Beauty, composed on Mr.Cozens's principles. Cozens also published The Various Species of Composition in Nature, and The Shape, Skeleton, and Foliage of Thirty-two Species of Trees (1771, reprinted 1786).

She also attended the University of Chicago before starting her career as a high school English teacher. In 1918, she married James Lyall Turnbull, just before his departure for Europe during World War I. He returned, and they were married for 40 years and had one child, a daughter named Martha. The family moved to Maplewood, New Jersey in 1922, where she lived for the rest of her life.Waggoner, Walter H. \\"AGNES TURNBULL, NOVELIST, 93, DIES\\", The New York Times, February 2, 1982.

It is her only novel set in Bronze Age Britain, approximately 900 BCE, and takes place in and around the South Downs in England. Plot summary The Downs; the landscape where Drem grows up The story centres on Drem, a young boy who dreams of becoming a warrior and earning the right to wear a kilt of 'Warrior Scarlet' but fears his crippled right arm will prevent this. To pass the test of manhood, he must kill a wolf on his own; those who fail are expelled from the tribe and sent to the 'Half People' who herd sheep on the South Downs. Drem lives with his elder brother Drustic, grandfather, mother and a girl named Blai, abandoned years before by a travelling blacksmith. He teaches himself to compensate for his disability and at the age of 12 goes to the 'Boys House' to learn how to be a warrior; while there, the Chieftain's son Vortrix becomes his friend and blood brother. At 15, the boys undertake their 'Wolf Slaying' but when it is Drem's turn, he slips and is nearly killed, surviving only when Vortrix wounds the wolf, which escapes. As a result, he is sent to the Half People, only meeting his former friends when they provide the Wolf Guard to protect the sheep. One evening towards the end of winter, Drem sets out to rescue an old shepherd named Doli, who went searching for a lost sheep; he finds him but is attacked by three wolves, including the same one he failed to kill during his Wolf Slaying. This time he succeeds, although badly wounded and is saved only by the arrival of the Wolf Guard. When Drem recovers, he learns that since it was the same wolf and wounded him in the same place, his previous failure has been wiped clean; he has succeeded and later undergoes the initiation ceremony whereby boys become warriors. Drem is shown to have grown emotionally as well; his failure forced him to face his own fear of being an outcast and see others with greater compassion and understanding. The final chapter centres on the Celtic festival of Beltane, which occurs around 1 May and signalled the beginning of the new year; during this festival, couples who wish to be married leap through the flames of a large bonfire. Drem realises he and Blai are both outcasts and belong together; the book ends with them running up the hill to the bonfire.  Historical background and themes  A Bronze-age shield, dated to 1200‚Äì700 BCE; Drem inherits a similar shield used by his grandfather Warrior Scarlet was published between The Silver Branch and The Lantern Bearers, books two and three in the trilogy that begins with The Eagle of the Ninth. Those excepted, it has been described as 'perhaps (Sutcliff's) finest novel and certainly the most akin to fantasy...as powerful as possible a picture of a putative shamanistic society.' For many years, Sutcliff lived in the village of Walberton, next to the South Downs that feature in her writing; Warrior Scarlet and her 1960 novel Knights Fee take place in the same geographical location, while the central character in Eagle of the Ninth also receives a land grant on the Downs. There are several explicit connections made between the two books; in Knights Fee, the hero Randall also helps guard sheep on the Downs and is shown an axe head made for someone 'left-handed or one-handed.' Warrior Scarlet is the earliest of Sutcliff's 'Celtic' novels and the theme of sacrifice that appears elsewhere is here touched on only briefly. However, it does contain another common theme, that of different peoples occupying the same land and joining together over time. Drem's tribe are the 'Golden People,' who took the land and subjugated its original owners or 'Little Dark People,' but the shepherd Doli tells him his people were previously conquered by another tribe of 'red-gold giants', before ultimately becoming one. In the book, a travelling peddler shows his hosts an iron dagger, presaging the end of the Bronze Age and beginning of the Iron Age; like their predecessors, the dominance of Drem's own people will pass. When she was two years old, Sutcliff contracted Still's disease, a form of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, which left her paralysed and wheelchair-bound for much of her life. Many of her books portray a sense of being separate; its attribution to a physical handicap appears in Warrior Scarlet, as well as her later works The Witches Brat and The Flowers of Adonis. Rudyard Kipling, who lived on the other side of the Downs near Burwash in East Sussex, was a major influence on Sutcliff, as she herself acknowledged. In Warrior Scarlet, the Little Dark People are also referred to as the 'Flint People,' linking it to two stories in Kipling's 1910 collection Rewards and Fairies; these are \\"The Knife and the Naked Chalk\\" and \\"Song of the Men's Side.\\" Warrior Scarlet was runner-up for the 1958 Carnegie Medal, an award Sutcliff finally won in 1959 for The Lantern Bearers.

After the Roman conquest of Hispania the Paleohispanic languages, with the exception of Proto-Basque, were replaced by Latin, the ancestor of the modern Iberian Romance languages. Languages Some of these languages were documented directly through inscriptions, mainly in Paleohispanic scripts, that date for sure between the 5th century BC, maybe from the 7th century in the opinion of some researchers, until the end of the 1st century BC or the beginning of the 1st century AD. * Vasconic languages  Proto-Basque ‚Äî Unattested, partially reconstructed through internal analysis of modern Basque. Proto-Basque is also the ancestor or sibling of the Aquitanian language (see below).  Aquitanian ‚Äî Close relative of modern Basque. Some scholars characterise Aquitanian as an ancestor of Basque, while others describe Aquitanian and Basque as siblings both descended from Proto-Basque. * Unclassified languages  Iberian ‚Äî Shares many obvious similarities with the Vasconic languages. However, lack of data has thus far prevented scholars from determining whether these similarities arose from convergence due to intense contact, or whether Iberian does in fact possess a genetic relationship to the Vasconic languages.  Tartessian ‚Äî Scholarly opinion places Tartessian definitely outside of the Indo-European family, but further classification remains uncertain. Tartessian seems to have borrowed many place names from some Celtic and/or other Indo-European languages; but its syllable structure is totally incompatible with the phonology of any Indo-European language, and much more compatible with the phonology of the Vasconic languages and Iberian. Despite this phonological compatibility, a lack of data has thus far made it impossible to clarify any relationship with the Vasconic languages or Iberian. * Indo-European languages  Celtic languages * Celtiberian * Gallaecian  (Internally unclassified languages) * Lusitanian ‚Äî Definitely an Indo-European language. Possibly Celtic or Italic, but a lack of data has prevented scholars from determining exactly where Lusitanian fits within the Indo-European family. * Sorothaptic ‚Äî Scarcely attested Indo-European language known only from loanwords associated with the 1000 BC Urnfield culture, presumed to be Pre-Celtic. Lack of data makes it impossible to determine exactly where Sorothaptic fits within the Indo-European family. Other Paleohispanic languages can only be identified indirectly through toponyms, anthroponyms or theonyms cited by Roman and Greek sources. Classification Of these languages, Celtiberian, Gallaecian, Lusitanian, and presumably Sorothaptic were Indo-European languages; Celtiberian and Gallaecian were Celtic languages, and Lusitanian may also have been, but the hypothetical Sorothaptic was not. Aquitanian was a precursor of Basque, while Tartessian and Iberian remain unclassified.

Career Kent was born in Inverness, Sunflower County, Mississippi. Although he had played the bass guitar in Chicago's clubs since the 1950s, Kent worked full-time in careers other than music until he was over 50 years of age. Following heart surgery, he stopped work as a truck driver, and formed a band. In 1971, Kent took up residence at Ma Bea's Lounge in West Madison, Chicago. The house band became known as Sugar Bear and the Beehives, headed by Kent (the Sugar Bear) with guitarist Willie James Lyons and drummer Robert Plunkett. For the next six years, this troupe backed visiting musicians, such as Fenton Robinson, Hubert Sumlin, Eddy Clearwater, Jimmy Johnson, Carey Bell, Buster Benton, John Littlejohn, Casey Jones, and Mighty Joe Young. The house band's proficient playing led to their recording a live album in October 1975 at Ma Bea's, billed as Ghetto. Kent continued to play live shows, even after being diagnosed with colon cancer in early 2005. He died in Englewood, Illinois in March 2006.

Domestic cricket The highlight of the decade was the establishment of the famous Sheffield Shield to be contested as a national championship by Australian colonial sides from the 1892‚Äì93 season.

A highly qualified scientist, General Neethling was alleged to have used police forensic laboratories for the production of poisons to kill anti-apartheid activists, and to have developed chemical and biological weapons for use against the black population in South Africa.Police General should be charged with murder He died of lung cancer in Pretoria, aged 69. War orphan In 1948, Afrikaners who were supporters of defeated Nazi Germany in World War II came up with a plan to adopt as many as 10,000 war orphans, in light of the horrendous circumstances they endured after the war. In the event, the German Children's Fund (GCF) managed to finance a group of only 83 orphans who arrived in Cape Town in September 1948. One of them was 13-year-old Lothar Paul Tietz, who was adopted by the GCF chairman, Dr J C Neethling. In turn Lothar Neethling, cutting his ties with Germany soon after his arrival, adopted South Africa as his \\"new fatherland\\".The nazi secret of the 83rd orphan He excelled academically and, having absorbed all the elements of the Boer culture in his teenage years, was fully accepted into the Afrikaner community. Newspaper reporter Max du Preez claimed Neethling described himself as a \\"staunch Christian.\\" Scientist Lothar Neethling gained two doctorates in chemistry, one of which was from the University of California. He was a prominent member of the Afrikaans Academy of Arts and Science, which awarded him its gold medal. More widely, he was regarded as a brilliant scientist and was honoured by a number of international scientific organisations as well as receiving a medal from the government of Taiwan. Police officer In 1971, Neethling founded the South African Police (SAP) forensics unit and in succeeding years was awarded seven SAP medals for forensic work undertaken. By the late 1970s, he had risen rapidly to become SAP's second-in-command, chief deputy commissioner. On 20 October 1986, following Mozambique president Samora Machel's death in an air crash in South Africa, Neethling confiscated the aircraft's flight data and cockpit voice recorders at the scene of the crash. Reportedly on instructions from foreign minister, Pik Botha, he then refused to allow International Civil Aviation Organization and South African Civil Aviation Bureau (CAB) crash investigators access to the flight recorders. CAB director, Rennie van Zyl, had to serve a writ on Botha and Neethling before eventually receiving the two recorders on 11 November 1986. The three-week delay in starting the crash investigation was confirmed by SAP Colonel Des Lynch in evidence to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2001.Special Investigation into the death of President Samora Machel - TRC Report Volume 2 chap.6, para.25 Lothar's potion Three years later, in 1989, Neethling's reputation as a \\"genius chemist\\" became tarnished after revelations by a former commander of the SAP's Vlakplaas death squad, Dirk Coetzee, were published in the anti-apartheid newspaper Vrye Weekblad. Coetzee revealed that Neethling had developed a poison ‚Äî Lothar's potion ‚Äî which Coetzee would collect either from Neethling's home or from his laboratory, and administer to ANC cadres.SA's own bemedalled Dr Mengele is dead The Weekly Mail also covered Coetzee's story. Neethling denied Coetzee's allegations and sued each newspaper R1 million for defamation, but lost the case because the judge, Johann Kriegler, declared him to be an unreliable witness. Neethling was represented by Barry Roux, the lawyer who later defended Oscar Pistorius. Neethling remained in his post, and, with funding by the South African government, appealed against the judgment. The legal costs of the appeal, which took nearly five years, amounted to over R2 million. The Appeal Court found that Judge Kriegler had erred in the lower court, the appeal went in Neethling's favour, and he was awarded R90,000 for defamation. After being ordered to pay Neethling's costs, Vrye Weekblad was forced into bankruptcy and closed in February 1994. The newspaper's editor, Max du Preez, maintained that Neethling had lied in court and, after TRC hearings in September 1997, laid criminal charges of murder, perjury and fraud against him. However, according to du Preez, his charges against Neethling were never thoroughly investigated.Men behind terror squad that killed opponents of the apartheid regime See also *Eugene de Kock *Josef Mengele *Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 air disaster *Craig Williamson * Wouter Basson References Category:Afrikaner people Category:White South African people Category:South African people of Dutch descent Category:South African police officers Category:1935 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:TRC South African testimony ","title":"Lothar Neethling"},{"id":"13894188","text":"Salterbarty Tales is the debut album by the American electronic band Earthstar.

Overview Slabolepszy was born in Bolton, England. His mother was English and his father was a Polish refugee. The family then emigrated to South Africa. He grew up in Musina, Pietersburg and Witbank. Slabolepszy went to a Catholic boarding school, the College of the Little Flower in Polokwane. His initial intention was to become a radio sports commentator. When the school played soccer, he would commentate and record the commentary for later playback. These commentaries soon became an institution. Slabolepszy then extended this to doing sports reports. The local newspaper accepted some of his contributions so he became a published sports journalist when he was 14. Originally intending to pursue a career in radio, he majored in English and Drama at the University of Cape Town. During this period, he saw his first professional theatre and was hooked on the buzz and the sense of immediacy. He then decided to focus on acting. In 1983, Paul received the Standard Bank Young Artist Award. Arguably South Africa's preeminent playwright after Athol Fugard, Slabolepszy is a prolific writer and performer. He was a founder member of The Space Theatre, South Africa's first non-racial theatre company, with Athol Fugard, Yvonne Bryceland and John Kani in 1972. Also a founder member of world-renowned The Market Theatre in Johannesburg, together with Mannie Manim and Barney Simon in 1976. His plays exploit the unease and uncertainty of lower-middle-class white South Africans. He was a longtime friend and collaborator of the late actor Bill Flynn. Slabolepszy has won multiple awards over the years, including every Best Actor award in 1993 for the role of Eddie in his self penned The Return of Elvis Du Pisanie. This play won more awards than any other play in the history of South Africa theatre. These include the 1993 Vita, Fleur du Cap and Dalro Awards, Best New South African Play, Best Actor, Best Production, Best Director ‚Äì as well as The Star Tonight IGI Life Vita Award for Comedy. His plays have been performed internationally.

He financed the colonisation of Barbados, but lost his investment and interest in the islands to the Earl of Carlisle. Birth and upbringing Sir William Courten was the son of William Courten, by his wife Margaret Casiere, and was born in London in 1572. A younger brother, born in 1581, was named Peter. Their father was son of a tailor of Menin and a protestant. After enduring persecution at the hands of the Spaniards, he escaped to England in 1568;Burns 1954, p. 175 his wife, a daughter Margaret, and her husband Michael Boudean accompanied him. The refugees at first set up a manufactory of French hoods in Abchurch Lane, London, but afterwards removed to Pudding Lane, where they traded in silk and linen. The son-in-law, Boudean, soon died, leaving a son Peter, and the daughter married a second husband, John Money, an English merchant. The father and mother apparently lived till the close of Elizabeth's reign. Marriage and trading activities At an early age Courten was sent to Haarlem, as factor to his father's firm, and the younger brother, Peter, went to Cologne. At Haarlem, William married the deaf and dumb daughter of Peter Cromling, a Dutch merchant there, which brought him a dowry of ¬£60,000. About 1600 William returned to London, and Peter remained as his agent in Holland, but paid his brother frequent visits. In 1606 the two brothers entered into partnership with their brother-in-law Money to continue and extend the elder Courten's silk and linen business. William contributed half the capital. In 1619 proceedings were taken in the Star Chamber against Courten, Philip Burlamacchi, and other foreign merchants settled in England, for exporting gold, and a fine of ¬£20,000 was levied on Courten. The firm, Courten & Money, prospered, and it was estimated in 1631 that the capital amounted to ¬£150,000. The prominence of the brothers in the city secured each of them the honour of knighthood. William was knighted 31 May 1622, and Peter 22 February 1622-3. William's operations were not confined to his London business: he built ships and traded to Guinea, Portugal, Spain, and the West Indies. His fleet at one time numbered twenty vessels, with nearly five thousand sailors on board. About 1624 one of his ships discovered an uninhabited island, to which Courten gave the name of Barbadoes. It seems that his agents in Zeeland had suggested to him the expedition. With a view to profiting to the fullest extent by his discovery, he petitioned in 1625 for the grant of all unknown land in the south part of the world, which he called 'Terra Australis Incognita'. In the same year he sent out a few colonists to the islands, and on 25 February 1627-8 received letters-patent formally legalising the colonisation. The grant was addressed to 'the Earl of Pembroke in trust for Sir William Courten'. Courten, in accordance with the deed, began colonisation on a large scale. He sent two ships with 1850 persons on board to Barbadoes, under Captain Powel, who, on his arrival, was nominated governor by Courten and the Earl of Pembroke; but the speculation proved disastrous. Three years later James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, disputed this grant, claiming, under deeds dated 2 July 1627 and 7 April 1628, to be owner of all the Caribbee islands lying between ten and twenty degrees of latitude, (Barbados itself situated at thirteen degrees). In 1629 Carlisle sent two ships, with Henry Hawley as his representative, to take possession of the island. On their arrival they imprisoned Captain Powel, and established Lord Carlisle's authority. The islands remained in Carlisle's hands till 1646, when the lease of them was transferred to Lord Willoughby of Parham. Courten claimed to have lost ¬£44,000 by these transactions, and left his descendants to claim compensation. In many of his speculations Sir Paul Pindar was associated with Courten, and they lent money freely to James I and Charles I. Their joint loans ultimately amounted to ¬£200,000. Failure to obtain any consideration for these heavy loans was the subject of much subsequent litigation. Losses of ships and merchandise sustained at the hands of the Dutch in the East Indies, after the Amboyna massacre, combined with the injustice he suffered in Barbadoes injured Courten's credit at the opening of Charles I's reign. In 1631 the death of his brother Peter, his agent at Middelburg, increased his difficulties. Sir Peter died unmarried, and left his nephew Peter Boudean, who was then settled in Holland, a legacy of ¬£10,000. Boudean had quarrelled with his uncle William, and used every unscrupulous means to injure him. To satisfy his claim on the estate of Sir Peter, Boudean now seized the whole property of the firm of Courten & Money in Holland. The death of Money in 1632 further complicated matters. Courten was one of Money's executors, and Peter Boudean, his stepson, was the other. But the latter declined to administer the estate. Courten at once took action at law to recover his share of the estates of his brother and his partner; the proceedings dragged on long after his death. In spite, however, of these troubles, Courten was still enormously wealthy. In 1628 he paid Charles I ¬£5,000 and received lands in Whittlewood Forest, Northamptonshire. In 1633 he owned land in England, chiefly in Northamptonshire, which produced ¬£6,500. a year, besides possessing a capital of ¬£128,000. His love of maritime enterprise was still vigorous. In the last years of his life he again opened up trade with the East Indies when in 1635 King Charles I granted a trading licence to him under the name of the Courteen association permitting it also to trade with the east at any location in which the East India Company had no presence. He sent two ships (the Dragon and Katherine) to trade with China. The ships never arrived at their destination, and the consequent loss was Courten's deathblow. He died at the end of May or beginning of June 1636, and was buried in the church of St. Andrew Hubbard, Eastcheap. He left many legacies to charitable institutions in his will; but his joint claims with Sir Paul Pindar on the crown, and his claims on his nephew and on Lord Carlisle, were unsettled at the time of his death. Legacy Courten had a son, Peter, by his first wife, who was made a baronet by James I in 1622 (see Courten baronets); married Jane, daughter of Sir John Stanhope, and died without issue early in 1625. He is usually described as of Aldington, Worcestershire. Courten's second wife was a daughter of Moses Tryon, and by her he had a son, William, and three daughters, Hester (wife of Sir Edward Littleton); Mary (wife of Henry Grey, 10th Earl of Kent); Anna (wife (1) of Essex Devereux, heir of the 5th Viscount Hereford and (2) of Sir Richard Knightley). William, the younger, found his father's estate seriously embarrassed by the proceedings of his cousin Peter Boudean, who declined to surrender any of the Dutch property. Complicated litigation continued. Courten married Catharine Egerton, daughter of John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater; and, resolving to carry on his father's business, chartered with his father- in-law's aid, two vessels (Bona Esperanza and Henry Bonaventura) for trade in the East Indies. In this enterprise nearly all his money was invested, and the ships with their cargoes were seized by the Dutch in 1641. The Earl of Bridgewater declined to assist Courten further; the disturbed state of the government rendered any help from that quarter out of the question; and in 1643 bankruptcy followed. Courten's landed estates were alienated to his brother-in-law, the Earl of Kent, and Courten retired to Italy. His wife endeavoured in vain to come to terms with Peter Boudean, and finally joined her husband, who died intestate at Florence in 1655. Two children, William and Katharine, survived him. The former endeavoured to recover some of his father's property, and in 1660 Charles II granted to George Carew, who had been associated in business with Sir William Courten, power to administer the estates of Sir William and his son. Proceedings were also begun in Holland against the Dutch East India Company for compensation for the ships lost in 1641; the English courts of law and parliament were constantly petitioned for redress until the end of the century, but the greater part of the enormous wealth of Sir William Courten never reached his descendants. In August 1660 the privy council heard evidence in support of the claims of Courten's grandson to the ownership of the Barbadoes, but did not deem the proof sufficient. In 1677 petitions to the council and parliament rehearsed the loans of Courten and Sir Paul Pindar to Charles I, but repayment was never ordered. George Carew issued many tracts on the subject, but public interest was not excited. Famed physician and collector Hans Sloane acquired (by bequest, conditional on paying of certain debts) Courten's cabinet of curiosities in 1702 and later donated much of it to the British nation.Sachiko Kusukawa.

Also known as Fort St. Claude and the Yazoo Post, it was established in 1719 and served as the northernmost outpost of French Louisiana. It was destroyed in 1729 by Native Americans and was not rebuilt. Its location, north of Vicksburg on the east bank of the river, was discovered by archaeologists in the 1970s, and was given the Smithsonian trinomial 23-M-5. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2000.Ian W. Brown and Mark R. Barnes (December 19, 1997) , National Park Service and History French Louisiana was established in 1699, with New Orleans founded as a major center in 1718. French explorers of the Yazoo River valley first took place between 1698 and 1706, when French missionaries were active in the area. By then, English traders from the Province of Carolina had already established relations with the Chickasaw people of northern Mississippi, and were making inroads with the Natchez people further south. The missionary activity ceased when one of them was murdered by the Natchez. An expansion of French Louisiana was thwarted by France's inability to support the colony during the War of the Spanish Succession (aka Queen Anne's War in English North America, 1702-1713). The French established Fort St. Pierre in 1719 as a northern outpost between these peoples, as a means to blunt English trading influence and further their own. The fort was a substantial palisaded complex, surrounded by a moat. It was destroyed in a surprise attack on December 11, 1729, by a band of Natchez, whose leadership had become hostile to French incursions on their territory upon the death of a French-friendly chief. The Yazoo Bluffs area, where the fort was located, did not come to significant archaeological attention until the 1970s. James Ford believed that its site would yield useful information for dating other historical Native sites in the region, but did not find the fort. In 1974 a formal survey of the lower Mississippi identified the site, which underwent a major excavation between 1975 and 1977. These excavations exposed portions of the palisade, one of the fort's bastions, and other features. Unique among known colonial sites, archaeologists also uncovered evidence that the occupants used a wooden shot tower to manufacture lead shot. The comparatively short occupation period of Fort St. Pierre has also allowed more sophisticated distinction among finds at sites such as that of Fort Toulouse, which had a much longer occupation period. Indigenous Groups at Fort St. Pierre and Pottery The land around Fort St. Pierre in Vicksburg Mississippi was home to three different native groups, Yazoo, Koroa, Ofogoula, before the French arrived. These groups were friendly with the English and Chickasaw Native tribe, which was contradictory to French interests. Two of these groups, the Yazoo and Koroa were influential in the collapse of Fort St. Pierre. In December 1729, they attacked the fort and killed most of the inhabitants. The third tribe native to this regions, the Ofogoula was not present for the attack. They had relocated to the Natchez region. After the fall of the fort, the Yazoo and Koroa left but continued hostilities towards the French and any indigenous tribe that happened to be fighting with them. Given that these indigenous groups were active on the landscape before and during the French occupation of Fort St. Pierre there is much archaeological evidence pertaining to the Yazoo, Koroa, and Ofogoula. Large amounts of native pottery were found by archaeologists at the site. At Fort St. Pierre, 43% of their archaeological collection is composed of Native ceramic fragments. Those frequently used artifacts, like pottery, tell us what was important to indigenous people of the past and how they lived their lives. Pots and bowls are essentials for cooking, preparing, serving, and storing food. Native women were the primary producers of these clay vessels. Food and Supplies Fort Saint Pierre as a French fort received resupply and reinforcement through land. Uses of Naval support or vessels along the Yazoo River were scarce if ever utilized. Primary food and water resources were acquired via the land surrounding the fort. The soldiers stationed would farm the land and their own food and would seek water through the Yazoo. Outsourced supply or trade was then primarily if not always carried out by land. Life at the fort was relatively simple yet boring, which left little to do save keep watch, farm, and tend the land.

Tuscaloosa, Alabama: University of Alabama Libraries, 2015. Soldiers at the Fort Not many records of the soldiers‚Äô daily lives have been found. But from what we know and from a couple of journal entries we can conclude a few things soldiers experienced during their time at the fort. It is said that the soldiers would go to the chapel to pray twice a day as a part of their duty. The soldiers were given their own plot of land to plant whatever they pleased which is one way they spent their free time. Other forms of leisure activities would include drawing, writing, reading, or spending time with their comrades. We are informed that daily life at the fort was peaceful and usually happy, but with that comes pure boredom. The soldiers‚Äô time was frequently filled with duties such as military drills and maneuvers which kept them on their toes. One problem the soldiers dealt with was a shortage of food and a drought during one summer. They were able to engage in trading with the native tribes around them which in turn helped them out. Artifacts from the Archaeological Excavation of the Fort St. Pierre Site in Vicksburg, MS Featured here: Glass Beads, Pottery and Ceramics, Swivel Guns, Rosary Beads, Musketballs and Lead Shot, Knives, Nails, Buckles, Jetons =Trade: Glass Beads= Photo taken by Kyra McCormick, Becca Leon, and LisaMarie Malischke Drawn beads, also known as cane beads, seed beads, or tube beads, first came to be made in ancient Rome and the technique was then employed in India, Italy, France, and Northwestern Europe. Glass beads were then shipped to North America as a trade item. The specific bead types found at Fort St. Pierre are most likely directly from Venice, Italy. The Venetians were very skilled craftsmen, and they used the same bead making process to create drawn beads as the Romans. The Venetians brought their designs to the Netherlands. Beads were also produced in Paris and London. In addition, beads were traded and shipped to France, which were passed on to explorers, who brought them to the Americas in the early 16th century. When European explorers brought the beads with them, the natives living in the Americas quickly incorporated items like these drawn beads into their own trade and decoration practices. This is how the beads made their way to the fort in Mississippi.Hume, Ivor Noe√å¬àl. A Guide to Artifacts of Colonial America. Vintage Books, 1991.Francis, Peter. The Glass Trade Beads of Europe: Their Manufacture, Their History, and Their Identification. Lapis Route Books, 1988. =Pottery and Ceramics= Photo taken by Kyra McCormick, Becca Leon, and LisaMarie Malischke There are several pottery and ceramic fragments on the site of Fort St. Pierre, many of them being pieces of French Faience. Faience is a form of tin-glazed earthenware that was inspired by imported Chinese porcelain. At the time Faience was considered fairly valuable, but many of the pieces of faience found at Fort St. Pierre are considered to be rejects and misproductions that were sold cheaply to colonists and settlers. Much of the earthenware has been shattered into pieces, possibly due to the destruction of the fort in 1729. Most of the faience in the fort was used for daily life, being used for drinking cups and plates. =Swivel Guns= Photo taken by Kyra McCormick, Becca Leon, and LisaMarie Malischke Swivel guns are smaller naval cannons which can are placed upon a rotating swivel to fire. The presence of swivel guns at Fort Saint Pierre is likely but unknown. The only artifacts unearthed were ammunition which was too large for rifles of the time, and too small for cannons. There is a possibility of the use of wall guns, but this can be discounted as there were no remnants of wall guns at the site. While wall guns stood upon long wooden mounts or rest upon a wall to fire, a swivel gun often utilized two operators and was situated on a rotating swivel. The other artifact discovered is an iron casting which also resembles the time period's iron lanterns. However both of these artifacts were discovered along the river side of the fort and were in relative close distance. Proving further that swivel guns may have been present. While many items are taken into account for determining the use of swivel guns, it is likely that they were present and either removed by a raiding enemy or removed by French forces prior to the fort's demise. =Rosary Beads= Photo taken by Kyra McCormick, Becca Leon, and LisaMarie Malischke It is possible that some of the beads recovered from the remains of the Fort could have been part of a rosary, though they are most likely glass beads intended as items of trade. An archaeological signal of glass rosary beads is when they are recovered linked together by metal loops. Rosary artifacts such as these are recovered at various colonial sites, leading again to the question of where are the rosaries at Fort St. Pierre? If they existed, these items were likely looted, as the looting of religious items from the Jesuit priest at the fort was recorded by French witnesses. Later, Catholic officials paid ransoms to several Native groups to regain the church items, but rosaries were not listed among the returned items. =Musketballs and Lead Shot= Photo taken by Kyra McCormick, Becca Leon, and LisaMarie Malischke Musketballs were recovered at Fort St. Pierre inside structures, palisades, trenches, and the moat. These spherical projectiles made of iron or lead were used both as trade items and as weapons in combat. Musketballs are typically the most common items found at frontier sites, though only a small quantity was found at Fort St. Pierre. The most logical explanation as to their absence is looting after the 1729 attack.Lisamarie Malischke, ‚ÄúHeterogeneity of Early French and Native Forts, Settlements, and Villages: A Comparison to Fort St. Pierre (1719 - 1729) in French Colonial Louisiane‚Äù (University of Alabama, 2015), 14. Shot sizes ranged from smaller bird and buck shot used for hunting birds and game to large musketballs used for trading and warfare. Extra room had to be left between the musketball and the inside of the gun barrel to allow for fouling, or the build-up of black powder after each shot.T.M. Hamilton, Colonial Frontier Guns (Union City, Tennessee: Pioneer Press, 1980), 125-9. The presence of a lead shot drop area indicates French soldiers at Fort St. Pierre made their own small shot. They may have made musketballs, too, since musketballs and firearms were so valuable to life in the colonies.Lisamarie Malischke, ‚ÄúHeterogeneity of Early French and Native Forts, Settlements, and Villages: A Comparison to Fort St. Pierre (1719 - 1729) in French Colonial Louisiane‚Äù (University of Alabama, 2015), 96 In general, lead shot and powder were never scarcities for French colonists. Import of these goods to Louisiane increased from 1.25 tons of lead balls in 1704 to 10 tons in 1733.Hamilton, 129. Archaeologists suggest shot shipped to the colonies was not sorted according to size. Soldiers therefore had to estimate which size shot would work in their barrels, and they sometimes used knives or their own teeth to correct ill-fitting balls.Donald H. Keith and Kiana Smith, ‚ÄúIron and Lead Shot,‚Äù in La Belle: The Archaeology of a Seventeenth-Century Ship of New World Colonization, ed. James E. Bruseth et al., Ed Rachal Foundation Nautical Archaeology Series (College Station: Texas A&M; University Press, 2017), 469. =Knives= Photo taken by Kyra McCormick, Becca Leon, and LisaMarie Malischke Knives, although very basic tools, were essential to the survival of the French Colonists in the New World. This was because knives played a large role in their daily lives, aiding them with hunting, cooking, and trade. Knives were most valuable to the French Colonists when used as trading materials. When first arriving in the new world it was important that the French created a good relationship with the natives of that area. If they did not, it was likely that they would not survive. Pierre Le Moyne d‚ÄôIberville, a French explorer and founder of the colony La Louisiane, understood the importance of maintaining good relations with Indians. As soon as he reached American shores, he attempted to make preliminary contact with the indigenous population in order to facilitate land reconnaissance. When he first made contact, he left the natives with two axes, four knives, and some vermilion to show his good intentions toward two Indians who had been observing them since their arrival. This was the start of a gift system that resulted in the natives becoming dependent on Europeans. Since the natives could not reproduce these knives because they did not know how to create iron and steel tools, they had to be replaced. This opened up trade between the French and the natives. Knives were among the most popular and widespread items of trade in North America. The first known European artifact given to an Indian in Louisiana was a knife presented to a chief of the Natchez by Henri Tonti on March 26, 1682.Brain, Jeffrey P., and T. M. Hamilton. Tunica Treasure. Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, 1979. Clasp knives and case knives were the most common knives in the trade network. These were common because their simple design made them easy to mass-produce. Case knives were often boxed up into cases and shipped over to North America. This allowed the French to trade many knives all at once.Hume, Noel. A Guide To Artifacts of Colonial America. First Vintage Books, 1991. =Nails= Photo taken by Kyra McCormick, Becca Leon, and LisaMarie Malischke One of the most common artifacts found in the French colonial site of Fort St. Pierre are hand wrought nails. Different types of nails were found at this site with the most common being the Rose Head nail, the ‚ÄúL‚Äù Head, ‚ÄúT‚Äù Head, as well as tacks. Hand-wrought nails have different uses and are applied in different scenarios for distinctive materials. For example, the Rose Head was more commonly used for practical uses while the ‚ÄúL‚Äù Head nail was used for furniture. By studying these artifacts, we can better understand the different uses for nails in this French Colonial space.Malischke, Lisamarie. ‚ÄúHeterogeneity of Early French and Native Forts, Settlements, and Villages: A Comparison To Fort St. Pierre (1717-1729) In French Colonial Louisiane .‚Äù The University of Alabama, 2015. =Buckles= Photo taken by Kyra McCormick, Becca Leon, and LisaMarie Malischke Buckles are a common find at Fort St. Pierre and forts alike. Soldiers at the fort used these buckles for many different uses. These include keeping articles of clothing sturdy, tightening straps and harnesses (on both weapons and their rucksacks), and they were used as fashionable accessories on their uniforms. Because of the many uses, buckles during Fort St. Pierre's lifetime ranged greatly in shapes and sizes. Some were larger and more extravagant while others were less flashy and were used more predominantly for their use rather than accessories. Since the fort is a soldier base most of the buckles are plain with minimum designs engraved on them because their usefulness was more valued than their beauty.Baumgarten, Linda.

Book. =Muskets= The 1716 and 1729-1734 model marine muskets were common among the French marines and were likely carried by the men of Fort St. Pierre. While the soldiers were likely the only ones who carried firearms in the fort, similar weaponry was in common use in colonial North America in the 18th century. For example, a smoothbore, flintlock musket hunting gun, called the Fusil de chasse was produced in Tulle, France. Local militiamen and Native groups used these muskets, as they were lightweight and well built. When excavation took place, it was expected that there would be a lot of rifles in the fort, however in comparison to most other forts there were few muskets to be found. It is possible that the cause for the lack of muskets to be found is due to the fort being looted and the remnants of the muskets could be found in locations surrounding Fort St. Pierre.Hamilton, T.

These jetons, though heavily deteriorated, were able to give insight into the possible daily lives of the soldiers stationed at the fort while it was controlled by the French. Jetons often had little to no monetary value outside of French colonial holdings; largely used as a gaming piece or for betting‚Äîsimilar to a modern poker chip. Interestingly, this also could have shown that there was possible interaction between soldiers and natives in the area, as it has been documented that the natives also gambled in similar ways to the soldiers‚Äîhorse races, card games, etc.Brown, I.

Heterogeneity of Early French and Native Forts, Settlements, and Villages: A Comparison to Fort St. Pierre (1719-1729) In French Colonial Louisiane. 2015. Fort's Destruction Following the fire and destruction of Fort St. Pierre in 1729 at the hand of the native people, the fort was abandoned and never rebuilt; a time lasting over 100 years. However, the land did see use again after it was utilized for a Civil War camp for an 18-month stretch between 1862 and 1863, though it is possible that some of the artifacts found during the excavation of the site were from this period. According to Ian W. Brown and Bill Wright, some of the artifacts from the site likely originate from the 1862-1863 period. Among these artifacts are a light turquoise glass container, multiple pieces of leather likely a part of the heel of a shoe, a brass button with an eagle, and a brass gun thumb plate stamped with die.

In Przebra≈ºe, Polish civilians from Volhynia organized defense against the UPA. The village was never conquered by UPAs.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Filar, Przebra≈ºe ‚Äì bastion polskiej samoobrony na Wo≈Çyniu [also in:] Wo≈Çy≈Ñ 1939-1944, Warszawa: ≈öwiatowy ZwiƒÖzek ≈ªo≈Çnierzy Armii Krajowej; Oficyna Wydawnicza \\"Rytm\\", 2007, pp. 73, 77, 93-104. Location The Przebra≈ºe settlement was located south of Troscianiec and north-east of Lutsk, the capital of Polish Volhynia before the Soviet invasion of Poland in agreement with Nazi Germany. The geographic area featured numerous peat bogs and forests. The Konopla river was to the west of the settlement. The population consisted of Poles, who had settled there in the 17th century. They were descendants of several szlachta (Polish nobility) families, that came to Volhynia from Mazowsze. The surrounding villages were inhabited mostly by ethnic Ukrainians. In 1938, Przebra≈ºe had 200 houses and some 1,150 inhabitants. Background In late 1942, Ukrainian nationalists began attacks on Polish settlements in Volhynia (see: Massacres of Poles in Volhynia). Throughout 1943, these incidents moved westwards from one county to another, reaching the area of Kowel in May. The Polish population and the weak Volhynian units of the Polish Home Army were taken by surprise. After the initial shock, however, the Poles started to organize their own units to attack Ukrainians in turn. The Polish 27th Home Army Infantry Division was created out of these units. =Creation= Some time in April 1943, Poles in Przebra≈ºe under former officers 'Harry' Henryk Cybulski and Ludwik Malinowski (a veteran of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War), decided to create a self-defence force, which would help them to resist future Ukrainian attacks. The area in question was vast, with several surrounding smaller settlements, such as Cholopiny, Jazwiny, Mosty and Zagajnik. Sentries were posted, armed with weapons found in the fields after the border battles of the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union and Sten guns made by the Pr≈ºebraze gunsmithery. The regional Armia Krajowa also supplied arms and money so that Poles could buy weapons from corrupt Hungarian soldiers stationed in Volhynia. Two 45mm cannons were salvaged from Soviet tanks that had been destroyed in June 1941 and mounted on carriages. A train driver with AK contacts also delivered arms to the Polish railwaymen at Kiwerce, which were then transported to Przebraze. To avoid clashes with the Germans, a weapon permit from local German authorities in Kiwerce was obtained.After the massacre of the population of Ostrow, a weapons permit was issued by the Kreislandwirt of Kiwerce for 15 captured Russian rifles, which were obtained from the German arsenal According to the memoirs of Henryk Cybulski, the German commander of Kiwerce was bribed with a pig and gold jewelry, after which he signed a document that stated: \\"Hereby authorized inhabitants of the village of Przebra≈ºe are allowed to use weapons to fight forest gangs, which harm [the] interests of the German Reich\\". Polish units in Przebra≈ºe numbered some 500 men, they were divided into four companies and a mounted scouts platoon. In mid-1943 their number grew to 1,000. Reconnaissance patrols would check the surrounding area by day and at night, so that the settlement would not be caught by surprise. A defence line was created around Przebra≈ºe and neighbouring settlements, which consisted of foxholes and barbed wire. The length of barbed wire totalled around and the size of the ‚Äúcamp‚Äù - from east to west and from north to south. =Population in 1943= As news of atrocities spread across Volhynia, up to 28,000 Poles from neighbouring villages and settlements came to Przebra≈ºe. The number of refugees grew day by day; several houses accommodated up to five families, others had to live in temporary mud huts. A field hospital was organized and as skirmishes with Ukrainians were frequent, beds were usually full. In June 1943 Polish units from Przebra≈ºe scouted the area, telling all Poles to leave their houses and move to the fortified settlement. Unfortunately, not all agreed to move and their reluctance later proved to be fatal. Ukrainian UPA attacks At the beginning of the summer of 1943, local Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) commanders suggested that Henryk Cybulski, Ludwik Malinowski and their men should meet and talk. Delegates of both sides met four times, the Poles grew suspicious. Reportedly, the talks were a trap, the Ukrainians wanted to kill Cybulski. Thus, negotiations were terminated. =July 5, 1943 attack= On July 5, 1943, UPA units tried to attack Przebra≈ºe, burning nearby villages and murdering their inhabitants. Shocked refugees would come to the settlement, often only dressed in their underwear. The defence line was then attacked in several places, the battle lasting throughout the night. The next day, July 6, was just as hectic, as Ukrainian units surrounded the settlement and attacked it from all sides. After several hours they gave up, 10 Poles died. As soon as the Ukrainians had left, mounted scouts scoured the area. They counted as many as 550 massacred Poles, those who had refused to move to Pr≈ºebraze. The surrounding villages, such as Majdan Jezierski, Dermanka, Budy, Huta and Dobra, were burned. =Other attacks= A second attack took place on July 12, the UPA concentrated its forces on the village of Rafalowka. The Polish side managed to force the enemy to flee, but this was not the end. As Henryk Cybulski wrote in his memoirs, throughout the summer of 1943 the \\"war for grain\\" persisted. The number of Poles in Przebra≈ºe was too high and its defenders realized that it was impossible to feed so many people. Thus, in April and July 1943, Polish peasants, guarded by patrols, were harvesting crops, transporting it to the settlement. The Ukrainians would attack the peasants, killing several. The last major attack took place on August 31, 1943. Ukrainian forces numbered around 10,000 men, including a 4,000 strong unit from the area of Lviv and 5,000 drafted local peasants, armed with axes and scythes.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Filar, Przebra≈ºe pastion polskiej samoobrony na Wo≈Çyniu, 2007 - pages 90/91, based on the master's thesis of Stefan Chojnecki \\" Samoobrona ludnosc polskiej na Wolyniu w latach 1943-1944\\", Henryk Cybulski, \\" Czerwone noce \\" 1969 - Atak Na Przebraze, pages 255/256 . They worked out a detailed plan of attack (codename \\"Kublo\\"); their headquarters were established in the village of Swozie. Helped by artillery, they attacked from the south. The Przebra≈ºe defenders asked local Home Army units and the Soviet partisan forces of Nikolay Prokopiuk for help, (the latter were numerous in the area and themselves threatened by Ukrainians). They joined the Poles. As a result, the UPA, attacked from the rear, withdrew, losing more than 100 men and abandoning a large quantity of arms. Raids on UPA bases  To prevent attacks on Przebra≈ºe, the self-defence forces conducted counter-attacks on UPA bases situated in villages close to the base, which constantly posed a gravely threat to its security. On 12 July 1943 after the first attack on the base, Henryk Cybulski led 3 companies on a raid on the UPA base in the village of Tro≈õcianiec, which lay 7 km to the north, destroying it and dispersing the UPA garrison.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Filar, Przebra≈ºe bastion polskiej samoobrony na Wo≈Çyniu, pages 73-74 On 2 August 1943 a raid destroyed the UPA base at Jaromla, which lay 5 km to the north east.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Filar, Przebra≈ºe bastion polskiej samoobrony na Wo≈Çyniu, page 77. At the end of September, 1943 a 100-man unit from Przebra≈ºe, with the soldiers of the Rafa≈Ç√≥wka and Komar√≥wek self- defences, conducted a joint counter-attack which destroyed the UPA base at Hauczyce, 8 km south of Przebra≈ºe, eliminating a constant threat to Rafa≈Ç√≥wka. A raid against the UPA NCO training school in Omelno on 5 October 1943 was carried out as a joint operation with colonel‚Äôs Prokopiuk unit. Taking part in it were 300 Polish troops and 150 Soviet partisans, against 200 UPA troops, including 120 UPA students at the school. The school was destroyed, but UPA lost over 10 men only. A similar action was undertaken on the night of 27/8 October 1943 when a joint party with Prokopiuk‚Äôs partisans attacked S≈Çowatycz. UPA losses were several dozen men. A 100 Uzbek deserters from the German Army, who were serving in the UPA forces were taken prisoner and went over to the Soviet partisans. A raid against UPA was undertaken around ≈ªurawicz on 26 November 1943. It had a significant impact on the supply of provisions for Przebra≈ºe. After obtaining reconnaissance reports that Ukrainian nationalists in ≈ªurawicz held over 1,000 requisitioned cattle, a large force of about 740 defenders of Przebra≈ºe struck the village, seizing the cattle and large quantities of flour and grain. On 31 December 1943 after receiving intelligence information about the upcoming attack on Przebra≈ºe, the same unit ambushed a large force of UPA troops moving south on the road to Przebra≈ºe. Taken by surprise the UPA troops fled in disorder suffering many losses. Aftermath In February 1944, Volhynia was occupied by the Red Army. As the UPA was considered an enemy of the Soviet regime, the Soviet military forces put a stop to the attacks by the UPA. In 1945 Poles from this part of Volhynia were forced by Soviet authorities to move to the area of Niemodlin, in Opole Voivodeship, the land that had belonged to Germany before the war. In 2004 Ukrainian authorities cleaned the Polish cemetery. A victory flag, woven by women from Przebra≈ºe in September 1943, can be seen in the Museum of the Polish Army in Warsaw.

Thonner's German plant key of 1891 was translated into English for the second time in 1981, and became more accessible to English-speaking botanists, rivalling that of John Hutchinson and Families of Angiosperms by Bertel Hansen & Knud Rahn (1969). The key covers gymnosperms and angiosperms and was designed for field use. Thonner also used back-up features ensuring correct choice of the family even when there is uncertainty about classifying botanical structures.

The organization directly supports more than 150 elementary school students, more than 150 high school students, and about 25 college and university students. Friends of Kakamega, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization based in Freeport, Maine, was founded in 2003 and raises funds and organizes sponsorships to support these children and youth in Kakamega, Kenya. Overview The organization's programs include elementary school sponsorships, high school sponsorships, and college/university sponsorships. About fifty children who face extraordinary challenges at home - or who have no home - spend most of their time living at the Kakamega Orphans Care Center residence, cared for by a loving and committed staff. The Care Centre is not an orphanage, but instead a place where elementary-school age orphans, \\"half-orphans\\" with a surviving parent, and other extremely vulnerable children receive the material necessities and emotional guidance that they need to thrive in school and develop fully. During school breaks most Care Centre children return to their homes and stay with their guardians (typically an aunt, grandmother, or single mother); those without safe homes to return to stay with the women who founded and manage the project. In the same age group, more than 100 elementary school children are supported by the Homebased sponsorship program, living in loving homes with extremely needy aunts, uncles, grandmothers, and single mothers. In the Homebased program, guardians receive a small cash stipend, farm inputs, and a few basic needs that help improve the sponsored child's wellbeing at home and in school. The High School sponsorship program continues support for the students who graduated 8th grade, providing school fees, uniforms, books and supplies, pocket money, and other essentials - as well as guidance and support - to more than 150 high school students. The College & University program supports more than 25 students and is proud to already have over 10 diploma- and degree- holding graduates. The majority of funding for KOCC comes from donors in the United States and Canada, through the Friends of Kakamega. However, local Kenyans also do their best to support the project financially or in kind. History The project was started in 2002, when Dorothy Selebwa from Kakamega visited the Northeast of the United States. Focusing especially on Quaker meetinghouses, her fundraising tour brought the plight of Kenya's needy children and AIDS orphans to the attention of many Quakers. Several Maine women, including Sukie Rice, Molly Duplisea-Palmer, and Sharon Salmon, decided to start a fundraising organization to support the feeding program. Soon, Friends of Kakamega planned a dining hall, and later a dormitory-style Care Center. In 2004, the dining hall was opened, and by 2005 the dorms were completed and full of children. Support for children in their family homes, through the Homebased Program, was introduced shortly afterward. As students graduated 8th grade and moved on in school, the High School program was born. Similarly, the college & university program was introduced after the first students graduated from high school, and today there are already more than 10 college & university graduates and more than 25 current college & university students.McCarthy, Jim \\"Compassion in Action\\", The Times Record, October 13, 2005 References External links *Friends of Kakamega home page Category:Non-profit organizations based in Maine Category:Charities based in Kenya Category:Kakamega ","title":"Kakamega Orphan Project"},{"id":"13894344","text":"John Brownlee Lonsdale, 1st Baron Armaghdale (23 March 1850 ‚Äì 8 June 1924), known as Sir John Lonsdale, Bt, between 1911 and 1918, was a British businessman and Conservative politician.  Early life  Born at The Pavilion, in the cathedral city of Armagh, Lonsdale was the son of James Lonsdale DL, JP (1826‚Äì1913) and Jane Brownlee, and was educated privately. He was a partner in the family firm of J. and J. Lonsdale & Company.  Business and political career  Lonsdale was a director of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Bank and of the North of England Debenture Company, chairman of Levenstein Ltd and vice-chairman of the Manchester Ship Canal Warehousing Company. In 1895 he was appointed High Sheriff of Armagh, succeeding William Maynard Sinton. He was elected a Member of Parliament for Mid-Armagh in a by- election in February 1900, and sat until 1918. During his time in parliament, he acted as a whip for the Irish Unionist Party in the House of Commons for 15 years, and was a strong opponent of Home Rule. He was created a baronet, of Prince's Gardens in the Royal Borough of Kensington and of The Pavilion in the City and County of Armagh, on 7 July 1911, and raised to the peerage as Baron Armaghdale, of Armagh in the County of Armagh, on 17 January 1918. Between 1920 and 1924 he was Lord Lieutenant of Armagh. Lonsdale was hostile to the Irish language in his political life. Retrieved on 7 April 2018. On 25 July 1906, the sitting Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, John Hamilton-Gordon, had to write to the Intermediate Board (the organisation through which public education policy was implemented), to see that progress was made, due to the frustration of Irish language education provision by those who controlled it. In response, Lonsdale, while sitting as MP for Mid Armagh and member of the Ulster Unionist Council, claimed that the Gaelic movement which supported the Irish language was simply inspired by hatred of England and all things English. He opposed any teaching of Irish in primary schools as \\"money wasted\\" and \\"useless\\" as well as claiming that Irish was a vehicle for the dissemination of \\"seditious views.\\"  Personal life  Lord Armaghdale married Florence Rumney, of Stubbins House, Lancashire. They had no children. The Armaghdales lived in England at The Dunes, Sandwich Bay, and kept a London house at Prince's Gardens, SW7. A keen golfer, Lord Armaghdale presented the Lonsdale Cup to the County Armagh Golf Club.County Armagh Golf Club He died in London on 8 June 1924, aged 74, when the baronetcy and barony became extinct. Lady Armaghdale died in London in 1937.  Memorials  = In steam =  First locomotive  The Lady Armaghdale is the name of a steam locomotive on public display in the Engine House at Highley in Shropshire on the Severn Valley Railway. This is not the first steam engine to carry this name. The first was purchased by Levenstein Ltd in 1920 from the manufacturer Hawthorne Leslie and located at the Blackley dyestuffs works in Manchester. In those days it was common to name steam locomotives serving industry and this one was named after the Chairman's wife. The locomotive remained in use at the Blackley works until early in 1963 when there was an accident and it could not be repaired.  Second locomotive  In 1963 the nearby Manchester Ship Canal Railway was taking steam locomotives out of service but the company (then ICI) purchased a replacement from the Ship Canal. Although this replacement was 22 years older (Hunslet Engine Co 1898) it had recently been refurbished. The replacement locomotive was repainted in a vivid cherry red and the Lady Armaghdale nameplates were fixed to the water tanks. It was used until 1968 when rail traffic was transferred to road. The locomotive was sold to the Warwickshire Industrial Locomotive Preservation Group who transferred it to the Severn Valley Railway. = At Armagh = St. Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh, created by James Humphries Hogan of James Powell and Sons A memorial stained glass was donated by his wife which was installed in the west-most window of the south aisle in St. Patrick's Cathedral, depicting Saints George, John, and Patrick.

Oregon, 548 U.S. 331 (2006), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a state court did not have to exclude evidence that was admitted into court in violation of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  Background  Moises Sanchez-Llamas, a national of Mexico, was convicted of attempted murder in Oregon after engaging police in an armed confrontation. Mario Bustillo, a national of Honduras, was convicted of murder in Virginia for beating a man to death with a baseball bat. Neither man had his consulate informed of the charges against him, as is required by Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Both Sanchez-Llamas and Bustillo filed state habeas petitions in their respective cases arguing that their right to consular notification had been violated. In both Oregon and Virginia, the courts ruled that because the claims were not argued at the trial court level they were procedurally barred. The supreme courts of Oregon and Virginia both upheld the states' procedural bars. The two cases were then consolidated and argued before the United States Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court held that states could admit evidence against defendants even if the evidence was obtained in violation of the Vienna Convention.The Supreme Court, 2005 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 303 (2006). The Court reasoned that the exclusionary rule is idiosyncratic to American jurisprudence and so could not have been in contemplation by other nation-states when they ratified the Vienna Convention. The Court also held that Article 36 claims not timely brought could be procedurally barred by state procedural default rules. However, the Supreme Court was unwilling to rule whether or not Article 36 created individual rights that had to be honored in state criminal proceedings.  See also  * Breard v.

Additionally, ill- defined but commercially important \\"basic chromium sulfates\\" are known. These salts are usually either violet or green solids that are soluble in water. It is commonly used in tanning leather. Chromium(III) sulfates Three chromium(III) sulfates are well characterized: *Anhydrous chromium(III) sulfate, Cr2(SO4)3, (CAS #10101-53-8) is a violet solid that dissolves in water upon addition of a reducing agent, which generates chromium(II) sulfates. *Hydrated chromium(III) sulfate, Cr2(SO4)3¬∑18H2O, (CAS #13520-66-6) is a violet solid that readily dissolves in water to give the metal aquo complex, [Cr(H2O)6]3+. The formula of this compound can be written more descriptively as [Cr(H2O)6]2(SO4)3¬∑6H2O. Six of the eighteen water molecules in this formula unit are water of crystallization. *Hydrated chromium(III) sulfate, Cr2(SO4)3¬∑15(H2O), (CAS #10031-37-5) is a green solid that also readily dissolves in water. It is obtained by heating the 18-hydrate material above 70 ¬∞C. Further heating yields the anhydrous sulfate. A variety of other chromium(VI) sulfates are known, but also contain hydroxide or oxide ligands. Most important commercially is basic chromium sulfate, which is thought to be [Cr2(H2O)6(OH)4]SO4 (CAS#39380-78-4).Covington, A. D.; Lampard, G. S.; Menderes, O.; Chadwick, A.

It results from the partial neutralization of the hexahydrates. Other chromium(III) hydroxides have been reported. Structure of Cr(SO4)(H2O)(OH), showing the CrO6 coordination sphere typical of many chromium(III) compounds. Production The most useful source of chromium(III) sulfate are the Cr(III) wastes from the chromate oxidation of various organic compounds. Anthroquinone and quinone are produced on large scale by treatment of anthracene and phenol with chromic acid. A chromium(III) oxide coproduct is generated which is readily extracted into sulfuric acid. Evaporation of these acidic solutions affords the hydrate salt described above. The hydrated salts of chromium sulfate can also be produced, albeit impure, by extraction of various other chromium compounds, but these routes are not economically viable.. Extraction of chromite ore with sulfuric acid in the presence of some chromate gives solutions of chromium(III) sulfate contaminated with other metal ions. Similarly, dissolution of chrome alloys gives chromium sulfate together with ferrous sulfate. =Basic chromium(III) sulfate= Basic chromium sulfate is produced from chromate salts by reduction with sulfur dioxide, although other methods exist. The reduction could formally be written: :Na2Cr2O7 \\\\+ 3 SO2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí Cr2(SO4)3 \\\\+ 2 NaOH Since 33% of the anion charges are due to hydroxy ions the basicity is 33% (but in tanning jargon it is known as 33% reduced). Products with higher basicities, e.g. 42% or 50% may be obtained by the addition of sodium carbonate, these are often used in combination with sodium formate. The sodium sulfate is often left in the technical product since it is inert with respect to the tanning process. It is important to fully reduce the hexavalent chromium to trivalent since the hexavalent is more likely to cause health problems for tanners and leather consumers.

This flattened, oval shell is an ear-shaped spiral with a mottled outer surface. At the bottom margin of the shell, there is a curving row of five to seven slightly raised respiratory apertures, through which the mantle extends with short, exhalant siphons.

Any breach of these laws is a criminal offence which can lead to a fine of up to ¬£5,000 or six months in prison. The demand for ormers is such that they led to the world's first underwater arrest, when a Mr. Kempthorne-Leigh of Guernsey was illegally diving for ormers, and was arrested by a police officer in full diving gear.

Beginnings In the winter of 1840, the Western Emigration Society was founded in Missouri, with 500 pledging to trek west into Mexico California. Members included Baldridge, Barnett, Bartleson, Bidwell and Nye. Organized on 18 May 1841, Talbot H. Green was elected president, John Bidwell secretary, and John Bartleson captain. The group joined Father Pierre Jean De Smet's Jesuit missionary group, led by Thomas F. Fitzpatrick, westward across South Pass along the Oregon Trail. That trail took them past Courthouse and Jail Rocks, Chimney Rock, Scotts Bluff, Fort Laramie, and Independence Rock. The Bartleson-Bidwell party separated from Fitzpatrick, and the missionary group, at Soda Springs on 11 Aug. The Trail The western Emigration Society had resolved to follow the route suggested by Dr. John Marsh. As early as 1837, Marsh realized that owning a great rancho was problematic if he could not hold it. The corrupt and unpredictable rulings by courts in California (then part of Mexico) made this questionable. With evidence that the Russians, French and English were preparing to seize the province, he determined to make it a part of the United States. He felt that the best way to go about this was to encourage emigration by Americans to California, and in this way the history of Texas would be repeated.Lyman, George D.

That route led southwest from Soda Springs along the Bear River and the Cache Valley. On 24 Aug., the party headed west and north around the Great Salt Lake, camping in the vicinity of the Hansel Mountains until 9 Sept., while they scouted the route to Mary's River.

The Union victory secured that beachhead and paved the way for the eventual fall of Vicksburg. A area surrounding part of the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and a larger area was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005.

The Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the Port Gibson battlefield. American Battlefield Trust \\"Saved Land\\" webpage. Accessed May 23, 2018. Description The battlefield area is about west of Port Gibson. The terrain is a tangle of ravines and terraces, caused by the soil type (sedimentary loess) and a history of intensive agricultural use up to the 20th century. The area is now largely wooded, with a scattering of non-historic houses and other buildings, mainly along Rodney Road which roughly bisects the battlefield. The only surviving historic structure is the Shaifer plantation house, which is where the battle began. At the time of the battle in 1863, the terraces of the area would have been in agriculture, with the ravines filled with dense jungle-like growth. After a number of failed attempts to reach Vicksburg from the north and northeast, Union General Ulysses S. Grant decided to march his army down the west side of the Mississippi River, past Vicksburg, and locate a crossing area from which he could reach the city from the south. A crossing point at Bruinsburg, just south of the mouth of Bayou Pierre, was described as suitable for the army's use, and on April 30, 1863 Grant began what was then one of the largest amphibious military operations in United States history. The initial landing was unopposed, and Grant moved quickly to secure the beachhead, moving troops up the road toward Port Gibson. These met with Confederate defenders under the command of General John S. Bowen at the Shaifer plantation on May 1, with the Union forces victorious in a daylong bloody battle. The victory was key in setting the foundation for Grant's successful conclusion to the Vicksburg Campaign. The surviving Shaifer plantation house is now owned by the state.

The boundaries of Putnoe are approximately Mowsbury Park and golf course to the north, Church Lane and Haylands Way to the east, Polhill Avenue to the south, with Kimbolton Road to the west. Part of the area is also known as Woodside. History Putnoe was listed in the Domesday Book: Putenehou: Hugh de Beauchamp. Mill. The name in its present form has been around since the 16th century, but was formerly known as Puttenhoe and Putenho indicating the spur or \\"hoh\\" of land belonging to an unknown Anglo-Saxon settler Putta. The original farmstead may have been on the same site as Putnoe Farm which is now occupied by Puttenhoe Elderly Person's Home, next to Putnoe Street. The area remained undeveloped farmland until after World War II . At this time momentum grew in Bedford to plan the re-development of the town from its population of 58,000 to 75,000. This required the provision of a substantial area of land for housing development. The decision to develop the Putnoe area was taken in 1950, and the first phase of construction of the Putnoe estate occurred between 1953 and 1957. Governance Putnoe is an unparished area, with all community services under the direct control of Bedford Borough Council. Putnoe elects two councillors to Bedford Borough Council, both of whom are currently Liberal Democrats. Economy Putnoe is almost entirely residential, there are no major industrial or business estates in the area. Most shops and services are clustered around a shopping parade called Library Walk as a public library is situated here, located on Putnoe Street. A One Stop supermarket, a bakery and cafe, a butcher's, an optician's, a newsagents and post office, a pub named The Bluebell, and an Elderly Persons Home called 'Puttenhoe' are all located here.

The converse relationship, the relationship from the niece or nephew's perspective, is that of an aunt or uncle. A niece is female, while a nephew is male, with the term nibling used in place of the gender specific niece and nephew in some specialist literature. As aunt/uncle and niece/nephew are separated by two generations they are an example of second-degree relationship and are 25% related.  Lexicology  The word nephew is derived from the French word neveu which is derived from the Latin nepotem. The term nepotism, meaning familial loyalty, is derived from this Latin term. Niece entered Middle English from the Old French word nece, which also derives from Latin nepotem. The word nibling is a neologism suggested by Samuel Martin in 1951 as a cover term for \\"nephew or niece\\"; it is not common outside of specialist literature. Sometimes in discussions involving analytic material or in abstract literature, terms such as male nibling and female nibling are preferred to describe nephews and nieces respectively.Keen, Ian. \\"Definitions of kin.\\" Journal of Anthropological Research 41.1 (1985): 62-90. Terms such as nibling are also sometimes viewed as a gender-neutral alternative to terms which may be viewed as perpetuating the overgenderization of the English language.Hill, Jane H., and Kenneth C. Hill. \\"Culture Influencing Language: Plurals of Hopi Kin Terms in Comparative Uto‚ÄêAztecan Perspective.\\" Journal of linguistic Anthropology 7.2 (1997): 166-180. These French-derived terms displaced the Middle English nyfte, nift, nifte, from Old English nift, from Proto-Germanic *niftiz (‚Äúniece‚Äù); and the Middle English neve, neave, from Old English nefa, from Proto-Germanic *nef√¥ (‚Äúnephew‚Äù).  Culture  Traditionally, a nephew was the logical recipient of his uncle's inheritance if the latter did not have a successor. A nephew might have more rights of inheritance than the uncle's daughter. In social environments that lacked a stable home or environments such as refugee situations, uncles and fathers would equally be assigned responsibility for their sons and nephews. Among parents, some cultures have assigned equal status in their social status to daughters and nieces. This is, for instance, the case in Indian communities in Mauritius, and the Thai Nakhon Phanom Province, where the transfer of cultural knowledge such as weaving was distributed equally among daughters, nieces and nieces-in- law by the Tai So community, and some Garifuna people that would transmit languages to their nieces. In some proselytizing communities the term niece was informally extended to include non-related younger female community members as a form of endearment. Among some tribes in Manus Province of Papua New Guinea, women's roles as sisters, daughters and nieces may have taken precedence over their marital status in social importance. Additional terms * A grandnephew or grandniece is the grandson or granddaughter of one's sibling. Also called great-nephew / great-niece. * A niece-in-law or nephew-in-law is the spouse of one's nephew/niece, or the niece of one's spouse. * A co-niece-in-law or co-nephew-in-law is the spouse of one's niece- in-law or nephew-in-law. * A sororal niece or sororal nephew is the child of one's sister. * A fraternal niece or fraternal nephew is the child of one's brother. * A half-niece or half-nephew is the child of one's half-sibling, related by 12.5%. In some cultures and family traditions, it is common to refer to cousins with one or more removals to a newer generation using some form of the word niece or nephew. For more information see cousin. For instance: * A niece or nephew sometimes refers to a first cousin once-removed. * A cousin-niece and cousin-nephew or a second niece and second nephew refers to a first cousins once removed. In archaic terminology, a maternal nephew is called a sister-son, emphasizing the importance as a person's nearest male relative should he have no brothers or sons of his own. Sister-son is used to describe some knights who are nephews to King Arthur and is imitated by J. R. R. Tolkien, especially in lists of Kings of Rohan or dwarves where the sister- son is also heir. Sister-daughter is a less common parallel term for niece.  References   External links   * Dictionary.com, \\"nephew,\\" in Dictionary.com Unabridged. Source location: Random House, Inc.

She is known for the unique amateur bird studies that were published in various periodicals and two books under her pseudonym, Len Howard. Gwendolen Howard was the last of four children born to Henry Newman Howard (1861‚Äì1929), the British poet and dramatist, and Florence Howard, n√©e Warman. Born in the town of Wallington, Howard lived with her family in various homes throughout England and Wales before beginning a music career in London, where she gave music lessons, organized concerts for children of the poor, and played viola in an orchestra under Malcolm Sargent.1901 UK Census (Head: Henry N Howard; District: Ampthill), 1911 UK Census (Head: H Nestman Howard; District: Machynlleth).Ellis, Cynthia. Ideal Home April 1961. In 1938, Howard purchased a plot of land outside the village of Ditchling and arranged for construction of the home she later called \\"Bird Cottage.\\"Property deed (District: Lewes; Purchase: 9 Sept. 1938). Once resident in Bird Cottage, Howard developed an intimate, cohabitational relationship with the wild birds in the area, providing food (including her own war rations), chasing away predators, tending to damaged nests, and allowing the birds to fly and roost throughout her home. Around 1949, Howard began publishing her field notes and \\"bird biographies\\" in British natural history periodicals, and in 1950 her first book was published by Collins Press. Howard continued to write and publish about her birds until at least 1957. Believing that fear is the primary motivating factor in much of avian behaviour as observed by humans, and wanting to combat the scientific conclusions that had been drawn from such observations, Howard strove to effect great control over her and her birds' environment so as to maximize her birds' sense of security, and to encourage an uninhibited relationship with them. To this end, Howard was reclusive and gave strict instructions to those who ventured to visit her or contact her at Bird Cottage. Howard also undertook a public campaign in 1960 to prevent development on the land surrounding her property.Kidd, Andrew. \\"Threat to cottage left to the birds.\\" The Evening Argus 11 April 1973. In her writings, Howard argued that individual intelligence, and not mere instinct, is a factor in much of bird behaviour. Howard paid especial attention to great tits in her studies, although she also wrote about other tits, robins, sparrows, blackbirds, thrushes, and finches, among others, and singled out particularly striking individuals for her biographies. Howard's musical training gave her unique insight into birdsong, and the final section of her first book is devoted to an in-depth analysis of this topic. Gwendolen Howard died on 5 January 1973, at Bird Cottage, at the age of 79.UK Death record (District: Lewes; Registration: 10 Jan 1973). In 2016 a novel based on Len Howard's life and work, 'Het Vogelhuis', written by the Dutch author Eva Meijer, was published in the Netherlands, where it became a best-seller. It has subsequently been translated into several languages. The English translation by Antoinette Fawcett, 'Bird Cottage', was published world-wide by the Pushkin Press on 30 August 2018.

(1788‚Äì1868) was an Irish Presbyterian leader of the early and mid-nineteenth century. Upbringing Henry Cooke came of a family of puritan settlers in County Down from Devonshire. He was the youngest son of John Cooke, tenant farmer of Grillagh, near Maghera, County Londonderry, by his second wife, Jane Howie or Howe, of Scottish descent, and was born on 11 May 1788. From his mother he derived his force of character, his remarkable memory, and his powers of sarcasm. A vivid impression, retained through life, of the events of 1798‚Äîthe Irish Rebellion‚Äîinfluenced his political principles. After struggling for an education in rude country schools, he matriculated at Glasgow College in November 1802. Owing to illness he did not graduate, but he completed the arts and divinity courses, not shining as a student, but taking immense pains to qualify himself as a public speaker. Fresh from Glasgow, he appeared before the Ballymena presbytery in the somewhat unclerical attire of blue coat, drab vest, white cord breeches and tops, proved his orthodoxy on trial, and was licensed to preach. Early career Cooke's first settlement was at Duneane, near Randalstown, County Antrim, where he was ordained on 10 November 1808, though only twenty years of age, as assistant to Robert Scott, with a salary of ¬£25 Irish. Here his evangelical fervour met with no sympathy. On 13 November 1810 he resigned the post, and became tutor in the family of Alexander Brown of Kells, near Ballymena. He speedily received a call from Donegore, County Antrim, and was installed there at Temple-Patrick presbytery, on 22 January 1811. This congregation, vacant since 1808, had chafed under an Arian ministry, and had shown its determination to return to the old paths by rejecting the candidature of Henry Montgomery. Cooke began at Donegore a systematic course of theological study; and by leave of his presbytery he returned, soon after his marriage, to Glasgow, where he spent the winter sessions 1815-16 and 1816‚Äì17, adding chemistry, geology, anatomy, and medicine to his metaphysical studies, and taking lessons in elocution from John M. Vandenhoff. He had been in the habit of giving medical aid to his flock. In 1817-18 he attended classes at Trinity College and the College of Surgeons, Dublin, and walked the hospitals. He was a hard student, but with his studies he combined missionary labours, which resulted in the formation of a congregation at Carlow. Shortly after his return from Dublin, Cooke was called to Killyleagh, county Down, and resigning Donegore on 6 July 1818, he was installed at Killyleagh, at Dromore presbytery on 8 September. The lord of the manor, and the leading Presbyterian at Killyleagh, was Archibald Hamilton Rowan. Rowan's younger son, Captain Rowan, an elder of Killyleagh, was attached to the older theology, and secured the election of Cooke, who was allowed to be 'by no means bigoted in his opinions'. In fact, while at Donegore he had been 'led to join in Arian ordinations', a laxity which at a later period he sincerely lamented. In 1821 English Unitarians sent John Smethurst of Moreton Hampstead, Devon, on a preaching mission in Ulster. Favoured by Rowan (the father) he came to Killyleagh, where Cooke and the younger Rowan confronted him at his lecture in a schoolroom. Wherever Smethurst went Cooke was at hand with a reply, inflicting upon the Unitarian mission a series of defeats from which it never recovered. In opposing, later in the same year, the election of the Arian William Bruce to the chair of Hebrew and classics in the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, Cooke was unsuccessful, and he was discouraged by the result of his appeal on the subject to the following synod (at Newry, 1822). He preached in the spring of 1824 as a candidate for First Armagh, but was not chosen. Division in synod Cooke gave evidence before the Royal Commission on education in Ireland in January 1824; and before committees of both houses of parliament in April on the religious bearings of the Irish education question. He described the Belfast Academical Institution as \\"a seminary of Arianism\\". He claimed that among the Protestants of the north of Ireland there was increased opposition to Catholic emancipation; he warned against undue concessions to Catholics. The publication of his evidence produced a furore, and he reacted by rallying Protestant sentiment in Ulster to his call. Cooke was then elected moderator of the General Synod of Ulster at Moneymore in June 1824. This choice began a period of divisive moves. The resolution of synod (June 1825) in his favour, though cautiously worded, was a straw in the wind. At the outset Cooke fought against the odds, if with allies in Robert Stewart of Broughshane, and most of the laity was with him. Among the orthodox ministers an important moderate section, led by James Carlile, looked without favour upon Cooke's policy. The leader of the Arian opposition to Cooke in the synod was Henry Montgomery. The proceedings of the next synod (at Ballymoney, 1826) were not favourable to Cooke, who did not see his way to support a motion for subscription to the Westminster Confession; his proposal that an abridgement of its doctrines should be drawn up as a standard of orthodoxy was turned down. Then in the three succeeding synods, at Strabane (1827), Cookstown (1828), and Lurgan (1829), Cooke carried all before him. By exacting from all members of synod a declaration of belief in the Trinity, and appointing a select committee for the examination of all candidates for the ministry, he cornered the Arians. Split and aftermath The infighting continued in a complex fashion in 1829 and 1830, around the Academical Institution. There Cooke criticised the appointment of John Ferrie as successor to John Young in the ethics chair. It meant that Cooke had failed to see his own candidate, Carlile, elected; but the rejection of Carlile as candidate for the moral philosophy chair also alienated the moderate party from the Arians. William Cairns of the Institution, himself orthodox, had been close to Young, and a critic of Cooke's line on the Institution. Montgomery picked up on inconsistency in Cooke's view of Ferrie's religious tenets; Cooke dramatised the issue as one of perjury on oath. He lashed out oratorically, and, as reported by William Dool Killen, dominated popular feeling on the personal level, as well as the synod debate. After presenting a \\"remonstrance\\", the Arians seceded. The split meant that 17 ministers with their congregations left the synod, in 1830, led by Montgomery and Fletcher Blakely. Cairns worked to get round a boycott set up by Cooke of Ferrie's teaching, but the effect was to undermine Ferrie. Cooke's de facto expulsion of the Arian leaders was followed up by the enactment of unqualified subscription to the Westminster Confession (9 August 1836), extended to elders 8 April 1840. A union of the General Synod of Ulster with the Secession Synod, under the name General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, occurred on 10 July 1840; the Munster presbytery, formerly nonsubscribing, was incorporated with the assembly in 1854. Cooke was then a strong opponent of the Dissenters' Chapels Act (1844), which secured them in the possession of congregational properties. Belfast ministry and Irish Presbyterianism Cooke's statue in Belfast Cooke's statue in Belfast On 12 October 1828 a unanimous call had been forwarded to Cooke from the congregation of Mary's Abbey, Dublin. But his place was in Belfast, and to there he moved, to a church specially built for him in May Street, and opened 18 October 1829. From this time to the close of his active pastorate in 1867 his fame as a preacher drew crowds to May Street. The calls upon his pulpit services elsewhere were not infrequent; hence the story, told by Classon Porter, that 'his people once memorialled their presbytery for an occasional hearing of their own minister'. Established in Belfast, he became not merely the presiding spirit of Irish Presbyterianism (he was elected moderator of assembly in 1841 and 1862), but the leader and framer of a Protestant party in the politics of Ulster. To this consummation his wishes tended, when he purged the synod. The political principles of the Arian chiefs were as dangerous in his estimation as their lax theological notions. Till the election of 1832 Belfast had been a stronghold of liberalism. Cooke turned the tide. So completely did his work transform the relations of parties that even Montgomery, in later life, dropped his political liberalism. At the Hillsborough meeting (30 October 1834) Cooke, in the presence of forty thousand people, published the banns of a marriage between the established and Presbyterian churches of Ireland. The alliance was to be politico-religious, not ecclesiastical, a union for conserving the interests of Protestantism against the political combination of the Roman catholic, 'the Socinian, and the infidel'. Still more thoroughly did he succeed in his political mission by his dealing with O'Connell's visit to Belfast in January 1841. Cooke's challenge to a public discussion of facts and principles was evaded by O'Connell. The anti-repeal meeting which followed O'Connell's abortive demonstration was famed in Ulster. Almost his last platform appearance was at Hillsborough on 30 October 1867, when, in his eightieth year, Cooke spoke against the threatened disestablishment of Protestantism in Ireland. On 5 March 1868 he attended the inaugural meeting of an Ulster Protestant defence association. In the same sense was the address (24 October 1868) to the Protestant electors of Ireland, penned almost on his deathbed. Cooke's Presbyterianism was of the most robust type; he would not rank himself as a 'dissenter', claiming to be a minister of 'a branch of the church of Scotland'. But he was anxious to support the establishment of Protestant Christianity as 'the law of the empire'. When, in 1843, the general assembly of his church passed a resolution recommending its members to secure the return of Presbyterian representatives to parliament, Cooke formally withdrew from the assembly, and did not return to it until 1847, when the resolution was rescinded. In the non-intrusion controversy which divided the church of Scotland Cooke used all his influence with the government to obtain concessions satisfactory to the liberties of the church, and on the day of the disruption (18 May 1843) gave the encouragement of his presence and voice to the founders of the Free church. Irish national education The question of education, especially in its religious bearings, engaged Cooke at an early period. When the scheme for Irish national education was started in October 1831, Cooke at once scented danger to the Protestant interest. After many negotiations the synod in 1834 broke off relations with the education board. Cooke explained the views of the synod to the parliamentary committees of inquiry in 1837. In 1839 the synod, under Cooke's guidance, organised an education scheme of its own, and applied to the government for pecuniary aid. The result was that the synod's schools were recognised by the board in 1840 on Cooke's own terms. In September 1844 the general assembly made application to the government for the erection of a college which should provide a full course of education for students for the ministry under the assembly's superintendence and control. The government, however, established the Queen's College on 30 December 1846, but endowed four chairs in a theological college at Belfast under the assembly (and two chairs in connection with the non- subscribing Presbyterians). It was expected that Cooke would be the first president of the Queen's College; this office was conferred instead on the Rev. Pooley Shuldman Henry; to Cooke was given the agency for the distribution of Regium Donum, a post worth ¬£320 per annum, and on the opening of the Queen's College in 1849 he was appointed Presbyterian dean of residence. Cooke, who from 1835 had been lecturer on ethics to the students of his church, was offered by the assembly (14 September 1847) his choice of the newly endowed chairs of ethics and sacred rhetoric; he chose the latter, and was shortly afterwards made president of the faculty. The assembly's college buildings were opened in 1853. On becoming professor Cooke was compelled by the law of the assembly to resign the pastoral office; but at the urgent desire of his congregation he continued to discharge all its duties, being appointed by his presbytery 'constant supplier' until the election of a successor, John S. M'Intosh, who was installed 4 March 1868. His resignation of congregational emolument was absolute; for twenty years he served his congregation gratuitously. In 1829 Cooke received the degree of D.D. from Jefferson College (now Washington & Jefferson College), U.S., and in 1837 that of LL.D. from Trinity College, Dublin. On various occasions, especially in 1841 and 1865, public presentations were made to him in recognition of his labours. The sums continually raised by his preaching on special occasions were remarkable tributes to the persuasion of his eloquence. He had a noble presence and thrilling voice; he was a master of the art of stating a case, had an unexpected reply to every argument of an opponent, seldom failed to make an adversary ridiculous, and when he rose to vehemence the strokes of his genius were overwhelming. In the reports of his speeches there is nothing so fine as his elegy on Castlereagh (in the debate on voluntaryism with Dr. Ritchie of Edinburgh, March 1836), a passage imperfectly reported, because it is said the pressmen 'dropped their pencils and sat with eyes riveted on the speaker'. Character of Cooke Relief bust of Cooke, on the Omagh Orange Hall Cooke's habits of work would have been impossible without the aid of an iron constitution: he rose at four, needed little sleep, and traveled, spoke, and wrote with incessant energy. In public a dangerous and unsparing (some said an unscrupulous) foe, his private disposition was that of warm-hearted kindness. Relations of personal friendliness between him and his old antagonist, Montgomery, sprang up in their later years. Stern Protestant as he was, none was more prompt to render assistance to a Roman Catholic neighbour in time of need. A strict disciplinarian, he leaned always to the side of mercy when the courts of his church had to deal with delinquents. Cooke's biographer, who was his son-in-law Josias Leslie Porter, quotes from Lord Cairns the saying that for half a century his life \\"was a large portion of the religious and public history of Ireland\\". Orangemen carry his likeness on their banners (though he was not an orangeman), and his statue in Belfast (erected in September 1875) is still a symbol of the Protestantism of Northern Ireland. Marriage and Death Balmoral Cemetery Cooke died at his residence in Ormeau Road, Belfast, on Sunday, 13 December 1868. A public funeral was voted to him on the motion of Robert Knox, Bishop of Down, Connor and Dromore. He was buried in the Balmoral Cemetery on 18 December. In 1813 he married Ellen Mann of Toome, who died on 30 June 1868; by her he had thirteen children. Publications Cooke's first publication was a charity sermon preached at Belfast 18 December 1814, which went through three editions in 1815; of this discourse Reid says 'it is remarkable for the absence of evangelical sentiment'. Remarkable also is Cooke's collection of hymns under the title, Translations and Paraphrases in Verse ... for the use of the Presbyterian Church, Killileagh, (1821), with a closely reasoned preface, in which he condemns restriction to the psalms of David in Christian worship; in later life he had the strongest antipathy to the public use of any hymnal but the metrical psalms. In 1839 he undertook a new edition of Brown's Self- interpreting Bible, (1855). The manuscript of an analytical concordance, begun in 1834 and finished in 1841, which he had taken to London for publication, perished in a fire at his hotel. Sermons, pamphlets, and magazine articles in great abundance flowed from his pen.

Grandad Bluff is a classic mesa, as are all the bluffs along the river.Granddad Bluff ; Steven Dutch, Natural and Applied Sciences, University of Wisconsin - Green Bay; September 9, 2005; Retrieved October 26, 2007 History The land comprising much of Grandad Bluff was first purchased from the state by Judge George Gale in July 1851. Between 1851 and 1912, there were 83 transfers of the property. The bluff was used as a source of construction materials, and its limestone was quarried for many years. The bluff was to be sold for large-scale quarrying, however the La Crosse residents were outraged by the plans. To save the bluff from ruin, Joseph & Irene Hixon, a prominent La Crosse family, purchased the land in 1909. The family held the property in trust until 1912 when the land was donated as a park to the city of La Crosse. A group of residents, led by G. C. Hixon, raised $15,000 to construct roads and purchase more land around the bluff. The area below Grandad Bluff became the center of Hixon Forest, which continues to serve as a popular hiking area. In 1928 there was a movement to change the name of the bluff to Granddad Mountain, and to name the series of bluffs along the Mississippi River \\"The Mississippi Mountain Range\\".William L. Doudna, \\"Bluff or Mountain?\\" La Crosse Tribune, July 10, 1928. A shelter was constructed in Grandad Bluff Park in 1938 by the Works Progress Administration using stone quarried from the south side of the bluff. In 1941, a 65-foot flagpole was erected by the La Crosse chapter of Reserve Officers Association using money raised by school children. Eleven years later, in 1952, a rustic split rail fence of native oak was constructed, along with two new picnic areas with parking. The shelter was wired with electricity in 1954, and public restrooms were constructed about ten years later. A new pump house was built in 1976. Landscaping projects were completed during the 1980s, and a new 75-foot flagpole was erected by the La Crosse Jaycees in 1994.

On 14 September 2013, the United States and Russia announced an agreement for the elimination of Syria's chemical weapon stockpiles by June 2014. In October 2013, the OPCW-UN Joint Mission destroyed all of Syria's declared chemical weapons manufacturing and mixing equipment. Several months later, Syria disclosed that it maintained a ricin chemical weapons program, which the Syrian government claims has fallen into the hands of Syrian Opposition forces in the east of the country. The following month Syria, further disclosed that it had 4 more previously hidden chemical weapons production sites. The Israeli intelligence community believes the Syrian government retains several tons of chemical weapons. Syria sought to develop nuclear weapons with help from North Korea, but its plutonium production reactor was destroyed by the Israeli Air Force in 2007 (see Operation Orchard). The Syria file at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) remains open, amid Syria's failure to respond to the IAEA's questions about the destroyed facility, that the IAEA concluded was \\"very likely\\" a nuclear reactor, including the whereabouts of the reactor's nuclear fuel. In January 2015, it was reported that the Syrian government is suspected to be building a nuclear plant in Al-Qusayr, Syria.  Background  Following the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights during the 1967 Six-Day War, and South Lebanon in 1978, the Syrian government has regarded Israeli military power as a threat to Syrian security. Syria first acquired chemical weapons from Egypt in 1973 as a military deterrent against Israel before launching the Yom Kippur War. Despite the fact that Syrian officials did not explicitly declare the chemical weapons capability, they implied it through speeches and in addition warned of retaliations. Internal Syrian chemical weapons capability may have been developed with indirect Russian, German, Chinese technical and logistical support. It is likely Syria imported dual-use chemical weapon precursors and production equipment from West Europe, China and North Korea. In 1997, security analyst Zuhair Diab, who worked for the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a diplomat from 1981 to 1985, wrote that Israeli nuclear weapons were a primary motivation for the Syrian chemical weapons program. Their rivalry with Iraq and Turkey were also important considerations. On 23 July 2012 Syria implicitly confirmed it possessed a stockpile of chemical weapons which it says are reserved for national defense against foreign countries. During the Syrian Civil War, in August 2012, the Syrian military restarted chemical weapons testing at a base on the outskirts of Aleppo. Chemical weapons were a major point of discussion between the Syrian government and world leaders, with military intervention being considered by the West as a potential consequence of the use of such weapons.  Chemical weapons  =Syria's chemical weapons program= Syria's chemical weapons program began in the 1970s with weapons and training from Egypt and the Soviet Union, with production of chemical weapons in Syria beginning in the mid-1980s. In the July 2007 Syrian arms depot explosion, there were suggestions that the incident involved a secret chemical weapons facility. Prior to September 2013 Syria was one of a handful of states which had not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, and had not publicly admitted to possessing chemical weapons, although Western intelligence services believed it to hold a massive stockpile.Congressional Research Service, 12 September 2013, Syria's Chemical Weapons: Issues for Congress In September 2013, French intelligence put the Syrian stockpile at 1,000 tonnes, including Yperite, VX and \\"several hundred tonnes of sarin\\". After international condemnation of the August 2013 Ghouta chemical attack, for which Western states held the Syrian government responsible (whilst Syria and Russia held the Syrian rebels of the Syrian civil war responsible), in September 2013 Syria joined the Convention (formally acceding on 14 October), as part of its agreement to the destruction of its chemical weapons under the supervision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. In October 2013, the OPCW found a total of 1,300 tons of chemical weapons. On 16 October 2013, the OPCW and the United Nations formally established a joint mission to oversee the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons program by mid-2014, which was declared completed in January 2016. According to Reuters, a chemical analysis done in January 2018 on the destroyed stockpile samples match some chemical markers such as hexamine, unique to the Syrian recipe for sarin, with samples from the 21 August 2013 Ghouta attack and also from interviewees' samples from Khan Sheikhoun and Khan Al-Assal attack sites. In June 2019, United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy stated that the United States \\"will respond quickly and appropriately,\\" if the regime uses chemical weapons again. He added that Bashar al-Assad has done more than any other to destabilize the region by \\"murdering his own people\\" and that both Russia and the Syrian regime have shown no concern for the suffering of the Syrian people creating one of the \\"worst humanitarian tragedies in history\\". =Syrian opposition chemical weapons capability= The Syrian government claims that the opposition has the capacity to launch large chemical attacks such as those seen at Ghouta. Sources such as the United States and Human Rights Watch disagree, claiming there is no significant evidence the opposition has any significant chemical weapons capability. A Syrian military source told SANA, the official news agency in Syria, that the Syrian Army seized two containers with sarin together with automatic rifles, pistols and homemade bombs (IEDs) in a rebel hideout in the al-Faraieh neighborhood (also spelled Al-Faraya) of the city of Hama on 1 June 2013, which has been the scene of fighting between government troops and armed opposition groups. The Syrian government declared the two cylinders \\"as abandoned chemical weapons\\" and told the OPCW that \\"the items did not belong to\\" them. On 14 June 2014, the Joint OPCW-UN Mission confirmed that the cylinders contained sarin. On 7 July 2014, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon informed the UN Security Council about the findings. In December 2013 investigative journalist Seymour Hersh controversially reported that multiple U.S. intelligence agencies had allegedly produced top secret assessments in the summer of 2013, regarding Syrian rebel's supposed chemical weapons capabilities. The alleged assessments were said by Hersh to have concluded that the Al-Nusra Front and Al-Qaeda in Iraq were capable of acquiring, producing, and deploying sarin gas \\"in quantity\\". A spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence replied that Hersh's report was \\"simply false.\\"Dylan Byers \\"White House: Sy Hersh report 'false'\\" , Politico, 9 December 2013 On 8 April 2016, a spokesman for the rebel group said that \\"weapons not authorized for use in these types of confrontations\\" had been used against Kurdish militia and civilians in the Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood in Aleppo. He stated that \\"One of our commanders has unlawfully used a type of weapon that is not included in our list\\". He did not specify what substances were used but, according to the Kurdish Red Crescent, the symptoms were consistent with the use of chlorine gas or other agents. Welat Memo, a physician with the Kurdish Red Crescent, said that the people affected are \\"vomiting and having difficulty in breathing.\\" Jaysh al- Islam subsequently clarified that it was referring to \\"modified Grad rockets,\\" not chemical weapons.Sam Heller One Kurdish Neighborhood in the Crossfire , Daily Beast, 15 April 2016 =ISIS mustard gas use= The BBC reported in September 2015 that, according to an unnamed U.S. official, the U.S. believes that ISIS had used powdered mustard agent at least four times in Syria and Iraq, that ISIS had probably manufactured the mustard agent itself, and probably had an active chemical weapons research team. Mustard agent is a relatively simple chemical weapon to manufacture, and given the Syrian government's chemical-weapons disarmament, analysts deemed it unlikely that ISIS had acquired the mustard agent from seizing a Syrian government cache. The BBC further stated that a BBC team on the Turkey-Syria border had seen corroborating evidence.  Biological weapons  Syria is generally considered not to have biological weapons. However, there are some reports of an active biological weapons research and production program. According to NATO Consultant Dr Jill Dekker, Syria has worked on: anthrax, plague, tularemia, botulism, smallpox, aflatoxin, cholera, ricin and camelpox, and has used Russian help in installing anthrax in missile warheads. She also stated \\"they view their bio-chemical arsenal as part of a normal weapons program\\".  Nuclear program  Syria has been a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) since 24 September 1969, and has a limited civil nuclear program. In 1991 China sold a miniature neutron source reactor called SRR-1 to Syria. Before the start of the Syrian Civil War Syria was known to operate only the Chinese reactor. Despite claiming to be a proponent of a Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone (WMDFZ) in the Middle East (Syria has not handed a letter confirming its support for WMDFZ), Syria was accused of pursuing a military nuclear program with a reported nuclear facility in a desert Syrian region of Deir ez-Zor. The reactor's components were believed to have been designed and manufactured in North Korea, with the reactor's striking similarity in shape and size to the North Korean Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. The nuclear reactor was still under construction. That information alarmed Israeli military and intelligence to such a degree that the idea of a targeted airstrike was conceived, resulting in Operation Outside the Box on 6 September 2007 that saw as many as eight Israeli aircraft destroying the facility. Israeli government is said to have bounced the idea of the operation off the US Bush administration, although the latter declined to participate. U.S. intelligence officials claimed low confidence that the site was meant for weapons development. The nuclear reactor was destroyed in the Israeli attack, which also killed about ten North Korean workers. The attack did not cause an international outcry or any serious Syrian retaliatory moves as both parties tried to keep it secret: Israel didn't want publicity as regards its breach of the cease fire while Syria did not want to acknowledge the existence of its clandestine nuclear program. = Open nuclear programs = Syria has attempted to purchase small research type nuclear reactors from China, Russia, Argentina, or other countries. Despite these attempted purchases being openly disclosed and IAEA monitored, international pressure led to all these purchases being cancelled. Syria had open and IAEA monitored nuclear research programs including a Chinese made non-reactor miniature neutron source.Syria - Nuclear Weapons Programs at globalsecurity.org , accessed 24 October 2007. On 26 November 2008 IAEA Board of Governors approved technical aid for Syria despite Western allegations that Syria had a secret atomic program that could eventually be used to make weapons. China, Russia and developing nations criticized Western \\"political interference\\" that they said undermined IAEA's program to foster civilian atomic energy development. The top U.N. nuclear official also strongly rebuked Western powers for trying to deny the request, saying this should not be done without evidence and merely on the existence of an investigation. =Alleged nuclear reactor= Satellite photo of the destroyed site Intelligence photo of the alleged reactor vessel under construction Intelligence photo of the alleged reactor head and fuel channels under construction Bombing of alleged reactor On 6 September 2007, Israel bombed an officially unidentified site in Syria which it believed had been a nuclear reactor under construction,6 September 2007 Air strike at globalsecurity.org , accessed 24 October 2007. in an operation called Operation Outside the Box. It was further claimed that the nuclear reactor was not yet operational and no nuclear material had been introduced into it.IAEA: Statement by IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei regarding Syria Top U.S. intelligence officials claimed that the site was meant for weapons development. Western press reports asserted that the Israeli air strike followed a shipment delivery to Syria by a North Korean freighter, and that North Korea was suspected to be supplying a reactor to Syria for a nuclear weapons program.N. Korea, Syria May Be at Work on Nuclear Facility , Glenn Kessler, Washington Post, 13 September 2007; Page A12 On 24 October 2007 the Institute for Science and International Security released a report which identified a site in eastern Syria's Deir ez-Zor Governorate province as the suspected reactor. The report speculated about similarities between the Syrian building and North Korea's Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, but said that it was too early to make a definitive comparison.SUSPECT REACTOR CONSTRUCTION SITE IN EASTERN SYRIA: THE SITE OF THE SEPTEMBER 6 ISRAELI RAID? , David Albright and Paul Brannan, 23 October 2007 On 25 October 2007, Western media said the main building and any debris from it following the air strike had been completely dismantled and removed by the Syrians.Photos Show Cleansing of Suspect Syrian Site , William J. Broad and Mark Mazzetti, New York Times, accessed 25 October 2007. Reaction to allegations On 23 June 2008, IAEA inspectors were allowed to visit the Dair Alzour site (also referred to as Al Kibar), and take samples of the debris. On 19 November 2008 an IAEA report stated that \\"a significant number of natural uranium particles\\" produced as a result of chemical processing were found at the Al Kibar site; however, the IAEA did not find sufficient evidence to prove Syria is developing nuclear weapons. Some American nuclear experts have speculated about similarities between the alleged Syrian reactor and North Korea's Yongybon reactor but IAEA Director General ElBaradei has pointed out that \\"there was uranium but it doesn't mean there was a reactor\\". ElBaradei has shown dissatisfaction with the United States and Israel for only providing the IAEA with photos of the bombed facility in Syria, and has also urged caution against prematurely judging Syria's atomic program by reminding diplomats about false U.S. claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.Star Tribune: UN nuclear agency chief urges caution against Syria by recalling false claims against Iraq Russia, China, Iran, and non-aligned countries have also supported giving Syria nuclear guidance despite pressure from the United States. Joseph Cirincione, an expert on nuclear proliferation and head of the Washington-based Ploughshares Fund, commented \\"we should learn first from the past and be very cautious about any intelligence from the US about other country's weapons.\\" Syria has denounced \\"the fabrication and forging of facts\\" in regards to the incident. IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei criticized the strikes and deplored that information regarding the matter had not been shared with his agency earlier.IAEA slams U.S. for withholding data on alleged Syrian nuclear reactor Syria has declined to let the IAEA visit other military sites the United States recently made allegations about, arguing it fears that too much openness on its part would encourage the U.S. to push for years of relentless international scrutiny. Syria has said it will voluntarily cooperate with the IAEA further if it isn't \\"at the expense of disclosing our military sites or causing a threat to our national security.\\" The Non-Aligned Movement has called for the establishment of a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East and called for a comprehensive multilaterally negotiated instrument which prohibits threats of attacks on nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Gulf Cooperation Council has also appealed for a nuclear weapons free Middle East and recognition of the right of a country to expertise in the field of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The IAEA has also approved a resolution urging all Middle East nations to renounce atomic bombs. =IAEA inspections = After refusing to comment on the reports for six months, the Bush administration briefed Congress and the IAEA on 24 April 2008, saying that the U.S. Government was \\"convinced\\" that Syria had been building a \\"covert nuclear reactor\\" that was \\"not intended for peaceful purposes.\\" The briefing included releases of satellite photographs of the bombed site and overhead and ground level intelligence photographs of the site under construction, including the alleged reactor vessel steel shell before concrete was poured and of the alleged reactor head structure. On 27 April 2008, Syrian President Bashar al- Assad had said the Dair Alzour site was just \\"a military site under construction, not a nuclear site as Israel and America claimed,\\" and that Syria's goal is a nuclear-free Middle East.Daiji Sadamori, \\"Assad: Syria Not Seeking to be Nuclear State,\\" Asahi Shimbun, 27 October 2006 Syria allowed an IAEA visit to the site on 23 June 2008, which took environmental samples that revealed the presence of man-made uranium and other materials consistent with a reactor. Syria refused IAEA requests for further information on or access to the Dair Alzour site. A 2009 IAEA investigation reported evidence of uranium and graphite and concluded that the site bore features resembling an undeclared nuclear reactor. IAEA was initially unable to confirm or deny the nature of the site because, according to IAEA, Syria failed to provide necessary cooperation with the IAEA investigation. Syria has disputed these claims. On 24 May 2011, IAEA Director General Amano released a report concluding that the destroyed building was \\"very likely\\" a nuclear reactor, which Syria had been required to declare under its NPT safeguards agreement.GOV/2011/30 , Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Syrian Arab Republic, Report by the Director General, 24 May 2011.

Delivery systems  The U.S. National Air and Space Intelligence Center reported in 2009 that Syria possessed road-mobile Scud-D and Tochka missiles, with fewer than 100 launchers. In addition Syria has aircraft and artillery delivery systems. International partnerships United States diplomatic cables revealed that two Indian firms aided Syrian chemical and biological weapon makers in trying to obtain Australia Group-controlled equipment. One cable stated that India \\"has a general obligation as a Chemical Weapons Convention State Party to never, under any circumstances, assist anyone in the development of chemical weapons\\". In 2012, Iranian and North Korean officials and scientists were brought to bases and testing areas to aid in the development and use of chemical weapons. In November 2014, the anti-government Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that five nuclear scientists, one of which that was Iranian national, were assassinated by a gunman in Damascus. The pro- government Al-Watan's account differed, reporting that \\"four nuclear scientists and electrical engineers\\" were killed. Al-Watan suggested the Nusra Front might be behind the attack; others suspect Israel.

The northern part of the municipality grades into the foothills of the Cordillera Septentrional. The southern boundary of Bison√≥ municipality is formed by the Yaque del Norte River. Across the river to the south is the municipal district of La Canela, to the southwest and west is the province of Valverde, to the north is the municipality of Altamira of Puerto Plata Province, to the southeast is the municipality of Villa Gonzalez and to the northeast is the municipal district of El Limon. =Settlements= The major town is Villa Bison√≥, often known as Navarrete. It was formally recognized in 1956 and named after a local land owner Jos√© El√≠as Bison√≥. The town is at the junction of highways DR-1 and DR-5. The town has several neighborhoods (barrios), including Barrio 27 de Febrero, Barrio Los Candelones, Bario Duarte, Bario La Mella, Barrio Nuevo (Jeremias), Barrio Rotonda, Barrio San Miguel, Barrio Trinitaria, and Jalisco. Other settlements include Las Atravesadas, Ca√±ada Bonita, Ponton, Pontoncito, El Estacion and Villanueva. History In 1939 the area, known as Navarrete, was placed under the rural administration of the municipality of Santiago. In 1956 the settlement of Villa Bison√≥, Navarrete, was recognized. In the late 1950s the area was upgraded to a municipal district under the name Navarrete, but still within the Santiago municipality. In 1962 the area was elevated to the category of municipality within the province of Santiago, with the name \\"Bison√≥\\", although often referred to as \\"Villa Bison√≥\\" or \\"Navarrete\\".

B. Aleksandrov and Douglas Clark, who discovered some of their deepest properties. The measures are also called either Aleksandrov measures, Clark measures, or occasionally spectral measures. AC measures are used to extract information about self-maps of the unit disc, and have applications in a number of areas of complex analysis, most notably those related to operator theory. Systems of AC measures have also been constructed for higher dimensions, and for the half-plane. Construction of the measures The original construction of Clark relates to one-dimensional perturbations of compressed shift operators on subspaces of the Hardy space: : H^2(\\\\mathbb{D},\\\\mathbb{C}). By virtue of Beurling's theorem, any shift-invariant subspace of this space is of the form : \\\\theta H^2(\\\\mathbb{D},\\\\mathbb{C}), where \\\\theta is an inner function. As such, any invariant subspace of the adjoint of the shift is of the form : K_\\\\theta = \\\\left(\\\\theta H^2(\\\\mathbb{D},\\\\mathbb{C})\\\\right)^\\\\perp. We now define S_\\\\theta to be the shift operator compressed to K_\\\\theta, that is : S_\\\\theta = P_{K_\\\\theta} S_{K_\\\\theta}. Clark noticed that all the one-dimensional perturbations of S_\\\\theta, which were also unitary maps, were of the form : U_\\\\alpha (f) = S_\\\\theta (f) + \\\\alpha \\\\left\\\\langle f , \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{z} \\\\right\\\\rangle, and related each such map to a measure, \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha on the unit circle, via the Spectral theorem. This collection of measures, one for each \\\\alpha on the unit circle ^\\\\mathbb{T}, is then called the collection of AC measures associated with \\\\theta. An alternative construction The collection of measures may also be constructed for any analytic function (that is, not necessarily an inner function). Given an analytic self map, \\\\phi, of the unit disc, ^\\\\mathbb{D}, we can construct a collection of functions, u_\\\\alpha, given by : u_\\\\alpha(z) = \\\\Re \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha + \\\\varphi(z)}{\\\\alpha - \\\\varphi(z)}\\\\right), one for each ^{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathbb{T}}. Each of these functions is positive and harmonic, so by Herglotz' Theorem each is the Poisson integral of some positive measure \\\\mu_\\\\alpha on ^\\\\mathbb{T}. This collection is the set of AC measures associated with \\\\varphi. It can be shown that the two definitions coincide for inner functions.

With over 100 titles currently in print, the Center is the largest publisher of exclusively Louisiana-related books in the world. It also serves as a research facility and archival repository. History Founded in 1973, the Center for Louisiana Studies grew around the University's copies of the Louisiana Colonial Records Collection. Begun in 1967, the Collection attempts to draw together available microfilmed copies of any and all primary source records focused on the discovery, exploration, settlement, and development of the Mississippi Valley between 1682 and 1803. To date, over 1,000,000 pages of archival material have been photoduplicated from French archives; over 1.5 million pages copied from Spanish archives; over 20,000 pages of documentary evidence from British depositories; and over 165,000 pages of material have been collected from various Louisiana sources. Together with the Library of Congress and the University of Memphis, the Center is one of only three repositories for the colonial documents of France in the United States. Another important impetus for the founding of the Center was the creation of The University of Southwestern Louisiana History Series (U.S.L. being the former name of The University of Louisiana). Glenn Conrad, the director of the Center from 1973 to 2003, edited the U.S.L. History Series from its establishment in 1970 until the fifteenth and final title in 1985. This Series established the Center for Louisiana Studies as a significant regional publishing center. The Center received a significant boost with the publication of The Courthouses of Louisiana and The Cajuns: Essays on their History and Culture. Although sales of these titles were modest by publishing standards, that small amount nevertheless allowed the Center to continuously expand the quality of its product Other important series from the Center were the U.S.L. Architecture Series, which followed from the Courthouses of Louisiana (1978); the Louisiana Life Series, covering the rich cultures of South Louisiana, including such diverse topics as Cajun culture, Jazz, the Acadian diaspora, New Orleans cemeteries, Voodoo, and others; and the Louisiana Purchase Bicentennial Series in Louisiana History, the most ambitious Louisiana-related publication project ever undertaken by any publisher. The Center has also published many titles on Louisiana genealogy and civil records. The Center also comprises The Center for Cultural and Ecotourism, and is partnered with The Center for Acadian and Creole Folklore.

Overview Lawson Oyedokun Oyekan was born in 1961 in Stockwell, England and grew up in Ibadan, son of a Nigerian high court Judge, attended Loyola College, Ibadan, Nigeria, West Africa, returning to England in 1983 to study art where he attended the art foundation course in East Ham. Initially learning the practice of throwing with porcelain, Oyekan created diaphragm-like artworks with a lifted centre. He then moved on to making hand-built larger, monolithic forms. Both of these constructions include his experiences as a Londoner, as well as an African. His pieces are adorned with piercings and sometimes include text in English or his native language, Yoruba. There is a presence in Oyekan's forms that speak of his experiences and his upbringing. \\"My intent is to express human endurance and deliver a message of reassurance: that human suffering can be healed.\\" Ceramics Today. \\"Lawson Oyekan, Winner of the Grand Prize Award for the 1st World Ceramic Biennale 2001 Korea.http://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/the-1st-world-ceramic-biennale-2001-korea-international-competition- and-exhibition-71487237.html prnewswire.com Beginning his studies in Nigeria with applied Chemistry and later studied a diploma in general art at The Ibadan Polytechnic, Ibadan. Lawson then returned to England in 1983 to pursue art. First studying at Central School of Art and Design in 1985 on a degree course, he then went on to study at the Royal College of Art in London from 1988-1990 where he was lectured by the likes of Eduardo Paolozzi. During his studies, he received the Darwin Scholarship Award in 1989 and is most notable for receiving the Grand Prize Award in the 2001 Korean Biennale for his piece \\"HEALING BEING,\\" from his Coming up for Air series. As a contemporary sculptor currently making work, he shows and exhibits work all over the world in Europe, Korea, Japan, and the United States. Work description and Style Passage with Palmprint One of Oyekan's best-known works is the \\"HEALING BEING\\" piece from his Coming Up for Air series. This piece is a monolithic, terracotta sculpture, closed, measuring 6 feet and 7 inches in height. Lawson's work is characterized by surfaces often left dry and unglazed, while other works include a variety of coloured slips. A recent exhibition in Minnesota in 2006, Solstice Lip Series, includes a combination of steady stoneware ceramic vessels including a variety of whistling adjacent perforations on congruent monoliths. The passage of light as well as the ability for the pieces to \\"breathe\\" is a concern in portraying a life in his work through these vessels. The development of Lawson's work comes from his training in England in porcelain wheel throwing to the development of his own techniques through hand building, providing his experiences that come from these two locations and lifestyles. Currently Lawson is living in London, England while also working in a studio in Denmark. He also has plans to open a studio in Nigeria in combination with an education facility.

Overview East Coast bias is used to explain perceived slights of teams and players relative to their comparable counterparts on the West Coast. It is attributed to East Coast sports stories being more repetitive, comprehensive, and exaggerated. \\"In America news still travels from east to west,\\" wrote author George Will in Men at Work: The Craft of Baseball. The bias is also used to rationalize the broadcasting of an East Coast team in favor of another compelling team based to the west. National coverage of live games is also perceived as favoring certain teams located on the Eastern side of the continent. For example, critics of what Hockey Night in Canada chooses to program allege that the show particularly favors the Toronto Maple Leafs. Likewise, ESPN's baseball coverage has been the target of criticism because of its perceived bias towards the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees. Causes Time zone map of North America The North American continent is divided into seven time zones, spanning 6¬Ω hours from Alaska to Newfoundland. Most of the continent's population (including all of the major professional sports teams) is concentrated in the four time zones of the contiguous United States and Canada west of the Maritimes; this, however, still poses a significant obstacle in that the easternmost sports teams are a full three hours ahead of their western counterparts. For sports that play in prime time according to local time zones (as is the case with ice hockey, baseball, and basketball), this can result in games played on the West Coast starting after 10 p.m. Eastern time (and not ending until around or after 1 a.m.), while the East is sleeping and after printing deadlines for the next day's newspapers have passed. Gennaro Filice of SI.com wrote that Major League Baseball's West Coast night games are ending as \\"the country's most influential scribes are catching Z after Z.\\" John Buccigross of ESPN notes that a lot of people in the East are asleep when National Hockey League's West night games are going on, resulting in lower television ratings for those West Coast games, which in turn contributes to the lack of national broadcasts of West games. In the United States, the major media hub is the East Coast city of New York. CBS Sports has its headquarters within the Manhattan borough of the city, and NBC Sports, MLB Network, and NHL Network all have their hubs in the metropolitan area (NBC is based in Stamford, Connecticut, while MLB/NHL share the former studios of MSNBC in Secaucus, New Jersey); ESPN is in Bristol, Connecticut, which is roughly equidistant to both New York and Boston. Meanwhile, Turner Sports is based in Atlanta, Georgia, also on the East Coast. Canada's two major media hubs, Toronto (for English-language media) and Montr√©al (for French-language media), are also both located in the Eastern Time Zone. Only Fox Sports and its cable channel Fox Sports 1 maintain their major broadcast hub in Los Angeles, along with the Pac-12 Networks in San Francisco, though FS1 and the Pac-12 Network's sports rights are limited to the point where they are thought of as an aberration (and Fox Sports itself is the major broadcast partner for college basketball's East Coast-centric Big East Conference). Buccigross wrote that an imbalance is understandable from Eastern writers, considering they are influenced by their close proximity and easier access to the happenings in the East. The East is home to nearly half of the country's population and is both more densely populated and was settled and developed much earlier than the West. Fox Sports sportscaster Joe Buck attributes the shift to the economics of running a business: \\"If you think there is a perceived East Coast bias, guess what? You're right. That's where people are watching, that's where the numbers are.\\" ESPN ombudsman Le Anne Schreiber wrote that fans should forget about expecting equity in teams the network selects to broadcast. \\"It is long proven in NBA and NFL and MLB that spreading the wealth to 30 or 32 teams is a prescription for deflating ratings,\\" said Len DeLuca, ESPN senior vice president for programming.

Its title is a play on words on For Your Eyes Only, the title of the James Bond film released that same year. A sequel was produced in 1982, titled The Impossible Kid. Weng Weng is known as the shortest man to ever be a lead in a feature film, standing at 2'9\\" (83 cm). Plot The diminutive Agent 00, the number 1 agent from the Secret Agency, is provided with a number of new hi-tech gadgets from his boss, and then sent to stop the mysterious warlord Mr. Giant, who has just kidnapped Dr. Kohler, a foreign scientist visiting Manila to offer his latest invention, the N-Bomb, to the government. Mr. Giant intends to use the lethal weapon to take over the world, but Agent 00 is ready to stop him. He can count on the help of Irma, a fellow agent who has infiltrated Mr. Giant's criminal organization, working for the drug traffickers that are headed by a gangster named Cobra. This leads to many battles between Agent 00 and the villain's henchmen. Once Irma's cover is blown, she is taken prisoner as a bait and sent to Mr. Kaiser, Mr. Giant's second-in-command, who keeps her in his lair. In order to find Kaiser, Agent 00 enlists the help of other Bond girl types, such as night club enthusiast Anna and criminal reporter Marilyn, romancing his way to their allegiance. After flushing out and killing criminal bosses of increasing importance, and all of their henchmen, Agent 00 reaches Kaiser, but by then Irma has been shipped to Hidden Island, Mr. Giant's super-secret lair. After finding the secret location of the island, Agent 00 uses a prototype size- compatible jet pack to get there, and calls for reinforcements. He confronts and kill Mr. Giant himself (who's revealed to be a dwarf himself, although taller than Agent 00), then along with the squad of agents from the Secret Agency, Agent 00 and Irma clean the island of all remaining henchmen. However, right after a freed Dr. Kohler has finally reached safety, Irma is shot and killed. In the final scene, Agent 00 is seen paying respect on her tomb. Gadgets Agent 00 has gadgets that are especially made for him and his size. Among these: * Anti-Poison Ring - a ring that changes color when placed in proximity of poison. * Remote-Control Hat - a hat used as a flying, bladed boomerang. * Quick-Assembly, Small-Scale Machine Gun - a special machine gun, made to scale, to use in battle. * Tiny Jetpack - used by 00 to get to Mr. Giant's island in the finale. Release For Your Height Only was released on the 2nd of September 1981 in the Philippines. That same year First Lady Imelda Marcos organized the first Manilla International Film Festival. The objective of the festival was to promote Filipino films for them to be distributed worldwide. A lavish event took place, major entertainment figures were present including Priscilla Presley, Franco Nero, Brooke Shields, Jeremy Irons, etc. Local filmmakers saw it as a real opportunity to showcase their talents, however it was Weng Weng who became the mediatic center of attention, by making daily appearances demonstrating stunts, martial arts, and exercises. For Your Height Only outsold every other film for international distribution.  Reception and legacy  In the Cinema of the Philippines, For Your Height Only is the highest exported film. For Your Height Only is Weng Weng's breakthrough film and turned him into Philippines' first international star, within their acting community his worldwide reach hasn't been topped. Imee Marcos said its success at the festival shocked and shattered everyone's artistic aspirations. Filipino film historians Teddy Co and Ed Lejano said that in the film industry the Weng Weng image was uncomfortable since at the time they had no other international figures. Film distributor Tony Maharaj who bought the film for the West Indies said the film opened at number one on the same day as Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark and remained there for two weeks.

At least five known examples have been created, all pitched in BBBb, sounding a full octave lower than standard BBb contrabass tubas. Music for them is written in bass clef sounding a full octave lower than notated. The Harvard University Band's BBBb Besson Tuba \\"Riesenba√ü\\" tuba made by Bohland & Fuchs History The first existence of an instrument of this sort was designed by the Parisian instrument innovator Adolphe Sax (1814‚Äì1894), the inventor of the saxophone, who dubbed it the subcontrabass saxhorn. These instruments were all very rare and never received a great deal of attention. The first two modern instruments were built by Besson on the suggestion of American Bandmaster John Philip Sousa, who toured using one in his band from 1896-1898. One of this pair, the only known playable instrument of its kind, is owned by the Harvard University Band and is still played periodically in concerts. In the 1950s, British musician Gerard Hoffnung commissioned the London subcontrabass tuba for use in his comedic music festivals, and also commissioned a work: Variations on \\"Annie Laurie\\" (1956) by Gordon Jacob, specifically including the instrument. A tuba pitched in FFF was made in Kraslice by Bohland & Fuchs probably during 1910 or 1911 and was destined for the World Exhibition in New York in 1913 (Green).

Accessed 10 February 2013 was a Welsh-born schoolteacher, writer and folklorist who became a dedicated collector of oral history and oral tradition in the East Anglian countryside from the 1940s to 1970s, and produced eleven books of collections of these materials. Life and career Evans was born in Abercynon, a coal-mining village north of Cardiff, one of a family of eleven, to Welsh-speaking parents who ran a grocery business. Reflecting the Liberal politics of his father, his middle name was inspired by William Ewart Gladstone, and Gladstone became one of his nicknames. As a boy he assisted in the delivery rounds travelling by pony and trap through the neighbouring farms and villages until the business closed following the 1924-5 coal strike. He went to grammar school, and studied classics at Cardiff University. After an unsuccessful attempt to move to London, he obtained work during the 1930s as a schoolmaster at Sawston Village College, Cambridgeshire, married, and started a family. After serving in the Royal Air Force with wireless equipment during the Second World War, he moved briefly to London, and then in 1947 to the remote Suffolk village of Blaxhall, where his wife taught in the school. He then began to write, first stories, poetry and film scripts for the BBC, and then writing a book about the people of the village of Blaxhall. This work (Ask The Fellows Who Cut The Hay) was, after many rejections, published by Faber and Faber in 1956, and the same house published the ten further books of similar character which Evans wrote over the next three decades. The Evans family lived relatively simply, moving their home in the neighbourhood to Needham Market and Helmingham to follow the teaching posts, and at his wife's retirement they settled down finally in Brooke, a small Norfolk village, where George continued to write. Evans made extensive collections of oral history on tape relating to East Anglia, its village life, rural culture and dialect in a painstaking and sympathetic way, gathering anecdotes of the trades, the poverty, the migrant workers and the pre-modern rural way of life which was then still lingering in that comparatively sequestered corner of England. He maintained a long correspondence with the writer Robert Graves, and collaborated with his friend David Thomson of the BBC on the book The Leaping Hare. Although his books have a strong flavour of memory and nostalgia, they record a time (extending back into the nineteenth century) that was hard and to which one would not seriously wish to return.

Harvey G. Cohen in his 2010 book Duke Ellington's America writes that \\"Rocks in My Bed\\" \\"presents a more honest and adult impression of sexual loneliness than most Swing Era lyrics\\". The lyrics arose from a conversation between two women that Ellington overheard. The academic Walter van de Leur theorized in his analysis of several Ellington pieces of the early 1940s that \\"Rocks in My Bed\\" may have been partially written by Billy Strayhorn yet solely copyrighted to Ellington without additional attribution. Van de Leur analysed Strayhorn's reharmonisation of the piece for Ivie Anderson's 1941 vocal recording and felt that it marks the moment that Strayhorn \\"changed from arranger to co- composer\\". It was introduced by Big Joe Turner in the 1941 musical revue Jump for Joy. Turner said in an interview that he assisted Ellington with the arrangement and composition of \\"Rocks in My Bed\\" whilst in preparation for Jump for Joy at the Dunbar Hotel. \\"Rocks in My Bed\\" was included in the 1997 musical comedy Play On! at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre directed by Sheldon Epps.

An early vita was composed about 750‚Äì775, probably in Bayeux, where he had been bishop and was venerated from an early date.Vita Sancti Vigoris Born in Artois, he studied at Arras under Saint Vedast. His noble father, preoccupied with worldly prestige, would not grant approval for him to become a priest, so he ran away from home, taking nothing with him, accompanied by an acolyte, Theodimir. Thereafter, he became a hermit preacher at Reviers, Calvados,ad vicum quemdam qui vocatur Redeveris (Vita). and worked as a missionary. Saint Vigor was named bishop of Bayeux in 514. He fervently opposed paganism and founded a monastery, later known as Saint-Vigor-le-Grand. In Bayeux, Normandy, he destroyed a pagan temple that was still in use and built a church on the grounds. Veneration In Normandy, Vigor was venerated and churches are dedicated to him. Normandy was the site for the establishment of his cult after the successful Norman conquest of England. Two English churches have been dedicated to Vigor; one in Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, the other in Stratton-on-the-Fosse, Somerset. His feast falls on All Saints' Day (November 1), and as a result is often moved to another date. Saint Vigor is mentioned in the life (vita) of Saint Paternus.

Listed at , 185 lb., Hoderlein was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He was born in Mount Carmel, Ohio. A steady infielder with good instincts, Hoderlein is better known as a player who was part of seven major league franchises but only played for two of them. At age 28, it was a long way for Hoderlein, who spent four years of active military service and six seasons in the minors playing for the Reds, Cubs, Yankees and Red Sox systems (1941, 1946‚Äì50). Hoderlein joined the U.S. Air Force during World War II (1942‚Äì45). After being discharged, he was part of several transactions before debuting in the majors in August 1951 with the Red Sox, while hitting .357 (5-for-14) in nine games. Before the 1952 season, he was traded by Boston with Chuck Stobbs to the White Sox in the same transaction that brought Randy Gumpert to Boston. But Hoderlein did not appear in a game for the White Sox. He was sent immediately along with Jim Busby to the Senators in exchange for Sam Mele. Hoderlein gave three years of good services for Washington, coming out of the bench as a defensive replacement and for pinch-hitting duties. In the 1954 midseason he was dealt to the Tigers for Johnny Pesky, but he decided to finally hang his spikes. In a four-season career, Hoderlein was a .252 hitter (74-for-294) with 22 runs and 24 RBI in 118 games, including 10 doubles, three triples, two stolen bases, and a .327 on-base percentage. He did not hit a home run. He made 88 infield appearances at second base (77), shortstop (8) and third base (3), committing 14 errors in 423 chances for a collective .967 fielding percentage. Hoderlein died in his hometown of Mount Carmel, Ohio at age 77. Fact *On May 29, 1952, Red Sox pitcher Mickey McDermott faced 27 batters and fired a one-hitter to beat the Senators, 1‚Äì0, at Fenway Park. Hoderlein's fourth inning single was the only Washington's hit and he was thrown out while trying to stretch the hit into a double.

Whippingham railway station is a former railway station near Whippingham on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. It was arguably the most underused station on an often sparsely used Island network. It was built solely because of the need to have a station within reasonable proximity to Queen Victoria's Island residence Osborne House, and it is known that Queen Victoria did use the station on at least one occasion, on 11 February 1888, when she travelled from Whippingham to Ventnor and back for the opening of the National Consumption Hospital there. The station is also known to have been used by the young Lord Mountbatten.Marjorie Smith, daughter of the stationmaster between 1917 and 1925- quoted in In its early days its passenger carrying status was ambiguous and, although always clean and tidy, it was never very busy. A passing loop was added in 1912 and indeed was retained for a further three years after closure in 1953. Trains continued to pass through the station until the line was closed in 1966. The station house, now a private dwelling, still stands, with the only other building within any sort of close proximity being the Island crematorium. The old railway track at the location is now a public footpath and cycle track. The station was described in the Railway Magazine: > Few people know that the delightfully rural station of Whippingham, in the > Isle of Wight, was originally built to be a private station, though now it > may be said to have become quite a public one. The station is near the > charming village which was so dear to the heart of her late Majesty Queen > Victoria, and, when it was first planned it was intended that the station > should be kept exclusively for the use of the Queen, the Roval family, or > visitors to Osborne. But with her usual kindness of heart and thoughtfulness > for her humblest dependents, Queen Victoria soon saw what a boon it would be > for the surrounding tenantry and villagers to be able to use Whippingham > Station, rather than to have to go to Cowes or Newport, and then return for > miles to their homes. So she graciously allowed her private station to be > used by almost everybody who wished, until at length it became a really > public station. It would indeed be difficult to find a more lovely spot than > Whippingham. or a nicer station for a country village than is the one there. > It has seen many historic sights, too; being probably the only private > railway station‚Äîin our time‚Äîthat can boast of such renown. Royalties from > far and near have here detrained: men and women famous over the world have > trodden its platform when visiting or leaving the great Qeeen of England; it > has witnessed the joy of marriages and the pain of deaths amongst the Royal > family in a way no other station has done.

The depot was nominated for being an essential conduit for the arrival of goods and people and the export of iron ore during central Crow Wing County's economic boom years. The building now serves as the Soo Line Depot Museum, operated by the Cuyuna Iron Range Heritage Network. History The Crosby Soo Line Depot initially served as a train station for the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway (later the Soo Line Railroad starting in 1961). The station was part of a project conducted from 1908 to 1910 to build a rail line from Superior, Wisconsin, to Thief River Falls, Minnesota, along with a branch through Crosby to access the Cuyuna Range iron mines.

It was broadcast on the ABC network on March 30, 1966, in an hour slot (including commercials). The songs were written by composer Charles Strouse and lyricist Lee Adams, who were most famous for Bye Bye Birdie. The songs were orchestrated by Marty Paich, who also provided musical direction; plus devised and arranged that part of the underscoring that was drawn from the musical numbers. The rest of the underscoring was drawn from the vast library of cues that Hanna-Barbera's in-house composer Hoyt Curtin had written for various animated series. Storyline This adaptation of the 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is essentially, and very intentionally, a modern riff on the classic tale: while trying to read the original Lewis Carroll book for a book report, Alice tries to fend off her little white dog Fluff, who is in a very playful mood, and tosses a ball for him to chase. It bounces toward and magically through the living room TV screen‚Äîand Fluff, in hot pursuit, disappears right after it. Alice goes after Fluff and of course winds up falling through herself, and entering Wonderland. Characters With this being Wonderland through the \\"looking glass\\" of a TV screen, the creative team had all the excuse they needed to reinterpret all the iconic Wonderland characters as TV celebrities. In some cases, this merely involved a celebrity voice and persona: Howard Morris lent the shy, sweet, impish persona he had often employed in sketch comedy (most famously in Your Show of Shows) to the White Rabbit. Harvey Korman brought his take on effete eccentricity to the Mad Hatter. Perhaps most transparently, Zsa Zsa Gabor played a glamorous Queen of Hearts replete with Hungarian accent and a penchant for calling people \\"darling\\". And perhaps most famously, Sammy Davis, Jr. assayed the Cheshire Cat as a groovy, rockin', swingin' feline beatnik. =Cameos= There were some celebrity cameos too: Fred Flintstone (voiced by Alan Reed speaking, Henry Corden singing) and Barney Rubble (voiced by Mel Blanc) literally play themselves as the Caterpillar, which is re-interpreted as two veteran vaudevillians in a caterpillar costume with heads on either end (the neckline of each respective head opening mimics their costumes from The Flintstones: Fred's has a necktie and Barney's features the signature cross-stitching of his tunic). Bill Dana's portrayal of the White Knight is a manifestation of Jose Jimenez, the Hispanic immigrant character he perfected in standup routines and on sitcoms (very likely this interpretation of the White Knight was also a comic nod to the most unlikely and famous fictional knight-errant of all, the Spanish novelist Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote). Character actor Allan Melvin provided a voice inspired by Humphrey Bogart for the \\"hard- boiled\\" criminal egg, Humphrey Dumpty. And Hedda Hatter (a new character who pops into the Mad Tea Party at the behest of the Mad Hatter) is voiced by gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. It would be her last \\"public appearance\\"; she died two months prior to the film's initial broadcast. Broadcast history Rexall and Coca-Cola sponsored this feature, and characters from the movie appeared in the Rexall commercials (the playing time of the film as reported here does not include the commercials, which are neither part of the narrative nor the work of the core creative team). The show was repeated on ABC primetime only once, a year later, and has occasionally, rarely been rebroadcast since, most recently on Cartoon Network. To date, it has never been officially released on home video in any format (though unofficial digital transfers can be found). Audio adaptation After the movie was broadcast, Hanna-Barbera Records did commercially release a vinyl LP, whose content is likewise currently out of print, which is often misidentified as a soundtrack album but is in fact a completely (or nearly-completely) re- recorded audio adaptation, with a largely different cast, somewhat abridged (six minutes shorter, though it can be argued that the cuts are not quite so severe, as they also condense some purely visual action sequences), employing much re-worked dialogue to aid the compression and to fill in for absent visuals (occasionally leading to radically rewritten scenes that cover the same dramatic territory, in particular the first White Rabbit sequence), and a slightly reduced orchestration of the songs (i.e. the shape and substance of the arrangements are essentially the same, but reconceived for and played by a smaller orchestra, lacking the TV show's harp, jazz organ [featured in the title song] and somewhat fuller complement of strings, brass and winds. The identical-sounding performances of the songs They'll Never Split Us Apart and Today's a Wonderful Day do, however, suggest that a certain small amount of soundtrack material may have been inserted for expedience). It is likely that Bill Dana's teleplay was adapted for records by Charles Shows, a ubiquitous and major animation writer of the period, who wrote most of the story albums produced by Hanna-Barbera Records, and retains his usual \\"stories\\" credit on the back of the album cover. There has never been a second printing, re- release or digital release of the album. (It bears noting that there was indeed a limited release, one-sided soundtrack LP of the songs only, exactly as heard on the special, performed by the original TV cast, distributed to industry professionals as a promotional item for the show and its sponsor Rexall.) =Audio cast changes= Where Sammy Davis Jr. supplied the speaking and singing voice of the Cheshire Cat in the movie, he was constrained from appearing in the audio adaptation because he was under exclusive contract to Reprise Records at the time; but Scatman Crothers provides the vinyl voice of the Cat, giving a rendition of the character and the title song that is at least as delightfully hip and funky. Where others of the TV show cast were concerned, there may have been additional issues involving contracts and royalties, because except for Bill Dana, all of the original celebrity performers were likewise replaced on the album by actors from Hanna-Barbera's stable of reliable A+ voice over actors: Don Messick voiced the White Rabbit (replacing Howard Morris with a performance obviously intended to be as close an imitation as possible); Henry Corden not only reprised Fred Flintstone's singing voice, but assumed his speaking voice as well (replacing Alan Reed; and, indeed, he would officially take over the voice of Fred in 1977 after Reed's death); the character of Hedda Hatter was cut, her material combined with that of the Mad Hatter, and the latter was voiced by Daws Butler (replacing Harvey Korman); and with Butler assuming the Hatter, Mel Blanc moved into Butler's previous role as the March Hare. Janet Waldo, the speaking voice of Alice, does uncredited double duty as the Queen of Hearts, via a better-acted impression of her predecessor Zsa Zsa Gabor.

They are latterly best known for their English language cover of Serge Gainsbourg's song \\"Harley David (Son of a Bitch)\\" (originally in French) and Alex Harvey's \\"Faith Healer\\". As well as being renowned for their self penned creations such as \\"Horror Movies\\", \\"The Bunker\\", \\"The Legend Of The Snake\\" and \\"The Slow Removal of The Left Ear of Vincent van Gogh\\" which featured Martin Glover of the band Killing Joke, they are known for their release of cover versions by artists as diverse as Led Zeppelin, The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Steppenwolf, David Bowie and Vangelis among others. Always on the lookout for clever publicity, their 1983 electro version of the Sex Pistols' album Never Mind The Bollocks featured Michael Fagan, the man who entered the Queen's bedchamber at Buckingham Palace. Jimmy Lydon, brother of Johnny Rotten, was a featured vocalist for a short while in the early 1980s. In 1994, Croydon-based DJ Andy Hubbard aka \\"Alby\\" remixed \\"Faith Healer\\" at the Alaska Studios in Waterloo, London. The record was never released and the original DAT copy was held by Jock McDonald. Andy Hubbard also replaced the original keyboard player for a gig later that year in Wuppertal, Germany. Having released nine studio albums as well as many other EPs, singles, live releases and compilations the band continues to be a live draw throughout Europe although primarily in Belgium, Germany and France.

The basic concept applied for collective protection is overpressure and filtration. By filtering the incoming air to the shelter or protected space and maintaining higher internal air pressure than the external pressure, the contaminated external air is prevented from infiltrating the shelter or protected space and results in a toxic free area (TFA) for work and relief from wearing MOPP equipment.

They were among the first well-defined worker uprisings of the period known as the Industrial Revolution. The First Canut revolt in 1831 was provoked by a bad economy and a resultant drop in silk prices, which caused a drop in workers' wages. In an effort to maintain their standard of living, the workers tried to see a minimum price imposed on silk. The refusal of the manufacturers to pay this price infuriated the workers, who went into open revolt. They seized the arsenal and repulsed the local national guard and military in a bloody battle, which left the insurgents in control of the town. The government sent Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, at the head of an army of 20,000 to restore order. Soult was able to retake the town without any bloodshed, and without making any compromises with the workers. Though some workers were arrested, all were eventually acquitted. The revolt ended, with the minimum price abolished and with the workers no better off. The Second Canut revolt in 1834 occurred in a prosperous economy that had caused a surge in workers' wages. Owners saw these wages as too high, so they attempted to impose a wage decrease. This combined with laws that oppressed Republican groups caused the workers to rebel. The government crushed the rebellion in a bloody battle and deported or imprisoned 10,000 insurgents. A third insurrection occurred in 1848. Although it was as violent and was motivated by almost identical worker exploitation, 1848 was a year of revolution all over Europe and it did not acquire the same renown as that of 1831. Indeed, the revolt of 1831 encouraged many other worker revolts of the 19th century. Silk industry in Lyon at the beginning of the 19th century A Jacquard loom. At the beginning of the 19th century, the textile industry was the main industrial activity of Lyon and the surrounding region. The livelihood of half of the population of Lyon was dependent on the silk weaving industry. In 1831, the production of silk goods in Lyon was still organised in a manner similar to that of the pre-industrial era: *At the top of the socio- economic pyramid was the grande fabrique (literally great manufacture), a group of about 1,400 bankers and traders named (manufacturers) or (silkers), who controlled and financed the manufacture and commercialisation of the goods. Grande encyclop√©die Larousse, 1972, p.2282-83 *The manufacturers contracted about 8,000 chief weaving craftsmen, the canuts, who were paid either for a specific order or per piece. The Canuts owned their own looms, generally between 2 and 6, depending on the size of the workshop. *The Canuts employed about 30,000 apprentices, who were paid by the day, but generally lived with the canut, who lodged and fed them, and with whom they shared a similar standard of living. *Women were also employed at a lesser salary, as were apprentices and errand boys. These workers filled a wide variety of professions: (mechanics who repair and adjust the looms), satinaires (women who prepare the satin), battandiers (who make the tools necessary for the weaving), metteurs en carte (who make the coded tables indicating the colour and characteristics of the silk to be used, according to the drawing provided by the customer), liseurs (who create the perforated cards for the Jacquard loom), magnanerelles (women working in the magnaneries‚Äîsilk-raising farms), warpers are the \\"ourdisseuses\\", embroiderers, silk folders, spinners, ourdisseuses (women who prepare the warp of the piece to be woven prior to it being placed on the loom), dyers, etc. While most of the workshops were situated in houses in the arrondissement of Pentes de la Croix-Rousse, some were also located in Saint-Georges, in Vieux Lyon, Bourgneuf, La Guilloti√®re and Vaise. There was only one industrial grade factory, the silk factory of la Sauvag√®re, employing 600 workers, in Saint-Rambert-l'√éle-Barbe. The value of silk, as with any luxury product, depended on the economy. A large portion of the demand was from North America, and was very susceptible to competition and change. During the First French Empire, the government accepted, or at least tolerated, the price fixing done in Lyon. The increased revenue from price fixing allowed greater salaries throughout the system. After the economic crisis of 1825, with the support of Catholic royalists, the canuts and their companions had created mutual assistance societies.  First revolt  Depiction of the fighting in the streets of Lyon in front of Saint-Nizier church during the 1831 revolt The grim condition of the economy in 1831 drastically reduced the demand for silk goods. Salaries were continually being reduced, much less than their maximum during the economically prosperous years of the First French Empire. On 18 October 1831, the canuts asked the prefect of the department of the Rh√¥ne, Louis Bouvier-Dumolart, to help them negotiate with the manufacturers. The canuts wanted a fixed price to be established, which would stop the further decrease of the price of silk goods. The prefect organised a group of owners and workers, which was able to establish a fixed rate on 26 October. A labour court, the Conseil de prud'hommes, was given the role of ensuring the rate was applied. The intervention of the prefect was, however, poorly received by some manufacturers who considered his actions to be demagogic, and the concessions afforded by their representatives to be a sign of weakness. 104 of them refused to apply the rate, claiming it was against the principles of the French Revolution. Laws such as the Le Chapelier Law and the Allarde decree of 1791 established the principle of economic non- intervention by the state, in addition to explicitly banning guilds (a predecessor to trade unions), and denying the right to strike. The manufacturers claimed the fixed rate was contrary to freedom of enterprise. On 10 November, they rejected the salary claims of the canuts, which they considered to be exorbitant. This attitude infuriated much of the working class. = Insurrection = On 21 November 1831 several hundred weavers toured the then independent commune of Croix-Rousse. They forced the few weavers still at work to close their workshops, harassing the National Guard. Soon after they erected barricades and marched to Lyon with the anarchistic black flag. On 22 November in Lyon, the workers captured the fortified police barracks at Bon-Pasteur, pillaging the arsenal and stealing weapons in the process. Several units of the military guard and the national guard were attacked. The infantry attempted to stop them, but was forced to retreat under a hail of tiles and bullets. The national guard, most of which was recruited from amongst the canuts, changed sides, joining the insurgents. After a bloody battle which caused about 600 casualties (100 dead, 263 injured on the military side, 69 dead, 140 injured on the civilian side), the insurgents captured the town. During the night of 22-23 November, General Roguet, commander of the 7th division and mayor Victor Prunelle fled the town. The insurgents occupied the town hall. At this point, the leaders of the workers were unsure as to the further course of action, having started the strike with the sole intention of making sure the fixed rate on silken goods was being applied correctly. A few republicans in the group insisted on using the momentum to form a governmental committee. The committee did not make any definite decisions, due to a lack of agenda. Not helping the committee's effectiveness was the canuts' refusal to have their insurrection used for political purposes. = Return of order = Louis-Philippe I, King of the French. In Paris, the news of the riot and the occupation of France's second largest city caused astonishment and consternation. Debate raged in the Chamber of deputies and the opposition, led by Fran√ßois Mauguin, seized the opportunity to decry the incompetence of the ministers. The President of the Council of Ministers, Casimir Perier, whose government's first goal was to re- establish order after the July Revolution, thought otherwise. He blamed the troubles in Lyon on Saint-Simonianist propaganda and political manoeuvres by supporters of Charles X. King Louis-Philippe himself was quite sure that the problems were caused by republican actions. General Baudrand, aide de camp of Crown Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans, wrote: \\"Poverty... [...] there are many exaggerations in what is said about it. It has been worse in other times and did not produce such results,\\" which probably represented opinion in the Tuileries Palace.Antonetti 674 On 25 November, Perier announced that Crown Prince Ferdinand Philippe, and Marshal Nicholas Soult, Minister of War and formerly one of Napoleon's most renowned marshals, would command an army of 20,000 soldiers to retake Lyon. King Louis-Philippe asked them to be strict, but to avoid the use of capital punishment. On 29 November 1831, he wrote to Soult: \\"The important point [...] is to enter Lyon without suffering any [major] blows and without agreeing to any conditions. [...] You will need to be strict. [...] [Y]et you know that when I say strict, I do not refer to execution , and it is not to you that I need say this.\\"Antonetti 673 Louis- Philippe was very critical of the prefect, writing: \\"It is very clear, in my opinion, that he had a previously formed agreement with the leaders, and that he was not acting loyally to his government before the events.\\" He nonetheless was cautious on the topic of the fixed rate, writing to his son: \\"The fixed rate is a delicate point on which I believe we must tread lightly and carefully weigh what we do. I can not give further advice because I lack sufficient information. You must say as little on the subject as possible.\\" Marshal Soult. On 28 November, the duke of Orl√©ans and Marshal Soult stopped at Tr√©voux, where they waited for order to return in Lyon. They entered the city on 3 December without any blood being shed and with no negotiation or agreements being made. The fixed rate was abolished, the prefect dismissed, the national guard disbanded, and a large garrison positioned in the town. The government decided to build a fort to separate the commune of Croix-Rousse from the town of Lyon. 90 workers were arrested, 11 of whom were prosecuted and acquitted in June 1832. Soult informed the king of the success of his mission, attributing all the praise to \\"recognition of the king and the prince\\" and, where it was lacking, to an \\"expression of sadness which was obviously a testimony of repentance.\\" He noted that all the authorities came to \\"pay homage to His Highness,\\" and that all had prepared very good speeches, with the exception of the archbishop, Jean Paul Gaston de Pins,(De Pins, 1822‚Äì1824, was named in 1824 the apostolic administrator of the archdiocese of Lyon and received at this occasion the title of archbishop of Amasia in partibus infidelium. The official archbishop remained cardinal Joseph Fesch, uncle of Napoleon I, who had refused to resign and lived in Rome. who was content saying he had \\"nothing but prayers to offer.\\" From 17 to 20 December 1831, the far left opposition parties tried to bring the situation in Lyon back to the forefront in the Chamber of Deputies. Casimir Perier declared that the revolt had wanted to arm itself \\"against the freedom of commerce and industry,\\" and affirmed on 26 December that \\"society will not let itself be threatened with impunity\\". The cabinet's motion was passed quickly by a large majority, continuing to the day's agenda despite the protests and demand for an enquiry by the far left.  Second revolt  After the failure of the 1831 revolt, the Parisian republicans sent agents to Lyon. They were able to create a large network of secret societies, often working closely with labour associations for silk craftsmen. At the end of 1833, good economic prospects and conditions caused a boom in the Lyonnais silk industry. As a result, the government thought the chances of a second revolt extremely unlikely. The Interior Minister, the Count of Argout, wrote to the king on 9 September 1833: \\"I have just received M. Fulchiron, who comes from Lyon. The manufacture is in a state of simply fabulous prosperity. The orders from America are immense. The workers earn 6 to 7 francs per day. This is too much. They are, however, in a state of tranquillity as one may easily conceive.\\"Antonetti 720 On 1 February 1834, an attempt by a few hundred Italian, German and Polish revolutionaries from Geneva and Grenoble was made to start a republican coup in Savoy. D'Argout told the king: \\"They are Savoyards who have recently come to Grenoble, and a few French republicans. M. de Gasparin writes to me that 1,200 inhabitants of Lyon had made plans to support the movement in Savoy should it have succeeded.\\" The republicans intended to create a revolutionary climate, taking advantage of a salary conflict caused by high worker wages. In February 1834, owners began to agree that workers' salaries had increased too much, and they began an attempt to impose a reduction. The results of this were conflict and strikes, the leaders of which were arrested and tried. Their trial began on 5 April, while the Chamber of Peers were discussing a law which would intensify the repression of republican groups. The Republicans managed to amalgamate several political parties to fall within the scope of this law, as did the mutual workers' associations to which Lyon's canuts belonged. As a result, thousands of craftsmen rebelled on 9 April. The leaders proclaimed daily agendas, which they dated not \\"9 April 1834,\\" but instead \\"22 Germinal, year XLII of the Republic,\\" using the French Republican Calendar. The bombardment of Brunet House in Croix-Rousse. Oil on canvas. The army occupied the town and bridges. Soon after, gunfire began, with troops firing on an unarmed crowd. Barricades were erected quickly throughout the town to hinder the army's progress. The disorganised workers stormed the Bon-Pasteur barracks, the same as during the first revolt, and again plundered the arsenal. The workers barricaded the different districts of the city, including Croix-Rousse, effectively creating fortified camps. What would be known later as the Sanglante semaine (bloody week) had begun. Adolphe Thiers, the Interior minister, would use a tactic that he would later reuse in 1871 to defeat the Paris Commune: retreat from the town, abandon it to the insurgents, surround it, then take it back. On 10 April, more shots were exchanged between the insurgents and the troops. The workers occupied the telegraph office, the Guilloti√®re quarter, and then the nearby city of Villeurbanne where military barracks were captured. Black flags were flown over the arrondissements Fourvi√®re, Saint-Nizier and Antiquaille. Fighting continued on 11 April; Croix Rousse was bombarded by the recently reinforced military, while revolts started in the more distant cities of Saint-√âtienne and Vienne. On 12 April, the troops attacked and re-took the Guilloti√®re quarter, after having destroyed numerous houses by artillery. On 14 April, the army reconquered the town piece by piece, attacking Croix-Rousse for the third time. 15 April was the end of the Sanglante semaine in Lyon, the second canut rebellion having been suppressed. Conservative estimates of the number of casualties were between 100 and 200,Antonetti 722 while more liberal estimates were more than 600. 10,000 captured insurgents were tried in a \\"gigantic trial\\" in Paris during April 1835, and were condemned to deportation or strict prison sentences. The July Monarchy suspected the intrigues of other groups, such as legitimists or Bonapartists, at work, which accounted for the harsh repression of the revolt.  Third revolt  A third insurrection occurred in 1848. Although it was as violent and was motivated by almost identical worker conditions, 1848 was a year of revolution all over Europe and it did not acquire the same renown as that of 1831. Indeed, the revolt of 1831 encouraged many other worker revolts of the 19th century. Consequences In 1836 the Rive-de-Gier poet Guillaume Roquille wrote , an account of the revolt in the Franco-Proven√ßal language. Although it was apparently accurate, he was prosecuted for his publication. The canut revolts caused the emergence of a sense of shared interests in workers' communities. It began an era of social claims, that would be accentuated by the living conditions of the workers during this time of emerging capitalism, as attested by the famous memoirs of doctor Louis Ren√© Villerm√© at the Acad√©mie des sciences morales et politiques. They later influenced the rebellion that resulted in the brief Paris Commune,Edwards, Stewart [1971]. The Paris Commune 1871. London: Eyre & Spottiswoode. . pg. 1 which in turn influenced much of the socialist, communist and anarchistic philosophies of the present. In 1834, Franz Liszt wrote the piano piece \\"Lyon\\" from his collection Album d'un voyageur (S.156), which contains a motto from that time: \\"Vivre en travaillant ou mourir en combattant.\\" He dedicated the piece to Lemannais.

The band's sound contains elements of indie rock with classic rock, soul music, jazz, folk music and modern rock. The Oaks have gained international attention through their original fusion of music performance and humanitarian aid. Costello spent two years in Afghanistan, living among recently returned refugees, teaching agricultural techniques and directly participating in food distributions. When he returned to the United States, he vowed to get the word out about the need of the Afghan people. The Oaks is the result of these aspirations. Biography Costello and Antolick met as students at the University of South Florida. They played together in the project \\"Figure vs Ground\\" before relocating to suburban Orlando and creating The Oaks. Costello was pursuing a BA in Biology, while Antolick was working on his Master's in Philosophy and teaching Environmental Ethics. In 2003, The OaKs' Ryan Costello sold everything he owned, joined a humanitarian organization and moved to Afghanistan. Costello lived there for two years, working in the Central Afghan mountains with returned refugees, teaching them creative agricultural techniques and becoming fluent in their native language, Dari (Persian). In 2005, Costello returned to the United States, reuniting with his long-time creative partner, The OaKs' drummer Matthew Antolick. Costello and Antolick collaborated to create the band's first CD, \\"Our Fathers and The Things They Left Behind\\", lyrically inspired mostly by Costello's time spent in Afghanistan. The duo released the album independently in late summer 2006. They also partnered with Global Hope Network ‚Äì an organization dedicated to helping impoverished refugees in Afghanistan ‚Äì pledging 50% of CD and download sales towards their cause. The self-released album was completely home recorded by the pair, mixed by Martin Feveyear of Jupiter Studios, Seattle (Modest Mouse, Damien Jurado), and mastered by Alan Douches of West West Side Music, NY (Sufjan Stevens). Their diverse mix of instruments includes accordion, mandolin, bells, vibraphone, horns, assorted percussion, electronic organ and Wurlitzer, to name a few. Costello's lyrics range from self-examination to social critique. His songs are often about self-sacrificing figures such as Hugh Thompson\\"For Hugh Thompson, Who Stood Alone\\" on the album Our Fathers and the Things They Left Behind. and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and he pulls inspiration from the Southern Gothic fiction of Flannery O'Conner and Carson McCullers. In the winter of 2006, Costello and Antolick decided to expand the band, with the purposes of live performance and adding more outside influences to their established sound. After some trial and error, the band solidified their roster to include keyboardist Tim Cocking, lead guitarist Greg Willson, backup vocalist Melissa Reyes, and bassist Jeremy Siegel.

The station's primary channel is a classical music station simulcasting WCRB from Boston. It serves the Providence area. WJMF also operates an HD2 channel run by Bryant University students; from 1973 until 2011, this service was heard on its primary channel. The station has over 40 shows and more than 100 DJs. It plays a variety of music ranging from alternative to talk to Top 40. It is also known for hosting local political debates, interviews with athletes, and having talk radio shows. It also broadcasts games of the Bryant University Division I athletic teams. On April 27, 2012, WJMF was granted a U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) construction permit to increase its effective radiated power (ERP) up to 1,500 Watts. The directional pattern of the antenna will be changed. The construction permit expired on April 27, 2015. History WJMF began at the Bryant College Providence, R.I. campus. The original frequency was 91.5 MHz. Because of the efforts of Dr. Barry Fullerton and Bryant student/WJMF General Manager Stephen Boulter, WJMF was launched at the Bryant campus. Its constitution was drafted in 1972 and in November 1973, the radio station began broadcasting from the Bryant College Unistructure. The station has been student-run from its founding. The station began broadcasting in mono, and was powered at 10 watts. In 1977, the station began broadcasting in stereo. When the station received approval to increase its operating power from 10 to 225 watts, the FCC required the station to change its frequency from 91.5 to 88.7 MHz. On Thursday, May 14, 1981, the station began operating out of the Bryant College Multipurpose Activity Center (MAC). President William T. O‚ÄôHara presided over the release of 225 balloons in front of the MAC to celebrate the station's new location and new operating power. In early 1989, General Manager Don Desfosse announced that the station had simultaneously added its 2000th vinyl record album, and its first compact disc (CD) player. Just a few months later, Desfosse added a new sound console (sound board), moving the 1970s-era sound board to the production studio, and added two new commercial-broadcast- grade CD players to the on-air studio. A blue neon light has sat in the window of WJMF studios since 1991. It a symbol of the station's location and on-air time, and a tribute to the memory of Michael T. Cain. Cain was killed at the cliff walks in Newport, RI. He was the WJMF general manager who oversaw the purchase of the neon sign. The project was completed after his death. An official sign lighting took place with the Cain family present. In the 1990s, with student enrollment down at colleges and universities worldwide, Bryant closed three of its residence halls. WJMF moved from the MAC to Residence Hall 6. During the summer of 2004, WJMF moved its studios from Hall 6 to its current location in the Koffler Technology Center. During the winter of 2005-2006 WJMF went through an extensive equipment upgrade, with the addition of two new sound boards from Harris Communications, mic processing, delay system, remote broadcast capabilities, ENCO automation system and new outdoor speakers. Bryant College has hosted WJMF's 20th, 30th and 40th birthday parties. At the 20th in 1992, Don Desfosse (General Manager 1988-1991) returned with then-General Manager Dave Kaplan on the main floor of the Bryant Center, with WJMF operating remotely from the site. At the 30th birthday party, in 2002, current station members took alumni on a tour of the station's facilities in Hall 6, followed by a formal dinner, dessert and coffee party in the Papitto Dining Room of the Bryant Center. The 40th Birthday Party was held on April 21, 2012, where alumni and family members were able to tour the station's facilities in the Koffler Center and Communications Complex, witness the unveiling of the On-Air Studio blue wall (which was dedicated to alumnus Stephen Boulter) and the WJMF History Wall, go online, and have a barbecue. Updates Koffler Communication Complex went through an extensive equipment upgrade during the Winter of 2005-2006. With the addition of two new sound boards from Harris Communications, Mic Processing, Delay System, Remote Broadcast Capabilities, Online streaming, an ENCO Automation System, Outdoor Speakers and a fully redecorated office, production studio and on-air studio. WJMF now broadcasts in stereo. In 2010, the radio station experienced more upgrades thanks to Bryant University's Special Initiatives Funding Program. The initiatives gave WJMF over $10,000 worth of new equipment including a digitized EAS System, Production Systems, RCS Music Scheduling Software and increased security. WJMF has another pending request for a full simulcasting system. WJMF's last logo before its partnership with WGBH The station was converted to a simulcast of Boston classical music station WCRB in August 2011, under a deal between Bryant University and the WGBH Educational Foundation. WJMF also boosted power from 225 watts to 1,200 watts (allowing for better coverage of Providence) and commence HD Radio operations; WJMF's programming was transferred to a new HD2 channel, as well as a mobile television subchannel of WGBH-TV. Providence had been one of the largest markets without a full-time classical music station, particularly after WCRB moved from 102.5 FM to 99.5 FM in 2006. Along with this, WJMF will up its current online streaming methods in terms of capability and speed. WJMF will also be developing mobile applications that will connect to an online stream. With the partnership with WGBH, WJMF will be exposed to a variety of internship opportunities with WGBH and its networks. WJMF will continue to be student run and offer quality variety programming. Spring Stock Spring Stock is one of two major annual events that WJMF holds. During Spring Weekend at Bryant, WJMF works closely with the Student Programming Board to create a day of events based on music and entertainments. WJMF's headliner was Zox and SPB's headliners were Everclear and Young Joc. Held Hostage Held Hostage is a 36 hours DJing marathon where popular DJs spend the entire 36 hours in the station raising money for a non-profit organization of WJMF's choosing. In 2010 and 2011, the non-profit organization was the Rhode Island Community Food Bank.

It is in the civil parish of Ellingham, Harbridge and Ibsley. Ellingham is most famous for the story of Alice Lisle, who was executed by the infamous Judge Jeffreys in 1685, on the charge of harbouring fugitives after the defeat of the Monmouth Rebellion. Overview Ellingham is a small village near Ringwood in Hampshire. It contains the hamlet of Rockford, and Moyles Court, the large house which is now a school. The village and surrounding countryside are a large tourist attraction in the summer months. Much of the area around Ellingham was once farmland and woodland, but since the 1950s sand and gravel extraction has created a series of lakes known collectively as Blashford Lakes.Blashford Lakes , Hampshire & Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust These lakes now separate Ellingham church from the rest of the former parish around Rockford and Moyles Court. Alice Lisle has an inn named after her in Rockford. Ellingham was a civil parish until 1974, when the parish was amalgamated with the parishes of Harbridge and Ibsley.

It then passed by descent into the Okeden family who held it until the middle of the 17th century. William Beconshaw died seised of the manor in 1634‚Äì5. His son, Sir White Beconshaw, died in 1638, and it passed to his two daughters, Elizabeth wife of Thomas Tipping and Alice Lisle wife of John Lisle. In 1658 a final settlement by which Ellingham passed to the Lisles was ratified by William Okeden. John Lisle was assassinated while in exile in Switzerland in 1664, for his part in the execution of Charles I. Alice Lisle, who lived in the Elizabethan house of Moyles Court, was one of the victims of the infamous Judge Jeffreys.Ellingham, Harbridge and Ibsley , www3.hants.gov.uk Charged with harbouring fugitives after the defeat of the Monmouth Rebellion at the Battle of Sedgemoor, she was executed in 1685. Ellingham remained in the Lisle family until the death of Charles Lisle, who died unmarried in 1818. His nephew Edward Hayles Taylor, who took the name of Lisle in 1822, sold the manor soon afterwards to the Earl of Normanton, whose family seat was (and still is) at nearby Somerley. Moyles Court Moyles Court Moyles Court was the house of the manor of Rockford. Rockford is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was held by Hugh of St Quentin, but by the 13th century it had passed to the Moels family and Rockford stayed in that family until the death of John de Moels in 1337. In the 17th century Rockford passed, like Ellingham, to the Lisle family. Moyles Court (named after the 13th-century family) in Rockford became their chief residence. Alice Lisle continued to live at Moyles Court after her husband's assassination until her own notorious trial and execution in 1685. In the 19th century Moyles Court was sold to the Earl of Normanton with Ellingham. Moyles Court is now used as a school - Moyles Court School. The 18th-Century building which has become \\"The Alice Lisle Inn\\" was formerly the village school for Rockford. Ellingham church Ellingham church was built in the 13th century.Saint Mary's Church - Pastscape It is thought that there was an earlier, probably Saxon, church on the site.Hampshire Treasures Volume 5 (New Forest) Page 103 It is described in early charters as the church of St Mary or as the church of All Saints with the chapel of St Mary. It was added to in the 15th century, and the red-brick west wall was rebuilt in 1746. The church was restored 1869-90 by Thomas Graham Jackson.

Following World War II and the fall of Fascism, the newly established Italian Republic officially abolished titles and hereditary honours in its 1946 Constitution, with the exception of the papal nobility of Rome (fourteen families amongst which are the Ruspolis), insofar as they had been created by the Pope. All its members hold the title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire. The origins of the family can be traced back to the Ruspoli of Florence in the 13th century and more remotely from Marius Scotus in the 8th century and his descendants the Marescottis of Bologna. In the 16th century the Ruspolis moved to Rome where the last descendant, Vittoria Ruspoli, Marchioness of Cerveteri, married Sforza Vicino Marescotti Count of Vignanello, a descendant of the Farnese family on both his mother's and father's side. One of Vittoria's sons took the Ruspoli name and coat of arms to guarantee the continuity of the house. In 1708, Vittoria's grandson, Francesco Ruspoli head of the Ruspoli Regiment fought to defend the Papal States. In 1709 he forced the Austrians to a retreat and Pope Clement XI named Francesco Maria Ruspoli first Prince of Cerveteri. Title which would then pass down to the first born of each generation. The papal title of Roman Prince was later conferred in 1721 also to be held by the first born of each generation. Since 1808 the head of the family is also to serve as Grand Master of the Sacred Apostolic Hospice, which was an hereditary official of the Pontifical Household. He was a Participating Privy Chamberlains and the sole lay member of the Noble Privy Antechamber, as well as a Participating Privy Chamberlains of the Sword and Cape (who were all laymen, traditionally holding hereditary posts). The post was removed in the reforms of the Papal Curia after 1968 leaving just the honorific title. History = The Ruspoli Origins= There are traces of members of the Ruspoli family from the 13th century on the tomb stones in the churches of Ognisanti and of Santa Maria Novella in Florence. Some of its members, in chronological order: * Lorenzo Ruspoli ‚Äì Florentine noble ‚Äî lived in the early 13th century. * Neri Ruspoli ‚Äì chief Ghibellin ‚Äì in 1266 the Guelphs burned down his house in Florence. * Ser Bonaccorso Ruspoli ‚Äî notary in Florence and Ghino Ruspoli ‚Äî lived in 1304 * Roberto Ruspoli ‚Äî lived mid-14th century * Giovanni Ruspoli ‚Äì born in 1363 ‚Äì Gonfaloniere and prior in 1391 ‚Äî built the Gentilizia chapel in Ognissanti Church. * Roberto Ruspoli and Zanobi Ruspoli ‚Äì lived in 1391 * Lorenzo Ruspoli ‚Äì born in 1384 ‚Äì Praetor of Begonia in 1432 ‚Äî Praetor of Piccioli in 1460 ‚Äì Gonfaloniere of Florence * Giovanni Ruspoli ‚Äì born on April 25, 1420 ‚Äì Buried in Ognissanti ‚Äî marries 1) Maddalena Buti 2) Bartolomea Paffi * Lorenzo Ruspoli ‚Äì born in 1460 ‚Äì took part in many the travels of Amerigo Vespucci ‚Äì marries Alessandra da Magguale It is Bartolomeo, son of the above-mentioned Lorenzo, that the family moved away from the imperial Ghibellines and came closer to the Vatican State in Rome. Bartolomeo Ruspoli was born in Florence in 1496. He formed a business partnerships with the Altoviti family, who were influential wool traders and bankers. In 1529 Bartolomeo travelled to Rome where he married Maria Ardinghelli niece of Cardinal Niccol√≤ Ardinghelli, an influential member of the Farnese fraction and an intimate associate of Alessandro Farnese, future Pope Paul III. The Ruspoli were thus integrated into the Roman Curia and the papal court, and Bartolomeo's children, both sons and daughters, were all married into families of the Roman nobility: Muti, Cavalieri and Floridi.Trevor Dean, K. J. P. Lowe, Marriage in Italy, 1300-1650, Cambridge University Press 1998, page 207 In 1531 Bartolomeo Ruspoli was named Petitioner of the apostolic letters by Pope Clement VII. In 1535 he was made Prior of Florence. Gradually, and certainly by the 17th century, the Ruspoli had lost their identity as Florentine merchants and bankers, referring to themselves exclusively as Roman nobles. = The Marescotti origins= Ancient painting of Marius Scotus According to the Marescotti-Ruspoli archive and as often seen on various family trees and reported on the official \\"Libro d'oro della Nobilt√† Italiana\\" published by the Collegio Araldico, the origins of the Marescotti can be traced back to Marius Scotus born in Galloway in south west Scotland in the 8th century.Almanach de Gotha: annuaire g√©n√©alogique, diplomatique et statistique, Justus Perthes, 1926Leo S. Olschki, Archivio Storico Italiano, Deputazione toscana, 1875 In the year 773 king Charlemagne started a military campaign against the Lombards in Italy, because they were not respecting an agreement made with Pepin the Short to give part of their land to the state of the Church. He asked for help from king of D√°l Riata (Western Scotland) Eochaid IV.The king in question was more probably √Åed Find. It seems there might have been some confusion during the middle ages on the rulers of Dalriata. The latter asked his cousin Count William of Douglas to recruit and bring to France a brigade of 4,000 men, which he did. But soon thereafter he had to return to Scotland to govern the family clan, leaving his command to his younger brother Marius Douglas, who at the time was described as courageous, tall, strong and with a reddish beard.Galeazzo Ruspoli, I Ruspoli, Gremese Editore, 2001. page 10 The army of the Franks crossed the Alps and took base in the Benedictine Abbey of Novalesa, in the high valley of Dora Riparia. Mario Scoto, as he was known in Italy, discovered a small path through forests between the mountains which was absolutely unusable by the army, but perfect for the Scottish highlanders. After walking quietly for three days along the path, Mario Scoto and his men attacked the Lombards by surprise from the back, while king Charlemagne attacked with the cavalry from the front. It was a major victory for the Franks which marked the decline of the Lombards in Italy. In the spring of the following year, Pope Adrian I and the king decided to meet. With a small escort, amongst whom Mario Scoto was present, Charlemagne travelled the ancient via Cassia to Saint Peter's Basilica where he was received and blessed by the pope. Mario Scoto was Catholic as were the majority of Scottsmen at the time and at the service of his king became himself a defender of the Faith. He became an appreciated military advisor and distinguished himself in the Spanish campaign and in the battle against the Saxons at the confluence of the Weser with the Aller in which of the 5,000 Saxons, only the 500 who chose to be baptised were spared their lives. Towards the end of the century Mario Scoto retired from the army, married an Italian noblewoman called Marozia and, for his devotion to the pope, settled in Rome where he was granted the honor to escort the pope. He was therefore present when in April 799 Pope Leo III was assaulted and kidnapped near the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina. Mario Scoto was able to find the pope in a monastery on the Aventine Hill and rescued him and returned him to his throne at the Holy See. The scene was later painted in Bologna by Giuseppe Antonio Caccioli. Mariscotti Coat of Arms On Christmas Day 800 Mario Scoto was invested Count of Bagnacavallo in Romagna and was granted the privilege to ornate his family crest, which already had the rampant leopard of Scotland, with the three fleur-de-lis, characteristic symbol of the French kings. The family still conserves a very ancient portrait of a soldier with the following encryption in Latin: \\"Marius de Calveis, Scotus, Carl Mag M Dux Familiam Marescotti Fundavit ANN D. DCCC\\" (Marius of Galloway, Scottish, military commander under Charlemagne, founder of the Marescotti family. AD 800) In the 9th century the Marescotti people (name derived from Mario Scoto) carried the title of counts of Bagnacavallo, a large fiefdom between the Lamone and Savio rivers. Charlemagne had received vast lands in the Bologna area and had later distributed them, as was the custom in those days, to the veterans of his army.

Alberto Marescotti son of Ugolino was Consul of Bologna, Captain general of the infantry of Bologna, then took Faenza in 1281 and regained Imola in 1290. =From Renaissance to Enlightment= The navy commander Fabrizio Ruspoli son of Bartolomeo Ruspoli and Maria Ardinghelli distinguished himself in the Battle of Lepanto. The Ottomans lost all but 30 of its ships and as many as 30,000 men, a decisive victory for Christianity and a strategic military one, that marked the start of the decline of the Ottoman's power in the Mediterranean. The Christians attributed the victory to the protection of the Virgin Mary, whom they had invoked by reciting the Rosary, and Pope Pius V instituted a feast in its honor as Our Lady of Victory. Orazio Ruspoli, brother of Fabrizio, became a successful banker and was then named magistrate of the colleges in 1557. Together with his third brother Alessandro he started the Banco Ruspoli in Siena and the family became very wealthy. Orazio married Felice Cavalieri and had two children. Lorenzo Ruspoli, their cousin, was in the wool trade and also became a successful banker in Florence and then Consul.Louis Alexander Waldman, Baccio Bandinelli, At The Medici Court Diane 2004 he then married lady Maria di Bernardo Franceschi and had two children; Antonio and Francesco (born on August 20, 1579). The latter became a published satirical poet.Stefano Rosselli, Poesie di Francesco Ruspoli, Andrea Cavalcanti, 1882Giovanni Battista Ricciardi, Rime burlesche, edite ed inedite, Toci Ettore, 1881 Vittoria Ruspoli, daughter of Orazio and Felice Cavalieri, married in 1617 Sforza Vicino Marescotti, Count of Vignanello, lord of Parrano, Roman noble and Patrizio of Bologna, Magistrate of Conservatori of Bologna in 1632 and Conservatore di Roma in 1654. Vittoria's brother, Bartolomeo Ruspoli after acquiring the fiefdom of the Marquis of Cerveteri and in Rome the Palace on the Ara Coeli, having no children of his own donated everything to the heirs of her sister. 280x280px Vittoria's husband, Sforza Vicino, descended from the Farnese family from both his mother's and his father's side (see the image on the right). From his father's side he inherited the fiefdom of Vignanello (from the wedding between Sfortia Marescotti and Ortesia Farnese Countess of Vignanello). His grandmother was Giulia Farnese. The entire branch of the Farnese (Dukes of Latera) became extinct and the descendants of the Marescottis (later called Ruspolis by will of Vittoria Ruspoli) kept the fiefdom and the Castello Ruspoli in Vignanello up to our days. Meanwhile, Clarice born March 6, 1585, sister of Sforza Vicino Marescotti, became a nun in the convent of San Bernardino in Viterbo with the name of Sister Giacinta. She was canonized Saint by Pope Pius VII in 1807. Her feast is celebrated on January 30. Galeazzo Marescotti, son of Sforza Vicino and Vittoria was elected cardinal by Pope Clement X.  The Marescotti-Ruspoli  Francesco Maria Marescotti Ruspoli, first prince of CerveteriThe Ruspoli family in 1807.Francesco Maria Marescotti Ruspoli, first-born son of Alessandro (of Sforza Vicino Marescotti, 4th Conte di Vignanello and Vittoria dei Principi Ruspoli), was born March 2, 1672. In 1695 he married lady Isabella Cesi, daughter of Giuseppe Angelo, fifth Duke of Acquasparta and Giacinta Conti of the Dukes of Poli and Guadagnolo (sister of Pope Innocent XIII). Francesco Maria appreciated and helped the development of Academy of Arcadia of which he was a member under the pseudonym Olinto. He was the first patron to welcome them in one of his villas on Via Merulana. The first volume of the Rime degli Arcadi was dedicated to Francesco Maria. In 1725 the Arcadia took permanent residence in the Gianicolo villa of Bosco Parrasio. In 1707 George Frideric Handel arrived in Rome where for two years he was a guest of Francesco Maria Ruspoli, who named him Kapellmeister. During this period he composed Salve Regina (HWV 241) which he performed in the Ruspoli Castle in Vignanello and Diana Cacciatrice (HWV 79) which he performed in Palazzo Ruspoli in Cerveteri. In Rome at the Ruspolis and the Ottobonis he performed the oratorios La Resurrezione (HWV 47) and the Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno (HWV 46a) both dedicated to Francesco Maria Marescotti Ruspoli. Between 1709 and 1716 he was succeeded as Kapellmeister by Antonio Caldara. Cardinal Galeazzo Marescotti watched over his beloved nephew and was pleased with the brilliant life, but more so with the great culture, munificence, and devotion to God of Francesco Maria. The cardinal had a precise plan: to persuade the pope to elevate the title of the fiefdom of Cerveteri from marquis to prince.Galeazzo Ruspoli, I Ruspoli, Gremese Editore, 2001 Other Roman noble families such as the Aldobrandini, Boncompagni, Borghese and Erba-Odescalchi were made princes by their respective popes. The Ruspolis did not have a pope and it was necessary to make a munificent gesture and to acquire particular merits with the Holy See. In 1707 the cardinal persuaded his nephew to arm a brig to donate to the Holy See. The modern hull with wide sails was delivered in Civitavecchia. Handel had composed for the occasion a choral of white voices on a text greeting the pope king. But that was not enough to elevate Cerveteri to a principality. In 1708 Francesco Maria created the Ruspoli Regiment at his own expense. Formed by nearly 1,000 men, the regiment enjoyed some minor victories, until 1709 when in Ferrara thanks to a superior armament they were able to push the Austrians back to the north of the Po River. A great victory for which on February 3, 1709, full of gratitude, Pope Clement XI elevated Cerveteri to a Principality. In 1710 Prince Francesco Maria Marescotti Ruspoli acquired the fiefdom of Riano where he enriched the town with privileges and public works. In 1713 he acquired the fiefdom of San Felice Circeo which then passed in 1718 to his daughter's husband, Filippo Orsini. Still in 1713 Francesco Maria bought the Palazzo Ruspoli in Rome from the Caetani who had charged Martino Longhi the Younger to build the sumptuous loggia on the courtyard and the famous staircase, one of the four wonders of Rome. In 1721 Pope Benedict XIII conferred to Francesco Maria the title of Principe Romano, for himself and his descendants, ad infinitum so the family could conserve the prestige of its ancestors.Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica da s. Pietro sino ai nostri giorni, Tipografia Emiliana, 1846 Pope Benedict XIII then came to Vignanello in 1725 to solemnly consecrate the new parish church built by the will of Prince Francesco Maria. In 1792 Francesco Ruspoli, 3rd Prince of Cerveteri was created Prince of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor Francis II. Today Prince Francesco Ruspoli, 10th Prince of Cerveteri is the head of the House of Ruspoli and resident in Palazzo Ruspoli in Rome.

It spent its working life on the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. The locomotive was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the Inyo, because of their association with the Virginia and Truckee Railroad and transportation development in Nevada. The Dayton, a 4-4-0 \\"American\\", was built in 1873 by the Central Pacific Railroad, in Sacramento, California, and was based on the design of the CP's 173 engine. The locomotive weighs , has driving wheels, and carried of water and 3 cords of wood. A large snow plow was fixed to the front of the locomotive in 1879, and it performed snow clearing duties on the Virginia & Truckee lines during the winters for most of its operational life, in addition to its normal passenger hauling duties. In 1906 the locomotive had the honor of opening the branch line between Carson City and Minden, Nevada, but after that it was used less frequently. In 1908 it was converted to burn oil rather than wood. In 1937, the locomotive, minus the plow, was sold for $1,000 together with No. 22 Inyo to Paramount Pictures who then had the locomotive overhauled at the Southern Pacific Railroad shops at Sparks, Nevada. Paramount had the locomotive repainted and renumbered for use in motion pictures.  The Dayton film history  The Dayton appeared in several movies, beginning with Union Pacific. It traveled to New York City in 1939 to promote this film. Other movies featuring the Dayton include Young Tom Edison, The Harvey Girls and Duel in the Sun. Post-Retirement In 1937 the locomotive was sold to Paramount Pictures. In 1969 the locomotive participated in ceremonies for the centennial of the Golden Spike. Dayton was modified to represent Union Pacific's No. 119. It remained at the Golden Spike National Historic Site throughout most of the 1970s, along with the V&T;'s Inyo, which was modified to represent the Central Pacific's Jupiter. In 1974, both locomotives were sold to the State of Nevada, but remained in Utah while brand-new replicas of the Golden Spike locomotives were under construction. Both Inyo and Dayton finally arrived at the Nevada State Railroad Museum in Carson City in late 1978. Once at the museum, the Inyo and Dayton were evaluated for possible restoration to operating condition. The boiler of the latter was found to be in poor condition and would require replacing for the engine to operate. Since the Daytons boiler was original, it was decided to instead give the engine a cosmetic restoration. Dayton made its debut at the museum on Memorial Day weekend, 1982. In 2005, the Dayton was moved to the Comstock History Center in Virginia City, Nevada, where it was displayed until April 2018. It was then returned to the Nevada State Railroad Museum in exchange for Virginia and Truckee 4-6-0 No. 27, which took the Dayton's place on exhibit at the Comstock History Center.

It is marketed by Basilea Pharmaceutica in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Austria under the trade name Zevtera, in France and Italy under the trade name Mabelio. Like other cephalosporins, ceftobiprole exerts its antibacterial activity by binding to important penicillin-binding proteins and inhibiting their transpeptidase activity which is essential for the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. Ceftobiprole has high affinity for penicillin-binding protein 2a of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and retains its activity against strains that express divergent mecA gene homologues (mecC or mecALGA251). Ceftobiprole also binds to penicillin-binding protein 2b in Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-intermediate), to penicillin-binding protein 2x in Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-resistant), and to penicillin-binding protein 5 in Enterococcus faecalis.  Microbiology  Ceftobiprole has shown in vitro antimicrobial activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Among the Gram-positive pathogens, ceftobiprole has demonstrated good in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, as well as against strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to linezolid, daptomycin or vancomycin. Ceftobiprole has also displayed potent activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-sensitive, penicillin-resistant and ceftriaxone-resistant strains) and Enterococcus faecalis, but not against Enterococcus faecium. For Gram- negative pathogens, ceftobiprole has shown good in vitro activity against Haemophilus influenzae (including both ampicillin-susceptible and ampicillin- non-susceptible isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis that do not produce extended-spectrum Œ≤-lactamases (ESBL). Like all other cephalosporins, ceftobiprole was inactive against strains that produce extended-spectrum Œ≤-lactamases. The efficacy of ceftobiprole has been demonstrated in two large randomized, double-blind, phase 3 clinical trials in patients with hospital- acquired and community-acquired pneumonia. Ceftobiprole was non-inferior to ceftazidime plus linezolid in the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (excluding ventilator-acquired pneumonia) and non-inferior to ceftriaxone with or without linezolid in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Pharmacology 120px Ceftobiprole is the active moiety of the prodrug ceftobiprole medocaril and is available for intravenous treatment only. The recommended dose is 500 mg as 2-hour infusion every 8 hours. It is mainly excreted renally. Dose adjustment is required for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and for patients with end-stage renal disease, but no dose adjustment is needed by gender, ethnicity or age, in severely obese patients or in patients with hepatic impairment.

E. Olds trombone, c. 1927, with the trademark \\"Golden Bear\\" and date of the 1912 patent. F. E. Olds was a manufacturer of musical instruments founded by Frank Ellsworth (F.E.) Olds in Los Angeles, California in the early 1900s. The company made brass instruments, especially trombones, cornets, and trumpets. By the late 1960s or early 1970s, although still producing some professional level instruments, the company had become better known for mass-produced student instruments. Construction quality declined as production quotas were emphasized. That plus competition from other companies and cutbacks in school music budgets led to the firm going out of business in 1979. The Olds and Reynolds names (Olds merged with F.A. Reynolds in 1964) have since been bought and revived in 1983 by a new company under the name F.E. Olds and Sons,https://www.njportal.com/dor/businessrecords/EntityDocs/BusinessCopies.aspx based in Mountainside, New Jersey. History Frank Ellsworth (F.E.) Olds was born in Medina, New York in 1861. He was named for the Civil War hero Frank Ellsworth of the Ellsworth Zouaves. While a child his family moved to Toledo, Ohio. After finishing high school, F.E. went to Elkhart, Indiana to work for C.G. Conn and learned the brass instrument making business. In 1885, he moved to Los Angeles, California. An amateur trombone player and entrepreneur, he first set up a shop to build bicycles, which was the only one in Los Angeles at the time. By 1886, he had established the first electroplating shop in Southern California, doing silver plating with H. T. Hazard, establishing the Los Angeles Tool Works by 1887. 1886 also marked the arrival in Los Angeles of F.E.'s future bride, Helen Daisy Birdsall. In 1901, he was a machinist with the Locomobile Company of the Pacific, branching out from bicycles to automobiles. All along experimenting with trombone design, he was repairing band instruments full-time by 1910. This early work was done in a small workshop behind his house, which was just south of downtown Los Angeles. It was probably about this time that he first offered his new trombones for sale. Implementing new ideas patented in 1912 (some of these are incorporated in trombones today), Olds started producing quality trombones on a small scale. From the earliest years, he was offering a variety of bore sizes (.485\\" and dual bores from .494\\"/.509\\" to .509\\"/.535\\") and bell diameters from 6\\" to 9 ¬Ω\\". Model designations were Solo, Small Medium, Medium, Large Medium, Large and Symphony, which did not indicate a particular bore and bell combination, but a relative size. Most Olds trombones were made to order at this time. These new trombones apparently met with success quickly, and with the help of Earl Strickler and Earl Williams, Olds expanded production to about 200 a year and moved into a large facility by the early 1920s. Reginald Birdsall (R.B.) Olds (b. September 11, 1899) came to work with his father in 1920, having served in the U.S. Navy during World War I. With R.B.'s enthusiasm, Olds published their first catalogue in 1925 and introduced new models shortly after. It was about 1924 that Olds started making mouthpieces with ivory rim and cup and the trademark \\"Golden Bear\\" playing the trombone was first engraved on the bells. R.B. was most likely responsible for using the slogan: \\"It's a Bear\\", and otherwise modernizing the image of the company and its products. Also, during these years, they were working on trumpet design, finally tooling up for its production by 1928. On October 9, 1928, F.E. was traveling with his wife and other prominent Californians on the S.S. City of Los Angeles (later commissioned, ) to South America. He died suddenly and unexpectedly, suffering a heart attack, and was buried at sea. His new trumpets were not offered for sale until after his death. R.B. introduced cornets soon afterward. The Super Olds line of trombones, trumpets and cornets was introduced in about 1932 and soon became legendary. Other models introduced in the 1930s include the Special, Military, Symphony and French models. All but the Super models could be ordered with a distinctive hammered finish on the bell. This was the standard finish for the Military line. The Super bass trombone could be had with two valves, both actuated by levers. This is likely the first production bass trombone with two valve levers. There were also some french horns made in the late 1930s, although they didn't appear in the catalogues at that time. The Recording model trumpet and cornet were probably designed shortly before the war halted production. During World War II, the government had Olds produce saxophones along with the more standard strategic production. Today these are very rare as they were not generally available to the public and a large number of them went down with a supply ship in the Mediterranean. By 1941 Olds held at least six patents for trumpet and trombone design. Shortly after World War II ended and brass instrument manufacturing restrictions were lifted, Chicago Musical Instruments purchased F.E. Olds & Son. One of CMI's initial operating decisions was to begin producing a full line of background and low brass instruments in addition to the trumpet, cornet and trombone models that Olds was already making and had built its reputation on. However, the Olds plant in Los Angeles was not set up for manufacturing the additional brass lines and CMI had difficulty finding a partner who would provide these instruments to Olds without also producing the more profitable small brass and trombones. Instead, CMI's president, Maurice Berlin, coaxed Foster Reynolds, a former apprentice at J.W. York,30 year veteran of the H.N. White company, and founder of F.A. Reynolds Co., out of retirement and sent him to Los Angeles with a directive to tool up the factory and begin manufacturing the full line of brasses. Reynolds was regarded as one of the top brass instrument designers in the country, and was responsible for the introduction of many of the finest Olds trumpets and cornets. In the late 1940s, in a meeting between Reynolds, Reg Olds and Berlin, it was decided to pursue the student musician market for which great projections had been made. Among his first design actions were the renowned Ambassador model trumpet, cornet and trombone (1948). In fact, the trumpet was designed in tandem with the Mendez professional model. Because Olds management was concerned about the possible effects of a low-priced model on the company's reputation, Reynolds insisted the horn be built to the same quality and tolerances of the rest of the line, only with less-expensive bracing and other features. According to R. Dale Olsen, who was R&D; director at Olds in the 1960s, the company was a \\"one tolerance shop,\\" meaning that all brass instruments were crafted to the same close tolerances, regardless of price or market niche. Built on the same bell mandrels as the premium Recording models and featuring extremely reliable valve sections, the Ambassador line was intended to reflect Reynolds' professional commitment to providing high-quality, dependable horns at an affordable price. The \\"Brilliant Bell\\" of the 1948/49 Studio line (trumpet, cornet, trombone) points to either collaboration or competition with Reynold's former company in Cleveland, who had launched an identical nickel-silver bell flare on the Emperor (\\"Silver Flare\\") and Roth (\\"Tone Tempered\\") lines in 1947. Another accomplishment to Reynolds' credit was his signing of the trumpeter Rafael M√©ndez in the late 1940s to be an Olds clinician and endorsor. He worked closely with Mr. Mendez to create the artist's signature model trumpet and long cornet. Reynolds began by measuring the F. Besson Meha trumpet that Mendez was so fond of and then evolving the design (actually, the measuring was reportedly done by his brother, Harper. The lead pipe, for example, was very different from anything Olds had produced). These were professional trumpets accepted as equal to or better than what was currently on the market. The Mendez trumpet was used and endorsed by the likes of David Jandorf and Clyde McCoy. The large bore (.468\\") Opera trumpet and cornet models followed several years later. Rafael M√©ndez's name and the use of the Recording and Super models by other professionals is credited with enhancing the image and sales of Olds instruments. In 1952, Reynolds, as the plant supervisor, brought Don Agard to Olds from F.A. Reynolds Co. One of Agard's first projects was managing the move in 1954 from Olds' long-time factory in Los Angeles to larger facilities in Fullerton, California. In 1953, the company was joined by a young Zigmant Kanstul. Starting out at Olds as a French horn assembler, Kanstul apprenticed in the art of brass instrument building from Reynolds. Reynolds died of a heart attack on July 18, 1960, while at work at the Fullerton plant. After his death, Agard took over plant operations while Kanstul became factory superintendent. Reynold's brother, Harper, who was shop superintendent and who helped launch the Ambassador instruments, retired. R. Dale Olsen was brought in as director of research with a directive to create a line of upper-register trumpets. He succeeded in designing the 'C', 'D' and 'E Flat' trumpets and subsequently the \\"Custom-Crafted\\" series of B flat trumpets that featured one-piece hand-hammered bells. By the 1960s, Olds was producing trumpets, cornets, slide and valve trombones, alto horns, mellophones, french horns, euphoniums, tubas and sousaphones. They also supplied imported woodwind instruments in the Ambassador line. Olds was the second U.S. maker to have produced over one million brass instruments. Increases in volume were accompanied by a lessening in quality, however. Kanstul remained at Olds until the early 1970s when he left to become manager of the nearby Benge plant and eventually his own company, Kanstul Musical Instruments. Agard ran operations at Olds until the company finally closed its doors in 1979. Olds merged with competitor and Foster's former company, F.A. Reynolds Co., in 1964. By the mid-1970s, with parent company Norlin in control, there was a perceived decrease in the quality of construction that made Olds famous. The name became closely associated with the student models, and less with the professional models. A buyer for the firm was sought beginning in 1978, but Norlin could not sell the Olds factory for its asking price. The decision was made to close the Fullerton plant and the machinery, tools and parts inventory were auctioned. References/External links *Robb Stewart's History of F. E.

Raspberry Island () is an island of the Kodiak Archipelago located in the Gulf of Alaska in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is located two miles northwest of Whale Island, and just across the mile-wide Raspberry Strait from the southwestern end of Afognak. The island is separated from Kodiak Island by the Kupreanof Strait, with the Shelikof Strait to the northwest. Raspberry Island is 18 miles (29 km) long with a width that varies from 3 miles (4.8 km) to 8 miles (12.9 km). The highest point on the island is 3,300 ft (1000 m). The island is considered part of the Aleneva census-designated place in the Kodiak Island Borough. The only permanent residents on Raspberry Island are located at Port Wakefield and Raspberry Island Remote Lodge which operate full service wilderness lodges. Power is provided via hydro power harnessed in nearby creeks. The nearest town is Kodiak, Alaska, an hour-and-a-half boat ride or a thirty-minute float plane ride away. Environment and wildlife A fin whale surfacing in Raspberry Strait. Mountain roses and sitka spruce overlooking Raspberry Strait. Sitka spruce is one of the dominant trees on Raspberry Island. Spruce forests are interrupted by fields of salmonberry bushes, alders and wildflowers. Higher elevations have wild blueberry and cranberry bushes with more grasses. Wildlife of note on the island includes Sitka deer, red foxes and Kodiak bears, as well as tufted puffins and bald eagles. Afognak and Raspberry islands are the only locations in Alaska with elk populations. The island's Roosevelt Elk developed from eight calves translocated from Washington state's Olympic Peninsula in 1928. The elk have adapted well to the island, with some mature bulls weighing nearly . The muskrat is another species that was successfully introduced to the island. Whales commonly meander down Raspberry Strait but must turn around because it becomes too shallow for them to pass all the way through. Kayakers take advantage of this phenomenon to wait for them to pass by again on their way back out to deeper water. Bald eagles are abundant. History A fox searches for a meal along a rocky shore on Raspberry Island at low tide. Originally inhabited by Aleut natives for over 7000 years, Russian fur traders took control of the islands in the 18th century and nearly wiped out the now abundant sea otters that can often be seen floating together in the strait. Several fishing canneries existed on the island including Port Wakefield and Northwest Cannery in the early 20th century. These went out of business several decades later and a fox fur farm existed on the Northwest Cannery site for a while. Deposits of placer gold were noted at Raspberry Beach as early as 1915. However, the last recorded mining activity on the beach was in 1935. The half-mile long beach is located on the northwest coast of the island at Drivers Bay. Much of the island is owned by the First Native Corporation and is uninhabited except for the two wilderness lodges that exist on land previously owned by the canneries. Economy Sea lions gather just outside Raspberry Strait across from Raspberry Island near Afognak. After the decline of the canneries, their land was eventually purchased and used by the two wilderness lodges as tourist destinations. They are unique because the land surrounding them and on the opposing Afognak Island is owned by the First Native corporation and almost completely uninhabited. Fishing vessels based in the city of Kodiak and Port Lions regularly fish the waters around Raspberry Island for the abundant salmon and halibut. Tourists frequent the two wilderness lodges that provide bear viewing, kayaking, extreme wilderness adventures and backpacking, ocean and fly fishing as well as hunting excursions. National Geographic filmed a true television story about two hunters that had separate bear encounters on Kodiak, one hunter was killed by a bear on nearby Uganik Island, the other stabbed the bear with a knife and then killed it with a gun on Raspberry Island and was able to drag himself out to be rescued by his son and Coast Guard airlift. Silver Salmon is one of the salmon spawning streams on the island available to fishermen and observers. Transportation Katmai coast. There are no roads on Raspberry island except between the lodgings at one of the two wilderness lodges. Hiking trails do exist and are used by wildlife as well as the occasional human. Although it has been known to happen that people have arrived at Raspberry via kayak while on an extreme wilderness adventure, most transportation to and from the island is by floatplane or boat. All inhabitants, tourists, and supplies arrive at the island by first going through the city of Kodiak, Alaska, the nearest town, which is an hour- and-a-half boat ride or a thirty-minute float plane ride away.

Tematagi's nearest neighbour is Mururoa, which is located to the ESE. Tematagi is a medium-sized atoll. It measures approximately in length and has a maximum width of with a land area of almost . As its reef completely encloses the deep lagoon, which is , there is no navigable pass to enter the lagoon. There are many relatively large islands on Tematagi's reef, as well as a few small motu. The main village is Tuihana. There were 58 inhabitants on Tematagi in the last census. History The first recorded European to visit this atoll was Captain William Bligh on the ship Providence on April 5, 1792. At the time of Bligh's visit, it was uninhabited. Tematagi Atoll appears in some maps as \\"Bligh's Lagoon Island\\". When Frederick Beechey visited Tematagi in 1826 he found inhabitants there. In 1857, the captain of the Julia, coasting along Tematagi Atoll saw armed natives follow the course of his schooner... \\"clad in many-coloured stuffs\\".  Population  In 1966, Catholic missionary Father Victor Valleys mentioned in a letter to his bishop that he had planted 135,000 coconut trees on the islands. Teams of workers from neighboring atolls spent three or four months a year at Tematagi harvesting copra. Legally, the atoll did not belong in the public domain of Polynesia: a document states that \\"the atoll of Tematagi was granted a final license to SCI Tematagi Vanavana in 1974.\\" This SCI was led by Valleys and ceased operation with his death in 1986. A pontoon landing was built at the village of Teakoro, along with a church and administrative buildings. The legal status of the population is not clear since the atoll remains the property of SCI, under the guise of a Catholic Mission. Transactions were even made in 1998 between the Vice- President of French Polynesia and Bruno Wan, a pearl prospector. In 2001, the village had 36 residents. The atoll has no airstrip, but, since 2015 there has been a telephone and fax service via satellite. Antipode of Mecca Tematagi is the closest land area to the antipode of Mecca. This means that the correct direction of Muslim prayer (qibla) varies widely between Tematagi and its neighboring islands. The exact antipode of Tematagi, however, is the Jeddah Eastern Forest, a recreation area east of the Saudi-Arabian harbour city of Jeddah. This map shows the antipodes of each point on the Earth's surface; the points where the blue and yellow overlap are land antipodes (most land has its antipodes in the ocean). Both Mecca and Tematagi are to the upper left of the center of the map. Administration Administratively Tematagi belongs to the commune of Tureia, which includes the atolls of Tureia, Fangataufa, Moruroa, Tematagi and Vanavana.

When she was three some of her watercolours were selected for an exhibition held by the Royal Society of Drawing. At the age of seven one of her paintings, Happy Days by the Sea, was exhibited at the New Irish Salon in Dublin, having been chosen on merit by judges who knew nothing of her age. Her first one-woman 'retrospective' was held when she was nine at the Claridge Gallery in London. She was hailed as a child genius by newspapers throughout Britain and as far away as Boston, and, in a matter of days, each one of the hundred paintings on show had sold. Yet despite her fame she was a very private person and after studying at the Royal Academy Schools for just a few months she gave up formal study and became a Land Girl. In her adult life Somerville continued to paint and, during the early 1960s, she moved to Middleton, near Westleton in Suffolk. From here she made frequent excursions to the coast nearby, particularly to her beloved Aldeburgh. An archetypal British Impressionist who made Suffolk her home, protecting and developing the fresh, unpretentious vision she had made her own, and was able to continue to paint the things she loved: sunlight, landscapes, flowers and her family. While in many ways she can be seen as continuing the tradition from Gainsborough, through Constable and Thomas Churchyard, to Wilson Steer, she was also deeply indebted to the French Impressionists, especially Bonnard. From 1964 until her early death she lived and worked in Suffolk painting vigorous oils, watercolours and pastels, her Aldeburgh paintings showing a rare sensuality and sensitivity. After her early fame, her national reputation declined until she was rediscovered by the art historian Stephen Reiss during the period he was managing the Aldeburgh Festival. Somerville is now recognised as one of the most interesting of the later British impressionists. She died on 29 June 1975, after suffering from cancer. Norfolk Museums Service holds a number of her works.
