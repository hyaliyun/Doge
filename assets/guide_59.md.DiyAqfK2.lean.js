Winter91, Issue 52: 50-60 and her strident political opinions, have stirred controversy within Germany, but Dahn, who considered herself a dissident within East Germany before 1989, advocates for a critical journalism that continues the democratic tradition of challenging the government and policies of reunified Germany. Biography Dahn is the daughter of the journalist Karl-Heinz Gerstner and fashion journalist Sibylle Gerstner, founder of the East German fashion magazine \\"Sibyl\\", and the older sister of Sonja Gerstner, who famously documented her own mental illness and the professional treatment she received. Dahn was born just two days after the founding of the East German state. Dahn was brought up in Kleinmachnow, Brandenburg in what was then East Germany. Daniela Dahn studied journalism in Leipzig and then worked as a television journalist, editing for GDR Television, before turning to freelance writing in 1981. In 1989 Dahn became one of the founders of the GDR opposition group Democratic Awakening. She later withdrew from it. (German) The Party of Democratic Socialism controversially introduced Dahn as one of their two candidates for the office of Constitutional Court judge in Brandenburg, in 1998. Her nomination was challenged by the Social Democratic Party of Germany and her candidacy was retracted at the last moment, after heated debate among the parties of the Brandenburg state parliament. Dahn serves on the Executive Board of the writers' association PEN and lectures internationally. Dahn is also on the Advisory Board of the Humanist Union, and has held the post of Writer in Residence at Sunderland University in the UK. In addition, Dahn is co-editor of the weekly newspaper der Fritag. Her husband Jochen Laabs was from 1999 to 2001 Vice-President of PEN Center in Germany. Along with Christa Wolf, with whom she has collaborated in the past, Dahn was seen as a possible choice by Die Linke as their candidate for President of Germany in the 2009 presidential election.

Veteran Campaigners ‚Äì A History of the Punjab Regiment 1759-1981. Lahore: Wajidalis. Early history The regiment was formed during the upheaval of the Indian Mutiny in 1857 as the 7th Regiment of Punjab Infantry on the orders of John Lawrence, the British Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, and saw service in North India. In 1864, it participated in the Bhutan war, and during the Second Afghan War of 1878-80, the regiment fought with distinction in the Battle of Ahmed Khel. In 1891, it took part in the Black Hill Expedition and the 2nd Miranzai Expedition on the North West Frontier of India. In 1903, the 19th Punjab Infantry took part in the British expedition to Tibet.Pigot, G. (1946). History of the 1st Battalion, 14th Punjab Regiment, Sherdil-ki-Paltan (late XIX Punjabis). New Delhi: Roxy Printing Press. 19th Punjabis Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to the 19th Punjabis. On the outbreak of the First World War, it initially remained in India guarding the North West Frontier as part of the 4th (Quetta) Division. In February 1916, it moved to Persia, where it had the unique distinction of being actively engaged against the Bolsheviks in 1918 during the hard-fought actions at Merv, Kaka and Dushak in the Russian Turkestan. At Dushak, all of the British officers, and the Indian Subedar Major of the regiment, were either killed or wounded, and the battalion was led by a Subedar. In 1917, the 19th Punjabis raised a second battalion, which was disbanded after the war. Subsequent History In 1921-22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 14th Punjab Regiment, formed by grouping the 19th Punjabis with the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 24th Punjabis, and the 40th Pathans. The battalion's new designation was 1st Battalion 14th Punjab Regiment. The battalion was often referred to by the British as the Battalion of Sherdil or Sherdil ki Paltan because of a Muslim Sepoy Sherdil known to hold some special spiritual powers and was found out by a British officer for offering prayers at one place and being on sentry duty at other at exactly the same time. During the Second World War, the battalion fought in the Malayan Campaign and was taken prisoner by the Japanese on Singapore Island following the British surrender on 15 February 1942. 90% of the officers and men of the battalion joined the Japanese Supported Indian National Army and fought against the British in the subsequent Battles. The battalion was re-raised in 1946.Haig, Brodie. Fourteenth Punjab Regiment 1939-1945. London: Lund Humphries. In 1947, the 14th Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was merged with the 1st, 15th and 16th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment, and 1/14th Punjab was re designated as 5 Punjab Sherdils. During the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, the battalion fought in Kashmir, while in 1971, it was deployed in a defensive role at Mandi Sadiq Ganj in the Punjab.350px Genealogy *1857 7th Regiment of Punjab Infantry *1861 23rd Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry *1861 19th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry *1864 19th (Punjab) Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry *1885 19th (Punjab) Regiment of Bengal Infantry *1901 19th Punjab Infantry *1903 19th Punjabis *1916 1st Battalion 19th Punjabis *1919 19th Punjabis *1922 1st Battalion 14th Punjab Regiment *1956 5th Battalion The Punjab Regiment Notable Former Personnel *Maj.

Throughout a career spanning four decades, the band has performed in a wide range of styles including blues, reggae, country, folk, ska, funk, zydeco and rock 'n roll -- distilled into a genre described as Dreadneck, a term not easily defined. They have formerly been known by a variety of other stage names, including The Manatees, The Mighty Manatees Medicine Show, and Los Manatees. History Between 1985 and 1990 the group was named simply The Manatees, and its first show was on October 31 (Halloween), 1985. At the time, the band was a duo, consisting of Will Hodgson (formerly of One Life & Big-Eyed Beans From Venus) and Ray Adkins, which relied on drum machines and sequencers. During this time, they released two live cassettes and two videos, including the cult classic Manatees In Manhattan. In 1990 bass player Roy Truax and drummer Myles Rothwell were added to the line-up. The following year, the studio album High Water was released. In 1992 Truax left the band and was replaced by Rothwell's cousin Randy Wagner. In 1993 Adkins left the band and Hodgson effectively took over. From then on, the group, renamed The Mighty Manatees, became a de facto musical co- operative which employed a steady stream of various musicians coming and going. In January 2000, Karl Frick joined the band playing Hammond Organ and Wurlitzer electric piano. On September 11, 2002 the band played alongside G.L. Brackett, an English professor and musician, in a tribute to those who died in the September 11 attacks. In January 2007 Jim Cavanaugh, previously of Wanderlust, became the drummer for The Mighty Manatees. In September 2011 Andrew Geltzer became the keyboard player and Karl Frick switched from Hammond/Wurlitzer to bass, replacing Randy Wagner. In 2012 Jim Cavanaugh and Will Hodgson played in Belfast and Dublin, backing up Shana Morrison opening for father Van Morrison. In 2014 Tim Hooper replaced Andrew Geltzer on keyboards. In 2015 Jim Hines (formerly Brian Wilson's drummer) replaced Jim Cavanaugh.

He painted small and unpretentious still lifes in a style more typical of the first half of the century, and was \\"one of the last practitioners of this intimate category\\".Slive, p. 319 Biography Very little is known of his life, but he is assumed to have been born and died in Middelburg. He became a pupil of Melchior d'Hondecoeter around 1680 in Amsterdam. Hondecoeter is known for repetitions of certain birds in certain poses, and he apparently took on pupils who were set to work copying these into their compositions. They form an unmistakable signature in the work of his students, and Coorte is no exception: File:Adriaen Coorte - Pelican and ducks in a mountain landscape.7.jpg|Pelican and ducks in a mountain landscape, by Coorte File:Melchior d'Hondecoeter - Een pelikaan en ander gevogelte bij een waterbassin, bekend als 'Het drijvend veertje' - Google Art Project.jpg|The Floating Feather, with the same pelican, by Hondecoeter File:Adriaen Coorte - Asparagus, Gooseberries and Strawberries in a Window, with a View of a Bird in a Tree.jpg|Painting with a Hoopoe, by Coorte File:Vogels op een balustrade Rijksmuseum SK-A-695.jpeg|Painting with a similar Hoopoe, by Hondecoeter From 1683 he seems to have returned to Middelburg, where he set up a workshop and signed his small, carefully balanced minimalist still lifes. He often painted on paper that was glued to a wooden panel. About 80 signed works by him have been catalogued, and nearly all of them follow the same pattern; small arrangements of fruits, vegetables, or shells on a stone slab, lit from above, with the dark background typical of still lifes earlier in the century. Instead of the Chinese or silver vessels favoured by his contemporaries, his tableware is very basic pottery. \\"Objects and light are studied intensely, and are painted with a wondrous tenderness\\". Neither his birth nor death date is certain, and archival evidence only exists in Middelburg for his membership in the Guild of St. Luke there from 1695 onwards, when he was fined for selling a painting without being a member of the guild. His works appear frequently in contemporary Middelburg taxation inventories Works Still Life with Asparagus, Rijksmuseum (1697) Coorte was apparently not well known to his contemporaries outside the small city of Middelburg and, like Vermeer a century before, he was almost entirely forgotten until the 1950s, when the Dutch art historian Laurens J. Bol revived his reputation, beginning with an article in 1952, and finally publishing the first monograph and catalogue raisonn√© on Coorte in 1977 (Adriaen Coorte, Amsterdam).Slive, 338 (note 1 to Chapter 17) Bol arranged an exhibition of 35 examples of Coorte's work in 1958 at the Dordrechts Museum, which became a sensation in the Netherlands, with the poets Hans Faverey and Ed Leeflang both being inspired by the paintings. In 2003 there was an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, Washington.NGA exhibition brochure In 2008 a new travelling exhibition was set up; Ode to Coorte, that was as nearly as successful, making Coorte the most celebrated \\"rediscovered\\" Dutch Baroque painter of recent decades. Testifying to Coorte's recent popularity is the December 1st, 2009 auction of two of his new-found paintings, which each sold for more than ten times the estimated price.

Regular Freemasonry is controlled from London and Edinburgh by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) and the Grand Lodge of Scotland through local Provincial Grand Lodges. More recently Prince Hall Freemasonry has also been established on the island. History As a fraternal organisation, Freemasonry was introduced to the island in 1740 by Alexander Irvine (c. 1694-1743). The first lodge formed was the St. Michael's Lodge No 94 (or No 186). However, this lodge ceased working in the nineteenth century. Following the closure of this lodge, the Albion Lodge No 196 (UGLE) was formed in 1790, and now remains the longest established lodge in Barbados.

In 2011 the Masonic Centre in Salters, George was built which is where all of the English and Scottish Lodges in Barbados meet. One of the Lodges, the Research Lodge of Amity No 9073 EC, has a particular focus on Masonic research.

Prince Hall Freemasonry The Prince Hall Grand Lodge of the Caribbean is the newest masonic authority on Barbados. In 1960 a Barbadian educator, Mr G. Halley Marville, was introduced to Prince Hall Freemasonry in California, whilst studying in the United States of America. This led eventually to the consecration of the first Prince Hall lodge in Barbados in 1965, under the authority of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of the State of New York.See full history at the jurisdiction's own .

Early years Gamero first entered politics whilst attending the University of Seville where he was leader of the student movement.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 145 Initially a member of the monarchist Acci√≥n Espa√±ola he joined the Falange in July 1936 and was soon appointed Civil Governor of Seville. He was involved in talks with Carlists leaders in Lisbon in 1937 over merging with the Falange but the contacts failed because of his endorsement of Don Juan de Borbon as rightful heir to the throne of Spain, although subsequently Franco merged the two movements by decree.\\"Gamero del Castillo\\" archive, Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid Following the establishment of the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista later that same year Gamero was appointed to its Junta Politica, confirming his status as the rising star of the movement.

He was even acting General Secretary for a spell in 1940.Paul Preston, Franco, London: 1995, p. 258 However Gamero was no Francisco Franco loyalist and his ambitions for Serrano S√∫√±er led to problems for him. He consulted in January 1941 with Hans Lazar, the press secretary of the German Embassy and told him that a Serrano S√∫√±er government would commit to the Axis powers and thus asked for him to arrange for the Nazis to publicly back his mentor.Paul Preston, Franco, London: 1995, p. 415 Nevertheless, Gamero was a committed Catholic, who beneath a pro-German exterior was alienated by what he saw as the godless nature of the Nazi vision, and offered discreet support to British efforts to keep Spain out of the war through contacts at the British embassy in Madrid.Jimmy Burns, Papa Spy, London 2009,pp 115‚Äì116 After growing differences with Franco, Gamero became the first minister to offer his resignation in public in March 1941. However, Franco did not accept the resignation until May as part of a cabinet reshuffle.Manuel del Arco, Los 90 Ministros de Franco, Madrid 1971 In July 1943, Gamero, along with various members of the Cortes and several senior army officers, called upon Franco to prepare for the post- Second World War era by restoring the monarchy under Don Juan. Fearing the growing influence of Nazi agents Franco acted and in May 1941 Gamero was deprived of his position, along with a number of pro-Nazis such as Dionisio Ridruejo and Sancho D√°vila y Fern√°ndez de Celis.Preston, Franco, p. 435 Increasingly becoming noted for cronyism and financial corruption, Gamero was finally removed from his seat on the Council of State in 1943 after publicly calling for the restoration of the monarchy. He remained a member of the Consejo de Estado, the Council of State, having gained admission through academic merit as a jurist. Later years Deprived of his government office Gamero was part of a 1944 monarchist plot to overthrow Franco. whilst he was also closely involved in the machinations of monarchist General Alfredo Kindel√°n. By then Gamero was convinced the future of Spain lay in a constitutional monarchy. From 1946 onwards he worked on ideas for a new constitution and became part of the council of wise man advising Don Juan living in exile at Estoril in Portugal. Devoting himself to business, he was on the board or helping to run a number of major Spanish companies covering banking,(vice-president of Banco Hispano-Americano, property (Vallehermoso) and shipbuilding (Astilleros Espanoles), and latterly became a founding shareholder in El Pais, the new newspaper that played a fundamental role in the transition to democracy.

He became one of the youngest lawyers in Nevada history after successfully taking the bar exam at age 23. In 2003, he began and served a short term as a Las Vegas municipal court judge after being appointed by Mayor Oscar B. Goodman. Apart from his success as one of the better known criminal defense attorneys in Las Vegas, he has become a regarded legal commentator, one of the most quoted authorities on Las Vegas, and a prolific radio commentator and writer on a variety of topics related to Las Vegas. Background Figler graduated from the University of the Pacific ‚Äì McGeorge School of Law in 1991. At McGeorge he served as student body president. He started his career in his hometown of Las Vegas, where his family relocated in 1971. Raised in Las Vegas, his unique perspective as a so- called ‚ÄúVegas kid‚Äù has produced numerous humor oriented anecdotes which have provided the fodder for hundreds of radio essays which have appeared on Las Vegas National Public Radio affiliate, KNPR, as well as NPR‚Äôs All Things Considered Program. He is also an alum of one of the longest running sketch college sketch comedy groups in the nation, Comedy Corner at the University of Arizona. In 2019, he was awarded the prestigious Medal of Justice honor from the Nevada State Bar. Dayvid Figler served as a congressional intern in Washington, D.C. for now Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid in 1987 and later completed an internship with the United States Attorneys office in Las Vegas. Upon graduation from law school, he worked for a number of unions and fellow high-profile criminal defense attorney, Dominic Gentile. Eventually, Figler took an associate position with the Clark County Special Public Defender's office where he exclusively represented indigents charged with murder, including those facing the death penalty. It is in this office where he began a professional relationship with noted Las Vegas attorney, Kristina Wildeveld that continues to this day. He has been cited and quoted as a noted legal expert in many places including the New York Times, National Public Radio, Newsweek, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times. High profile cases Donte Johnson Figler's first case of note was defending against the death penalty prosecution of Donte Johnson, a California gang member who directed the kidnapping and execution style murders of four young men in Las Vegas in 1998. The four young men were followers of the band, Phish, and the stated motive for their killing was an attempt to steal money the men had made on the road with Phish. At trial, evidence was presented that Johnson was responsible for a number of other murders and attempt murders. The jury, however, did not impose the death penalty after Figler's impassioned closing argument. Later, a 3-judge panel of judges imposed the death penalty. Arguing one of the first cases in the country in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2000 ruling in Apprendi v. New Jersey, Figler successfully advocated the landmark case and in a published opinion, the 3-judge death panels of Nevada were ruled unconstitutional and the Court vacated the imposition of the death penalty. JOHNSON V. STATE, 118 Nev. Adv. Op. No. 79 (12/18/02) Gloria Guzman As a lawyer, Figler was first showcased before a national audience on CourtTV (later TruTV) after the gavel-to-gavel coverage of the trial of Gloria Guzman in 2006. There, Guzman was a nurse caretaker who fell in love with and married one of her charges in a facility who was also a quadriplegic. The two moved out of the facility and into an apartment where they engaged in a destructive lifestyle involving methamphetamine and guns. When her husband drowned in a bathtub, Guzman was accused of first degree murder. Midtrial, Figler discovered that the police had falsified the transcript of her confession and a hasty plea bargain later the previously incarcerated Guzman was given credit for time served. This case marked the first of numerous appearances for Figler on the Nancy Grace program both as a guest and a commentator.Nancy Grace, CNN Headline News, Plea Deal in Nevada The Nancy Grace appearances led to a number of guest appearances on other TruTV programs including Star Jones, Best Defense with Jami Floyd and Courtside with Ashley Banfield and Jack Ford where he primarily offered day-to-day coverage on O.J. Simpson's kidnapping trial.Friess, Steve The New York Times September 15, 2008 O.J. Simpson once acquitted of murder, now on trial for robbery, kidnapping Thad Aubert While on its face an insignificant case of first degree case kidnapping and robbery with use a deadly weapon, it was during this trial that Figler and his frequent co-counsel, Daniel M. Bunin, brought to light a long- standing practice of the Clark County District Attorney's office of compensating witnesses for appearing in their private offices. Causing a controversy within the legal community that is ongoing, the footnote to the case is that Figler and Bunin were able to secure a full acquittal from the jury after only 15 minutes of deliberation. In the case of Gary Miller some four years later, the issue was raised again by Figler and Bunin, and again they secured a full acquittal of 20 felony counts of sexual assault. The District Attorney announced that after 20 years of doing it, they were ending this \\"inappropriate\\" practice. Radio, writing and arts Beginning with the first of two Fellowships from the Nevada State Council for the Arts in 1997 for performance poetry (the other came in 2001 for fiction), Figler has embarked upon a creative life to run parallel with his law career. (He is the only multiple Fellowship winner in two distinct categories). A popular Nevada (former) slam poet and travelling urban storyteller, Figler has toured the United States at many festivals and events as a featured performer. . Most notably, since 1997, he has been featured at SxSW, Bumbershoot, North by Northwest, the National Poetry Slam competition, the Porchlight storytelling series in San Francisco, the Back Fence PDX storytelling series in Portland, Oregon, HEEB storytelling and the SF Sketchfest 2011 & 2012\\\\. In Nevada, he tours as part of the Tumblewords initiative through the Nevada Arts Council bringing literary events to rural Nevada towns. In 1998, he created a one-man show called ‚ÄúDayvid Figler IS Jim Morrison in Hello I Love You, Where You Folks From?‚Äù. In 2006, he was named Best Las Vegas Poet by the readers of LV CityLife weekly. In October 2010, Figler took his storytelling experiences further by producing Las Vegas' premier storytelling series, The Tell. In 2000, he began as a featured commentator on radio station, KNPR in Las Vegas and his audio essays are archived under the banner ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Necessarily So‚Äù on the station's website. A number of those commentaries were broadcast nationally on NPR's All Things Considered. In 2002, 2003 and then again in 2005, his essays were named Best Radio Program by the Electronic Media Awards, Las Vegas‚Äô primary broadcast media awards. In 2003, he was also named Best Radio Personality by reader's poll of the Las Vegas Review Journal, Nevada's largest circulation daily paper. In 2010, the Vegas Valley Book Festival awarded the individual Crystal Bookmark Award to Figler for his lifelong contribution to the cause of literary awareness in Southern Nevada. A frequent contributor to Las Vegas weekly and monthly magazines, his first national magazine article was the main feature for the Politics issue of Heeb (magazine), where he profiled (former) Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman and he's since taken up writing legal creative non-fiction for nsfwcorp. ] In 2005, Portland small press, Future Tense, published his short fictional work of humor, GROPE, about two Las Vegas natives finding a connection in a strip club. Figler is a contributor to Las Vegas guidebooks, including Time Out and also has stories or poems in a number of anthologies including In the Shadow of the Strip (University of Nevada Press), Literary Nevada (University of Nevada Press), The Perpetual Engine of Hope (CityLife Books) Poetry Slam (Manic D Press) and Nevada: 150 years in the Silver State (University of Nevada Press). Rumors abound of a reunion of the seminal ‚Äúgoofcore‚Äù punk rock polka band, Tippy Elvis, where Figler served as lead vocalist and primary lyricist. Popular in Las Vegas in the mid-90s, the band did reunite for one show as a surprise to Figler on his 40th birthday and a second show in 2011 at the Artifice bar as part of the Neon Reverb Music Festival. During its heyday, Tippy Elvis was an opening act for Mojo Nixon, Boiled in Lead and Idiot Flesh.

Organization The Safina Center's mission is \\"Making the Case for Life on Earth,\\" by fusing scientific understanding, emotional connection, and a moral call to action. To do this, the Safina Center‚Äôs Staff and Fellows produce creative science-based works including books, photography, films, visual art, sound art, and spoken-word works, which are distributed through major publishers, major talk venues, popular media, radio, television, events, and publication in professional journals. The Safina Center was founded in 2003 by Dr. Carl Safina, (PhD in Ecology from Rutgers University), a MacArthur fellow and inaugural holder of the Endowed Chair for Nature and Humanity at Stony Brook University. The Safina Center's board members have backgrounds in publishing, science, art, and other fields. The Center is funded primarily by foundations and individual gifts, according to GuideStar charity reports. Areas of focus When it was founded in 2003, the Safina Center (then known as the Blue Ocean Institute), had a focus on ocean science and policy, primarily fish and fisheries. Over the next few years the organization‚Äôs focus widened as the increasing influence of climate-related issues such as global warming and ocean acidification made it necessary to address the global influence of energy, food production, material culture and the expanding human footprint on not just the ocean but on the living world generally. The Safina Center began wide exploration and interpretation of how humans are changing the living world, and what those changes mean for life-supporting systems, living nature, and people. As a result, the Center‚Äôs works range broadly through ecology generally, addressing the cognitive, emotional, and cultural lives of other species in their free-living populations; pollution, especially of plastics in the global ocean; deforestation; land use issues and defining wilderness; loss and preservation of natural habitats; trophy hunting; endangerment, recoveries, and abundance trends in free-living populations; zoos and conservation; human rights abuses in fisheries; as well as personal food choices and our food system generally. The broad portfolio of all the work is that any product that ‚Äúhelps make the case for Life on Earth‚Äù constitutes an appropriate area of inquiry, narrative, policy formulation, and expression for the Center‚Äôs Staff, Fellows and Creative Affiliates. A primary contributor to the Safina Center‚Äôs body of works is Carl Safina, founding president of the Center. He is the author of seven critically acclaimed books about the human connection to nature. His 2015 book, Beyond Words; What Animals Think and Feel, has been translated into a dozen languages. The New York Times calls Safina‚Äôs bestselling book ‚Äúfascinating and expansive‚Ä¶ Safina is a terrific writer, majestic and puckish in equal measure.‚Äù In April 2019, Beyond Words was adapted into the first of a two-part series for young readers, called Beyond Words; What Elephants and Whales Think and Feel. Safina is widely published in scientific journals such as Animal Sentience, PNAS, and Science, where recent subjects have included how fish experience pain and loss of oxygen in the oceans. His writings on humanity and nature appear in popular publications such as The New York Times, The Guardian, CNN and others. His books and writing have earned Safina various prizes such as a MacArthur Genius Grant, Pew Fellowship, Guggenheim Fellowship, Orion and Academy literary awards, as well as John Burroughs, James Beard, and George Rabb Medals. He has been a four-time finalist for the Indianapolis Prize for conservation. Fellows‚Äô works also focus on the human connection to nature, across a wide spectrum of themes. Paul Greenberg, award-winning author and essayist who is currently a Safina Center Fellow, is focused on the issue of sustainable fishing and ocean conservation. He has published three books: most recently, The Omega Principle: Seafood and the Quest for a Long Life and Healthier Planet, in addition to American Catch: The Fight for Our Local Seafood and Four Fish: The Future of the Last Wild Food. Four Fish ‚Äúis not only the best analysis I‚Äôve seen of the current state of both wild and farmed fish ‚Äì it‚Äôs a terrific read,‚Äù writes American food journalist Mark Bittman. Greenberg has spoken in live events and on radio programs such as NPR‚Äôs Fresh Air with Terry Gross, and in a TED Talk, which has been viewed more than 1.5 million times. He has written widely about the human connection to fish and the oceans in publications such as The Guardian and The New York Times. The Center‚Äôs works are not only meant to communicate science but also ignite a call to action. For example, as a Safina Center Fellow, Hob Osterlund, MSN, APRN, writer, photographer and conservationist, published her first book Holy Moli: Albatross and Other Ancestors. Reviewers such as Terry Tempest Williams, award-winning author of Refuge: An Unnatural History of Family and Place says, ‚ÄúHob Osterlund is a witness to beauty. Her words ground that sacred witnessing on the page with joyous revelations, not without sorrow. The full range of emotion is hers. I look forward to her ongoing relationship of wonder with the albatross.‚Äù In addition to her book and writings in popular media, Osterlund photographs albatrosses and works in on-the-ground conservation efforts in Kauai, Hawaii, through the Kauai Albatross Network, and has created a documentary film about the life of a young Laysan albatross. Other Fellows have turned to music to communicate their messages about humans and nature. These include sound artist and educator Ben Mirin and clarinetist and philosopher David Rothenberg, who are both currently Safina Center Fellows. Mirin, who is also a National Geographic Explorer, records birdsongs, which he mixes and beat boxes along with. In 2018 Mirin debuted an interactive online game called ‚ÄúBeastBox,‚Äù which allows players to ‚Äútake sound recordings of wild creatures and transform them into loops, creating a wide variety of song clips. Players also learn about the animals and the habitats they live in,‚Äù Mongabay News explains in its review of the game. Rothenberg, on the other hand, most often plays his clarinet along to the live music of birds, whales and other creatures, which he records in audio and video. Rothenberg has been a prolific and noted music producer ‚Äú‚Ä¶16 albums, three books, a documentary film, and international acclaim have brought Rothenberg‚Äôs work to the front of contemporary sound,‚Äù the Harvard Gazette writes. His latest works, released in April 2019, include a new book, film and musical collection titled Nightingales in Berlin: Searching for the Perfect Sound, which document his work playing live music with nightingales in Berlin, Germany. Other Safina Center Fellows have a tighter focus on science. Katarzyna Nowak, wildlife scientist and current Safina Center Fellow, has established a citizen science program called the Mountain Goat Molt Project to collect data that she hopes will uncover how climate change is affecting the way wild goats grow their coats. She‚Äôs also helped develop the Request A Woman Scientist database. ‚ÄúLiz McCullagh, Katarzyna Nowak, and Jane Zelikova created the platform so that any time someone needs a scientist to speak, collaborate on a project, or share expertise, they‚Äôre connected with an extensive multidisciplinary network of vetted women in science,‚Äù writes Bitch Media, which honored Nowak, McCullagh and Zelikova in their Bitch 50 List of the most impactful women of 2018. In 2017, the Center launched a new Fellows program for early-career conservationists called the Safina Center ‚ÄúKalpana Chawla ‚ÄòLaunchpad‚Äô Fellowship. Recipients of this award include writers, lawyers, scientists and artists working on various projects across the globe. Notable works from Safina Center ‚ÄúKalpana Chawla ‚ÄòLaunchpad‚Äô Fellows‚Äù include Erica Cirino‚Äôs photojournalism covering the story of plastic pollution and Kate Thompson‚Äôs award-winning PhD work on medical anthropology in Africa. Accompanying Safina and the Fellows are a list of Creative Affiliates whose work is also united with the Center‚Äôs mission. The Safina Center‚Äôs list of Creative Affiliates includes notable figures with many different approaches to communicating the need for conservation, such as actress, author and creator of ‚ÄúGreen Porno‚Äù Isabella Rossellini, environmental philosopher and writer Kathleen Dean Moore, and musician and musical adventurer Paul Winter. Education efforts At nearby Stony Brook University, Dr. Safina is an endowed professor in the university‚Äôs School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. The organization is also engaged there in teaching and working with students. Safina, Safina Center Fellows and Creative Affiliates often give lectures or hold workshops, often for young people, sharing information about their work with the Center, with the public.

Huntzinger was born on 8 Jan 1943 in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. He was a member of the Socialist Party in the 1980s. From February 1983 to September 1985, Huntzinger was a vice president of the Confederation of Socialist Parties of the European Community and chair of its manifesto working group. During the 1980s, he was also instrumental in transitioning the French Socialist Party from a disarmament to an anti-totalitarian position. During the late 1990s, Huntzinger was the French ambassador to Macedonia and was heavily involved in international efforts to address various Balkan issues, including the Kosovo War. At the request of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, Huntzinger organized initial \\"Mediterranean Forums\\" for non-governmental entities from Algeria, France, Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, and Tunisia. These forums were held during February 1988 (Marseilles) and May 1989 (Tangier) and resulted in the creation of the 5+5 Dialogue of the Western Mediterranean Forum for foreign ministers from Algeria, France, Italy, Libya, Malta, Mauritania, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, and Tunisia. Huntzinger was instrumental in organizing the first 5+5 Dialogue held in 1990. This effort was dampened by the Gulf War, Algerian Civil War and the Lockerbie and UTA airplane bombings, but the 5+5 Dialogue has recovered to become a significant regional forum. Huntzinger also coordinated the Mediterranean Cultural Forum in 2008 and engaged in numerous other efforts to encourage dialogue among Mediterranean constituents.

They are named after the Italian collector Giampietro Campana, who first published these reliefs (1842). The reliefs were used as friezes at the top of a wall below the roof, and in other exterior locations, such as ridge tiles and antefixes, but also as decoration of interiors, typically with a number of sections forming a horizontal frieze. They were produced in unknown quantities of copies from moulds and served as decoration for temples as well as public and private buildings, as cheaper imitations of carved stone friezes. They originated in the terracotta tiled roofs of the Etruscan temples. A wide variety of motifs from mythology and religion featured on the reliefs as well as images of everyday Roman life, landscapes and ornamental themes. Originally they were painted in colour, of which only traces of this occasionally remain. They were mainly produced in the region of Latium around the city of Rome, and their use was also largely limited to this area. Five distinct types were produced. Today examples are found in almost all major museums of Roman art worldwide.  History of research  With intensified excavation in the Mediterranean in the nineteenth century, terracotta reliefs increasingly came to light in and around Rome, from which original architectural contexts were determined. Metal and marble objects had previously been the most sought by excavators, scholars and collectors, but at this time artefacts in other materials received wider interest, beginning with the late-18th century appreciation of Greek vases which when they first appeared were thought to represent Etruscan pottery. Photo of Giampietro Campana (c.1857/58) The first collector to make the tiles items of interest was marchese Giampietro Campana. His influence and contemporary reputation in archaeology was so great that he was named an honorary member of the Instituto di corrispondenza archeologica. He published his collection in 1842 in Antiche opere in plastica (\\"Ancient works in plastic arts\\"), in which his findings on the reliefs were first laid out in a scholarly fashion. Thus the tiles became known as Campana reliefs. Afterwards Campana was sentenced to imprisonment for embezzlement: in 1858 he lost his honorary membership in the Istituto di corrispondenza archeologica and his collection was pawned and sold. The terracotta reliefs owned by him are now in the Louvre in Paris, the British Museum in London and the Hermitage in St Petersburg. Other collectors, such as August Kestner, also collected the reliefs and fragments of them in greater numbers. Today examples are found in most larger collections of Roman archaeological finds, though the majority of the reliefs are in Italian museums and collections. View of the display of Campana's collection in the second edition of his Antiche opere in plastica (1851). The \\"Campana reliefs\\" are on long sequences on the walls. Despite Campana's research, for a long time the reliefs were rather neglected. They were viewed as handicrafts, thus inherently inferior, and not art, like marble sculptures. The idea that they should be treated as important sources for the craftwork of the period, for decorative fashions, and for their iconography only achieved prominence in the early years of the twentieth century. In 1911 Hermann von Rohden and Hermann Winnefeld published Architektonische R√∂mische Tonreliefs der Kaiserzeit (\\"Roman Architectural Clay Reliefs of the Imperial Period\\") with a volume of images in Reinhard Kekul√© von Stradonitz's series Die antiken Terrakotten. This was the first attempt to organise and classify the reliefs according to the emerging principles of Art history. The two authors first distinguished the main types, discussed their use and considered their development, style, and iconography. The book remains fundamental. Thereafter, apart from the publication of new finds, interest flagged for more than fifty years. In 1968 Adolf Heinrich Borbein's thesis Campanareliefs. Typologische und Stilkritische Untersuchungen (\\"Campana Reliefs: Typological and Stylistic Investigations\\") brought these archaeological finds to wider attention. In his work, Borbein was able to establish the development of the Campana reliefs from their origins among Etruscan-Italiote terracotta tiles. He also dealt with the use of motifs and templates derived from other media and pointed out that the artisans thereby produced creative new works. Since Borbein's publication, researchers have mainly devoted themselves to chronological aspects or the preparation of catalogues of material from recent excavations and publications of old collections. In 1999 Marion Rauch produced an iconographic study Bacchische Themen und Nilbilder auf Campanareliefs (\\"Bacchic Themes and Nile Images in Campana Reliefs\\") and in 2006 Kristine B√∏ggild Johannsen described the usage contexts of the tiles in Roman villas on the basis of recent archaeological finds. She showed that the reliefs were among the most common decorations of Roman villas from the middle of the first century BC until the beginning of the second century AD, both in the country houses of the nobility and in the essentially agricultural villae rusticae.On the history of scholarship on the Campana reliefs, see: Anne Viola Siebert: Geschichte(n) in Ton. R√∂mische Architekturterrakotten. Schnell + Steiner, Regensburg 2011, (Museum Kestnerianum 16), p. 19‚Äì21.  Material, technique, production, and painting  The quality of the ceramic product depended principally on the quality and processing of the clay. Particular importance attached to the tempering, when the clay (of uniform consistency) had various additives mixed in: sand, chopped straw, crushed brick, or even volcanic pozzolan. These additives minimised the contraction of the tile as it dried so that it retained its shape and did not develop cracks. These additives can be recognised as little red, brown, or black flecks, especially noticeable when crushed brick is used.

Satyrs harvesting grapes on a ridge tile in the Museum August Kestner, Hannover: Coloured reconstruction Satyrs harvesting grapes on a ridge tile in the Museum August Kestner, Hannover: Original The tiles were not individually made as unique artworks but as series. From an original relief (the punch) a mould in the shape of a negative was produced. Then the moist clay was pressed into these moulds. Probably the image and the framing decoration were formed separately, since framing decoration is seen which has been applied to various designs. After they had dried, the tiles were removed from the mould and possibly lightly reworked. Then they were fired. After firing and cooling, the terracotta was painted,On the painting, see von Rohden and Winnefeld 1911, p. 26‚Äì29 though sometimes the paint was applied before firing. Usually the reliefs received a coating, which acted as a surface for painting. This could be white paint or grey-yellow paint in Augustan times but it could also be stucco. At present, no canonical, prescribed use of colours can be detected, except that at least from Augustan times the background was usually in light blue regardless of the scenes and motifs, but it could include two or more other colours as well. The colour of human skin was usually in something between dark red and hot pink. In Dionysiac scenes, skin could also be painted a reddy-brown. In Augustan times light yellow was not unusual for skin. At Hannover, violet-brown, reddy brown, purple, red, yellow, yellow-brown, turquoise-green, dark bown, pink, blue, black, and white can all be identified.Siebert 2011 p. 30. Today the paint is lost in almost all cases and only residual traces can be recognised.  Distribution and dating  Relief with Dionysiac imagery: an ecstatic satyr (Louvre Museum) Nearly all Campana reliefs are from Central Italy, especially Latium. The largest and most important workshops seem to have been in Latium, especially in the neighbourhood of the city of Rome. Outside Latium the tiles are found mostly in Campania and in the former Etruscan sphere. At the end of the 1990s Marion Rauch compiled the reliefs with Dionysiac-Bacchic themes and was able to confirm this range for the motifs she was investigating. Nile scenesThe most famous example of this genre is the Nile mosaic of Palestrina. are found only in Latium. No pieces have been found in the Greek areas of southern Italy or in Sicily.Rauch 1999, p. 202, 269 An example from the Akademisches Kunstmuseum in Bonn, showing a Nike killing a bull was allegedly found in Agia Triada in Greece.Inventory # D 205; Harald Mielsch: R√∂mische Architekturterrakotten und Wandmalereien im Akademischen Kunstmuseum Bonn. Mann, Berlin 1971, , p. 12 Nr. 7 Some stuccoed examples derive from the western part of the Roman empire, the ancient regions of Hispania and Gaul (modern Spain and France).Rauch 1999, p. 2 The earliest Campana reliefs were made in the middle of the first century BC, during the final period of the Roman Republic, and they were most common in the first quarter of the first century AD. At this time, the reliefs experienced not only their greatest extent but also their greatest variety of motifs. The final reliefs derive from about two hundred years later - production and use stopped in the time of Hadrian. While this general dating is largely viewed as secure, the exact date of the individual pieces can rarely be given. A relative chronology might be determined on the basis of comparison of motifs and styles. Iconographic research is unhelpful for this purpose because the motifs derive from a traditional repertoire, which was used largely without variation over a long period of time. Motifs from daily life are more helpful, however, since some of them depict datable building work such as the Capitoline Temple, which was built in AD 82 and is depicted on a relief from the Louvre Museum,Inventory number 3839 providing a terminus ante quem for that tile. Curetes dancing around baby Zeus in Roscher's Ausf√ºhrliches Lexikon der griechischen und r√∂mischen Mythologie A better aid to dating is the quality of the clay. Over time their consistency became coarser, looser, more granular, and also lighter. The ornamental trimmings of the tiles are also useful: because they were the same for whole series of motifs, so one can reconstruct their relationships in the workshops and suggest contemporaneity. Very common motifs like the Ionian cymatium and palmettes are of only limited use, because these were used by a wide variety of workshops, even at the same time. Finally, size comparisons can also help with dating. Moulds were not only made from the original punch, but also often from tiles themselves. This leads to a natural \\"shrinkage\\" of the new tiles' dimensions. Because the moulds were sometimes reused for long periods of time, there are sometimes noticeable changes in the size of the tiles. For the motif depicting the Curetes performing a weapon dance around the baby Zeus, the moulds can be traced over a period of 170 years. In the process, the tiles lost about 40% of their size as a result of the repeated reuse of completed tiles as moulds. Therefore, in tiles which share a motif, the smaller can be identified as the younger. The motif also lost clarity through repeated remoulding.  Types and use  Even when it is known exactly where a relief tile was found, there is no absolute certainty because to this day no tiles have been found in the place of their original use. Scholars largely agree that the tiles served decorative and practical functions, although it is uncertain exactly which part of the building they were placed on.Kristine B√∏ggild Johannsen, \\"Campanareliefs im Kontext. Ein Beitrag zur Neubewertung der Funktion und Bedeutung der Campanareliefs in r√∂mischen Villen,\\" Facta 22 (2008), p. 15‚Äì38 Their origin in Etruscan-Italiote temple architecture is clear and certain, but it can nevertheless be assumed that temples were not the primary usage context at least in the tiles' later phases. On account of their consistently modest scale, the reliefs were more suitable for close viewing, which implies use on smaller buildings. Whereas their Etruscan and Italiote precursors served to cover wooden temple roofs and protect them from weathering, the Campana reliefs seem to have been used far more in secular contexts. There they lost their protective functions and became wall decorations. For a time both forms of use were found side by side on temples, until finally the Campana reliefs lost their older use. On account of their fragility, the bricks must have been replaced often - it is suggested that this would have occurred once every twenty-five years or so. At first they were replaced with copies of the previous decorative tiles, but later newer motifs were substituted also. Increasingly from the first century stone temples replaced earlier buildings in wood, and Campana reliefs were only used in restorations.Siebert 2011 p. 24‚Äì26 Two griffins facing each other from a Sima in the Museum August Kestner, Hannover Antefix in the Museum August Kestner in Hannover: Front view of a Siren with outstretched wings Campana reliefs can be arranged on five bases: chronology, geography, iconography, shape and use.Siebert 2011 p. 23 The most productive system is classification based on the shape of the tile. The categories used are cladding tiles, ridge tiles, sima tiles, crowning tiles and antefixes. * Cladding tiles: On the upper border, where the tile forms a smooth edge, there was decoration with an egg and dart pattern and the lower border is decorated with Lotus, palmettes, and anthemia. The lower edge follows the contour of the decorative pattern. There were three or four holes in each tile, through which tiles were tied to the wall.Siebert 2011 p. 24 * Sima and Crowning tiles belong together. They were connected by use of the Tongue and groove method. On top of the sima was a tongue which was inserted into the underside of the crowning tile. The sima joined the cladding tile with an egg and dart pattern, a smooth strip was left on the underside. Waterspouts could be incorporated into the sima. The crowning tiles usually feature ornamental, floral patterns. They were equipped with slots on the underside, into which the sima was inserted. Together, the two tile types found use as the eaves of the roof.Siebert 2011 p. 24‚Äì25 * Ridge tiles' were decorated with the same reliefs as the cladding tiles. They were finished on the upper side by a palmette and anthemion pattern and shared their shape, but lacked holes. On the lower side they were equipped with slots like the crowning tiles. These tiles were intended for interior decoration, where they could form longer friezes.Siebert 2011 p. 25 * Antefixes sat on or above the eaves, the lowest row of tiles and closed off the front opening. They were composed of two parts. The curved tile was placed over the bricks of the eave, while the front portion closed the roof cavity off with a vertical tile. These tiles can be decorated and were often painted.Siebert 2011 p. 25‚Äì26 These terracotta tiles had parallels in their development with the marble decorative reliefs of the \\"neo-Attic form\\" of the Late Republic and Early Empire, though their dissimilar shapes were not necessarily mutually dependent. Both had their own unique types and themes. In production and presentation, the marble reliefs were single works, while the Campana reliefs were made in series and once place in a united frieze did not operate as a single work.Siebert 2011 p. 26  Motifs  Remains of a waterspout of a Sima in the Museum August Kestner in Hannover: mask with light damage The Campana reliefs show great diversity in their motifs. However, the images can be grouped into four large categories: * Mythological themes: in turn divisible into three categories. Firstly, the Homeric epics with the Trojan War and the events which followed (such as the Odyssey. Secondly, the deeds of heroes, especially Heracles, but also Theseus and others. Thirdly, Dionysiac themes. * Landscapes, especially scenes of the Nile * Daily life: depictions of day-to- day Roman life as well as less frequent events like Triumphs. They include depictions of the theatre, the palaestra, the circus and even prisoners. * Ornamental images including not just completely ornamental designs, such as vines, but also masks and gorgon heads. The Egyptian elements in many tiles are of particular interest, such as the cladding tiles held in the British MuseumFragment of terracotta Campana relief: imitation Hieroglyphs, Egyptian- style figure to left and in the Museum August Kestner in Hannover, which include crude imitations of Egyptian hieroglyphs - rarely encountered in Roman art.Christian E.

Following the democratization process of the early 1990s, which proved largely abortive, Eyadema and his ruling party, the Rally of the Togolese People (RPT), successively won all presidential elections, although those elections were always extremely controversial: the opposition boycotted the 1993 presidential election altogether, and it claimed that Eyadema won the 1998 presidential election and the 2003 presidential election only through fraud. Eyadema died in 2005 and his son Faure Gnassingb√© then ran as the RPT candidate; although he officially won the election, the opposition again disputed the result, and serious violence erupted. Ahead of the 2010 election, the Togolese government took steps to increase the credibility of the electoral process and reassure the international community that the election would be free and fair. It placed a particular priority on avoiding the violence that marred the 2005 election. Gnassingb√© stood for a second term as the candidate of the RPT, while the UFC designated Fabre as its candidate due to health problems suffered by its President, Gilchrist Olympio. Although the UFC was the largest opposition party by a large measure, and although the election was to be decided in a single round on a first past the post basis, the other opposition parties largely refused to rally behind Fabre and chose to nominate their own candidates. Provisional results showed Gnassingb√© winning the election with 61% of the vote, while Fabre trailed with 34%. The opposition again alleged fraud, denouncing the method by which the results were transmitted to the electoral commission, and subsequently held regular protests in Lom√©. The results were confirmed by the Constitutional Court and Gnassingb√© was sworn in for a second term on 3 May 2010. Background The election was conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI).EU gives Togo grant for presidential election AFP, 23 December 2009 The 17 members of CENI were sworn in on 1 September 2009; it was composed of five representatives of the ruling Rally of the Togolese People (RPT), five representatives of the parliamentary opposition, three representatives of the extra-parliamentary opposition, three representatives of civil society, and one representative of the administration.Les membres de la C√©ni ont pr√™t√© serment Republicoftogo.com, 1 September 2009 Henri Kolani, a representative of the extra-parliamentary opposition, was then elected as President of CENI, but the parliamentary opposition objected to his election. At a press conference on 18 September 2009, Kolani announced an electoral schedule: preparations for the election would begin in October 2009, the official election campaign period would run from 13 to 26 February 2010, and the election would be held on 28 February 2010. He stressed that hard work was necessary to ensure that the election was held before the constitutional deadline. The parliamentary opposition ignored Kolani's announcement.Togo to hold presidential election in February 2010 Xinhua, 19 September 2009 The controversy over the election of Kolani interfered with CENI's work, and as a result, Issifou Tabiou Taffa--a representative of civil society--was elected by consensus as President of CENI on 14 October 2009, resolving the controversy.Le pr√©sident nouveau est arriv√© !

On 23 December 2009, the European Union announced a grant of six billion CFA francs (9.1 million euro) to Togo in order to facilitate the organization of \\"free, just, transparent and peaceful elections, in line with international standards\\" and to \\"strengthen the capacities\\" of CENI and the High Authority for the Audiovisual Sector and Communications for future elections. As the election drew nearer, greater government activity and social spending was observed; infrastructure was built or improved and recruitment to the civil service was increased. Speaking on TVT on 30 December 2009, Pascal Bodjona, the Minister of State for Territorial Administration, said that the government was merely doing what was best for the people and that the government's work was unrelated to the election.Bodjona : \\"On va continuer √† faire ce qui est bien pour les populations\\" Republicoftogo.com, 31 December 2009 The EU committed to sending an additional five billion CFA francs at a meeting with the Togolese government on 22 January 2010,Nouvelle aide de l'UE pour l'√©lection Republicoftogo.com, 23 January 2010 and it announced on 1 February that it would have 122 observers present for the election.Le RPT d√©nonce l‚Äôattitude de l‚Äôopposition Republicoftogo.com, 1 February 2010 On 11 February 2010, the election was delayed from 28 February to 4 March at the request of the opposition. As a result of the delay, the campaign period was modified and set to run from 16 February to 2 March. CENI President Tabiou Taffa announced the official opening of the campaign, set to begin at midnight, on 15 February. In his statement, he said that revisions of the voter list had produced \\"a reliable voter list of 3,295,646 voters\\".

Speaking on the occasion, RPT Secretary-General Solitoki Esso credited Gnassingb√© with vast accomplishments, saying that--among other things--he had improved the political atmosphere, organized transparent elections, ended Togo's international isolation, and revitalized the economy. He also credited Gnassingb√© with various accomplishments in the areas of health, education, infrastructure, employment, and social welfare. Agb√©yom√© Kodjo, a former Prime Minister leading the opposition Organisation to Build a United Togo (OBUTS), submitted his candidacy to CENI on 14 January 2010. Although the deadline for the submission of candidacies was 15 January, Kodjo was the first person to formally submit his candidacy. Upon learning that he was first, Kodjo declared that it was \\"a very good sign\\" and that he would also be \\"the first\\" to be declared the winner of the election.Kodjo super optimiste Republicoftogo.com, 14 January 2010 Kodjo fiercely denounced Gnassingb√©'s \\"disastrous\\" record, saying that the state budget needed to be increased, and he pledged \\"no fewer than 21 emergency measures to restore confidence and boost consumer spending after the presidential election\\".Agb√©yom√© Kodjo : ¬´ L'absence de Gilchrist est lourde de sens ¬ª Republicoftogo.com, 21 January 2010 On 15 January, long-time opposition leader Yawovi Agboyibo was formally invested as the candidate of the CAR.Agboyibo, le retour Republicoftogo.com, 15 January 2010 Eight candidates submitted applications to CENI by the deadline of 15 January: Gnassingb√© as the RPT candidate, Jean-Pierre Fabre as the UFC candidate, Agboyibo as the CAR candidate, Kodjo as the OBUTS candidate, Adjamagbo-Johnson as the CDPA candidate, Nicolas Lawson as the PRR candidate, Yamgnane as the Sursaut candidate, and Kagbara as the PDP candidate. The candidates were predictable except for Fabre, whose designation as the UFC candidate was considered very surprising.Huit candidats ont d√©pos√© leur dossier Republicoftogo.com, 16 January 2010 UFC President Olympio, whose candidacy had long been announced and expected, was in the United States at the time, suffering from backache, and was unable to travel to Togo to undergo the necessary medical review for his candidacy. Consequently, the UFC submitted the candidacy of its Secretary-General, Jean-Pierre Fabre. Aside from Olympio, two candidacies were rejected: those of Dahuku P√©r√© and Kokou S√©gnon Nsoukpoe. According to CENI, neither of them submitted the necessary deposits of money.La C√©ni au rapport Republicoftogo.com, 21 January 2010 In a letter published on the UFC website on 16 January, Olympio said that the election should not be rushed and that CENI should be given \\"the time necessary for the preparation of a credible and transparent election\\".

B√¢tissons la Cit√©. UFC website, 16 January 2010 On 2 February 2010, the Constitutional Court validated the candidacies of seven of the eight candidates who were initially accepted by CENI. The only candidate rejected by the Constitutional Court was Kofi Yamgnane, who held joint dual nationality: the Court cited a contradiction between the date of birth given in his French documents (11 October 1945) and the date given in his Togolese documents (31 December 1945). According to the Court, the contradiction was \\"of a nature to cause confusion over the identity of the person and consequently to weaken the legal and judicial security inherent in the highest office in the country\\".Togo rejects presidential bid of ex-French minister AFP, 2 February 2010Yamgnane recal√© Republicoftogo.com, 2 February 2010 Yamgnane denounced the ruling, claiming its real motivation was to exclude \\"the most dangerous candidate for the RPT\\". Initially he vowed to appeal, but that was impossible because the judgments of the Constitutional Court were final; he then said that his only recourse was to \\"mobilize the street\\". He also said that, although the RPT imagined that it would \\"remain in power eternally\\", \\"we have the means to ensure that change happens in 2010 in Togo\\".Kofi Yamgnane : ¬´ La bataille est perdue, mais la guerre continue ¬ª Republicoftogo.com, 3 February 2010 PRR President Nicolas Lawson, who was confirmed as a candidate, expressed his willingness to work with whichever candidate won the election. He also praised the peaceful atmosphere and harshly denounced the UFC President, saying that Olympio \\"always embodied violence, malice, and revenge, and I am very happy that he is not a candidate because his influence on Togo was fatal\\".Nicolas Lawson : ¬´ La faute √† Gilchrist ¬ª Republicoftogo.com, 3 February 2010 Reacting to the Constitutional Court's decision to validate his candidacy, UFC Secretary- General Fabre said that it was \\"unquestionably a message of hope for the Togolese people who aspire to a profound change\\". He also stressed that Olympio \\"embodies, more than any other, the ideals and values of our party\\" and that his own candidacy represented a commitment to continuing Olympio's work. Seeking to give the impression of solidarity amidst perceptions of internal disagreement, UFC First Vice-President Patrick Lawson said that the party was totally united behind Fabre's candidacy.L‚ÄôUFC ¬´ unie et solidaire ¬ª, selon Patrick Lawson Republicoftogo.com, 3 February 2010 Speaking on 9 February, Yamgnane said that he would meet six candidates (all except Gnassingb√©) in Paris with the goal of reaching an agreement on a single opposition candidate, which would increase the opposition's chances of defeating Gnassingb√©. He said that it would be most intuitive to select Fabre as the single candidate, although he stressed that was a \\"logical preference\\" rather than a \\"personal preference\\".Pr√©sidentielles au Togo: Kofi Yamgnane veut un candidat unique de l'opposition AFP, 9 February 2010 The meeting of candidates was facilitated by Fran√ßois Boko, a former Interior Minister. It was largely unsuccessful, however, as the CAR candidate Agboyibo and the CDPA candidate Adjamagbo-Johnson both abandoned the effort. In a statement on 9 February, CDPA Secretary-General L√©opold Gnininvi condemned the \\"cavalier\\" way the meeting was conducted, expressing annoyance that it was taken for granted that the candidates would all rally behind Fabre.La r√©union de Paris se solde par un √©chec Republicoftogo.com, 9 February 2010 Despite the failure to reach a consensus among the candidates, Agb√©yom√© Kodjo decided to withdraw his candidacy and rally behind Fabre, while Yamgnane also backed Fabre's candidacy. They agreed on the creation on a coalition called the Republican Front for Change and the Alternance to support Fabre; Kodjo was designated as the Front's campaign director, while Yamgnane was designated as its campaign spokesman. In an interview on 13 February, Jean-Claude Homawoo, who was one of the UFC's three representatives on CENI, insisted that Olympio was the legitimate UFC candidate because he, unlike Fabre, had been nominated by a party congress in 2008. He also claimed that the UFC was divided between Olympio loyalists and reformists, and he stated that he personally did not support Fabre's candidacy. According to Homawoo, Olympio was not suffering from an illness but rather was recovering from a fall down a flight of stairs, in which he broke his knee and bruised his back and neck. Kodjo, speaking on 14 February, also criticized the UFC's decision to withdraw from CENI work as well as the apparent dissension affecting the party leadership. He stressed that OBUTS did not support any boycott of the election.Agb√©yom√© dit non au boycott de la pr√©sidentielle Republicoftogo.com, 15 February 2010 Agboyibo and Adjamagbo-Johnson announced on 15 February 2010 that they were suspending their candidacies, citing their still unresolved concerns about the voter rolls.Opposition candidates withdraw from Togo poll AFP, 15 February 2010 Speaking on 15 February, PRR candidate Nicolas Lawson denounced the opposition, saying that Togo was cursed with the \\"most stupid and criminal opposition in the sub-region\\". According to Lawson, the opposition was a \\"band of thugs\\" with \\"no program and national vision\\" that \\"must disappear from the political landscape\\".¬´ Nous avons l‚Äôopposition la plus b√™te du monde ¬ª Republicoftogo.com, 15 February 2010 Kodjo, dissatisfied with the UFC's behavior, announced on 15 February that he was reactivating his candidacy.Il fera Front tout seul Republicoftogo.com, 15 February 2010 In an interview with the news agency Agence France-Presse in mid-February 2010, Faure Gnassingb√© stressed the importance of having a well-organized election free of violence. Acknowledging that the violence of the 2005 presidential election was \\"traumatic for many people\\", he said that the 2010 election would be a \\"big test\\" and that a victory under violent conditions would \\"almost be meaningless\\". Gnassingb√© also said he regretted the absence of Gilchrist Olympio in the election because Olympio had \\"a rightful place in politics.\\"Jacques Lhuillery, Togo's polls big test for legitimacy: president AFP, 20 February 2010 Campaign On 17 February, four minor opposition groups--ADDI, the Alliance, the Socialist Renewal Party (PSR), and SURSAUT-- joined the UFC in backing Fabre's candidacy. Together they reconstituted the opposition coalition as the Republican Front for the Alternance and Change (FRAC); Yamgnane remained its campaign spokesman, while Patrick Lawson was designated as campaign director. FRAC called on the CAR and OBUTS to join the coalition.Pour l‚Äô√©lection, Fabre met son Frac Republicoftogo.com, 17 February 2010 Fabre said in an interview on 17 February that the coalition represented a majority of the opposition's electorate and that, in reference to the other parties, \\"it is up to them to join us\\"; expressing some exasperation, he said that \\"the ego is so strong in Togo that everyone thinks he can be President\\". He nevertheless said discussions would continue with the other parties and also insisted, in reaction to suggestions that the UFC was divided, that Olympio supported his candidacy. Regarding the UFC's suspended participation in CENI, he said that the UFC representatives would return to the body because it would be preposterous to participate in the election while boycotting the electoral commission.Fabre : ¬´ M.

He urged everyone in Togo to respect the results.Faure : ¬´ Chacun esp√®re se retrouver premier √† l'arriv√©e ¬ª Republicoftogo.com, 2 March 2010 During the campaign, the RPT distributed rice at a cost far below market value (\\"Faure rice\\"). The rice distribution was interpreted by many as a way of bribing people to vote for Gnassingb√©. Fabre's supporters responded to the alleged bribery by chanting \\"we were not paid to be here\\" at campaign rallies. Bodjona, the Government Spokesman, dismissed the allegations of bribery; he said that the rice and other items were donated to the campaign by some of Gnassingb√©'s supporters.Rukmini Callimachi, Dictator's son winner of Togo election Associated Press, 6 March 2010 Gnassingb√©'s campaign posters and billboards were seemingly omnipresent in Lom√©, vastly outnumbering those from the opposition.

The two main opposition parties, the Union of the Forces of Change (UFC) and the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR), strongly protested the single-round system.Backache rules main opposition leader out of Togo vote AFP, 16 January 2010 UFC President Gilchrist Olympio insisted that the election should be held in two rounds, with the top two candidates in the first round proceeding to a second round. A two-round system could work to the UFC's benefit; as the main opposition party, its candidate might expect to place second in the first round and then win in the second round by obtaining the support of other opposition candidates who were defeated in the first round. (Abdoulaye Wade won the 2000 presidential election in Senegal in that manner.) Speaking before a crowd of hundreds of UFC supporters on 6 December 2009, Olympio warned that the UFC would not participate in the election if there was only one round and that \\"if the UFC does not participate, there will be no election in Togo.\\"Olympio : ¬´ Pour nous c‚Äôest deux tours ou rien ¬ª Republicoftogo.com, 7 December 2009 In addition to its demand for a two-round system, the opposition sought a decrease in the deposit that candidates were required to pay;Q&A;: Togo presidential election BBC News, 3 March 2010 the amount was equivalent to about 44,000 dollars. Another opposition demand was the revision of the voter rolls. On 25 January 2010, six opposition candidates and three parties called for a resumption of the revision of the voter rolls as well as a delay of the election; they also argued that Gnassingb√© was conducting an unofficial campaign before the start of the campaign period. Government Spokesman Pascal Bodjona dismissed the opposition concerns; he said that the voter rolls had been established prior to the 2007 parliamentary election and that it was up to CENI to decide whether to resume revising them. Regarding Gnassingb√©'s alleged unofficial campaigning, Bodjona argued that Gnassingb√©, as President, was merely working for the people: \\"he will not starve the people because of the electoral process\\". Bodjona additionally argued that the opposition only wanted a delay because they were unprepared for the election.Bodjona : ¬´ Faure ne m√®ne pas de campagne d√©guis√©e ¬ª Republicoftogo.com, 26 January 2010 In order to improve the voter rolls, CENI announced on 26 January that people could register to vote at a hundred points across the country on 31 January.R√©vision cibl√©e le 31 janvier Republicoftogo, 27 January 2010 RPT Secretary-General Solitoki Esso released a statement on 28 January in which he accused the opposition of using the issue of revising the voter rolls as a delaying tactic.Le RPT d√©nonce l‚Äôattitude de l‚Äôopposition Republicoftogo.com, 29 January 2010 At talks in Ouagadougou, mediated by Burkinab√© President Blaise Compaor√©, the RPT and the two main opposition parties--the UFC and the CAR--were unable to reach an agreement on opposition demands, the foremost of which was the revision of the voter rolls. The opposition also wanted a delay in the election, although Compaor√© felt that it was necessary to hold the vote \\"between 28 February and 5 March to stay within the constitutional timeframe\\".Respecter les d√©lais constitutionnels Republicoftogo.com, 10 February 2010 A slight delay was announced on 11 February, however, as the date was pushed back from 28 February to 4 March. Citing continuing concerns about the voter rolls and fears that the election would be a \\"masquerade\\",Opposition party quits Togo election body AFP, 13 February 2010 the UFC notified CENI that its three representatives on CENI were suspending their participation on 11 February. When announcing the UFC's decision, CENI stressed that \\"the electoral process is proceeding normally\\".La C√©ni confirme le retrait des repr√©sentants de l‚ÄôUFC Republicoftogo.com, 12 February 2010 One of the UFC's CENI representatives, Jean-Claude Homawoo, refused to accept his party's decision and said that he would continue his work on CENI unless Olympio told him to stop.Olympio victime d‚Äôun hold-up √©lectoral Republicoftogo.com, 13 February 2010 Corruption Vincent Bollor√©, a French billionaire close to then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy, allegedly gave financial support to presidential candidate Faure Gnassingb√© in the 2010 Togolese presidential election. He is suspected of having offered Gnassingb√© discount on advertisements from his ad agency, which he didn't equally offer to his opponent Jean-Pierre Fabre. Gnassingb√© went on to become Togolese president and gave Bollor√©'s company port concessions. Bollor√© formally denies any wrongdoing. Conduct In light of the violence that followed the 2005 election, it was particularly important to CENI that the election proceed peacefully. Speaking on 3 March, CENI President Taffa Tabiou noted that campaigning, which had concluded late on the previous day, was conducted amidst \\"calm and serenity\\", and he expressed CENI's commitment \\"to organising a just, fair and transparent election devoid of violence, to ensure that Togo ... finds its place in the comity of modern democracies\\".Togo election agency vows violence-free poll AFP, 3 March 2010 A peaceful vote was also strongly desired by the government and the RPT, which sought to avoid the opprobrium associated with perceptions of a flawed election and repression of the opposition. Togo had suffered from international isolation during the latter phase of President Eyadema's rule due to the widespread belief that he had rigged elections and employed violence against the opposition; the 2005 election, which followed Eyadema's death, served to only amplify those concerns, but afterward Eyadema's son made a concerted effort to project a better image internationally. The creation of an independent electoral commission was noted by the Western media, as was the \\"fair\\" coverage given by the government's news website to opposition candidates.Togo opposition claims 'irregularities' in poll BBC News, 5 March 2010 In light of the emphasis on having a peaceful vote, security forces had a heavy presence; 3,000 police and 3,000 gendarmes were assigned the task of preventing electoral violence. There were also efforts to educate voters in the prevention of electoral violence. Polls were open from 7:00 am (0700 GMT) to 5:00 pm (1700 GMT) on 4 March. Fabre, who voted in Lom√©, said on the occasion that \\"during the campaign, I went round the country and heard a distress call, a desire for change\\", and he warned the government to not rig the election: \\"The people will make sure their vote will not be changed.\\"Emile Kouton, Togo votes for leader, opposition warns against fraud AFP, 4 March 2010 Voting proceeded peacefully and without incident,Togo's ruling, opposition parties claim victory in vote AFP, 5 March 2010 but the UFC immediately began pointing to issues that it identified as irregularities, such as the absence of serial numbers on the ballot papers. Amidst an atmosphere of deep distrust, a post-election controversy rapidly developed regarding the means of transmitting results to CENI. Seeking to establish a reliable transmission method, a delegation from the European Union had met with Gnassingb√© on 3 March and obtained his last- minute agreement to use the VSAT satellite system to transmit the results directly from each polling station. CENI accepted the use of the satellite system alongside text messaging and faxing. However, following the vote, Taffa Tabiou said on 5 March that the VSAT machines had failed and that it would therefore be necessary for all 35 electoral district directors to bring physical proof of the results to Lom√©. That was unacceptable to the UFC, which said that results not transmitted through VSAT could not be trusted; it claimed that the machines had not failed but were simply switched off by the government.Rukmini Callimachi, Togo opposition says party ahead in president race Associated Press, 5 March 2010 Fabre held a press conference on 5 March to declare victory, claiming that he had won about 75-80% of the vote; he also accused the RPT of electoral fraud and said that the results being sent to CENI had no credibility.Togo opposition says party ahead in president race Associated Press, 5 March 2010 Later on the same day, Bodjona, the Government Spokesman, claimed that Gnassingb√© had won \\"resoundingly\\". Lom√© remained calm but also tense in the absence of official results. Some opposition supporters threatened violence if Fabre was not declared the winner and chanted \\"change or death\\". RPT Secretary-General Esso accused the UFC of making false claims about the results and said that it was laying the groundwork for violence. Despite the opposition's complaints, district officials followed Taffa Tabiou's instructions in bringing their results to Lom√©. Those results only indicated the total votes for each district; they did not include specific counts from each polling station, and the officials did not bring actual ballots. Jean-Claude Codjo, one of the opposition's representatives on CENI, argued the system was unacceptable because each set of results being presented to CENI merely constituted a \\"synthesis\\": \\"I have no way of knowing if these numbers that are being read out are real.\\"Rukmini Callimachi, Togo opposition doubts presidential vote count Associated Press, 6 March 2010 Codjo left the CENI meeting in protest,Togo police use tear gas on opposition protesters BBC News, 6 March 2010 along with another of the opposition's representatives. Results from 20 of the constituencies were counted by mid-day on 6 March, showing Gnassingb√© leading Fabre by a margin of 52% to 43%; the results followed the typical regional breakdown of elections in Togo, with the RPT dominating the north and the UFC receiving the bulk of its support in the south. Seeing that the results were going Gnassingb√©'s way, a group of Fabre's supporters protested in Lom√©, but the protest was broken up with tear gas.Laurence Boutreux, Togo's president re-elected: electoral chief AFP, 6 March 2010 Taffa Tabiou announced full provisional results late on 6 March. Those results showed Gnassingb√© winning the election with 60.9% of the vote (1,243,044 votes), far ahead of Fabre, who received 33.94% (692,584 votes). Yawovi Agboyibo trailed in a distant third place with 2.96%. According to Taffa Tabiou, voter turnout was 64.68%. Significantly, the turnout varied greatly by region: it was 70-80% in the north--the RPT's stronghold--but far lower in the traditionally pro-UFC south (including Lom√©). Jean-Claude Homawoo, an opposition representative on CENI, said that opposition supporters were totally disillusioned with the electoral process: \\"So many times we went and voted in elections we knew we had won, only for the opposite result to be declared. So people have become tired. They don't believe their vote counts anymore.\\" Esso, the RPT Secretary-General, described the result as \\"great victory that gives us a lot of satisfaction and wipes off any doubts about the process\\", while Bodjona dismissed the opposition as \\"bad losers\\". For its part, the EU observer mission released a report that noted the accusations of vote-buying by the RPT, but also suggested there was no evidence to support opposition claims of outright fraud.Rukmini Callimachi, Togo security blocks opposition headquarters Associated Press, 8 March 2010 Fabre alleged that the RPT had told his supporters that their fingerprints on the ballots could be traced and that they could therefore be hunted down and punished for their votes. He also repeated the accusations of vote-buying and \\"massive\\" fraud. Declaring that he was \\"ready to die\\", Fabre led a group of UFC supporters in a protest on 7 March: \\"We're going to make them exhaust their stock of tear gas. We cannot let this go on, otherwise they'll hang on to power for the next 200 years.\\" Although UFC supporters formed a protective cordon around Fabre, he was sprayed with tear gas and the protesters were forced to disperse, fleeing back to the UFC headquarters. Reacting to the previous day's protests, the security forces formed a blockade around UFC headquarters on 8 March. Fabre, trying to reach his office, was initially barred from entry, but after an hour he was allowed through the blockade. The UFC announced that it would hold a large protest on 9 March to press for a review of the results; however, the protest was thwarted by the police. Also on 9 March, Fabre alleged that the security forces searched the UFC headquarters, seized computers, and arrested party members, interfering with the party's efforts to prepare evidence of fraud.Scott Stearns, Togo's Opposition Leader: Police Seize Vote Fraud Evidence VOA News, 9 March 2010 Lawson, the PRR candidate, grudgingly accepted Gnassingb√©'s re-election on 8 March,Nicolas Lawson : ¬´ L'opposition a lamentablement √©chou√© ¬ª Republicoftogo.com, 9 March 2010 but he nevertheless alleged fraud: \\"The vote was so expertly stolen by the ruling party that electoral observers will never understand what really happened.\\"Scott Stearns, Togo Government Confident President's Win Will Stand Up to Challenge VOA News, 10 March 2010 Bassabi Kagbara, the PDP candidate, reacted to the official results--according to which he received only 0.41% of the vote--on 9 March; he said that he did not recognize the results, but also appealed for \\"calm and dialogue\\".Kagbara prend acte des r√©sultats Republicoftogo.com, 9 March 2010 In an interview on 11 March, Gilbert Bawara, the Minister of Cooperation, criticized Fabre. He said that Fabre should not expect the Togolese people to trust him when he did not trust others, and he argued that Fabre's claims of victory were ridiculous, noting that Fabre initially claimed a score of 75-80% but later claimed a lesser figure of 55-60%. According to Bawara, Gnassingb√© would consider the fact that Fabre had received a respectable number of votes; Bawara observed that Fabre's score of 34% was particularly impressive because he had not been envisioned as a presidential candidate before January 2010. However, he also said that Fabre lacked experience and did not do serious work in the National Assembly.Bawara : ¬´ Jean-Pierre Fabre se trompe d‚Äô√©poque ¬ª Republicoftogo.com, 11 March 2010 Supporters of Gnassingb√© and Fabre both held marches in Lom√© on 13 March. The marches were peaceful and did not confront one another, taking different paths through the city.Thousands march over Togo presidential vote AFP, 13 March 2010 Results On 18 March, the Constitutional Court confirmed the results and declared that Gnassingb√© had been elected President, rejecting five appeals from the opposition. The results confirmed by the Constitutional Court were nearly identical to those previously released by CENI, although both of the main candidates were credited with slightly reduced totals. Decisions of the Constitutional Court are not subject to appeal, and thus the decision of 18 March marked the conclusion of \\"all the electoral processes\\".Court in Togo confirms president's re-election AFP, 18 March 2010 Speaking on behalf of Fabre and the FRAC coalition, Patrick Lawson denounced the Constitutional Court's decision and described Fabre as \\"the elected President\\". He urged the people \\"to stand opposed to this electoral hold-up\\" and \\"remain mobilized until the restitution of power to Jean-Pierre Fabre\\". Aftermath In the period following the Court's decision, the FRAC coalition continued to hold protests on a weekly basis.Thousands protest over Togo's poll outcome AFP, 10 April 2010 A protest on 24 March 2010 was marked by clashes between the protesters and the police, and the opposition said that 30 people suffered injuries as a result.Police question some 70 people in Togo: opposition AFP, 15 April 2010 Thousands of Fabre's supporters participated in a protest held in Lom√© on 10 April 2010. Late on 14 April, the security forces prevented a planned candlelight vigil on the grounds that it had not received a permit. Around 70 people who were present at the UFC headquarters were detained and questioned. According to the security forces, the questioning was necessary because some of those present \\"were individuals from neighbouring countries\\" who intended \\"to breach public order\\". Tensions between the Fabre and Olympio factions of the UFC remained evident after the election. UFC militants, allegedly acting on instructions from Fabre and other UFC leaders, threw stones at a motorcade carrying Olympio to a protest in mid-April 2010, and Olympio, protected by security forces, then returned home. Some of those involved said that they had thrown stones because Jean-Claude Homawoo--the CENI representative who had, in the eyes of Fabre supporters, demonstrated disloyalty during the run-up to the election-- was present in the motorcade, but Homawoo said that he was not even in Togo at the time.Embuscade contre Gilchrist Olympio Republicoftogo.com, 16 April 2010 Parricide Republicoftogo.com, 17 April 2010 Later in the month, Olympio reiterated his support for Fabre's candidacy.Olympio demeure le pr√©sident national de l'UFC Republicoftogo.com, 26 April 2010 Fabre supporters held another protest on 1 May 2010. On that occasion, Fabre called on the people to wear yellow (the party color of the UFC) on 3 May, the date Gnassingb√© was scheduled to be sworn in, as a symbolic gesture of protest. He expressed continued resolve and confidence that he would take power within weeks.Fabre rit jaune Republicoftogo.com, 2 May 2010 Gnassingb√© was sworn in for his second term on 3 May 2010 at a ceremony in the presence of several other African leaders.Togo's Gnassingbe sworn in despite protests Reuters, 3 May 2010¬´ Devant Dieu et devant le peuple togolais ¬ª Republicoftogo.com, 3 May 2010 Prime Minister Gilbert Houngbo, a technocrat first appointed by Gnassingb√© in 2008, resigned on 5 May;Togolese government resigns Republicoftogo.com, 6 May 2010 Gnassingb√© re-appointed him as Prime Minister on 7 May.Houngbo II Republicoftogo.com, 7 May 2010 The reappointment of Houngbo was followed by negotiations between the government and the UFC, with Olympio's approval, regarding UFC participation in the government. This marked a distinct change in attitude for the UFC, as it had previously always taken a hard line against the RPT regime and refused to participate in the government. After a few weeks, Olympio announced on 27 May 2010 that he had signed an agreement with RPT Secretary-General Solitoki Esso that provided for the inclusion of seven UFC ministers in \\"a government of national reconstruction\\", along with various electoral reforms sought by the UFC. The agreed reforms included the redrawing of constituencies (the existing boundaries tended to favor the RPT), a new census, and the revision of the voter rolls. Olympio said that he would chair a committee to monitor matters related to the agreement.Olympio annonce un accord Republicoftogo.com, 27 May 2010 Later on the same day, Houngbo confirmed that an agreement had been reached on the inclusion of seven UFC ministers and electoral reforms.Houngbo confirme l'arriv√©e de ministres UFC Republicoftogo.com, 27 May 2010 Highlighting the continuing differences between the Olympio and Fabre factions of the UFC, Fabre expressed disapproval for Olympio's decision on 27 May, saying that Olympio was acting contrary to the wishes of the UFC National Bureau.Divorce consomm√© entre Fabre et Olympio Republicoftogo.com, 28 May 2010 With the agreement concluded, Gnassingb√© appointed Houngbo's new government on 28 May 2010; it included 31 ministers, seven of whom were members of the UFC. Powerful Gnassingb√© loyalists like Pascal Bodjona remained in the government, while Solitoki Esso was also brought back into the government as Minister of State for the Civil Service and Administrative Reform.31 ministres dans la nouvelle √©quipe Republicoftogo.com, 28 May 2010 Acting under Fabre's direction, the UFC National Bureau immediately met on 28 May and subjected Olympio--the UFC's founder and President--to a \\"temporary expulsion\\" for violating party discipline. The UFC members appointed to the government were also temporarily expelled. UFC First Vice-President Patrick Lawson was present but reportedly did not approve of the decision reached by the National Bureau. Fabre continued to express a hard-line position, declaring that he was robbed of victory through fraud and was the elected President.Olympio exclu du parti qu‚Äôil a fond√© Republicoftogo.com, 28 May 2010 The expulsion of Olympio was apparently not accepted by the whole party, as the UFC website remained under the control of Olympio loyalists. In a statement on 29 May, the website derided Fabre and his supporters; it said that Fabre was not the \\"elected President\\" and that he did not control the UFC. According to the statement, it was impossible to expel the party's founder-president, who had been re-elected to his post as recently as July 2008, without holding an extraordinary congress to approve such a weighty decision. Despite the rift, the statement still acknowledged that Fabre was \\"in his place\\" as Secretary-General of the UFC, while asserting that Olympio remained the UFC's President.Jean-Pierre Fabre n‚Äôest pas le ¬´ pr√©sident √©lu¬ª Republicoftogo.com, 29 May 2010 The agreement struck between the government and Olympio was highly symbolic, given Olympio's long history of radical opposition to Gnassingb√© Eyadema and his son, and it significantly bolstered Faure Gnassingb√©'s claim to be working for political reconciliation, openness, and cooperation. Nevertheless, some observers suggested that the agreement would have little practical effect, arguing that Olympio was largely distant from his party's operations.Emile Kouton, Togo opposition protests leader's move to join govt AFP, 29 May 2010 Two large rallies were held in Lom√© on 29 May 2010. Thousands participated in a rally to express support for Gnassingb√© and his \\"policy of reconciliation\\", while thousands of Fabre supporters rallied to denounce Olympio for compromising with the RPT regime. Describing Olympio as a traitor, the demonstrators vowed to continue their struggle. Fabre said that Olympio would face the UFC's disciplinary council and that he could be permanently expelled from the party.

The Museum holds over 3,500 musical instruments from the 16th century onward and is one of the largest and most representative musical instrument collections in Germany. Objects include a portable harpsichord once owned by Prussia‚Äôs Queen Sophie Charlotte, flutes from the collection of Frederick the Great, and Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs glass harmonica. History The Museum was founded in 1888 at the Royal Academy of Music in Berlin from a collection assembled by Philipp Spitta and Joseph Joachim. Thirty-four instruments from the Museum of Decorative Arts, which had once been heard at the state court of the Kingdom of Prussia, formed the basis of the collection. By 1890 the Museum had purchased hundreds more from Leipzig publisher and music dealer Paul de Wit. The world famous \\"Bach Cembalo\\" is one of these. The largest acquisitions were made by Oskar Fleischer, first Director from 1892-1919, with financial support from Wilhelm II. In 1902 over 1,400 instruments from the private collection Ghent Attorney C√©sar Snoeck were acquired, including four 17th century Ruckers harpsichords as well as one of the few original transverse flutes by Jean Hotteterre. Curt Sachs, Director from 1919-1933, brought a scientific approach to the collections. He was one of the founders of modern organology (the study of musical instruments) and co-authored the Sachs-Hornbostel system of instrument classification. The Museum rose to international importance and his catalogs form the basis of academic research papers to this day.Allen, Warren Dwight (1962), \\"Philosophies of Music History: A Study of General Histories of Music 1600-1960\\", p. vi, Dover 0-486-20282-8 When the Nazis seized power in 1933, Sachs was dismissed from his post by the Nazi Party and forced to emigrate because he was Jewish. In 1935, the musical instrument collection was removed from the Academy to the new National Institute for German Music Research headed by Max Seiffert. The new Museum opened its doors at the Palais von Kreutz at Klosterstra√üe 36 in 1936, and by World War II it owned over 4000 instruments. During the war, the Museum and its collection was almost completely destroyed. In 1943, holdings were evacuated from Berlin to protect them from Allied bombing. Despite extensive security measures, a large portion was lost. In January 1945 \\"by decree of the Reich Minister for Science, Education and Public Education,\\" the Museum was closed. By war's end, the building was a ruin and only 700 instruments of the original collection survived. In the immediate aftermath of the war, what was left of the Museum and Institute was directly administered by the government of West Berlin and in 1949 moved to temporary quarters at Charlottenburg Palace. Despite sparse funding, a painstaking effort was mounted to reconstruct the musical instrument collection. In 1950, on the 200th anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach, the Institute held its first chamber concert on the Museum's historical instruments in the Oak Gallery of the Palace. Alfred Berner, Director until 1975, largely succeeded in rebuilding the Museum and in addition a comprehensive library focusing on organology. Since 1984, the museum has been located in a Wisniewski-designed building at the Kemper Platz, next to the Berlin Philharmonic on the Kulturforum. Today there are over 3,200 instruments in the collection and about 800 exhibits are presented in permanent exhibition. Those instruments that are still playable are played regularly. Today the Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) is part of the State Institute for Music Research, under the auspices of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. Building Interior The Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) and the State Institute for Music Research (SIM) form a unit in Berlin. Their common building was constructed between 1979 and 1984 by Edgar Wisniewski after the designs of architect Hans Scharoun, who had died in 1972. The museum is one of the few places where a theater organ can be heard live: the 1929 Mighty Wurlitzer organ (with 1228 pipes, 175 stops and 43 pistons). It had formerly been in the concert hall of Ferdinand Werner von Siemens's villa, the grandson of the Siemens founder. After the guided tour every Thursday after 6 pm and every Saturday at noon the instrument is played publicly. The museum also has its own concert hall, the Curt-Sachs-Saal, where chamber concerts take place regularly.

When the wetlands are flooded once a year, the grass and other plants will eventually die and start to decay. During this process, decomposing microbes deplete the shallow water of all oxygen, suffocating larger decomposers. Unlike other decomposing animals, the apple snail have both gills and lungs, making it possible for them to thrive in anoxic waters where they recycle the nutrients. To get oxygen they extend a long snorkel to the water surface, and pumps air into their lungs. This ability allows them to consume all the dead plant matter and turning it into nutritious fertilizer available for the plants in the area. The snails themselves are also food for a variety of animals.

It stars Robert Walker, Mimsy Farmer and Rita Hayworth. The film is based upon Maurice Cury's novel Sur la Route de Salina. A French-Italian coproduction, it was shot in English in the Canary Islands. Plot Jonas, a young drifter, is wandering in a deserted area on the road to Salina. He stops to drink some water at a desolate roadside service station when Mara, the owner, identifies him as her son Rocky, who disappeared four years ago. Jonas is overwhelmed by the awkward situation, but tired and hungry, accepts Mara's offer of room and board. Feeling sorry for Mara, he pretends to be her beloved son and soon comfortably assume Rocky's identity. Initially, he believes that Mara is simply delusional, but when Mara's old friend and neighbor Warren arrives for a visit, surprisingly, he also acts as if Jonas were Rocky. When Billie, his alleged sister, comes home, Jonas thinks that the game is over and that he'll finally be unmasked as an impostor. But even the attractive and carefree Billie appears to recognize him as her brother and soon takes him under her wing. They spend the days together, and after skinny dipping in the ocean, an erotic relationship develops between them. Everything seems to be fine and Jonas begins to relax in his new role as Rocky. Mara, Billie and Warren enjoy a dinner party together celebrating Rocky's return. Realizing that Billie is having a passionate affair with her alleged brother, Mara and Warren fear that the harmony that had so recently returned would soon be broken. Uneasy, Jonas becomes increasingly interested in finding out the reasons for the disappearance of the true Rocky. He gets the first clues in his search from Warren who, never outwardly expressing any doubt that he is Rocky, mentions during the conversation the name of Rocky's girlfriend, Linda, who runs a local restaurant. In search of answers, Jonas goes to Salina and finds Linda at the restaurant. He drops a glass at the bar to draw attention to himself, and finds that Linda is the first person who fails to recognize him as Rocky. Back at the house, Jonas steals some old photographs from Billie's bedroom that confirm his suspicions that he does not even resemble the real Rocky. When he confronts Billie with the truth, she tells him that she lied to protect Mara and that she loves Rocky and wanted him back. In an attempt to resolve his mounting confusion, Jonas visits Linda again. She tells him that she was going to elope with Rocky the day he disappeared. The surprise visit of Charlie, an old friend of Jonas, once again threatens to completely destroy the fa√ßade that he is Rocky, but not only do Mara and Billie seem totally undisturbed when Charlie calls Jonas by his real name, but Charlie and his companions have a good time with Mara, Billie and the bewildered Jonas. Instead of accepting his friend's offer of leaving with him, Jonas stays with Billie and Mara. Jonas finally learns the shocking truth about the nature of his \\"sister's\\" behavior. When Rocky wanted to leave the incestuous relationship with his sister, Billie unintentionally killed him with a rock while trying to stop him. The revelation marks a turning point in Jonas' relationship with Billie, and from then on, she avoids him. Rebuked by her, Jonas explodes during an argument with Billie. Shaking her against a wall, he accidentally kills her. He runs away in the middle of a rainstorm in spite of Mara's protestations. Mara begs him to stay and offers to help him hide Billie's body under the station as Billie had done with Rocky, but instead, Jonas goes to Salina and tells the sheriff what has happened. The story is told in flashback. Cast The film is notable for its cast. The lead is played by Robert Walker, son of famous actors Robert Walker and Jennifer Jones. It was the last film of Ed Begley who died in April 1970, and the second-to-last of legendary screen siren Rita Hayworth.sur-la-route-de- salina - All Movie *Mimsy Farmer ‚Äî Billie *Robert Walker ‚Äî Jonas *with Ed Begley ‚Äî Warren *Bruce Pecheur ‚Äî Charlie *Ivano Staccioli ‚Äî Linda's Husband *David Sachs ‚Äî Sheriff *Sophie Hardy ‚Äî Linda *Albane ‚Äî Pat *Jaime *Ellie *Oswaldo D'Allo *El Pollo *Sierra *Dada Gallotti *Marc Porel ‚Äî Rocky *and also starring Rita Hayworth as Mara Soundtrack The score was composed by a varied team that included popular French artist Christophe, the rock group Clinic, and arranger-composer Bernard Gerard.

The now-classic soundtrack album was re-released in 2003 by Sony France on the Dreyfus label, and would receive further widespread acclaim the following year when Christophe's theme \\"Sunny Road to Salina\\" and Clinic's \\"The Chase\\" were used by Quentin Tarantino in his Hollywood blockbuster Kill Bill Vol. 2. The Christophe title got widespread usage in Kill Bill trailers around the world, while \\"The Chase\\" was among the tracks chosen for the Grammy Award-nominated Kill Bill Vol. 2 Original Soundtrack album. Reception In the U.S. Road to Salina had a modest and brief release. Its play-date was usually on the lower half of a double feature.Ringgold, The Films Of Rita Hayworth, p. 242 Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it \\" An admirable ambitious film of strictly sophisticated appeal.\\" He described the film as:\\" A fable showing how tragedy can occur when reality intrudes upon the lonely lives of those who live in a world of fantasy\\". The review in Newsday called Road to Salina \\" A very strange film... More perversely compelling than it has a right to be\\".Ringgold, The Films Of Rita Hayworth, p. 244 In The Village Voice, Robert Colaciello wrote: \\" If your taste runs to 70s actors having 60s sex in a 50s film so that a 40s star can suffer, then Road to Salina is for you \\" References Bibliography *Ringgold, Gene: The Films of Rita Hayworth: The legend and Career of a Love Goddess, The Citadel Press, Seacacus, N.J, 1974, External links Road to Salina at TV Guide (1987 write-up was originally published in The Motion Picture Guide) La Route de Salina: Original Soundtrack album at Discogs.com Category:1970 films Category:1970s thriller films Category:French films Category:Films directed by Georges Lautner Category:Films set in the United States Category:Films shot in the Canary Islands Category:Films produced by Robert Dorfmann Category:English- language French films ","title":"Road to Salina"},{"id":"24414532","text":"Honor of the Range is a 1934 American film directed by Alan James.

It took place at the now abandoned village of Placitas in Confederate Arizona. The action is a part of the Apache Wars of the mid to late nineteenth century. Battle Following the Gallinas Massacre, Lieutenant John Pulliam of the Confederate garrison at Fort Stanton, returned from his patrol in the Gallinas Mountains where he searched for the three dead soldiers, massacred a week earlier. He arrived at Fort Stanton on September 8, 1861. That same evening a dispatch arrived from the Placito, a Spanish era settlement, occupied by Mexican settlers. The dispatch detailed a current Apache assault on the town, ten miles below the fort. Pulliam was ordered to proceed to the village with fifteen men to help protect its citizens. After arriving, at night, Pulliam, his fifteen men and an unknown number of Mexican men, drove the Apaches out of town and then fought off the Apaches all night at a further range. Eventually the natives gave up and retreated back into the surrounding desert. Casualties are unknown, except for the Apaches who suffered at least five men killed by Pulliam's squad. An unknown number of Apache wounded escaped the fighting. The Lieutenant and his men arrived back at Fort Stanton the following afternoon.

He was the founder of Wolf Park in Indiana and a professor of animal behaviour at Purdue University. Education Erich Klinghammer was born in Kassel, Germany, where he received high school education. He emigrated to United States in 1951 and served in the United States Army from 1953 to 1955, earning United States citizenship through military service, and returned to higher education at the University of Chicago with support from the G. I. Bill. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1958 and continued graduate education under animal behaviorist Eckhard Hess, studying imprinting in birds. After discovering he was allergic to birds, he switched the focal species of his research on animal behaviour to grey wolves donated by the Brookfield Zoo and housed in an enclosure on his property near Battle Ground, Indiana. He received his PhD in 1962 but would continue study on the captive wolves, expanding as more animals arrived. Wolf research Erich Klinghammer was appointed assistant professor at the University of Chicago in 1965, lecturing on ethology and animal psychology. In 1968, he transferred to the Department of Psychological Sciences at Purdue University to hold the position of associate professor, continuing his pioneering study on wolf pack dynamics and social behaviour, including early analyses of wolf howls and developing the techniques of socialization for wildlife in captivity. His property developed into a wolf research and education facility eventually named Wolf Park, officially founded in 1972 with him as director. The resident study animal population would expand to include other species of canids such as coyotes and red foxes. At the time, very little was known about wolves as their behaviour was difficult to observe for prolonged periods in the wild. Extended scientific observations of wolves in captivity allowed their complex social behaviours to be characterized, information which would later be corroborated or differences examined by more extensive and advanced field studies.Klinghammer, E. (ed.) 1979. The Behavior and Ecology of Wolves. New York: Garland. Together with other scientific staff at the park, Klinghammer published and maintained the Wolf Ethogram, an encyclopedia of all wolf behaviours and vocalizations recorded. In his theoretical views, Klinghammer followed the approach of Jakob von Uexk√ºll and used his concept of umwelt.Pat Goodmann. The Wolf Park News, 2012, p. 1‚Äì2. In 1993, after teaching for 26 years, Erich Klinghammer retired from his position at Purdue as professor emeritus. He would continue his mission of wolf research and education at Wolf Park until passing on in 2011 at the age of 81. Legacy Through his activities at Wolf Park, Erich Klinghammer taught and inspired many budding biologists and conservationists who would later go on to conduct significant research and conservation work on wolves and other species, including Douglas Smith, leader of the Yellowstone National Park Wolf Project and Roger Pallmer, founder of the UK Wolf Conservation Trust. The Erich Klinghammer Award is given in his memory for outstanding contributions in the fields of wolf behaviour, ecology, and conservation.

Written by Maurice Geraghty based on the 1921 novel The Mysterious Rider by Zane Gray, the film is about a notorious outlaw who returns to the ranch he once owned and takes a job disguised as a ranch hand. Unrecognized by the ranch's current owner, he waits patiently for an opportunity to expose the men who murdered his partner twenty years ago, framed him for the crime, and then stole his ranch. The film was later released for television in the United States as Mark of the Avenger. Plot In the Arizona desert in the late 1800s, famed outlaw Pecos Bill (Douglass Dumbrille) and his sidekick Frosty Kilburn (Sidney Toler) hold up a stagecoach. During the raid, Bill takes money from a wealthy passenger and gives it to a poor woman passenger, then rides away. Having lived an outlaw life for the past twenty years, and still wanted for a murder he did not commit, Pecos Bill, whose real name is Ben Wade, decides to return to his home town disguised as a regular cowboy to see his now grown daughter. Meanwhile, Jack Bellounds (Weldon Heyburn), the son of the corrupt rancher William Bellounds (Stanley Andrews) who stole Ben's White Slider ranch, returns from prison and is given a ride back to the ranch by Ben's beautiful daughter Collie Wade (Charlotte Field), who was raised by his father. When Collie refuses his offer of marriage, the arrogant Jack races their horse-drawn carriage wildly through the desert. Seeing the runaway carriage, the gallant ranch forman Wils Moore (Russell Hayden) chases them down and stops the horses. As Wils rides off, Jack notices that Collie is attracted to Wils. When Ben and Frosty arrive at White Slider ranch, they get hired on as saddle makers, with Ben going by the name of Red Johnson. No one recognizes him‚Äînot even his daughter who hasn't seen him since her childhood. After settling in, Ben learns that 200 head of cattle have been stolen, and that Bellounds seems uninterested in finding the thieves. With the help of Frosty and Wils‚Äîone of the few honest men at the ranch‚ÄîBen intends to put a stop to the cattle rustling and restore the ranch to his daughter, the rightful owner. Meanwhile, Jack meets with Cap Folsom (Monte Blue), the leader of the cattle rustlers and Jack's former boss. Cap is also the man who murdered Ben's partner and framed him for the crime. Jack complains about the timing of the recent raid, but Folsom dismisses him, saying he can never turn his back on his outlaw past. At the ranch, Ben is tasked with working with the dogs on the ranch, and soon he uses his position to guard the cattle. One afternoon, Ben meets his daughter on the range and they talk about her future. Concerned that she may end up with a lout like Jack, he tells her that she will need to decide between Jack and Wils. Soon after, Ben is alerted by his barking dogs to rustlers in the area, and dressed in black as Pecos Bill, he rides after them. The rustlers recognize the approaching outlaw and take cover. During the ensuing gunfight, Wils arrives with his trustworthy men, sees Pecos Bill, and chases after him instead of the rustlers. Back at the ranch, Wils attempts to capture Ben, but is thwarted by a well-placed knife throw by Frosty. Knowing that Wils is on the right side of the law, Ben reveals his true identity and the truth behind how he lost his ranch‚Äîthat he left his foreman William Bellounds to look after things, but he stole the ranch for himself, and now is rustling his own cattle for profit. Convinced he is on the level, Wils pledges to help Ben. When the other ranchers get together to search for the rustlers, Ben dresses up in black like Pecos Bill, draws their attention, and leads them to the rustlers' hideout. The plan backfires when the ranchers discover that Wils helped Pecos Bill to escape. Just as the mob prepares to lynch Wils, Pecos Bill rides in to the rescue. When Bellounds figures out that Pecos Bill is in fact Ben Wade, his former boss, he reveals his discovery to the leader of the rustlers, Cap Folsom. Soon, Bellounds is gunned down in cold blood. Jack goes after Cap to avenge his father's death, and is himself soon killed. Ben, Wils, and Frosty go after Cap and they meet in a fierce gunfight. During the battle, Ben tracks down Cap in the rustlers hideout, gives him a chance to draw, and then shoots him dead. Sometime later, Ben and Frosty say their goodbyes to Collie and Wils and ride away into the Arizona desert.

Alcoholic beverages Historically, Sudan was one of the few predominantly Muslim countries that allowed alcohol. Men drank millet wine, sharbot (an alcoholic drink from fermented dates) and araqi. As the 20th century came, they were influenced by Europeans, and began drinking whiskey and beer. Since the late 1980s when Sudan sharia was implemented, alcohol has been banned. The law bans the purveying, consumption, and purchasing of alcohol. Being lashed 40 times is the penalty for breaking the prohibition on alcohol. Former Sudanese President Gaafar Nimeiry enacted sharia in September 1983, marking the occasion by dumping alcohol into the Nile river. Araqi is an alcoholic gin made from dates, which is illegally brewed in defiance of sharia. Araqi brewers in Sudan continue production despite sharia.

Veteran Campaigners ‚Äì A History of the Punjab Regiment 1759-1981. Lahore: Wajidalis. Early history The regiment was raised in 1857, during the upheaval of the Indian Mutiny, as the 9th Regiment of Punjab Infantry from the men of the 3rd and 6th Punjab Infantry. The regiment took part in the Abyssinian Campaign of 1867-68 and the Second Afghan War of 1878-80. In June 1902 they were posted to the garrison in Tien Tsin, in China. Uniform The officer's service dress consisted of a jacket with turned collar and shoulder straps. Over knickerbockers hung a long khaki shirt, and other Indian ranks wore a kurta. They wore regimental buttons, shoulder straps, badges and stripes. The infantry in the Indian army pre-1914 wore a bandolier, and a brown leather belt reminiscent of the British Army pre-1908 webbing issue. They carried a Lee Enfield rifle and short bayonet. As part of the Punjab Frontier Force the drab army full-dress was with scarlet facings. The officers also wore but with hussar tunics, cording, pouch-belts, a silver whistle, chain, and badge with regulation white topes. The soldiers wound up puggarees as standard dress. The regiment recruited both Hindus and Moslems which was said to work well under British officers. Half a company would include Dogras, Sikhs, Punjabi Mussulmans, and Pathans, the latter half consisting of Yusufzais, Orukzais, and Afridis. There were eight companies post-1857, including a total of four platoons. The Pathans on the Afghani border were occasionally unruly, and sought to escape service to serve enemies. While Afridis were solicited for recruitment in Great War by the German-sponsored rebels seeking to overthrow the government.Barnes, Military Uniforms of Great Britain & The Empire (London, 1960), pp.254-6 21st Punjabis 330px Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 21st Punjabis. During the First World War, the regiment served in Egypt and Palestine. In 1918, it took part in the Battle of Megiddo, which led to the annihilation of Turkish Army in Palestine. In 1917, the 21st Punjabis raised a second battalion, which was disbanded after the war. Subsequent History After the First World War, the 21st Punjabis were grouped with the 19th, 20th, 22nd and 24th Punjabis, and the 40th Pathans to form the 14th Punjab Regiment in 1922.

The Johns Hopkins University owns the station, a community radio station with student volunteers, who are mainly on-air deejays and other program hosts. Programming blocks are divided into formats, dealing mostly with music, sports and cultural life: classical, dance, folk, jazz, public affairs, sports, rap, and rock formats -- along with a few specialty shows outside any of the formats. Its studios are located on the Homewood campus. History Early years WJHU had its antecedents in the mid-1940s with an informal broadcast from Levering Hall on the Homewood campus. In the early 1950s the campus radio station moved into the basement of the Alumni Memorial Residences II (AMR II), where it would stay for the next thirty years. WJHU transmitted on the 830 AM frequency in the dormitories via carrier current (a low-wattage transmission using the wiring in buildings). By the mid-1970s, the station operated with students running 3-hour shows on a 24/7 programming schedule. The station also carried away Johns Hopkins lacrosse games with student announcers. A long-time goal of the station was to transition to being an actual broadcast station on FM (which was the ostensible reason for requiring all staff to obtain a U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 3rd class operator's license). Technical issues in 1975 led to suspension of broadcasting for much of the academic year and to questions among the staff concerning management. This in turn led in early 1976 to changes in management, programming, and use of facilities, as well as to increased attention from the university administration. FM transition In 1977, the student managers of the station and the university administration agreed to push for an FCC license to broadcast on 88.1 FM.It was previously known that 88.1 was the only available frequency in the part of the FM spectrum reserved for non-commercial stations, but this had to be verified first by an engineering survey. Official and budgetary support from the university administration made this possible, and final approval for a 10-watt station on 88.1 FM came from the FCC in 1978.\\"On the Air Again: Radio station WJHU is reborn as a student-run Internet radio offering,\\" by Greg Rienzi, The Gazette, Vol. 32, No. 33, 5 May 2003 WJHU-FM began broadcasting in 1979, featuring a mixed format with jazz in the early morning, classical during the day, specialty programming in the early evening during weekdays and Saturday/Sunday morning including 60's oldies (with radio announcer Michael Yockel), acoustic/folk music (No Strings Attached with radio announcer Gary Kenneth Bass), art-rock (with radio announcer Janet Sanford), bluegrass (with radio announcer Carol Burris) and Irish music (with radio announcer Myron Bretholz) ; rock till midnight (predominantly new wave), and its signature NAR (\\"Not Available Radio\\") progressive programming at night, along with short news programming. The signal extended off campus and the students hired for the first time a non-student to oversee the station full- time and ensure compliance with FCC rules and university expectations. The station operated twenty-four hours a day. Faced with FCC deregulation of low- wattage FM stations in the early 1980s, and in order to protect the frequency, the student managers decided to apply for a 25,000 watt license, which would extend the audience throughout the Baltimore and Washington DC area. This became the largest radio station power increase on record. The application was approved in 1982, however the station went off the air in 1983-4 due to renovation of AMR II in which the studios were located.\\"Letters to the Editor: WJHU 'history' leaves out broken promises,\\" by Mark G. Margolin, The Johns Hopkins News-Letter, 12 February 2004 The station returned to the air in February 1985. Transition to professional operations In the summer of 1985, the university hired a full-professional staff to run WJHU. Broadcasting classical music and talk, it quickly out-paced its classical competition (WBJC) and scored solid audience numbers. Over the years it progressively added more content from National Public Radio and its partners, shifting to the format of news/talk in the daytime and overnight weekday hours, and music (mainly jazz) programming during evenings and nights. WJHU-FM apparently encountered financial difficulties, and before some fundraising success in the early 1990s, the university considered selling it.\\"WJHU emerges from financial woes,\\" by Steve McKerrow, Baltimore Sun, 5 March 1991 WJHU became the area National Public Radio affiliate, and in the fall of 1998, it added overnight coverage of World Radio Network (WRN). Sale to Your Public Radio Corp. The university decided to sell the station, due to the expense of maintaining it, and the fact that it did not fit with the Johns Hopkins' mission.\\"Steiner group moves closer to owning WJHU,\\" by David Folkenflik, Baltimore Sun, 14 July 2001 The station and frequency were sold by the university in early 2002 to Your Public Radio Corp., a locally based group of station talk hosts and listeners, and became WYPR.\\"WJHU turned over to WYPR,\\" by S. Brendan Short, The Johns Hopkins News-Letter, 7 February 2002\\"Station to become WYPR,\\" Baltimore Sun, 31 January 2002 Revival of student radio on carrier- current In the early 1990s, students founded the alternative on-campus carrier current AM radio station called WHAT radio and later renamed WHSR (standing for Hopkins Student Radio). Like the earlier WJHU-AM, this station transmitted within the dorms, but it also added Levering Hall and the Charles apartments. This effort ended in 2000. WJHU internet radio During the summer of 2002, a group of Hopkins students began a new radio effort, and with the assistance of the Dean of Student Life, established a new internet radio station under the name WJHU. It began broadcasting on 22 April 2003.\\"Turning the radio back on ‚Äì Editorial,\\" The Johns Hopkins News-Letter, 1 May 2003\\"With new rockin‚Äô lineup, WJHU battles for listeners,\\" by Megan Waitkoff, The Johns Hopkins News-Letter, 5 February 2004 References JHU WJHU JHU Category:Radio stations established in 1945 Category:1945 establishments in Maryland Category:Internet radio stations in the United States Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States ","title":"WJHU"},{"id":"24414863","text":"Chak Budho is a village with approximately 3,000 inhabitants in Malka Union Council, Kharian Tehsil, Gujrat District, Punjab, Pakistan.

Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteers occupying a farmhouse in Clonmult, County Cork were surrounded by a force of British Army, Royal Irish Constabulary and Auxiliaries. In the action that followed, twelve IRA volunteers were killed, four wounded and four captured. A total of 22 people died in the ambush and subsequent executions ‚Äì 14 IRA members, 2 Black and Tans and 6 suspected informers. Background The 4th battalion of the IRA First Cork Brigade, under Diarmuid O'Hurley and based around Midleton, Youghal and Cobh, had been a successful unit up until the Clonmult ambush. They had captured three RIC barracks and carried out an ambush in Midleton itself.Peter Hart, The IRA and its Enemies, p. 97 In January 1921, the unit took possession of a disused farmhouse overlooking the village of Clonmult. O'Hurley planned to ambush a military train at Cobh Junction on Tuesday 22 February 1921 and at the time of the Clonmult action was scouting a suitable ambush site. However, according to historian Peter Hart, they \\"had become over-confident and fallen into a traceable routine\\".Hart, p. 97 An intelligence officer of the British Army Hampshire Regiment traced them to their billet at a farmhouse in Clonmult The battle British troops (a party of the 2nd Battalion, Hampshire Regiment under the command of Lieutenant A. R. Koe) surrounded the house. Two IRA volunteers noticed the advancing troops and opened fire. Both were killed, but the shooting had warned those sheltering inside the house, and a siege began. A sortie from the house was attempted in the hope of gaining reinforcements from the local IRA company.Clonmult Ambush details, omepage.eircom.net; accessed 20 August 2014. The acting IRA commander, Captain Jack O'Connell, managed to get away but three other volunteers were killed in the attempt. But O'Connell was unable to bring help in time. The Volunteers trapped inside made a desperate but unsuccessful attempt to escape through a narrow opening in the gable. Their hopes were dashed when British reinforcements arrived instead‚Äîregular RIC police, Black and Tans and Auxiliaries. The police had also brought petrol, which an Army officer used to set the thatched roof of the farmhouse alight. With the farmhouse burning around them, an attempt was then made by the IRA to surrender. 'Kilmichael in reverse'? What happened next is disputed. In his after-action report, Lieutenant Koe wrote: > (14) At 18.20 hours the rebels signified that they wished to surrender and > they were ordered to put up their hands and come out one by one. At 18.30 > hours, six or seven rebels came out with their hands up and the crown forces > went to meet them. On this fire was again opened by the remaining rebels in > the house. > (15) Fire was at once re-opened on the house by the Crown Forces, and, in > the cross fire which resulted, it was inevitable that casualties should be > inflicted on the rebels outside the house by both sides. The Crown Forces, > having re-opened fire, rushed to the house. When the house was captured, > there were eight men in it, four wounded and four unwounded. These were > taken prisoner.Quoted in Tom O'Neill, The Battle of Clonmult: The IRA's > Worst Defeat (Dublin: Nonsuch, 2006), p. 97 In its official communique, General Headquarters merely stated that some of the IRA Volunteers \\"came running out of the house, with their hands up, while others continued to fire on the Crown Forces as they went to accept the surrender.\\" But in his monthly confidential report, the local county inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary accused the Volunteers of treachery, saying that some \\"had tried to escape by a ruse. Some came from the building while those that remained inside opened fire on the police and military.\\"Quoted in O'Neill, pp. 92‚Äì3 By contrast, the surviving Volunteers claimed that their men had surrendered in good faith, and had come out with their hands up, only to be shot by the police without any provocation. Patrick Higgins, an IRA man who survived the killings, recalled: > We were lined up alongside an outhouse with our hands up. The Tans came > along and shot every man with the exception of three...who were saved by the > officer in charge of the military party. A Tan put his revolver to my mouth > and fired [he was wounded in the jaw]...Only for the military officer coming > along, I would be gone.Annie Ryan, Comrades, Inside the War of Independence, > Liberties, 2007; , p. 87 Opinion is divided amongst historians as to which version of the story to believe: Peter Hart, for example, wrote that, \\"The Irish survivors testified convincingly that there had been no treachery on their part.\\" However, he also compared what happened at Clonmult to what happened at the Kilmichael ambush on 28 November 1920, suggesting that Clonmult could be described as \\"Kilmichael in reverse\\", the IRA members intending to surrender but the security forces not realising it.Hart, pp. 97-98 In his book The Battle of Clonmult: The IRA's Worst Defeat, Tom O'Neill suggests the shooting of IRA members may have been the result of a misunderstanding. Before the Volunteers gave up and came out, their commander had ordered them to throw their rifles into the fire: and what the police mistook for treachery may have been ammunition cooking off in the heat of the flames. \\"The other possibility,\\" as O'Neill notes, \\"is that the British were just attempting to cover up their tracks with falsehoods.\\"O'Neill, p. 39 A total of twelve IRA Volunteers were killed in the action, with four more wounded and only four taken prisoner unscathed.Hart 98 Two of the IRA prisoners (Maurice Moore and Paddy O'Sullivan) were later executed in the Cork military barracks on 28 April. Patrick Higgins was sentenced to death but was reprieved due to the truce that ended the war on 11 July.Ryan, p. 87 Hampshire Regiment historian Scott Daniell noted on the action that \\"like all the Irish operations, it was hateful to the British troops\\".David Scott Daniell, The Royal Hampshire Regiment 1918-1954, p. 11 The Aftermath The IRA suspected that an informer had led the British to the billet of the column wiped out at Clonmult, and over the following week, six alleged spies were executed by the IRA in the surrounding area.Hart, p. 98 Mick Leahy, a local IRA officer, stated that \\"things went to hell in the battallion\\" after Clonmult.Michael Hopkinson, The Irish War of Independence, p. 111 Diarmuid O'Hurley, the commander of the battalion, was not at Clonmult but was later killed on 28 May 1921.

Shenge is the seat of the Kagboro Chiefdom, part of the third level of administration. The dense coastal jungle has prevented development of a good road network, and the Shenge is still most easily reached by boat. The local small fishing and passenger boats that travel among the coastal towns are known as pampas in Sierra Leone. The population of Shenge is ethnically very diverse, with no single ethnic group forming a majority. They work predominantly as fishermen, and the town is one of the biggest fish producers in the country. History This area was long dominated by the native Sherbro people. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, there were marriages between English traders of the Royal African Company and Sherbro women. Their descendants became merchants and traders, coming to dominate the slave trade and political power. The Corker/Caulker family dominated the Bumpe Chiefdom in the Moyamba District into the late 20th century. There were Christian Methodist missionaries in this area from the early nineteenth century. In 1855 Shenge was chosen as the site for a mission station by the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. This was founded by Daniel Kumler Flickinger, and subsequently developed by Joseph Gomer. 21st century On September 9, 2009 a coastal boat or pampa was travelling a sea route of about along the coast from Shenge to the Western Area town of Tombo near Freetown with at least 246 passengers on board, including many schoolchildren returning from holidays. It capsized shortly after departure. The Sierra Leone Navy commander Mao Suma, who was in charge of the rescue operation, said sixteen bodies were recovered and 39 passengers rescued. Commander Suma said 213 passengers were still missing and feared dead. The government promised to investigate the accident. The Sierra Leone Police said that overloading and bad weather might have been an issue. This was the second major pampa accident in Sierra Leone in less than a decade. In November 2000 at least 150 people drowned when a boat capsized carrying 200 people; it was also traveling between Shenge and Tombo. President Ernest Bai Koroma declared Monday 14 September 2009 as a day of national mourning for the victims of the boat accident. He and top members of his government traveled to Shenge to meet with local officials and survivors. Represented in popular culture In the film Blood Diamond (2006), Shenge is said to be the home of the protagonist Solomon Vandy (played by Djimon Hounsou), a diamond worker, and his family. Set in the 1990s, the film explores the attack on Shenge by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), who capture Vandy.

In many cases black Americans have been able to pursue professional football opportunities in the CFL that were for one reason or another unavailable in the United States. Especially in the mid-20th century, many African American players came to Canada to avoid the racially charged atmosphere of segregation-era America. For many years, blacks were better represented in the CFL than they were in the National Football League (NFL), and achieved a number of \\"firsts\\" in the CFL years before the same was accomplished in the NFL. More recently, the CFL has provided opportunities for black, as well as other, Americans unable to break into the NFL. Background There were a small number of black players in the league now known as the National Football League from its inception in 1920. Following the 1933 season, however, there were no black players in the NFL or any other major-league level professional football association, including the precursors to the Canadian Football League, until 1946. During this period, black players were confined to minor leagues and independent barnstorming teams. At this time, however, college football was much more popular than any professional league.Longley, p. 5. This was also the time period in which Canadian football began to \\"professionalize\\". Having evolved out of rugby with the adoption of the forward pass in the 1920s, Canadian football grew in popularity in the subsequent years until teams made up of professional players began to dominate and displace amateur teams. Professionalization meant that teams were able to attract talent from a significantly wider pool. This benefited teams in smaller, primarily western Canadian cities that had a smaller pool from which to draw and were thus at a disadvantage compared to the larger eastern metropolises. Beginning in 1935 Canadian teams began to recruit American players, a trend that continues today. At this time, the CFL was a legitimate competitor to the NFL, paying comparable wages and attracting a similar level of talent. However, there were no African Americans on any Canadian football team until 1946.Longley, p. 6. In 1946, professional football took its first steps towards integration. The NFL signed two black players, Woody Strode and Kenny Washington, both of whom played for the Los Angeles Rams. However, the NFL's integration process was gradual: while individual teams signed individual black players, there was no active drafting of blacks until 1949, and some teams resisted integration for several more years (most famously owner George Preston Marshall refused to sign blacks to his Washington Redskins team as late as 1962, at which point he was forced to do so by the U.S. government). The CFL's colour barrier was broken in 1946, when Montreal Alouettes general manager Lew Hayman signed Herb Trawick. From that point on, a steady flow of African Americans began to migrate to the CFL, which, at the time, was a legitimate competitor league to the NFL. CFL firsts Players In 1946, Montreal Alouettes GM Lew Hayman brought in Herb Trawick, making Trawick the first black player in the CFL. Hayman, a New York City-born Jew, saw the way that Montrealers had embraced Jackie Robinson with the Montreal Royals and believed the city was ready to accept a black football player. In 1964, Tom Casey became the first black player inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, three years before New York Giant Emlen Tunnell became the first black player in the NFL's Pro Football Hall of Fame. Trawick may not have been the first black player in the CFL. There is photographic evidence that Robert \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson was the first African- American player, with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, in 1930. He was a porter with the railways and is in a team picture from that year.Rider Pride: The Story of Canada's Best-Loved Football Team by Bob Andrews and Garry Calder (Western Producer Prairie Books: 1984) Otherwise Gabe Patterson was the first black player to play for the Green Riders. In 1948 Ken Whitlock became the Toronto Argonauts' first black player. Coaches As Toronto Argonauts president in 1980, Heyman hired Willie Wood as the first black head coach in the CFL. It was nine more years until Art Shell became the first black coach in the National Football League, with the 1989 Oakland Raiders. (NOTE: Fritz Pollard served as head coach in the NFL prior to segregation.) Michael Clemons served as the first black head coach in the Grey Cup, coaching the Argonauts their Grey Cup victory 2004, two years prior to Tony Dungy coaching the Indianapolis Colts to victory in the Super Bowl XLI (Incidentally, Lovie Smith, the coach of the Chicago Bears, who also appeared in that Super Bowl game, made him and Dungy the first two African-American coaches to appear in the Super Bowl). General managers General manager of the Saskatchewan Roughriders from December 24, 1999 until August 21, 2006, Roy Shivers was the first black general manager in professional football. General manager of the Edmonton Eskimos from December 10, 2012 until April 7, 2017, Ed Hervey was the first black general manager to win the Grey Cup in the Canadian Football League. League commissioner On March 17, 2015, the CFL named U.S.-born Jeffrey Orridge as its commissioner. He is the first African-American commissioner in the CFL's history and at the time of his appointment the first (and only) non-white head of a major North American sports league. Due to philosophical differences between Orridge and the Board of Governors of the CFL, Orridge announced he would step down as commissioner effective June 30, 2017. His last day as commissioner was June 15. Black quarterbacks African American quarterbacks were commonplace in the CFL in the 1970s, two decades before they would become prominent in the NFL. Undrafted in the NFL, Warren Moon won five Grey Cups in six seasons before excelling in the NFL, helping to erase the prejudice that black quarterbacks could not succeed in professional football. By the time Doug Williams of the Washington Redskins became the first black quarterback in the history of the Super Bowl in 1988, the CFL had already seen such players as Moon, Damon Allen, Roy Dewalt, Danny Barrett, J.C. Watts, Condredge Holloway and Chuck Ealey in Grey Cup games. Johnny Bright Drake University star Johnny Bright ‚Äì the victim of a racist assault in what is now known as the Johnny Bright Incident ‚Äì turned down an offer to play for Philadelphia Eagles, who chose him fifth overall in the 1952 National Football League draft. Bright elected to sign with the Calgary Stampeders instead, later commenting: In 1959, following his third straight season as the CFL's rushing leader, Bright won the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award, the first black CFL player to be so honoured. Benefits to league The CFL gained advantages through the recruitment of black players. African American players in the CFL outperformed their white counterparts in a number of areas. CFL teams that employed the highest percentage of African Americans were those teams that had the most on-field success. Racism in the CFL All of which is not say that there were no problems with racism in the CFL. There was, according to legendary player Cookie Gilchrist, who is the only player to have refused induction into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, citing racism and exploitation by team management. Whether Gilchrist's perspective was accurate is unclear; Gilchrist had developed paranoia due to chronic head trauma in his later years.

In 1917, the 22nd Punjabis raised a 2nd battalion, which was disbanded after the war. In 1919, the regiment fought in the Third Afghan War. Subsequent history In 1921-22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 14th Punjab Regiment, formed by grouping the 22nd Punjabis with the 19th, 20th, 21st and 24th Punjabis, and the 40th Pathans. The battalion's new designation was 3rd Battalion 14th Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, the battalion fought in Eritrea, North Africa and Burma.Haig, Brodie.

The film stars Lloyd E. Hughes, Rosalind Keith and William Janney. Plot In World War I, Captain Jerry Broun (Lloyd Hughes) feels he has to fight even though the United States has not yet entered the conflict. He enrols in Canada to fly as a pilot, with his adoring young half- brother Mickey (Delmar Watson) wanting to follow in his footsteps by becoming a pilot. Twenty years later, an older Michael (William Janney) attempts to enter the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC), but cannot overcome his boyhood fear of thunderstorms and is \\"washed out\\". His friend Cecil Dunbar (Glen Boles) persuades a dejected Michael to come to a party hosted by crippled war veteran Raoul McGuire (Jason Robards Sr.). Michael meets McGuire's sister, Molly (Rosalind Keith), who confides that her brother is engaged in criminal activities. Michael's older brother, now in the U.S. Department of Justice and assuming the name \\"Jim Lofton\\", has protected his identity from his family and others, by circulating the cover story that he was killed in the war. Lofton's assignment is to arrest Raoul McGuire, his old flying buddy and the man who once saved his life. McGuire is smuggling oil across the Texas border and is fooled into believing Lofton is part of his gang. Michael falls in love with Raoul's sister, Molly, but at the family ranch, overhears the gang's plans to smuggle oil. Jim Lofton's role is to fly and divert authorities when a military exercise is taking place at the ranch. When Moran (Richard Cramer) the gang leader, shoots and wounds Raoul, in a struggle with Lofton, the gang leader is killed. When the gang involves both Molly and Michael, Lofton reveals his true identity to his brother. Michael overcomes his fears and flies Molly and her wounded brother to a hospital. Jerry Broun takes off in another aircraft to escort Michael, and after a furious gun battle in the air, crashes into the pursuing gangster's aircraft. He then parachutes to safety from his burning aircraft. With his brother recovering from his burns, Michael is reinstated in the USAAC and marries Molly. Cast Production Clipped Wings featured massed aerial scenes with latest USAAC aircraft. Clipped Wings featured a number of aerial scenes, with a mix of staged back screen projection work at the Los Angeles International Film Studios and stock footage from operational fighter squadrons. The use of Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas, where training was taking place, allowed the production company to film a graduation ceremony as well as aircraft such as Boeing P-12 fighters in the air. A 1930 Waco INF (NC864V) and a 1931 Model 7 Fleet (NC798V) were used in the film by the hero and pursuing gangsters. The Fleet Model 7 still exists.Silvers, Bud. \\"The Fleet Repairs\\" usaviator.net, March 18, 2011. Famed aerial photographer Elmer Dyer filmed the aerial action.Wynne 1987, p. 25.

The relationship between Paul the Apostle and Women is an important element in the theological debate about Christianity and women because Paul was the first writer to give ecclesiastical directives about the role of women in the Church. However, there are arguments that some of these writings are post-Pauline interpolations.Odell-Scott, D.W. \\"Editorial dilemma: the interpolation of 1 Cor 14:34‚Äì35 in the western manuscripts of D, G and 88.\\" Web: 23 Mar 2018.  Female disciples  The Gospels record that women were among Jesus' earliest followers. Jewish women disciples, including Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Susanna, had accompanied Jesus during his ministry and supported him out of their private means. Although the details of these gospel stories may be questioned, in general they reflect the prominent historical roles women played in Jesus' ministry as disciples. There were women disciples at the foot of the cross. Women were reported to be the first witnesses to the resurrection, chief among them again Mary Magdalene. She was not only \\"witness\\", but also called a \\"messenger\\" of the risen Christ. From the beginning of the Early Christian church, women were important members of the movement. As time went on, groups of Christians organized within the homes of believers. Those who could offer their home for meetings were considered important within the movement and assumed leadership roles.Margaret MacDonald, \\"Reading Real Women Through Undisputed Letters of Paul\\" in Women and Christian Origins, ed. by Ross Sheppard Kraemer and Mary Rose D'Angelo (Oxford: University Press, 1999), p. 204 Such a woman was Lydia of Philippi, a wealthy dealer in purple cloth. After hearing Paul preach, she and her household were baptized. The earliest Christian movement, most notably Paul‚Äôs movement, was very attractive for wealthy women and widows. They often opened their houses for worship by particular religious movements. According to Elizabeth Sch√ºssler Fiorenza, in the 1st century a woman's place was in the home and the otherwise private areas of life. Turning the private domestic setting into the public religious setting opened up opportunities for religious leadership. Pauline Christianity did not honour its rich patron; instead, it worked within a \\"motif of reciprocity\\" by offering leadership roles, dignity and status in return for patronage. Through building up their own house church, women could experience relative authority, social status and political power and renewed dignity within Paul's movement. This concept is reflected in Paul's relationship with Phoebe, Chloe and Rufus's mother.  Epistolary evidence  By the time Paul began his missionary movement, women were important agents within the different cities. Letters generally accepted as Paul‚Äôs are Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians and Philemon. His casual greetings to acquaintances offer solid information about many Jewish and Gentile women who were prominent in the movement. His letters provide vivid clues about the kind of activities in which women engaged more generally.Frontline: from jesus to christ - the first christians: paul's mission and letters. PBS. Retrieved on 2011-02-13. In the Letter to the Romans, Paul sends greetings to a number of people and specifically mentions: * Priscilla and her husband Aquila. She and her husband are mentioned six times in the Bible, as missionary partners with the Apostle Paul. They were also partners in the craft of tentmaking. The author of Acts states that they were refugees who came first to Corinth when the Emperor Claudius expelled all Jews from Rome. Paul mentions that at some point they had risked their necks for him. When Paul refers to Priscilla and Aquila, Priscilla is listed first two out of three times. Some scholars have suggested that she was the head of the family unit. * Mary and \\"the beloved Persis\\" are commended for their hard work. * He greets Julia, and Nereus' sister, who worked and traveled as missionaries in pairs with their husbands or brothers. He also sends greetings to Tryphena, Tryphosa, who \\"labour for the Lord's work\\", and to Rufus' mother. Barbara Leonhard notes that \\"the fact that Paul singles them out indicates his respect for their ministry.\\" * He commends to their hospitality, Phoebe, a leader from the church at Cenchreae, a port city near Corinth. Paul attaches to her three titles: diakonos meaning a deacon (lit. \\"servant\\"), sister, and prostatis meaning \\"a woman in a supportive role, patron, benefactor\\".‚ÄòœÄœÅŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÑŒπœÇ, ŒπŒ¥ŒøœÇ, ·º° (œÄœÅŒøŒêœÉœÑŒ∑ŒºŒπ, cp. œÄœÅŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ; Cornutus 20 p. 37, 20; Lucian, Bis Accus. 29 Œ∏Œµ·Ω∞ œÄœÅŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÑŒπœÇ ·ºëŒ±œÖœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ; Cass.

There is no difference when the title of deacon is used for Phoebe and Timothy. Diakonos (Gk.) is grammatically a masculine word, the same word that Paul uses in regards to his own ministry. Phoebe is the only woman to be named \\"deacon\\".T. Hammer, ‚ÄòWealthy Widows and Female Apostles: The Economic and Social Status of Women in Early Roman Christianity,‚Äô in G.D. Dunn, D.

Cross (ed.), Prayer and Spirituality in the Early Church: Poverty and Riches, 5 (Strathfield: Paulist Press, 2009), 65‚Äì74. discusses the criteria for deacons in the early Church which is explicitly directed to both males and females. Phoebe was especially influential in the early Church, seen in Jerusalem from the 4th century inscription: \\"Here lies the slave and bride of Christ, Sophia, deacon, the second Phoebe, who fell asleep in Christ.\\"R. Saunders, Outrageous Women, Outrageous God: Women in the First Two Generations of Christianity (Alexandria: E.J. Dwyer, 1996), 117 Women flourished in the diaconate between the 2nd and 6th centuries. The position required pastoral care to women, instructing female candidates and anoint them at baptism. They were also required to be present whenever a female would address a bishop.J. Wijngaards. No Women in Holy Orders? The Women Deacons of the Early Church. (Norwich: Canterbury, 2002) In Romans, Phoebe is seen as acting as Paul's envoy. Phoebe is named as a Patron of Paul, meaning that she would have been financially contributing to Paul's mission. * Junia is also mentioned. According to Bart Ehrman, Paul praises Junia as a prominent apostle who had been imprisoned for her labour. Junia is \\"the only female apostle named in the New Testament\\". Ian Elmer states that Junia and Andronicus are the only \\"apostles\\" associated with Rome that were greeted by Paul in his letter to the Romans.Elmer, Ian. \\"Was Roman Christianity founded by a woman?\\" Catholica. Web: 9 Dec 2009. Steven Finlan says Paul greets this couple as \\"kinspersons and fellow prisoners\\" and says that \\"they are outstanding amongst the apostles\\".Finlan, Steven. The Apostle Paul and the Pauline Tradition. Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2008. pp. xiv + 229. According to Ian Elmer, the fact that Andronicus and Junia are named as apostles suggests a priori that they were evangelists and church-planters like Paul. Some translators have rendered the name as the masculine \\"Junias\\", but Chrysostom seems clear: \\"Indeed, how great the wisdom of this woman must have been that she was even deemed worthy of the title apostle.\\". Scholars dispute whether the grammar indicates that Junia was an apostle herself, or simply well known to the apostles (not being one herself).Junia (New Testament person) * Chloe was a prominent woman of Corinth. It was from \\"Chloe's people\\" that Paul, then at Ephesus learned of the divisions in the congregation of Corinth. * In Philippians he expresses appreciation for Euodia and Syntyche his fellow- workers in the gospel.Laput CM, Thaddeus Noel G., \\"Women and St. Paul\\", Catholic San Francisco, March 6, 2009 According to Karen King, these biblical reports seem to provide credible evidence of women apostles active in the earliest work of spreading the Christian gospel.King, Karen L. \\"Women in Ancient Christianity: The New Discoveries.\\" In Galatians 3:28, Paul wrote \\"nor is there male and female,\\" hearkening back to Genesis 1, for all are one in Christ.  Deaconesses  According to Thurston, there can be no doubt that in their first institution the deaconesses were intended to discharge those same charitable offices, connected with the temporal well being of their poorer fellow Christians, which were performed for the men by the deacons. But in one particular, the instruction and baptism of catechumens, their duties involved service of a more spiritual kind. The universal prevalence of baptism by immersion and the anointing of the whole body which preceded it rendered it a matter of propriety that in this ceremony the functions of the deacons should be discharged by women.Thurston, Herbert. \\"Deaconesses.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 11 Aug. 2014  Ecclesiastical directives  Silence in church The letters of Paul, dated to the middle of the first century AD, were written to specific communities in response to particular questions or problems. Paul was in Ephesus around the year 56 when he received disquieting news regarding the church at Corinth. Factionalism had developed. At the fellowship meal some got drunk while others were left hungry. There seemed to be a preference for ecstatic prayer at the expense of works of charity, with a number of members all \\"speaking in tongues\\" at the same time. It was apparently reported to him that women were appearing at the assembly without the head covering customary in contemporary Greek society, and may have been arguing over their right to address the assembly. The fledgling community appeared to be in disorder.\\"1 Corinthians\\", Introduction, NAB, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2003 1 Corinthians 14:33-35(NIV) states: Barbara Leonhard and others\\"1 Corinthians 14\\", note 10, NAB, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2003 find this contradicts a statement in 1 Corinthians 11:5 that seems to presuppose that women are, in fact, praying and prophesying in the assembly of believers (but prefers they do it with the appropriate head covering). Leonhard notes that it is inconsistent with Paul's dealings with his co-workers in that women such as Prisca, Phoebe and Junia could not have functioned as Church leaders and apostles if they were not allowed to speak in public. She and other such as Jerome Murphy-O'Connor believe this to be a \\"post-Pauline interpolation\\". According to Murphy-O'Connor, in the New Jerome Biblical Commentary: However, David Odell-Scott disagrees with the modern interpolation hypothesis, and instead supports the notion that verses 34-35 are indeed an earlier Corinthian slogan which Paul is critiquing and correcting.Odell-Scott, D.W. \\"Editorial dilemma: the interpolation of 1 Cor 14:34‚Äì35 in the western manuscripts of D, G and 88.\\" Web: 23 Mar 2018. Odell-Scott notes that the injunction for silence and subordination in verses 34-35 is immediately followed by an incredulous reply in the form of a negative rhetorical query in verse 36 (RSV): By this interpretation, verse 36 is a Pauline refutation of a Corinthian opponent quoted and critiqued by the evangelist. Odell-Scott further argues that those western manuscripts that moved 34-35 to a different position (after verse 40) are the work of a patriarchal redactor seeking to \\"shelter\\" and protect the Corinthian slogan from Paul's emphatic critique in verse 36. By associating these verses with the \\"decency and order\\" of verse 40, the redactor undermined the egalitarian interpretation of the canonical version, and incorrectly presented the Corinthian voice as the voice of Paul. Thus the ancient editor effectively harmonized the text with the parallel passage of 1 Timothy. However this variant version of 1 Corinthians was not canonized. Nonetheless, many English translations of verse 36 omit the key \\"heta\\" particle (translated as \\"What!\\" or \\"What?\\"). Translations may thus serve to diminish the contradictory tone of the interrogative verse 36, and preserve the sense of harmony with 1 Timothy. First Epistle to Timothy The First Epistle to Timothy is presented as a letter from Paul in Macedonia to Timothy in Ephesus. It is termed one of the \\"pastoral epistles\\" in that it is not directed to a particular congregation but to a pastor in charge of caring for a community of believers. 1 Timothy 2: 9-15 (NASB) says: Since the nineteenth century, the attribution to Paul of the \\"pastoral letters\\" has come into question. There are a wide variety of opinions as what extent, if any, Paul either wrote or influenced their composition. If Paul wrote them, the date of composition is likely 63‚Äì67; if not their date may be as late as the early second century.\\"1 Timothy\\", Introduction, NAB, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2003 While acknowledging a degree of patriarchalism in Paul, according to Bernard Robinson, former Lecturer in Sacred Scripture at Ushaw College, Durham, most scholars think that Paul is not the author; and that 1 Timothy probably comes from the end of first century, at a time when the church had become somewhat more institutional and patriarchal than it was in Paul‚Äôs day.Robinson, Bernard. \\"St Paul and Women: Was the Apostle a Misogynist or a Feminist?\\", January 2010 Headship A New Testament passage that has long been interpreted to require a male priority in marriage are these verses: \\"Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord\\", and \\"the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church\\". Both Christian Egalitarians and Complementarians agree that the Apostle Paul wrote that the \\"husband is head\\" and \\"wives, submit\\", and that he was divinely inspired to write what he wrote, but the two groups diverge in their interpretation of this passage. Christian Egalitarians believe that full partnership in an equal marriage is the most biblical view. As persons, husband and wife are of equal value. There is no priority of one spouse over the other. In truth, they are one. Bible scholar Frank Stagg and Classicist Evelyn Stagg write that husband-wife equality produces the most intimate, wholesome and mutually fulfilling marriages. They conclude that the Apostle Paul's statement recorded in , sometimes called the \\"Magna Carta of Humanity\\", applies to all Christian relationships, including Christian marriage: \\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\\"See Christians for Biblical Equality for example Christian Egalitarian theologians also find it significant that the \\"two becoming one\\" concept, first cited in , was quoted by Jesus in his teachings on marriage. In those passages he reemphasized the concept by adding to the Genesis passage these words: \\"So, they are no longer two, but one\\" (NIV). The Apostle Paul cited the Genesis 2:24 passage.Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. Woman in the World of Jesus. Philadelphia: Westminster, 1978. Much has been written concerning the meaning of \\"head\\" in the New Testament. The word used for \\"head\\", transliterated from Greek, is kephalƒì‚Äîwhich means the anatomical head of a body. Today's English word \\"cephalic\\" (s…ô-fƒÉl'ƒ≠k) means \\"Of or relating to the head; or located on, in, or near the head.\\" In the New Testament, a thorough concordance search shows that the second most frequent use of \\"head\\" (kephalƒì), after \\"the structure that connects to our neck and sits atop our bodies\\", is the metaphorical sense of \\"source\\".Kroeger, Catherine Clark. \\"Toward an Understanding of Ancient Conceptions of 'Head'.\\" Priscilla Papers, Volume 20:3, Summer 2006.Johnson, Alan F. \\"A Meta-Study of the Debate over the Meaning of 'Head' (Kephale) in Paul's Writings.\\"] Priscilla Papers, Volume 20:4, Autumn 2006 The Complementarian (also known as Traditionalist or Hierarchical) view of marriage maintains that male leadership is biblically required in marriage. Complementarians generally believe that the husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image, but that husbands and wives have different functions and responsibilities in marriage.Core Beliefs . CBMW. Retrieved on 2011-02-13. According to this view, the husband has the God-given responsibility to provide for, protect, and lead his family. Wives are expected to respect their husbands' authority and submit to it.The 2000 Baptist Faith and Message, Southern Baptist Convention, 2000 revision However, some Complementarian authors caution that a wife's submission should never cause her to \\"follow her husband into sin\\".Piper, John and Grudem, Wayne (eds.) Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism. Wheaton, IL: Crossway Books, 1991, p. 57 Submission to one's husband  Christian Egalitarian views  In , Paul maintains that \\"There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.\\" Given the number of greetings to women in and the commissioning of Phoebe‚Äîthe only person identified in the New Testament as having been commissioned by Paul, there is considerable evidence supporting Paul's being relatively egalitarian for his time. In the first century when Paul was writing passages that now appear in the New Testament, people in Roman society were judged by two sets of criteria: * The first consisted of education, skill, power, intelligence and wealth. * These factors could be outweighed by the social categories such as origin, birth, language, legal rank, social desirability, occupation, age and gender. When these categories collided, it created status inconsistency/dissonance when one's achieved status was greater than the status attributed to the person by culture and by law. Second- century deference to society Elaine Pagels maintains that the majority of the Christian churches in the second century went with the majority of the middle class in opposing the trend toward equality for women. By the year 200, the majority of Christian communities endorsed as canonical the \\"pseudo- Pauline\\" letter to Timothy. That letter, according to Pagels, stresses and exaggerates the antifeminist element in Paul's views: \\"Let a woman learn in silence in all submissiveness. I permit no woman to teach or have authority over men; she is to keep silent.\\" She believes the letters to the Colossians and to the Ephesians, which order women to \\"be subject in everything to their husbands\\", do not express what she says were Paul's very favorable attitudes toward women, but also were \\"pseudo-Pauline\\" forgeries.

It is actually not an island but is connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land. It was originally a sandbank in San Diego Bay, visible only at low tide. It was built up into dry land using material dredged from the bay in 1934.\\"YACHTING: Its History In San Diego\\", Journal of San Diego History, Fall 1974, Volume 20, Number 4. It was developed in the 1950s and contains hotels, restaurants, marinas, and public parkland. Shelter Island is owned and controlled by the Port of San Diego, which also provides all police and other public services. Shelter Island businesses lease their location from the Port.San Diego Port Tenants Association Under California law, property on Shelter Island cannot be sold and permanent residences cannot be built there, because the area falls under the law governing public tidelands.Limitations on State Disposal of Lands The \\"island\\" is long and only a few hundred feet wide. A single street, Shelter Island Drive, runs the length of Shelter Island and also connects it to the mainland via a causeway lined with marine-related businesses. History and development Shelter Island was first recorded on a United States coast and geodetic map as a \\"mudbank\\". It was gradually formed by deposit of soil and sand from the San Diego River. The sandbar was used to dump materials from dredging of San Diego Bay for US Navy requirements in World War II which required a deepening of the harbor channel, further building it up. In the late 1940s The San Diego Harbor Commission undertook a dredging program that provided a new entrance to the yacht basin, and the dredged material was used to connect Shelter Island with Point Loma, and to further raise the island 14 feet above low tide; then another project raised it 7 feet above high tide. In 1960, the media described Shelter Island as \\"something from nothing\\", \\"a testimonial to human ingenuity\\", and \\"a man made wonderland of sub-tropical splendor\\".Los Angeles Times, 10-9-1960, \\"Shelter Island Result of Man's Ingenuity\\", Per a special city overlay zone, all buildings on Shelter Island are supposed to follow a \\"Polynesian\\" theme, which was very popular in the 1950s when the area was first developed and attracted a concentration of multiple exotically themed restaurants and \\"tiki bars\\". Still operating since 1954, the famous Bali Hai restaurant has a tiki bar and its own yacht dock; in its early days it had Polynesian floor shows. The Half Moon Inn, with its attached Humphrey‚Äôs restaurant and summer concert venue, also retains a Polynesian theme. The Kona Kai Club still exists but has been remodeled to a Spanish theme. Many of the original tiki-themed buildings such as L'Escale, Shelter Isle Inn, and Kona Inn have been demolished. Attractions Shelter Island Marina Shelter Island contains one yacht club, the Silvergate Yacht Club, and it creates a sheltered harbor for two others, the San Diego Yacht Club and the Southwestern Yacht Club. Shelter Island is known as a destination for superyachts\\"San Diego: The new super-yacht capital?\\", CNN, March 5, 2009. because it contains one of the few marinas in San Diego Bay with a deep enough harbor for these oversized vessels.

They toured throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe with other American bands, including Liars, !!!, and The Apples in Stereo.  The False Alarms (2013)  The band's third album was released March 19, 2013, on the Asthmatic Kitty label. The music is in a style the band calls \\"Opera-House\\", which they describe as \\"beat-driven electronica with grand, operatic gestures and lyrically-dense storytelling.\\" In a departure from their previous use of multiple lead singers, Loa performs all ten tracks.  Other projects During a month-long residency at The Echo nightclub in Los Angeles, the band featured different shows each night one show invited guest singers found via Craigslist to perform with the band as a sort of live karaoke; another night saw metal band Viscera playing exclusively Fol Chen covers. In November 2010, Goldman and Loa traveled to Saint Petersburg, Russia, to perform two long-form, constructivist-inspired reworkings of the two studio albums, followed by a workshop and recording session where they invited local musicians (and curious non-musicians) to join them in building a new Fol Chen song. On July 28, 2011, Goldman and Loa held a workshop at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis to introduce the Fol Chen Verbal Algorithm Composer-Free Song Generator, produced with the Los Angeles‚Äìbased arts organization Machine Project. The project allowed museum visitors to record their experience with a piece of art and have it converted into a song that they could take home. The band collaborated with Monome, a computer-manufacturing company, in late 2011 to make the Tetrafol, a motion- sensitive pyramidal sound device. The Tetrafol came pre-loaded with Fol Chen samples but allowed users to apply their own sounds. The band released two singles made with the device and sold a limited run of 100 units.

There are three types of Deritend ware; a fine to moderately sandy, micaceous orange to red ware (Glazed Deritend ware), used mainly for jugs, with some examples of bowls, dripping trays and aquamaniles, dating to the 13th to early 14th centuries; a black or, less frequently, grey ware with a brown core (Reduced Deritend ware), also micaceous, used mainly for cooking pots/jars and less commonly for large unglazed jugs and skillets/pipkins, dating from possibly the late 12th century to the early 14th century; and a sandy brown ware with grey core (Deritend cooking pot ware) used for cooking pots, dating from possibly the late 12th century to 13th century. Wasters i.e. pottery misfires have been found for all three wares in Birmingham. Glazed Deritend ware jugs were decorated with white slip (liquid clay) lines and applied white clay strips, often roller stamped, and white clay pads, The more complex (and later) decorative schemes are in the North French style (c. AD 1275-1325); the decorated jugs closely resemble London-type ware and it is distinctly possible that the Deritend ware industry included migrant potters from the London area in the thirteenth century. Deritend Ware was produced in the Digbeth, Deritend and Bull Ring areas of Birmingham in kilns that were probably located in the back yards of houses. The orange clay is the Mercia Mudstone that underlies this area of Birmingham and would have been obtained locally, while the white clay would have been brought from further afield. Evidence for the manufacture of Deritend ware in Birmingham was first discovered during the widening of High Street, Deritend in 1953, when misfired fragments of pottery were found to the south of the main road. Further evidence has since been found at the Old Crown Inn, the Custard Factory and underneath the site of Selfridges in the Bull Ring. All three types of Deritend ware are found widely distributed in the West Midlands in Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire.

It is located on the Diyala River, 8 km north of Sadiyah. The town is populated by Arabs, Kurds and Turkmens. It experienced significant Arabization during the Saddam era. Early history Jalawla was the center of the Sasanian ≈†ƒÅ·∏è QobƒÅ·∏è Province and the Khurasan Road crossed the town. The Sasanians ultimately lost control over the town after the Battle of Jalula in 637 to Muslim invaders.  Modern history  Jalawla has been the center town of Jalawla District since its creation with a Republican decree in 1958. Prior to the decree, Jalawla was part of Saadiya District. In the 1970s, Iraq deported a large portion of the Kurdish population of the town after having denaturalized them as Arabs were encouraged to settle instead, to intensify the Arabization of the town. Of the 28,822 people enumerated in the 1977 census, 77% were Arab, 19.8% were Kurdish and Turkmens constituted 2.5% of the population. In the 1987 census, the Arab population increased to 85.2%, while the Kurdish population decreased to 12.9% and the Turkmen to 1.7%. In the 1997 census, the Arab population stood at 83.7%, the Kurdish at 14.3% and the Turkmen at 1.9%. However, these figures are all considered highly unreliable due to manipulation and Arabization. Kurdish rebels (Peshmerga) captured the town on 12 March 1991 during the uprisings. The town later experienced assaults from the Iraqi-backed People's Mujahedin of Iran which had taken part in the repression of the nationwide uprisings. After the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, Kurdistan Region pressured Arab settlers in Khanaqin to settle in Jalawla which increased the Arab population further. Moreover, many Kurds returned to the town but left again due to the lack of security. Concurrently, the Arab al-Shuraifi tribe, which had settled in the area in the 1970s, was expelled from both Jalawla and Khanaqin after direct order from Kurdish politician Jalal Talabani.  ISIS and the aftermath  According to some estimates, 80% of the population was Arab when ISIS entered the town in 2014, while more than 85% of the former Kurdish population lived in IDP camps and nearby towns. From August to November 2014 the city was mostly under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria after having seized the town from Peshmerga in August 2014. On 23 November 2014, the PMF and Peshmerga jointly recaptured the city, under the command of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. The town was jointly controlled by PMF and Peshmerga until October 2017 when the Peshmerga withdrew from the area. When Jalawla was captured from ISIS, a portion of the Kurdish population returned after encouragement from the federal government, while Peshmerga stated that no member of the Arab Kerwi tribe would be allowed back after having supported ISIS. Nonetheless, the tribe returned after Peshmerga withdrew in October 2017. Moreover, the Arab animosity towards Kurds have made it possible for Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq to recruit a number of local Arabs into its ranks and marginalize the Kurdish population. However, according to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the local Sunni Arab leadership, many locals mainly support them due to fear and the exploitation of the right to return for Arabs.

Women are prominent in the story of Christ Jesus. He was born of a woman, had numerous interactions with women, and was seen first by women after his resurrection. He commissioned the women to go and tell his disciples that he is risen, which is the essential message of Christianity. High number of references to women According to New Testament scholar Dr. Frank Stagg and classicist Evelyn Stagg,Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. Woman in the World of Jesus. Westminster John Knox Pr, 1978. the synoptic Gospels of the canonical New TestamentMatthew, Mark, Luke and John contain a relatively high number of references to women. Evangelical Bible scholar Gilbert Bilezikian agrees, especially by comparison with literary works of the same epoch.Bilezikian, Gilbert. Beyond Sex Roles. Baker, 1989. Neither the Staggs nor Bilezikian find any recorded instance where Jesus disgraces, belittles, reproaches, or stereotypes a woman. These writers claim that examples of the manner of Jesus are instructive for inferring his attitudes toward women and show repeatedly how he liberated and affirmed women. Starr writes that of all founders of religions and religious sects, Jesus stands alone as the one who did not discriminate in some way against women. By word or deed he never encouraged the disparagement of a woman. Karen King concludes, based on the account of Jesus' interaction with a Syrophoenician woman in and , that \\"an unnamed Gentile woman taught Jesus that the ministry of God is not limited to particular groups and persons, but belongs to all who have faith.\\" Women as disciples The gospels of the New Testament, written toward the last quarter of the first century AD, often mention Jesus speaking to women publicly and openly against the social norms of the time.Blevins, Carolyn DeArmond, Women in Christian History: A Bibliography. Macon, Georgia: Mercer University Press, 1995. From the beginning, Jewish women disciples, including Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Susanna, had accompanied Jesus during his ministry and supported him out of their private means. King, Karen L. \\"Women in Ancient Christianity: The New Discoveries.\\" https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/first/women.html Kenneth E. BaileyBailey, Kenneth E. \\"Women in the New Testament: A Middle Eastern Cultural View,\\" Theology Matters, Jan/Feb 2000 spent 40 years as a Presbyterian professor of New Testament in Egypt, Lebanon, Jerusalem and Cyprus. He writes about Christianity from a Middle Eastern cultural view. He finds evidence in several New Testament passages that Jesus had women disciples. He first cites the reported occasion when Jesus‚Äô family appeared and asked to speak with him. Jesus replied: Bailey argues that according to Middle Eastern customs, Jesus could not properly have gestured to a crowd of men and said, \\"Here are my brother, and sister, and mother.\\" He could only have said that to a crowd of both men and women. Therefore, the disciples standing before him were composed of men and women. Women of obscurity noticed by Jesus The Gospels record several instances where Jesus reaches out to \\"unnoticeable\\" women, inconspicuous silent sufferers who blend into the background and are seen by others as \\"negligible entities destined to exist on the fringes of life.\\" Jesus notices them, recognizes their need and, \\"in one gloriously wrenching moment, He thrusts them on center stage in the drama of redemption with the spotlights of eternity beaming down upon them, and He immortalizes them in sacred history.\\" Peter's mother-in-law ;, , The three synoptic gospels all record the healing of Simon Peter's mother-in-law. When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He healed the woman of fever by touching her hand. She rose and began to wait on him. With this particular healing, something unique occurs. Quite often, after being healed, people left Jesus to go about their renewed lives. Peter's mother-in-law, however, immediately rose and began to \\"serve\\" him. The woman who touched Jesus' garment Illustration by Paolo Veronese of Jesus healing the woman with a flow of blood. ; Jesus practiced the ministry of touch, sometimes touching the \\"untouchables\\" and letting them touch him. Among the things considered defiling (disqualifying one for the rituals of religion) was an issue of blood, especially menstruation or hemorrhage. One such woman had been plagued with a flow of blood for 12 years, no one having been able to heal her. She found the faith in a crowd to force her way up to Jesus, approaching him from behind so as to remain inconspicuous, and simply touching his garment. When she did, two things happened: the flows of blood stopped and she was discovered. Jesus turned and asked who touched him. The disciples tried to brush aside the question, protesting that in such a crowd no individual could be singled out. Jesus pressed his inquiry and the woman came and trembled at his feet; she explained her reason and declared amid the crowd what blessing had come to her. Jesus treated her as having worth, not rebuking her for what the Levitical code of holiness would have considered as defiling him. Rather, he relieved her of any sense of guilt for her seemingly rash act, lifted her up and called her \\"Daughter.\\" He told her that her faith saved her, gave her his love, and sent her away whole. Fontaine writes, \\"The 'chutzpah' shown by the woman who bled for 12 years as she wrests her salvation from the healer's cloak is as much a measure of her desperation as it is a testimony to her faith.\\"Fontaine, Carole R. (1996), \\"Disabilities and Illness in the Bible: A Feminist Perspective\\", written at Sheffield, U.K., in Athalya Brenner, A Feminist Companion to The Hebrew Bible in the New Testament (1st ed.), Sheffield Academic Press Fontaine comments that \\"the Bible views women as a group of people who are fulfilled, legitimated, given full membership into their community, and cared for in old age by their children,\\" and that barren women risked ostracism from their communities. She notes that when disabled people are healed, the act \\"emphasizes primarily the remarkable compassion of the one doing the good deed, not the deserving nature or dignity of the recipient.\\" Daughter of Jairus ; Jairus was one of the rulers of the Jewish synagogue, and had a daughter who had been very ill and was now at the point of death. She was an only daughter, and was twelve years of age. So hearing that Jesus was near, Jairus came to Jesus, and, falling down before him, implored Jesus to come and see his sick daughter. She had been comatose, and in her father says she is already dead. Jesus went to her, even though the others mocked him and said it was too late. When he saw her body, he took her by the hand and said to her, \\"Talitha koum,\\" which means, \\"Little girl, I say to you, arise!\\" She immediately arose and walked around. He gave strict orders that no one should know this and said that she should be given something to eat. Widow of Nain ; The widow lived in a remote small town on a hillside in Galilee. However, the death of her only son left her with little means of support. Jesus noticed the grieving woman in the funeral procession. Jesus gave the command \\"Arise!\\" and gave the bewildered son back to his mother. \\"They all knew that God had a special love for the little widow with one son in Nain of Galilee.\\" The woman bent double ; Jesus was teaching in a synagogue on the Sabbath and saw a woman who had been \\"crippled by a spirit for eighteen years\\". She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. He called to the woman, said \\"Woman, you are set free from your infirmity\\", then laid his hands on her body, and immediately she straightened up and praised God. The synagogue ruler, the defender of the Sabbath, was indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. Rather than confront Jesus, he rebuked the woman publicly by saying to the whole congregation, \\"There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath\\".cf. In response, Jesus said, \\"You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water? Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?\\" The Staggs emphasize that this is the only reference in New Testament to \\"a daughter of Abraham\\". They conclude that Jesus spoke of this woman as though she belonged to the family of Abraham just as much as did the sons of Abraham. Women as models of faith Jesus who always kept his covenant of chastity presented women as models of faith to his listeners. In the culture of the day, women were neither to be seen nor heard since they were considered \\"corrupting influences to be shunned and disdained.\\" The widow of Zarephath ; The Queen of the South ; Parable of the ten virgins ; The persistent widow ; A poor widow's offering ;, Jesus honors a poor widow who cast \\"two copper coins\\" into the Temple treasury. What the widow gave to God was the totality of her belongings. Women had only limited access to the Temple in Jerusalem. There Jesus found the most praiseworthy piety and sacrificial giving, not in the rich contributors, but in a poor woman. Women as models of Jesus' work In the Parable of the Lost Coin and the Parable of the Leaven, Jesus presents his own work and the growth of the Kingdom of God in terms of a woman and her domestic work.Ben Witherington, Women in the Ministry of Jesus: A study of Jesus' attitudes to women and their roles as reflected in his earthly life, Cambridge University Press, 1987, , p. 39‚Äì41. These parables follow the Parable of the Lost Sheep and the Parable of the Mustard Seed respectively, and share the same messages as their more male-oriented counterparts. Joel B. Green writes of the Parable of the Leaven that Jesus \\"asks people ‚Äî male or female, privileged or peasant, it does not matter ‚Äî to enter the domain of a first-century woman and household cook in order to gain perspective on the domain of God.\\"Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , p. 527. Women as persons of value Raising their dead The Gospels describe three miracles of Jesus raising persons from the dead. In two out of those three incidents the dead are restored to women--to Mary and Martha their brother Lazarus and to the unnamed widow from Nain her only son. Warning against lust ; In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus expounded upon the Ten Commandments. He defended the value of women by equating men's lust to adultery, punishable by hell. Warning against divorce ; Jesus expounded upon the Book of Deuteronomy. Regarding men's custom of divorce, he defended the rights of wives by equating unjustified divorce with the guilt of causing the sin of adultery. Women as first resurrection witnesses After the Resurrection of Jesus, he chose to appear first to a group of women and gave them the privilege of proclaiming his resurrection and communicating his instructions to the Apostles.. In the story, appearing first to them implies his claim was not dishonest because a rational deceiver would not appear to witnesses that could not testify in court (i.e., the group of women). Mary, mother of Jesus At the Temple in Jerusalem ; The canonical Gospels offer only one story about Jesus as a boy‚ÄîLuke's story about the boy Jesus in the Jerusalem Temple. According to Luke, his parents, Joseph and Mary, took the 12-year-old Jesus to Jerusalem on their annual pilgrimage to the Passover. Mary and Joseph started their journey home without Jesus, thinking he was somewhere in the caravan with kinsmen or acquaintances. When his parents found him three days later, Mary said, \\"Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.\\" The boy Jesus respectfully but firmly reminded her of a higher claim he must answer: \\"Didn't you know I had to be about my Father's business?\\" It is noteworthy that in obedience to his parents, Jesus left and was subject to them. At the wedding in Cana of Galilee ; Mary told Jesus the wine was in short supply. Today his reply may seem curt: \\"Woman, what have I to do with you? My hour is not yet come.\\" Neither here nor elsewhere does Jesus renounce the mother-son relationship as such, but here, as in , he declares his vocational (ministerial) independence of his mother. He has an \\"hour\\" to meet, and Mary, though his mother, can neither hasten nor hinder its coming. Most scholars believe that in Jesus' reply to his mother there was no disrespect. According to Matthew Henry's Commentary, he used the same word when speaking to Mary with affection from the cross.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?com=mhc&b;=43&c;=2 Scholar Lyn M. Bechtel disagrees with this reading. She writes that the use of the word \\"woman\\" in reference to Jesus' mother is \\"startling. Although it would not be improper or disrespectful to address an ordinary woman in this way (as he often does: see , , ), it is inappropriate to call his mother 'woman'\\" . Bechtel further argues that this is a device Jesus uses to distance himself from Judaism. However, Bishop William Temple says there is no English phrase that represents the original \\"Woman, leave me to myself.\\" \\"In the Greek it is perfectly respectful and can even be tender‚Äîas in ... We have no corresponding term; 'lady' is precious, and 'madam' is formal. So we must translate simply and let the context give the tone.\\"William Temple, Readings in St John's Gospel. London: MacMillan, 1961. p. 35,36 Some versions of the Bible translate it as \\"Dear woman\\". ( NLT; NCV; AMP) At the foot of the cross ; Jesus, being Mary's firstborn son, took the responsibility of caring for his aging mother's future. Soon before he died, Jesus made arrangements for the disciple whom Jesus loved to take care of her. Mary Magdalene Mary Magdalene (also called Miriam of Magdala) is among the women depicted in the New Testament who accompanied Jesus and his twelve apostles, and who also helped to support the men financially. According to , , , and , she was one of the women who remained at Jesus' crucifixion. The New Testament says she saw Jesus laid in a tomb. reports that after his resurrection, Jesus appeared first to Mary Magdalene. The New Testament also says that Jesus had cast seven demons out of her. For centuries, Mary Magdalene was identified in Western Christianity as an adulteress and repentant prostitute, although nowhere does the New Testament identify her as such. In the late 20th century, discoveries of new texts and changing critical insight brought this into question. According to Harvard theologian Dr. Karen King, Mary Magdalene was a prominent disciple and leader of one wing of the early Christian movement that promoted women's leadership.King, Karen I. \\"Women in Ancient Christianity: the New Discoveries.\\" Public Broadcasting System (PBS) Frontline: From Jesus to Christ‚ÄîThe First Christians. Online: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/first/women.html. Accessed 01‚Äì11‚Äì2008. King cites references in the Gospel of John that the risen Jesus gives Mary special teaching and commissions her as an \\"apostle to the apostles.\\" She is the first to announce the resurrection and to play the role of an apostle, although the term is not specifically used of her (though, in Eastern Christianity she is referred to as \\"Equal to the Apostles\\"). Later tradition, however, names her as \\"the apostle to the apostles.\\" King writes that the strength of this literary tradition makes it possible to suggest that historically Mary was a prophetic visionary and leader within one sector of the early Christian movement after the death of Jesus. Asbury Theological Seminary Bible scholar Ben Witherington III confirms the New Testament account of Mary Magdalene as historical: \\"Mary was an important early disciple and witness for Jesus.\\"Witherington, Ben III. \\"Mary, Mary, Extraordinary,\\" http://www.beliefnet.com/story/135/story_13503_1.html He continues, \\"There is absolutely no early historical evidence that Miriam's (Mary's) relationship with Jesus was anything other than that of a disciple to her Master teacher.\\" Jeffrey Kripal, Chair of Rice University's Department of Religious Studies, writes that Christian Gnostic texts put Mary Magdalene in a central position of authority, but these texts were excluded from orthodox Biblical canons. Kripal describes Mary Magdalene as a tragic figure who maintained an important role later diminished by the male church leadership . Kripal explains that gnostic texts suggest an intimate, possibly sexual relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene, but that Jesus' sexuality is absolutely ambiguous based on the available evidence: \\"The historical sources are simply too contradictory and simultaneously too silent on the matter\\". According to Kripal, the gnostic texts \\"consistently [present] Mary as an inspired visionary, as a potent spiritual guide, as Jesus' intimate companion, even as the interpreter of his teaching\\". Kripal writes that theologies of the European Middle Ages likely invented the notion of a sexual relationship between Mary Magdalene and Jesus: \\"The medieval Catharists and Albigensians, for example, held that Mary was Jesus' concubine. The great Protestant reformer Martin Luther also assumed a sexual relationship between the two, perhaps to give some historical precedent for his own dramatic rejection of Catholic celibacy\\". The woman taken in adultery \\"The adulterous woman\\" by Lorenzo Lotto. ; This story, beloved for its revelation of God's mercy toward sinners, is found only in John's Gospel.The earliest Greek manuscripts, the earliest translations and the earliest church fathers all lack reference to this story. Most of Christendom, however, has received this story as authoritative, and modern scholarship, although concluding firmly that it was not a part of John's Gospel originally, has generally recognized that this story describes an event from the life of Christ. Furthermore, it is as well written and as theologically profound as anything else in the Gospels. Jesus was teaching in the Temple in Jerusalem. Some scribes and Pharisees interrupted his teaching as they brought in a woman who had been taken in the very act of adultery. Their treatment of the woman is callous and demeaning. They stood her before him, declared the charge, reminded him of Moses' command that such women be stoned. More precisely, the law speaks of the death of both the man and the woman involved. We are left wondering why the man was not brought in along with the woman. \\"What do you say?\\" they asked. If he is lax toward the law, then he is condemned. But if he holds a strict line, then he has allowed them to prevail in their ungodly treatment of this woman and will be held responsible by the Romans if the stoning proceeds. After a time of silence, Jesus stooped down and wrote with his finger on the ground. It was unlawful to write even two letters on the sabbath but writing with dust was permissible (m. shabbat 7:2; 12:5). The text includes no hint of what he wrote. The woman's accusers were trying to entrap Jesus, not just the woman. To them she was a worthless object to be used to \\"catch\\" Jesus on a theological legal issue. Finally, Jesus stood up and said to the accusers, \\"Let the one among you who is without sin cast the first stone.\\" He stooped down once more and again wrote on the ground. In his answer Jesus did not condone adultery. He compelled her accusers to judge themselves and find themselves guilty‚Äîof this sin and/or others. No one could pass the test, and they slipped out one by one, beginning with the eldest. When Jesus and the woman were finally alone, he asked her a simple question, \\"Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?\\" She simply replied, \\"No one, Lord.\\" She becomes a memorable example of the fact that \\"God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Jesus says to her, \\"Neither do I condemn you. Go, and from now on no longer sin.\\" \\"Here is mercy and righteousness. He condemned the sin and not the sinner.\\" (Augustine In John 33.6) But more than that, he called her to a new life. While acknowledging that she had sinned, he turned her in a new direction with real encouragement. Jesus rejected the double standard for women and men and turned the judgment upon the male accusers. His manner with the sinful woman was such that she found herself challenged to a new self-understanding and a new life.\\"Jesus Forgives a Woman Taken in Adultery.\\" InterVarsity Press New Testament Commentaries. Oct. 2, 2009: The woman at the well in Samaria Orthodox icon of Photina, the Samaritan woman, meeting Jesus by the well. The in-depth account about Jesus and the Samaritan Woman at the Well is highly significant for understanding Jesus in several relationships: Samaritans, women, and sinners. By talking openly with this woman, Jesus crossed a number of barriers which normally would have separated a Jewish teacher from such a person as this woman of Samaria. Jesus did three things that were highly unconventional and astonishing for his cultural-religious situation: # He as a man discussed theology openly with a woman. # He as a Jew asked to drink from the ritually unclean bucket of a Samaritan. # He did not avoid her, even though he knew her marital record of having had five former husbands and now living with a man who was not her husband. The disciples showed their astonishment upon their return to the well: \\"They were marveling that he was talking with a woman. A man in the Jewish world did not normally talk with a woman in public, not even with his own wife. For a rabbi to discuss theology with a woman was even more unconventional. Jesus did not defer to a woman simply because she was a woman. He did not hesitate to ask of the woman that she let him drink from her vessel, but he also did not hesitate to offer her a drink of another kind from a Jewish \\"bucket\\" as he said to her, \\"Salvation is of the Jews.\\" Salvation was coming to the Samaritan woman from the Jews, and culturally there was great enmity between the Jews and the Samaritans (considered a half-breed race by the Jews).Deffinbaugh, Bob. \\"The Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37).\\" Bible.org. Although she was a Samaritan, she needed to be able to drink from a Jewish \\"vessel\\" (of salvation) and Jesus no more sanctioned Samaritan prejudice against Jew than Jewish prejudice against Samaritan. The key to Jesus' stance is found in his perceiving persons as persons. He saw the stranger at the well as someone who first and foremost was a person‚Äînot primarily a Samaritan, a woman, or a sinner. This evangelized woman became an evangelist. She introduced her community to \\"a man\\" whom they came to acclaim as \\"the Savior of the world.\\" Jesus liberated this woman and awakened her to a new life in which not only did she receive but also gave. The Bible says she brought \\"many Samaritans\\" to faith in Christ. If the men in were the first \\"soul winners,\\" this woman was the first \\"evangelist\\" in John's gospel. The woman from Syrophoenicia ;, This incident is unlike any other in the canonical Gospels. The woman, whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit, came and fell at his feet. The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. Jesus seems harsh toward the woman as he first denies her request for help for her daughter. He also appears to be condescending and denigrating of her as he says, \\"First let the children be fed, for it is not fitting to take the bread of the children and throw it to the dogs.\\" In the context, \\"the children\\" seem to be Jews and \\"the dogs\\" Gentiles. She is identified as \\"a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race.\\" The point is not that she is a woman, but that she is not Jewish, but a Gentile. \\"Dogs\\" was epithet of the day for Gentiles, and Jesus appears to be on the side of Jewish contempt for Gentiles. In both Mark and Matthew, non-Jews are likened to \\"dogs,\\" and a woman deeply concerned for her daughter's condition is brushed off until she herself prevails in her discourse with Jesus. As to the manner of Jesus with women, he did not substitute uncritical deference for prejudice against women. He related to women as persons with words and dignity. In this story as elsewhere, Jesus is seen as capable of manifesting a critical stance toward woman, yet at the same time being respectful of her self-affirmation as she boldly countered his own remarks. Why Jesus appeared harsh to a disadvantaged person, and also seems to lose the brief spirited and incisive dialog with her is still debated among authorities. Several interpretations have been offered by theologians. Evelyn and Frank Stagg suggest three possibilities: # Jesus could have been instructing his disciples, first assuming a familiar Jewish prejudice toward non-Jews, and then abandoning it as its unfairness was exposed. The story may have served as an object lesson about prejudice to his disciples as a barrier is broken down between Jews and Gentiles. # Jesus may have been testing the woman's faith. Jesus' parting word to her is one of affirmation and acclaim. She passed his test. # There may have been a deep struggle within Jesus as he dealt with the claims of both Jew and Gentile. He had openness to Jews who were outside of accepted circles (publicans, sinners, prostitutes). He also went out of his way to affirm Samaritans (for example, the woman at the well). As an ethnic group, Samaritans had mutual animosity with the Jews. It is clear that Jesus had to give himself unreservedly to Israel, and yet also to the rest of the world. Jesus may have been having a deep, honest struggle within himself over the claims of two worlds upon him. Gilbert Bilezekian believes Jesus' seemingly indifferent attitude to the woman's plea and the strange dialogue that followed should not be interpreted as reluctance on his part to minister either to Gentiles or to a woman. He focuses on her faith, which Jesus later describes as \\"great\\". Wanting her to state her understanding of his ministry, he drew out her convictions and provided an opportunity to teach a lesson of racial inclusiveness to his \\"intolerant disciples\\". She expressed her faith that Gentiles have a share in salvation, confessing that his messiahship transcends human segregations of Jew, Gentile, man or woman. She was his first convert in the \\"Gentile world\\". Mary and Martha Christ in the House of Martha and Mary\\" by Jan Vermeer, 1655. Luke and John show that Jesus had a close relationship with the sisters Mary and Martha who resided in Bethany. They are featured in three major stories: # A tension between the two sisters over roles # Grief at the death of their brother Lazarus, followed by his being raised, and # Martha serving and Mary anointing Jesus (explicitly in ); presumably in ; ). See the anointing in Bethany. Kitchen and study ; Luke relates an occasion of tension during one of Jesus' visits to the home of Martha and Mary. While Martha prepared the meal, Mary sat at the feet of Jesus and \\"she was hearing his word.\\" Martha became distracted and frustrated over having to serve the meal without any help from her sister. Finally she openly shared her feelings, stood over Jesus who was either seated or reclining, and complained: \\"She came to him and asked, \\"Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!\\" Jesus gently rebuked Martha for being so distracted and troubled over many things, when only one thing was necessary. \\"Martha, Martha,\\" the Lord answered, \\"you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.\\" Mary's choice was not a conventional one for Jewish women. She sat at the feet of Jesus and was listening to his teaching and religious instruction. Jewish women were not permitted to touch the Scriptures; they were not taught the Torah, although they were instructed in accordance with it for the proper regulation of their lives. A rabbi did not instruct a woman in the Torah. Mary choose the \\"good part,\\" but Jesus related it to her in a teacher-discipleship relationship. He admitted her into \\"the study\\" and commended her for her choice. In the tradition of that day, women were excluded from the altar-oriented priestly ministry, and the exclusion encroached upon the Word-oriented ministry for women. Jesus reopened the Word-ministry for woman. Mary was at least one of his students in theology. Jesus vindicated Mary's rights to be her own person‚Äîto be Mary and not Martha. He showed his approval of a woman's right to opt for the study and not be compelled to be in the kitchen. Jesus established his own priorities in declaring, \\"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word proceeding out through the mouth of God. Martha needed to be reminded of the priority of Word over bread. Luke's account of Jesus at the home of Mary and Martha puts Jesus solidly on the side of the recognition of the full personhood of woman, with the right to options for her own life. By socializing with both sisters and in defending Mary's right to a role then commonly denied to Jewish women, Jesus was following his far-reaching principle of human liberation. The grieving sisters ; One of Jesus' most famous miracles was raising Lazarus from four days in the tomb. But it is also a striking reminder that while God works all things for the best, He doesn't always do it according to the schedules we expect.\\"Lazarus.\\" Gospel.com. Oct. 2, 2009. Jesus' followers had given up hope after Lazarus' death, but Jesus had a plan to glorify God and heal Lazarus in a more spectacular way than anyone expected. The central figure, however, is Jesus, identified as \\"the resurrection and the life.\\" When the brother of Mary and Martha became ill, they sent for Jesus. For some undisclosed reason, Jesus did not arrive until four days after Lazarus died. The grieving sisters, Martha first and then Mary, met Jesus. Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead and then proclaimed himself as \\"the resurrection and the life.\\" Martha gently reproached Jesus, \\"Lord, had you been here, my brother would not have died.\\" She hastened to express full confidence that God would grant whatever Jesus asked him to grant. Martha reflected a spiritual understanding beyond that required for preparing and serving a meal. Apparently, Martha and not just Mary had benefited from the study. Mary stayed in the house until Jesus called for her. When Martha went to get her, Mary came quickly fell at Jesus' feet (Mary is at the feet of Jesus in every appearance recorded in John's gospel). She repeated the words Martha already had used: \\"Lord, had you been here my brother would not have died.\\" Jesus was deeply moved upon seeing Mary and her friends weeping. They invited Jesus to come and see the tomb where Lazarus had been laid. Jesus burst into tears. The Jews standing by understood this as reflecting Jesus's love for Lazarus, \\"see how he loved him\\" (v. 36). The foursome of Jesus, Mary, Lazarus, and Martha had a close relationship as persons, with neither denial of gender differences nor preoccupation with it. Here were persons of both genders whose mutual respect, friendship and love carried them through experiences of tension, grief, and joy. Apparently Jesus was secure enough to develop such a relationship with two sisters and their brother without fear for his reputation. When necessary, he could oppose them without fear of chauvinism. Jesus had much to do with the liberation and growth of Martha and Mary. In the account of the raising of Lazarus, Jesus meets with the sisters in turn: Martha followed by Mary. Martha goes immediately to meet Jesus as he arrives, while Mary waits until she is called. As one commentator notes, \\"Martha, the more aggressive sister, went to meet Jesus, while quiet and contemplative Mary stayed home. This portrayal of the sisters agrees with that found in .\\" When Mary meets Jesus, she falls at his feet. In speaking with Jesus, both sisters lament that he did not arrive in time to prevent their brother's death: \\"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.\\" But where Jesus' response to Martha is one of teaching calling her to hope and faith, his response to Mary is more emotional: \\"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. As the 17th-century British commentator Matthew Henry notes, \\"Mary added no more, as Martha did; but it appears, by what follows, that what she fell short in words she made up in tears; she said less than Martha, but wept more.\\" Women who anointed Jesus The Gospels present two stories of Jesus being anointed by a woman: (1) three accounts of his being anointed in Bethany, only John's account identifying Mary with the anointing; and (2) one account of Jesus being anointed by a sinful woman who definitely was neither Mary (of Mary and Martha) nor Mary Magdalene.Discussed in Van Til, Kent A. Three Anointings and One offering: The Sinful Woman in Luke 7.36-50 , Journal of Pentecostal Theology, Volume 15, Number 1, 2006, pp. 73-82(10). However, the author of this article does not himself hold to this view. The Eastern Orthodox Church views Mary Magdalene, Mary of Bethany, and the \\"sinful woman\\" as three different individuals, and also maintains that Jesus was anointed on two different occasions: once by Mary of Bethany and once by the \\"sinful woman.\\" The anointing in Bethany ;, , Jesus is quoted in Matthew as assuring that the story of a woman's sacrificial love and devotion to him will have a place in the gospel wherever preached. Mary probably anticipated Jesus' death, but that is not certain. At least her beautiful deed gave Jesus needed support as he approached his awaited hour. Each of the two sisters Mary and Martha had their own way of ministering to Jesus: Martha, perhaps being more practical, served him a meal; Mary lavishly anointed him. A narrative in which Mary of Bethany plays a central role (in at least one of the accounts) is the event reported by the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John in which a woman pours the entire contents of an alabastron of very expensive perfume over the head of Jesus. Only in the John account is the woman identified as Mary, with the earlier reference in establishing her as the sister of Martha and Lazarus. The woman's name in not given in the Gospels of Matthew and Mark. According to Mark's account, the perfume was the purest of spikenard. Some of the onlookers are angered because this expensive perfume could have been sold for a year's wages, which Mark enumerates as 300 denarii, and the money given to the poor. The Gospel of Matthew states that the \\"disciples were indignant\\" and John's gospel states that it was Judas who was most offended (which is explained by the narrator as being because Judas was a thief and desired the money for himself). In the accounts, Jesus justifies Mary's action by stating that they would always have the poor among them and would be able to help them whenever they desired, but that he would not always be with them. He says that her anointing was done to prepare him for his burial. \\"Mary seems to have been the only one who was sensitive to the impending death of Jesus and who was willing to give a material expression of her esteem for him. Jesus' reply shows his appreciation of her act of devotion.\\" Easton (1897) noted that it would appear from the circumstances that the family of Lazarus possessed a family vault and that a large number of Jews from Jerusalem came to console them on the death of Lazarus, that this family at Bethany belonged to the wealthier class of the people. This may help explain how Mary of Bethany could afford to possess quantities of expensive perfume.\\"Mary\\", Easton's Bible Dictionary, 1897. The anointing by a repentant sinner ; In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is an invited guest in the home of Simon the Pharisee. All at the table were men. During the meal a woman known as \\"a sinner\\" entered the room and anointed Jesus' feet with her tears and with some ointment. Her tears fell upon his feet and she wiped them with her hair. The Bible does not say whether she had encountered Jesus in person prior to this. Neither does the Bible disclose the nature of her sin. Women of the time had few options to support themselves financially; thus, her sin may have been prostitution. Had she been an adulteress, she would have been stoned. When Jesus permitted her to express her love and appreciation to him as she did, the host rejected it contemptuously. At a minimum, this story shows the manner of Jesus with one sinful woman. His unconditional love for both saints and sinners may have been so well known that this woman had the courage to take this great risk to publicly express her love for him for seeing her not as a sex object to be exploited, but as a person of worth. Women who ministered with Jesus ; Luke's gospel is unique in documenting that there were many women who benefited personally from Jesus' ministry, but who also ministered to him and with him‚Äîeven to the point of accompanying him and the Twelve on evangelistic journeys. Most prominent among these is Mary Magdalene. in the Greek text is one long sentence. Its three main focal points are Jesus, the Twelve, and certain women. Jesus is traveling through cities and towns, preaching the Kingdom of God, evangelizing, and accompanied by the Twelve. Other than mentioning that the Twelve were with him, nothing more is said of them here. The chief motive of the paragraph seems to be to bring into focus certain women, of whom there were \\"many\\". This passage presents them as recipients of healing at different levels of need, and also as actively participating with Jesus and the Twelve, accompanying them in their travels. Luke makes special reference to the financial support of these women to Jesus' ministry. He says there were many women. He points out that these included women who were prominent in the public life of the state as well as in the church. :: Luke's account specifies two categories of healing: evil spirits and infirmities. Jesus liberated and humanized people who otherwise were being enslaved or destroyed by forces within themselves and in society. Jesus healed many women of \\"evil spirits and infirmities\\". Only of Mary Magdalene does Luke provide any detail of her healing, stating that \\"seven demons\\" had been cast out. Presumably these \\"many\\" women had been healed of various illnesses‚Äîphysical, emotional, and mental. No specific data is provided on Mary Magdalene's \\"seven demons\\". It is significant that women whose conditions subjected them to scorn and penalty found in Jesus a Liberator who not only enabled them to find health, but who dignified them as full persons by accepting their own ministries to himself and to the Twelve. Thus, it is significant that women had such an open and prominent part in the ministry of Jesus. Luke's word for their \\"ministering\\" is widely used in the New Testament. Its noun cognate, diakonos, is variously translated \\"minister,\\" \\"servant,\\" and \\"deacon\\" (the latter for Phoebe in Romans 16:1 and in the pastoral letters). In summary, Jesus attracted to his movement a large number of women, ranging from some in desperate need to some in official circles of government. Jesus on family relationships Jesus ate with a Pharisee leader one evening. After instructing his host to include the most disadvantaged in his feasts, Jesus gave a parable of the many personal reasons why guests might refuse an invitation, including marriage and recent financial acquisitions. Jesus then addresses a great multitude and says, \\"If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters‚Äîyes, even life itself‚Äîsuch a person cannot be my disciple.\\" Various expositors suggest that \\"hate\\" is an example of comparative hyperbolic biblical language, prominent in some Eastern cultures even today, to imply \\"love less than you give me,\\" \\"compared to Christ,\\"John Wesley http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?com=wes&b;=42&c;=14 the Semitic idea of \\"lower preference,\\" a call to count the cost of following Jesus.John Darby http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?com=drby&b;=42&c;=14 When Jesus was told that his mother and brothers waited for him outside and wanted to speak to him, Jesus created a novel definition of family. He said to the people who were gathered to hear him speak, \\"Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, 'Behold my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.'\\" Twelve and no women (and no Gentiles) There were no women among the Twelve, and neither were there any Gentiles. All four listings in the New Testament of the names of the Twelve indicate that all of the Twelve were Jewish males:   The names vary in the four lists, but their male identity is clear and is often cited as biblical evidence that pastors should all be male. The New Testament gives no clear answer why the example of Jesus in choosing his apostles is not a complete overcoming of male bias. Several considerations may be placed alongside this one. Jesus advanced various principles that went beyond their immediate implementation. For example, he clearly repudiated the Jew-Samaritan antipathy, affirming not only his own Jewish kin but also the Samaritan. Yet, there are no Samaritans among the Twelve. Jesus affirmed both women and Samaritans as persons having the fullest right to identity, freedom, and responsibility, but for some undisclosed reason he included neither women nor Gentiles in his close circle of the Twelve. Perhaps custom here was so entrenched that Jesus simply stopped short of fully implementing a principle that he made explicit and emphatic: \\"Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother.\\" By selecting 12 Jewish males, Jesus may have been offering a parallel to the 12 patriarchs or 12 tribes of Israel, each headed by a son of Jacob. Another possible explanation surrounds the purpose stated for his choosing the Twelve: \\"...so that they might be with him.\\" They were his constant companions day and night‚Äîexcept when he sent them out to preach. It was the custom for Jewish rabbis to have such an entourage of disciples. \\"Such close and sustained association with a member of the opposite sex would have given rise to defamatory rumor.\\"Starr, Lee Anna. The Bible Status of Woman. Zarephath, N.J.: Pillar of Fire, 1955. However the restriction of the Twelve to Jewish men is to be accounted for, Jesus did introduce far-reaching principles which bore fruit even in a former rabbi, the Apostle Paul, who at least in vision could say, \\"There is not any Jew nor Greek, not any slave nor free, there is not male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\\" Further, the inclusion of \\"many\\" women in the traveling company of Jesus represents a decisive move in the formation of a new community. The Twelve are all men and also are all Jews, but even at this point women \\"minister\\" to them. Unless one would argue that \\"apostolic succession\\" (however adapted) is for Jews only, it cannot be argued that only men can become members of the clergy. The Staggs' believe a likely explanation to be that Jesus began where he was, within the structures of Judaism as he knew it in his upbringing. His closest companions initially may have been Jews, men, and men of about his own age. He began there, but he did not stop there. Even in the early stages of his mission, women were becoming deeply involved at the power center of Jesus' movement.

History  \\"Altvater\\" liqueur by Gessler The original company was founded in Bromberg, Prussia (today, Bydgoszcz in Poland). In 1873, the company, which supplied the entire Austro- Hungarian Empire, was reorganized in J√§gerndorf (Krnov), Silesia, and its brand name ‚ÄúAltvater‚Äù gained world renown. After the collapse of Austria- Hungary after World War I, licenses were granted to branches in Vienna, Budapest, Czernowitz (Chernivtsi), Bielitz (Bielsko) and Agram (Zagreb). The company was run and owned by Siegfried Gessler and his brother-in-law Leo Westreich, the company's former accountant. Siegfried Gessler died in 1890 and Leo Westreich in 1922, and then his wife Felice Westreich took over running the business together with her sister-in-law Sidonia Gessler (died 1925). The Nazis confiscated the business in 1939, and Felice Westreich and eldest daughter Irma were killed at Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942, Leo and Felice's daughter Gertrude L√∂wenbein was murdered in the mass shooting in the forest at Bansk√° Bystrica, Slovakia, in November 1944. Westreich's only remaining direct descendant to have survived was youngest daughter Liesl Herbst (n√©e Westreich), who was Austrian and also Moravian tennis champion of the 1930s and managed to escape to England with her husband and daughter. After the Second World War, the company was nationalized and became state operated. Eduard Gessler distantly related to the Baczewski family, bought the Altvater Gessler Company in Vienna, Austria, and reacquired the J. A. Baczewski mark. Under Eduard Gessler‚Äôs guidance, Altvater Gessler and J.A. Baczewski reunited under the combined name Altvater Gessler - J.A. Baczewski, with its principal place of business in Vienna, Austria. The reconstituted company continued to specialize in quality alcoholic products for domestic consumption in Austria and for export to various countries in various continents, to include Australia, Africa, Asia, Europe and North America, most notably the United States. Its centuries‚Äô old reputation and record of quality led to its being selected as the only representative of the Austrian liquor industry at the International World Fair in Chicago in 1950. Following Eduard Gessler‚Äôs death in 1979, his son Elek Gessler consolidated the affairs of both traditional companies into one new legal entity in 1980, which to this day is known as ‚ÄúAltvater Gessler - J.A. Baczewski, GmbH‚Äù, an Austrian corporation. In 1983, Elek Gessler established Altvater Gessler - J.A. Baczewski International (USA) Inc., a New Jersey, USA, Corporation, to manage United States operations. To this date, both companies are owned solely by the Gessler family.

AVA produced radio equipment for the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which was responsible for the radio communications of the General Staff's Intelligence Section (Oddzia≈Ç II). After the Cipher Bureau's mathematician-cryptologist Marian Rejewski in December 1932 deduced the wiring in the German Enigma rotor cipher machine, AVA produced Enigma \\"doubles\\" and all the electro-mechanical equipment that was designed at the Cipher Bureau to facilitate decryption of the German ciphers. Life Fokczy≈Ñski was an autodidact whose formal education did not extend beyond four grades of primary school at Pabianice. He worked there as a journeyman locksmith before moving in 1913 to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where he found a job in the electrical engineering firm of Knapik and Company. In 1919 Fokczy≈Ñski enlisted in the Polish Army, serving in a radio battalion and later in Field Wireless Station No. 4. Mustered out in 1922, he worked a couple of years as a technician in the infant Polish broadcasting industry, where he was judged capable, intelligent, reliable, and gifted in radio work. In 1927, Fokczy≈Ñski opened a small radio workshop in a single room in Warsaw. Sporadically he received orders from the Cipher Bureau; Captain Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki, chief of the Bureau's German section (BS 4), had known him since his army years. In 1929‚Äì32, the shop on Warsaw's New World Street, ten minutes' walk from the General Staff building, was transformed into the AVA Radio Company. The electronics firm subsequently moved to new facilities in southern Warsaw's Mokot√≥w district. On a cost-plus basis, AVA produced radio equipment for the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which was responsible for the radio communications of the General Staff's Intelligence Section (Oddzia≈Ç II). After the Cipher Bureau's mathematician-cryptologist Marian Rejewski in December 1932 deduced the wiring in the German Enigma rotor cipher machine, AVA produced Enigma \\"doubles\\" and all the electro-mechanical equipment that was designed at the Cipher Bureau to facilitate decryption of the German ciphers. The Poles' reading of German ciphers laid the foundation for the western Allies' Ultra cipher-breaking operations, beginning seven years later, during World War II. Before the war, AVA also produced the Cipher Bureau- designed Lacida rotor cipher machine. After the invasion of Poland in 1939, Fokczy≈Ñski was one of the essential Cipher Bureau and AVA personnel who made it to France to continue their war on the Enigma cipher at PC Bruno, outside Paris, where the Poles collaborated with their French and British allies. When France capitulated to Nazi Germany in June 1940, Fokczy≈Ñski and his colleagues were transported by their French host, Colonel Gustave Bertrand, to a post codenamed Cadix, outside Uz√®s, in southern, Vichy France. On 8 November 1942 the Allies landed in North Africa (Operation Torch). On 9 November Bertrand evacuated Cadix, and the Poles set out for the C√¥te d'Azur. Two days later, the Germans abruptly invaded the French Free Zone, putting an end to the collaborationist but semi-autonomous Vichy regime and, on 12 November, occupying Cadix. The Polish team sought, in small groups, to cross the Pyrenees from France into Spain. On 13 March 1943 one such expedition, which included Cipher Bureau chief Colonel Langer, Major Ciƒô≈ºki, Antoni Palluth and Fokczy≈Ñski, was arrested near Perpignan by the Gestapo. They had been betrayed by their guide. The two officers were sent to Frontstalag 122 at Compi√®gne, France, and on 9 September 1943 to the SS concentration camp, Sonderkommando Schloss Eisenberg, in Czechoslovakia; they were liberated by American forces on 10 May 1945. Palluth and Fokczy≈Ñski were sent as slave labor to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, near Berlin, where both died before war's end. Palluth was killed in an Allied air raid; Fokczy≈Ñski died from exhaustion. None of the Poles betrayed to the Germans the secret of Enigma decryption.

Adult spiders measure between 3 and 4.5 mm in length. The cephalothorax and abdomen are bronze to black in color, with reddish brown or yellowish legs. The male has distinctive enlarged chelicerae (the mouthparts used for grasping prey) and front femora (the third, and typically largest, leg segments). Like many jumping spiders, Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized courtship and agonistic behavior. Etymology The specific name is derived from the Latin sex meaning \\"six\\" and punctum meaning \\"spot\\". This is a reference to the six spots typically occurring on the abdomen of the male. History and taxonomy Hentz's original figure of the male The species was first described by entomologist Nicholas Marcellus Hentz in 1845 in the Boston Journal of Natural History. Hentz named the species Attus sexpunctatus and described it as follows: > \\"Black; cephalothorax with the two posterior eyes near the base, which is > wide and suddenly inclined at nearly a right angle with the upper surface, > cheliceres with a strong inner tooth, and a long, curved fang; abdomen with > six dots, and a line in front, white; feet, 1. 4. 2. 3., first pair with > enlarged thighs and quite long.\\" Hentz classified A. sexpunctatus in the subgeneric group Pugnatoriae, which consisted of jumping spiders whose first pair of legs were the longest, followed by the fourth pair. Later entomologists abandoned this classification, which Hentz himself admitted was \\"somewhat artificial\\". In 1888, with the recognition of Zygoballus as an independent genus, American arachnologists George and Elizabeth Peckham renamed the spider Zygoballus sexpunctatus. Specimens of Z. sexpunctatus are housed at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, the British Museum, the Milwaukee Public Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle. No type specimens are known. The genus Zygoballus contains approximately twenty species distributed from the United States to Argentina. Zygoballus is classified in the subfamily Dendryphantinae of the family Salticidae (jumping spiders). Description alt=Diagram of the mouthparts of a male Z. sexpunctatus (ventral view) According to arachnologist B. J. Kaston, adult females are 3.5 to 4.5 mm in body length, while males are 3 to 3.5 mm. The Peckhams' earlier description, however, gives a length of 3 mm for females and 3 to 4.5 mm for males. Male carapace and chelicerae (lateral view) The cephalothorax of Z. sexpunctatus is bronze to black in color. Like all Zygoballus spiders, the cephalothorax is box-like in shape, being widest at the posterior lateral eyes. Numerous white or pale blue scales cover the clypeus (\\"face\\") and chelicerae. This covering extends around the sides of the carapace, ending beyond the posterior median eyes. In males, the labium is two-fifths as long as the maxillae, and as wide as it is long. The chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented, with each chelicera having a prominent inner tooth and a long, curved fang. The legs are reddish brown, or sometimes yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, especially in the male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7 mm, 2.2 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually. The abdomen is bronze to black with a white basal band and two white transverse bands. The transverse bands are often broken to form six spots. Some or all of these spots may be lacking, however. Epigyne (ventral view). Scale equals 0.1 mm. Zygoballus sexpunctatus is similar in appearance to Zygoballus rufipes, with whom its range overlaps. The male can be distinguished from Z. rufipes by the large spot of white scales at the beginning of the thoracic slope (which is lacking in Z. rufipes), and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the pedipalp (Z. rufipes has a transverse division). The female can best be distinguished by the form of the epigyne (the external genital structure). Habitat and distribution The range of the species extends from New Jersey to Florida and west to Texas, although it is most commonly found in the southern states. Hentz collected his original specimen in North Carolina. In 1909, the Peckhams reported that the species had been collected from North Carolina, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. A seven-year survey of spider species in western Mississippi reported the abundance of Z. sexpunctatus as \\"uncommon\\". A one-year survey in Alachua County, Florida, reported the species as \\"rare\\". Specimens have been collected from several ecosystems, including old fields, river terrace forests, flatwoods, Florida Sand Pine scrub, Slash Pine forests, Appalachian grass balds, and rice fields. Robert and Betty Barnes reported the species as occurring in broomsedge fields throughout the southeastern Piedmont. The species is typically found in the herb stratum (among grasses and other short plants) and may be collected with a sweep net. Behavior alt=Photograph showing ritualized agonistic behavior between Z. sexpunctatus males Male Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders are known to exhibit elaborate courtship displays. As a male approaches a female, it will typically raise and spread its first pair of legs and vibrate its abdomen. If the female is receptive, it will often vibrate its abdomen as well. The specific patterns of courtship behavior, however, vary between individuals. Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized agonistic behavior when encountering other males of the same species. This behavior may include many of the same elements as courtship, such as raising and spreading the first pair of legs and vibrating the abdomen. During agonistic display, males will also extend their pedipalps and fangs. Lethal attacks between males appear to be rare, however. Diet and ecology Like most spiders, Zygoballus sexpunctatus is an opportunistic feeder, feeding on a wide range of invertebrate prey. The spider's diet typically includes small insects such as aphids and young caterpillars. They have also been known to eat mosquitoes and numerous kinds of small spiders. Mud dauber wasps, which capture and paralyze spiders as a source of food for their larvae, have been shown to prey on both male and female Z. sexpunctatus spiders. Life cycle In a study of spider populations in western Tennessee, Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiderlings were reported to hatch from egg sacs in mid summer. The spiders hibernated through the winter in an immature form and reached sexual maturity around late April.

This electrical activity is recorded when the heart is in a normal rhythm (sinus rhythm) to assess the conduction system of the heart and to look for additional electrical connections (accessory pathways), and during any abnormal heart rhythms that can be induced. EP studies are used to investigate the cause, location of origin, and best treatment for various abnormal heart rhythms, and are often followed by a catheter ablation during the same procedure. Preparation It is important for patients not to eat or drink for up to 12 hours before the procedure. This is to prevent vomiting, which can result in aspiration, and also cause severe bleeding from the insertion site of the catheter. Failure to follow this simple preparation may result in dangerous consequences. In general, small amounts of water can be consumed up to 2 hours before the exam. Patients should try to schedule the exam at a time when they will be having symptoms and will not need to drive for 2 to 3 days. Procedure An EP study is typically performed in an EP lab or cath lab. These are specially equipped operating rooms that usually contain an X-ray machine capable of acquiring live X-ray video images (a fluoroscope), equipment to record electrical signals from the heart, a stimulator to electrically excite the heart and control the heart rate, and ablation equipment to destroy abnormal tissue. A 3D navigation system that tracks and records the catheter position and associated electrical signals may also be used. The procedure may be performed awake under local anaesthetic, or under general anaesthetic. Monitoring equipment is attached including an automated blood pressure cuff and a pulse oximeter to measure the oxygen saturation of the blood. A peripheral venous cannula is generally inserted to allow medication to be given such as sedatives, anesthesia, or drugs. An access site that will allow catheters to be passed to the heart via an artery or vein is shaved and cleaned, usually in the groin. The blood vessels used to reach the heart (the femoral or subclavian veins, and sometimes the femoral artery) are punctured before a guidewire and plastic sheath are inserted into the vessel using the Seldinger technique. EP Study and inducibility Once the catheter is in and all preparations are complete elsewhere in the lab, the EP study begins. The X-ray machine will give the doctor a live view of the heart and the position of the electrodes. He will guide the (steerable) electrodes to the correct position inside the heart. The electrophysiologist begins by moving the electrodes along the conduction pathways and along the inner walls of the heart, measuring the electrical activity along the way. The next step is pacing the heart, this means he/she will speed up or slow down the heart by placing the electrode at certain points along the conductive pathways of the heart and control the depolarization rate of the heart. The doctor will pace each chamber of the heart one by one, looking for any abnormalities. Then the electrophysiologist tries to provoke arrhythmias and reproduce any conditions that have resulted in the patient's placement in the study. This is done by injecting electric current into the conductive pathways and into the endocardium at various places. Last, the electrophysiologist may administer various drugs (proarrhythmic agents) to induce arrhythmia (inducibility of VT/VF). If the arrhythmia is reproduced by the drugs (inducible), the electrophysiologist will search out the source of the abnormal electrical activity. The entire procedure can take several hours.  Ablation  If at any step during the EP study the electrophysiologist finds the source of the abnormal electrical activity, they may try to ablate the cells that are misfiring. This is done using high-energy radio frequencies (similar to microwaves) to effectively heat up the abnormal cells, to form scar tissue. This can be painful with pain felt in the heart itself, the neck and shoulder areas. A more recent method of ablation is cryoablation, which is considered less risky and less painful. Recovery When the necessary procedures are complete, the catheter is removed. Firm pressure is applied to the site to prevent bleeding. This may be done by hand or with a mechanical device. Other closure techniques include an internal suture and plug. If the femoral artery was used, the patient will probably be asked to lie flat for several hours (3 to 6) to prevent bleeding or the development of a hematoma. Trying to sit up or even lift the head is strongly discouraged until an adequate clot has formed. The patient will be moved to a recovery area where he/she will be monitored. For patients who had a catheterization at the femoral artery or vein (and even some of those with a radial insertion site), in general recovery is fairly quick, as the only damage is at the insertion site. The patient will probably feel fine within 8 to 12 hours after the procedure, but may feel a small pinch at the insertion site. After a short period of general rest, the patient may resume some minor activity such as gentle, short, slow walks after the first 24 hours. If stairs must be climbed, they should be taken one step at a time and very slowly. All vigorous activity must be postponed until approved by a physician. It is also important to note that unless directed by a doctor, some patients should avoid taking blood thinners and foods that contain salicylates, such as cranberry-containing products until the clot has healed (1‚Äì2 weeks). Complications As with any surgical procedure, cardiac catheterizations come with a generic list of possible complications. One of the complications that are sometimes reported involves some temporary nerve involvement. Sometimes a small amount of swelling occurs that can put pressure on nerves in the area of the incision. Venous thrombosis is the most common complication with an incidence ranging between 0.5 and 2.5%. There have been reports of patients feeling like they have hot fluid like blood or urine running down their leg for up to a month or two after the incision has healed. This usually passes with time, but patients should tell their doctor if they have these symptoms and if they last. More severe but relatively rare complications include: damage or trauma to a blood vessel, which could require repair; infection from the skin puncture or from the catheter itself; cardiac perforation, causing blood to leak into the sac around the heart and compromising the heart's pumping action, requiring removal using a needle under the breast bone (pericardiocentesis); hematoma at the site(s) of the puncture(s); induction of a dangerous cardiac rhythm requiring an external shock(s); a clot may be dislodged, which may travel to a distant organ and impede blood flow or cause a stroke; myocardial infarction; unanticipated reactions to the medications used during the procedure; damage to the conduction system, requiring a permanent pacemaker; death.

His last appearance in a Tigers shirt was as a late substitution in the Pilkington Cup final triumph over Sale in 1997.http://www.leicestertigers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11472&sid;=059264be53396d67b7842f39866410c5&PHPSESSID;=7d02e0d8d1f4315 ...

The painting depicts a young woman wearing an ermine-trimmed jacket and enormous pearl earrings as she eagerly looks out a window, presumably expecting a male visitor. \\"A musical courtship is suggested by the viola da gamba on the floor in the foreground and by the flow of songbooks across the tabletop and onto the floor,\\" according to a web page about the work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art website. The tuning of a lute was recognized by contemporary viewers as a symbol of the virtue of temperance. The oil on canvas work is 20¬º inches high and 18 inches wide (51.4 √ó 45.7 cm). The painting's canvas was almost certainly cut from the same bolt as that used for Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid. The work likely was painted shortly after Young Woman with a Water Pitcher, and it shares with that painting its framing of the figure within rectangular motifs. But the painting has more muted tones, reflecting a shift in that direction by Vermeer in the mid- to late 1660s. At this time, Vermeer began using shadows and soft contours to further evoke an atmosphere of intimacy. \\"The impression of spatial recession and atmosphere is somewhat diminished by darkening with age of the objects in the foreground and by abrasion of the paint surface, mostly in the same area,\\" according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art web page. The painting was given to the museum in 1900 by a bequest of railroad industrialist Collis P. Huntington.

Background On October 18, 1991, the Azerbaijani parliament adopted a constitutional act recognizing the independence of Azerbaijan. Subsequently, the Soviet Union fell apart on December 25, 1991, and on that same day Canada recognized the independence of Azerbaijan along with 11 other post-Soviet states. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established on August 10, 1992. The Ambassador of Canada to Turkey is also accredited to Azerbaijan, while Azerbaijan opened its embassy in Ottawa in 2004.  Friendship Group  Canada-Azerbaijan Inter-Parliamentary Friendship Group was established in Canada in November 2006, under the chairmanship of Canadian Parliamentary Conservatives Party member Barry Devolin. Azerbaijan-Canada Working Group on Interparliamentary Relations operates in the National Assembly of Azerbaijan . This working group was established on December 5, 2000 and its first head was Samur Novruzov. Fuad Muradov has been the head of the group since 4 March 2016. Economic Relations Canadian firms are active in Azerbaijan's oil and gas industry and Canada is seeking to increase its stake in the petroleum and energy transmission sector. Bilateral trade was C$12.6 million in 2004 and represented mostly Canadian exports. On September 7, 2004, the governments of Canada and Azerbaijan signed a bilateral Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital. In 2008, Canada's total import from Azerbaijan reached $1.168.295 billion. The same year Canada's export to Azerbaijan amounted $19.713 million. In 2010, Canadian imports to Azerbaijan were $542 million, down significantly from $1.2 billion in 2009. Merchandise exports to Azerbaijan were also down from $31.0 million the previous year to $20 million in 2010. CIDA provides funding for Canadian technical assistance to Azerbaijan through regional projects and a Canada Fund for local development projects is managed by the Canadian Embassy in Ankara, Turkey.

Descriptive image link Cause This fracture occurs in patients who have fallen from a height.  Diagnosis  The injury can be difficult to diagnose initially as the attention is focused on the injury to the radial head, leading to the distal radio-ulnar injury being overlooked. The examination finding of tenderness of the distal radio-ulnar joint suggests an Essex- Lopresti injury in patients who have sustained high energy forearm trauma. Plain radiography shows the radial head fracture, with dorsal subluxation of the ulna often seen on lateral view of the pronated wrist.  Management  The radial head fracture is usually managed by open reduction internal fixation; if the fracture is too comminuted, a radial head implant can be used. Excision of the radial head should be avoided, as the radius will migrate proximally leading to wrist pain and loss of pronation and supination of the wrist. Delayed treatment of the radial head fracture will also lead to proximal migration of the radius. The distal radio-ulnar joint dislocation can be reduced by supination of the forearm, and may be pinned in place for 6 weeks to allow healing of the interosseous membrane.

Probably, Plenty and Daredevil) is a Serbian alternative rock band from Belgrade.  History   Formation, first releases (1991-1995)  The band, consisting Nektarijeviƒá (vocals), Rastko Lupuloviƒá (guitar), Vladislav Rac (bass guitar) Stevan Dimitrijeviƒá (drums), was formed in 1991. They were soon joined by Marko Petronijeviƒá (trumpet). Having performed for two years, and winning the Palilula Culture Olympics, the band went on hiatus as vocalist Nektarijeviƒá went to the United States of America. On his return, in 1994, the band continued working, releasing their debut album Guarda Toma! in 1996. The album, featuring live recordings, made on May and October 1995 at the Belgrade KST, and studio material, including \\"Put za Tunu\\" (\\"The Road to Tuna\\"), \\"Priroda\\" (\\"Nature\\"), featuring guest appearance by Darkwood Dub vocalist Dejan \\"Vuƒça\\" Vuƒçetiƒá, \\"Toma Bebiƒá\\", dedicated to the singer Toma Bebiƒá, \\"Visokogradnja\\" (\\"Buildings\\") and \\"Sisa\\" (\\"Tit\\"), the latter two already being released on the various artists compilation Mi smo za mir (We Are for Peace). The band, combining funk and jazz with rock, with Nektarijeviƒá's reggae vocal interpretations, soon became a leading club rock act and a live attraction.  Success and disbandment (1996‚Äì2001) In 1996, guitarist Rastko Lupuloviƒá, also working as an actor, made the decision to become a monk, parting to the Visoki Deƒçani monastery, and getting the monk name Ilarion. In April 1998, the band released the album Igraƒçka plaƒçka, partially featuring material written by Lupuloviƒá. The album was produced by ≈Ωeljko Bo≈æiƒá, and featured the new guitarist Ivan Topisiroviƒá, a Superstar member and former Fake Madonna's Underwear member. Well acclaimed by the critics, the album featured the tracks \\"S.A.T\\", \\"≈†tastopojo\\" (\\"Whatveyoueaten\\"), \\"Right Direction\\", \\"Proƒái ƒáe i njihovo\\" (\\"Theirs Would Also Pass\\"), and \\"≈†AFL\\" (\\"SHUFFLE\\"), combining reggae, acid-jazz and funk. The band also appeared on the Korak napred 2 koraka nazad (A Step Forward 2 Steps Backwards) various- artists compilation with the cover version of Disciplina Kiƒçme song \\"Manitua Mi II\\". A remastered edition of the album appeared in 2000. The following album, Become, released in 2000, featuring guest appearances by Eyesburn frontman Nemanja Kojiƒá, former Plejboj member Du≈°an Petroviƒá and Deca Lo≈°ih Muziƒçara member Bora Veliƒçkoviƒá, had the song lyrics entirely written in English. The album, produced by Goran ≈Ωivkoviƒá and Sandra Stojadinoviƒá and post-produced by Velja Mitroviƒá, presented the band with a personal approach to reggae music. The album featured the former Superstar member Vladan Rajoviƒá on drums, soon replaced by former Kazna Za U≈°i and Del Arno Band member Dejan Utvar. In 2001, the band appeared on the Munje (Lightning Flashes) movie soundtrack with the song \\"Izlazim\\" (\\"I am Getting Out\\"). Also, the material from the debut album, previously available only on compact cassette, was re- released on CD with the Veliki Prezir debut album by Metropolis Records. The band stopped working in spring 2001, when Nektarijeviƒá moved to Los Angeles.  Reformation (2003-present)  In 2003, the reformed Kanda, Kod≈æa i Neboj≈°a, featuring Nektarijeviƒá and Rajoviƒá with new members, bassist Branislav Dragoviƒá (a former Samostalni Referenti member), guitarist Nenad Pejoviƒá (a former Headstream member), and guitarist Nikola Novakoviƒá, released the album Prekidi stvarnosti (Reality Cracks). The album, produced by the band themselves with Goran Matiƒá, featuring bonus tracks \\"Every Nation (Sunset Mix)\\" and \\"Ahead There\\" recorded in Los Angeles, was pronounced the best album of the year 2005 by the webzine Popboks.\\"IZBOR POPBOKSA ZA 2005 ‚Äì Domaƒái i strani album i koncert: Antony and The Johnsons, KKN i Mercury Rev\\", Popboks.com On early 2005, the band was joined by the trumpet player Zoran Erkman, also known as Zerkman, a former Disciplina Kiƒçme member.

Austrian representation in Canada The Austrian ambassador to the United States was accredited to Canada in 1952. An embassy was established in Ottawa in 1958. Twenty-first century Relations between Canada and Austria are growing, helped by the active international cooperation of both countries, their healthy trade and investment relations and increasing people- to-people ties, particularly through cultural and youth exchanges. Austria's membership in the European Union and its strong ties to the Central and South- Eastern European region make Austria a valuable interlocutor for Canada on a wide range of political, economic, trade, environmental and security issues with that region. Austria is also interested in the Canadian immigration and integration policy model, and there is considerable scope for bilateral discussion in this area. For example, in May 2007, senior officials from Austrian federal and municipal departments travelled to Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto, as part of a study tour focused on Canadian policies, practices and experiences with welcoming newcomers. Last year, the Vienna School Board sent a delegation to Toronto and Vancouver area school boards, to observe Canadian policies on language training and the integration of visible minorities into their education system. Canada and Austria share many common interests and similar perspectives on global issues and challenges. They cooperate in multilateral fora, and have been partners in promoting UN reform, arms control and disarmament initiatives, human rights, peacekeeping, and the Human Security Network. Austria's candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2009/2010 could provide another avenue for advancing our common multilateral interests. The Canadian Embassy in Vienna is the 2007/2008 NATO Contact Point Embassy (CPE) for Austria, which is a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace Programme. Essentially CPE's are allied embassies that serve as channels between NATO and partner countries by disseminating information and explaining NATO policies to the local government and population through a wide array of activities. Trade Austria took a strong position in opposition of a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the European Union and Canada. Culture Austria is a top destination for Canadian artists, performers and cultural industries. Canadian dance enjoys a great reputation and performances by Canada's best choreographers and troupes regularly sell out. Academic ties are close and growing; Austria boasts three Canadian Studies Centres at the Universities of Vienna, Innsbruck and Graz, and there are exchange programmes between Canadian and Austrian universities, as well as work-study opportunities geared for youth. Foreign Minister MacKay met Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik in February 2006. The last meeting of the Canadian Prime Minister and the Austrian Chancellor took place in 2020.

He is known for his gritty power soul vocals reminiscent of Bobby Womack. He has become an artist of public note through his 2008 independent release of the Soul and Gospel album Beyond Comprehension under the recording name of Freddie Lee. He made his prime time acting debut as \\"DJ Freddie Murphy\\" on Channel 4's T4 Stars & Strikes and as a character in BBC2's Grumpy Guide to Work in 2011. He was also the voice for Bewiser Owl in the Bewiser Insurance TV commercial in 2012 and 2013. He established himself in the live entertainment industry with his choreographed costume Soul Tribute stage productions for theatres and resorts in 1991. These critically acclaimed shows include The Sounds of the Four Tops, The Sounds of the Drifters and The Sounds of the Temptations. Freddie Lee Peterkin is also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Delta Psi chapter.. Peterkin was responsible for composing many Delta Psi Chapter fraternity anthems such as 'I Know I've Been Changed' written in 1985 while he was pledging. He was also a dancer and choreographer of the Delta Psi Chapter's 'Step Shows'. Stepping (African-American) or step- dancing is a form of percussive dance in which the participant's entire body is used as an instrument to produce complex rhythms and sounds through a mixture of footsteps, spoken word, and hand claps and a strong part of Black Greek Letter Fraternities. Peterkin is the son of migrant workers originally from Georgia who came to Florida to pick crops for a living. He is of African and Seminole Indian heritage. His stepfather, James Elijah Jr., was the lead vocalist of the 1960s and 1970s gospel group, The Royal Lights. His sister Breyona Elijah is part of the gospel group James Smith & Nu Birth and they are both cousins of Gospel group Damali. His mother Bernice Bell is also a singer and as a child won a competition to write a song for Joe Tex, for which she was awarded concert tickets and a chance to meet her idol. Joe Tex went on to have a major hit with the song but Bernice remained uncredited. Bernice Bell has been more recently recognized for her charity work and ran youth programs in Pahokee's Padgett Island Community Center for 17 years and donating hot meals to Pahokee's underprivileged children. The community center was recently renamed \\"The Bernice Bell Community Center\\".  Early life  Peterkin grew up in Padgett Island one of a number of housing projects in Pahokee, Florida, US. As a child he began working alongside his family picking beans and oranges to support the family income. Like most children in the area he also attended Pahokee Elementary and Pahokee High School. Whilst in school Freddie became part of the Pahokee marching band OD Express and also part of the New Hope Missionary Baptist Church Choir. He also formed a High School band called High Society featuring James Smith, Ronald 'Buttermilk' Banks and twins Barlow and Peewee Bouie. Freddie was an exceptional high school student and gained a scholarship to attend Florida Memorial University, a historical black college based in Miami, Florida. He graduated with a double degree in Airway Science, Business Management and minors in Sociology, Psychology and Education. Whilst attending Florida Memorial University, he pledged to his fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha. He also formed the Florida Memorial Gospel Choir with Benjamin Carroll. During this time Freddie was part of the Soul and Gospel group 'Message' and he opened up for artists such as Howard Hewett, Betty Wright, Vanessa Bell Armstrong and Shirley Caesar. He also worked with Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine, providing backing vocals on their studio recordings. From 1985 to 1991, he served as the assistant Pastor at Greater New Hope Missionary Baptist Church, Pahokee, FL. He was certified for ministering by Reverend W. Bouyer and Church Secretary Ms Mary Jackson and served under Rev. Bouyer and his successor Dr. Rev. Bass holding Sunday service every fourth Sunday. From 1987 to 1991 he also studied Expository Preaching and Exegetical Preaching under his mentor Elder Rev. Kenneth Duke at New Jerusalem Primitive Baptist Church, Miami Florida. Upon graduating, Freddie was a qualified counselor working at the Miami Psychological Evaluation Center and a school teacher for the County. A career change came with a contract to produce a soul show in Spain. He and his colleagues in his singing group Message left the United States for Europe. At this time Peterkin also left his ministerial career in the church.  Early career  After an initial audition in 1989, in which Peterkin and the other members of 'Message' had to perform several choreographed soul tribute performances, Freddie delayed leaving the United States. He left for Spain in 1991 and began a new life as an entertainer and show producer. He created one of the earliest known soul tribute shows in Europe. In 1993, Freddie renamed the group from 'Message' to 'Aces' and he was responsible for costumes and show production as well as sharing lead vocals in the show. He was based initially in Madrid and then in Gran Canaria, touring all the live music venues. Aces featured on television, billboards and buses. They also toured England, Germany, France, Italy and the rest of Spain. Aces relocated permanently to London, England in 1998 and were the first American Soul Tribute show to be seen in the UK. They began touring and working 300 shows a year in theatre, clubs, resorts and festivals. They appeared several times on Capital Gold Radio Roadshows. Freddie was responsible for both costume and choreography for the national theatre show \\"Reach Out\\" produced by Pete Tobit.  Homeless  It was in 2002 when Freddie found that one of his colleagues who had been appointed the group's business administrator has been stealing from their company account for a number of years. High tensions ensued, Freddie and the other group members were outraged enough to close down the group and they went their separate ways. The effects of this persons theft and the termination of their work contracts caused Peterkin and his other two colleagues to lose their homes. It was during this time that out of pride and refusal to ask others for help, that he took to sleeping in his car in roadside service stations whilst restarting both his life and career over again. He has stated in interviews that the one or two friends he confided in about his situation who had previously enjoyed his five star live style, turned their backs on him. He also could not face returning home to his family in the US having lost everything he had worked for. It was during this time that his inspiration for writing much of the album Beyond Comprehension took place.  Restarting his career  In early 2003, Peterkin was signed up under management of Jessie Tsang who gave him some contracts to work as a solo artist. He showcased as a solo artist for The Stage newspaper and won rave reviews for his performance in Showcall 2003. By 2004, Peterkin was back on his feet again and the show named the Sounds of The Four Tops, made its debut at the national Showcall Showcase 2004. During this time Peterkin found fame in the live industry of the UK through producing in Soul Tribute Production shows and was frequently reviewed by The Stage in the UK for his production shows the Sounds of The Four Tops and The Sounds of the Drifters and later the 2009 Sounds of the Temptations show. These production show began touring 200 dates per year in the UK and Europe.  Plagiarism of Peterkin's dramatic works  In 2009, Peterkin discovered that the colleague who had stolen from him and the other group members had taken his original stage production and misappropriated the works as his own and contracted Peterkin's original dramatic works to \\"The Magic of Motown Theatre Show\\". Three former employees falsely claimed in the Herald newspaper that they had choreographed Peterkin's stage production in \\"How Sweet It Is\\" another British theatre show. His former employees were aged between 12‚Äì14 years old when Peterkin then aged 23 ‚Äì 27 years old first created and performed the works to the public between 1989-1994. Peterkin has since taken legal action against both the show producer of \\"The Magic of Motown\\", his former colleague from his group 'Aces' and his former employees in \\"How Sweet It Is\\" via Leonard Lowy and Co Solicitors, former in house solicitor for Island Records. Both shows gave notice that they would desist from using Peterkin's works but did not do so until 2010. Peterkin stated in interviews that he intends to still take the matter to the High Court to be acknowledged for his works and to seek compensation for the illegal use of his works. Unaffected by the plagiarism, Freddie's production shows \\"The Sounds of The Four Tops\\" and \\"The Sounds of The Drifters\\" renowned for their dazzling signature choreography and costumes, continue to be the most heavily booked Soul Tribute Production Shows in the UK. These production shows enabled Freddie to independently finance the production and pressing of his first album Beyond Comprehension. The album went into production in early 2007 and was completed by the December of the same year. Beyond Comprehension The Beyond Comprehension album was Peterkin's first critically acclaimed solo recording that established him as a recording artist and songwriter on radio and in the music press. In August 2008 Peterkin flew a copy of Beyond Comprehension to be debut in the US by Radio DJ Dawn Brady on WSWN Sugar 900 Radio. Peterkin chose Sugar 900 Radio because he grew up working in the surrounding sugar cane fields and orange groves. This made Dawn Brady the first DJ on radio in the US to play material from Peterkin's debut album. Stellar Award winning radio station WMBM Radio became the next station to support the album, with DJs MJ Smith and Jerry 'the disciple' Sawyer, interviewing Peterkin on four occasions. Other radio stations such as WHQT, Hot 105FM have since followed suit. Chief Jimmie Brown interviewed Peterkin for the first time alongside Walter Clyde Orange of the Commodores on Hot 105FM in September 2008. The first Radio station in the UK to play the song 'Brighter Days' from the album 'Beyond Comprehension' was Mike Rimmer on BBC Radio West Midlands in August 2008. The album Beyond Comprehension was produced by music heavyweights Tony Bean and Colin Bassett at 5am Productions for 5am Records, Birmingham, UK. 5am have been noted for their work with UK soul star Lemar, and US stars Kelly Rowland, Usher, Tyrese and Justin Timberlake. The PR behind the album was Michael Grant, formerly a child reggae star in the group Musical Youth, and Jessie Tsang. Beyond Comprehension was initially distributed independently through CD Baby and iTunes and has gained popularity through British soul clubs and specialist soul music radio stations such as Solar Radio, Starpoint Radio and 209 Radio. Most recently he was interviewed on mainstream FM stations by Tony Roots on New Style Radio 98.7FM and by Joe Aldred on BBC WM 95.6FM. On 16 June 2009, Peterkin gave his first British television interview on the chat show Bright Talk on BEN Television, Sky TV channel 184. Following radio and club support by the UK's premier soul DJ's on November 23, 2009, the album was made available in independent UK music shops and hit the No.12 spot Solar Radio's album charts on December 14, 2009. Music from his album \\"Beyond Comprehension\\" has featured heavily on the Phil Driver Soul Unsigned radio show and the Gary Spence Soulchoonz radio show, giving Peterkin airplay in the UK, US, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands. Following this success Peterkin is featured in the January 2010 edition of Blues & Soul, speaking to noted UK R&B; writer Pete Lewis. Peterkin also appears in a 3-page feature in the February edition of Soul Survivors magazine in an interview with journalist and DJ Fitzroy Facey. Towards the end of 2010 Freddie was featured in a small role in the feature film 'How Not To Be a Loser' with Richard E. Grant. He also made a guest appearance in the BBC 2 comedy series 'Grumpy Guide to...' screened in 2011. Freddie also released his first music video for \\"The Great I Am\\" from the album \\"Beyond Comprehension\\" in January 2011. The video was directed by Gratian Dimech and James Heath of Razor Edge Productions. He is also currently writing and producing with 5am Productions, his first artist - Clifton End. In February 2011 Freddie played the role of a comedy character creation on T4 (Channel 4). This was followed by small roles in various feature films from 2011 to 2012. Music Three years after the release of his first album, Peterkin released his new single \\"Searching\\" on May 1, 2011. This single is the first release from his forthcoming second album, My Soul Intentions, distributed via iTunes, Amazon and Nokia Music. On October 24, 2011 he released the single \\"Book of Love\\". As of July 2012, he released the single \\"Lover is Forever\\" with a B side \\"Brighter Days\\" (remixed). Over the course of 2013 Peterkin wrote several compositions with David Lee Andrews. One of these compositions originally titled \\"If We Just Keep Holding On To Love\\" is performed by David Lee Andrews. The track has since been renamed \\"Hold On To Love\\". The method of collaboration was done via Andrews sending instrumental and vocal ideas via e-mail and Peterkin returning verses, choruses and hooks via video and mp3 demos. The final production of \\"Hold On\\" was completed by Tony Bean and Colin Basset of 5am Productions who had produced Beyond Comprehension. Released in June 2014 was the single \\"So Far Away\\" performed by Dutch Caribbean star Clifton End, written by Peterkin, Tony Bean and Ronald Banks. Once again the track is produced by Tony Bean and Colin Bassett of 5am Productions. Peterkin had written and recorded the original version song \\"So Far Away\\" over 20 years ago but had been looking for the right artist to convey the emotion of the song. \\"So Far Away\\" reached No. 2 on the Official UK Soul Chart as of August 2014. Freddie Lee Peterkin has been under the management of Jessie Tsang since 2003.  Return to the church  In 2012, Peterkin re-dedicated his life to Christ and returned to the Church ministry as a member of the clergy. In early 2014 he embarked upon a ministerial tour of churches across the state of Florida, preaching his first sermons in eight years and visiting other churches. He became ordained in December 2014. He is once again known as Minister Freddie Lee Peterkin. His online ministry currently reaches an audience of up to 20,000 people each month offering psychological counsel, and spiritual guidance. He is a certified minister, originally licensed by Reverend W. Bouyer and Church Secretary Ms Mary Jackson in 1985 and ordained in December 2014. Peterkin's style of ministering is described as Expository Preaching and Exegetical Preaching which he had studied in 1997 to 1991, under his mentor Elder Rev. Kenneth Duke at New Jerusalem Primitive Baptist Church, Miami Florida. He is also a certified teacher and psychological counselor licensed by the State of Florida in 1989.

The game is broadcast on FOX Sports Southeast. Location The game is held at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis. Annual attendance The record for attendance, 61,171, was set in 1997. Since the Jackson State-Tennessee State rivalry became a fixture in 1994, the average attendance for a Southern Heritage Classic game is 48,518. Eleven of those 22 games have drawn at least 50,000 fans. Both schools are roughly equidistant from Memphis, being located approximately 200 miles away. The 2001 game was moved from its originally scheduled date of September 15 to November 22 due to the events of the September 11 terrorist attacks, and attendance suffered as a result, drawing only 28,690. History Although the two teams played each other, the games were played at each team's home field on an alternating basis. That made it difficult for fans of the road team to travel en masse. TSU head coach Bill Thomas and JSU head coach W.C. Gorden discussed the possibility of playing annually at a neutral site in Memphis, which was roughly equidistant from both campuses. Doing so could benefit both schools by enhancing the rivalry and bringing in more dollars. Both schools have a large alumni base in the Memphis metro area. The Southern Heritage Classic was founded and has been produced by Fred Jones Jr.\\"The 2005 Ford HBCU Football Classics Guide ‚Äì The Southern Heritage Classic\\", Ebony (September 2005), p. 136 A Memphis entrepreneur and entertainment producer, Jones was tasked with organizing the game as officials from both schools weren't familiar enough with the Memphis area. The Classic part of the series between the two schools began in 1990, with Tennessee State winning 23‚Äì14. There have been two years in which Jackson State did not participate‚Äî1991 and 1993. Mississippi Valley State played Tennessee State in 1991, and Grambling State was TSU's foe in 1993. Tennessee State has played in every Southern Heritage Classic since the game's inception in 1990, and TSU owns a 16‚Äì11 record in the contest. The games have largely been close, hard- fought battles with three overtime games and 14 contests decided by a touchdown or less. The highest-scoring game was set in 2001, the game delayed by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when Tennessee State beat Jackson State, 64‚Äì33, for a combined 97 points. TSU quarterback Shannon Harris passed for 360 yards and a Southern Heritage Classic record seven touchdowns in that game. Between 1995‚Äì2007 (13 games), nine were decided by seven points or less. Tennessee State has dominated this rivalry of late, winning five in a row and 12 of the last 15 matchups. Halftime at the 2013 Southern Heritage Classic Nearly 50 players that participated in the Southern Heritage Classic have gone on to play in the NFL, including four first-round draft picks: Lester Holmes (JSU offensive lineman, drafted 19th by the Philadelphia Eagles in 1993), Sylvester Morris (JSU wide receiver, drafted 21st by the Kansas City Chiefs in 2000), Rashard Anderson (JSU defensive back, drafted 23rd by the Carolina Panthers in 2000) and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (TSU defensive back, drafted 18th by the Arizona Cardinals in 2008). The classic and several festivities affiliated with it annually generates approximately $21 million for the Memphis economy and $325,000 for each university. The game also features two of the most highly acclaimed show bands in the country, with JSU's Sonic Boom of the South and TSU's Aristocrat of Bands. They both give high-energy halftime performances that are as popular as the game itself. Also, the Southern Heritage Classic tailgating experience is a large draw and begins days before the game. Concerts and other events fill up the weekend calendar, drawing fans from all over the country. Past concerts have included headline stars such as Luther Vandross, The O'Jays, Gap Band, Gladys Knight and Usher. The 2020 game, scheduled for September 12, was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was led by Meldon Joerger and Attilio Salemme. International Trotskyism, 1929-1985: a documented analysis of the movement By Robert Jackson Alexander p.833 In mid-1937 the Joerger and Salemme group held initial discussions on fusing with the Marxist Policy Committee (which itself later joined the Revolutionary Workers League). These discussions failed.\\"Footnote for Historians\\" by Max Shachtman in New International, Vol.4 No.12, December 1938, pp.377-379, Later that year, in the lead-up to the founding of the Socialist Workers Party, and while Salemme and Joerger were still with the Trotskyists around James Cannon, a debate arose in American Trotskyism on the nature of the Soviet Union. Salemme and Joerger offered \\"the most damning alternative analyses that had yet been advanced within the ranks of the Trotskyist movement. The Salemme-Joerger document, entitled 'The U.S.S.R. and Stalinism', declared that the 'victory of Stalin in the party, the adoption of the theory of 'Socialism in One Country', the expulsion of the Left Opposition and the crushing of the workers' democracy and workers' control, signified that at the head of the U.S.S.R. there ruled a counter-revolutionary group which ruled in the interests of a new Russian bourgeoisie.'\\" The document went on to declare that the Soviet Union was \\"capitalist and fascist\\" and that revolutionaries must \\"stand for no 'material aid' to the Russian regime in time of war nor to its allies.\\" They also attacked Trotsky as a \\"juridical cretin\\" for insisting that nationalized property meant that Stalinist Russia remained a workers state. When the Socialist Workers Party was founded in January 1938 with a platform that still considered the Soviet Union to be a degenerated workers' state, Salemme immediately quit the party. Sometime thereafter the Revolutionary Marxist League was founded. The Revolutionary Marxist league's ideological position consisted of a rejection of both Stalinism and Trotskyism, which it regarded as an inverted form of Stalinism. It was equally harsh in its denunciation of the various splinters from official Trotskyism: > We cannot emphasize too much our position that we have nothing in common > with the Trotskyite brand of Stalinism or any other inverted form of > Stalinism. The various types of Trotskyites (Oehler, Field, Marlen, et al.) > ... The RML published a mimeographed organ called Revolutionary Action.

He served as Bishop of Syracuse from 1977 to 1987. Biography One of six children, Francis Harrison was born in Syracuse, New York, to Francis and Mary (n√©e Flynn) Harrison. He graduated from St. Lucy Academy, where he was class president and valedictorian, in 1929. He attended the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, where he played varsity baseball, before entering St. Bernard's Seminary in Rochester in 1931. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 4, 1937. During his priestly ministry, he served as assistant director of Utica Catholic Charities; curate at Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Utica, St. Mary of the Assumption in Binghamton, and the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Syracuse; and founding pastor of St. Andrew the Apostle in Syracuse, St. Patrick in Binghamton, and St. James in Syracuse. On March 1, 1971, Harrison was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Syracuse and Titular Bishop of Aquae in Numidia by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 22 from Bishop David Frederick Cunningham, with Bishops Stanislaus Joseph Brzana and Joseph Lloyd Hogan serving as co-consecrators. Following the resignation of Bishop Cunningham, Harrison was named the seventh Bishop of Syracuse on November 9, 1976. He was installed at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on February 6, 1977. He was the first native of Syracuse to head the diocese. Harrison practiced a collegial manner of governing, and worked to include laity and especially women in diocesan affairs. He launched diocesan programs for African Americans, Hispanic, Native Americans, and the disabled. He once played a game of golf with entertainer Bob Hope, who later recorded a radio ad for the diocese's first HOPE Appeal, an annual fundraiser Harrison started in 1978. In 1980 he called for the United States to cease its aid to El Salvador following the murder of three nuns, declaring, \\"As Christians and as Americans, we cannot condone our resources and our tax dollars being used to help any foreign government repress its own people so brutally.\\" He later expressed his opposition to military aid for Nicaragua. Shortly before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, Harrison resigned as bishop on June 16, 1987. He later died at St. Camillus Health and Rehabilitation Center, aged 91. He is buried at St. Agnes Cemetery in Syracuse.

Sethares (born April 19, 1955) is an American music theorist and professor of electrical engineering at the University of Wisconsin. In music, he has contributed to the theory of Dynamic Tonality and provided a formalization of consonance. Consonance and dissonance Among the earliest musical traditions, musical consonance was thought to arise in a quasi- mystical manner from ratios of small whole numbers. (For instance, Pythagoras made observations relating to this, and the ancient Chinese Guqin contains a dotted scale representing the harmonic series.) The source of these ratios, in the pattern of vibrations known as the harmonic series, was exposed by Joseph Sauveur the early 18th century and even more clearly by Helmholtz in the 1860s. In 1965, Plomp and Levelt showed that this relationship could be generalized beyond the harmonic series, although they did not elaborate in detail. In the 1990s, Sethares began exploring Plomp and Levelt's generalization, both mathematically and musically. His 1993 paper On the relationship between timbre and scale formalized the relationships between a tuning's notes and a timbre's partials that control sensory consonance. A more accessible version also appeared in Experimental Musical Instruments as \\"Relating Tuning and Timbre\\" These papers were followed by two CDs, Xenotonality and Exomusicology (some songs from which can be freely downloaded here), which explored the application of these ideas to musical composition. In his 1998 book Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale, Sethares developed these ideas further, using them to expose the intimate relationship between the tunings and timbres of Indonesian and Thai indigenous music, and to explore other novel combinations of related tunings and timbres. Where microtonal music was previously either dissonant (due to being played with harmonic timbres to which it was not \\"related\\"), or restricted to the narrow range of harmonically related tunings (to retain sensory consonance), Sethares's mathematical and musical work showed how musicians might explore microtonality without sacrificing sensory consonance. As one reviewer of the second edition of this book wrote, \\"Physics had built a prison round music, and Sethares set it free.\\" Another reviewer wrote that it \\"is not only the most important book about tuning written to date, but it is the most important book about music theory written in human history.\\" Dynamic tonality In 2003, Sethares began an informal collaboration with Andrew Milne and Jim Plamondon, whimsically called the Isomorphic Conspiracy. Its aim was to explore the musical relationships exposed by isomorphic keyboards, which are an unusual design of two-dimensional keyboards that have the intriguing characteristic of having transpositional invariance‚Äîthat is, \\"the same fingering in every key.\\" By early 2006, the Isomorphic Conspiracy had discovered that such keyboards also had the same fingering in every tuning, too‚Äîor, at least, every tuning of what the Conspiracy came to call the syntonic temperament. This consistency of fingering across tunings, which they called tuning invariance, enables a performer, using an isomorphic keyboard and compatible synthesizer (or software synthesizer), to play a given tonal piece in any of a wide range of tunings. The Conspiracy turned its attention to identifying the means by which different isomorphic keyboards could be compared, and identified the Wicki/Hayden keyboard as being optimal for the syntonic temperament's wide tuning range. In addition to being able to play in any fixed tuning with consistent fingering, the tuning invariance of isomorphic keyboards enables performers to change a piece's tuning on the fly, along the syntonic temperament's smooth tuning continuum, while retaining consonance (or, optionally, while introducing dissonance to any tonal structure). It soon became clear that this dynamic tonality offered an entirely novel means of controlling tension and release. To put these ideas into practice, Sethares (with collaborators and students) developed a freely available software-based synthesizer, the TransFormSynth, which enables a performer to bend tunings polyphonically during performance. In April 2008, Sethares used the TransFormSynth to compose and record the first musical piece that used dynamic tonality, which he called \\"C to Shining C\\" (although the piece, as recorded, is not actually in any musical key). A single chord is played throughout the piece, yet it gains a feeling of tension and release through its tuning progression from 19-tone equal temperament tuning to 5-tone equal temperament tuning and back, complemented by a slower timbre progression from a fully harmonic timbre to a fully tuning-aligned timbre. In 2009, Sethares led the Isomorphic Conspiracy's extension of Dynamic tonality to include a wider variety of tunings, including *Equal tunings, such as 12-tone equal temperament (abbreviated \\"12-tet\\"), 19-tet, and 31-tet; *Non-equal tunings such as 1/4-comma meantone and Pythagorean tuning; *Irregular tunings such as circulating or \\"well\\" temperaments; and *Closely related rank-2 Just Intonation tunings, All of these different tunings can be controlled with identical fingering and full consonance using a dynamic-tonality-capable synthesizer such as the TransFormSynth and an isomorphic keyboard. (The TransFormSynth maps the Wicki/Hayden note-layout to the standard QWERTY keyboard, so that no special keyboard is necessary.)

Three lines with a total of 33 stations were planned to be built by 2021, however in the late 1980s, during the Singing Revolution, the whole project met with opposition and combined with the fall of the Soviet Union, construction, which was planned to begin in 1990, never took place. The population of the city has been declining due to emigration and negative population growth rate since 1990, making the prospects of a full metro system, even with EU funding, unrealistic in the near future. In fact, after the fall of the Soviet Union, possible construction of the metro system has seldom been publicly discussed, even dismissed as unnecessary. History Axonometrical plan of placing of Uzvaras station, 1981 The idea of the Riga Metro emerged in the mid 1970s, when city planners were examining how to integrate traffic systems into the capital. Several concepts were proposed, including the reconstruction of the city's railway or the installation of high-speed tram lines. However, officials regarded both proposals as inefficient. The most pressing issue was that Riga's population was rising quickly and was expected to eventually surpass one million, the requirement for constructing a metro in the Soviet Union. The Metrogiprotrans institute in Moscow was to design the layout of the metro system, work out the economic planning, and develop the detailed design of the project itself. The technical and economic basis of the project was to be completed by 1978. Another three years were scheduled for further elaboration of the project, with another nine years for the construction of the first eight metro stations. According to this plan, the first underground line was supposed to be opened in 1990. However, the development process faced continued delays, resulting in the technical and economic planning of the project being finished two years late, in 1980. A further five-year delay followed, stalling construction work of the metro line and stations, which could not begin before the all preparation work was finished. Due to hard geological condition of soils the design of the first section in 1984 was redirected to the Lenmetroproekt institute in Leningrad, who were more experienced in these conditions (Leningrad having similar geology). This resulted in the opening date of Riga metro being rescheduled to 1997 at the earliest. Art-decor design of interior of stations was given to local architects that had an experience already after a development of Rizhskaya station of Moscow Metro. In 1986 the plan-general of metro system was updated to include three lines instead of two. Despite continued delays, the project phase of the first section was completed in 1989, its preparation for build phase started at 1986 while a construction phase would to be in 1990, and the opening date planned for 2000‚Äì2002. At the end of the 1980s, the project began to receive strong criticism, and, as a result of public dissatisfaction combined with the fall of the Soviet Union, the planned construction during the 1990s never began.

It was estimated that the cost of one kilometre would be 25‚Äì26 million rubles. At the time the Riga metro was being planned, the metro in Minsk, Belarus was being built at a cost of 15 million rubles per kilometre. Officials in Riga were not very concerned with funding, as the necessary money would come mainly from Moscow. The budget of the Latvian SSR would have been responsible for funding the train depot (10‚Äì12 million rubles), engineering details (2.5 million rubles), and station vestibules (4‚Äì5 million rubles). As a result, Riga would have been expected to spend less than 20 million rubles for the city's metro. However, the city would have had competition for funding from Moscow, as Odessa and Omsk were also eager for financial assistance in establishing their own metro systems at the same time. Criticism Objections against the Riga metro began to be raised as the final design proposal was being finalised. The most pressing concerns, raised by the local scientific community, regarded the usefulness and effectiveness of such a massive and challenging project. They argued that the project would bring more harm than benefits to the city, as the ground waters in Riga are very high with migrating currents, and, as a result, nobody could tell where they would be after a decade. If ground waters were to flow across metro lines, the metro system would get flooded. However, this same argument did not prevent the construction of a metro in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), which has similar geological features to Riga. As perestroika began to become established in the Soviet Union, the local press became filled with geologic and geodesic articles and how these issues could affect a potential metro in the city. In addition to concerns about potential flooding, the project's authors were also blamed for having planned stations at inconvenient locations, and that the idea itself of a metro was becoming outmoded. After these arguments were evaluated and dismissed, nationalist elements within Latvia began protesting against another likely wave of migration of Slavs into Riga, which was said to pose a threat to the identity of Latvia and the Latvian language. Cancellation The end of the 1980s brought about disputes and doubts regarding the decisions of the Riga and Latvian governments concerning the metro, as well as the competence of specialists from Moscow. In 1987, ecological activists organised an act of protest; despite the protest, however, the decision was made to start work on the second stage of technological and economic planning. However, local specialists were asked to take over much of the work to reduce Latvia's reliance on specialists from Moscow. After two months, the planning commission came to the conclusion that there was no economic or technological basis to continue the project, and twelve years of planning ended without any work actually done.

She was sold as a two-year-old in training at the Ocala Breeders' Sale in March 2000 to Joseph F. Graffeo. That fall, she raced in three stakes races all in New York. In her first graded stakes race, she placed second in the grade two Adirondack Stakes at Saratoga Race Course at six and one half furlongs in late August. She then won the grade three Tempted Stakes at one mile at Aqueduct Racetrack in early October. In November, Two Item Limit won the grade two Demoiselle Stakes at Aqueduct run over the dirt at one mile. Three-year-old season At age three, Two Item Limit traveled cross country to run in the grade one Las Virgenes Stakes at one mile at Santa Anita Park in March and finished second. She then traveled back 3,000 miles back to her home base at Aqueduct Racetrack and won the grade two Comely Stakes at one mile in mid-April. Her connections then entered her in the second jewel of America's de facto Filly Triple Crown, the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. Two Item Limit was the third choice at 3-1 on the morning line in a strong field of five other stakes winners. She was vanned from Belmont Park to Pimlico Race Course in the early hours of the morning of the race and won the 77th running of the Grade II $250,000 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes in a time of 1:50 for the 1 1/8-mile distance. The fractions were :23, :47, 1:12 and 1:38. Later that year, Two Item Limit ran in the grade one Gazelle Handicap at nine furlongs, placing second, and the grade one Alabama Stakes at one mile and a quarter at Saratoga Race Course, where she placed third. She also ran in the Breeders' Cup Distaff (now the Ladies Classic) at one and one eighth mile in late October 2000. Four-year-old season At age four, Two Item limit ran a third in the grade one Ogden Phipps Handicap at 8 1/2 furlongs. She followed that effort up with an identical third-place finish in the $1,000,000 Delaware Handicap at one mile and a quarter at Delaware Park. Retirement In January 2003, Two Item Limit was retired and sent to Three Chimneys Farm to breed. In January 2008, she was sold at Keeneland Auction for $525,000.

The family left their property in Mortagne-au-Perche and moved to Vendargues in the H√©rault where they managed an estate producing wine. Le Roy studied law. On 9 June 1907 during the revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers Le Roy set fire to the door of the courthouse of Montpellier to prevent the troops who had been confined inside from shooting at the demonstrators. Pierre Leroy de Boiseaumarie began his mandatory military service on 10 October 1911. He began service as an infantryman, was transferred to artillery. On 21 February 1916, he began pilot training. He graduated with his Military Pilot's Brevet on 2 August 1916. After advanced training, he was posted to a fighter squadron, Escadrille N.78, on 19 February 1917. There he was promoted from the enlisted ranks to the rank of Sous lieutenant. While with this fighter squadron, he shot down two observation balloons and three enemy airplanes His fifth victory came on 7 June 1918; that same day, he was so seriously wounded that he had to be medically evacuated. On 17 August, he returned to his squadron; he was subsequently posted to Escadrille Spa.15.

A series of technical examinations from 1993 onwards confirmed the attribution. It is thought to date from c.1670 and is now in part of the Leiden Collection in New York. It should not be confused with Young Woman Seated at a Virginal in the National Gallery, London, also by Vermeer. Provenance and attribution The painting's early provenance is unclear, though possibly it was owned in Vermeer's lifetime by Pieter van Ruijven and later inherited by Jacob Dissius. By 1904 it was one of two Vermeers owned by Alfred Beit, the other being Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid. It remained in the Beit family until sold to Baron Rolin in 1960. The painting was not widely known until described in the catalogue of the Beit collection published in 1904. In the first decades following 1904 it was widely accepted as a Vermeer. Then in the mid-twentieth century, as some \\"Vermeers\\" were discovered to be forgeries by Han van Meegeren and doubt was cast on others, it fell from favour. In 1993 Baron Rolin asked Sotheby's to conduct research into the painting. A series of technical examinations followed, which have convinced most experts that it is a Vermeer, though probably one that was reworked in parts after the painter's death. Rolin's heirs sold the painting through Sotheby's in 2004 to Steve Wynn for $30 million. It was later purchased for the Leiden Collection owned by Thomas Kaplan. It has appeared in several Vermeer exhibitions in recent years, in the United States, Britain, Japan, Italy and France. Description and evidence for attribution The painting originally had the same dimensions as Vermeer's Lacemaker. Tentative evidence that the canvas was cut from the same bolt as the Lacemaker, which was gathered in the 1990s, was strengthened by a later, more sophisticated study. The ground appears identical to that used for the two Vermeers owned by London's National Gallery. X-ray examination has revealed evidence of a pin-hole at the vanishing point, as habitually used by Vermeer in conjunction with a thread to achieve correct perspective in his paintings. Pigments are used in the painting in a way typical of Vermeer, most notably the expensive ultramarine as a component in the background wall. The use of green earth in shadows is also distinctive. The use of lead-tin-yellow suggests that the painting cannot be a nineteenth- or twentieth-century fake or imitation. Examination of the cloak, often cited as the crudest part of the painting, shows that it was painted over another garment after some time had elapsed. It is not known how long this gap was, or if Vermeer was responsible for the repainting. The hairstyle can be dated to c.1670, and matches the hairstyle in the Lacemaker, which on other grounds is also often dated to the same period. It is not clear if the painting was completed before or after the similar but more ambitious Young Woman Seated at a Virginal in the National Gallery, London. The painting is unsigned. Criticism and interpretation Walter Liedtke has described the painting as a \\"minor late work\\" by Vermeer. The colour scheme is typical of Vermeer's mature work. The \\"luminosity and finely modelled passages\\" of the young woman's skirt recall the Lady Standing at a Virginal and are often cited as the painting's best feature, contrasting with the less skillfully painted cloak which may be the work of a later artist. The blurring of objects in the foreground, the quality of the light and the attention paid to the texture of the wall are typical of Vermeer, while the handling of the pearls in the woman's hair recalls the threads spilling from the cushion in the Lacemaker.

New Zealand career Although largely self-taught as a keyboard player, arranger and composer,debbiekruger.com ‚Äì APRAP ‚Äì Mike Perjanik Perjanik's skills soon made him a prominent figure on the thriving New Zealand music scene of the mid-1960s. After moving to Auckland in 1963 he joined local group The Embers and encouraged his friend Doug Jerebine to follow him; Jerebine eventually joined Perjanik in The Embers after a short stint in the popular band The Keil Isles. Perjanik began writing music and his songs were recorded by New Zealand pop singers such as Dinah Lee; he also arranged music for Ray Columbus and toured with visiting international performers like Gene Pitney. One of the Perjanik Group's first sessions was backing a new singing duo discovered by Viking Records boss Ron Dalton; the duo, Sue and Judy Donaldson (who were childhood friends of La De Das guitarist Kevin Borich) were renamed by Perjanik as The Chicks; The Mike Perjanik Group backed them on their debut single \\"Heart of Stone\\"/\\"I Want You To Be My Boy\\" and in 1966 they also backed The Chicks on their single \\"The Rebel Kind\\". Perjanik discovered another talented female singer while he was playing at a hotel. Impressed by her powerful voice Perjanik informed Ron Dalton of his discovery and she was soon brought to the Viking studio to record \\"Tumblin' Down\\", which was released under the singer's new stage name Maria Dallas. Perjanik helped launch the career of vocalist Allison Durbin. They first worked together when Durbin was backed by Perjanik's band in the studio and they subsequently began a relationship. Durbin was soon performing as the band's featured singer and in October 1966. After nine months with the band, Durbin left to pursue a solo career; she subsequently scored several hit singles in Australia, was named as Australia's \\"Queen of Pop\\" and became a prominent recording and TV performer in the 1970s. Australian career Settling permanently in Australia, Perjanik established himself as a sought-after record producer.

Founded in 1873 by Henry Griffith Keasbey (1850-1932) and Richard Van Zeelust Mattison (1851-1935), the company moved to Ambler, Pennsylvania, in 1881. By World War I, the Keasbey and Mattison Company's presence caused Ambler to be known as the \\"asbestos capital of the world\\". Keasbey and Mattison was purchased by Turner & Newall in 1934. History Lindenwold Castle, home of Richard Mattison Keasbey and Mattison Company Houses, Ambler The Keasbey & Mattison Company, Ambler, PA The Keasbey and Mattison Company was founded in 1873 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by Henry G. Keasbey, a businessman, and Dr. Richard V. Mattison, a chemist/pharmacist. The company originally manufactured and marketed patent medicines. Working in a company laboratory, Mattison discovered that a mixture of magnesium carbonate and asbestos would adhere to a hot metal pipe, and could be turned into an insulation material for steam pipes. Asbestos and related building products soon became the focus of the company. Mattison moved the company from Philadelphia to Ambler, Pennsylvania, in 1881. Ambler's location along the railroad line was a primary consideration in the location of Keasbey and Mattison Company in Ambler, as it meant that asbestos could be easily brought in from Quebec, and products sent out. Another consideration was the availability of magnesium carbonate, which could be locally mined. The original K&M; factory was built as of 1883, conveniently placed near the railroad. When Keasbey and Mattison relocated, the town consisted of \\"70 houses, 250 residents, a drug store, general store and a few other businesses.\\" Keasbey and Mattison became the dominant employer of the town of Ambler and had a major impact on it. Mattison built homes for the company's workers and executives. He founded a library and built an opera house, offices, shops, and Trinity Memorial Episcopal Church. He owned the Ambler Water Co. and the Ambler Electric Light, Heat & Motor Co. He also ensured that Ambler was incorporated as a borough. Mattison brought in stone masons from Southern Italy to work on his estate, modifying an existing Victorian structure in homage to Windsor Castle and naming it Lindenwold Castle. German craftsmen were imported to work on the iron gates. By 1892, Henry Keasbey retired from active involvement in the company. Under Mattison's direction, the company expanded, purchasing the Bell mine in Thetford Mines, Quebec, Canada in 1906 and another mine at Bear Canyon, Arizona in 1928. Bell Mines excavated and milled raw Chrysotile asbestos, using the open-cut method. Asbestos was then shipped by railway to Ambler, where it was processed and used to create a wide variety of products. Keasbey and Mattison did extensive research and product development. By 1896, the plant included areas to produce roofing tiles, papers, pipe coverings, and the nation's first asbestos textile plant. By 1897, they were producing asbestos paper and millboard for electrical insulation and welding shields. As of 1905, they began to use the Hatschek process for manufacturing asbestos cement roofing shingles, which they sold under the name \\"Century Asbestos Slate\\". They even released advertising postcards, showing elegant buildings that used the new materials. By 1906, they were treating lumber with asbestos. By 1909, they were making asbestos brake linings for automobiles and railway trains. In a 1920 report, the Pennsylvania Department of Health noted that the Ambler plant employed 900 men and used 1,000,000 gallons of Wissahickon Creek water daily. The plant was applauded for its \\"admirable scheme\\" of color-coding all water pipes, to distinguish between creek water (blue) and drinkable water (yellow). The company also had a first aid room with a doctor in attendance at all times. However, the amount of waste released downstream was \\"tremendous\\" and gave the creek \\"a milky appearance\\". Little or nothing was known about the dangers of asbestos when the plant was built. By modern standards working conditions at the plant were hazardous, as workers came into daily contact with the mineral. Raw asbestos fibers were stirred into cement slurries or beaten by hand and fed into carding machines. Ventilation was rarely used in the rooms, and the men working in the plant did not wear ventilator masks. In 1921 the company bought the historical Hope Lodge property from Mary Wentz for $40,000. Their test excavations showed that there was limestone on the site, and they apparently considered extending an already functioning limestone quarry. However, in 1922, they sold the property to William and Alice Degn. With the onset of the Great Depression, Mattison found himself overextended, and in 1931 the company was taken over by bankers. In 1934, the Keasbey and Mattison Company was sold to English company Turner & Newall, but retained its own name. T&N; operated the plant until 1962, and had \\"100 percent control over decision making on policy matters\\". In 1962, the property was purchased by CertainTeed Corporation and Nicolet Industries and divided in two. Both companies produced asbestos products and auto parts at the location. The Turner & Newall company was acquired by Federal-Mogul in 1998. Federal-Mogul eventually filed for Chapter 11 protection as a result of asbestos claims. In 2013, Heckendorn Shiles Architects and Summit Realty Advisers successfully converted the original \\"Boiler House\\" portion of the Keasbey & Mattison factory in Ambler. This derelict factory and smokestack of the Keasbey & Mattison company was converted into a LEED Platinum Certified multi-tenant office building, the Ambler Boiler House. The adaptive reuse project won support from the EPA‚Äôs Brownfields Program and the EnergyWorks program. The renovations cost $16 million, and have resulted in a building with substantial green features including a grey-water system, geothermal energy, solar panels and a reflective roof system, and high-efficiency glass.

It was fought on September 27, 1861 between settlers of Pinos Altos mining town, the Confederate Arizona Guards, and Apache warriors. The town is located about seven miles north of the present day Silver City, New Mexico. Background The conflict between the Confederates and Apaches was at its height in September 1861. Since the 1860 discovery of gold in the nearby Pinos Altos Mountains, thousands of white settlers had flocked to the region. This infuriated the Apache Chiefs Mangas Coloradas and after the Bascom Affair, Cochise, who by 1861 had formed an alliance with each other and vowed to destroy all of the Americans and Mexicans encroaching on their land. Apaches attacked several towns, killing many settlers. Pinos Altos, being one of the major mining towns in the area, formed its own two militia companies for garrison duty. The first company under Captain Thomas J. Mastin called themselves the \\"Arizona Guards\\", the other under Captain William Markt, called themselves the \\"Minute Men\\". The founder of Phoenix, Jack Swilling was a First Lieutenant of the Arizona Guards, he is believed to have fought in the Pinos Altos engagement. One of the soldiers of the company engaged was James Henry Tevis. Most of the Arizona Guards were settlers and miners from around Pinos Altos and the Mimbres River valley or other parts of southern New Mexico Territory who had joined to protect their lives and property due to the escalating conflict with the Mimbre√±os. When the provisional Arizona Territory was annexed to the Confederacy after Lt. Colonel John Baylor occupied Mesilla in July 1861, the Militia companies were mustered into the Confederate Army. Unfortunately for the rebels, half of the Minute Men deserted just after their induction, the others were poorly equipped. This meant the Arizona Guards had to provide most of the protection for the Pinos Altos miners. Battle The combined force of Mangas Coloradas and Cochise numbered well over 300 strong when they turned their attention to Pinos Altos in the early morning of September 27, 1861. The Apaches hoped to achieve another victory as they had had at Tubac and had attempted at Placito. The natives attacked simultaneously the nearby mining camp and the town itself. The assault completely surprised the town's population. Many miners, at their camp, were trapped in their diggings and subsequently killed. Some survivors stayed underground, too afraid to venture out, thus contributing nothing to the town's defense. Two forces of the Arizona Guards were on patrol when the Apaches attacked; Mastin commanded one while the other portion patrolled elsewhere. Apache forces first attempted to burn several log cabins which ran along the perimeter of the settlement: this failed, and the natives were repulsed. Fortunately for the miners, Mastin's squad of fifteen men arrived back at the town not long after hostilities began, while the other portion was still on patrol. Mastin ordered his men, the remnants of the Minute Men, and the town's civilian defenders to take up defensive positions in the center of the settlement. For a while the two sides fought at medium to long range until the Apaches launched a full attack at about 12:00 noon, leading to hand to hand combat. When the battle at its climax around 12:30 pm, Captain Mastin realized something must be done to aid his overwhelmed militiamen. So he ordered the old cannon, which sat in front of the famous Sam and Roy Bean's store, to be loaded with rusty nails and buckshot; there were no cannonballs, as the cannon was only there for show. The gun was wheeled into the defenders' position and fired on the wave of oncoming Apache warriors, and many fell, dead or wounded. The Apaches decided to cease their effort and began to retreat. The Arizona Guards mounted their horses and gave chase, and civilians fired muskets from their house windows. The engagement was over by 1:00 pm, and the Apaches fled to the Gila River or to Mexico. Aftermath Map of the traditional boundaries of Arizona and the later Confederate Arizona south of the 34 parallel. Within the last half hour of the battle, Captain Thomas Mastin managed to turn an almost certain defeat into victory with his simple order to bring up the old cannon. At least ten Apaches were killed and left on the battlefield after the natives had retreated. Over twenty dead and wounded were picked up and dragged away by the Apaches, according to Confederate accounts. Captain Mastin was mortally wounded, sometime while leading the cavalry charge that decided the battle, he died a few days later at Pinos Altos. Other accounts say Mastin was killed by an Apache bullet, before the cannon was ever in use. Five Confederates were killed, including Mastin, seven other settlers or militiamen were severely wounded. Command of the Arizona guards passed to Lieutenant Thomas Helm. Apache tactics changed at this point, other than at the Apache Pass engagement, Apaches ceased massing in large numbers and continued their cause by means of guerilla warfare. They stopped attacking well defended settlements, or settlements with large bodies of Confederate troops. Instead they continued attacking mining camps and smaller isolated communities. Captain Peter Hardeman of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles with twenty-five men were near Pinos Altos immediately after the Apaches retreated. Hardeman's troop came across the Apache trail and tracked them for days, all the way to the Gila River before turning back due to their rations which were running low. Confederate forces chased Apaches into Mexico several times in 1861 and 1862. The Arizona Guards penetrated as far as Lake Guzman in Chihuahua, without ever catching the elusive natives. As for Pinos Altos, most of the settlers ended their stay at the camp. Despite their victory, many were afraid the Chiricahua would attack again. On October 8, Governor Baylor received a distress message from the miners of Pinos Altos so 100 men were sent to reinforce the Arizona Guards, the largest Confederate force ever sent to relieve a town threatened by natives. The Apaches never attacked again so the reinforcing company was withdrawn. Only about seventy miners remained in Pinos Altos after the battle, the Arizona Guards continued their garrison duty.

(alternatively titled Stoned Bros) is an Aboriginal Australian stoner comedy film directed by Richard Frankland. It was theatrically released in Australia on 24 September 2009. Plot Eddie (Carroll) is working as a cleaner in a museum in Perth, Western Australia, but loses his job because of an accident that sees a series of cardboard cutout images of Australia's Prime Ministers fall down in a domino effect, resulting in an image of John Howard landing on and killing his boss's cat. When his cousin Charlie (Burchill) trades away Eddie's favourite jacket, he unwittingly loses a sacred stone, entrusted to Eddie by his uncle, which he promised to one day return to its home in Kalgoorlie. This is the final straw, as far as Eddie is concerned, and he sets off to recover the stone and reconnect with his aboriginal roots. Charlie, escaping the wrath of his vengeful girlfriend, forces himself along for the ride, and Eddie's spiritual journey takes a very sharp turn off-track. Along the way, they pick up what Charlie mistakes for a \\"hot chick\\" only to find they are landed with Vinnie (del Torro), a self-described Italian rock star. Soon after they are joined by Eddie and Charlie's transgender cousin Regina (Page), who dreams of making it big on the Koori edition of Australian Idol, and a confused European Australian cop (Phelps) who dreams of going walkabout. Cast * Luke Carroll as Eddie * Leon Burchill as Charlie * Valentino del Toro as Vinnie (Italian Stallion) * Peter Phelps as Mark (Prison Guard) * David Page as Regina * Luke Hewitt as Barry * Rohanna Angus as Rhonda * Jai Courtney as Eric * Sarah Rachael Olivia Lawrence as Elizabeth Production The film is widely regarded as the first feature length Aboriginal Australian comedy film. When asked why there were so few Aboriginal comedies, director Richard Frankland stated that: Box office The film was released in Australian cinemas on 24 September 2009 and grossed $24,992 on its opening week in the Australia cinemas. The film ultimately grossed $99,032, making it the 235th highest-grossing film in Australia for 2009. Director Richard Frankland had originally hoped that teenagers would form a large part of the viewing audience for Stone Bros., however the film received an MA15+ rating, preventing this age group from seeing it at the cinema. This rating was supposedly given due to a deleted scene that involved marijuana buds being cut from a plant.

Biography Lupton was the only surviving son of Charles Lupton , solicitor and co-founder of the law firm DLA Piper, alderman, and Lord Mayor of Leeds 1915‚Äì16, and his wife Katharine, of Carr Head, Roundhay. His mother was the fourth daughter of Thomas Ashton, , of Ford Bank, Didsbury, Manchester, two of whose sons were Thomas Gair Ashton MP, who became Lord Ashton of Hyde, and Samuel Edgar Ashton. Lupton was educated at Hillbrow and Rugby Schools, leaving the latter in July 1916, before he was 18, to join the Royal Naval Air Service. He was commissioned as a temporary flight sub-lieutenant on 20 July 1916, and was granted Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 3734, flying a Maurice Farman biplane at RNAS Eastbourne, on 14 September 1916. He first served at home stations, and at Prawle Point in April 1917 he met with a serious accident which incapacitated him for two months. He was sent to Dunkirk in August 1917, when posted to No. 5 (Naval) Squadron flying the Airco DH.4 two- seater day bomber. Lupton gained his first victory on 28 September, driving down out of control an Albatros D.V over Blankenberge, and repeated the feat on 8 December over Aertrycke airfield. His crewman for both was Aerial Gun Layer Smith, and the second victory was shared with Flight Sub-Lieutenant John Gamon and AGL Winter. On 18 December 1917 he and two other officers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for their part in an bombing raid. The citation read: :Flight Sub-Lieutenant Charles Roger Lupton, RNAS. :Flight Sub- Lieutenant Euan Dickson, RNAS. :Observer Sub-Lieutenant William Lawrence Hill, RNAS. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in a bombing raid on Thourout Railway Station and Varsennaere Aerodrome on 25 October 1917. These officers volunteered for the expedition in spite of extremely unfavourable weather conditions. They have all previously taken part in many bombing raids.\\" Lupton was promoted to flight lieutenant on 31 December 1917, and was appointed an acting flight commander in January 1918. In March his squadron moved further south, and on the 22nd of that month Lupton, now flying with AGL A. G. Wood, drove down another Albatros D.V south-west of Vendhuile. He was awarded a second Distinguished Service Cross, which was gazetted posthumously on 4 June 1918. His citation read: :Flight Lieutenant (Acting Flight Commander) Charles Roger Lupton, DSC, RNAS. ::\\"For conspicuous bravery and skill in leading bombing formations, especially on 26 March 1918, when he carried out at low altitudes four bombing raids on enemy communications. In the course of these raids he caused great damage to enemy transport, and inflicted serious casualties on large numbers of their reinforcements. He has carried out very many bombing raids, and by his courage and resource has instilled a spirit of confidence and daring in all those who have flown with him.\\" When the Royal Naval Air Service and the Army's Royal Flying Corps were merged to form the Royal Air Force on 1 April, Lupton was promoted to captain, and No. 5 (Naval) Squadron became No. 205 Squadron RAF. A week later, on 6 April 1918, he sent a Fokker Dr.I down in flames north-east of Villers- Bretonneux, and the following day drove down a Pfalz D.III over Lamotte. Lupton was killed in action, after colliding with a French aircraft at an altitude of , while returning from a raid over the German lines, on 9 May 1918. He was 20 years old.

The lake is named for a fisherman who was brought there many times by bush pilot Don Sheldon in the 1950s. It is accessible from the George Parks Highway and has a developed campground, several public-use cabins and a small boat dock. The Alaska Veterans Memorial is on a hilltop adjacent to the lake. Gasoline-powered motors and floatplane landings are not permitted on the lake. The lake used to contain a sizable population of lake trout but due to overfishing in the time since the highway was built in 1972 the population has dwindled, and landings of lake trout are now rare, although there are still burbot in the lake as well. Migrating salmon also come into the lake but salmon fishing is not permitted. Campers are advised to keep a clean camp as the campground is frequently visited by bears. The lake is also home in summer months to trumpeter swans and common loons. The Cascade Trail to Kesugi Ridge climbs above Byers Lake, with the Alaska Range and Denali in the background.

Biography Family background MacLean was born in Ealing, London, the son of Loudoun Francis MacLean (1848‚Äì1897), who died in Delhi, India, while serving as superintending engineer of the Jumna Canal. World War I After training as a \\"Gentlemen Cadet\\" at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, MacLean was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Royal Engineers on 1 April 1914. He was promoted to lieutenant on 9 June 1915, and served on the Western Front in France, winning the Military Cross, which was gazetted on 2 October. His citation read: :Lieutenant Loudoun James MacLean, 57th Field Company, Royal Engineers. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and determination during the nights of 25th to 31st August 1915, when he skilfully erected a bridge over the Yser Canal near Boesinghe under heavy rifle fire. Although he lost several of his men, he carried the work through satisfactorily.\\" MacLean was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, and after completing flying training, was appointed a flying officer on 5 May 1917. In June he was posted to No. 41 Squadron RFC, which was the last RFC squadron flying the obsolete F.E.8 fighter. These were replaced with the Airco DH.5 in July, but these also proved unsatisfactory, and in October they were replaced by the S.E.5a single-seat fighter. MacLean was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain on 24 October, and promoted to captain in the Royal Engineers on 3 November. He gained his first aerial victory on 29 November, when he and Lieutenants Russell Winnicott, D. V. D. MacGregor, and Essell, shared in the driving down out of control of an Albatros D.V over Douai. The following day, 30 November, MacLean shared in the destruction of two more enemy aircraft; an Albatros D.V over Inchy-en-Artois with Lieutenant D. V. D MacGregor, and a Type C reconnaissance aircraft over Rumilly with Captain Meredith Thomas, and Lieutenants Russell Winnicott and Frank H. Taylor. On 9 January 1918 he shared in the driving down of a Rumpler C east of Marcoing with Second Lieutenants A. T. Isbell and Alfred Hemming, and on 3 February another Type C driven down north-west of Douai shared with Second Lieutenant G. A. Lippsett. MacLean was awarded a bar to his Military Cross on 6 February 1918, which was gazetted on 2 July. His citation read: :Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) Loudoun James MacLean, MC, Royal Engineers and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. While leading a patrol he attacked and drove down an enemy two-seater machine and destroyed an enemy scout. He showed the greatest determination in leading patrols and splendid coolness and courage, most of his work being done under very difficult weather conditions.\\" Post- war career MacLean stayed in the RAF post-war, being granted a permanent commission with the rank of captain on 1 August 1919, and resigned his commission in the Royal Engineers the same day. He served in Iraq, in the Central Air Communication Section, before being transferred to the headquarters of RAF Iraq Command on 1 April 1922, finally returning to England when posted to the RAF Depot (Inland Area) as a supernumerary on 24 January 1923. From there he was posted to the Superintendent of Reserves, based at RAF Northolt on 24 August, then to the RAF Cadet College at RAF Cranwell on 24 October. On 15 September 1924 MacLean was posted to the Inland Area Aircraft Depot, RAF Henlow. On 1 January 1927 MacLean was promoted from flight lieutenant to squadron leader. He was posted to the RAF Depot at RAF Uxbridge on 15 July 1929, then to the No. 1 School of Technical Training, for engineer duties in No. 1 (Apprentices) Wing, at RAF Halton on 10 November. He left Halton on 2 March 1934, and on the 14th was posted to the Home Aircraft Depot at RAF Henlow, serving there until 3 September. He then served on the Central Trade Test Board at the Reception Depot at RAF West Drayton until 16 March 1935. Finally, on 1 April 1935 Maclean was placed on the retired list on account of his ill-health. However he returned to service during the Second World War, being commissioned as a temporary lieutenant-commander (A) in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm on 31 August 1939.

This is especially important for master key systems with many users. A system of key control includes strategies for keeping track of which keys are carried by which people, as well as strategies to prevent people from giving away copies of the keys to unauthorized users. The former may be as simple as assigning someone the job of keeping an up-to- date list on paper. A more complex system may require signatures and/or a monetary deposit. Levels Preventing unauthorized copies typically falls into one of the following five levels. * Level 5 (lowest): ordinary unrestricted keys. This level relies on the honor system. Users are instructed not to make copies or loan keys and trusted to comply. This is common for private residences. * Level 4 (low): unrestricted keys marked \\"Do Not Duplicate\\". These keys can theoretically be copied anywhere, but many stores will refuse to copy them. This is a very low-level deterrent which ALOA calls \\"deceptive because it provides a false sense of security\\". * Level 3 (medium): restricted keys. These keys are not generally available at retail outlets and often can only be obtained through a single source. The supplier has his own rules in place to prevent unauthorized duplication. * Level 2 (high): patented keys. By definition, patented keys are restricted. They also have the added feature of being protected by patent law. Anyone who sells such a key without permission of the patent holder could face financial penalties. * Level 1 (highest): factory-only patented keys. These keys cannot be cut locally. In addition to the restrictions above, users must send an authorization request to the factory to have additional keys cut and strict records are kept of each key. It is worth noting that none of these levels can protect against a user who loans a key to someone else and then falsely claims that the key was lost. Additional methods of key control include mechanical or electronic means. Systems Mechanical systems use a plastic peg that is attached to the key. This peg is securely locked into a numbered port and can‚Äôt be removed without an access peg. When someone authorized wants a key, they insert their personalized access peg into the port next to the key they want to remove. Then they rotate their access peg to the left while pulling out the key they want to remove. Their access peg can‚Äôt be removed until they return the key they removed to the same port they took it from and then they rotate their access peg to the right and then pull it out. When they remove their access peg it locks the keys back in the cabinet. If someone wants the key they removed during the time it is gone, they‚Äôll know who has it because their access peg has their name on it. Electronic systems also assign a key to a small device with a microchip that is inserted into a reader inserted into a cabinet. When an authorized user requests and removes a key it records that it was taken and when it was returned. It always lets others know who has the key when others request it. Essentially, it lets management know who took the key, when they took the key, how long they had the key and when they returned the key. There will always be a complete audit trail of every key that was used and anyone who used them.

He became known for his part in Elizabeth I's intelligence network inside the jail, smuggling letters to William Cecil, Lord Burghley, about people involved in the so-called Ridolfi plot, a Roman Catholic plan to assassinate the Queen and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots.Adams 2009. Privateering  William Herle has been alleged to be in the services of Sir William Garrard in the 1565‚Äôs as Garrard lord mayor of London had a market in the northern sea. This brought Herle to the attention to William Cecil who hired him in the mid-1560s to travel among the allies to England to supply them. Herle was sent to raid ships among the Themes as he took ships to form forging traders even causing Margaret, Duchess of Param, a Spanish regent in the Netherlands call to Elizabeth I to stop the private. In July of the year 1566, William Herle handed himself to William Cecil to be imprisoned and to be questioned for his pirating; this was one of many imprisonments he would face. For the trial of the July 1566, he was acquitted as he was not on the ship Tigger which was the one that was raiding the other ship. This is how many a time Herle would escape as he would be not on the ship that the pirating was on.Adams 2012. Imprisonment William Herle would be placed in prison a few time in his lifetime due to his crimes as a pirate. He was imprisoned in Marshalsea for many times. He would have been given the normal sentence of a pirate which was death to pirates but he often manages to escape by a loophole which he stayed in the jail, and he wrote of his experiences. William Herle wrote in his journal as well to William Cecil about the time he was in jail and the other prisoners because of his writing we have a better understanding of Tudor jail life.Adams 2009. One of these times was in 1571 where he wrote to William Cecil several times about the Ridolfi Plot.Adams 2010. He wrote to William Ciel of Mary of Scotlands guest and what he could tell what they spoke off.Bossy 1991. He even manages to get letters to William Ciel proving the plot against Elizabeth I.

Lady Seated at a Virginal Another painting, probably also by Johannes Vermeer known as A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals, belongs to a private collection shows also a young woman seated at a virginal. This painting and Lady Seated at a Virginal are quite separate works and are each known by alternate names and confusion between those two pieces may exist. Description The picture shows a woman facing left and playing a virginal. In the left foreground is a viola da gamba holding a bow between its strings. A landscape is painted on the inside lid of the virginal, and the painting on the wall is either the original or a copy of The Procuress by Dirck van Baburen (c. 1622, now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston), which belonged to Vermeer's mother-in-law. The Dimensions of the painting is 51.5 cm (20.3 in) height and 45.5 cm (17.9 in) width. Commentary Because of its style, the painting has been dated to about 1670. It has been suggested that it and Lady Standing at a Virginal (also owned by the National Gallery) may have been created as pendants, because their sizes, date and subject matter are all similar. A recent study has shown that the canvas for the two paintings came from the same bolt. In addition, the ground applied to the canvas appears identical to that used for both the Lady Standing and the New York Young Woman Seated. However their provenances before the 19th century differ, and Vermeer sometimes varied a theme in otherwise unrelated paintings. In the 19th century, both paintings were owned by the art critic Th√©ophile Thor√©, whose writings led to a resurgence of interest in Vermeer starting in 1866. The painting entered the National Gallery with the Salting Bequest in 1910. The painting is one of several works by Vermeer featuring keyboard instruments, including The Music Lesson, The Concert, and Lady Standing at a Virginal. Scholars believe these may all be based on the same instrument, built by Johannes Ruckers.

He served as Bishop of Wheeling from 1922 until his death in 1962. Biography One of nine children, John Swint was born in Pickens, West Virginia, to Peter and Caroline (n√©e Winkler) Swint, who were immigrants from Central Europe. He studied at St. Charles College in Ellicott City, Maryland, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1899. He then enrolled at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, later earning a Bachelor of Sacred Theology in 1904. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 23, 1904. After studying at the Apostolic Mission House in Washington, D.C. for a year, he returned to West Virginia and served as pastor of St. Patrick Church in Hinton (1905-1908). He was also head of the Diocesan Apostolate (1908-1914) and pastor of St. Patrick Church in Weston (1914-1922). On February 22, 1922, Swint was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Wheeling and Titular Bishop of Sura by Pope Pius XI. He was one of the first U.S. appointments of Pius XI, who was elected on the previous February 6. He received his episcopal consecration on May 11, 1922 from Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley, with Bishops Denis J. O'Connell and Hugh Charles Boyle serving as co-consecrators, at St. Joseph's Cathedral. Following the death of Bishop Patrick James Donahue, Swint was named the fourth Bishop of Wheeling on December 11, 1922. Swint was given the personal title of Archbishop by Pope Pius XII in 1954. In 1948, Swint took credit for the withdrawal of two or three women from the Miss America pageant with the threat of excommunication of Catholic contestants, claiming the pageant was \\"pagan\\" and if \\"nakedness\\" were removed from the pageant, it would \\"fall to pieces\\". One contestant, Mariruth Ford, defied the ban, participated in the pageant and was excommunicated. Nicknamed \\"God's Bricklayer,\\" he established twenty-five parishes, seven missions, two hospitals, two nursing homes, Sacred Heart Children's Home, Catholic Charities, and Wheeling College. He held the seventh (1923) and eighth (1933) diocesan synods. He laid the cornerstone for a new cathedral in May 1924, later dedicating the structure in April 1926. He also invited the Franciscans of the Immaculate Conception, the Sisters of St. Joseph, and the Pallottine Missionary Sisters into the diocese. He was named an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne in 1929. On the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of his priestly ordination, he was given the personal title of Archbishop on March 12, 1954. He authored The Moral Law (1933), The Parables of the Kingdom (1934), The Bread from Heaven (1935), Christ the Organizer of the Church (1936), Back to Christ (1940), Forgotten Truths (1940), and The Sweetest Story Ever Told (1947).

It is the home field of the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos baseball team as well as the Santa Barbara Foresters. History The stadium known simply as \\"Campus Diamond\\" or \\"Campus Stadium\\" opened in 1964, and underwent a major renovation and expansion after the 1993 college baseball season ended. The stadium was renamed for the late Caesar Uyesaka, a Santa Barbara resident and dedicated UCSB booster. The first game was hosted at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium on 5 February 1994 in a contest between UC Santa Barbara and the University of San Diego Toreros. UCSB won the game, 10‚Äì4. A unique baseball venue The stadium is designed with two levels, one on top of the other, where all seating is directly behind home plate. It offers a unique view in that the seats are \\"field level\\" and under the shade of the seating deck above it. The seating does not stretch past first or third base. There is no established seating in the outfield, although occasionally students stand behind the outfield fences. With Santa Barbara's Mediterranean climate, Caesar Uyesaka Stadium is a popular destination for students and the community alike in the spring and summer. The Santa Ynez Mountains can be seen beyond the outfield fence and southerly ocean breezes from the Pacific Ocean can be felt. The prevailing breeze off the ocean blows toward the outfield and makes the stadium a hitter-friendly park, despite the fact its outfield fences are farther than many major league ballparks. The Hammerheads Under coach Al Ferrer, UCSB improved its program in the late 1970s and 1980s. Along with this improvement came larger and more enthusiastic crowds. A group of students began taking the cardboard boxes given out at the concession stands to carry food and wore them sideways on their heads. Eventually this practice spread and the student section of rowdy supporters became known as the \\"hammerheads\\", after the distinctive look of hammerhead sharks. Renovations To accommodate the strain of hosting two baseball teams, Caesar Uyesaka Stadium has undergone many upgrades to provide an enjoyable experience to the crowds. Recent upgrades since 2006 include a clubhouse (including lockers and showers) and covered hitting/pitching facility. The upgrades, however, have not brought Caesar Uyesaka up to minimum standards to host an NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament regional or super regional tournament. The stadium lacks an adequate press facilities and the capacity is short of what the NCAA desires for a host site. UCSB hosted a 2015 regional at the Lake Elsinore Diamond in Riverside County, a drive which often takes more than three hours and is routed through Glendale and Pasadena, among other locales. Lights were added to the stadium prior to the 2020 season. The first night game at Caesar Uyesaka was played on 17 February 2020, with UCSB defeating the Cal Bears 17‚Äì7.

Ile Ilupeju, Ejigbo, Osun state. Brief history of Ejigbo Akinjole Ogiyan Abidoye, The founder of Ejigbo Land Ejigbo is a major Yoruba town in Osun State of Nigeria. It is about to Oshogbo, the capital of Osun State. According to oral history, Ejigbo is an ancient settlement. It was founded by Akinjole Ogiyan (abbreviation of \\"Ogiriniyan\\"), right after the old Oyo. Ogiyan has a rich pedigree, as a descendant of Oduduwa and the ruling family of Ile-Ife. Together with his brothers, particularly the Akire, the founder of Ikire-Ile, left Ile Ife with Oranya (Oranmiyan) - the founder of old Oyo, to establish their own town. The fact that the Ogiyan is from Ile-Ife, is confirmed by \\"Ejigbo Mekun\\" the name of a market in Ile-Ife. Akinjole settled many other villages spread around Yorubaland. He was the paramount ruler and prescribed authority over many if not all of them. The following towns and villages, among others, were under him: Ika, Igbon, Olosinmo, Ologede, Inisa, Aato, Ijimoba, Afake, Ilawo, Inisa Edoro, Isundunrin, Olla, Ado Ori-Oke, Ayegunle, Idigba, Ibogunde, Songbe, Olorin, Osuntedo and Iwata. Around 1835, Ejigbo came under Ibadan, when the Ibadan army moved to protect Osogbo from Ilorin invaders. In fact, detachments from Ejigbo assisted the Ibadan army in the Osogbo, Ijaye, Jalumi, Off, and Kiriji wars between 1840 and 1866. Ajayi Ogboriefon, Balogun and leader of the Ibadan army in the Jalumi war circa 1860 and 1878 was native of Ejigbo from the Akala compound. His mother, Alagbabi, was the daughter of an Ogiyan of Ejigbo. In 1934, when the then government returned to the terms of the 1893 Treaty, which recognized Ibadan's independence and gazettes of the Baale and Divisional Council of Ibadan as an Independent Native Authority, five district obas, including the Ogiyan, were made members of the divisional Council. The Ogiyan and council were also gazetted as subordinated to Native Authority under Ibadan for Ejigbo District Council. Although changes were made enlarging the membership of the Council between 1937 and 1938, the five districts Obas that included the Ogiyan retained their membership of the said Divisional Native Authority. Ejigbo people Travelling Ejigbo indigenes are well traveled. They have long history of international emigration, predominantly Ivory Coast, formerly known as C√¥te d'Ivoire, and have created border-less ECOWAS. Out of about a million and two hundred thousand Nigerians residing in C√¥te d'Ivoire since the 1900s till present, indigenes of the Ejigbo local government area made up of more than 50% of that population. This has been drastically affecting the population of Ejigbo township, Nigeria, due to continuous migration of her people to some neighbouring West African countries, notably: Benin Republic, Burkina Faso, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Liberia, Niger Republic, and Togo. The international exposure of Ejigbo people is evident in Ejigbo township. Wherever Ejigbo people are found, they live a communal lifestyle. This is done in order to maintain the unity and cordial relationship they enjoy before travelling out of the country. They are believed to be so established and organized in each big city and town in which they find themselves. For example, in C√¥te d'Ivoire, the Ejigbo people have a community leader they refer to as \\"Oba\\" of that area, such as 'Oba Bouake', 'Oba Abobo', 'Oba Dabou', 'Oba Grand Bassam', 'Oba Treichville' (etc.), while the 'Oba' who resides in Adjame, suburb of Abidjan, is called the \\"Oba Abidjan\\". He is regarded as the paramount Ejigbo community leader of C√¥te d'Ivoire. These ‚ÄòOba‚Äô performs an intermediary role between the government and his subjects. He is deemed to be the custodian of the migrants who fall within their jurisdiction. The 'Obas' also help new migrant, once they could speak a native language, to process the Ivorian permanent residence permit (card identete). All those so-designated Ejigbo community leaders are all recognized back at home by HRM, the Ogiyan of Ejigbo. Languages Apart from Ejigbo peoples' mother tongue (Yoruba language) and Nigeria's official language (English), some of the other foreign languages spoken today in Ejigbo include: French (second to Yoruba), Dioula (Mali), Eve (Togo), and Asante (Ghana). In Ejigbo today, along the street, few people have been speaking English. They speak and transact in French instead, because they are part and parcel of the Francophone world. The Ejigbo people are found in both West African and European Francophone cities. International personalities Descendants of Ejigbo people have the opportunity of having dual-nationality in every Francophone country where they dwell. In C√¥te d'Ivoire, for example, they are found in local and national administrative positions, such as inspector of education, health administration and local government councils. The case of Togo is unique. Ejigbo descendants born in Togo before 1991 are fully integrated and have full citizenship. Among them are the twin brothers Tidjani; while one was the Chief of Army Staff of late General Ghansimgbe Eyadema (former Togolese President who ruled for up to 40 years), the second brother was the rector of the only federal university. He is currently an economic adviser to the government of Togo (the twin brothers have Ejigbo royal family tribal marks). The parents of the Togolese international footballer, Adebayor and that of the Ivorian No.1 featherweight boxer as at 1986/87, Wahabi Spider, are from Ejigbo. Cultural heritage Cultural drum at Ejigbo Palace. Ogiyan Festival The festival of Orisa Ogiyan is still the most spectacular annual event in the town. During the festival, the Ogiyan, the ruler of the town is confined to his home for three months. The Orisa Ogiyan festival is held at the beginning of the harvest of new yams, usually in the rainy season. The Orisa is fed with new yam and epo pupa (palm oil). An important aspect of the festival is Ewo, the practice in which the people of the town divide themselves into two groups: the Isale Osolo and the Oke Mapo. They face each other in daylong whipping fights, as though in real battle. The origin of this tradition centers on a medicine-man, or an Ifa Priest, who, in Owonri Elejigbo and Ifa divination verse, is known as \\"Sawoleje\\". The man helped the town in time of crisis. He was caught sleeping with the wife of an Ogiyan, and was severely beaten almost to death. He then cursed the town's people, saying that unless they regularly beat themselves as they had beaten him, the town would face some calamity. The tradition goes that there must be fights in every festival, otherwise, the town would not be at peace, and the health of its people would be endangered. Ejigbo in recent times, now remains one of the most peaceful of Yoruba towns; tradition says Ejigbo is never overtaken by war. The festival has now turned into an annual carnival. Farming Poultry Keeping @Ogidiolu Farms, Ejigbo Farming is the traditional source of economy in Ejigbo. It is based on production of food crops, such as tubers (yam, cassava, cocoyam, potato, etc.), grains (maize, guinea corn), and cowpea; cash crops like cocoa, palm oil, kola-nut, coconut and varieties of fruits which include large production of pineapple. In the ancient times, the women helped in harvesting and selling of farm produce in the local markets. In some cases, such as palm oil, they engage in processing by extracting oil and the kernels from their shells. The land on which they farm is tropical dry forest and savanna, which has not been very much useful in the cultivation of cash crops, like cocoa and others in large quantities, as compared to other forested parts of Yoruba land. Kolanut is grown, but not in any large quantity. The farmlands are not very far from the town; therefore the people have always been urban dwellers. Modernization has taken farming activities in Ejigbo to a world level. There are large poultry, fisheries and animal husbandry farms (Ogidiolu Farms, Worgor Farms, etc.) in Ejigbo. In 2008, Ejigbo was ranked highest producer of life cat fish in Osun State. Mechanized palm-oil processing plants has taken the place of the manual methods, and land cultivation has been greatly improved. Economic activities The central traditional market, popularly known as \\"Oja Ejigbo\\", is located at the center of the town, in the front of palace. The market is fixed for every Saturday(occasionally on thursday) , as is the case in many Yoruba towns, and attracts merchants from all over Ejigbo town. There are also a handful of other such markets. Due to the commercial/agrarian nature of the town, the market is also the most favored for night shopping and other social activities. In the past, it was used as recreational center for the town, and therefore was attended by many who even had nothing to buy or sell. More so, modern commercial banks and micro-finance banks have become available in the town. Religion activities Ejigbo did not escape the influence, especially in the nineteenth century, of events that permeated Nigeria. Its people and culture change with the flow. For example, many people have been converted to Christianity and Islam. The Baptist, being the dominant Christian mission in the town, now has a number of churches, and it was through its efforts that the people of the town established the first full-fledged secondary Grammar School, the Ejigbo Baptist High School, followed by the Answer Ud Deen Grammar School. Ejigbo is tolerant of its diverse faiths. This is demonstrated in the joint celebration of the annual Orisa Ogiyan festival and other inter- religious and inter-denominational programs. Educational facilities The readily available and affordable educational facilities have placed Ejigbo and her inhabitants among the well-educated in the country. All levels of Nigerian educational facilities have been available in Ejigbo. These have ranged from well-equipped kindergartens, nursery schools, primary schools, secondary and grammar schools and tertiary institutions. Osun State University College of Agriculture is located at Ejigbo. A lot of other tertiary institutions in the southwest operate distance learning centers at Ejigbo.

It was located in the southwestern Tehachapis, from Tejon Creek and Tejon Canyon, west to Grapevine Canyon (Canada de las Uvas).NPS: Tejon Reservation History Establishment Edward F. Beale, the federal Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California, established this as the first Indian reservation in California in 1853. The 75,000 acre Tejon Reservation was within the private Rancho El Tej√≥n Mexican land grant. However, Beale hoped if the land claims were upheld the land could be purchased by the federal government. To gain support for his efforts, Beale named the reservation after United States Senator William K. Sebastian of Arkansas, Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. He supported Beale's plans to form a series of reservations, garrisoned by a military post, on government owned land. The Indians were to support themselves by farming. However, throughout the reservation's existence, drought, insects, and crop disease undermined the attempts at farming. The newly constructed Stockton ‚Äì Los Angeles Road, replacing El Camino Viejo, skirted the western and northern sides of the reservation. The reservation became operational in September 1853, and some California Indians moved in voluntarily. Among the tribes of Mission Indians the reservation held, were 300 Emigdiano Chumash, whose homeland had included Tejon Canyon. In 1854, Lieutenant Beale reported that 2,500 Indians were living on the Sebastian Reservation. In 1854, Fort Tejon was built to the southwest, to protect both the reservation's Indians and white settlers in the region from raids by the Paiutes, Chemeheui, Mohave peoples, and other Indian groups of the desert regions to the east. It was also to control the Indians who were living on the Tejon Reservation, and protect them from attacks by American immigrants and settlers. Operations Farm equipment, cattle and sheep were brought to Tejon Reservation, and a staff of white employees hired to teach the Indians agriculture and supervise their activities. Hundreds of aces of land were plowed and planted with wheat, barley, and corn. Tejon Creek irrigated gardens, vineyards, and orchards. From the forest in upper Tejon Canyon Indians hauled timber from which they sawed the lumber needed at the reservation. Additionally there was wild game to hunt for in the Tehachapi Mountains and the San Joaquin Valley. In that year the Indians gathered an abundant wheat harvest. In early 1854, with political change in Washington, Beale's detractors charged him with embezzlement of government funds. Settlers in the San Joaquin Valley resented the agricultural competition from the Indians, and claimed that too much land had been set aside for them. He was removed from his office, but was exonerated of the charges. Colonel Thomas J. Henley, was Beale's replacement as Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California. When Henley took charge, he noted only 800 Indians, with fewer than 350 present at one time, and only 1,500 acres under cultivation, indicating that numbers of Indians and amount of acreage under cultivation had been inflated by Beale. Henley established other reservations in California, and appointed Colonel James R. Vineyard as the resident agent at the Sebastian Reservation. In 1855, some of the reservation's Indian residents fled, and Vineyard requested assistance from Fort Tejon to find them and force their return. The fort's commander refused, stating their role was to protect the Indians and punish any that committed hostile acts, but not return Indians that voluntarily resided on the reservation.Boyd, 1972, p. 28. In 1856, rainfall was sparse but the harvest was enough for the 700 inhabitants that remained. A flour mill, granary, storehouse, and dwellings for the resident agent and the chiefs were built. A physician was also provided. In November 1856, the reservation was reduced to 25,000 acres. For 1856, the 700 Indians were reported as having 700 acres under cultivation. In 1857, drought continued, resulting in crop failure except were irrigation reached them and those grapevines and fruit trees that began to yield a harvest. The Indians were also encouraged to collect wild food during the winter. Despite that setback, new buildings were constructed and new arrivals increased the population to over 1,000. A post office was established at the reservation in September 1858, but it was moved in 1859 to Sinks of Tejon Station, one of the stagecoach stations of the Butterfield Overland Mail. By 1858, nearly all of the remaining inhabitants were living in houses. Several families were raising livestock, and the women had learned to make American style clothing. By 1859, Henley had been replaced as Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California. Finally, the winter of 1861‚Äî1862 was very wet causing Great Flood of 1862. It did break the 5-year drought, so the Reservation's Indians planted larger fields of grain, and there was a productive harvest during 1862. Additional Indians were encouraged to settle at the Sebastian Reservation, beyond the thirteen hundred that already lived there. During the 1863 drought year, all the crops were lost except for 30 tons of hay. Settlers encroached on the Tejon Reservation's unsurveyed and unfenced land, with their cattle and sheep eating reservation crops. Demise Meanwhile, by 1863 former agent Edward F. Beale had purchased five contiguous ranchos in the Tejon area, which included the Tejon Reservation land, and was raising 100,000 sheep. In 1863, he offered to lease 12,000 acres to the government, but withdrew the offer when he found that the government planned to move Owens Valley Paiute Indians there. He noted that he had made the offer only because Indians already on the reservation were his friends. In the summer of 1863, over 900 Owens Valley Paiute were marched through the Mojave Desert towards the Tejon Reservation, following their capitulation in the Owens Valley Indian War. They ended up in the Tule River Indian Reservation. The reservation was ordered closed in June 1864. Fort Tejon was also abandoned in 1864.Boyd, 1972. p. 19-26. Jose Pacheco, a Tej√≥n leader, wrote to General Wright on April 16, 1864: > \\"I should not have troubled you with this letter, Dear General, did I not > think the agents here had wronged us. You and our great father at Washington > do not know how bad we fare, or you would give us food or let us go back to > our lands where we can get plenty of fish and game. I do not think we get > the provisions intended for us by our Great Father; the agents keep it from > us, and sell it to make themselves rich, while we and our children are very > poor and hungry and naked.\\" On July 11, Austin Wiley wrote: \\"I have the honor to inform you that all the Indians on the Tejon Farm and in the vicinity of Fort Tejon, some two hundred in number, have been removed from there to the Tule River farm.\\" Wiley noted that there was no food for the Indians at Tejon. Shortly thereafter, D. N. Cooley, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, summarized the reasons for the reservation's failure: > \\"The lack of legal title to the land severely restrained investment in > construction and development, leaving the reserve and the Indians on it in a > state of constant uncertainty. The ideal of converting Indians from food > gathering to settled agriculture was never realized.\\" See also * Chumash people * Tejon Indian Tribe of California * Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation * Indigenous peoples of California References  External links  * National Park Service: A History of American Indians in California‚Äîthe Tejon Indian Reservation * Historical Marker Database‚ÄîHMdb.org: The Sebastian Indian Reservation * Bakersfield.com: The Sebastian Indian Reservation Category:American Indian reservations in California Category:Chumash Category:History of Kern County, California Category:Native American history of California Category:Tehachapi Mountains Category:Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass Category:1850s in California Category:1860s in California Category:Populated places established in 1853 Category:1853 establishments in California Category:1864 disestablishments in California Category:Former American Indian reservations ","title":"Sebastian Indian Reservation"},{"id":"24416775","text":"The 121st Delaware General Assembly was a meeting of the legislative branch of the state government, consisting of the Delaware Senate and the Delaware House of Representatives.

Noted for its integration with the surrounding architecture and landscape, the museum building won a 2009 RIBA European Award and was short-listed for the Stirling prize the same year. History An architecture competition for the design of a building was won by Tony Fretton in May 2005. Construction started in August 2006 and the museum was inaugurated in January 2008. Building The Fuglsang Art Museum is located in a whitewashed, modernistic building, designed to fit into the existing architecture of the Fuglsang estate and the surrounding landscape. The galleries are arranged around a long corridor which itself serves as a significant exhibition space. At the end of the corridor is a small room with three large windows, one of which is slightly offset from the axis and visible from the corridor. With no artworks displayed, it is entirely dedicated to contemplation and viewing of the exterior landscape. On one side of the corridor are fairly small galleries with gold ornaments inspired by the architecture of the adjoining Fuglsang manor house. These are dedicated to smaller scale works. On the other side of the corridor are larger toplit galleries. Collections The museum houses a notable collection of Danish art ranging from the end of the 18th century to the current day and includes paintings, sculptures and sketches. The collection has an emphasis on local artists and motifs. Paintings The museum holds approximately 500 paintings, with a few dating from the late 18th century and the Danish Golden Age during the first half of the 19th century, while the main focus of the collection is on paintings from around 1900. Represented are important Danish artists like the Skagen Painters, the Fynboerne, Theodor Philipsen, L. A. Ring and Vilhelm Hammersh√∏i. Sculpture The collection features around 199 sculptures, dating from the late 19th century to 1950. The main emphasis is on the period 1930-50. Works on paper The museum's extensive collection of drawings, watercolours and particularly graphic works are mainly from the 20th century. Exhibitions and other activities Fuglsang Art Museum has regular shows of its works and arranges several special exhibitions annually. Moreover, the shows and special exhibitions are complemented with a diverse programme of arrangements and presentations. There is also an interdisciplinary school service attached to the museum.

The typical issue was four letter-size pages sent to subscribers under a second-class mail permit. Its founder, editor and publisher was P. S. Harrison (1880‚Äì1966), who previously had been a reviewer for Motion Picture News, in which his column was titled \\"Harrison‚Äôs Exhibitor Reviews\\". The first issue, dated 5 July 1919, stated that film advertising would not be accepted. A year's subscription cost $10. For more than a year, the type was set by a typewriter. The issue of 4 December 1920 and all subsequent issues were professionally typeset. The masthead of 1 January 1921 proclaimed itself ::FREE FROM THE INFLUENCE OF ADVERTISING In later years, that slogan was changed to ::A REVIEWING SERVICE FREE FROM THE INFLUENCE OF FILM ADVERTISING Since most movie theaters in the United States prior to the 1940s were owned and operated by movie studios as outlets for the exhibition of those studios‚Äô movies, independently owned theaters were the principal subscription base of Harrison‚Äôs Reports and the publication's editorials consequently addressed the interests of independent theaters. During its 44 calendar years of operation, more than 2,200 issues of Harrison‚Äôs Reports were published. Approximately 17,000 feature films were reviewed; shorts were not reviewed, although their titles were listed in the indexes published several times a year. Subscription base Prior to the 1940s, most movie theaters in the United States were owned and operated by movie studios as outlets for the exhibition of those studios‚Äô movies. Since the management of those theaters had little choice as to what movies they played, they had little or no use for Harrison‚Äôs Reports. Independently owned theaters were consequently the principal subscription base of Harrison‚Äôs Reports and the publication's editorials addressed the interests of independent theaters. In 1937 there were approximately 3,000 subscribers at $15 per year.‚ÄùIron Moulder to Cinema Critic‚Äù by Sanderson Vanderbilt; New York Herald Tribune; 10 October 1937. Opposition to product placement From its review of The Garage (1920) to its last year of publication, Harrison‚Äôs Reports unyieldingly opposed product placement in movies. Other films criticized for brand name products appearing on screen include * The Lost World (1925) * Palmy Days (1931) * Impact (1949) * Love Happy (1949) Management and ownership changes *The 10 March 1956 issue printed the first appearance of a name other than P.S. Harrison on the masthead, Al Picoult, managing editor, who bought control of the paper from Harrison. * In June 1959, Picoult sold the paper to individuals associated with exhibitor, Allied States, which the paper had been close to and supported for many years. Harrison still retained an interest. *The issue of 18 July 1959 showed Harrison's name on the masthead as ‚Äúfounder‚Äù (the previous week he had been ‚Äúeditor‚Äù), and David Martin was the new editor. The following week's issue (25 July 1959) mentioned Harrison's retirement. *David Martin's name disappeared from the masthead with the issue of 6 February 1960. Wynn Loewenthal was the new editor. *The masthead of 8 July 1961 showed a $2 increase in the price of a yearly subscription to $17, the first increase in 25 years. *The first article of 5 August 1961 was titled ‚ÄúEditorial Transition‚Äù, stating there would be a new editor; nobody's name appeared on the masthead of that issue. On 12 August 1961, Martin Starr became editor. Final issues The last issue was a two-page sheet dated 1 September 1962. It was headlined \\"MAYBE, IT'S NOT YET \\"30\\".\\" It lamented the financial woes of exhibitors in general. It also expressed hope that funding could be found to continue Harrison‚Äôs Reports. The issue of 18 August 1962 was the last to carry reviews with the last reviews being Five Weeks in a Balloon, Waltz of the Toreadors and Der Rosenkavalier directed by Paul Czinner. Reprints The entire run of Harrison's Reports has been reprinted in a 15-volume set of library-bound hardcover books, including an index of titles. The series is titled Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews (1919-1962). The Media History Digital Library has scans of the archive from 1927‚Äì1962 available online. Two other significant English-language periodicals with 10,000 or more film reviews have appeared reprinted in book form: * Variety, as Variety Film Reviews (1907‚Äì1996) in 24 volumes. * The New York Times, as The New York Times Film Reviews (1913‚Äì2000) in 22 volumes.

It uses digitized images of real actors with blood and gore, similar to Midway's arcade hit Mortal Kombat. Ports for the Super NES and Sega Genesis were announced in early 1994, but quietly cancelled the following year. The monks from Viper's stage later appeared in Dyna Gear, another arcade game developed by Scarab and published by Sammy. Plot The birthplace of the powerful physical martial arts called \\"Survival Arts\\" and how they were earned became mysterious for quite some time. However, eight warriors spreading over different countries have learned some of the most important skills of the Survival Arts, while they continue learning more about them. Each one qualified for the Survival Arts tournament to see which survivor will win and obtain all the secrets of the Arts. Gameplay Survival Arts is quite similar to Midway's Mortal Kombat franchise in terms of presentation, but with gameplay inspired by Capcom's Street Fighter II. The player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. Players have a character roster of eight fighters to choose from the start, each with their own fighting style and special techniques. One unique feature is that players can pick up multiple weapons (from swords to guns) that are dropped on stage and use against the opponent. Depending on what move or weapon the player uses as the last hit against the opponent while it knocks him or her out, the defeated opponent will either be burned, disassembled, sliced in half in two different ways, decapitated or electrocuted, which is as simple as performing deaths in Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior. While combos can be performed in the game, they can end with a death, which makes it a precursor to the \\"Brutalities\\" in Mortal Kombat 3 and some of its successors. Characters There are eight playable characters, and one final boss. * (actor: Jon Walter) - The protagonist of the game. A rich martial artist who enters the Survival Arts tournament to earn enough money to build his own dojo. * (actor: Brian Creech) - A former police officer who noticed that Dantel is not a human being. Gunner smuggles himself into the Survival Arts tournament to defeat and reveal the secret of Dantel. * (actor: Kanda David) - A former military soldier who knows how to fight efficiently and considers fighting to be worth living with. He is always the first character the player faces in arcade mode. * (actress: Saskia) - A member of the ninja group \\"Cobra Faction\\", she enters the Survival Arts tournament to learn how to fight against a rival faction, \\"The Tigers\\". * (actor: Hideaki Takahashi) - An extraterrestrial who feels that the Survival Arts tournament will earn him a place on planet Earth. Due to a life of suffering in the world of human beings, he tries to gain strength for his two children. * (actor: Hose Brand) - An evil professional wrestler who decides to enter the Survival Arts tournament to make himself stronger, although he feels he came up to his limit. * (actor: Takeaki Katoh) - Like Tashia, Hiryu is part of the \\"Cobra Faction\\" group and tries to learn how to fight against his rivals, \\"The Tigers\\", by entering the Survival Arts tournament. * (actress: Monica Brown) - A female warrior from the desert whose family got murdered by a messenger. She decides to enter the Survival Arts tournament to retaliate for the messenger's murdering. * (actor: Sam Radetsky) - The antagonist of the game and founder of the Survival Arts. In order to become immortal, he must eat the flesh of strong humans. Instead of choosing a successor, he has made his followers fight against each other.

In the 2009 parliamentary election, she was the youngest person to be elected to the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget). Hanekamhaug represents the county of M√∏re og Romsdal. Background After finishing secondary school in Molde, Hanekamhaug started working towards a bachelor's degree at BI Norwegian Business School in 2008. She has been involved in politics since 2004, when she became chairman of the local youth wing of the Progress Party (Youth of the Progress Party). Both her parents are active in the party, her mother as a county council representative, her father as a member of the municipal council. She went on to become chairman of the county youth organisation in 2005, and a member of the county council in 2007. From 2007 to 2008, she also worked as a trainee for the central organisation of the party, in the role of personal assistant to party leader Siv Jensen. In 2010 Hanekamhaug decided to become active in the youth organization, and took the role as first deputy chairman. Parliament Hanekamhaug was nominated as the Progress Party's third candidate from M√∏re og Romsdal in the 2009 parliamentary election, and was elected because of good results for her party in that part of Norway. At 22 years, she became the youngest representative in the assembly. Her seat, however, was the final leveling seat in parliament, and as such was at first somewhat precarious. It was reported on 21 September that her seat had been lost, though later the same day it became clear that this information was due to a data entry error. Final results were released on 24 September, confirming Hanekamhaug's seat. Views and issues Hanekamhaug received some negative attention for a remark she made at a school debate, comparing Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg to the sexual predator known as \\"The Pocket Man\\", intended as a criticism of the government's fiscal policies. She later apologised for this statement. She was also ridiculed for an interview where she allegedly stated that she did not consider books to be culture, which she later claimed to have said that she did not consider reading books a cultural experience, and that she had a great interest in Norwegian literature. Hanekamhaug is particularly involved in educational politics and issues of road safety and infrastructure. She has mentioned among her political idols United States President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Norwegian Progress Party politician Carl I. Hagen.

It is about long, flowing in a generally southwesterly direction. Draining a broad valley bounded by the Santa Ana Mountains and Santa Margarita Mountains, San Mateo Creek is notable for being one of the last unchannelized streams in Southern California. One of the least developed watersheds on the South Coast, San Mateo Creek's drainage basin covers in parts of the Cleveland National Forest and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. The first inhabitants were Native Americans primarily of the Acjachemen and Luise√±o groups, followed by the Spanish who established ranchos in the area. The creek's usually perennial flow made it an important source of irrigation water, then in the later 19th century, there was a gold rush in the upper watershed. Most of the little development in the watershed is now agriculture-based. The San Mateo Creek watershed includes the subwatersheds of Los Alamos Canyon Creek, Tenaja Canyon Creek, Devil Canyon Creek and Cristianitos Creek with its tributaries of Talega and Gabino Creeks. Although grazing activities have hurt the biological quality of the semi-arid, Mediterranean-climate watershed, it still supports numerous biological communities including riparian zones, grassland and coastal sage scrub. A population of steelhead trout has recently been identified in the creek, which is affected by continuing groundwater pumping, and which may have been minimally impacted by minor agricultural runoff prior to cessation of farming activities along the stream aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. Course The -long San Mateo Creek begins its course in a canyon in the extreme southeastern end of the Santa Ana Mountains, which lie mostly in Riverside County. From there, the creek continues through a steep and narrow gorge for the first part of its course, then a broad and shallower valley for the second part. It receives four major tributaries and many smaller ones on its generally southwest journey to the Pacific Ocean. San Mateo Creek has its source, at an elevation of 2800 feet, Beatrice Dawson Wood, Water Supply paper 297; Gazetteer of Surface Waters of California, Pt. 3, Pacific Coast and Great Basin streams, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, 1913, p.190 in the canyon on the west face of the unofficially named 3,591 ft. San Mateo Peak,Lower Peaks Committee, Angeles Club, Sierra Club, Sierra Club Lower Peaks Committee Guide, 2009 edition, Lower Peaks Committee, Fullerton, 2009 at the western end of the ridge running west then northwest from Elsinore Peak to Morrell Canyon, south and west of the Morrell Potrero in the Elsinore Mountains. From its headwaters south of Lake Elsinore inside the Cleveland National Forest, San Mateo Creek runs southwards through the valley of the old Rancho at the Potrero de la Cienaga which as its name suggests feeds the creek with several springs. The canyon widens and deepens until it is roughly in depth. After running south for several miles it turns southeast to the Tenaja Falls where it tumbles down to its confluence with Los Alamos Canyon Creek, that comes in from the left. This creek with its tributary Wildhorse Canyon Creek and two unnamed arroyos drain the southern slopes of Elsinore Peak. Another unnamed arroyo drains the western Santa Rosa Plateau and the east slope of the Squaw Mountain highland and descends to the north to join the creek where it turns to the west.Unnamed arroyo draining east slope of the Squaw Mountain highland and western Santa Rosa Plateau, USGS Map Name: Wildomar, CA, Map Center: from topoquest.com accessed on 5/4/2013 San Mateo Creek at Tenaja Truck Trail crossing near Tenaja Falls Trailhead From its confluence with Los Alamos Canyon Creek, San Mateo Creek turns its course southwest down San Mateo Canyon, cutting a deep arid canyon surrounded by slopes dissected by many side canyons between the Santa Ana and Santa Margarita Mountains. USGS Map Title: Wildomar, CA, from topoquest.com accessed on 4/16/2013 USGS Map Name: Sitton Peak, CA, from topoquest.com accessed on 4/16/2013 At river mile (RM) 18 or river kilometer (RK) 28.9, Tenaja Canyon Creek, which flows generally northwest, comes in from the left. Shortly after, at RM 17.5 (RK 28.1) Bluewater Canyon Creek descends from Sitton Peak, to merge with San Mateo Canyon from the right. Nickel Canyon Creek also comes in from the right, descending from the Verdugo Potrero shortly afterward, joining San Mateo Creek just north of the Riverside ‚Äì San Diego County line. The creek then continues to flow southwards and Devil Canyon Creek draining the eastern slope of the Santa Margarita Mountains with its tributary, Cold Spring Canyon Creek, comes in from the left at RM 15 (RK 24.1). The Devil Canyon Creek confluence approximately marks the point where San Mateo Creek leaves the Cleveland National Forest. Soon, the narrow -deep canyon gives way to a broad alluvial valley. San Mateo Creek flows past Camp Pendleton, a United States Marine Corps amphibious training base. At RM 3.7 (RK 5.95) Cristianitos Creek, the largest tributary, joins from the right. Cristianitos Creek begins in extreme southeastern Orange County and drains about , that includes its tributaries of Talega Canyon Creek and Gabino Canyon Creek and its tributary La Paz Canyon Creek that enter it from the left. Lagoon at termination San Mateo Creek then crosses under Interstate 5 and empties into a small, perennial freshwater lagoon bounded by a sandbar at San Onofre State Beach. The lagoon only empties into the sea during the rainy season. This portion of the creek is very close to San Clemente and a small residential area is just to the northeast side of the lagoon. The lagoon remains similar to its natural state as well, although it is increasingly becoming harmed by unnatural pollutants. Geologic history Geologically the San Mateo Creek watershed is dominated by the Santa Ana Mountains, whose underlying bedrock consists of Jurassic-age igneous and sedimentary rock, overlain by a few thousand vertical feet of Cretaceous-age granite, gabbro, and tonalite. Underneath the San Mateo Creek valley's several hundred feet of alluvial deposits, there are layers of sandstone, limestone, siltstone, mudstone, shale and conglomerate. These formations are present along most of the streams draining off the west slope of the Santa Ana Mountains and are practically identical as far north as Santiago Creek, which is in north-central Orange County nearly away. The alluvial deposits originate from the Wisconsinian glaciation, in which massive glaciers and ice sheets advanced over much of North America and shifted the global climate. During this roughly 60,000-year-long period that ended in approximately 8000 B.C., Southern California received up to of rainfall per year, and this radical climate change coincided with a drop in sea level. As the sea levels fell, streams flowing into the Pacific from Southern California began to erode massive canyons in their floodplains. The rivers eventually eroded to or so below their previous elevation. When the Wisconsinian period ended, sea level rose, filled these canyons and turned them into long, narrow inlets. Because the heavy rains ceased with the departure of the Wisconsinian, the rivers and streams once again became slow-flowing. Over the course of thousands of years, these calm inlets gradually filled with alluvial sediments, giving them the flat valley floors they have today. Over time, sea level dropped slightly again, allowing the rivers to once again entrench channels into their floodplains, resulting in the broad river terraces that line much of lower San Mateo Creek, Arroyo San Onofre and San Juan Creek. Soils Most of the soils in the San Mateo Creek drainage area are loamy, well-drained and also fertile in the lowlands. In the mountains the soil cover is very shallow and there are many exposed cliffs, large boulders and outcroppings of sedimentary rock. In the lower watershed are sandy or silty loams which have a clay substructure. These soils are classified as highly fertile and there are a few farms on the foothills and the floodplain of the San Mateo Creek watershed. Watershed San Mateo Canyon Wilderness in the northwest upper basin The San Mateo Creek drainage basin covers mostly in San Diego County and partially in Orange County. It shares boundaries with several watersheds ‚Äì including Segunda Deshecha Ca√±ada to the west, Arroyo San Onofre to the southeast, and streams draining into Lake Elsinore in the northeast. It is slightly larger than the San Juan Creek watershed, which borders on the San Mateo Creek watershed's northeastern side. The upper reaches of the watershed consist primarily of canyons that are deep and broad, while the lower watershed is a valley wide and less than deep. The largest tributary of San Mateo Creek is Cristianitos Creek (in Christianitos Canyon), which is about long and with its tributaries, drains in the western portion of the watershed with a portion in Orange County. Other significant sub-basins in the watershed include Talega Canyon, La Paz Creek and Gabino Creek, all of which are tributaries of Cristianitos Canyon. The Santa Ana Mountains form the drainage divide with San Juan Creek on the northwest side of the San Mateo Creek valley, and the Santa Margarita Mountains on the southeast separate San Mateo Creek from the Arroyo San Onofre, a creek that drains westwards to the Pacific Ocean. Arroyo San Onofre is also the closest major stream to San Mateo Creek by location of the mouth. The next closest is Segunda Deshecha Ca√±ada, further north. Much of the upper San Mateo Creek watershed is encompassed by the central Cleveland National Forest and the lower lies mostly within Camp Pendleton. The closest city is San Clemente, northwest of the creek's mouth. San Mateo Creek was once a seasonal stream that would flow through the rainy season, run dry by June or July and restart in October. Although springs exist in the mountains, once the creek spilled onto its floodplain, it would seep into the ground and run in a subsurface manner. Irrigation return flows and a sewage treatment plant have increased its flows to perennial, although it does not receive as much runoff as most other Southern California streams. The typical annual peak flow is around , while the 2-year flood is , the 10-year event, , and the 100-year flood, . Ecology Plants Supporting a highly productive ecosystem, the San Mateo Creek watershed includes a high variety of elevations and vegetation groups. These include riparian zones and woodlands around the perennial or semi-perennial streams, grassland on the valley floors, and chaparral and coastal sage scrub on the hillsides. Overall the vegetation groups and their distribution are very similar to that of San Juan Creek and its major tributary, Trabuco Creek, in the northwest. The major difference is that the San Mateo Creek watershed contains no major residential areas. The mouth of the creek and its last reaches shortly above and below Camp Pendleton are host to a wide variety of riparian plants. At the mouth, there is a freshwater lagoon and several freshwater marshes, surrounded by a riparian woodland consisting primarily of willow, sycamore, live oak and cottonwood. Surrounding the lower San Mateo Creek valley and on the shallow slopes is the coastal sage scrub community, which consist primarily of coast goldenbush, coyote brush, California sagebrush, mulefat, toyon, poison oak, laurel sumac, California mugwort, Mexican elderberry, and California encelia. At the very mouth, where groundwater surfaces on the streambed, there are the stands of trees, and undergrowth includes wild cucumber and gooseberry. Freshwater marshes surrounding San Mateo Creek exist in a strip just a few hundred feet wide and draw their water supply primarily from emerging groundwater. The most prominent plants are bulrush, specifically California bulrush, and cattail. There are also several species of burweeds and ferns, and on the edges of the marshes and on the surrounding small meadows, goldenrod, hedge-nettle, fleshy jaumea, Mexican rush, saltgrass, and iceplant. Animals In February, 1999, steelhead (Oncorhyncus mykiss irideus) were discovered in the creek by Toby Shackelford, making San Mateo Creek the only watercourse south of Malibu Creek in Los Angeles County with steelhead in the endangered Southern California Steelhead DPS. Steelhead have historically spawned in the creek, whose upper reaches also support a population of coastal rainbow trout, the stream resident form of O. m. irideus. There are about of streams in the watershed that provide suitable habitat for steelhead. Significantly, DNA analysis has shown that San Mateo Creek steelhead are genetically native southern steelhead, and not hatchery stocked fish. Steelhead in San Mateo Creek spawn primarily in the winter, when heavy storm runoff from the Santa Ana and Santa Margarita Mountains raises the creek's flow enough to breach the sandbar at San Onofre State Park. In the few weeks or months following when there is still a substantial flow in the creek, the steelhead spawn and then the adults return to sea. In the dry months following the streams in the lowlands shrink to small pools that still support amphibians and small fish including steelhead fry which need to spend about one year in freshwater. Recently, steelhead have been sighted in the creek in greater numbers, bringing attention to coastal San Diego and Orange County streams. Other fish and amphibian species in the watershed include the endangered tidewater goby and arroyo toad. Tidewater goby reside in small to medium-sized, brackish sloughs and marshes near the mouth of the creek. The watershed also has a number of birds; endangered species include the least Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus), California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica) and willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii). In early February, 2010 a golden beaver (Castor canadensis subauratus) was captured in a live trap by San Onofre State Beach officers who discovered the beaver at the river mouth of San Mateo Creek. According to State Parks officials, the species was once native to the San Mateo Creek watershed, but were thought to be extinct. Beaver were also found in an ecological survey of the lagoon near the creek mouth in 1987. A report on the fauna of the county by Dr. David Hoffman in 1866 stated \\"Of the animal kingdom we have a fair variety: the grizzly bear, the antelope, the deer, the polecat, the beaver, the wildcat, the otter, the fox, the badger, the hare, the squirrel, and coyotes innumerable.\\" The beaver may have accessed San Mateo Creek from the Santa Margarita River watershed where golden beaver were re-introduced around 1940. Indirect evidence of beaver in San Diego County includes a creek named Beaver Hollow which runs 3.25 miles into the Sweetwater River about 6.5 miles southwest of Alpine. Beaver Hollow is named on the USGS Topo Map for Cuyamaca in 1903, which is twenty years before California Department of Fish and Game began beaver re- introductions in California. History Evidence suggests that Native Americans have inhabited the lower reaches of San Mateo Creek watershed for at least 8,000 years. One of the largest villages was Panhe, an Acjachemen Indian village located at the confluence of San Mateo Creek and Cristianitos Canyon, approximately upstream from the Pacific Ocean. The Native Americans fished in San Mateo Creek's extensive freshwater marshes, and practiced a hunter- gatherer lifestyle. The village of Panhe is estimated to have had a population of 300 or so before the first Spanish explorers came to the area, and is still a sacred site for the Native Americans. Another Native American group, the Luise√±o lived in the upper tributaries. San Mateo Creek mouth at San Onofre State Beach The first non-native people to see the creek were the Spanish explorers of the Gaspar de Portol√° expedition of 1769 to Monterey Bay, who camped near the creek on July 22. Padre Juan Crespi related in his diary that, in a native village nearby, it was found that two young girls were dying. The Franciscan missionaries were given permission to baptize the two girls, and so Crespi called the place \\"Los Christianos\\". The name was later changed to the diminutive \\"Christianitos\\" (little Christians) and given to the creek. Spanish names were later given to many other creeks and canyons in the area, including San Juan Creek, Santiago Creek, and Arroyo San Onofre, many of which names remain. After the construction of Mission San Juan Capistrano near the present-day city of the same name, the San Mateo Creek Valley was settled by the Spanish and extensively farmed and irrigated. These practices hurt the groundwater and hydrology of the area, which is slowly recovering. Mexico became independent of Spain in 1822 and secularized the missions in 1833, which brought an end to the mission period. Thousands of acres of land formerly owned by the missions, often containing working ranches, was split into large land grants called ranchos. The Rancho Santa Margarita y Las Flores was granted to Pio and Andres Pico in 1841. They planted non-native crops, pumped water from the aquifer, and grazed cattle, severely damaging the grasslands and riparian habitat. By 1860, a discovery of gold, zinc, lead and silver in the upper San Mateo Creek watershed led American miners to the area. The rancho went through many hands and there were many conflicts with Native Americans before the U.S. Navy, in 1941, purchased most of the land for Camp Pendleton for around $6.5 million. Recently a controversy has erupted over whether to extend California State Route 241 south through the lower San Mateo Creek valley to join Interstate 5 near the creek's mouth. The project was proposed to improve traffic flow on the Orange-San Diego County border. While proponents of the project claim that it will relieve congestion on the interstate and not affect the native habitat, opponents argue that the routing would increase sediment loads in the creek, damage the surf break at San Onofre State Beach, create water pollution and hurt several endangered animal species.

It was played on Monday, January 1, 1940, at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Background Texas A&M;, the 1939 SWC Champion, declined to be in this game, instead playing in the Sugar Bowl. Tennessee of the SEC and Oklahoma of the Big Six also declined this game. Fearing for the longevity of the game, J. Curtis Sanford strove to keep the bowl game alive, extending invites to Clemson and BC, who accepted; this was the first bowl game for both schools. With both teams from outside the region, attendance was low; the first three editions (and next six) included a team from the state of Texas. Game summary Boston College took the lead on a 30-yard field goal by Alex Lukachik early in the second quarter, after four failed plays following a punt return to the Clemson 13. After both teams exchanged punts throughout most of the quarter, Clemson got it back at their 43. They drove 57 yards and it culminated with a touchdown by sophomore Charlie Timmons, but the extra point was missed. The remainder of the game was scoreless as Clemson won their first bowl game, and All-American back Banks McFadden was named the game's most valuable player. Aftermath Boston College returned to the Cotton Bowl Classic 45 years later in 1985 and won, led by Heisman Trophy winner Clemson returned in 2018 with a 30-3 College Football Playoff semifinal victory over Notre Dame. The teams have been conference foes since 2005, when BC joined the Atlantic Coast Conference. Since 2008, the O'Rourke‚ÄìMcFadden Trophy is awarded to the winner of the annual Boston College‚ÄìClemson game, honoring Charlie O'Rourke of BC and McFadden of Clemson, leaders of their teams in the 1940 Cotton Bowl.

Previously, the lineup also included MC Willow, but he left the group in 2014. The group has played alongside and toured in support of some of Australia's biggest artists, including Jebediah, Bliss n Eso, Drapht, The Herd and Pez. Biography What was originally a duo, Willow (Rowan Lockyer) and Smiles Again (Martin Brown) met at St.Pius X College Chatswood in Year 7. By Year 9 Lockyer and Brown were practicing their freestyle skills and working together on what would become the roots of their music. Mind Over Matter first surfaced on the Australian hip hop scene in 2006 with a short mixtape titled For Our Hip Hoppers. This independent release resulted in Mind Over Matter signing to Sydney Based Nurcha Records for their Debut LP Keepin' It Breezy'. The album features Dj Ilz on the majority of the tracks and although not an official member of the group, DJ Ilz has been touring and performing with the group since 2006. Keepin' It Breezy was executively produced by Phatchance and Drakezilla and recorded at Ilz studios in Sydney, the album received accolades in Australian Street Press and Media. The group appeared on the Triple J Hip Hop show to discuss the album with Hau (of Koolism) and the first single for the album Proud received national rotation on the station. The second single for the album \\"Clipped Wings\\" featured Vast Aire of Cannibal Ox fame and garnered single of the week on FBi Radio, the group were also interviewed on the station as part of the weekly hip hop show. In 2009 the group released a second mixtape entitled Free the Wolves. The mixtape was executively produced by Phatchance and serves as a bridge between the first album and their next official release; it was called a departure from the happy-go-lucky sound of Keepin' It Breezy. The band launched the mixtape to a sold-out crowd at Oxford Arts Factory performing with Dj Illa and Saving Grace for a youth based charity Exodus Youth Worx. On 18 March 2011 the duo released their sophomore record Just Like Fireworks. In 2014 Mind Over Matter announced that they had become a trio with the introduction of their new DJ (DJ Ntaprize). They created their first album as a Trio on 30 March 2014, \\"This Way to Elsewhere\\". This album included many featuring artists such as Bliss n Eso, Chance Waters, Vida Sunshyne, Mantra, K.I.K.I, etc. This album was produced by Martin Brown (Smiles Again) and Jon Reichardt. In December 2015 it was announced that Willow was leaving the group due to \\"creative differences\\". The creative differences he referred to, were that Smiles and manager Luke Girgis allegedly told him to \\"cut down on my spiritual/political content because they believe the majority can‚Äôt relate\\". He added ‚ÄúThat sort of thing goes against everything that I stand for and I simply can‚Äôt resonate with people on that wavelength‚Äù. These claims were denied by both Smiles and Luke.

Geology The Toroweap Fault, west of Aubrey Valley in the south, and of Prospect Valley in the northwest, formed the Aubrey Cliffs. The cliffs form part of the southwest perimeter of the Coconino Plateau. The Toroweap Fault separates from the Hurricane Fault-(Hurricane Cliffs), at the Colorado River, in the western Grand Canyon. Both faults continue northeast, and northwest into southern Utah. Geography The Aubrey Cliffs begin near Route 66 about five miles west of Seligman and run generally north to the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon (coordinates ranging from 35.35,-112.95 to 36.19, -113.02). The most prominent section is southern half, which overlooks the Aubrey Valley to the west and rises approximately above the valley floor to an elevation of about .

Desire, Following Desire and Sayuri Ichij≈ç: Wet Lust is a 1972 Japanese film in Nikkatsu's Roman porno series, directed by Tatsumi Kumashiro and starring the famous stripper Sayuri Ichij≈ç as herself, and co-starring Kazuko Shirakawa and Hiroko Isayama. Considered one of the best films in the series, in 1999 Japanese critics voted it one of the 100 best Japanese films of the 20th century. Synopsis Famous real-life stripper Sayuri Ichij≈ç appears as herself in this fictional account of her daily life. The story involves Ichij≈ç's relationships with two men: Her boyfriend, and the strip-club owner. Ichij≈ç considers her work in striptease to be an art-form and pushes the boundaries of legality. Harumi, a younger stripper determined to outdo Ichij≈ç, contributes to the ever-increasing extremity of the strip acts, which result in continuous problems with the police, and numerous arrests.Mosk. \\"Ichijo Sayuri: Nureta Yokujo\\".

It was also popular with critics. The mainstream Kinema Jumpo gave Tatsumi Kumashiro awards for Best Director and Best Screenplay for the year. Kinema Jumpo also gave Hiroko Isayama, who played Ichij≈ç's young stripper rival, the award for Best Actress.Johnson, p. 8, n. 13. Critics continue to hold the film in high esteem, and in 1999 the mainstream cinema journal Kinema Jumpo voted Ichijo's Wet Lust one of the 100 best Japanese films of the 20th century. Lead actress Sayuri Ichij≈ç has been singled out for praise for her performance in this film. A contemporary Variety review wrote that Ichij≈ç, \\"has grit, good-natured rebelliousness and a comic verve that raise the pic into a comedic drama that transcends its type and milieu for some regular as well as grind chances abroad...\\" Allmovie writes of lead actress Ichij≈ç, \\"Her brilliant and humorous performance, and her dedication to stripping... lift this picture out of the mainstream.\\" In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, the Weissers give the film three and a half out of four points, and write that Ichij≈ç \\"delivers another delightful performance here, especially in the highly erotic striptease numbers which include generous portions of candle-wax S&M;, bondage and perverse sexuality ...but no pubic hair.\\"Weisser, p. 205. Style and themes Ichijo's Wet Lust was director Tatsumi Kumashiro's second Roman Porno film. In depicting the life of a sex industry worker, the film fits into one of Kumashiro's recurring subjects, foreshadowed in his early, unsuccessful film Front Row Life (1968). Kumashiro's Wet Lust: Twenty One Strippers (1974) was an unofficial sequel to Ichijo's Wet Lust, and was even more successful than its predecessor.Sharp, p. 139.Weisser, p. 204. A later Kumashiro film with a real stripper playing herself in the title role is Madoka Mika: The Woman Who Wets Her Finger (1984).Sharp, p. 27-28. Sayuri Ichij≈ç had become notorious in 1970 for creating the tokudashi or \\"open stage\\" form of striptease. Ichij≈ç involved the audience in her act by passing out a magnifying glass, with which selected members of the audience were allowed to perform a \\"genital inspection\\" on the dancer. Much of Ichij≈ç's act is portrayed in the film, such as an elaborate strip routine in which she sheds a kimono with the use of a samurai sword. Other routines simulate lesbian masturbation, and show the stripper dripping hot wax on herself, and, afterward, soothing her skin with lemon.Sharp, p. 28.Johnson, p. 4. Because of the censorship of Japanese pornography, Ichij≈ç's most famous routine‚Äîthe \\"genital inspection\\"‚Äî could not be shown in the film. According to Film Quarterly, Kumashiro instead \\"conjures up the physicality of the vagina\\" in a scene in which Harumi, the stripping competitor, raises one leg and sprays milk onto the face of a mesmerized member of the audience.Johnson, pp. 5-6. Kumashiro's long battles against censorship are also part of the framework of the film. The women in the film are the objects of police attention, while the men who make a living off them and are entertained by them are left alone. Film Quarterly writes that Kumashiro portrays this situation, \\"without any hypocritical moralizing.\\"Johnson, p. 5. Ichij≈ç's troubles with the law are shown both in her arrests within the narrative of the film, and in a caption which informs the audience that Ichij≈ç was under prosecution for obscenity during the filming. Film Quarterly notes that Ichij≈ç's and Harumi's tokudashi performances, as presented in the film, can be seen by U.S. audiences as demeaning to women. It is pointed out that the actual Ichij≈ç fought for the right to do these performances as a form of freedom of expression. In the context of the film, Harumi's final tokudashi performance, in which she ejaculates on the face of the audience member, is seen as a form of triumph. Availability Ichijo's Wet Lust was released on home video in VHS format on December 12, 1988, and on DVD on July 27, 2001. It was re-released on DVD on December 22, 2006, as part of Geneon's sixth wave of Nikkatsu Roman porno series. On March 23, 2010, Kino International released three Tatsumi Kumashiro films on DVD in the U.S. Along with Twisted Path of Love (1972) and Yakuza Goddess: Lust and Honor (1973), they released Ichijo's Wet Lust under the title Sayuri Ichijo: Following Desire.

Archaeological excavations of an underground cemetery constructed at her tomb have shown that she was venerated at Bolsena by the fourth century. Life The existence of Christina herself is poorly attested. Some versions of her legend place her in Tyre (Phoenicia), other evidence points to Bolsena, an ancient town in central Italy, near an Etruscan site called Volsinium, with catacombs in which archeologists have found the remains of an early Christian church and the tomb of a female martyr. Inscriptions found on the site confirm that this martyr had a name like Christina and that the local community was venerating her as a saint by the end of the fourth century. Some corroborating evidence is provided by a sixth-century mosaic in the basilica of St. Apollinare Nuovo at Ravenna, which includes in its procession of virgins a saint named Christina, wearing a martyr's crown.Reames, Sherry L. ed., \\"Christina of Bolsena: Introduction\\", Middle English Legends of Women Saints, Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 2003  Life of Saint Christina  Christina is an early virgin Christian martyr. By the ninth century, an account of her martyrdom was composed, which developed many variants. According to these, she was born either in Tyre (Eastern stories) or in Persia (Western stories) during the 3rd century or 5th century. She was born into a rich family, and her father was governor of Tyre. By the age of 11 the girl was exceptionally beautiful, and many wanted to marry her. Christina's father, however, envisioned that his daughter should become a pagan priestess. To this end he placed her in a special dwelling where he had set up many gold and silver idols, and he commanded his daughter to burn incense before them. Two servants attended Christina. National Museum in Warsaw Martyrdom of St Christina San Zanipolo Venice, Italy. According to accounts, one time Christina was visited by an angel, who instructed her in the true faith. The angel called her a bride of Christ and told her about her future suffering. Christina smashed all the idols in her room and threw them out the window. In visiting his daughter, Christina's father, Urbanus, asked her where all the idols had disappeared. Christina was silent. Then, having summoned the servants, Urbanus learned the truth from them. Urbanus had his daughter tortured because of her faith, but God thwarted his efforts on several occasions. The nature of the torture varies with each telling, and can include iron hooks, grilling by fire, placement in a furnace, torture on the wheel, assault by snakes, assailment by arrows, and other assorted methods which she survives. After her father's death, his successor, Dion, continued to torture her. Christina is eventually beheaded.\\"St. Christina of Tyre, Martyr\\", Orthodox Church in America Catholic Church The entry for her in the 2004 Roman Martyrology is very brief: \\"At Bolsena in Tuscany, Saint Christina, Virgin and Martyr\\". She was once included in the General Roman Calendar. The Tridentine Calendar gave her a commemoration within the Mass of the Vigil of Saint James. When in 1955 Pope Pius XII suppressed this vigil,General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII the celebration of Saint Christina became a \\"simple\\" and in 1960 a \\"commemoration\\".General Roman Calendar of 1960 The 1969 revision omitted her from that calendar, \\"because nothing is known of this virgin and martyr apart from her name and her burial at Bolsena\\",\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 131 but not from the Martyrology, the official list of recognized saints. According to the present rules in the Roman Missal, Saint Christina may be celebrated with a \\"memorial\\" everywhere on her feast day, unless in some locality an obligatory celebration is assigned to that day.General Instruction of the Roman Missal , 355 c Relics Relic of Saint Christina at the Maronite Cathedral \\"Our Lady of the Seas\\" in Tyre, Lebanon Toffia in the Province of Rieti displays her relics in a transparent urn. Palermo, of which Christina is one of four patron saints, also claims to hold her relics. The Eastern tradition that connects Christina with Tyre, Lebanon may be due to confusion with the name of a locality near Bolsena. Contrary to local belief, Christina of Bolsena is not the saint whose remains are interred in The Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Cleveland, Ohio.StJohnCathedral.com‚Äô‚Äô, Website of the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, Cleveland, Ohio. Miracle of Bolsena A second legend is connected to Christina. The Eucharistic miracle, depicted in Raphael's The Mass at Bolsena, is often considered to be the catalyst for the Feast of Corpus Christi, recalls an event in the Umbrian region of Italy in 1263. A priest named Peter from the city of Prague nurtured doubts regarding the transubstantiation of the Host during Mass, and during his pilgrimage toward Rome prayed to be relieved of his questions. While saying the words of consecration in the Basilica of Santa Cristina at Bolsena, the Host dripped blood on his hands and on the cloth below.\\"Poetry, painting and procession\\" , Zenit, June 23, 2011 References * External links *Passio di Santa Cristina *Archidiocesis de Madrid: Santa Cristina *Catholic Online-Saints & Angels: St Christina * Category:3rd-century deaths Category:Sicilian saints Category:3rd-century Romans Category:3rd-century Christian saints Category:Italian saints Category:Christian child saints Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Angelic visionaries Category:Ante-Nicene Christian female saints ","title":"Christina of Bolsena"},{"id":"24417122","text":"McKendrick is an unincorporated community in Restigouche County, New Brunswick, Canada.New Brunswick Provincial Archives - McKendrick History Notable people See also *List of communities in New Brunswick References Category:Communities in Restigouche County, New Brunswick ","title":"McKendrick, New Brunswick"},{"id":"24417130","text":"Nemoderma is the only genus in the family Nemodermataceae and order Nemodermatales of the brown algae (class Phaeophyceae).

It was once home to one of the city's political leaders, and later a Presbyterian minister. Few extant buildings in the city can compare to it architecturally, and it has been named a historic site. William McCracken settled in Cambridge in 1809 at the age of twenty-two. Although he began his residency as a simple blacksmith, McCracken later made himself into one of the most prominent members of local society. McCracken arranged for the construction of the present house,Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 555-556. built in 1825, but his wealth was sufficient to pay for the erection of a brick house in the same neighborhood in 1830. Two years later, William McFarland was born in New Athens. At the age of twenty-five, he was ordained as a minister in one of the denominations that later formed the United Presbyterian Church of North America. McFarland moved to Cambridge in 1860 to pastor its United Presbyterian congregation, soon taking possession of the house, and it remained the property of the McFarland family until his daughter conveyed it to the Guernsey County Historical Society in 1966. Since that time, the society has converted the house into its museum. Greek Revival in style, the McCracken-McFarland House is a weatherboarded structure with a slate roof. It sits slightly above the sidewalk; one must climb two small sets of steps to attain the six-columned porch on the front of the house. Both stories of the facade are divided into five bays, with windows in all except for the center of the first story; this place is occupied by the main entrance, its transom light, and its sidelights. The gabled roof is topped with a chimney on either end of the roofline., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-02-26. Although the Greek Revival influence is present, the house is primarily a vernacular structure, retaining a settlement-period mode of design with few extant parallels in the city. In early 1979, the McCracken- McFarland House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and because of its place as the home of William McCracken. Among the other National Register-listed locations in Cambridge is the McCracken-Scott House, the brick house that William McCracken had built in 1830.

Her father, Yazdin, son of Mihrzbiroi, was the governor of Nisibis. She converted from Zoroastrianism to the Church of the East. She was killed for refusing to consummate her marriage to a nobleman, and was venerated as a virgin martyr.David Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church: A History of the Church of the East (East and West Publishing, 2011), p. 87. According to a Greek martyrology, she was beaten to death with rods. The exact date of her death is unknown, but it was probably during the reign of Khosrau I (531‚Äì579).Wilmshurst (2011), p. 494, puts her death around 600, but Fiey (2004) proposes she died much earlier (around 363). Not long after her death, Babai the Great (died 628) wrote her biography in Syriac. Today only the preface survives. Since Babai lists all the hagiographical works he had written up to that point in his biography of George of Izla (martyred 615), he must have written Christina's biography after that date. According to Babai, she was called Yazdoi \\"when she was pagan\\", but \\"in her new birth of adoption as a token of life, chose to be called Christina, a name that shall not pass\\". Christina is commemorated 13 March in the Catholic Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church. The Roman Martyrology describes her as follows: \\"In Persia, Saint Christina, martyr, who was flogged with rods and concluded the witness of martyrdom under King Chosroes I of the Persians.\\"\\"Martyrologium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 ) In the Georgian Orthodox Church, her feast day was 15 March in the early 7th century. Some versions of the 10th-century church calendar of Ioane-Zosime, however, giver it as 14 March.Christina-Yazdoi, martyr in Persia, The Cult of Saints in Late Antiquity (University of Oxford, 2017).

He had dreams of being a stand up comedian. He raced motocross as a teenager, but he stopped when he found out he had hemophilia. He had a major accident on an icy sidewalk that put him in the hospital for many weeks. He worked as a copy editor for \\"Mathematical Review,\\" a bibliographic journal for mathematicians, physicists, statisticians, logicians, historians, and philosophers of mathematics. While he is best known for his poetry, he also wrote criticism and a memoir, Codeine Diary: True Confessions of a Reckless Hemophiliac.

As professor Susannah Mintz puts it in her article Lyric Bodies: Poets on Disability and Masculinity, published in PMLA in March 2012, \\"the speaker [of the title poem in The Hemophiliac's Motorcycle] presents himself as paradoxical: at risk and highly skilled, competitive and communal, worthy of respect for his talent and potentially feared or derided for the strange behavior of so metaphorically charged a substance as his blood.\\" Personal life Andrews married Carrie Garlinghouse in the late 1980s.

He is also known as the husband of the goddess Hina. HinaBeckwith (1970): p.12 Some have taken this to suggest a complementary dualism, as the word k≈´ in the Hawaiian language means \\"to stand\\" while one meaning of hina is \\"to fall\\".Pukui et al.

Hina's counterpart in New Zealand for example, is Hina, associated with the moon, rather than Hinga, \\"fallen down\\".

Glamour photography is a genre of photography in which the subjects are portrayed in erotic poses ranging from fully clothed to nude. The term may be a euphemism for erotic photography. For glamour models, body shape and size are directly related to success. This type of photography is colloquially known as \\"cheesecake\\" for women and \\"beefcake\\" for men.dictionary.reference.comRosenberg, David (12 April 2015). slate.com; \\"The Secret History of Hunky Male Beefcakes\\". Glamour photography is generally a composed image of a subject in a still position. The subjects of \\"glamour\\" photography for professional use are often professional models, and the photographs are normally intended for commercial use, including mass-produced calendars, pinups and men's magazines such as Maxim; but amateur subjects are also sometimes used, and sometimes the photographs are intended for private and personal use only. Photographers use a combination of cosmetics, lighting and airbrushing techniques to produce an appealing image of the subject. (As cited by ProQuest .) Publisher's website. Early history Until the later half of the 20th century glamour photography was usually referred to as erotic photography. Early erotic photography was often associated with \\"French postcards\\", small postcard sized images, that were sold by street vendors in France. In the early 1900s the pinup became popular and depicted scantily dressed women, often in a playful pose, seemingly surprised or startled by the viewer. The subject would usually have an expression of delight which seemed to invite the viewer to come and play. During World War II pin-up pictures of scantily clad movie stars were extremely popular among American servicemen. Betty Grable was one of the most famous pin-up models of all time; her pinup in a bathing suit was extremely popular with World War II soldiers. In December 1953, Marilyn Monroe was featured in the first issue of Playboy magazine. Bettie Page was the Playboy Playmate of the Month in January 1955. Playboy was the first magazine featuring nude erotic photography to receive mainstream attention. Penthouse was the second such magazine to achieve this. The \\"British Queen of Curves\\" in the 1950s and early sixties was Pamela Green. Harrison Marks, on the encouragement of Green, took up glamour photography and together in 1957 they published the pinup magazine Kamera. Currently in England the earliest use of the word glamour as a euphemism for nude modeling or photography is attributed to Marks' publicity material in 1950s. Glamour models popular in the early 1990s included Hope Talmons and Dita Von Teese and the modern era is represented in the U.S. by models like Heidi Van Horne and Bernie Dexter, while leading representatives of the genre in the UK include Katie Price and Lucy Pinder. Magazines and movie stars Standards and styles of glamour photography change over time, reflecting for example changes in social acceptance and taste. In the early 1920s, United States photographers like Ruth Harriet Louise and George Hurrell photographed celebrities to glamorize their stature by utilizing lighting techniques to develop dramatic effects. Until the 1950s, glamour photography in advertising and in men's magazines was highly controversial or even illegal. In some countries, if not illegal, such magazines could not be on public display, and some had to be displayed in a plastic cover. Magazines featuring glamour photography were sometimes marketed as \\"art magazines\\" or \\"health magazines\\". Popular portraiture Since the 1990s glamour photography has increased in popularity among the public. Glamour portrait studios have opened, offering professional hair and makeup artists and professional retouching to allow the general public to have the \\"model\\" experience. These sometimes include boudoir portraits but are more commonly used by professionals and high school seniors who want to look their best for their portraits.

Bradford. The film stars Dorie Barton, Joey Lawrence and Chad Allen. The plot follows six friends on a retreat, where they are stalked by a killer in a black cloak and rubber mask. The film was panned by critics and audiences alike for being a ripoff of I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), another slasher released four years earlier. Plot A male college student receives a note under his dorm door that says \\"do you wanna know a secret?\\" He assumes it is from his girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton). He goes into the hallway to find her and is killed by someone in a mask. One year later Beth, her new boyfriend Hank (Joey Lawrence), and her friends Oz (Thomas Anthony Jones), Tina (Leonora Scelfo), Nellie (Elsie Escobar) and Brad (Chad Allen) go on their spring break vacation in Florida. The first night Brad tries to hit on Beth, but she tells them that they are just friends. Brad is attacked on a sailboat while the others are in the house. His bloody shirt is found in the water, though his body is missing. The group sees a message on his computer: \\"do you wanna know a secret?\\" The following night, a drunken Tina kisses Hank. Beth refuses to talk to him until the next night when he saves her from getting roofied at a nightclub. Beth goes outside the club for air, where she witnesses the boy who tried to drug her being murdered by someone in a mask. When the police arrive, they find \\"do you wanna know a secret?\\" is carved in the boy's back. An FBI agent (Jeff Conaway) tells the group not to leave the house, as they are all suspects for both murders. The next day, Oz is attacked in the kitchen while Beth and Hank are showering. Outside at the pool, Tina's throat has been slit while Nellie swims. When she finishes she is attacked from behind, has her throat slit as well and is thrown in the pool. Oz regains consciousness, and sees the same message written on the wall in blood. He runs outside to find both Nellie and Tina dead. Oz is arrested by the police for the murders. At the precinct, the officer who arrested Oz is in the bathroom when he sees the message on the wall. He is then murdered by the masked figure. Oz is released. Beth is waiting outside the police station when she sees a truck drive by. The driver is wearing the mask she remembers from the murder at the club. Hank is nowhere to be found, so she follows the truck out to the glades and waits for Oz to meet up with her. Oz and Beth search for the killer in the dark woods. They are separated and Oz is knocked out from behind. He wakes up in the basement of a church and hears Beth's scream. Upstairs in the church Beth is tied up in a wedding dress and blindfolded. The killer removes Beth's blindfold and his mask, revealing himself as Brad. Beth sees that the dead bodies of Tina, Nellie, and the pastor are set up in the pews, as if watching. Brad starts cutting Beth's dress open with a knife, when Oz shows up. Brad and Oz fight but Brad wins and ties Oz up again. Beth asks Brad why he murdered everyone. Brad explains that the secret is he loves Beth so much he would do anything, including staging his own death and killing all the others. He then holds up Hank's severed head. Beth secretly unties her hands and attacks Brad. He knocks her to the ground but Oz gets untied and attacks Brad. As Brad is about to kill Oz, Beth stabs him through his entire body. As Oz and Beth exit the church, Brad jumps up again and is shot by the FBI agent. The agent reveals that the dead pastor was also Brad's father. Reception Jeremy Wheeler of the online film database Allmovie awarded the film one star out of five, noting that the poor acting and lack of gore stating the acting is \\"acting about as good as the Price Is Right showgirls, at the very least the flick could fall back on is its scares and bloody gore...Unfortunately there isn't any. Yes, yet another modern slasher that doesn't deliver on the goods -- the only reason the people are watching this junk in the first place (besides the actor's relatives)\\".

It takes place in an alternate-history 1950s, where the creatures from Golden Age monster movies are played by real monsters who lead otherwise normal lives. Controlling reporters Sue Bergman and Ron Ashman, the player seeks to unravel a mystery surrounding the murder of Frankenstein's monster. In the process, the player undertakes a globetrotting journey to locations like Transylvania and Egypt, while solving puzzles and interacting with characters such as Count Dracula, the Invisible Man and the Mummy. Development of Hollywood Monsters began at Pendulo in mid-1994. The company sought to heavily improve its design practices, graphics production and engine technology over those of its first game, Igor: Objective Uikokahonia (1994). While Igor had involved six people, Hollywood Monsters required roughly 40 contributors, most of them outside contractors. Pendulo's goal was to create a traditional adventure game with nonlinear gameplay and difficult puzzles. At the request of Dinamic, the team worked with Spanish new wave group La Uni√≥n to create a theme song for Hollywood Monsters. After a challenging development cycle that lasted two-and- a-half years, the game was released in Spain during December 1997. The game drew attention in Spain as a major release from the country's small game industry, which had collapsed after the golden age of Spanish software. Spanish publications cited it as evidence that domestic games were maturing; listeners of the popular radio program Game 40 voted it the best Spanish-made game of 1997. In Spain, Hollywood Monsters sold 250,000 units and helped to establish Pendulo as an important developer. However, the game's planned English version was never released, as Pendulo failed to find publishers beyond Southern Europe. The game has retrospectively been labeled a \\"classic\\" by Spanish outlets, and as one of the country's greatest graphic adventure games. Longstanding fan demand led to the spiritual successor The Next Big Thing (2011), named Hollywood Monsters 2 in Spain. Gameplay As Sue, the player highlights the \\"Look\\" option and the manor door. Hollywood Monsters is a graphic adventure game in which the player collects items, converses with non-player characters and solves puzzles. The player maneuvers the player character through the game world via a point-and-click interface, mousing over the screen and selecting hotspots with which to interact. At the bottom of the screen, a pop-up menu allows the player to pick one of seven actions, including \\"Talk\\" and \\"Look\\", and mouse over an appropriate hotspot, such as a door or character. This creates a verb-noun combination in the message line at the bottom of the screen; \\"Look door\\" or \\"Talk Joseph\\", for example. The player may then execute the action with a button press. As an example, executing \\"Talk Joseph\\" will begin a dialogue tree. An eighth action‚Äî\\"Go\\", for moving the player character‚Äîis automatically enabled when no other action is chosen. Hollywood Monsters features a nonlinear system of progression, although the player character cannot die or reach a dead-end state. After the opening sequence, the player may travel to most of the game's areas unimpeded. The game contains roughly 50 characters and 120 collectible items. Once taken, items are stored in a pop-up inventory, and may be combined with each other to create new objects. The player employs items from the inventory to solve puzzles; for example, giving a glass of punch to a doorman as a distraction. Other types of puzzles in Hollywood Monsters include those based on timed action, on conversations, on pixel hunting and on repeating the same action multiple times. Setting and story Hollywood Monsters takes place in an alternate-history 1950s, where the monsters from Golden Age monster movies exist in the real world and live everyday lives. These characters work in Hollywood as actors. Movie monsters recreated in the game include the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man, Count Dracula and Frankenstein's monster. Hollywood Monsters portrayal of Hollywood has been described as a parody, and the game directly lampoons famous films such as the 1931 Frankenstein starring Boris Karloff. As the game starts, reporter Sue Bergman of The Quill sets out to cover the Film Academy Awards Ceremony for Monster Actors, held in Hollywood. The event is a major gathering of Hollywood's monster talent at the residence of film producer Otto Hannover; Sue's goal is to interview the attendees. There, she notices that Frankenstein's monster (\\"Frankie\\") is distressed and searching for the Invisible Man, so she attempts to interview him. However, Sue is then kidnapped and Frankie is cut apart. The following day, Quill reporter Ron Ashman learns that Frankie and Sue have disappeared. He returns to Hannover's residence to look for evidence, after which he attempts to find Sue and revive Frankie. It is revealed that Frankie's body parts were hidden inside the trophies given to the previous night's winners: the Mummy, the Wolf Man and Count Dracula. As Frankie had witnessed Sue's kidnapping, he must be reassembled to solve the mystery. Ron proceeds to undertake a journey around the world. The Mummy resides in Egypt, while Dracula lives in Transylvania's Mountains. Other visitable locations include Switzerland, Scotland and Australia. Ron completes a series of favors to obtain the trophies from their owners, such as aiding in Count Dracula's attempt to lose weight. In a Swiss lab, Ron rebuilds Frankie, who reveals that he had overheard a plot by Hannover and his associate Dr. Karloff against Hollywood's monster actors. The pair hopes to replace them with body doubles that can be easily controlled. Ron returns to Los Angeles and helps Sue to escape from Hannover's captivity, but the pair is soon ambushed by the producer and Dr. Karloff. The villains explain that the real monsters have already been replaced, as they had grown independent and had increased their fees; their doubles are mindless servants. Ron ultimately defeats Hannover and, alongside Sue, breaks the story of his plan and frees the real monsters. Development Origins Spanish developer Pendulo Studios began Hollywood Monsters in mid-1994, directly after the launch of Igor: Objective Uikokahonia, the company's debut adventure game. Pendulo had announced plans for another adventure title before Igors release; art director Rafael Latiegui said that it was \\"very clear [to us] that we were going to make\\" more games in the genre. Because co-founder Miguel Angel Ramos had left the team after its first project, the company's three remaining core members‚ÄîLatiegui, Felipe G√≥mez Pinilla and Ram√≥n Hern√°ez‚Äîgathered to brainstorm their second game. The trio sought to diverge from the design process used in Igor, whose whole production Latiegui later called \\"absolutely amateurish\\". The central idea upon which Hern√°ez, Pinilla and Latiegui agreed was to make a \\"classic\\" adventure game, including a high level of interactivity, a visual look akin to animated films, a comedic tone and a lack of player death. Hern√°ez and Latiegui disliked the trends in graphic adventure games at the time, especially what Hern√°ez saw as an overreliance on cutscenes. Pendulo \\"wanted to run away from anything like an interactive movie\\", according to Pinilla. For the plot, the team conceived a story about movie monsters from the Golden Age of Hollywood, set around the 1940s and 1950s. Pinilla said that the designers \\"had the idea of going against all the preconceived notions\\" in the public mind about such characters. Pendulo's co-founders developed the Hollywood Monsters script full-time for between three and six months. This process was collaborative: Pinilla noted that the three leads held equal weight in decision-making. The script ultimately detailed all of the puzzles, dialogue, characters, areas and objects set to appear in the game. Pendulo opted for a \\"very open, non-linear\\" design that emphasized player freedom, according to Latiegui. He, Pinilla and Hern√°ez also purposely increased the difficulty of Hollywood Monsters puzzles compared to those in Igor: they saw their first title as overly short and easy, and hoped to remedy these issues in their next game. Hern√°ez cited the then-new project's large size as another aspect of its increased difficulty. The team estimated an average playtime of around 100 hours for Hollywood Monsters, according to PC Man√≠a. Production Pendulo began developing Hollywood Monsters with the same game engine used by Igor: Objective Uikokahonia, a project coded in Pascal. However, the team's concerns with engine quality led to two full rewrites of Hollywood Monsters underlying technology during production. After finishing Igor, Pendulo upgraded that title's codebase for use in the developer's future projects. This new version employed protected mode and offered support for voice-overs, enhanced scrolling, a 320x200 screen resolution and other features. Nevertheless, competing adventure games began to outpace Pendulo's older code, according to Ram√≥n Hern√°ez. In response, the team chose to rewrite the engine again, which resulted in the final version used in Hollywood Monsters. The engine that ultimately shipped with the game, built to support SVGA and a resolution of 640x480, was coded from the ground up in C. In 1997, Felipe G√≥mez Pinilla summarized that \\"quite a lot of time\\" had been dedicated to engine development for Hollywood Monsters. As with the engine and game design, Pendulo \\"started from scratch\\" in the creation of Hollywood Monsters animated graphics, according to Pinilla. The company began production of the visuals by concepting the environments and key objects, while seeking an art style that suited the team's goals. MeriStations Jordi Espunya reported that Pendulo settled on a stylistic direction inspired by Spanish comics, in particular their use of esperpento and satirical imagery. All backgrounds, characters and other art assets were designed on paper first, then realized digitally. The developer hired graphic artists and background painters to fill out the art staff as production ramped up. Including the voice cast, roughly 40 people contributed to Hollywood Monsters, most of them outside contractors. Hern√°ez said that managing the large number of contributors was the \\"most important change\\" to Pendulo's development process since Igor, which had involved six people. Hollywood Monsters backgrounds took roughly one year to complete. As the art team worked on the backgrounds, it added unplanned visual red herrings for the game's puzzles; Rafael Latiegui noted that Pendulo was \\"amused by the idea of getting people a little dizzy with some false trail[s]\\". The Spanish new wave band La Uni√≥n (pictured in 2015) contributed the theme song to Hollywood Monsters. During development, Hollywood Monsters publisher Dinamic Multimedia suggested a plan to hire a well-known band to compose music for the game. Pendulo was uncertain at first about whom to contact, but ultimately settled on the Spanish new wave group La Uni√≥n. According to Latiegui, the team \\"thought that [La Uni√≥n] could do a good job and that their style fit the game very well\\". Dinamic subsequently worked with La Uni√≥n's record label to secure a deal, and the band composed the main theme for Hollywood Monsters, \\"Enigmas\\". Latiegui said in late 1997 that the collaboration had gone smoothly and that La Uni√≥n had \\"got[ten] along very well\\" with the team. In 2002, La Uni√≥n similarly recalled that working on Hollywood Monsters had been \\"a very fun experience\\", and reported that it was pleased with the results of the collaboration. In retrospect, Pendulo labeled Hollywood Monsters a difficult project. The team found it to be a significantly greater challenge than Igor had been, and reported that resources were tight during production. It ultimately required a long production cycle of around two and a half years. Pinilla told Game 40 that development would have gone faster with more contributors, but that it was \\"impossible to have more people.\\" Spain's game development industry had collapsed after the golden age of Spanish software in the 8-bit era: Francisco Delgado of Microman√≠a cited Hollywood Monsters as one of the few Spanish-made games under production in 1997. While Latiegui was hopeful that Spain's fortunes were turning around, Hern√°ez remarked that \\"we are [still] quite far from countries like England, France or the United States.\\" According to Espunya, there was a consensus in 1997 that Spanish adventure game development had no future, although he saw Hollywood Monsters as a hopeful sign. Distribution and sales Dinamic Multimedia first published Hollywood Monsters in Spain during December 1997. It launched at a low price point of 2,995 pesetas (‚Ç¨18), made possible via inexpensive packaging and the use of a WinHelp file to replace much of the manual. While there were doubts in Spain about the sales potential of graphic adventure titles at the time, Rafael Latiegui noted that his company believed Hollywood Monsters low cost and \\"high quality\\" would spread the game via word of mouth. The plan ultimately worked, and the title became a hit. Spanish retailer Centro Mail still reported Hollywood Monsters as its fourth best-selling computer game during the first half of May 1998. It continued to hold in the store's top 10 consistently through May, June, July and the first half of August. The title's 1998 Italian release was similarly popular, according to Latiegui, and Dinamic debuted a second edition of the game in Spain during May 1999. David Navarro of MarcaPlayer wrote that Hollywood Monsters performance in Southern Europe was \\"a success comparable to the best in the genre.\\" Around the time of the game's launch in Spain, Latiegui told MeriStation that game development in his country \\"is not profitable unless it can be amortized beyond our borders.\\" Although Igor: Objective Uikokahonia had failed to break into the international market, Pendulo had intended Hollywood Monsters from the start to reach a global audience. Felipe G√≥mez Pinilla noted that the newer game had been developed with English as its primary language; the Spanish-language dub was still in production by October 1997. However, because of a lack of interest from publishers, Pendulo was unable to secure a release for Hollywood Monsters in the United States. In 2000, Latiegui explained that the game \\"was released in the worst moment in time for adventure games and the companies didn't want to risk their money.\\" Ultimately, Pendulo launched Hollywood Monsters only in Spain and Italy, which continued the company's lack of global market success. In February 2002, Hollywood Monsters was announced as part of El Mundos 2002 \\"Los Mejores Videojuegos del Mundo\\" (MVM) collection, games that the newspaper included with its Sunday edition as optional purchases for ‚Ç¨5 each. The paper had incorporated Igor into a similar promotion during 1998. Because Dinamic Multimedia had gone bankrupt since the debut of Hollywood Monsters, Pendulo partnered with FX Interactive for the re-release, which came in a special case with a set of stickers. Pendulo noted that fans had \\"for some time ... been insisting on the possibility of making a collector's edition of Hollywood Monsters\\"; the game had become difficult to find in Spain since the closure of its original publisher. The 2002 MVM collection was a success: combined sales of its 10 games, including Hollywood Monsters, reached one million units. FX subsequently brought the game back to store shelves as part of its budget-priced \\"Premium\\" line in mid-2002. The following year, Spain's GameLive PC reported that Hollywood Monsters was still \\"sell[ing] well six years after its launch.\\" According to HobbyConsolas, lifetime sales of Hollywood Monsters in Spain alone totaled 250,000 units by 2011. A writer for MarcaPlayer summarized it at the time as \\"one of the most played and best- selling adventures in Spanish software\\" history. Reception Hollywood Monsters drew attention in Spain as a major release from the country's struggling game industry. PC Man√≠as Jaime Bono and PC Top Players Daniel Melguizo both cited the project as evidence that Spanish games were coming of age; the latter compared it to the successful PC F√∫tbol in this regard, and highlighted Hollywood Monsters technical superiority over domestic competitors like Dr√°scula. Similarly, David E. Garcia of Microman√≠a hailed the game as Spain's \\"best graphic adventure ever\\", and as the country's first \\"graphic adventure able to rub shoulders with the big ones\\". The game often attracted comparisons to LucasArts' Maniac Mansion. Hollywood Monsters won the 1997 \\"Best Spanish Game\\" award from the radio program Game 40, as voted by listeners. Hosts Guillem Caball√© and Manuel Mart√≠n Vivaldi likewise named it their favorite Spanish game of 1997. The former host joked that his choice was based entirely on the scene in which Ron Ashman kicks a girl holding daisies into a river. Discussing the visuals in Hollywood Monsters, Bono and Melguizo offered praise, while Garcia wrote that the game's \\"presentation is simply magnificent.\\" The reviewer for S√≥lo Juegos similarly complimented the graphics in Hollywood Monsters‚Äîdespite the \\"outdated\\", \\"neglected\\" interface‚Äîand echoed Garcia's and Melguizo's approval of the voice acting. Conversely, Jordi Espunya of MeriStation called the voices uneven and cited several \\"terrible\\" performances among the good ones; and he argued that the graphics, although above average, were inferior to those of foreign titles like The Curse of Monkey Island. Regarding the puzzles, C√©sar Otero of MeriStation later said that they \\"cause[d] schisms among adventurers, with those who defend[ed] their madness and those who condemn[ed] the absurdity of their solutions.\\" While Garcia found Hollywood Monsters puzzles logical, and Melguizo praised their \\"tight difficulty\\", Espunya called them frustrating and recommended the game primarily to genre veterans as a result. S√≥lo Juegoss reviewer fell in between: while highlighting the game's length and \\"many\\" sensible puzzles, the writer felt that certain moments \\"are not as logical as the game promises.\\" In 2003, Just Adventures Michal Necasek sided with Espunya on the puzzles, and found Hollywood Monsters visuals \\"adequate\\" but its sound quality low. He summarized the game as \\"well done though not excellent\\". Legacy Writing for HobbyConsolas, Clara Casta√±o Ruiz stated that Hollywood Monsters became \\"a benchmark for the development of graphic adventures in Spain\\". The game proceeded to maintain a longstanding reputation in the country, and has retrospectively been labeled a \\"classic\\" by Spanish outlets such as Vandal, 3DJuegos, Defconplay and MeriStation. In 2001, GameLive PC declared Hollywood Monsters \\"without a doubt [one of] the two best graphic adventures\\" ever developed in Spain. In the 2010s, HobbyConsolas likewise named Hollywood Monsters one of the greatest Spanish graphic adventure games; Ruiz wrote that it was \\"considered one of the best point-and-click graphic adventures in history\\". VidaExtra listed the game among the greatest adventure titles worldwide by 2015, while Defconplay named it one of Spain's best games in any genre by 2016. A writer for the former website opined that, if the game had been released by LucasArts, its reputation as a classic would extend internationally. In 2016, BuzzFeed Spain editor Guillermo del Palacio named the scene between Ron Ashman and the girl with the daisies one of \\"13 mythical moments\\" recognizable to adventure game fans. MeriStations C√©sar Otero recalled it as one of \\"the most disgraceful moments of humor in history\\", but nevertheless still amusing. As a greater commercial and critical success than Igor: Objective Uikokahonia, Hollywood Monsters marked a turning point for Pendulo Studios. It has been cited by publications such as PC Actual, 3DJuegos, Defconplay, Vandal and MeriStation as the title that put Pendulo on the map. Francisco Delgado of Microman√≠a wrote in 2011 that Hollywood Monsters \\"was the game that really brought fame and the mass market to\\" the developer, while Xan Pita of El Mundo remarked, \\"Thanks to this game, ... Pendulo made a good dent in the industry.\\" A writer for MeriStation named Hollywood Monsters the beginning of Pendulo's signature cartoon visual style, which it proceeded to carry throughout the rest of its work. Pendulo went on to become an important Spanish game developer, particularly in the adventure genre. It followed Hollywood Monsters with the Runaway trilogy‚ÄîRunaway: A Road Adventure, Runaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle and Runaway: A Twist of Fate‚Äîwhich brought the company international success. In 2011, MarcaPlayer dubbed Pendulo \\"the masters of the graphic adventure\\". Likewise, Ruiz wrote in 2017 that Pendulo had become \\"synonymous with graphic adventures in Spain\\" and one of the country's \\"most important studios\\". Successor In early 1998, Rafael Latiegui left open the possibility of a Hollywood Monsters sequel if the first game's sales and reception were strong enough. He told MeriStation that \\"we have a lot of ideas left [over] that were not possible to put in Hollywood Monsters\\" because of time constraints. Pendulo Studios soon began working on a second Hollywood Monsters, but the project changed shape to become Runaway: A Road Adventure, which started to form as an idea in summer 1998. Nevertheless, Latiegui said during Runaways development that Pendulo was still considering Hollywood Monsters 2. In 2001, he remarked that Pendulo had produced \\"a very fun script\\" for the sequel that was \\"full of familiar characters and others to get to know, with great humor and a great pre- design\\". It remained a tentative project at that time. Later in the year, Pendulo encountered serious financial trouble due to the 2001 bankruptcy of publisher Dinamic Multimedia, which hampered Runaways initial launch in Spain. Most of Pendulo's staff was laid off following Dinamic's closure, and Pendulo discontinued all game development. Thereafter, the developer spent a year trying to obtain the rights to release Runaway internationally. Pendulo managed to hold out and make Runaway a hit across Europe, which stabilized the company. The team then continued the Runaway series in part because of the first entry's success. According to Latiegui, the \\"vast majority\\" of those laid off returned for Runaway 2. However, fan requests for a sequel to Hollywood Monsters were ongoing throughout the creation of the Runaway trilogy. Latiegui said of the situation, \\"To each new game that we have been making, the reaction of the Spanish public has been the same: 'When is the next Hollywood Monsters?' \\" This pressure from fans became a key motivation for the team to return to the Hollywood Monsters concept. In April 2010, Pendulo and publisher Focus Home Interactive announced The Next Big Thing. Commentators from Adventure Gamers and Jeux Video noted the project's close similarity to Hollywood Monsters, and in April 2011 the game was retitled Hollywood Monsters 2 in Spain. At the start, Pendulo conceived The Next Big Thing as a high-definition remake of Hollywood Monsters, but it increasingly drifted from this framework over time. Designer and writer Josu√© Monchan came to the conclusion that the original game's puzzle design and nonlinear structure did not hold up to modern standards. As a result, Pendulo created something that \\"is not a second part, nor a remake\\", Latiegui explained. Rather, the team borrowed heavily from Hollywood Monsters and attempted to take its ideas in new directions. Sue Bergman and Ron Ashman were removed in favor of new protagonists: reporters Dan Murray and Liz Allaire of The Quill. As with Hollywood Monsters, The Next Big Thing takes place in a fantasy version of Hollywood where monsters act in films. The story explores the film industry's shift away from monster movies, which threatens to leave their casts out of work. Pendulo tried to imbue the game with a feminist outlook; Monchan called Hollywood Monsters \\"a bit male chauvinist\\" in retrospect. The Next Big Thing launched in the United States on April 21, 2011. In late 2012, it received an iOS release under the name Hollywood Monsters.

He served as Bishop of Wilmington from 1960 until his death in 1967. Biography Michael Hyle was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to John and Elizabeth (n√©e McCloskey) Hyle. He attended St. Charles College in Catonsville, Maryland and afterwards St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree in 1922. He then furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical North American College and the Urban College of Propaganda, earning a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1926. He was ordained to the priesthood on March 12, 1927. After doing pastoral work in Washington, D.C. from 1927 to 1943, he served as pastor in Libertytown, Maryland (1943‚Äì1946),St. Peter the Apostle Catholic Church, Libertytown, Maryland-History Bradshaw, Maryland (1946‚Äì1957), and in Baltimore (1957‚Äì1958). On July 3, 1958, Hyle was appointed Coadjutor Bishop, with right of succession, of Wilmington, Delaware, and Titular Bishop of Christopolis by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 24 at the Basilica of the Assumption (Baltimore) from Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, with Archbishop Albert Gregory Meyer and Bishop Jerome Aloysius Sebastian serving as co-consecrators. As coadjutor, he also served as vicar general of the diocese and pastor of Christ Our King Church.

As Hardwicke Island separates two channels offering passages between Vancouver Island and the mainland coast of British Columbia, Yorke Island was strategically placed to protect the entrances of what was considered the backdoor access to Vancouver during World War II.  History  Up at the Yorke Island Battery Then In 1938 Major Treatt of the Canada War Department, inspected the west coast of Canada and determined suitable locations for coastal defences. Yorke Island was determined to be a suitable site. The site was equipped with two 4.7\\" Quick firing guns, later replaced by two 6\\" Mk7 guns on Mk 2 mounting (transferred from the Stanley Park Battery). Also fitted was a 6 pdr Hotchkiss \\"examination gun\\". Anti-aircraft defence was provided by two 40mm Bofors guns at two different sites. In all three 800 million carbon arc searchlights were positioned to maintain a night fighting ability. In addition examination vessels, nicknamed the \\"Gumboot Navy\\" due to the use of fishing vessels and their crew, were on station to assist the fort in examining all passing traffic. Yorke Finished Then Approximately 60 buildings were built to support the garrison. A major challenge with Yorke Island was a lack of drinking water. Water was at first supplied by Union Steam ships while dropping off construction materials. After this was determined to be to inefficient, a scow with a large tank was brought in to fill the 50000 gallon cement water tank via the nearest creek on Hardwicke Island. Filling this tank and its challenges led to the only death on Yorke, Gnr Brunt, when the skiff he and others were on was swamped returning from a maintenance trip to Hardwicke Island. Brunt's leg tangled in the boat tow line and he was lost when it sank. Efforts to recover him were not successful. Yorke Island was an isolated post which combined with lack of action, the advent of the conscript act, and minimal contact with locals lead to some discipline issues, nicknamed \\"Going Yorkie\\". Segregation was also a difficulty: some men served on the island at the same time did not meet until reunions were arranged well after the war. As the threat of attack diminished the garrison was decommissioned and the fort was abandoned by early 1946.  Today  Yorke Today Although the fort is abandoned, Yorke Island itself is now a Conservancy protected under BC Parks. Recent efforts by volunteers and local groups have now allowed for a major cleanup at the fort. Trails have been cut and marked to areas of safe access and interest. Extensive remnants of the bunkers, gun emplacements, and buildings are accessible when one is on the island. Hobbyists with metal detectors are strongly cautioned against using them on the island due to the possibility of live ordinances left over from training purposes during the war. Safely accessing the island is a difficult and sometimes dangerous journey due to dangerous tides and winds. The safest access is in Courtenay Bay due to its protection from extreme flood and tidal action compared to the conditions found on the beach side near to the dock built in World War II. Explorers of the Island are strongly cautioned against random landings on the shore of the Island due to the prevalence of still effective barbed wire over most of the perimeter. The dock built in World War II was dismantled, meaning Courtney Bay offers safest access to those requiring anchorage. There are no operators with permits to conduct tours of Yorke Island on shore at this time. Visitors should also be aware that there are no hidden rooms, bunkers, ordinance rooms, or anything other than what can be found out in plain site on the island. Recent visits have shown the use of ground penetrating radar (Suzie Guns) and damage to walls and floors in the main bunker trying to find these rooms as reported in an inaccurate Urban Exploration posting. Research shows the entire fort built on bedrock, with final construction involving over 100,000 cubic feet of concrete.

Gameplay Burning Rival gameplay screenshot In Burning Rival, the player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, then a \\"double KO\\" or \\"draw game\\" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match. Unlike the Street Fighter franchise and some other fighting games and franchises, there are no bonus rounds added to the game.

Following days of heavy clashes, the Houthis managed to capture the entire Sadah governorate including its provincial capital and establishes an independent administration, thereby marking the first such Yemeni governorate to fell out from central government control since the nationwide uprising began in 2011. Background In February 2011, after the success of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution and Tunisian Revolution, the Arab Spring spread to many countries including Yemen. The Houthis, officially known as Ansar Allah, declared their support for the 2011 Yemeni uprising against Ali Abdullah Saleh and large crowds of Houthi followers joined the protests on their 10th day.Press TV Houthis join protests in north Yemen, February 22, 2011 During February and March, thousands of protesters held weekly marches in Sa'dah city from the gates of the old city to the security barracks of Saleh's army.Yemeni Uprising Opens a Door to Besieged Rebels in the North, December 16, 2011 Meanwhile, skirmish clashes reportedly broke out as early as January on the outskirts of Sa'dah city between the Houthis and the Al Abdin tribe led by Sheikh Uthman Mujalli, a vocal anti-Houthi tribal leader. Mujalli was also a parliamentary representative from Sa'dah governorate representing the ruling General People‚Äôs Congress party. A few weeks after the clashes started, the student protest movement that began in the capital Sana'a soon spread to other parts of Yemen. Houthi rebels then began laying siege to Mujalli and his followers.

Early life In 1932, Origlass joined the Communist Party of Australia (CPA), which was then aligned with Stalin's USSR. Expelled soon after, he became involved in the Trotskyist movement. He joined the Workers Party in 1934 and by 1937 was its leading figure. The Workers Party merged into the Communist League of Australia in 1938. Career In 1940, Origlass started working at Mort's Dock in Sydney's Balmain shipyards. He was elected as a shop steward with the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia. Together with fellow Trotskyists Laurie Short and Jim McClelland, he battled with the CPA-dominated leadership of the union. After Hitler's invasion of the USSR in 1941, the CPA supported the Australian war effort, but the Trotskyists did not. In 1941, the Communist League was banned by the Australian government because of its anti-war stance. In 1942, Origlass started publishing a newspaper called The Socialist to propagandise for Trotskyism. The struggle in the union culminated in 1945 when the leadership removed Origlass from his position as a shop steward. The Balmain waterfront responded by going on strike against the union, and Origlass was re-instated. Short and McClelland left the Trotskyist movement soon afterwards, becoming prominent figures in the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Short became national secretary of the union in 1951, defeating the CPA's Ernie Thornton after a bitter legal battle.Daphne Gollan, \\"The Balmain ironworkers' strike of 1945\\" in Labour History, 1972, 23‚Äì41.

In 1958 he was elected to Leichhardt Council for the ALP. A decade later he was expelled from the ALP but re-elected to the council on an \\"Independent Labor\\" ticket.

Evolution of the Regions Originally the city of Rome had been divided by Augustus into 14 regions in 7 BC. Then sometime during the 4th century, Christian authorities instituted seven ecclesiastical regions, which ran parallel to the civil regions. With the collapse of Imperial authority in the Western Roman Empire, after the death of Julius Nepos in 480, much of the old imperial administrative structures began to fall into abeyance. After the destructive Gothic Wars of the 6th century, the city of Rome had become virtually depopulated. When the city began to recover it was inhabited in new parts and whole districts were in ruins. Consequently, the Augustan regions now had no relationship to the administration of the city, but they continued to be used as a means for identifying property. But as Rome slowly recovered from the disasters of the Gothic wars it became necessary to organize the city for the purpose of defence, and one theory contends that this was the origin of the twelve medieval regions.Poole, pg. 173 In particular, it is suggested that it was connected with the Byzantine military system (the scholae militiae) and was introduced into Rome in the 7th century, along with its implementation at Ravenna. This saw the creation of a new series of regions based upon a different principle from either of the older ones. However, this revision did not last much longer than two centuries after the fall of the Exarchate of Ravenna in 751. Certainly, the division of the city according to the revised civil and ecclesiastical regions appears to have fallen out of use in the confusion of the 10th century. Local variations seem to have sprung up that were adopted, used and then discarded as the years progressed. It has been conjecturedPoole, pgs. 174-175 that the sack of Rome by Robert Guiscard in 1084 caused a displacement of the population which probably made a revision of the regions necessary. The district from the Lateran Palace to the Colosseum was engulfed and ruined by fire, and the Caelian and Aventine hills were gradually abandoned. The number of regions needed for the south and south-east of the city became smaller, while there emerged a greater need for the organization of the rapidly growing districts to the north-west and along the Tiber. The Geographic Boundaries of the 12 Regions during the Tenth Century During the Tenth Century, it appears that there were only 12 regions in use, and their names, locations and boundary divisions bear very little relationship to the subsequent revisions of the regions. Their locations within the city of Rome are as followsGregorovius, Ferdinand, History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages, Volume 3 (1895), pgs 530-534: ‚Ä¢ The first region was called the Horrea, named after the granaries located within it. At that time it included the all the Aventine Hill and it stretched across the Marmorata and the Ripa Graeca, butting up against the banks of the Tiber River. ‚Ä¢ The second region included the Caelian Hill, a section of the Palatine Hill, and stretched southward to the foot of the Aventine Hill. It incorporated the areas around Santi Quattro Coronati, the Aqua Claudia (between the Caelian and Palatine hills), the Circus Maximus, the Septizodium and the Porta Metronia.Gregorovius, III, pg. 530 Both of these regions were merged during the twelfth century to form Ripe et Marmorate. ‚Ä¢ The third region largely corresponded to the old 5th Augustan Region (Esquiliae). It contained Porta Maggiore, Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, the modern Via Merulana, the Arch of Pietas and the Porta Tiburtina. ‚Ä¢ The fourth region contained the church of Sant‚ÄôAgata and most likely the Quirinal and Viminal hills. It also contained the Suburra and the Baths of Diocletian. ‚Ä¢ The fifth region contained the part of the Campus Martius which housed the Mausoleum of Augustus, the Column of Marcus Aurelius, the Via Lata and the church of San Silvestro in Capite. It probably also contained the Porta Pinciana and the modern Porta del Popolo. ‚Ä¢ The sixth region, called Biveretica, presumably named after the monastery of Saint Andrew known as Sant'Andrea de Biveretica, which was situated between the Santi Apostoli and the Column of Trajan, meaning it included at least part of the old Augustan seventh region, the Via Lata. This region included the church of Santa Maria in Trivio, so it was probably centered near the main output for the Aqua Virgo aqueduct, which is supported by the name of the region, a corruption of the Latin Bibere (to drink). This region was absorbed into the subsequent region of Trivii et Vie Late. ‚Ä¢ The seventh region contained the area around the Column and Forum of Trajan, and a part of the Suburra. ‚Ä¢ The eighth region was called Sub Capitolio, and it contained the area of the Roman Forum and the Colosseum, so this region corresponded to the old 8th Augustan region of Rome. ‚Ä¢ The ninth region was given the label ad Scorticlarios, named after the tanners quarter which was situated next to the Baths of Nero. Apart from the Baths, this region also contained the church of Sant'Eustachio, Piazza Navona, the Pantheon and San Lorenzo in Lucina. It also included most of the Campus Martius. It broadly corresponded to the later medieval region of Campi Martis et S. Laurentii in Lucina. ‚Ä¢ The tenth region was referred to as Regione Marcello (Region of Marcellus), meaning that this region was centered around the Theatre of Marcellus which had been part of the ninth region of Imperial Rome (the Circus Flaminius). ‚Ä¢ The eleventh region is not identified. Given the geographic spread of the other regions, it is most likely identical to the largely depopulated 1143 region of Arenule et Caccabariorum. ‚Ä¢ The twelfth region was known as the Piscina Publica and was identical to the old Augustan region. It contained the Baths of Caracalla. List of the 14 regiones of 1143 Drawing of Rome during the 14th century. The next major reform was after the revolution of 1143 and the establishment of the Commune of Rome, as the city was redivided into 14 regions. There was a minor adjustment made in the 13th century, bringing the total number down to thirteen, and it wasn‚Äôt until 1586 that another region was created, once again bringing the total number up to fourteen, and Rome kept these administrative divisions intact until the 19th century. Unlike the Augustan regions of Rome, the medieval regions were not numbered, and few had any relationship to the ancient Roman divisions. They are numbered here merely for convenience. I Montium et Biberatice By the 12th century, the older 10th century region of Biveretica had its name changed to Montium et Biberatice, before simply becoming Montium at the close of the 14th century. This change of name reflected the fact that the Esquiline and the Viminal Hills, and parts of the Quirinal and the Caelian Hills belonged to this rione during the Middle Ages. Like many of the regions during the Middle Ages, the parts on top of the hills were abandoned, as the population sought to remain close to the Tiber River, and so only the part of the region that contained the easternmost part of the Campus Martius was inhabited. By 1143 this region also contained the Forum Romanum and the Colosseum, which was not a part of the older Montium et Biberatice. The Colosseum had at some point during the Middle Ages been fortified and for a time belonged to the area controlled by the Frangipani family. In the beginning of the 16th century this region included part of the district in the neighbourhood of Forum of Trajan, and by the 19th century, the region then referred to as Monti had a boundary which passed between Trajan's Forum and the Santi Apostoli. II Trivii et Vie Late  A region that is believed took its name from absorbing part of the Via Lata, the old Seventh Region of Augustan Rome, while the Trivii described the three principal streets that led to the \\"piazza dei Crociferi\\", a square next to the modern Trevi square. The importance of this location in Medieval Rome is that it was the main output for the Aqua Virgo aqueduct, one of the few aqueducts which underwent frequent restoration works during the centuries. By its remaining active it enabled the region to survive well throughout the Middle Ages, although the change of its sources caused the water's properties (purity, taste, etc.) to become much worse than the original one, which was only restored during alteration works in 1562. During the Middle Ages, the higher reaches of the region (which included part of the Quirinal Hill) were abandoned, as the people chose to inhabit the parts of the region closer to the Tiber River, and during the 9th century, this region was the aristocratic quarter of Rome.Mann, Horace K., The Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages, Vol. II: The Popes During the Carolingian Empire, Part 2: 795-858 (1906), pg. 184 Its name was transformed in modern times to become the region of Trevi. III Columpne et S. Marie in Aquiro This region included parts of the city situated around its most prominent features, the Column of Marcus Aurelius, or Antonine Column (late 2nd century), now standing in Piazza Colonna and the Church of Santa Maria in Aquiro. It also contains the remains of the Temple of Hadrian, with its eleven columns also contributing to the name of the region. A prominent feature during the Middle Ages was the Mons Acceptorius, a small artificial embankment created by the pre-Roman inhabitants in order to drive stilts into the swampy ground, and build dry huts for housing. Prior to the 16th century, the region was never densely populated. It now forms part of the modern rione of Colonna. IV Campi Martis et S. Laurentii in Lucina Included the parts of Rome around the Campo Marzio and San Lorenzo in Lucina. V Pontis et Scorteclariorum Included the parts of Rome around Ponte. Unlike its modern counterpart, it included the area across the Tiber spanned by the Ponte Sant'Angelo. This bridge was built by Emperor Hadrian (and originally named after him Pons Aelius) in 134 to connect his mausoleum to the rest of the city. In ancient Rome, the area belonged to the IX Augustan region called Circus Flaminius, that was a part of the Campus Martius. Nero built another bridge, that was called Neronianus or triumphalis because the Via Triumphalis, the Triumphal Way, passed over it: Starting with Titus, the victorious Emperors celebrating their Triumphs entered Rome marching through it. Nero's bridge was also called Pons Vaticanus (meaning \\"Vatican Bridge\\" in Latin), because it connected the Ager Vaticanus to the left bank, later Pons ruptus (\\"broken bridge\\"), because it was already broken in the Middle Ages. Pope Sixtus V eventually changed the rione limits so that the Ponte Sant'Angelo belonged to Borgo. VI S. Eustachii et Vinea Teudemarii Included the parts of Rome around the church of Sant'Eustachio and forms part of the modern rione of Sant'Eustachio. VII Arenule et Caccabariorum The name of the region stemmed from Arenula, (the name is present in the modern Via Arenula) that was the name given to the soft sand (rena in Italian) that the river Tiber left after the floods, and that built strands on the left bank. It included parts of the city around Regola. In Augustan Rome, the medieval region straddled both the Campus Martius and the IX region called Circus Flaminius. Here there was the Trigarium, the stadium where the riders of the triga (a cart with three horses) used to train. During the early Middle Ages, it belonged to the 4th of the seven ecclesiastic regions. The region was not widely inhabited due to the frequent flooding of the river Tiber, causing the whole area to be extremely unhealthy, especially during summer. It was only drained at the end of the Middle Ages, after which it was reclaimed by the city and reinhabited once again. VIII Parionis et S. Laurentii in Damaso During Antiquity, it belonged to the 9th Augustan region called Circo Flaminio. In this area Pompey built his curia, while Domitian built his stadium and an Odeon (Odeum in Latin), for musical and poetic competitions. During the early Middle Ages it included parts of the city around San Lorenzo in Damaso. From 1200 the population kept on increasing until the 15th century, when it increased in importance due to the paving of Campo de' Fiori, so that it soon became an important economic center. Under Sixtus IV (1471‚Äì1484) the rione lost much of its chaotic look, typical of the Middle Ages, for a cleaner and tidier one, in keeping with the changes brought about by the Renaissance. It saw the recovery of buildings, the enlargement of streets, and the rebuilding of the ancient Pons Aurelius into a new bridge, the \\"Ponte Sisto\\" connecting Trastevere and Parione. This activity improved the quality of the region. Thanks to this renewal, urbanization increased between the 1400 and 1500. In the same period, several artists were asked to renew the front of the most important of the buildings in the region. In 1500, most of the commercial activity slowly moved from Campo de' Fiori to Piazza Navona, due to the fact that it had more space for trading. Today it is part of the modern rione of Parione. IX Pinee et S. Marci At the beginning of the 10th century, this region was referred to as Pina before transforming into Pinee et S. Marci by the 12th century, and finally into Pigna by the 16th century. For many centuries this region has been reckoned as the ninth region, certainly parts of it, such as the Pantheon were included in the ninth region of Augustan Rome. From at least the 16th century, and possibly much earlier, this region has been centered on the Basilica of San Marco, Santa Maria sopra Minerva and the Pantheon. X S. Angeli in Foro Piscium The Theatre of Marcellus, after which a region of Rome was named in the 10th century. Referred to as Regione Marcello in the tenth century, by the 12th century, its name had changed to indicate that it included parts of the city around the fish market, which had moved from the Forum Piscarium, located near the Forum Romanum, into the ruins of the Porticus Octaviae, though it still included the Theatre of Marcellus, which now housed the shops of smiths and coppersmiths inside the arcades of the theater. It also included the most important church of the rione, Sant'Angelo in Foro Piscium (\\"St. Angel in the Fish Market\\"). This church, erected in 770 inside the Propylea of the Portico of Octavia, had a great historical importance during the Middle Ages. From here, on the Whitsunday of 1347, the Romans, led by Cola di Rienzo, launched the assault on the Capitol, attempting to restore the Roman Republic. This region now forms part of the region of Sant'Angelo. XI Ripe et Marmorate Includes part of the city that bounded on the east bank of the old Port of Rome, the Ripa Grande (\\"Great Bank\\"), it was constructed after the Second Punic War, and was only abandoned in the 19th century. The area of the Marmorate referred to the river bank south of the Aventine Hill where, since the imperial age, rough blocks of different kinds of marble (marmora), shipped to Rome from the East, were stored in a large deposit area, called the emporium. During the period of the high empire, a number of rich mansions stood here but they were mostly destroyed during the barbarian invasions of the 5th century, resulting in the area being almost completely abandoned, with the exception of a few convents on the heights of the Aventine Hill, located on a safer spot. The district became again inhabited during the Renaissance, when sometime during the 16th century the river port called Ripa Grande was made operational once again. During the 13th century, the section where the Arch of Janus is located was included by the Frangipani family in their fortified estate, which stretched over the Palatine Hill and included the remains of the small Frangipani Tower at the southern end of the Circus Maximus, which was also within this region. The area also had the headquarters of the Knights Templar in Rome from the 11th to the 13th centuries. The region incorporated parts of today‚Äôs Via Marmorata, and forms part of the modern rione of Ripa. XII Campitelli et S. Adriani During the 10th century, this region was referred to as the Clivus Argentarii, and it contained the streets that now connect the Corso with the Forum Romanum (the old Via di Marforio). It includes parts of the city around the Piazza di Campitelli, near Santa Maria in Campitelli, and forms part of the modern rione of Campitelli. It also included the church of Sant'Adriano al Foro. XIII Trastevere Originally a separate region in 1143 from the Tiber Island, these two regions were combined in the 13th century, bringing the total number of regions down to thirteen. XIV Insula Tiberina The Tiber Island. After its amalgamation with the region of Trastevere, Rome did not get a fourteenth region until 1586 when Sixtus V added the old Leonine City, considered until then outside the city, as a new administrative division, under the name of Borgo.

The border was soon readjusted following diplomatic agreements. Elections to the People's Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belorussia, which took place on October 22, 1939, were an attempt to legitimize the annexation of the Second Polish Republic by the Soviet Union following the September 17 Soviet invasion of Poland in accordance with the secret protocol of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. Only one month after the eastern territories of Poland were occupied by the Red Army, the Soviet secret police and military led by the Party officials staged the local elections in an atmosphere of state terror. The referendum was rigged. The ballot envelopes were numbered and often handed over already sealed. By design, the candidates were unknown to their constituencies which were brought to the voting stations by armed militias. The results were to become the official legitimization of the Soviet takeover of what is known today as the Western Belorussia and the Western Ukraine. Consequently, both Assemblies voted for incorporation of all formerly Polish voivodeships into the Soviet Union. Background On September 17, 1939, the Red Army invaded eastern Poland, facing weak resistance of units of the Border Defence Corps, scattered along the border. The Soviets moved quickly westwards, towards the line of partition of Poland, established earlier, during Soviet‚ÄìNazi negotiations. After the invasion, the Second Polish Republic and Soviet Union found themselves de facto at war with each other, and Soviet authorities took advantage of the situation, to make permanent changes of the legal order of occupied territories. Their activities broke Article 43 of the 1907 Hague Convention, which states: \\"The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country\\".Laws of War : Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague IV); October 18, 1907. As soon as the Soviets occupied Polish areas, they began organizing local governments and units of administrative division, whose borders roughly corresponded with the borders of interbellum voivodeships. Temporary authorities were made of NKVD agents, Red Army officers, local laborers, and left-wing intelligentsia. Their task was to organize the so- called workers guard in the municipal centers, and farmers committees, which were preparing land reform. Soon afterwards, these temporary authorities were replaced with Soviet-style administration and Communist Party of the Soviet Union committees. Also, NKVD apparatus took over military tasks. After signing the German‚ÄìSoviet Frontier Treaty (28 September 1939), which established the mutual border along the Bug River, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided on October 1, 1939, that People's Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belorussia should be called in Lviv (for Western Ukraine), and Belastok (for Western Belorussia). The task of these bodies was to urge Moscow to incorporate the land into the Soviet Union. Furthermore, a People's Assembly of Poland had been planned, for the areas around Lublin, Siedlce, and ≈Åom≈ºa, which were to have been annexed by the Soviets. However, after some changes in the Nazi‚ÄìSoviet Pact (see German‚ÄìSoviet Frontier Treaty), those areas were occupied by Nazi Germany. The election Soviet propaganda poster; the killing of the Polish Eagle in the east The electoral campaign began on October 7, 1939, and from the beginning, was supervised by the NKVD troops. The campaign itself took place in an atmosphere of state terror, with mass arrests, and uniformed NKVD agents present at all polling stations. All candidates had been designated by the party's local peasants and workers' committees based on instructions from Moscow. It was not possible to vote for anybody else. Soviet banners and posters were seen everywhere, people were gathered to listen to propaganda slogans, and frequently, citizens were told that if they did not participate, they would be fired, arrested, and even sent to Siberia. Electoral meetings were very short. Participants were asked \\"who was against\\" the candidate offered; frightened people would not raise their hands, and then the meeting was closed. On October 11, in article published in Pravda, Soviet propaganda pointed out the issues to be solved by the Western Ukraine's Assembly. These were: establishment of Soviet authority, unification of Western Ukraine with Soviet Ukraine, confiscation of estates, and nationalization of banks and industrial properties. There were instances when local Polish Communists, especially in Western Belorussia, tried to designate their own candidates, but these attempts were immediately dismissed by the party officials. Historian Rafal Wnuk, author of the book During the First Soviet, described the election in the city of Lviv. According to his research, on the day of the election, the city was flooded with the Soviet propaganda posters. At the polling stations, the inhabitants were able to purchase alcohol products and foods otherwise not available on the market. In some cases, people were brought by force. As Bronislawa Stachowicz from Lviv recalled: At all voting stations, there were uniformed militia or soldiers, and names were checked on a list. Voting was monitored to such a degree that in some places people were given envelopes which had been already sealed, and told to drop them in the box. Both the campaign and the election were presented as a \\"great holiday of the freed people\\". A Polish-language newspaper \\"Wolna ≈Åom≈ºa\\" (\\"Free ≈Åom≈ºa\\") wrote on October 22 that \\"suppressed by the Polish masters masses of Western Belorussia had been waiting for this day [October 22] for almost twenty years\\". Another newspaper, \\"Nowe Zycie\\" (\\"New Life\\") wrote: \\"Never before has the nation enjoyed so much freedom as now, given by the Red Army\\". The results of the election show the efficiency of the Stalinist state. According to the official data, in Western Ukraine, 93% voters took part in it, and in Western Belorussia, 96%. Party candidates garnered more than 90% of the popular vote. However, in some districts (11 in Ukraine, and 2 in Belorussia), the candidates were so unpopular, that they got less than half of the votes, and it was necessary to organize a second election. Among those eligible to vote, were soldiers of the Red Army, who had invaded these provinces just five weeks before. Polish historians noted some cases of civil disobedience, which took place despite widespread terror. In Bia≈Çystok, people would put in cards with slogans such as \\"Long live Poland, Bia≈Çystok is not Belorussia\\". In Hrodna, slogans on the walls were painted, which said \\"Down with the Bolsheviks, long live Poland\\", and in Pinsk, high school students handed leaflets stating: \\"Long live Poland, down with Communists\\".

The Lviv meeting was opened by Ukrainian philology professor Kyryl Studynsky, and the Bia≈Çystok meeting - by Belorussian peasant Stepan Strug. Out of 926 members of the People's Assembly of Western Belorussia, there were 621 Belorussians, 127 Poles, 72 Jews, 43 Russians, 53 Ukrainians, and 10 from other nationalities. The Western Ukraine's People's Assembly had 1,482 members, out of which Poles made only 3%.Tomasz Bereza, Pa≈∫dziernik 1939 r. - poczƒÖtki sowietyzacji Kres√≥w Wschodnich Rzeczypospolitej. Rzesz√≥w's office of Institute of National Remembrance. Both bodies supported the establishment of Soviet rule over the occupied territories, and issued official requests to the Supreme Soviet, asking it for permission to join the already existing Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Also, all real estate of landowners, churches and state officials, was confiscated without compensation (including buildings and animals). Banks and larger factories were nationalized, and September 17 was established as an official holiday. Meetings of both Assemblies were based on criticism of interbellum Poland, describing \\"exterminational policies of White Polish occupiers, bloodsuckers and landowners\\", who suppressed \\"Ukrainian and Belorussian masses\\". People's Assembly of Western Ukraine wrote an official letter, which was sent to the Belorussia Assembly. Among others, it said: \\"We were brothers in captivity and struggle against Polish masters. Now we have become brothers in freedom and happines. Great Red Army, fulfilling the wishes of the mighty Soviet nations, has come here and for centuries freed us, Western Ukrainians and Western Belorussians, from suppression of Polish landowners and capitalists\\". On November 1, the Supreme Soviet approved annexation of Western Ukraine, and on the next day, of Western Belorussia. On November 14, the Supreme Soviet of Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in Minsk officially annexed former territories of northeastern Poland, without the area of Wilno, which had been seized by Lithuania. On November 15, the Supreme Soviet of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in Kiev, annexed former southeastern Poland. On November 29, the Supreme Soviet issued a decree upon which all inhabitants of Poland living in Western Ukraine and Western Belorussia became citizens of the Soviet Union. This decision had a far-reaching consequences, because now, the NKVD apparatus had legal reasons to arrest members of prewar political parties of Poland, accusing them of anti-Soviet activity. Furthermore, the Supreme Soviet's decree resulted in massive draft into the Red Army. Polish historian Rafal Wnuk estimates that 210 000 inhabitants of former eastern Poland, born in 1917, 1918, and 1919, ended up in the Red Army. After official annexation of Western Ukraine and Western Belorussia, both Assemblies were dissolved.

Collura, Ph.D., PE (born 1952) is President of BrainMaster Technologies Incorporated, and Clinical Director of the Brain Enrichment Center, both located in Bedford, Ohio and is a past president of the International Society for Neurofeedback & Research (ISNR). He also has served the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB) as the President of the Neurofeedback Division. He is a pioneer of creating low-cost EEG acquisition machines for neurofeedback and research purposes and for developing real-time normative database neurofeedback training utilizing z-scores as a quantitative method of regulating metrics related to power and connectivity in the EEG. His work in z-score based neurofeedback has revolutionized the industry by providing practitioners with a method whereby they may see instantaneous responses of the efficacy of their neurofeedback training protocol and automatically assess which values are outside of their respective normative value. In doing so, the z-score software spearheaded by Dr. Collura can immediately recognize the deviant value, and focus training on that particular metric. At BrainMaster Technologies, he is the Chief Executive and the President of Research and Development. He actively participates in and personally guides the development of all the various hardware and software components produced by BrainMaster Technologies. Early life and college Dr. Thomas Collura, Ph.D., QEEG-D, BCN, LPCC was born in Cleveland, Ohio on January 5, 1952.

Like regular polo, it is played in chukkas (periods) with two teams on horses who use mallets to hit a ball through a goal. It differs from traditional polo in that five riders make up a team instead of four, western saddles and equipment are used, and the playing field is usually a simple rodeo arena or other enclosed dirt area, indoors or out. Also, instead of the small ball used in traditional polo, the players use a large red rubber medicine ball and use mallets with long fiberglass shafts and hard rubber heads.Healy, Donna. \\"Hockey on Horseback\\". Billings Gazette, September 20, 2009. Accessed September 20, 2009 Horses The horse breed most often used for cowboy polo is the American Quarter Horse, due to its agility. Unlike regular polo, where multiple horses are used within a single game, riders do not change horses between chukkas, but instead are only allowed two horses, and in some competitions are required to ride one horse throughout. This ability to compete with relatively few animals has given the sport its nickname, the \\"average man's\\" sport. Horses competing in cowboy polo are often older, experienced animals with steady dispositions who have come to understand the basic purpose of the game and can assist their riders. History Cowboy polo originated in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, in 1952, where it was called Palmetto Polo. The name came from the mallet handles, which were made out of palm. It was renamed \\"cowboy polo\\" in 1959.Wallace, Glenda. \\"Cowboy Polo: Family Fun on Horseback.\\" Distinctly Montana, Fall 2006. Accessed September 20, 2009 As it came west, it was connected almost entirely to the membership of sheriff's posses, groups primarily dedicated to mounted search and rescue, consisting of deputized law enforcement volunteers. While participation was once limited to men only, women were admitted to the sport in the mid-1990s. It reached its peak of popularity during the 1970s, with clubs from Texas to Montana, as well as clubs in Australia. However, since then, cowboy polo has been in decline, with the national organization disbanding in 2005. Today, the sport is almost exclusively played in Montana. Even in Montana, where there were once 30 clubs, there are now only five. Rules Though the sport has written rules, the most commonly enforced rule is unwritten: any rider who falls off his or her horse must buy beer for the entire team. Teams consist of five players, with two horseback referees and two goal spotters. Riders are limited to two horses per game, though most players use one horse throughout. The game is played in four periods of 15 minutes each, called, as in regular polo, \\"chukkas.\\" There are mandatory four-minute rest periods at the end of each chukka and a nine-minute break at half time. Each team is allowed four two- minute time outs during the game.Laurel Saddle Club Cowboy Polo Team. Rules, Equipment and Dress. Accessed September 20, 2009 Teams switch ends at each chukka. The field is divided widthwise into four sections or zones, and one center zone of . Each team has one player assigned to each zone with the goal of hitting the ball toward the opponents' goal. If a player crosses into another zone, the team loses control of the ball to the other team. The goal areas are each and located at each end of the arena. The arena is generally wide. A goal made from the first zone is worth one point. Goals made from the second zone from the goal, without being touched by either player in the first zone is worth two points. An untouched goal from the center zone counts for three points. Balls knocked out of the field are returned to the spot where the ball exited the field and the opposing team takes control of the ball. Unruly or disobedient horses may be asked to leave the field, as will players who endanger other players unnecessarily. Equipment failure during the game that presents a danger to a player or horse results in a safety time out called by the referee. Safety is of paramount importance. There are 32 rules of play, including 11 types of personal fouls, including ‚Äúreaching across an opposing player‚Äôs horse,‚Äù or ‚Äúriding into and hitting an opposing player‚Äôs horse in front or back of the saddle with his/her horse‚Äôs front quarters, at greater than a 45-degree angle.‚Äù Equipment The ball for cowboy polo is a red rubber medicine ball. The polo mallet has a maximum length of . It was traditionally made of cane but can be made of fiberglass. Saddles must be American western saddles or Australian stock saddles. Participants are strongly encouraged to have their horses wear polo bandages or splint boots. Use of a breast collar is optional. There are no specific rules for horse headgear, as long as the equipment is humane. Tie-downs are allowed, but officials may require the removal of any piece of equipment liable to cause discomfort to the horse. For riders, hats or headgear is required. Most riders now wear some form of equestrian helmet or other protective headgear, such as a cricket helmet with a face guard. However, Western or Australian style felt hats may be worn. Extra protective clothing such as knee and shin guards, is optional, though they must not be hard or sharp edged to prevent injury to your opponent or his/her horse. Riders also must wear jeans, riding boots and a shirt in the specified club color.

New to the paintball pistol market, Tippmann released the TPX in 2009. This paintball marker uses an air system that allows for 12 gram CO2 cartridges to be placed underneath the barrel. This was meant to eliminate bulk in the grip of the marker caused by placing the CO2 cartridge in the magazines.Tippmann TPX Tippmann. Retrieved September 21, 2009. In 2011,Tippmann changed the name of the pistol to the TiPX to market all the improved parts at that time, as well as differentiate it from the TPX baseball line by Louisville Slugger. Retrieved January 23, 2014. Features The TPX pistol is designed to include many features not included on many .68 caliber paintball pistols. It competes with Tiberius Arms in the .68 caliber magazine fed pistol market,.TPX vs. Tac 8 Specialops. Retrieved September 21, 2009. Under Barrel Air Cartridge The Tippmann TPX features an area underneath its barrel for the operator to place 12 gram CO2 cartridges that provide velocity for paintballs to be shot out of the pistol. In this chamber the CO2 cartridge is held in place by a quarter turn cap that twists clockwise into place. Tippmann claims that the TPX punctures this cartridge when the user pulls the trigger of the marker for the first time, although there have been troubles reported with this feature.TPX Upgrade Tippmann The purpose of this design is to remove the cartridge from the paintball magazines. Removing the air cartridge from the magazine is meant to eliminate bulk from the pistol grip allowing it to be easier to hold. Magazines Tippmann's TPX pistol is their first .68 caliber paintball pistol that is designed to feed paintballs using magazines. Magazines made for the TPX pistol were designed to hold eight paintballs originally, but are now sent with a newly designed seven paintball configuration to prevent breaks. These are loaded with a spring that when released forces paintballs into the chamber of the pistol, allowing the TPX to be fed from the bottom up, as opposed to traditional paintball markers that are fed from the top down with the assistance of gravity. This spring must be compressed before loading paintballs into the magazine, and when loaded into the marker will be released automatically to start feeding paintballs into the TPX chamber. Upon a press of the magazine release button, the TPX ejects the loaded magazine with a push from a spring. Metal Trigger In order to add stability to the initial puncture of the CO2 cartridge Tippmann designed the trigger of the TPX pistol out of cast zinc (with a nickel-plated finish). After insertion of a 12 gram CO2 cartridge one pull of this trigger will puncture it allowing for the CO2 to enter the gun to be used to propel the paintballs. Covered Ammo Windows Ammunition windows allow for the user of the TPX to view paintballs as they are inside the grip of the pistol. The TPX includes this feature. Holes are made in the sides of the pistol grip, and in the top of the marker above the magazine to create ammunition windows. These are covered with clear plastic to protect the paint inside the marker from external elements. Picatinny Rail Directly underneath the 12 gram CO2 cartridge chamber on the TPX there is a picatinny rail. Rails similar to this are found on numerous paintball markers, and are designed in order to attach accessories such as tactical lights or laser pointers. Lanyard Clip At the back bottom corner of the grip of the Tippmann TPX pistol is featured a circular cut-out designed to string a lanyard through. Attaching a lanyard allows the user of the paintball pistol to string the marker to their wrist in order to keep from losing it. Operation The Tippmann TPX operates on an open bolt blow-forward action system. Propellant To insert a 12 gram CO2 cartridge into the marker turn the quarter turn cap counter- clockwise, then pull out, and then counter-clockwise again. Insert the cartridge narrow side first, then return the cap to its original position with two turns clockwise. The cartridge will not puncture until the trigger is pulled. This first pull however, will not fire the marker. To use a remote air source a remote line adapter must be installed. This feature requires that an empty 12 gram CO2 cartridge be in place before a remote hose can be used with the TPX paintball pistol. Attachment of the remote air source depends on the remote line being used and is compatible with standard lines. Loading To load the TPX, first push the magazine follower tab down until it clicks into place with the spring compressed. Next while keeping the magazine vertical, insert paintballs one at a time until there are eight or with the Tru-Feed magazine(7) in the magazine. The paintballs should align in an alternating pattern with the very bottom ball being closest to the front. When this magazine is loaded into the grip of the marker the spring will automatically decompress forcing a paintball into the chamber. Preparing to Fire Unlike the traditional paintball marker, the TPX uses a blow forward action. To prepare this action for fire the operator must simply pull the trigger back once. This initial pull will not fire the marker, but trigger pulls performed after it will until all air is removed from the marker. Upgrades and Modifications In order to enhance the performance of the TPX pistol Tippmann as well as other companies have designed aftermarket upgrades and modifications for the marker. Remote Line Adapter photo showing the position of the remote line adapter on the Tippmann TPX paintball marker While the marker is designed to use 12 gram CO2 cartridges as its propellant, a remote line adapter can be installed in order to hook the TPX up to an external air source. Use of a remote line with the TPX increases the amount of air supply the marker has at one time by allowing larger sources of air to be used with the marker. Installation of this modification requires internal parts to be replaced in order to allow the air flow from the 12 gram CO2 cartridge to change and be redirected. This modification also requires a small piece in the back of the marker to be taken out.TPX Manual Tippmann. (PDF) Retrieved September 21, 2009. In order for this upgrade to function properly a used or empty 12 gram CO2 cartridge must be in place in the chamber underneath the barrel. Most remote lines are compatible with the TPX remote line adapter modification, and connection of the line depends on the model of remote hose being used. Extra Magazines Tippmann includes in their basic TPX pistol package two magazines. Extra magazines made by Tippmann can be bought in pairs, and provide for more paintballs to be carried without having to reload the magazines on the field. Each magazine is exactly the same as the two provided with the stock marker, and are loaded and used the same. After-market barrels Traditionally, after-market barrels are designed for most paintball markers. Tippmann's TPX is no exception, as there have been numerous barrels made to modify the performance and accuracy of the marker. After-market barrels are often used to enhance accuracy. Hammerhead has designed a rifled barrel that is compatible with the TPX. BT's APEX barrel can also be used with the TPX paintball pistol, and is designed to enhance distance and accuracy, and propel paintballs around obstacles. Other after- market barrels made for the TPX are designed to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the marker such as RAP4's silencer barrel. All TPX barrels are also compatible with the Tippmann A-5 and Tippmann X7 markers as the threading of these barrels are all the same. Recalls *As of 2009 no recalls have been announced for the TPX pistol.Tippmann Recalls Tippmann. Retrieved September 21, 2009. *A noteworthy free upgrade for the TPX CO2 puncturing system can be found on Tippmann's web page. This upgrade is sent to TPX owners having trouble puncturing CO2 cartridges with the first pull of the trigger. This kit includes an adjustable set screw to allow for different lengths of 12 gram CO2 cartridges to be used with the marker, as well as a new puncture pin. Criticisms Within the first year of its production, the Tippmann has received numerous complaints about the CO2 puncturing system not working correctly. Many TPX operators have had issues making the first pull of the TPX trigger puncture the inserted 12 gram CO2 cartridge.

In Canada, the distribution of the Nooksack dace is limited to four streams: three in the Nooksack basin, and one in the Fraser basin. In Canada, degradation of the stream channels due to urbanization, agriculture and low instream flow has led to the species being declared endangered under Canada's Species at Risk Act.

In honor of in the struggle against the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, his name was inscribed on the Wall of Remembrance at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani in 1998 - the year in which he died. An national cultural award named in his honor, the Gawad Soc Rodrigo is given by the Philippines' Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino (KWF) and National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA).  Personal life  Soc Rodrigo was born on 29 January 1914 in Bulacan, Bulacan, to food vendor Marcela Aldana and horse-carriage driver Melecio Rodrigo. He was a relative to the Filipino heroes Marcelo del Pilar and Gregorio del Pilar. In 1937, Rodrigo married his childhood sweetheart Remedios Enriquez. Prior to this, he took Law at the University of the Philippines, which he finished in 1938.http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk270/kofranks/BluebloodSoc1.jpg  Education  Rodrigo received his elementary education from the Bulacan Elementary School, and moved on to secondary school at the University of the Philippines High School. He earned his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Education degrees from Ateneo de Manila and University of Santo Tomas, graduating magna cum laude and valedictorian. He was captain of the debate team at university.  Career   Literary works  Rodrigo was a playwright in English and Tagalog, with works described as those that distilled within the Filipino soul. His most celebrated play was Sa Pula, Sa Puti while his most popular Kuro ‚Äì Kuro sa likod ng mga Balita had also won legions of admirers throughout the country. Some other famous works include Tagalog translations of works of Martyr of Golgotha and Cyrano de Bergerac. Rodrigo was also known for his tanaga.  World War II  During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Rodrigo distributed anti-Japanese propaganda materials together with Raul Manglapus and Manuel Fruto. In his book \\"Mga Bakas ng Kahapon\\", Rodrigo reflected on the fate he and his family of four may have suffered had he been implicated by Manglapus and Fruto during their capture. In 1945, he moved his family to the underground basement of the Philippine General Hospital in Manila, where they survived the building‚Äôs destruction.  Postwar Law and broadcasting career  After the war, Rodrigo resumed his law practice by joining the law firm of Francisco Delgado and Lorenzo Ta√±ada. Then, he opened the Rodrigo Law Office in 1946. Rodrigo authored Philippine Modern Legal Forms and Handbook on the Rules of Court. In 1951, Rodrigo became the president of the Ateneo Parent- Teacher Association, then became the president of the Ateneo Alumni Association in 1953. In 1953, Rodrigo and Bob Stewart ran an unprecedented 48-hour coverage of the entire proceedings of the 1953 Presidential Elections. Rodrigo was awarded by president Ramon Magsaysay a Legion of Honor due to this marathon broadcast.  Philippine Senate service  In 1955, Rodrigo won a seat in the Philippine Senate under the Nacionalista Party of President Magsaysay. One of Rodrigo‚Äôs speeches, \\"Catholics in Politics,\\" delivered on 7 September 1957, is included in the Anvil Press book \\"20 Speeches That Moved a Nation.\\" Awarded as one of the Ten Outstanding Senators of his time, he was a much invited guest of foreign governments such as the United States, Britain and West Germany, among others. Rodrigo was also awarded a U.S. Government grant under the terms of Public Law 402 (Smith - Mundt) for observation and travel under the auspices of the Governmental Affairs Institute (Nov. 20, 1959 - Jan. 20, 1960). For the 1959 midterm elections, Rodrigo ran an unsuccessful campaign for the ‚ÄúGrand Alliance‚Äù counting as candidates Emmanuel Pelaez, Raul Manglapus and Jorge Vargas, among others. Then in 1961, Rodrigo got the third- most votes to win a second senatorial term as a Liberal Party candidate with Diosdado Macapagal.http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view_article.php?article_id=42719 He sought a third term in 1967 but lost. From 1970-1972, Rodrigo hosted the ABS-CBN program \\"Mga Kuro-kuro ni Soc Rodrigo.\\"  Martial Law activism  For his dissent against President Ferdinand Marcos, Rodrigo, along with Ninoy Aquino and many others, was incarcerated during upon the declaration of Martial Law in 1972. During this time in jail, Rodrigo kept the faith of fellow detainees alive as he led nightly prayers of the rosary. Aquino would treasure of the crucifixes that Rodrigo gave him during this time. Rodrigo was released after three months but was detained two more times. In 1978, for writing Tagalog poems attacking the Marcos dictatorship, and in 1982, for his anti-Marcos poems in the We Forum and Philippine Star. In 1983, Rodrigo was one of the first people allowed to look at the newly assassinated Ninoy Aquino‚Äôs body. Rodrigo felt distraught over this incident since he was one of those who advised Aquino to return to the Philippines from exile in the United States.http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk270/kofranks/BluebloodSoc2.jpg  End of the Marcos dictatorship and service in the 1986 Constitutional Commission After the People Power revolution that sent Marcos to exile, Rodrigo was chosen by President Cory Aquino to be a Commissioner of the 1986 Constitutional Commission. Many of Rodrigo‚Äôs children were against his being a member, preferring instead to see him in the Senate one more time. Instead, he joined the commission as he turned his back on politics forever. The new Constitution was ratified by the people in February 1987.http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk270/kofranks/BluebloodSoc3.jpg Retirement and Death Francisco Soc Rodrigo marker, National Historical Commission of the Philippines. After his service in the Constitutional Commission, Rodrigo largely retired from public life, preferring to spend time with his family. Until just before his death, though, he wrote columns for the newspapers Malaya (1980‚Äì1989) and Philippine Star (1992‚Äì1997). On 4 January 1998, Rodrigo died at the age of 83 due to complications from cancer.  Legacy  In November 1998 - the same year in which he died, Soc Rodrigo's name was inscribed in the Wall of Remembrance at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani in Quezon City, to honor his role in the struggle against Ferdinand Marcos. The Gawad Soc Rodrigo is an award named after him given by the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino (KWF) and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA).

Early life and service Federico Carlo Martinengo was born in Rome on 18 July 1899.Federico Martinengo on the site of the Italian NavyFranks et al 1997, p. 144. The son of a naval officer, he studied the classics in school before moving on to the Regia Accademia Navale in Leghorn in September 1911. After graduating as a midshipman on 25 May 1915, the day after Italy entered World War I was serving on the Italian battleship Dante Alighieri when Italy entered the war in 1915.Varriale 2009, pp. 47-48. World War I and aviation career During World War I, Martinengo first served on board the battleship Conte di Cavour and later on the transport Trinacria. Having volunteered for aviation soon after the war began, he trained at Taranto, then reported to the main Italian naval base at Venice, in September 1916. On 10 October 1916, he was flying as an observer with Pietro Valdimiro when they clashed with an Austro-Hungarian seaplane. From a position below and ahead of the seaplane, Martinengo managed to knock out its engine with gunfire. This first victory (which granted him a Silver Medal of Military Valor) was soon followed by a second on the 23rd. Then, on 11 November, Martinengo was transferred to Grado. His friendly good cheer was to be put to the test in the command of 1a Squadriglia (soon to be re-dubbed 253a Squadriglia). Summer 1917 was spent by Martinengo familiarizing himself with a new plane, the Macchi M.5 seaplane. When enough of the new planes accumulated, they were formed into the new 260a Squadriglia with Martinengo included. The new squadron was thrown immediately into battle covering the retreat from the Battle of Caporetto. On 5 November 1917, they were disgraced during an escort mission, when the Austro-Hungarian aces Godwin Brumowski, Frank Linke- Crawford, and Rudolf Szepessy-Sokoll shot down the Macchi L.3 being escorted. In December, Martinengo was promoted to command of the squadron. About February 1918, he was promoted to Lieutenant. On 4 May 1918, he led an interception off Trieste of four Austro-Hungarian seaplanes led by Gottfried Freiherr von Banfield. Three of the Austro-Hungarian planes fell before the guns of Martinengo, Calvello, Pierozzi and their squadronmates. Banfield also went down, but escaped by gliding to friendly waters, where he was rescued. In June, Martinengo was transferred off combat duty after 172 sorties; he moved to Bolsena Flying School. There he taught American as well as Italian naval aviators. In September, he was posted to Otranto. The war ended during this assignment. Interwar years Martinengo remained in the surface navy after the war. In 1919 he became executive officer on a torpedo boat; he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in 1927 and to Commander in 1932. Between 1931 and 1933, he commanded the Italian naval detachment at Tianjin, China. Back to Italy, he attended the Naval Warfare Institute and became Captain, after which he was appointed commander of the Leros naval base and later of the light cruiser Muzio Attendolo. World War II Soon after Italy's entry into World War II, on 9 July 1940, Martinengo participated in the Battle of Calabria, in command of Attendolo. After some more missions with the cruiser, including escorting a convoy to Libya and taking part in the contrast of Operation Hats,VITA OPERATIVA DEGLI INCROCIATORI LEGGERI Classe ‚ÄúCONDOTTIERI‚Äù, Gruppo ‚ÄúRAIMONDO MOTECUCCOLI‚Äù in October 1940 Martinengo became Chief of Staff of the Taranto Naval Department, a charge that he held until promoted to Rear Admiral. On 10 April 1943, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the anti- submarine forces of the Italian Navy, with seat in La Spezia. The announcement of the armistice between Italy and the Allies found Martinengo in Rome; acting upon instructions he had received, in the morning of 9 September 1943 he reached La Spezia, ordered every operational submarine chaser to move south to reach an Allied-controlled port, and then left himself La Spezia onboard the submarine chaser VAS 234, in company with her sistership VAS 235.Giuseppe Fioravanzo, La Marina dall‚Äô8 settembre 1943 alla fine del conflitto, USMM (Italian Navy Historical Branch), Rome, 1962, pp. 66 to 68 Around 12:30 on the same day, the two submarine chasers met two German R boats off Gorgona Island; the latter commanded them to stop, but Martinengo ordered to increase speed instead, upon which the German units opened fire with their machine guns, and the Italian submarine chasers returned fire. They fought with their machine guns till 13:20, then Martinengo ordered to go nearer to the coast in nearby Cala Scirocco, so that they would obtain support from the Italian coastal batteries on the island (as the German R-Boats were more heavily armed than his two VAS). Having personally taken the helm of VAS 234, Martinengo was hit ten minutes later by a burst of machine gun from one of the R-Boats, and he was killed instantly. VAS 234 was also set afire, but she managed to reach the shore and allow her crew to disembark, before exploding and sinking. Martinengo's body (he had been the only casualty in the fight) was recovered on 14 September and buried at Gorgona; he was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor. Legacy The Marina Militare Italiana has named one FREMM multipurpose frigate, as of now still under construction, after him. Notes References * Franks, Norman; Guest, Russell; Alegi, Gregory.

Gorreta (plural Gorretes), a variant of gorra, refers to the cap as well. The Revolt of the Barretines (; ) also known as the Revolt of the Gorretes, was a Catalan rebellion fought against the government of King Charles II of Spain. The most salient complaint was against the government's quartering of soldiers. Other issues of contention were tax protests and Catalan nationalistic tensions. The revolt was funded and intensified by agents of France as part of the War of the Grand Alliance. Civil disorder lasted from 1687 to 1689. Support for the revolt was concentrated in rural areas, particularly the poor. The only members of the elite who supported the revolt were wealthy commoners from the countryside. The city of Barcelona, merchants, the intelligentsia, and the local government bodies were largely unsympathetic. Background Discord had existed for some time between the Castilian-dominated Spanish government and inhabitants of the realms of the Crown of Aragon (which included the Kingdom of Aragon itself, the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and the Principality of Catalonia). The crowns of Aragon and Castile had been dynastically unified under the same king since 1517, during the reign of King Charles I, grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella. However, they remained separate polities with their own laws and institutions. Discontent had boiled over into revolts several times, most notably in the Reapers' War () from 1640-1652\\\\. The 1640 revolt had broad support among Catalan society, and the Catalans' ally France annexed Roussillon (also known as French Cedagne or Northern Catalonia) as a result of the war. Since the revolt, however, feelings toward France had grown more ambivalent in Catalonia. France came to be seen more as an economic competitor than a useful ally.Kamen 1977, p. 210-211. Charles II, King of Spain from 1665-1700\\\\. Charles II was crippled by both physical and mental disabilities, but his complacent administration's lack of interference in Catalonia was appreciated. Tensions between Catalonia's leadership and the Crown somewhat subsided during the same time period. Spanish punishments for the 1640 revolt were quite lenient. Since many leaders of the region had committed high treason which, by the standards of the era, could easily have led to their execution en masse, this leniency was appreciated. King Charles II came to the throne in the 1660s; while generally regarded by historians as an incompetent and ineffectual ruler, his lack of activity was considered a blessing in Catalonia. Rather than continue the centralization of government in Madrid, Charles II did little and let regions manage their own affairs. John of Austria the Younger (Don Juan Jos√©) was a popular viceroy who put important Aragonese and Catalan nobles in positions of power, earning the goodwill of the nobility. Feliu de la Pe√±a, an important Catalan noble, called Charles II \\"the best king Spain ever had.\\" In 1684, the fortunes of many Catalan peasants plummeted. Locust swarms ravaged crops, ruining farmers and disrupting the entire economy. The locusts continued to be a problem in the following years, and were especially virulent in 1687.Kamen 1977, p. 213. Quartering of soldiers Catalonia, in the northeast of Spain. The brown territory is French-controlled Roussillon. Relations between Spain and France were quite hostile in the 1680s. Between 1683-1684, France defeated Spain in the War of the Reunions, fought mostly in the Spanish Netherlands. King Louis XIV of France was an aggressive empire-builder who had been claiming border territories for France, notably in the states of (modern) Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries. Still angry at losses in the Spanish Netherlands, Spain joined the League of Augsburg, an alliance between many German states, Sweden, and Spain intended to defend against France. Fearing another French-Spanish war, the government sent Castilian troops to Catalonia to guard the border in 1687. However, government forts and barracks were in a state of ill-repair and unequipped to shelter thirty companies of horsemen, approximately 2,400 soldiers total.Dant√≠ 1979, p. 87. Dant√≠ gives the number of companies as 33, and the soldiers the more specific 2,431; Kamen gives the 30 companies / 2400 soldiers estimate. As a result, a majority of the soldiers were quartered in civilian homes. A \\"military contribution\\" (a tax, but not named as such) was required to fund them, and the soldiers needed to eat. The abysmal harvest of 1687, compounded by already low food supplies, pushed much of the countryside to the point of desperation. Peasants protested to the government, asking for the soldiers to leave.Kamen 1977, p. 214. Three members of the Diputaci√≥ del General (the highest constitutional body of Catalonia) forwarded these complaints to King Charles II: Anton Sayol, Daniel Sayol, and Josep Sitges. The Viceroy of Catalonia, the Marquis of Legan√©s, responded by arresting and replacing the three diputats. The situation took a turn for the worse on October 7, 1687 in Centelles. Centelles was already unhappy; conflict had been incubating here between the unpopular Count of Centelles (Francesc Xavier de Blanes i Carr√≥s) and the residents.Albareda 2007, p. 314. A new provocation occurred when an army cavalryman struck a woman during an argument over a chicken.Dant√≠ 1979, p. 89. She immediately rallied the town in defiance. Seeking to defuse the situation, the cavalry withdrew from the town, but discontent continued to increase. After a meeting, many towns decided to accept the continued quartering of troops, but refuse to pay the military contribution to fund them. Another altercation between the military and the citizenry occurred on April 4, 1688 in Villamayor. In response, a ragtag militia marched on Matar√≥, an important port town, and entered on April 6. There, they rang church bells and rallied the population with cries of \\"\\" (\\"Long live the land!\\")Kamen 1980, p. 215. The leading citizens were found and compelled to argue the case of the rioters (they were threatened with the burning of their homes). Continuing to grow, the militia now marched on Barcelona, the regional capital, with an estimated 18,000 people. Their demands were a general pardon for any actions the militia made against the soldiers, a reduced military contribution, the pardon of the three imprisoned members of the Diputaci√≥, and the release of an imprisoned official Pedro Llosas. By Monday April 12, the government completely capitulated. The militia was easily supplied from the countryside and the city of Barcelona was at its mercy for its own supplies. With their demands sated, the peasants went back to their homes.Kamen 1977, p. 216. A letter written to the king on April 14 from government officials in Barcelona shows the dire state of affairs: Discontent spreads The War of the Grand Alliance started in 1688 with a French invasion of southern Germany states. The French attacked Spain in the Spanish Netherlands in 1689, and sent only a smaller force across the Pyrenees into Catalonia. The upper classes remained alarmed at the spontaneous outburst, and the administration was concerned that Barcelona could fall at a moment's notice. In fear of the militia returning to Barcelona, the three imprisoned members of the Diputaci√≥ were restored on May 10. The Viceroy, finding the situation too stressful, left office in a huff. He was replaced by the Count of Melgar. Incidents continued between the soldiers and the peasantry, and the government's control of the countryside became tenuous at best.Kamen 1977, p. 218. Despite the concessions, people now wanted to be exempt from any governmental demands and refused to pay taxes. 800 segadors (\\"reapers;\\" the term rebel farmers adopted) marched on Puigcerd√† and ordered that no one should work unless they received a minimum wage of 4 reales, inspiring similar incidents in other towns as the idea spread.Dant√≠ 1979, p. 92. Clergy became involved in disputes with the citizenry over tithes, sparking a riot on June 13. On June 14, rioters opened an armory and armed the citizenry. The rioters relaxed the next day, the feast of Corpus Christi; this gave soldiers the opportunity to sneak into the armory and defeat the budding revolt. Four popular leaders were hanged on July 5, and four more on August 9, but nevertheless a constellation of uprisings took place across Catalonia. Riots even struck Barcelona itself. Most uprisings were small in scale and targeted against upper class Catalans exempt from the military contribution, or against unpopular citizens who no longer had the protection of a working government such as bankers, tax collectors, and moneylenders.Kamen 1977, p. 219. In December 1688, the Viceroy of Catalonia changed again as the Count of Melgar retired and was replaced by the Duke of Villahermosa. The European political situation had continued to worsen, and war with France now seemed inevitable as the French attacked Spain's German allies. It was necessary to prepare Catalonia's defenses, as they were still in a lamentable state. Funding continued to be a problem, though. The Viceroy decided to try a \\"voluntary donation\\" () to reconstruct defenses and bolster the soldiers in March 1689. The Consell de Cent (Barcelona's ruling council) and the Catalan Estates approved this measure; the Viceroy assumed that the donation would be better received if it had a local stamp of approval. This proved ineffective, as the donation was reviled as a new tax by the Catalan peasantry. The donation revealed a major class divide; higher classes were exempt from the donation, which kept them largely content. This was a reversal from the 1640 revolt, in which nearly all of Catalan society had protested Spanish taxation.Kamen 1977, p. 220. French involvement, and open rebellion Leaders of the segadors had been in contact with French agents even before the donativo voluntario was announced. The donativo gave the French a powerful tool to encourage the protest against the quartering of soldiers and taxes to become a genuine rebellion. Money was sent to print leaflets denouncing the donation and the Spanish government. France had acquired the Catalan-speaking Roussillon in the 1640 Catalan Revolt, and some families had members on both sides of the border. These proved useful contacts; one noble, Sieur Gabriel Gervais, was related to rebel Joseph Rocafort and helped pass money and supplies to him across the mountains. Ram√≥n de Trobat, intendant of Roussillon, wrote polemics and began to swear rebel leaders to the loyalty of France, notably Rocafort and Enric Torras. With the countryside infuriated with the government, the donation was a failure. The viceroy suspended it.Kamen 1977, p. 222-223. Historian Henry Kamen believes that if the French had invaded in April 1689, with the donativo still fresh in the Catalans' memory, they could have \\"effortlessly\\" captured all of Catalonia.Kamen 1977, p. 224. The French used a rather more cautious strategy, however, taking the fortifications of Camprodon on the border on May 22 and stopping there. Possible reasons include that the commanders in Paris simply didn't realize how well their agents had succeeded, that they were more worried about the German theater of the war, or that they thought the rebels would win without need for an expensive supporting invasion. The leaflets generated continued unrest, but without a full invasion no outright uprising occurred. The French abandoned Camprodon in June, and the Spanish army retook their own fortress and destroyed it.Kamen 1980, p. 379. Official records contain no further incidents until October 1689, when a native of Centellas, Joan Castell√≥, was arrested in October for having persuaded peasants to not pay the donativo. Under torture, he implicated Enric Torras and others in the movement, and was then executed. In November, some of the cavalry were set upon by peasants and forced to give up their arms and horses. There was no attempt made to kill them, but only to disarm them. This trend spread quickly, with the disarmed soldiers encouraged to return to Barcelona. This would instigate the phase of the protests that became closest to an actual rebellion. Seeking to defuse the situation, the viceroy decided upon punitive reprisals. He sent a force of 800 cavalry, 500 infantry, and 2 artillery pieces to raze Sant Feliu de Llobregat. In reply, the peasant militia cut off the water supply to Barcelona. They were driven away, but now the segadors were up in arms. A large peasant militia calling itself the \\"Army of the Land\\" and numbering approximately 8,000 marched on Barcelona again, as they had a year earlier. The Viceroy engaged the peasants in battle this time; while the peasants won the first battle thanks to weight of numbers, they fared less well in three further battles as the Viceroy continued to harass them .Kamen 1977, p. 225. Elsewhere, others rose in revolt, but the troops stationed in the villages struck back. These reprisals prevented the movement from gaining traction. Some 2,000 segadors attacked Matar√≥, but the viceroy's troops defeated them. 40 rebels were killed and 6 were enslaved to row on galleys. Other clashes occurred at Castellfollit de la Roca and Sarri√†. On November 30, 1689, the peasant militia besieging Barcelona, weary of constant raids, disbanded and melted back into the countryside. Anton Soler, a wealthy country gentleman who had been a leader of the rebels, was murdered by his own adopted sonKamen 1977 says \\"adopted son\\" (p. 226); Kamen 1980 says \\"adopted grandson.\\" (p. 218). for the monetary reward the government offered. Soler's head was taken to Barcelona and exposed in a cage on the wall of the Generalitat (the chief governmental building).Kamen 1977, p. 226. The French eventually did invade Catalonia, with their main advance in 1694. They were fully driven back by 1697. Sporadic incidents continued in 1690 and 1691, but the rebellion never again regained its strength after Soler's death and the breaking of the siege of Barcelona.Kamen 1980, p. 380-381. The swift and bloody reprisals combined with the offer of a general pardon from the viceroy for those who laid down their arms proved an effective measure to pacify the population. The good harvests of 1688 and 1689 made payment of taxes less onerous. Radical Catalan nationalist leaflets continued to be circulated by Trobat, but with less effectiveness. The Viceroy wrote in 1690 that the rebels were still a threat in the vicinity of Centelles, but that the rebels controlled (only) the mountains.Albareda, p. 323. From the letter: \\"Ocupan algunos la eminencia de aquellos montes en donde est√°n muy seguros y sonando en ellos caracoles y con gritos alteran gran parte de el pa√≠s y disponen los malos...\\" The French managed to convince the leading officials of the Duchy of Cardona to agree to rise up in revolt if the French army came close enough, which never occurred. The plot was discovered in December 1691, and the Cardona plotters hanged. A very small number of segadors joined and aided the French army, perhaps fleeing from feared reprisals, but by 1695 their number was estimated to be less than 90. Under French direction in 1694, there was an attempted insurrection in Sant Feliu de Llobregat and the fort of Corbera; later, in August, there was a riot in Tarragona led by a group called \\"The Poor.\\" None of these rebellions came to anything. More threatening was the actual French army, but by 1694 they were seen as unwelcome invaders by a substantial proportion of the populace. The French had also earned the enmity of Barcelona due to their indiscriminate naval bombardment the city on July 10, 1691. Barcelona's loyalty was rewarded by the government by allowing Barcelona's councilors to keep their hats on while in the presence of the king, and the Diputaci√≥ was granted the titles of \\"Most Illustrious\\" and \\"Most Faithful.\\" These symbolic gestures were considered quite significant at the time.Kamen 1977, p. 228. Local Catalan guerrillas (Miquelets) aided the Spanish regulars in driving the French out of Catalonia, and while achieving some early successes the French were eventually forced to retreat.Kamen 1977, p. 227.Kamen 1980, p. 382. Aftermath The main legacy of the Revolt of the Barretinas was an enduring anti-French sentiment in the Catalan leadership and intelligentsia. This would become relevant a decade later in 1700, when King Charles II died without a son. Charles' death triggered the War of the Spanish Succession. The two claimants were the French Philip, Duke of Anjou and the Austrian Emperor Leopold I. The Spanish government chose Philip; French King Louis XIV, Philip's grandfather, naturally supported his grandson as well. The Catalan upper classes, still distrustful of France from its efforts to stir the peasantry against them in 1689, had no love for Philip. He was \\"a king chosen by Castilians.\\"Kamen 1977, p. 230. In 1702, the cortes voted to recognize Leopold as king, and full-scale rebellion against Philip began in 1705 with the arrival of supporting Austrian troops. The war would continue for nine more years, until the Siege of Barcelona in 1714 when the last remaining Catalan supporters of Leopold were defeated by the combined Franco- Castilian army. The Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip from 1707-1714, ended the nominal split between Castile and Aragon and eliminated the traditional autonomy Aragon had kept. Castilian law and institutions were mandated throughout Spain. See also * Second Brotherhood, a similar revolt in Valencia in 1693 Notes 1.

In September 2013 the Bauer Media Group, its last owner, ceased publishing the magazine. History and profile The magazine asserted that its war stories were true and that their underlying message was one of peace. In fact many of their stories came with disclaimer reminding the reader of the horrors of war. Critics, however, dismissed such claims as pure lip service to avoid getting indexed by West Germany's Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons which started to index several of their editions in the 1950s.Corinna Bochmann: Jugendgef√§hrdende Medien im Rechtsextremismus aus Sicht der BPJM (PDF).

He was a prewar lancer who used his civilian engineering expertise to wrangle a transfer to aviation duty. Early life and service Guido Masiero was born into a middle-class family in Padova in the Kingdom of Italy on 24 August 1895. He studied engineering before joining the Italian Army's 5th \\"Novara\\" Lancers on 4 December 1913.Franks et al 1997, pp. 144-145. He used his technical knowledge as grounds for a transfer to the Italian Army's air service.Varriale 2009, p. 61. World War I aviation service Masiero began aviation schooling on 1 February 1915. On 1 August 1915, he was rated a qualified pilot on the Maurice Farman aircraft. He completed pilot's training and was assigned as a sergente to 7a Squadriglia (later to be redesignated 26a Squadriglia) reaching the front on 15 October 1915. He qualified as a Voisin pilot on 15 November 1915. In December 1915 Masiero began to fly a Voisin for 26a Squadriglia. He flew 58 reconnaissance sorties over the Carso and sometimes returned with battle damage. At some point prior to February 1917, Guido Masiero was commissioned as a sottotenente. After the squadron was disbanded on 4 March 1917, Masiero was hastily reassigned to 103a Squadriglia at Brindisi. He then transferred to the Nieuport training unit at Malpensa on 14 May 1917. On 29 July 1917, he was promoted to tenente. Next, on 10 September 1917, he was forwarded to the 86a Squadiglia at Ponte San Pietro for further training on the new Ansaldo SVAs. As the SVAs were still under development, Masiero was sent to 91a Squadiglia on 27 October 1917. This was cut short by demands for all pilots to fight in the Battle of Caporetto; Masiero arrived on 2 November 1917 with 78a Squadriglia. On 7 November 1917, Masiero staked his first victory claim, but it went unconfirmed. He then joined with Mario Fucini, Razzi, and Antonio Chiri for his first official victory on 13 November 1917. Six days later, he scored a solo win, but his second claim on the 19 November went unconfirmed, as did one submitted for the following day. It was not until 10 December 1917 that he scored again, to balance out his count of confirmed and unconfirmed wins at three each. Four days later, another claim went unconfirmed. Finally, on 26 December 1917, in two separate fights, Masiero became an ace, sharing both victories with a number of other Allied pilots. Masiero was promoted to tenente from sottotentente on 17 January 1918. He would go on to make six more victory claims during the first six months of 1918, to no avail. On 29 March 1918, he left 78a Squadriglia for posting to 3a Sezione SVA to fly the new Ansaldo SVAs. A review committee meeting immediately postwar disallowed at least six previously confirmed victories, leaving Masiero's tally at five confirmed. Post-World War I In December 1918, the month after World War I ended, Masiero was assigned to the Experimental Directorate of the Italian Army's air service. He would spend a year there before his military discharge. Masiero had built a reputation for both piloting and technical expertise that saw him part of his country's postwar aviation mission to France, as well as participating in the ELTA Aeronautical Exhibition in Amsterdam. He was the pilot of one of 11 Italian planes that took off on 14 February 1920 for a long-distance flight from Rome to Tokyo. During the trip, he had to take a train in British India from Delhi to Calcutta to pick up a spare Ansaldo SVA after his original SVA became unserviceable, but he was one of only two pilots to complete the journey, arriving on 31 May 1920 and landing just after fellow SVA pilot Arturo Ferrarin. On 16 July 1935, now-Capitano Masiero was recalled from the Italian Air Force reserve to serve in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in the 20th Stormo. He flew both ground-attack and bombing missions in Romeo Ro.1s, IMAM Ro.37s, and Caproni Ca 101s. He served in Ethiopia until 18 November 1936, then returned to Italy. He received a Silver Medal for Military Valor for his service in the Ethiopian campaign. After returning to Italy, he served in two ground-attack units, the 5th and 50th Stormos. In 1937, Masiero volunteered to serve in Italy's Aviazione Legionaria (\\"Aviation Legion\\") in the Spanish Civil War under the nom de guerre \\"Guido Magoni\\". He arrived in Spain in October 1937. This time, he flew combat in a Breda Ba.65 until April 1938. Following this stint of service, which ended on 31 May 1938, Masiero joined Breda as chief test pilot; he also designed two planes that were never built. After Italy entered World War II in June 1940, Masiero volunteered to fly a Junkers Ju 87 dive bomber in combat, but was refused. It was felt that his services as test pilot for Breda were more important to Italy's war effort. Masiero was killed while flying in heavy fog in a Macchi C.202 fighter on 24 November 1942 when he collided with Francesco Agello over Milan. Agello also was killed.Varriale 2009, p. 62.earlyaviators.com Schubert, Jim, \\"Book Report: Italian Aviators Rome to Tokyo in 1920 by Lt. Gen'l. (Ret.)

Water Storage The water industry began using flexible membranes in the 1950s. Advantages over rigid storage systems include low cost, less algae growth, lower groundwater contamination, and less evaporation and seepage. Disadvantages include shorter life expectancy, greater susceptibility to damage, and more frequent maintenance requirements. Due to the structural limitations of flexible tanks, they tend to have a maximum recommended water storage capacity.

The regiment participated in the Second Afghan War of 1878-80 and after taking part in Lord Roberts' 'Kabul to Kandahar' march, fought at the Battle of Kandahar on 1 September 1880. In 1897, during a general uprising of Pashtun tribes, the regiment was stationed at Malakand. In July, the garrison was attacked by hostile tribesmen, who were repulsed after a fierce engagement. Lieutenant Edmund Costello was awarded the Victoria Cross for conspicuous gallantry during the action.

During the First World War the regiment served in Egypt and then in Mesopotamia, where it fought the Battles of Shaiba, Ctesiphon and the Siege of Kut al Amara in 1915, where it was captured by the Turks. The 24th Punjabis returned to Mesopotamia in April 1917, after reforming, and fought in the Battle of Khan Baghdadi. They later served in Salonika and the Russian Transcaucasia. Subsequent history In 1921‚Äì22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army, leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 14th Punjab Regiment, formed by grouping the 24th Punjabis with the 19th, 20th, 21st and 22nd Punjabis, and the 40th Pathans. The battalion's new designation was 4th Battalion 14th Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, the battalion fought in the Burma Campaign.Haig, Brodie. Fourteenth Punjab Regiment 1939-1945.

Violence Fight was later included in Taito Memories Vol. 2 for the PlayStation 2, and Taito Legends 2 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows. Violence Fight was also followed by a sequel released two years later titled as Solitary Fighter (known in Japan as ). Plot As the attract screen explains, the game takes place during the early 1950s in the United States, where an underground tournament known as the \\"Violence Fight\\" had become very popular among the criminal underworld and the public at large; criminals, especially mobsters, along with other public nuisances and upstanding citizens are allured by its stakes and thrill. The contestants, drawn from all across the country, compete for large sums of money and the title of \\"No. 1 Quarreler.\\" As the game begins, the tournament even attracts a young fighter named Bad Blue (or \\"Bat Blue\\") from Los Angeles who competes for the title of No. 1 Quarreler and aspires to share a small fortune with his manager, \\"Blinks.\\" Gameplay Violence Fight plays similarly to other beat 'em ups like Double Dragon, where the player can move in all eight directions in an arena fight. Also, there are three buttons: punch, kick and jump. However, unlike most side-scrolling fighters, the players fight in an enclosed arena space. Players can press either punch + jump or kick + jump to perform either a special punch or a special kick move. Players also can press punch + kick to duck for a short period of time. While the opponent is struggling to get up, the punch button can be used to throw him to the ground for some damage. The punch button is also used to pick up crates, barrels and other similar objects. Each match consists of up to three rounds. The timer will initially be set at 100 seconds, or 1 minute, 40 seconds. Your objective is to get your opponent's life meter to zero to win a round. Winning two out of three rounds will win the match. Each brawler begins the round with 100 health points. Direct hits to your opponent will reduce his health gradually, based on certain factors. For each round won, you gain one point towards winning the match. If time runs out in a round, the round will end in a draw. If two of three rounds end in a draw, the brawler with only one point will be the winner. If the point totals are tied at the end of all three rounds, the match ends in a draw. If you get more points than your opponent, you'll continue on to the next gameplay round, or \\"stage\\" of the game. If your opponent has more points than you, your game is over and you'll have the option of continuing the game, at the cost of one additional coin. If the match ends in a draw against the CPU, it will be the same as a loss. If the match ends in a draw of a 2-player match, either player will have to insert another coin to continue the single-player campaign. Characters There are four playable fighters, and two unplayable bosses. * ‚Äì A yester-year street-fighting champion from Los Angeles, California.

Subsequent history In 1921-22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 15th Punjab Regiment, formed by grouping the 25th Punjabis with the 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th Punjabis. The battalion's new designation was 1st Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, the battalion fought in the Burma Campaign. In 1947, the 15th Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was merged with the 1st, 14th and 16th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment, and 1/15th Punjab was redesignated as 9 Punjab. During the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, it fought in Chhamb-Jaurian Sector, while in 1971, it fought in the Hussainiwala Sector.

The site is situated on a prominent hill of the same name, located between the gorges of the Mala and Golema rivers which meet form the Koƒçani River. Many fortification remnants are found on the hill. History In the early Antiquity, this area, which is geographically connected to the course of Bregalnica River or antic Astibos, was part of Paeonia, colonized by the Paeonian tribe known as the Derrones. During the Roman Period, reforms of the actual emperors concerning the administration led to minor state border changes. This is one reason the area was part of different provinces, such as Macedonia, Thracia, Macedonia Secunda, Dacia Mediteranea. Balkan provinces gained importance to the Roman Empire towards the close of the 3rd and the 4th century A.D., when the Empire suffered great changes in the fields of economics, politics, and administration. At that time, the building of a new, strong defensive system in Macedonia commenced. Its main role was to protect the region from advancing northern tribes. Many remnants of that system can be seen even today. The collapse of the local borders down the course of Bregalnica is associated with the close of Antique. This is the period when fortification and restoration of existing defensive walls of important settlements began. The site of Dolno Gradishte is one of those renewed settlements. Exploration First written data about this site had been found in writings of the archaeologist M. Garashanin in 1959, and then, in 1964, A. Keramidchiev mentioned it in the writings about recognitions he had made throughout eastern part of Macedonia. The excavations in 2004 were the first exploring activities with a purpose to prevent the site from the construction of the local road which connects Koƒçani to the village Jastrebnik. The fortification occupies an area of around 1,5 ha and has wide defensive walls that enclose an irregular form with dimensions of 200x100/50 meters. A high eastern acropolis with traces of medieval defensive tower dominates over a wide dwelling terrace, located eastern and southern of the acropolis. Many of the remnants found at the terrace are parts of the wall that followed the west side up to the north-western forehead, where remnants of another medieval defensive tower were found. Many traces of objects used for living are located in the base of the east side of the north-western tower. Especially noteworthy is the fact that their base are built up in the cliff. Artifacts The site is rich in constructional ceramics decorated with various engraved ornaments, while fragments with engraved horizontal and defending lines in many different variants prevail at the clay pottery. It is important to mention that medieval sgraffito plates and objects made of tilled animal bones were also found here. Besides the pottery and the ceramics used for building, a great amount of slag was also discovered. The site \`Zgurite\` is close to this one and they used to be connected with an old antic path. This is one of the reasons why is believed that the site is an old mining settlement which is associated to the Osogovo region rich in mineral deposits. The existence of necropolis near the fortification is just another prove of the constant settlement which was situated here.

The two countries established diplomatic relations on November 23, 1949.Albania Albania has an embassy in Beijing and China has an embassy in Tirana.  History  Early stage of diplomatic relations When the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in 1956 , Mao Zedong met with Enver Hoxha . The two countries established diplomatic relations on November 23, 1949. Since 1954, the People's Republic of China has provided economic assistance to Albania.ÊúÄÂ†µÂøÉÂ§ñ‰∫§Ôºö‰∏≠ÂõΩÊè¥Âä©ÈòøÂ∞îÂ∑¥Â∞º‰∫ö On October 29, 1958, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China approved Chen Yi and Li Fuchun 's \\"Report on Strengthening the Leaders of Foreign Economic and Technical Assistance Work\\". The instructions stated: \\"Conscientiously doing a good job in foreign economic and technical assistance is a serious political task, and it is also an internationalist obligation that our people owe to the people of fraternal countries and nationalist countries.\\" Positioning foreign economic assistance as politics task.

However, after Stalin's death, Khrushchev , who succeeded as the first secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, completely rejected Stalin's policy and fixed relations with Yugoslavia. Albania opposed Khrushchev's approach for its own interests. During the same period, China also criticized the new soviet government of khruschev and severed diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂØπÈòøÂ∞îÂ∑¥Â∞º‰∫öÁöÑÊè¥Âä© ÁéãÊ¥™Ëµ∑ „ÄäÁÇéÈªÑÊò•Áßã„Äã 2008Âπ¥10Êúü Building close relationships At the Bucharest Conference held on June 20-25, 1960 , the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist or Workers‚Äô Party of pro-Soviet socialist countries launched an attack on China. The Albanian Labor Party, which chose to stand on the same front with the CCP, was also criticized by the Soviet Union. In early June before the meeting, when the leaders of the Communist Party of China met with the leaders of the Albanian Party of Labor, they explained the differences of opinion between the Chinese and Soviet Communist Parties and their own opinions. From June 5th to 9th, the eleventh meeting of the Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions was held in Beijing. At the meeting, the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist government had different opinions. On June 17, the delegation of the Council of the Chinese and Soviet Union of Trade Unions met. The representatives of the Soviet Union accused the Chinese Communist government and Albania of opening up the differences between the two parties and attempting to split the international communist movement. At the Bucharest Conference on June 20, Khrushchev first attacked the policies of the CCP, including \\"supporting the policies of the Stalin era to subvert the Soviet Union\\" and \\"domestic policy errors such as the Great Leap Forward\\". After the Bulgarian participant‚Äôs speech in support of the Soviet Union ended, the spokesperson of the Albanian Party stated that the differences between the Chinese and Soviet parties can be resolved in the discussion and should not be discussed in such a meeting. And in the discussion that followed, he clearly supported the CCP.

Therefore, the Soviet Union unilaterally tore up the economic and military assistance contract to Albania in 1961, refused its participation in the Warsaw Pact meeting and eventually broke off diplomatic relations with it. The diplomatic relations between China and Albania have been strengthened. When Premier Zhou Enlai visited Albania, Albania held a mass welcome rally of more than 100,000 people every time, and leaders often all welcome them. When the Albanian leaders visited China, all party and state leaders except Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China greeted them at the airport. They also organized millions of people in Beijing to welcome them. ÊúÄÂ†µÂøÉÂ§ñ‰∫§Ôºö‰∏≠ÂõΩÊè¥Âä©ÈòøÂ∞îÂ∑¥Â∞º‰∫ö  Start of large-scale economic and material assistance by communist China  thumb|250pxZhou En Lai visiting Albania in 1963 After the strengthening of the relationship between the governments of the two countries, the aid standards began to increase substantially. In 1961, during the Great Chinese Famine , China provided Albania with hundreds of thousands of tons of grain , 250 million yuan in foreign exchange aid, and 19 complete projects. Among them, part of the food is still in the three-year difficult period due to food shortages, and plans to buy from Canada. At the request of the Albanian side, the Chinese Communist government ordered the shipment of grain from Canada to Albania. After the Seven Thousand Cadres Conference in 1962 , Wang Jiaxiang suggested that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China \\"seek truth from facts and do what we can.\\" This was criticized by Mao Zedong. Wang Jiaxiang was removed from the post of head of the International Department of the Central Committee . When Geng Biao was the Albanian ambassador (around 1969), China's economic and military assistance projects to Albania were worth nearly 9 billion yuan, and caused a lot of waste. In 1969, investment in non- production construction projects in Albania accounted for 24% of the country‚Äôs total investment, resulting in a serious shortage of labor. The machinery and materials aided by China were used for non-production purposes (such as cement used to make a large number of monuments) and placed randomly, causing serious losses. Albania even used the machinery and raw materials provided by China to produce a large number of inferior products and sell them back to China. At the same time, China assisted in the construction of chromium and nickel mining projects in Albania, and provided China with chromium, nickel and other strategic materials that were scarce at that time, but it also caused overproduction.

The \\"Congratulatory Message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour\\" issued by the Communist Party of China in the name of Mao Zedong said \\"Albania of the heroic people has become a great lamp of socialism in Europe\\". Soon after, the relevant content and paragraphs of the congratulatory message were compiled into \\" Chairman Mao's Quotations Song \\", which was sung between China and Albania. The song was called \\"We Are Real Friends.\\" From then on, these sayings made of Albania were well-known in China. Rift to break in relationship In 1969, Mao Zedong worried about the Soviet Union's invasion of China and began to ease the diplomacy of the United States. In Albania, the meeting between Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Kosygin reduced the requirements for attending the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, which caused Mao Zedong‚Äôs dissatisfaction.Relations between the two countries began to cool. During the discussion of the draft joint statement in 1969, the Albanian side did not approve of China ‚Äôs suggestion that the source of revisionism should be written in the statement . Regarding whether there is a class issue in socialist countries, the two sides have different views. Since 1970, the relationship between the Communist Party of China and the Albanian Party of Labour has gradually come to a standstill. When China broke its diplomatic isolation in the early 1970s, Mao Zedong , Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other CCP leaders began to reconsider aid to Albania. The Chinese ambassador to Albania, Geng Biao, witnessed the current situation in Albania, and wrote about Albania‚Äôs massive waste of aid to Qiao Guanhua , the Deputy Minister of European Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , and Qiao forwarded it to Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong praised Geng Biao for reflecting the facts. However, the aid did not stop. In 1970, Albania asked China for 3.2 billion yuan in aid, and finally received 1.95 billion yuan in long-term low-interest loans. ‰∏éÊ≠§ÂêåÊó∂Ôºå‰∏≠ÂõΩÂØπÂ∑¥Âü∫ÊñØÂù¶Êè¥Âä©Áî±2‰∫øÂÖÉ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂ∏ÅÂ¢ûÂä†Âà∞5‰∫øÂÖÉ„ÄÇËá≥1973Âπ¥Ôºå‰∏≠ÂõΩÂØπÂ§ñÊè¥Âä©ÂàõÂéÜÂè≤ËÆ∞ÂΩïÔºåËææÂõΩÂÆ∂Ë¥¢ÊîøÊîØÂá∫ÁöÑ6%ÔΩû7%„ÄÇ On the other hand, Tirana under the leadership of Hoxha , the first secretary of the Albanian Party of Labour , began to improve its international status. Albania started trade negotiations with France , Italy and the newly independent Asian and African countries, and resumed normal relations with Yugoslavia and Greece in 1971 . Albania actively reduced its dependence on China by decentralizing trade channels, improving diplomatic and cultural relations (especially with Western European countries). But Albania did not join the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , and refused to participate in the Helsinki Conference held in July 1975 . Albanian leaders were dissatisfied that China resumed friendly relations with the United States in the early 1970s. The newspapers and radio stations in Tirana did not report Nixon's visit to China in 1972 . However, Albania which was still in the United Nations, submitted a draft resolution critical of the General Assembly, so that the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China to exercise power in the United Nations. In October 1974, Albania asked China to provide 5 billion yuan in loans, postpone the repayment of loans from 1976 to 1980, and asked China to provide grain and oil assistance. China was at the end of the Cultural Revolution at this time and only promised 1 billion yuan in loans. Albania has set off a movement to condemn China and refuse to provide the crude oil and asphalt that China needs . In 1975, the two countries signed a batch of long-term interest-free loan protocols. After Mao Zedong's death in 1976 , Hoxha remained optimistic about China-Albania relations. But in August 1977, the newly appointed Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council Hua Guofeng stated that he would use the Three World Theory as the basis for his new foreign policy. Hoxha regarded it as a way for China to unite with the United States to fight the Soviet Union and seek hegemony in the third world and non-aligned countries , and expressed firm opposition. From August 30 to September 7, 1977, Yugoslavian President Tito visited Beijing and was welcomed by the new leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Albanian Labor Party immediately declared China a revisionist country similar to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. China also found it difficult to meet Albania's huge assistance request, and the relationship between the two sides has fallen to a freezing point. On July 13, 1978, China announced the cessation of aid to Albania. In 1978, in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's instructions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued the \\"Notes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on Compulsory Suspension of Assistance to Albania and Reception of Experts\\", which formally terminated assistance to Albania. Enver Hoxha, the top leader of the Albanian government and the first secretary of the Labor Party , has since fully opposed the Chinese government.  The new pattern of diplomacy Since 1979, Albania has suspended all trade, cultural, educational, and technological relations with China, and only retained diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level. This \\"hibernation\\" state of China-Albania relations lasted until 1983. On November 23, 1989, the two countries signed an agreement to establish a China-Albania Economic and Technical Cooperation Mixed Committee. ‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÊîøÂ∫úÂíåÈòøÂ∞îÂ∑¥Â∞º‰∫öÁ§æ‰ºö‰∏ª‰πâ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩ ÊîøÂ∫úÂÖ≥‰∫éÂª∫Á´ã‰∏≠ÈòøÁªèÊµéÊäÄÊúØÂêà‰ΩúÊ∑∑ÂêàÂßîÂëò‰ºöÁöÑÂçèÂÆö In January 1991, Albanian Foreign Minister Malile visited China. This was the first senior official of the Albanian government to visit China since the deterioration of Sino-Albanian relations in 1978, but at that time the communist regime in Albania was facing disintegration. ‰∏≠ÈòøÊîøÊ≤ªÂÖ≥Á≥ª Influence on China regarding the aid of Albania During the Great Leap Forward, China's food aid to Albania directly reduced the amount of food in the country. China's other economic assistance to Albania has even exceeded the country's productivity and living standards. For example, according to Geng Biao's calculation in 1969, the CCP's economic and military assistance to Albania since 1954 was nearly 9 billion yuan. At that time, the total population of Albania was only 2 million, with an average of more than 4,000 yuan per person. At that time, the average annual income of China was only more than 200 yuan. The aid to Albania has actually placed a heavy burden on the government. ÊúÄÂ†µÂøÉÂ§ñ‰∫§Ôºö‰∏≠ÂõΩÊè¥Âä©ÈòøÂ∞îÂ∑¥Â∞º‰∫ö The breakdown of relations with China left Albania lacking foreign protection. Albania rejected the efforts of the United States and the Soviet Union to restore normal relations, while expanding diplomatic relations with Western Europe and developing countries, and began to adopt self-reliance as the basic strategy of national economic development. This turmoil and the debate on the three world theories divided the world anti-revisionist movement. Most anti-revisionist parties support the Albanian Party of Labour, while other parties dispute this. This view and theory is called Hoxhaism . The Albanian Labour Party‚Äôs allies are mainly distributed in Africa, Turkey and Latin America, including the Communist Party of Brazil and the Tigray Marxist Alliance . Albania's diplomatic moves regarding the one China policy Embassy of Albania in China From the 1960s onwards, the People's Republic of Albania under Enver Hoxha, moved an annual resolution in the General Assembly to transfer China's seat at the UN from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China. On October 25, 1971, Resolution 2758, sponsored by Albania, was passed by the General Assembly, withdrawing recognition of the ROC as the legitimate government of China, and recognizing the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China. China considers Albania an important part of its Belt and Road Initiative. Issue of human right in China  On 6 October 2020, a group of 39 countries, including Albania, Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., most of the EU member states, Bosnia, Canada, Haiti, Honduras, and Japan, made a statement at the United Nations to denounce China for its treatment of ethnic minorities and for curtailing freedoms in Hong Kong.  Agreements  In 2001, the two countries signed three agreements covering financial, mortgage and technical aspects of constructing a new hydroelectric power facility ‚Äîto be known as Hydro Central‚Äî in northern Albania. China also pledged US$126 million in credit to the project. Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha visited Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in April 2009. Wen put forth a four-point proposal to further cooperation with Albania. It urged both countries to:China offers four-point proposal to further relations with Albania * increase exchanges at all levels to cement political relations by using the opportunity of the 60th anniversary of Sino-Albanian ties; * promote substantial cooperation based on equality and reciprocity and put more emphasis on information technology, energy, infrastructure, and mining exploration; * expand cooperation in the areas of culture, public health, agriculture and tourism to enrich bilateral ties; * strengthen coordination in the United Nations and other international organizations to safeguard the interests of developing nations and unity of the United Nations.

Early history The regiment was raised by Captain HT Bartlett at Peshawar in June 1857, as the 18th Regiment of Punjab Infantry, during the upheaval of the Indian Mutiny. The manpower consisted of Pathans, Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Dogras. The regiment took part in the Bhutan War of 1864-66, the Second Afghan War of 1878-80 and the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885-87. In 1895, it took part in the Relief of Chitral, while in 1897, it operated with the Mohmand Field Force during the great tribal uprising on the North West Frontier of India. 26th Punjabis Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 26th Punjabis. 340px In 1911, the 26th Punjabis moved to Hong Kong to protect British interests following the Chinese Revolution of 1911. On the outbreak of the First World War, the regiment returned from Hong Kong to India. In December 1915, it sailed for Mesopotamia. During 1916, it fought on the Tigris Front in the Battles of Dujaila and Sannaiyat, as the British made desperate efforts to relieve their besieged garrison at Kut al Amara. In 1917, the regiment was again engaged in fighting on the River Tigris and took part in the British advance on Baghdad. In 1918, it moved to Persia, returning to India in October 1919. In 1918, the 26th Punjabis raised a second battalion, which was disbanded in 1922. Subsequent history In 1921-22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 15th Punjab Regiment, formed by grouping the 26th Punjabis with the 25th, 27th, 28th and 29th Punjabis. The battalion's new designation was 2nd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, the battalion fought in Borneo, where it was captured by the Japanese in March 1942. It was re-raised in 1946 as a Machine-Gun Battalion. In 1947, the 15th Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was merged with the 1st, 14th and 16th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment, and 2/15th Punjab was redesignated as 10 Punjab. The battalion fought in Kashmir during the 1948 war with India. During the 1965 Indo- Pakistan War, it fought at Suleimanki, while in 1971, it served in the Rajasthan Sector.

Fidler belongs to the group of ceramicists who worked in the era called the ¬´ Golden Years of Vallauris ¬ª, and he is also known as a painter, for his collages and water colours. His works have been purchased by collectors all over the world. He also showed them in France and abroad. Biography Fidler was born in Balti, then a Jewish and Russian settlement in Bessarabia in 1910. The family moved to Warsaw where his younger sister, Aline, who was to become a pianist was born in 1917. In 1918 his family came as refugees and settled in Nice, France. From 1918-1928 he attended primary and secondary schools in Switzerland and Germany, and then the Lycee Massena in Nice. From 1928-1930 Fidler served his military service in the French Army, thus becoming a French citizen. From 1930‚Äì1937 he studied art at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, and later at the Acad√©mie Julian. In 1937 he returned to Nice, following the death of his father, Aron Fidler. In 1940 Fidler married Edith Giler, a refugee who had fled Nazi Germany with her family, and settled in Mougins. At this time he began to learn the art of ceramics. The couple escaped from the French Riviera when the Nazis took over Free France in 1943, finding shelter in Roussillon under the assumed Gentile name of Fournier to evade the Vichy antisemitic laws and round-ups. He painted and made ceramics with his wife, producing small objects like buttons, earrings and necklaces. While holding showing, under the assumed name of Fournier, he met Samuel Beckett and painter Henri Hayden, also refugees on the run. In 1944 when Provence was liberated. The Fidlers returned to Mougins, where he and Edith turned out utilitarian objects like vases, ashtrays, dishes and candle-holders. A daughter, Catherine, was born in 1947, but the couple divorced in 1950 and Fidler moved to Paris where he would works for the next couple of years. In 1952 Fidler resettled in Vallauris where he has regular shows of his work. At this period he became friends with Picasso and Jacqueline Roque.Sally H. Fairweather, Pablo Picasso, Carl Nesjar Picasso's concrete sculptures 1982 \\"Eugene Fidler spoke up, saying that he and Edith knew Picasso and Jacqueline Roque, having made friends with them in Vallauris, where both men had been working in ceramics. Since the summer of 1954, he told Carl, Picasso and Jacqueline ...\\" In 1956 he married his second wife, Edith Ramos, from the Azores, his student in ceramics and then co- worker. The couple had a daughter, Nathalie, in 1956. Fidler returned again to Roussillon in 1959, while travelling frequently across Europe and the Americas. He remained there painting and producing ceramics pieces in Roussillon-en-Provence until his death in 1990.  Works  Fidler worked with many different painting techniques, including oil, water colours, inks, engraving, etching, pencils, and even the basic felt pens, but it is certainly that of the collage which he has explored the most. Setting himself apart from the trends and fashions of the times, he developed his own artistic style, finding his inspiration in his personal mythology, and background, as well as in the discoveries he made when travelling. For his work as a ceramicist he used mostly grog (also called firesand or chamotte). He never used the wheel, but built up his pieces by hand, in the traditional way. He was a friend of the group of ceramicists called ‚ÄòLe Tryptique‚Äô, and was one of those who experimented various techniques for firing, and glazing.Anne Lajoix The Golden Years of Vallauris He also produced much larger pieces for the lobby of a private residence in Cannes, or for the schoolyard of a school in the Paris area.

The original fortress was built in 1472 near Bovec on the road between Cave del Predil and Carinthia. Its likely original purpose was defence of Friuli against the Turks. In the course of the 16th century Bovec came under Austrian authority as a result of the wars between Venice and the Habsburgs. However, for the time being it remained as an ecclesiastical dependence of Cividale and Aquileia. At the end of the 18th century it was entirely under Austria's administration, and remained so until 1918. In 1796 and 1797 fighting took place around the fort, as Napoleon's army pushed through the Koritnica gorge. Napoleon's forces took the fort in 1797 by placing artillery at a higher elevation (where Fort Hermann now stands). The fortress was then destroyed. The current fort was built upon the site by the Austrians in the late 19th century. Fort Hermann, covering the higher elevation, was built at the same time. The two are linked by a trail and a tunnel. Fort Hermann was heavily damaged and rendered unusable by Italian artillery bombardment in 1915. In 1903 part of Bovec was destroyed by a fire. What remained standing was ravaged in World War I, when the Italian-Austrian front (Battles of the Isonzo) crossed through the valley as the battle cut from north to south.

Early history The regiment was raised during the upheaval of the Indian Mutiny, at Rawalpindi on 19 June 1857, as the Regiment of Rawalpindi. In 1860, it was sent to China to fight in the Second Anglo-China War. In 1861, the regiment was permitted to use the Royal Cypher within the Garter on its appointments for its meritorious services. During the Second Afghan War of 1878-80, as part of the Peshawar Valley Field Force, it advanced into the Khyber Pass to clear Afghan forces at Ali Masjid. In 1885, the regiment participated in the Third Burma War. In 1901, the 27th Punjab Infantry was dispatched to British Somaliland to suppress the resistance movement led by the Somali religious leader Abdullah Hassan of the Dervish State. 27th Punjabis Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 27th Punjabis. During the First World War, the infantrymen served on the North West Frontier of India, Egypt, France and Mesopotamia. The regiment raised a second battalion in 1918, which was disbanded after the war. Subsequent history In 1921-22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 15th Punjab Regiment, formed by grouping the 27th Punjabis with the 25th, 26th, 28th and 29th Punjabis. The battalion's new designation was 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, the battalion served in British Somaliland, Aden, Persia, Iraq, Syria and Italy. It was converted into a Machine-Gun Battalion in 1946. In 1947, the 15th Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was merged with the 1st, 14th and 16th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment, and 3/15th Punjab was redesignated as 11 Punjab. During the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, it was deployed in the Sylhet Sector of East Pakistan, while in 1971, it served in the Shakargarh Sector.

History In the 12th century Robert de Chesney, Bishop of Lincoln granted land at Clattercote to the Gilbertine Order, on which they founded a small priory dedicated to Saint Leonard.Crossley, 1972, pages 194-197 The priory was dissolved in 1538 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1551 King Henry VIII granted the former priory and its lands to Christ Church, Oxford. The college was still the freeholder in 1969. The Priory seems to have had a leper's pool in which leprous inmates were bathed. Remains of a paved walk around the former pool have been discovered. By the 18th century the leper's pool was known as the \\"great fish pond\\". The priory was extensively rebuilt as a moated farmhouse, Priory Farm. The eastern range of the farmhouse includes parts of the priory dating from late in the 13th or early in the 14th century. By 1614 the remainder of the priory had been demolished and replaced with a large L-shaped house. The central wing of this house survives but by 1717 the west wing had been demolished. The present west wing had been built in its place by 1729. In 1777 the Oxford Canal was being extended southwards past Clattercote from Fenny Compton in Warwickshire to Cropredy in Oxfordshire,Compton, 1976, page 25 and the canal company enlarged the great fish pond to form Clattercote Reservoir to feed the canal. In 1787 the company enlarged the reservoir to its present area of . There is a Clattercote Wharf on the canal about east of Priory Farm. In 1852 the Great Western Railway built its Oxford and Rugby Railway from to past Clattercote, passing just west of Priory Farm. Clattercote's nearest station was to the south at , until British Railways closed it in 1956. In 1932 Clattercote and the neighbouring village of Claydon to the north were incorporated into the new Claydon with Clattercot civil parish.

The first section of the route was opened between Hexham and Chollerford in 1858, the remainder opening in stages until completion 1862. The line was closed to passengers by British Railways in 1956. The station had a single platform and a tall signal box. This was a fairly substantial station having a waggonway branch, which ran from here up Slater's incline, to the Plashetts and Far Colliery. To the north of the station were one or two houses and at the end of the waggonway a miners' village. The station is now submerged beneath Kielder Water.

Conceived in 1934 by Sir Eric Geddes, chairman of Imperial Airways, EAMS sought to greatly expand British civil aviation by shifting all ‚Äòfirst class‚Äô mail within the British Empire by air. Imperial Airways was a private company, but like most airlines of the era, relied on public subsidies (in this case, from the Air Ministry) to support its operations.Davies, 1964, pp59-60 A critical driving force behind EAMS was Sir Christopher Llewellyn Bullock K.C.B, C.B.E., Permanent Under-Secretary at the British Air Ministry from 1931 to 1936. Appointed at the age of 38, he remains one of the youngest civil servants to have headed a British Government department.Chapman, Richard A. Ethics in the British Civil Service, 1988 , p. 142 EAMS was a hugely expensive plan, and to make it financially acceptable to the British Government, subsidies were required to support it from the ‚ÄòDominions‚Äô (especially South Africa, India and Australia), and the colonies of the Empire. In this way, EAMS served another of Geddes‚Äô aims, namely to prevent local Indian, South African and Australian operators from opening up international air routes.Ewer, 2009, Chapter 3 Political agreement from within the Empire was finally reached in early 1937, after the Australians held out for a better financial deal. Australian aviation experts were deeply sceptical about the Scheme from the start, and were especially concerned that Imperial Airways had decided on the use of flying boats to operate the new services, even before final agreement was reached. Geddes preferred flying boats because he thought the cost of expanding airfields throughout the Empire would be too great, and the cost of fuel would be lower along the coastline in comparison with inland airfields. The use of flying boats quickly exposed the frailties of the Scheme once it became operational. The first service from Alexandria, Egypt began in December 1936, and that to Durban, South Africa commenced the following year.Barnes, 1989, pp318-21 However, the service to Australia did not begin until July 1938, owing to difficulties in building alighting stations in the difficult geographic and climatic conditions in northern Australia. The Short C Class ‚ÄòEmpire‚Äô boats were over-weight, meaning their useful load and hence profitability were down on specification, and structurally weak, so that the aircraft were easily damaged.Smith, 1983 In December 1938, the Scheme was wracked by crisis, as the fragile Shorts flying boats went out of service due to accidents and maintenance problems, while the cheap subsidised mail rates offered to the public attracted a flood of letters that the British Air Ministry never expected. To shift this huge quantity of mail while their own fleet steadily diminished, Imperial Airways scoured Europe for aircraft on short term leases, including American Douglas airliners from Swissair.Ewer, 2009, p86 An official review of the Scheme in early 1939 then concluded that the amount of mail to be carried at peak times like the Christmas season could never be lifted without an uneconomic number of ‚Äòreserve‚Äô aircraft that would then be idle for the rest of the year.Ewer, 2007 The outbreak of the war in September 1939 brought the Scheme to an end; by then, British officials had concluded the original selection of flying boats was a mistake, and British aviation needed to shift back to landplanes.Ewer, 2007 However, the demands of war prevented British industry from building new prototype landplanes for which orders had been placed, the Fairey FC1 and the Short S32.Barnes, 1989, p341 References Bibliography *Christopher Barnes (1989) Shorts Aircraft since 1900, London: Putnam *R.E.G.

His father, Jean, was a doctor of repute; his grandfather, a minister of the reformed religion, was descended from a family of B√©arn, settled in La Rochelle. He was sent at the age of sixteen to the Academy of Saumur for courses in philosophy and history. Louis Cappel taught him Hebrew. He went to Paris in 1664, and became acquainted with Isaac Vossius, who took him to Holland. Here he lived twelve months and brought out Gallia Orientalis (1665), his first work, dealing with the lives and writings of Frenchmen who had distinguished themselves in Hebrew and oriental studies. It covered 152 scholars, concentrating on those with competence in Hebrew, and included both Catholics and Protestant. The work was dedicated to Samuel Bochart.http://people.mcgill.ca/files/nicholas.dew/Dew-sample.pdf, p. 32 The original project included Belgian, German, English, and other sections; Italia et Hispania Orientalis was a posthumous publication. He returned to La Rochelle, where he remained until 1681, and wrote several books. He then came to England, visited Vossius, who had been a resident since 1670, and had become canon of Windsor, and he obtained the post of reader in the French Anglican church established by Peter Allix. Vossius introduced him to William Sancroft, who collated him (after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685), to the rectory of Eynesford in Kent on 18 November 1687, having previously made him a librarian (perhaps assistant to Henry Wharton, recruited by Sancroft at the same period) at Lambeth Palace. He retired on the deprivation of Sancroft in 1690, and Wharton still retained the office. He was naturalised in 1688. While in England he published works which were heavily criticized by Pierre Jurieu and others. He was on the point of going to Germany to become librarian to Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp when illness overtook him. He died in London 4 January 1692, aged 54, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields.

At present there are approximately 60 students in each batch. History The Department of Computer Engineering was established in the Faculty of Engineering in Peradeniya in 1985. Although it is the youngest department in the Faculty, it is the oldest Computer Engineering Department to be established in the University system of the country. The main function of the department initially was to conduct programming courses to the students in all disciplines of the Faculty. Over the years the department has developed into a fully-fledged department and it now offers several courses in Computer Engineering to the students. The demand from the students for Computer Engineering has been high and a limited number is admitted to follow it. The graduates who have specialized in Computer Engineering are highly sought after by local as well as foreign employers. In view of the good employment prospects for Computer Engineering graduates and the large demand from the students, the department has initiated a degree programme leading to the B.Sc. Eng. degree in Computer Engineering from year 2001. The Department has also been building up its resources and now has state of the art technology in networking, digital design, embedded systems and computer interfacing. Vision To be a competitive teaching entity in computer engineering in the country and the region and to produce graduates with international recognition for their knowledge and skills, who are capable of taking a leadership position in the board aspect of computer engineering. Mission The mission of the Department is to keep the academic and research programmes on a par with internationally recognized programmes in the discipline incorporating the rapid changes taking place in the industry, train the students to acquire the required scientific and technological knowledge and skills, and to develop their soft skills, thus enhancing their professional recognition, career prospects and career mobility, nationally and internationally. The department intends to achieve these by making sure that the graduates: #understand the basic principles that underlie present electronic and computational technology; #are capable of creatively applying their understanding of science and engineering principles to solve problems typical of the career they choose; #are competent in communicating their ideas clearly and succinctly in all forms; #and are motivated to engage in lifelong learning which will be essential for progressing in their career.

Early history In 1858, Major John Jacob raised two local 'silladar' infantry battalions known as Belooch Rifles (re-designated as Jacob's Rifles soon after); the only silladar infantry to have existed in the Indian Army. These battalions soon earned a formidable reputation in and around Jacobabad for keeping the peace on the Sindh frontier as part of the Sind Frontier Field Force. In 1861, the first of these was accorded regular status, becoming the 30th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry or Jacob's Rifles, while the second was disbanded.

In 1881, it was reconstituted as a Baluch battalion and re-designated as the 30th Regiment (Jacob's) Bombay Native Infantry or 3rd Belooch Regiment. In 1900, it was sent to China to suppress the Boxer Rebellion.Cadell, Sir Patrick. (1938). History of the Bombay Army. Longmans & Green.Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (1998).

In 1906, the Prince of Wales (later George V) was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment. The regimental full dress uniform in 1914 included a rifle green turban and kurta (knee length tunic) piped in red, worn with red trousers and white gaiters. The red trousers were a distinctive feature of all five Baluch infantry regiments then serving in the Indian Army.Barthorp, Michael; Jeffrey Burn (1979). Indian Infantry Regiments 1860‚Äì1914. p. 32.

The regiment's new designation was 5th Battalion (King George's Own) 10th Baluch Regiment (Jacob's Rifles). During the Second World War, 5/10th Baluch served in Burma Campaign. The battalion's performance in the war was highly commendable. It suffered a total of 575 casualties and received a number of gallantry awards.

We don't believe as individual companies we can stem the avalanche of news stories about Australia producing nothing but cheap industrial wines. But together we can present a powerful showcase of terrific regional wines of great diversity.\\" Some industry commentators lay the blame for this negative opinion on the giant, publicly listed multinational corporations, such as Constellation Wines and Foster's, which have dominated the industry for years and concentrated on the cheap commodity end of the market rather than building the reputation of Australia's finer, regionally distinctive wines. \\"While as family winemakers we all value our independence, we do share a common vision - that Australian wine can take on the world's best and win,\\" Purbrick said.

It was not decided under, but is relevant to, section 175 of the Companies Act 2006. Facts Bhullar Bros Ltd was owned by families of two brothers. Each side owned 50% of ordinary shares. The directors were Mr Mohan Bhullar, his son Tim, Mr Sohan Bhullar and his sons Inderjit and Jatinderjit. The company had a grocery store at 44 Springwood Street, Huddersfield. It also owned an investment property called Springbank Works, Leeds Road, which was leased to a bowling alley business called UK Superbowl Ltd. In 1998 the families began to fall out.nb it was clear that the families were continuing their feud into the court. As John Behrens QC noted in the High Court (25.3.2002) at [9], \\"9. I was not impressed with any members of either of the 2 families or Mr Khela as witnesses. I did not form the view that they were trying to assist me by telling me what they could remember. Rather I think that their evidence was tailored to what they conceived to be their best advantage. As there are a large number of disputed factual issues in the case it is right that I should briefly give the reasons that led me to form this unfavourable view. 1\\\\. The case as a whole is rife with dishonesty right from the commencement of the business in 1964 to the present day. Thus Mohan and Sohan were convicted of dishonesty in the early 1960s. Very substantial sums of money have passed through the Company and not been recorded in the Company's books. Indeed I was told that the whole purpose of the red book was to record payments not otherwise recorded. There can, in my view be no doubt that all members of the family were aware of the practice and went along with it. Included within this were the substantial loans to members of the family such as Mr Khela and Santokh. 2\\\\. In almost every dispute as to the facts the evidence is divided on family lines. If the witnesses had genuinely been telling me what they remembered one would have expected some divergence from this. 3\\\\. Mohan and Sohan are both elderly and were giving evidence through interpreters. Proper allowance has to be made for that. However I felt that they were both evasive as witnesses and often refused to answer a question directly or answered a different question from the one that they were asked. I was in particular satisfied that Mohan was not telling me the truth over the red book and the entries in relation to the repayment of Mr Khela's loan. 4\\\\. Inderjit was in the witness box for nearly 2 days. He was caught out in at least 2 lies in relation to PSL. He signed a letter to the solicitors for PSL stating that the ¬£20,000 had come from his own funds when it had not. The second lie was an attempt to obtain money by deception in the form of an increased dividend from Musefield's administrator. He plainly represented that BBL had paid out ¬£30,000 and ¬£2,500 in costs to PSL. He asked that BBL's proof of debt be increased by ¬£32,500 when he knew perfectly well that BBL had not paid a penny of the debt or costs. A sum of ¬£20,000 had been paid by Mr Majid and the costs met by Mr Khela. 5\\\\. Tim was in the witness box for more than a day. I thus had a good opportunity to assess him. Shortly after the litigation commenced Tim was prepared to install covert recording devices and to listen in to private conversations between Sohan and Inderjit and between the Group A shareholders and their lawyers for a period of over 6 months. Tim tended to answer questions put to him with short speeches designed to justify what happened. He did not answer questions directly. He was not caught out with lies in the same way as Inderjit but that does not mean that he impressed me any more. This is a case where almost nothing was committed to writing and thus there is less scope for such lies to be exposed. I felt he knew a lot more about the Santokh loan than he was having me believe. It was his case that for no apparent reason Inderjit told Mr Bones that the money had been repaid and gave him false invoice numbers to account for it. To my mind it is clear that the reason that a lie was told to Mr Bones was that the family wanted to keep the loan out of the books. Mr Bones spotted the payment in the bank account and thus some explanation had to be found. I think both Tim and Inderjit were fully aware that the loan had not been repaid and that Mr Bones had been told that it had. 6\\\\. Mr Khela had cost Sohan's family a huge amount of money. His evidence tallied with that of Inderjit in all material respects. His explanation for the repayment of the ¬£99,459.49 seemed to me to be wholly incredible. 7\\\\. I formed less of an adverse view of Jatinderjit than some of the other members of his family; but in the end I felt his evidence was tainted with the same family loyalty as affected the remainder of the evidence.\\" To wit, at [283]-[286] Tim was found to have been covertly listening to the other side's conversations with a bug, and this was held to be relevant to the amount he could recover, according to Re London School of Electronics Ltd Mohan and Tim told the board they wished for the company to buy no further investment properties. Negotiations began to split up the company, but they were unsuccessful. In 1999, Inderjit went bowling at the UK Superbowl Ltd alley. He noticed that the carpark next door (called White Hall Mill) was on sale.nb UK Superbowl Ltd was also leasing the carpark property, but was not the owner. He set up a company called Silvercrest Ltd (owned by him and Jatinderjit) and bought, but did not tell Bhullar Bros Ltd. But Mohan and Tim found out and brought an unfair prejudice claim (now s 994 Companies Act 2006) on the basis that Inderjit and Jatinderjit had breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty to the company. Judgment Jonathan Parker LJ held that there was a clear breach of the rule that directors must avoid a conflict of interest. Brooke LJ and Schiemann LJ concurred.

Early history The regiment was raised on 18 May 1849 by Lieutenant JC Johnston at Mianwali as part of the Transfrontier Brigade. In 1851, the brigade was expanded and redesignated as the Punjab Irregular Force, which later became famous as the Punjab Frontier Force or The Piffers. The Piffers consisted of five regiments of cavalry, eleven regiments of infantry and five batteries of artillery besides the Corps of Guides. Their mission was to maintain order on the Punjab Frontier; a task they performed with great aplomb. The 2nd Punjab Infantry took part in numerous frontier operations besides the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857-58, when took part in Siege of Delhi, the Siege and Capture of Lucknow, the Battle of Cawnpore, the Rohilkhand Campaign and the capture of Bareilly. During the Second Afghan War of 1878-80, the regiment fought in the Battle of Peiwar Kotal. In 1897, it took part in the Tirah Campaign. 56th Punjabi Rifles (Frontier Force) 220px Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was first changed to 56th Infantry (Frontier Force) and then in 1906, to 56th Punjabi Rifles (Frontier Force). In 1914, the regiment's class composition was two companies each of Dogras, Pathans, Sikhs, and Punjabi Muslims. During the First World War, the regiment served throughout with the 28th Indian Brigade. In 1915, it served in Egypt and Aden (Yemen), moving to Mesopotamia in December. Here, it fought with great gallantry in the bloody battles for the Relief of Kut al Amara on the Tigris Front in 1916-17, the capture of Baghdad and in operations north of Baghdad at Istabulat, Daur and Tikrit. In 1918, the regiment moved to Palestine and took part in the Battle of Megiddo, which led to the annihilation of the Turkish Army in Palestine. It returned to India in 1920.

She won the 2009 Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or Dramatic Special for Part I of the serial Little Dorrit. In her acceptance speech, she acknowledged her domestic partner, RT√â television presenter Anna Nolan. Walsh has won two Irish Film and Television Awards for directing in 2011 and 2018 respectively. In 2009, Irish Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Martin Cullen called her \\"one of our most accomplished directors\\". Career Walsh earned a degree from Dublin City University and has worked extensively in television, including children's programming. Her work on the BBC soap opera EastEnders included the murder trial of Little Mo Mitchell. In 2004, Walsh directed The Big Bow Wow for RT√â. The following year, she directed Funland for BBC Three, and in 2006, she directed the four-part RT√â drama series Hide and Seek. The first episode was described as \\"extremely stylish visually\\" by Liam Fay in The Sunday Times. At the end of the series, Fay commented that \\"the first three programmes were painfully slow\\" and \\"the closing installment seemed, at times, to grind to a halt,\\" noting that \\"much of it was filled with vast arctic silences as distraught characters stared meaningfully at each other.\\" Also in 2006, Walsh directed a short film called Match for the Dance on the Box project, designed to promote the topic of dance, for RT√â and the Arts Council. The film was awarded ‚Ç¨18,000 for being selected.

Dance on the Box. In 2007, Walsh directed BAFTA winner Danny Brocklehurst's ITV drama Talk to Me. The series, which featured scenes of a sexual nature between an adulterous teacher and her 15-year-old pupil, was defended by Walsh, who denied she had made them more raunchy on purpose. She commented, \\"I think the explicitness of the sex scenes and the sex scenes in general were challenging and intimidating for me as the director, as they were for the actors. They're not easy at all to do and they do all completely depend on trust. It may be explicit for nine o'clock ‚Äì but it's not so much about sex as about love. Its aim definitely wasn't to shock. It wasn't about testing the watershed at all\\". In 2010 she directed The Silence for BBC1, about a deaf girl who witnesses a murder. It stars Douglas Henshall and Gina McKee. She also directed Mo Mh√≥rchoir F√©in, a dance film with choreographer Fearghus √ì Conch√∫ir, that was part of RT√â's Dance on the Box series.

She directed Roald Dahl's Esio Trot, a television film adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel of the same name. Walsh has been nominated for the Irish Film and Television Awards four times.

The subsequent trial led to a miscarriage of justice when Michael Shirley, an 18-year-old Royal Navy sailor, was wrongly convicted of the crime and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1992 his case had been highlighted as one of 110 possible miscarriages of justice in a report presented to the Home Office by the National Association of Probation Officers and justice groups Liberty and Conviction. His conviction was eventually quashed in 2003 by the Court of Appeal after the DNA profile extracted from semen samples recovered from the victim's body was proven not to be his. Cook's murder took place shortly after six sexual assaults had been committed in the Buckland area of the city, and the killer was initially dubbed the Beast of Buckland by the news media. When police revealed that footprint evidence had been recovered and launched a search for matching shoes, the case became known as the \\"Cinderella murder\\". Because of the brutal nature of the murder and the preceding sex attacks, Hampshire police were under public pressure to quickly make an arrest. Shirley's later exoneration of the murder after serving 16 years of his sentence is significant as the first time that a UK court quashed a previous conviction on the basis of presentation of new DNA evidence. It was also the first occasion in which the Criminal Cases Review Commission supported an appeal on the basis of newly available DNA evidence. After serving the minimum tariff of 15 years, Shirley would have been released from prison had he confessed the killing to the parole board, but he refused to do so and said: \\"I would have died in prison rather than admit something I didn't do. I was prepared to stay in forever if necessary to prove my innocence.\\" The murder Linda Cook was a 24-year-old barmaid, living at the home of Linda Gray on Victoria Road North, Portsmouth.Paragraph 14 Cook had been in a relationship with Gray's son since August 1986 and had moved into the Gray family home at the beginning of November 1986.Paragraph 14 Gray's son had been remanded to a detention centre on 14 November 1986, but Cook had stayed on in the premises.Paragraph 14 Gray was able to account for Cook's whereabouts for most of 8 December 1986, and stated that at approximately 23:30 Cook went to visit a friend in Sultan Road, Portsmouth.Paragraph 14 Shortly after midnight on 9 December 1986 she left the friend's house to walk home. Some time between 00:30 and 01:00 she was attacked on an area of wasteland known as \\"Merry Row\\", adjacent to Lake Road.Paragraph 2 Her assailant raped and strangled her, stamping upon her several times and with such force that her jaw and spine were fractured, her larynx crushed, and imprints of his right athletic shoe were retained on her abdomen.Paragraph 2Paragraph 23 The attack took at least 15 minutes.Paragraph 4Paragraph 27 Her naked body was discovered later that day.Paragraph 2 A number of vaginal, anal, and vulval swabs were taken by the pathologist, and subsequent forensic examination confirmed the presence of semen, from which the blood type of the killer was determined.Paragraph 4 Trace evidence was also gathered, including fibres from beneath Cook's fingernails.Paragraph 21 It was noted that her fingernails \\"were long and unbroken, suggesting that she did not scratch her attacker, or at least did not do so with any ferocity.\\"Paragraph 21 Her underwear was found nearby, and subsequently tested negative for traces of semen.Paragraph 11Paragraph 12 This, combined with the knowledge of her whereabouts since 10:00 the previous morning, meant that \\"the semen found inside [her] vagina had been deposited there after her underwear had been removed and consequently was deposited by her attacker.\\"Paragraph 13 Michael Shirley Michael Shirley was an 18-year- old able seaman in the Royal Navy, serving aboard , which was docked in Portsmouth at the time of the murder.Paragraph 2 On the night of the murder he had been to \\"Joanna's\\" nightclub in Southsea, Portsmouth where he had met Deena Fogg, a local woman. When the club closed Fogg agreed to go to her home with him in a taxi. After a short journey of around 5 minutes, the taxi arrived at a residential tower block where Fogg said she needed to go to her mother's to collect her child, after which she would come back to the taxi.Paragraph 3 However, she had no intention of spending the night with Shirley and instead left the building by another exit and returned to her nearby home alone. After around 15 minutes Shirley realised he had been tricked, paid the taxi fare and set off on foot to see if he could find Fogg. At trial, the prosecution submitted that it was at this time that \\"he saw Miss Cook who was walking along Merry Row... and in his frustrated and angry state he attacked her, raped her and murdered her before going back to HMS Apollo.\\"Paragraph 3 Shirley stated that he had spent approximately 10 minutes looking for Fogg, then headed back to his ship. He said that he caught another taxi on Edinburgh Road at 01:23 which took him to the gates of the dock where he was booked-in back aboard ship at 01:45.Paragraph 27 Two days later he met Fogg again by chance, and during a brief conversation which Fogg later claimed she found \\"intimidating\\" the subject of the murder and their close proximity to the murder scene at the time was mentioned.Paragraph 39 He subsequently spent his Christmas shore leave at his parents' home in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. In January 1987 he returned to Portsmouth and was due to sail to the Falkland Islands. On 5 January 1987, before the ship left the UK, he made another visit to \\"Joanna's\\" where Fogg ‚Äì initially discovered as a witness during house-to-house inquiries ‚Äì identified him to a police detective as the man she had been with on the night of the murder. He was arrested and taken into custody.Paragraph 4 Charged with Linda Cook's murder, he was remanded in custody at Winchester Prison the same month. Prosecution case The prosecution case against Shirley consisted of four circumstantial \\"planks\\":Paragraph 4 *Athletic shoe ‚Äì The imprint of the athletic shoe found on Cook's body had been made by a size 43‚Äì45 right shoe, and had a distinctive tread pattern including the word \\"Flash\\" in the heel area. Shirley possessed a pair of size 44 athletic shoes with the same tread, and stated that he \\"may\\" have been wearing them on the night of the murder. At the time of his arrest they were at his parents' home, and were probably there when Linda was murdered. Between 1983 and 1986, 185,000 pairs were imported into the UK. In 1986 alone, up to 9,000 pairs of shoes with this tread were sold in the UK, of which 250 pairs had been sold in Portsmouth. Shirley stated that he had purchased them in Portsmouth around October 1986.Paragraph 23 No blood was found on Shirley's shoes when they were examined by forensic scientists.Paragraph 43 *Blood type ‚Äì The semen samples taken from Linda's body provided a match with Shirley's blood group, O positive, which is shared by 23.3% of the British adult male population.Paragraph 4 No blood matching Cook's was found on Shirley's clothing, and no matching fibres were found on Cook's or Shirley's clothing.Paragraph 43Paragraph 21 *Scratch marks ‚Äì At the time of his arrest, Shirley was examined and found to have healed scratches on his right cheek, right eyebrow, collar bone, left shoulder, right elbow, right forearm, right index finger, left upper arm, and left elbow, which the prosecution's expert claimed were about four weeks old, within the time frame of the murder. For the defence, a consultant forensic physician testified that it was not possible to date the injuries with such accuracy, and Shirley stated that some of them had been received while he was serving in Barbados in October 1986. However, examination of Cook's body had also shown that her long fingernails were unbroken, suggesting that she did not scratch her attacker, and no trace evidence was found beneath the nails to link her with Shirley.Paragraph 19‚Äì22 The jury were not told this. *\\"Missing half-hour\\" ‚Äì The prosecution case also relied on a \\"missing\\" 30 minutes, the discrepancy between Fogg's testimony that she believed they had caught the taxi from \\"Joanna's\\" at just after midnight, and she had arrived home at about 00:15, and Shirley's account of the timings. Taking into account Shirley's description of his journey back to HMS Apollo, they maintained that he should have arrived at 01:15, not 01:45. If he had arrived back on board at 01:45 this, they submitted, would leave 30 minutes unaccounted for, sufficient time to have carried out the murder.Paragraph 28‚Äì38 However, Fogg had given two statements to the police and in the first had said she left the nightclub with Shirley at around 00:30, placing Shirley well away from the scene when Cook was killed and corroborating his account of the evening. The jury were not told about the first statement, and it emerged later that the second statement had been \\"made under some duress; she had been in the police station for 10 hours, was concerned for her baby and her mother was standing outside calling for her.\\" The log book of the taxi driver who took them from the nightclub recorded that he had made a pre-booked pick up at 00:15 and did not arrive at the taxi rank where he collected Shirley and Fogg until 00.25. The log book was not produced at the trial. Additionally, the Crown alleged: *Alibi concoction ‚Äì During the brief discussion at their second meeting, Fogg claimed that she got the impression that Shirley was attempting to reinforce his later evidence that they had left the nightclub very late, which the prosecution described as \\"the beginning of an attempt to concoct an alibi.\\"Paragraph 39 When giving his statements to the police, he referred to Deena Fogg as \\"Sue\\", which she had, it later emerged, told him was her name. The prosecution claimed \\"that he was deliberately concealing his knowledge of the girl's identity in the hope that he would prevent the police from tracing her\\". This ignored the fact that he had nonetheless given \\"a full account to the police about his activities\\" with the girl.Paragraph 40Paragraph 42 Trial The trial began on 18 January 1988 at Winchester Crown Court before Mr Justice Hutchison. Shirley maintained his innocence throughout the trial, and as the case was based only on circumstantial evidence and the testimony of Deena Fogg, he and his legal team doubted that it would result in conviction. The prosecution produced no forensic evidence against Shirley. The jury believed the prosecution case, however, and on 28 January 1988 he was found guilty of the rape and murder of Linda Cook and sentenced to life imprisonment. The jury had retired at 10:08 \\"with strong hints that the judge wanted a verdict that day\\" and returned at 16:42 with an 11‚Äì1 verdict of guilty. An application for leave to appeal against the conviction was rejected on 4 May 1989. The judge who turned down the application, Sir David Croom-Johnson, maintained that there were \\"no lingering doubts\\" over the question of Shirley's guilt.Paragraph 5 Incarceration Shirley was incarcerated at several prisons during his sentence: *1988‚Äì1990: HM Prison Aylesbury *1990‚Äì1996: HM Prison Long Lartin *1996‚Äì1997: HM Prison Whitemoor *1997‚Äì2002: HM Prison Gartree *2002‚Äì2003: HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs Campaign to prove innocence Shirley protested his innocence, and in 1992 spent five weeks on hunger strike at HM Prison Long Lartin to draw public attention to his case. In September 1992 his solicitors sent the Home Office fresh evidence which they claimed pointed to his innocence. Frustrated that fresh evidence uncovered by a journalist was being ignored, Shirley also staged a rooftop protest ‚Äì of which he later said \\"Those couple of days on the roof were my only nights out in 16 years.\\" He only came down after prison authorities agreed to let in the journalist, Neil Humber, to talk to him. Humber was one of the earliest campaigners convinced of Shirley's innocence, and was the first to call attention to the differences between Fogg's two police statements, calling the time discrepancies \\"horrendous\\". On 28 January 1993 Shirley began another hunger strike and his mother told the news media that he would remain on hunger strike \\"until he gets something in black and white to show that there really is something happening. Hampshire are not going to own up to making a mistake. I would have preferred another force.\\" The hunger strike lasted 42 days until the Home Office \\"agreed 'possibly' to review the case if they were given new evidence in a coherent form.\\" Humber, who was due to attend a course, was told by his employers that he would be dismissed if he instead took the time off to write the report. He prepared a 49-page report which was passed to the authorities and was fired by his newspaper. With regard to the evidence, Hampshire Constabulary said \\"These matters have been passed to the Chief Constable of Hampshire and a further report will be submitted to the Home Office when these aspects have been inquired into.\\" Shirley's solicitor, Pal Sanghera, said he was \\"disturbed that the same force that had carried out the initial investigation and a further inquiry last summer was being given the task.\\" Shirley's campaign suffered numerous setbacks in persuading the authorities to re-examine fresh evidence. In 1995 he again applied to the Home Office for a review of his conviction but was informed by the Home Secretary Michael Howard that he \\"was not minded to refer his case to the Court of Appeal.\\" Throughout, Shirley was held in Category A prisons ‚Äì reserved only for prisoners \\"whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public, or the police or the security of the State, and for whom the aim must be to make escape impossible\\" ‚Äì because the authorities considered him to be \\"in denial\\" over his guilt. Shirley's lawyer, Anita Bromley, said \\"He is not in denial, he denies committing the crime. What Michael's case shows is how easy it is to be convicted of murder, and how very difficult it is to overturn that conviction.\\" The campaign was hampered by Hampshire Constabulary's poor handling of evidence after the trial: advances in DNA profiling would have demonstrated Shirley's innocence, and he \\"consistently asked that DNA tests be carried out\\" but the police claimed that none of the evidence or swabs had been retained, and that much of it had been destroyed 6 months after the trial.Paragraph 7 Eventually, in 2001, the police admitted that they had found a slide taken from one of the swabs \\"in a drawer\\", and in 2002 found further clothing evidence. Speaking in June 2002, James Plaskitt, the then MP for Warwick and Leamington, said: \\"This long delay has imposed an intolerable strain on Michael and his family... The system failed in the original trial, and it has been decidedly sluggish in helping him clear his name.\\" See also *Murder of Teresa de Simone *Murder of Wendy Sewell *Murder of Lesley Molseed *Innocent prisoner's dilemma *List of wrongful convictions in the United States Notes Appeal notes References Category:1986 in England Category:1986 murders in the United Kingdom Category:1980s in Hampshire Category:1980s trials Category:Crime in Portsmouth Category:December 1986 crimes Category:December 1986 events in the United Kingdom Category:Female murder victims Category:History of Portsmouth Category:Incidents of violence against women Category:Murder in Hampshire Category:Murder trials Category:Overturned convictions in England Category:Rape in Hampshire Category:Rape in the 1980s Category:Trials in England Category:Unsolved murders in England ","title":"Murder of Linda Cook"},{"id":"24419882","text":"The 129th Delaware General Assembly was a meeting of the legislative branch of the state government, consisting of the Delaware Senate and the Delaware House of Representatives.

Henry Montgomery Lawrence, President of the newly created governing body, the Board of Administration of the Punjab. They were irregular as they were outside the regulations of the Regular Army of the Line in such matters as discipline, training, uniforms etc. These 5 regiments were thus some of the first to adopt khaki uniforms, known as drab, so suitable for the local barren landscape. The purpose of these regiments was to form together the Transfrontier Brigade, to maintain the frontier between the newly annexed territory and Afghanistan, known as the Northwest Frontier, which was subject to frequent breach by marauding warlike groups of Afghan tribesmen.

On 24 November 1850. the regiment, under the command of Capt. Denniss, marched from Lahore to Kohat via Shahpur and Kalabagh, through the Shakardarrah Pass, escorting 6 lakhs of rupees, arriving at Kohat on 8 February 1851. Shortly after their arrival the regiment was inspected by Brigadier Hodgson,Probably J.S.Hodgson, who as a Captain in 1846 had raised the 1st Sikh Regt., of the Frontier Brigade commanding the Punjab Irregular Force.Regimental History, pp.1-2 Denniss relinquished his command on 31 March 1851, to rejoin the 1st European Bengal Fusiliers, passing command to Capt. G.W.G.Bristow(1/4/51-21/10/52), thence to Capt. T.P.Walsh(22/10/52-20/2/53), thence to Capt. Alfred Thomas Wilde(21/2/53-10/3/62), who forms a central role in the history of the regiment. Wilde Appointed to Command Major-General Sir Alfred Thomas Wilde, KCB, CSI, circa 1869 Lt. Alfred Thomas Wilde of the 19th Madras Infantry, whose name was given in 1903 to the regiment as part of its official title, was appointed second in command on 4 April 1851, and joined 4 days later, being appointed commandant on 19 November 1851.Regimental History, p.2 Service in Indian Mutiny In 1857 the regiment was sent into action by John Lawrence, younger brother of Henry and Chief Commissioner of Punjab, as vital relief reinforcements during the Indian Mutiny. Under the command of Wilde, it marched with the rest of the Transfrontier Force 1,000 miles in summer from Bannu on the NW Frontier to Delhi. After the Siege of Delhi had been lifted with their great assistance, they moved onto the Siege of Lucknow and took part in the Capture of Lucknow, when they captured the Sikandar Bagh with the 93rd Highlanders. John Lawrence was hailed as the \\"Saviour of India\\" for his decisive action in sending the Punjab regiments to assist at Delhi. The tribesmen in these regiments remained loyal to the British during the Mutiny, as they had no affection for the Indian Sepoy, against whom they had fought during the Sikh Wars.

Note skulls on ground, possibly positioned by photographer in this notorious image. Photo by Felice Beato Denniss wrote to his wife on 30 April 1858: > Are you not pleased to see by the papers the splendid conduct of the Gallant > 4th or the Denniss Ka Pultan at Delhie and Lucknow, poor old Wylde has been > severely wounded in leading almost every charge at the latter place.

Denniss had been at the storming of Delhi, being with General John Nicholson when the latter fell, but as an officer in the 1st European Bengal Fusiliers, of which regiment he later became Lt. Col.Chantler, P. (ed.) Sir Henry Lawrence, under whose orders Denniss had raised the regiment, had died from shell wounds on 4 July 1857 during the siege of Lucknow. Clearly his wishes for the recruitment criteria of the regiment differed from those actually used by Denniss. The word Pandy was widely used by the British as a synonym for an Indian Mutineer, after Mangal Pandey(executed 1857) one of the first Sepoys to rebel against a British Officer's command, now seen as a freedom-fighter by modern Indian historians. Punjab Irregular Force In 1851 the 5 original Punjab Infantry regiments of the Transfrontier Brigade became part of the newly formed Punjab Irregular Force, (PIF) whose members were known as Piffers. The Transfrontier Brigade appellation was dropped. A 6th regiment was added the same year, being the former Sind Camel Corps formed in 1843 at Karachi by Lt. Robert FitzGerald, by order of General Charles James Napier, conqueror of Sind. In 1865 the PIF became the \\"Punjab Frontier Force\\". Second Afghan War The 4th regiment was next in action in the Second Afghan War at the conclusion of which in 1882 its brother 3rd regiment of Punjab Infantry was disbanded, once again taking the number of regiments formerly in the Transfrontier Brigade to 5. The surviving regiments after 1882 were thus the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th. In 1894, it took part in a punitive expedition to Waziristan. In 1900, the Regiment was sent to China to help quell the Boxer Rebellion, and they were relieved in June 1902 by the 21st Punjab Infantry following the end of the rebellion. Renumbering as Rifle Regiment In 1903, the 5 regiments were renumbered 55 to 59 and afforded the crack status of \\"Rifle Regiments\\". Each was named after a notable early commanding officer. The 4th took the appellation \\"57th Wilde's Rifles (Frontier Force)\\" in honour of its gallant commanding officer at the siege of Delhi. World War I 320pxDuring the First World War, the regiment served on the Western Front in France and Belgium, where they fought in Battles of La Bass√©e, Messines, Givenchy, Neuve Chapelle, and the Second Battle of Ypres. Jemadar Mir Dast was attached to the 57th Wilde's Rifles when he performed the service for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross on 26 April 1915 at Ypres. From France, the regiment proceeded to German East Africa in 1916, and again distinguished itself in the long and difficult campaign. The regiment raised a second battalion in 1918, but it was disbanded soon afterwards. Between the Wars The regiment took part in the Third Afghan War of 1919. In 1921-22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. The 57th Wilde's Rifles (Frontier Force) was grouped with the 55th Coke's Rifles, 58th Vaughan's Rifles, 59th Royal Scinde Rifles, and the two battalions of 56th Punjabi Rifles (Frontier Force) to form the 13th Frontier Force Rifles. The 57th Wilde's Rifles became the 4th Battalion of the new regiment. World War II During the Second World War, the battalion took part in the British invasion of Iraq in May 1941. It then participated in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign against the Vichy French and fought in the Battle of Deir ez-Zor on 3 July 1941. In 1942, the battalion arrived in North Africa, where it fought in the Battle of Gazala. Transfer to Pakistan Army After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the Frontier Force Rifles was allotted to the Pakistani Army. In 1948, 4 FF Rifles fought in the Kashmir War against India. In 1956, the Frontier Force Rifles and the Pathan Regiment were merged with the Frontier Force Regiment, and 4 FF Rifles was redesignated as '9th Battalion (Wilde's) The Frontier Force Regiment' or 9 FF. During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, the battalion again distinguished itself in the Battle of Chawinda. The Frontier Force Regiment still maintains the lineage and battle honours of its predecessor regiments in the British Army, and retains the old PIF regimental badge of a stringed bugle, but with the addition of an Arabic Islamic character signifying \\"Here I Am\\", the standard response to the call of Allah. They still refer to themselves proudly as \\"Piffers\\" and are headquartered at Abbottabad, a city named after General James Abbott (1807‚Äì1896).Attiqur Rahman, Lt Gen M. (1980).

He led the party up the narrow path to the last rock until he was knocked down and stunned by a large stone thrown from above. On 16 November, the lieutenant displayed great courage in leading a party to the Crag Picquet when it had again fallen into enemy hands. He led the first charge, but was wounded in the action.

The base of the shell is somewhat bent. Its aperture is situated at the dorsum and is keyhole-shaped. This hole serves as an outlet for water and waste products. The shell has a slight reticulated sculpture with concentric cords crossed by radial ridges and with the alternate ridges larger. The color of the shell varies from creamy white to yellow white and is often slightly orange tinted. This species is mainly herbivorous and also feeds on detritus. The animal has a broad creeping foot and a developed mantle. Its carotenoid content has been investigated and the following substances have been found : Œ±-, Œ≤, Œ≥-carotene, zeaxanthin, diatoxanthin, mutatoxanthin and astaxanthin.

As close as 500 metres to the Caumasee, well known for swimming, is another dell, home of Lag Tuleritg which is just 18 metres higher. This lake falls completely dry in autumn and remains empty until being filled by a small river of just about half a mile in length (falling some 100 metres in level) that will start flowing around May depending on temperatures and snow melt rate in the mountains. Its origin is another lake, Lag Prau Pult√©, which is fed by underground water only in spring, disappearing in autumn and staying dry all winter. During a cold period in spring, water that entered the dell of this lake may disappear again as snow melt decreases and all water remains in the underground flow. Due to its origin the water of both lakes is grey all summer until the level starts to go down in autumn. In Lag Prau Pulte one can see another special effect caused by air being forced out of the underground, causing the lake not only to remain grey but offering frequent bubbles on the surface. Because its proximity it is very likely that the water from Lag Tuleritg continues underground to Caumasee, although no experiments using colour was ever to prove this.

Shunpei, the elderly shop owner, is proud of his career as a skillful hatter, with famous clients such as fleet admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. However, as time goes on, the number of orders decreases and his memory begins to fail him. Shunpei occasionally has to ask his security guard, Goro, to help him find his scissors. One day, Shunpei discovers that his childhood friend, Setsu, is Goro's mother. She left Goro due to an issue with her husband, and now she is in the end stages of cancer. Setsu had been physically weak since childhood, due to radiation exposure from the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945. Shunpei had thought of Setsu as a sister, but he couldn't ask her to live with him in Kure, so she left to earn a living in Hiroshima. He missed her ever since. Shunpei decides to reunite Goro with his mother. Shunpei knows that Setsu has been living in Tokyo, suffering discrimination as a radiation exposure victim. But when Shunpei finds Setsu, she seems to be living quite happily. Setsu still has a small sailor hat which Shunpei made for her years ago, and which always cheers her up in the face of hardship. Setsu showed the hat to Shunpei, to encourage him and renew his pride. Upon seeing the hat, Shunpei's mind is restored and his forgetfulness disappears.

Joseph Niego was one of the leading figures in the creation of the state of Israel. He was instrumental in the political, agricultural, and economical roots of the foundation of the Jewish State. Niego was sent to France to the Faculty of Agriculture in order to help Mikveh Israel cultivate the land. Thanks to different methodologies, including the Eucalyptus trees he imported to the Holy Land, he dried the swamps that prevented agricultural development. He then served for over 15 years as the General Manager of Mikveh Israel. In 1891, Baron Moritz de Hirsch founded the Jewish Colonization Association (JCA) in order to help the Russian Jews who were suffering from antisemitism. In 1896 Baron Hirsch appointed Niego as the advisor of JCA in Palestine. Aware of the unemployment and integration problem of the Russian Jewish immigrants, Joseph Niego decided to build economically viable \\"work-farms\\" which was a primitive form of a modern-day Kibbutz. In 1898, Joseph Niego introduced and arranged a meeting between Kaiser Wilhelm II and Theodor Herzl in Palestine, at Mikveh Israel. In 1911, Joseph Niego founded the B'nai B'rith Grand Lodge District XI that covered all Ottoman lands. The B'nai B'rith lodge in Israel is named after him in order to recognize and honor a life of service to the Jewish causes. In 1914, Niego founded the first Jewish High School in Turkey and became its first General Manager. In 1923, Joseph Niego was employed by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) as head of a fund that offered loans to the small and medium Jewish businesses. The impact of this association helped the Jewish community of Turkey to flourish economically. This system is seen by many people as one of the precursors of microfinance. In 1945, after more than five decades of service, Joseph Niego died at 82 years old.

The suburb is surrounded by the suburbs of Lansdowne, Rondebosch East, Athlone, Belthorn Estate, Rylands, and Belgravia. The main roads through the area are (north to south) Jan Smuts Drive (M17) and (east to west) Turf Hall Road (M24) linking to the M5. Thornton Road was for many years the main thoroughfare for this suburb and a hotbed for anti-apartheid activity in 1976 and 1985. Thornton Road is the location of the Trojan Horse Memorial in honour of those killed in 1985.During the apartheid era the upper section of Crawford was classified as a whites only area, Crawford is served by a railway station of the same name on the Cape Flats Line. Crawford is the home of City Park Stadium, home of the historic City and Suburban Rugby Football Union where a number of well-known Cape Flats rugby union teams played, including Universal Rugby Football Club, Progress, Perseverance and others. City Park also hosted the annual City Fair and for some time was the location for the annual Christmas Band competition. Baseball and softball were also played there during the summer months. More than thirty thousand people attended the funeral of Imam Abdullah Haron in Crawford. He had been arrested by the apartheid security police just after he had led the al-Jaami'a Masjid Milad al-Nabi celebrations on 12 Rabi al-Auwal 1389AH (28 May 1969); and was held under Section 6(1) of the Terrorism Act of 1967 until his death on Saturday, 27 September 1969. In November 1998 Nelson Mandela was a guest speaker at Crawford's College of Cape Town, formerly Hewat Teachers' Training College, a landmark on the apartheid struggle map.

The lido is 50 metres long and 18 metres wide, meeting Olympic standards. An ‚ÄúAqua Zone‚Äù for young children includes a refurbished flume. The co-located leisure centre has an indoor sports hall, fitness gym and fitness studio. There is a grassy area on which to relax, sunbathe or have a picnic.  History  Opened on 23 May 1939; ¬£7,900 was raised for building the pool, buildings and a complete layout. With its capacity of 356,000 gallons, the new 1939 pool, together with its surrounding complex, involved 23 contractors and sub contractors, using firms such as the London Brick Company and regional bodies such as Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire Power Company. In 1999, to mark the 60th birthday of the Banbury Open Air Pool, a record turnout of nearly 1500 people visited over the Bank Holiday weekend. The lido was closed from 2002 after various problems including failure of the pool's lining. In 2005 a campaign was developed to save the pool led by the Open Air Pool Support Group. After rumours of planned permanent closure, a 10,000 name petition was collected to save the pool and a demo of an estimated 300 people outside the key council meeting resulted in postponing a decision and re-opening a debate. A month later a well attended public meeting faced a panel of councillors and leisure officers. The leader declared that the pool would be closed. In 2008 Cherwell District Council agreed a contract for refurbishment costing ¬£1.4 million. Banbury Town Council contributes ¬£50,000 a year to help with the running costs. Parkwood Community Leisure, which operates other Leisure Centres on behalf of Cherwell District Council, manages the Woodgreen Leisure Centre. In 2009 the lido reopened.

CGIA., Hon. FRAeS, Hon. FAIAA., FlMechE., Flnst Pet., FRSA, CEng., MSAE, (22 March 1898 ‚Äì 12 May 1985) was a British engineer who was involved in the development of the internal combustion engine, as well as special fuels for the engine, and was one of the people responsible for the development of higher octane fuels. Early life Francis Rodwell Banks was born on 22 March 1898, son of Bernard Rodwell and Frances Emily Banks. He married Christine Constance Grant Langlands in 1925, the couple having two daughters. Banks entered the Royal Navy at the age of sixteen in 1914. After promotion, he commanded several coastal motor boats, his navy service ending in 1919 while on service in the Caspian Sea during the Russian Revolution. Interwar years Between the First World War and the subsequent world conflict, Banks was involved in the development of marine diesel engines, later leading to involvement as a consultant on the problems of various car, airship, and aircraft piston engines. In 1925 he became chief experimental engineer at Peter Hooker Limited, working to develop the 1500HP 178 litre ELS 'Stromboli' airship engine. Before long, having recognised the inadequacy of existing fuels, Banks began working on development of improved fuels. His work concentrated on increasing the octane rating, which allowed the use of higher compression ratios, in particular the fuel additive tetraethyllead. In 1928, he joined the Anglo-American Oil Company and by 1930, had joined Ethyl Gasoline Corporation (export division), which, in 1931, became the Ethyl Export Corporation. This work embraced the principal aero engine and automobile manufacturers in the U.K. and Europe, including the military air forces and commercial airlines. In addition the work covered motor racing fuels. His status was such that he was invited to develop the fuels used in the UK's Schneider Trophy entrants, his fuel blends contributing to the success of the British entries in 1929 and 1931. At this time, he was also involved in developing the fuels used by Henry Segrave and John Cobb in their land and water speed record attempts. He was also instrumental in solving the problems with the Fiat AS.6 engine, enabling the world records set by the Macchi M.C.72. In 1934 Banks presented a paper on ethyl to the Royal Aeronautical Society, for which he received the Taylor Gold Medal. World War II With the coming of war, Banks entered the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a junior officer, being sent to work at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;) at Boscombe Down. His previous work having attracted the attention of Lord Beaverbrook, Banks was accredited as a 'troubleshooter' and given special powers. Banks was later promoted to air commodore and was made successively, 'Director General of Engine Production' (DGofEP), and 'Director of Engine Research and Development' (DofER&D;), with the objective to plan the post-war future of the aero gas turbine for both military use and commercial applications. Post war In 1946 Banks rejoined the Ethyl Corporation (Associated Ethyl, at the time), also taking a number of directorships: loaned back as 'Principal Director of Engine Research and Development' at the Ministry of Supply in 1952, also in 1955 as a director of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, and after the merging of Bristol Aero Engines with Armstrong Siddeley, their overall 'Director of Sales' in 1959. With the later mergers within the British aircraft industry, Banks became involved with the Hawker Siddeley company, in 1963 becoming 'Assistant Managing Director' and 'Chief Executive (Civil Aircraft)' at Hatfield, the former home of the de Havilland Company. By 1969 he had become the President of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Retirement Banks retired at the age of 70, taking posts as consultants with a number of American aviation firms, with which he was still active at the age of 80. He died in 1985, at the age of 87.

The presidency armies, like the presidencies themselves, belonged to the East India Company until the Government of India Act 1858 (passed in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857) transferred all three presidencies to the direct authority of the British Crown. In 1903 all three presidency armies were merged into the British Indian Army. The unit was disbanded before Indian Independence. History They took part in the Battle of Seringapatam during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the Second Burmese War. First World War The regiment was stationed at Secunderabad in 1914 on the outbreak of war and was here until at least early 1916. They sent a wing of the regiment as a draft to the 63rd Palamcottah L. I. in 1914, which saw action in East Africa until December 1916, when it rejoined the regiment at Mandalay. Meanwhile, the other wing was sent to serve in the Persian Gulf from 21 September 1916, being split up in detachments between Jask, Chabahar, Bandar Abbas, Henjam, Kishm Island, Lingeh and Bahrain, all port towns on the Gulf of Oman relieving the 94th Infantry detachments previously stationed there until they were relieved by the 3rd Brahmins from 16 July 1917.

This situation lasted until February 1922. On 5 December 1921, Moplah prisoners in Cannamore gaol rioted. A breakout was attempted and in the ensuing struggle with the warders six internees were killed.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Carol Shields and stars Bruce Greenwood and Emilia Fox. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2003. It was released publicly on February 13, 2004. Plot The plot centers on a charismatic radio talk show host, Tom Avery (Bruce Greenwood), and his \\"mermaid researcher\\" girlfriend Fay (Emilia Fox). Tom has had a turbulent past with relationships and has had three divorces before the age of 40. Many of Tom's ex-wives turn out to be friends of Fay's. Fay has an overly high expectation of the men she dates; she expects perfection and wants to emulate her parents' rock-solid marriage. One day, it turns out that Fay's parents' marriage is not as perfect as it seemed and it breaks down suddenly, after 40 years of \\"wedded bliss.‚Äù Fay panics and feels insecure in her own relationship and forces Tom to go to great lengths to convince her that their relationship is different and that they are meant for each other.

Maeve *Connor Price ... Gary Woloschuc Production Development The film is based on the novel The Republic of Love by Carol Shields and the characters of Tom and Fay were created by her. The Republic of Love was conceived as a film adaptation in 1996, when Triptych Media producer, Anna Stratton read the book and was highly impressed with its humour and diversity of characters, and confessed to being a fan of Shields's writing. She said, ‚ÄúIt was the characters really that offered up a delicious cast for a film. I was also drawn in by the humour ‚Äìcharacters, situations and events that made me laugh out loud and the interweaving of the magical elements ‚Äì the mermaid myth and Tom‚Äôs middle of the night radio life ‚Äì with the love story. The story itself is classic ‚Äì rapture, rupture, reconciliation ‚Äì and love stories are one of the most popular filmic forms.\\" Canadian actor Bruce Greenwood Once Stratton had decided to produce the film, she looked to the United Kingdom to provide sufficient resources and for a co-producer, given the popularity of Shield's work in the UK. Stratton met British producer Julie Baines in 1998 in San Francisco in 1998 and discussed a collaboration with Baines's Dan Films company and Triptych Media. In the summer of 2000, Stratton approached director Deepa Mehta, who fell in love with the story and commented, \\"The book, a treatise on the nature of love, attracted me, as it is complex and yet accessible. It is really about different aspects of love ‚Äì mature love, familial love, sibling love and the nature of love and how elusive it is‚Äù. Mehta recommended Bruce Greenwood to play the role of Tom and subsequently attracted him to the role. Meanwhile, Stratton and Baines had remained in contact and met once again in early 2002 to discuss financing the project together and to find the female lead in Emilia Fox. Fox was immediately enticed by the character of Fay and said of the plot, ‚ÄúIt mixes the idealistic with the realistic which I thought was very clever, and there‚Äôs a strong balance, there‚Äôs something we can hold onto.‚Äù Producers Chris Auty, Bruce Duggan, Sarah Green, Bruce Greenwood, Mehernaz Lentin, Neil Peplow, Sarah Sulick and Claire Welland would later join the production team. Script and adaption According to Carol Shields, her basis for plot was that she loved stories that place lovers in isolation and wanted to \\" position my pair of lovers firmly in the midst of their community where the networks of family and friends form the real street maps.\\" Shields's perception of love is a mythical one, and she has said, \\" Love is, in the end, a magic and mythical force, inexplicable, indecipherable. Its arrival cannot be arranged nor its properties deconstructed. We can only marvel, as I hope the audience of this film will marvel, that, despite our fear and cynicism, it occasionally enters our lives and transforms us.\\" This mysticism is intended to be reflected in the occupations of the characters with Fay‚Äôs involvement with mermaids intended to accentuate her existence with a mythic quality while Tom's charisma over the air waves and his impact on other people's lives is intended to give a magical dimension. In adapting the script for the screen, Mehta mused over possible techniques that would capture the elusive nature of love on film and compared it to cooking an exotic dish where love is the main ingredient. In the end she collaborated with Esta Spalding to produce the final script for the film version of the book. Carol Shields was unable to write for the film adaption because of her declining health. She was never able to see the final result, as she died on July 16, 2003, but during pre- production she would occasionally visit, with her husband, to approve of design drawings and photographs of the cast and costumes to be employed. Filming The Republic of Love was shot on location in and around Toronto between November and December 2002. In selecting filming location, producer Anna Stratton felt it important to encapture the atmosphere of the novel by filming in a cold city during the winter. She was also influenced by the line that Tom says to Fay in the film, \\"geography is destiny\\" and believed the screen provided a rich visual opportunity to reflect this element of Shields's storytelling. The novel itself was set in Winnipeg but in filming in Toronto, Mehta attempted to recreate the \\"Republic\\" and to provide a paradigm where the characters‚Äô paths could criss cross and they would eventually meet each other. Frequent collaborators, production designer Sandra Kybartas, and cinematographer Douglas Koch were brought in to create the republic setting. They made many experimentations with the lighting style to reflect the contrast of mood in many scenes and to emphasise the strength of the love between the lead characters and their physical beauty, whilst maintaining a delicate balance. Mehta later cited that the film was the most difficult she had ever experienced, given the ongoing financial anxieties and a series of mishaps onset and filming delays which led her to believe that the film was jinxed. Reception The film was received a mixed reaction from critics. A number of critics noted that they were impressed with the performances of the main characters, and several indicated that they approved of the variety of emotions displayed by the actors, with critics such as Bruce Kirkland of The Toronto Sun remarking that, \\"It is a treasure that speaks directly to the idea of love as an ephemeral emotion in all its complexity.\\" He approved of the way the actors Bruce Greenwood and Emilia Fox interacted in their performances, saying, \\"Greenwood, in particular, resonates with a quiet dignity and slight desperation that signifies a man yearning for something that has eluded him for so long. He does this in the scenes with minimal dialogue, no mean feat. He has found his match in Emilia Fox, an unconventional beauty with a similar penchant for saying more with the fewest words. So, when they actually do talk, offering little glimpses into their tortured psyches, a seemingly insignificant conversation seems to take on a profound weight.\\" Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail concurred, noting the charisma of the cast and highlighting a believable magnetic charge between Greenwood and Fox. However, the film received a number of negative reviews. The film was awarded a 44% rating by the website Rotten Tomatoes. Brian Gibson of the Vue Weekly in Edmonton said of the film, \\"The tiresome zaniness and Seinfeldian conceits might be forgivable if the romantic plot weren‚Äôt so full of empty truisms and nonsense lines that would stump a Zen monk.\\" Film critic Christopher Null criticized the directing of Deepa Mehta, saying, \\"director Deepa Mehta does nothing to make this palatable. In fact, she goes out of her way to distance us from the story and the characters, most notably through washing the entire movie into total gray, giving it just a hint of color (in the end, the movie brightens up in a particularly awful scene that has animated flowers growing over the frame). Wintry symbolism has never felt so forced‚Äîand in a film that ought to have been played as a romantic comedy, it's never been more out of place, either.\\" References External links * Category:2003 films Category:Danish films Category:English-language films Category:Canadian films Category:British films Category:2003 romantic comedy films Category:Films directed by Deepa Mehta Category:Films based on American novels Category:2003 comedy films ","title":"The Republic of Love"},{"id":"24420405","text":"Mohammed ibn al-Talib al-Tawudi ibn Suda (1700‚Äì1795) was one of the most influential scholars of the 18th century in Morocco, both politically and intellectually.

In September 2009, several individuals fell under suspicion and were arrested due to fears that a suspected jihadist cell in New York was planning to explode bombs in the United States. According to a July 2010 indictment, the cell had members in London plotting to carry out a companion bombing in the United Kingdom.Feds NYC Subway Plotters Targeted London, TooFive charged as al Qaeda plotters in U.S. and U.K. CNN July 7, 2010Copy of July 2010 indictment Information gathered during the interrogation of one of the men triggered a nationwide bomb alert. Officials were told to be on alert for individuals with burns on their hands that might be chemical burns. They were told to be on alert for apartments with bad smells, or with multiple window fans. Participants Najibullah Zazi, his father Mohammed Wali Zazi (born 1955 in Afghanistan), and imam Ahmad Wais Afzali (born 1987) were arrested on 19 September 2009, for lying in a matter involving terrorism. All three men were long-time legal residents of the U.S., born in Afghanistan. According to the Chicago Tribune, American security officials suspected up to 12 individuals. The central figure in the United States wing of the group was 24-year-old Zazi, said by the FBI to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an Al Qaeda training camp in Pakistan in 2008. Zazi had initially said that trips he made to Pakistan in 2007 and 2008 were to visit his wife. His last trip lasted five months. Zazi acknowledged receiving weapons and explosives training in Pakistan's semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The FBI found images of hand-written notes on how to build bombs on Zazi's laptop. Zazi said he was unaware of these notes, and speculated that he might have downloaded them accidentally with a religious book he had downloaded in August. The FBI found Zazi's fingerprints on a scale and on batteries found in a house in Queens they raided after his visit. In 2009, Zazi was living in Colorado, and got a license to work as an airport shuttle driver. Previously he had lived in Queens, New York City, where he was eventually declared bankrupt. Zazi had been under surveillance for some time, prior to renting a car for a trip to New York on 9 September 2009. On 9 January 2010, two more men were arrested in connection to the bomb plot. Taxi driver Zarein Ahmedzay and Bosnian immigrant Adis Medunjanin were charged with making false statements to the police, and pleaded not guilty. Medunjanin was arrested after his car crashed on the Whitestone Bridge on 7 January in New York City.https://ottawacitizen.com/news/arrested+bomb+plot+probe/2424125/story.html The July indictment, noting Medunjanin called an operator and said \\"We love death\\", alleged that the crash was intentional and part of a suicide attack. Mohammed Zazi was charged on the counts of conspiracy to obstruct justice, as well as conspiring to dispose of his son's bomb-making materials and chemicals. Based on a request of the Denver Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), an arrest warrant for his arrest in violation of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß1001(a)(2) was issued on September 19, 2009. He was released on a $50,000 bail on February 18, 2009. He pleaded not guilty in February 2010. He was convicted in July 2011 of destroying evidence and lying to investigators. He was sentenced in February 2012 to four and a half years in prison. In October 2011, he pleaded guilty to instructing his lawyer to falsify immigration documents for his nephew. Afzali was arrested on September 19, 2009, on \\"charges of lying in a matter involving terrorism.\\", citing that during his September 11, 2009, conversation, he warned Zazi that the police had come asking questions about him, and then lied to the FBI about having done so in two subsequent interrogations. He also said that the call was being monitored. Afzali was represented by human rights lawyer Ron Kuby. He was released on secured bail of $1.5 million. On March 4, 2010, in a plea bargain Afzali pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of lying to U.S. federal agents, and said he was sorry. He faced up to six months in prison, and as part of the plea arrangement the government agreed not to request any jail time.Sulzberger, A.G., \\"Imam Snared in Terror Plot Admits He Lied to the F.B.I.\\", The New York Times, March 4, 2010, accessed March 5, 2010 Brooklyn federal judge Frederic Block sentenced Afzali on April 15, 2010. Afzali voluntarily left the U.S. on 5 July, within 90 days of his sentencing. As a felon and under the agreement of his plea deal, he is not allowed to return to the U.S. except by special permission.\\"Queens Imam Agrees To Plea Deal In Subway Bomb Plot\\", NY1 News, March 4, 2010, accessed March 4, 2010 Most of Afzali's family remains in the United States. According to his lawyer, Afzali's last words in the United States were \\"God Bless America\\". Afzali denied ever having intended to aid Zazi or deceive American authorities. Other persons of interest Another man who was questioned was Naiz Khan, who attended the same mosque as Najibullah Zazi when he lived in New York. A U-haul dealership in Queens had contacted authorities to tell them that it had recently declined to rent a van to three suspicious men whose credit cards had been declined and wanted to pay cash. Naiz Khan was questioned about the failed rental, but denied he had ever been to the U-haul dealership. Khan's apartment was one of those that had been searched because Zazi was believed to have stayed there. According to The New York Times, Zazi had shared an apartment with Khan, Amanullah Akbari, and three other men, when he lived in New York a year earlier. On 7 July 2010, five al Qaeda members were indicted in relation to the alleged plot. Abid Naseer and Tariq Ur Rehman were charged with involvement in a companion plot in the United Kingdom. Naseer was already in custody after his arrest for sending e-mails to an al-Qaeda operative in Pakistan that were reported to be at the heart of a plot to bomb targets in north-west England.Terror suspect Abid Naseer held on US warrant BBC July 7, 2010 On 3 January 2013, Abid Naseer was extradited from the UK to the US. On 4 March 2015, Naseer was found guilty by a Brooklyn court of plotting bomb attacks in the U.S. and of plotting to blow up the Manchester Arndale in the UK. Most of the evidence in his trial consisted of email exchanges between Naseer and an al-Qaeda handler who was directing plots to attack civilians in Manchester, New York City and Copenhagen. It was the first terrorist trial to include documents recovered during the 2009 Navy Seal raid against Osama bin Laden‚Äôs compound. Adnan Shukrijumah, reported to be charge of planning Al Qaeda attacks worldwide, was charged with plotting and recruiting members for the New York attack. Over four years later, in December 2014, Shukrijumah was killed in a Pakistani manhunt operation. In the wake of NSA worker Edward Snowden's surveillance disclosures, the U.S. government argued NSA spying helped foil the subway plot by tracking communications between Zazi and a bombmaker in Pakistan.

It was designated as the 51st Sikhs (Frontier Force) in 1903 and became 1st Battalion (Prince of Wales's Own Sikhs) 12th Frontier Force Regiment in 1922. In 1947, it was allocated to the Pakistan Army, where it continues to exist as 3 Battalion The Frontier Force Regiment.Condon, Brig WEH. (1962). The Frontier Force Regiment, Aldershot: Gale & Polden Ltd.North, REFG. (1934). The Punjab Frontier Force: A Brief Record of Their Services 1846‚Äì1924. DI Khan: Commercial Steam Press. Early history The regiment was raised on 10 December 1846 at Hoshiarpur as the 1st Regiment of Infantry The Frontier Brigade by Major JS Hodgson. It was composed of Sikhs, Punjabi Muslims, Pathans and Dogras, mostly recruited from the disbanded regiments of the Sikh Empire following the First Anglo-Sikh War. In 1847, it was designated 1st Regiment of Sikh Local Infantry, becoming the 1st Regiment of Sikh Infantry in 1857. In 1851, the regiment became part of the Punjab Irregular Force, which later became famous as the Punjab Frontier Force or The Piffers. The Piffers consisted of five regiments of cavalry, eleven regiments of infantry and five batteries of artillery besides the Corps of Guides. Their mission was to maintain order on the Punjab Frontier; a task they performed with great aplomb. The 1st Sikh Infantry took part in numerous frontier operations besides the Second Sikh War of 1848‚Äì49 and the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857‚Äì58, when it fought in Rohilkhand and Oudh in North India. During the Second Afghan War of 1878‚Äì80, the regiment took part in the capture of Ali Masjid and the advance to Jalalabad. In 1900, it went to China to suppress the Boxer Rebellion. 51st Sikhs (Frontier Force) 350px Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 51st Sikhs (Frontier Force). In 1914, the regiment's class composition was four companies of Sikhs, two of Pathans, and one each of Punjabi Muslims and Dogras. During First World War the regiment remained part of the 28th Indian Brigade. In 1915, it served in Egypt and Aden (Yemen), moving to Mesopotamia in December. Here, it fought with great gallantry in the bloody battles for the Relief of Kut al Amara on the Tigris Front in 1916‚Äì17, the capture of Baghdad and in operations north of Baghdad at Istabulat, Daur and Tikrit. In 1918, the regiment moved to Palestine and took part in the Battle of Megiddo, which led to the annihilation of Turkish Army in Palestine. It returned to India in 1920. For their excellent performance in the war, in which they suffered heavy losses and were awarded a large number of gallantry awards, the 51st Sikhs were made Prince of Wales's Own in 1921. Next year, the regiment raised an all-Pathan Territorial Battalion at Nowshera. The 1st (Territorial) Battalion 51st (The Prince of Wales' Own) Sikhs (Frontier Force) would eventually go on to become 11th Battalion The Frontier Force Regiment in 1956. Subsequent history After the First World War, the 51st Sikhs were grouped with the 52nd, 53rd and 54th Sikhs, and the two battalions of Guides Infantry to form the 12th Frontier Force Regiment in 1922. The 51st Sikhs became 1st Battalion (Prince of Wales's Own Sikhs) of the new regiment. During the Second World War, 1 FF saw active service in Iraq and Syria before moving in 1943 to Italy, where it again served with distinction. In 1947, the Frontier Force Regiment was allotted to Pakistan Army. In 1956, the Frontier Force Regiment, Frontier Force Rifles and the Pathan Regiment were merged into the Frontier Force Regiment, and 1 FF (Prince of Wales's Own) was redesignated as 3 FF. During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, the battalion fought in the Battle of Chawinda, while during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 it participated in the Battle of Chhamb in Kashmir.Attiqur Rahman, Lt Gen M.

In 1853, it was designated as the 6th Regiment of Punjab Infantry and became part of the Punjab Irregular Force, which later became famous as the Punjab Frontier Force or The Piffers. The Piffers consisted of five regiments of cavalry, eleven regiments of infantry and five batteries of artillery besides the Corps of Guides. Their mission was to maintain order on the Punjab Frontier; a task they performed with great aplomb. Over the next fifty years, the 6th Punjab Infantry took part in numerous frontier operations. It was also engaged in operations during the Indian Mutiny of 1857‚Äì58. 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force) Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force). In 1914, the regiment's class composition was three companies of Pathans, two companies each of Sikhs and Dogras, and one company of Punjabi Muslims. During the First World War, the regiment served with great gallantry on the Western Front in 1914‚Äì15, fighting in the Battles of Givenchy, Neuve Chapelle, Aubers Ridge, the Second Battle of Ypres and the Battle of Loos. Lieutenant William Bruce was awarded the Victoria Cross during the Battle of Givenchy. In 1916, the regiment arrived in Mesopotamia. Here, it fought in the bloody battles for the Relief of Kut al Amara on the Tigris Front in 1916‚Äì17, the capture of Baghdad, and in operations north of Baghdad at Daur and Tikrit. For its gallant conduct during the war, it was made a \\"Royal\\" battalion in 1921. Soldiers of the 59th Scinde Rifles formed part of the command of Brigadier General Reginald Dyer which fired into the crowd at the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. Subsequent history Havildar of 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force). Painting by William Luker Jr, 1918. After the First World War, the 59th Royal Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force) was grouped with the 55th, 57th, 58th, and the two battalions of 56th Punjabi Rifles (Frontier Force) to form the 13th Frontier Force Rifles in 1922. The 59th Royal Scinde Rifles became the 6th Battalion of the new regiment. During the Second World War, the battalion again greatly distinguished itself, serving in the Sudan, Eritrea, North Africa, Persia, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Italy. Sepoy Ali Haider was awarded the Victoria Cross during the Battle of the Senio, in Italy in 1945. In 1947, the Frontier Force Rifles was allotted to Pakistan Army. In 1948, 6 Royal FF Rifles fought in the Kashmir War against India. In 1956, the Frontier Force Rifles and the Pathan Regiment were merged with the Frontier Force Regiment, and 6th Royal Battalion The Frontier Force Rifles was redesignated as 1st Battalion The Frontier Force Regiment. During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, the battalion fought in the Battle of Khem Karan in the Kasur Sector.Attiqur Rahman, Lt Gen M. (1980).

Biography  Strausfeld was born in central New Jersey, one of a set of twin daughters of an ob-gyn and an urban planner. She studied art history and computer science at Brown University and received master's degrees in architecture from Harvard University and in media arts and sciences from the MIT Media Lab. In 1996, Lisa Strausfeld and two MIT classmates launched Perspecta, a software company in San Francisco that made visual user- interfaces for large databases. It was sold to Excite@Home in 1999. After the sale of the company, Strausfeld joined Quokka Sports, staying until the company folded in the early 2000s. In 2002, Strausfeld became a partner in the New York office of Pentagram, the distinguished international design consultancy. At Pentagram, Strausfeld and her team specialized in digital information projects, including the design of large-scale media installations, software prototypes and user interfaces, signage and websites for a broad range of civic, cultural and corporate clients. Strausfeld left Pentagram in 2011 to establish Major League Politics, and subsequently left MLP in 2012 to head up Bloomberg's data visualization efforts. Lisa Strausfeld has a daughter named Muriel, named for her mentor, Muriel Cooper.  Work  Her projects include the design of Sugar, the graphical user interface for One Laptop per Child; interactive media installations for the Museum of Arts and Design in New York and the Detroit Institute of Arts; large-scale media installations for the corporate headquarters of Bloomberg L.P., the expansion of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and New York's redeveloped Moynihan Station; web sites for Gallup, the architecture firms Ennead Architects and Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the arts group Creative Time, Brown University, Columbia Business School, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.); and information visualizations for The New York Times. In 2006, Strausfeld and James Nick Sears created \\"Rewiring the Spy\\" for The New York Times Magazine‚Äîan applet written in Processing that illustrated the connections between the names of suspected terrorists and terrorist events. In 2018, Strausfeld worked with Glowbox, a design studio in Portland, Oregon, to develop a virtual reality prototype that displays a three-dimensional timeline of women's history, based on The New Historia, a women's history project by Gina Luria Walker at The New School, where Strausfeld is a senior research fellow.  Awards  Lisa Strausfeld was honored for Interaction Design in the 2010 National Design Awards presented by Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum; she was a finalist for the award in 2009, the first year the discipline was recognized by the awards. She was named one of BusinessWeek‚Äôs ‚ÄúCutting Edge Designers‚Äù in 2007, and Sugar and the Times visualizations were both featured in the Museum of Modern Art exhibition \\"Design and the Elastic Mind\\" in 2008.

Birgit M√ºnchmeyer came from a Lower Saxony family of traders and private bankers. She is the daughter of merchant bankers who owned the bank M√ºnchmeyer & Co.. On 8 August 1959 she married the Hamburg merchant Ernst-J√ºrgen Breuel (born October 7, 1931 in Hamburg). Birgit Breuel studied political science at the Universities of Hamburg, Oxford and Geneva. In 1966, she entered into the CDU. From 1978 to 1986 she was Minister of Economy and Transport in Lower Saxony, then to 1990 was the Lower Saxony Finance Minister. In 1990, Breuel was elected to the Executive Board of the Treuhand - a holding firm responsible for the sale of East German state assets. A year later she became the successor of Detlev Karsten Rohwedder. While Rohwedder had been cautious about the sale of most state assets, favouring a worker-owned solution if possible, Breuel favoured quick privatization. She departed in 1995 from this office.

All three bear the symbols of orator status ‚Äì the fue (fly whisk made of organic sennit rope with a wooden handle). Safotulafai is a traditional village at the east end of Savai'i island with historical and political significance in Samoa's history. It is the traditional center of the island of Savaii, now became the center of Fa'asaleleaga political district. Safotulafai is the original 'Pule', which is why Savaii is called 'Pule' of Samoa. Years later, Safotulafai chose to divide the 'Pule' into six while reserving the right to be the 'Matua' of 'Pule'. Today, Safotulafai remains to be one of the traditional 'Pule' (customary authority) ruling districts of Savai'i. Chief (matai) council meetings are held at Fuifatu malae. Safotulafai is the village name with its sub-villages: Tuasivi, Fogapoa, Fatausi, Fuifatu, Fusi, and Eveeve. History In the early 1900s, during the time when the country was called German Samoa (1900 - 1914), this is also the place which saw the beginnings of the Mau, Samoa's independence movement., Lagaga: a short history of Western Samoa by Malama Meleisea and Penelope Schoeffel Meleisea,p.117 This initial resistance movement against German colonial rule was called the Mau a Pule. It was led by well known orator Namulauulu Lauaki Mamoe from Satotulafai., International Dictionary of Historic Places: Asia and Oceania by Trudy Ring, Robert M. Salkin, Paul E Schellinger, Sharon La Boda, p. 726 In 1909, Lauaki and other Mau a Pule supporters, including his younger brother who was also the holder of the 'Namulauulu' family chief title, bestowed by Namulauulu Lauaki at Falelatai, were trialed and exiled to Saipan by German Governor Wilhelm Solf. Some of the Mau a Pule died in exile., An Account of Samoan History up to 1918, Chapter V, A Record of Events in Samoa since 1822 by Te'o Tuvale By the late 1920s, the Mau movement had gathered widespread national support under the New Zealand administration which followed from colonial rule by Germany. In 1962, the country became the first Pacific nation to gain political independence, under its former name Western Samoa which formally changed to Samoa in 1997. Matai chief titles Safotulafai has strong traditional connections with Saleaula on the central north coast, through the paramount chiefly title (matai) of Letufuga. Safotulafai is always consulted by the village of Malie (Tuamasaga district) in conjunction with Manono Island (Aiga- i-le-Tai district), in the election of Malietoa title-holders.

The regiment later served in the Second Afghan War and World War I in the 5th (Mhow) Division. During World War I a second battalion was raised in 1917.\\"42nd Deoli Regiment\\", britishempire.co.uk Both battalions remained in India for internal security duties during the war but a single company of Meenas was posted to Mesopotamia.

The Kalydo platform launched commercially in 2008 and has been in service since. The Kalydo file streaming technology allows games to be played immediately, without the need of downloading and installation, providing faster and easier access to games. Games running on Kalydo do so via the proprietary Kalydo Player plugin and can run in a browser, or from the PC desktop. Many games that have been launched using Kalydo are subsequently serviced through social networks and game portals such as Facebook, Kongregate and Mini Clip. Kalydo made its service readily available to \\"developers of every size\\" on July 9, 2013 by introducing a low entry pricing structure and one-month try before you buy period. History The Kalydo platform launched in 2008, initially under a beta flag. Shortly after the service went commercially live. One of the first titles to launch on the Kalydo service was sports game OnGolf and HovoRun, the latter was cancelled by the game's publisher before going live. In years to follow an increasing number of titles launched on Kalydo including Godswar by IGG, Requiem by Gravity, Runes of Magic by Frogster and Formula Cartoon by Cartoon Network. Some game titles have since been discontinued by the publisher, while others remain active through Kalydo. Technology The proprietary Kalydo cloud gaming technology and service is available to developers and publishers worldwide. Kalydo is a collection of tools (SDK), plugin and online service to create, launch, maintain and monitor games throughout its entire life cycle. Kalydo offers a free trial period to developers, during which full access is granted to the tools, platform and customer service. Kalydo Player The Kalydo cloud gaming technology is based on file streaming, through a small proprietary plugin called the Kalydo Player (2.5 mb size) which is installed once on the end user's PC. The Kalydo Player handles various tasks such requesting data before and during play and authentication. When an end user plays a Kalydo powered game, the Kalydo Player requests and downloads the first game data needed to start playing. During play, remaining game content is downloaded dynamically. Using advanced methods of progressive downloading, data compression and prediction algorithms, Kalydo is able to provide a smooth game play experience. The data downloaded by the Kalydo Player is stored locally (cached)on the computers hard drive. This way the next time an end user plays the game, the same data does not have to be downloaded again. Games played through Kalydo are also added to the Windows Program Files list, where they can be un-installed like a regular application. File streaming Cloud gaming technologies are generally based on file streaming or pixel streaming. Kalydo's technology is based on file streaming which has a low bandwidth requirement to operate and is less sensitive to problems associated with pixel streaming such as lag and the need of a high speed internet connection. The cloud is used to provide a highly scalable infrastructure to stream the game content and handle big data processing. International availability Kalydo is available worldwide, including low bandwidth countries such as Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand. Kalydo's service is based on cloud gaming through file streaming, which makes it possible to operate on a low speed internet connection.
