She sailed with Troop Convoy 67 for France on 23 September. Upon arrival at the Azores on 1 October, she was detached and proceeded to Gibraltar on 19 October. Luce performed escort and patrol duty in the Mediterranean Sea for the duration of the war. On 26 November she departed for the Adriatic Sea and for five months patrolled the area in cooperation with the Food Commission. After voyaging to the eastern Mediterranean, Aegean, and Black Seas in May and June 1919, she returned to Gibraltar on 27 June en route to the United States. She arrived in New York on 10 July and proceeded to Boston for overhaul. On 29 October she was transferred to Reserve Squadron 1, Atlantic Fleet, and 18 March 1920 was reclassified Light Mine Layer (DM-4). In April she departed Boston for Newport, Rhode Island, where she operated with the destroyer force until July.

Set in the dystopian future, an employee for a conglomerate gets trapped inside the company's computer and ends up affecting the real world. Based on a 1976 John Varley short story, it was produced by Canada's RSL Productions in Toronto. Financing was provided by WNET. It premiered on the CBC in 1984 and later broadcast on American Playhouse in 1985. The film received positive reception from critics. Overdrawn at the Memory Bank was featured in the eighth-season finale episode of the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1997. Plot In a future dystopia, Aram Fingal (Ra√∫l Juli√°) is a lowly programmer working for Novicorp. Arts are prohibited, and he is caught watching the classic film Casablanca (\\"scrolling up cinemas\\") on his workstation. To rehabilitate him, the company transfers his mind (\\"doppels\\" him) into a wild baboon (a process which has become routine, with people buying \\"doppeling vacations\\"). For a few minutes, Juli√° narrates over footage of wild animals, and Fingal begins to enjoy his baboon existence until he finds his peaceful perch in a tree threatened by an elephant shaking it for fruit. He activates an escape clause that is supposed to return his mind to his original body. Unknown to Fingal, however, his body has been maliciously tagged for transfer (by a bored primary-school student touring the facility during its preparation for storage) to a separate wing for a sex change; and, with the computer unable to return him to his body, Fingal's mind must be kept active by storing it in Novicorp's central computer ‚Äì the HX254 (in graphic form, the HX368 in speech), which controls everything from finances to the weather ‚Äì until his body is located. His mind can only be maintained in such a way for a limited time before it is destroyed. Fingal's disappearance is reported to a rival corporation. The news is broadcast worldwide, causing Novicorp's share price to crash. Majority shareholders force Novicorp's Chairman (the film's main antagonist) to divert resources to keep Fingal alive and find his body. Apollonia James (Linda Griffiths), a computer controller, is assigned to locate Fingal and keep him from hacking into Novicorp's mainframe. With Apollonia's help, Fingal creates a virtual world where he encounters characters from Casablanca, including a version of Humphrey Bogart's character, Rick (played also by Raul Juli√°). While only minutes pass in the real world, days pass in the virtual one. Rick grows bored, and plots to bring down Novicorp's finances without being removed and killed. Apollonia tries to keep Fingal out of trouble, placing herself in opposition to Novicorp's leaders, especially when she finds herself falling in love with Fingal and develops a conflict of interest. With Apollonia's considerable help, Fingal eventually \\"interfaces\\" with the mainframe and defeats his antagonists. He also returns to his body, which has been discovered before undergoing the aforementioned sex change operation. Finally corporeal and reunited with his accomplice, Fingal has taken complete control of the HX368. After ordering bonuses and stocks for every employee, committing Novicorp's Chairman to a month of \\"compulsory rehab\\" via doppeling and changing both his and Apollonia's identity to those of Rick and Ilsa from Casablanca, Fingal vows to fight against the dystopian government. The film ends with the new couple walking out the door and, now free from Novicorp's oppression, talk about opening a club on the other side of town: Rick's Place.

It was shot between August 20 to September 12, 1983. Co-producer Robert Lantos said that the film's budget \\"exceeded well into seven figures\\". To alleviate the costs, it was pre-sold to small American cable companies. The film was shot on videotape, with Lantos claiming that if it was shot on photographic film, it would have been as expensive as Blade Runner. It was directed by Douglas Williams with the film treatment written by Corinne Jacker. It premiered on the CBC on September 22, 1984. It was later shown on PBSs anthology series American Playhouse on February 4, 1985. Reception Tom Brinkmoeller for The Cincinnati Enquirer called it a \\"tongue-in-cheek and imaginative 90-minute delight.\\" LA Weekly, acknowledging the low production value of the film, gave praise for its \\"quality\\" ideas and the strong romantic relationship between Julia and Griffiths' characters. The Washington Posts Sandy Rovner described the film as \\"certainly inoffensive, occasionally funny and altogether watchable.\\" Blockbuster Entertainment gave the film three stars. Mystery Science Theater 3000 Overdrawn at the Memory Bank was featured in the eighth-season finale episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K), a comedy television series in which the character Mike Nelson and his two robot friends Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo are forced to watch bad films as part of an ongoing scientific experiment. The episode was broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel on December 6, 1997. MST3K cast member Bill Corbett disliked the film, calling it an \\"extraordinarily dumb movie whose relentless 'funny' techno-futuro-jargon was the screenwriting equivalent of water torture.\\" Corbett also noted difficulties in mocking the film due to the death of Raul Julia, resulting in them barely making riffs on the actors. Paul Chaplin voiced his hatred towards Overdrawn, equating his distain with later \\"experiment\\" Hobgoblins. The episode was considered one of the best episodes in the series, both by critics and by fans of the show. Jim Vorel for Paste ranked it as the 40th best in the entire series, saying the film was ahead of its time and gave praise for the acting. Vogel however was irritated by its soft focus appearance but overall considered it to be one of the most interesting films featured on the show. A fan poll for the top 100 best episodes in the series voted it as eleventh. Elliott Kalan, the head writer for the Netflix era of the series, placed it as one of his favorite episodes in the series. In 2003, Rhino Entertainment released the MST3K episode as part of the \\"Volume 4\\" DVD collection, along with episodes focused on Girl in Gold Boots, Hamlet, and Space Mutiny.

(2013). Samurai Armies 1467‚Äì1649, p. 191. Early life and rise Letter from Uesugi Kenshin to Uesugi Kagekatsu. Kagekatsu was the son of Nagao Masakage, the head of the Ueda Nagao clan and husband of Uesugi Kenshin's elder sister, Aya-Gozen. After his father died, he was adopted by Kenshin. His childhood name was Unomatsu. In 1577, He participated in Battle of Tedorigawa. Upon Kenshin's death in 1578, Kagekatsu battled Kenshin's other adopted son Uesugi Kagetora for the inheritance, defeating him in the 1578 Siege of Otate. He forced Kagetora to commit seppuku, and became head of the Uesugi clan. Kagekatsu married Takeda Katsuyori's sister (Takeda Shingen's daughter) after the Siege of Otate. Conflict with Oda By 1579, Kagekatsu had gained the upper hand and forced Kagetora to commit suicide. This bloody division allowed Oda Nobunaga's generals (headed by Shibata Katsuie) to conquer the Uesugi's lands in Kaga, Noto, and Etchu. In 1582, Kagekatsu led an army into Etchu and was defeated by Oda forces at the Battle of Tenjinyama. He hastily returned to Echigo when he learned that Oda general Mori Nagayoshi had raided Echigo in his absence. When Oda laid Siege of Uozu castle in Etchu, in the course of which a number of important Uesugi retainers were killed, Kagekatsu's fortunes appeared bleak. Kagekatsu sent a letter to Satake Yoshishige, his allies. It's like a suicide note. :Please don't worry about us. :I was born in a good era. We will fight against over 60 provinces of Japan with only this Echigo province. :If we survive, I'll become an unmatched hero. Even if we are destroyed, my name will go down in history. Uozu castle fell on June 3, 1582, and Oda Nobunaga would die eighteen days later, in Kyoto. The Uesugi were given a reprieve with the death of Nobunaga shortly afterwards. Service under Hideyoshi Kagekatsu made friendly overtures to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and attacked Shibata Katsuie's northern outposts during the Shizugatake Campaign (1583) and went on to support Hideyoshi during the Komaki Campaign (1584), in which he played a limited role by launching a foray into Shinano. As a general under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Kagekatsu took part in the Odawara campaign 1590 and Korea campaigns 1592-1598, and rise to prominence to become a member of the Council of Five Elders. Originally holding a 550,000 koku fief in Echigo Province, Kagekatsu received the fief of Aizu, worth a huge 1.2 million koku when Hideyoshi redistributed holdings in 1598. After Hideyoshi's death, that year, Kagekatsu then allied himself with Ishida Mitsunari, against Tokugawa Ieyasu, as the result of some political dispute. Sekigahara Campaign The Sekigahara Campaign 1600 can be said to have begun, at least in part, with Kagekatsu, who was the first daimy≈ç to plan a revolt against the Tokugawa. He built a new castle in Aizu, attracting the attention of Ieyasu, who ordered him to Osaka, to explain his conduct, Kagekatsu refused, and Tokugawa began plans to lead a 50,000 man army north against him. Ishida and Uesugi hoped to occupy Tokugawa Ieyasu with this fighting in the north, distracting him from Ishida Mitsunari's attacks in and around Osaka. Anticipating this, Ieyasu remained in Osaka to engage Mitsunari; his generals Mogami Yoshiaki and Date Masamune would fight Kagekatsu in T≈çhoku (northern region Honsh≈´, Japan's main island). Kagekatsu had intended to move his force south, attacking the Tokugawa from the north-east while Ishida attacked from the west, but he was defeated very early in the campaign, at his castle in Siege of Shiroishi. Service under Tokugawa Declaring his allegiance to Tokugawa following his defeat in Sekigahara campaign, Kagekatsu became a tozama (outsider) daimy≈ç; he was given the Yonezawa han, worth 300,000 koku, in the T≈çhoku region. Kagekatsu fought for the Tokugawa shogunate against the Toyotomi clan in the Osaka Campaign 1614-1615.

The species is native to the eastern United States. It is the longest native snake species in the U.S. Description The eastern indigo snake has uniform blue-black dorsal and lateral scales, with some specimens having a reddish-orange to tan color on the throat, cheeks, and chin. This snake received its common name from the glossy iridescent ventral scales which can be seen as blackish-purple in bright light. This smooth-scaled snake is considered to be the longest native snake species in the United States. The longest recorded specimen measured in total length (including tail).

In specimens over , these snakes can weigh up to .Godwin, James C. Eastern Indigo Snake Fact Sheet. alaparc.org Although the indigo snake is similar in average body mass, extremely large specimens of the bulky, co-occurring venomous eastern diamondback rattlesnake can outweigh them. Taxonomy The eastern indigo snake was first described by John Edwards Holbrook in 1842. For many years the genus Drymarchon was considered monotypic with one species, Drymarchon corais, with 12 subspecies, until the early 1990s when Drymarchon corais couperi was elevated to full species status according to the Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles, in their official names list. Etymology The generic name, Drymarchon, roughly translates to \\"lord of the forest\\". It is composed of the Greek words drymos (ŒîœÅœÖŒºœåœÇ), meaning \\"forest\\", and archon (·ºÑœÅœáœâŒΩ), meaning \\"lord\\" or \\"ruler\\". The specific name is a latinization of the surname of American planter James Hamilton Couper (1794-1866).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Drymarchon couperi, p. 60). Couper brought Holbrook the type specimen from south of the Altamaha River in Wayne County, Georgia. Common names The eastern indigo snake has a number of common names including indigo, blue indigo snake, black snake, blue gopher snake, and blue bull snake. Distribution The eastern indigo snake ranges from extreme southwestern South Carolina south through Florida and west to southern Alabama and southeastern Mississippi. Their historic range extended into Louisiana.Hammerson GA (2007). Drymarchon corais couperi. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. A related species, the Texas indigo snake (Drymarchon melanurus erebennus), is found in southern Texas and Mexico. Conservation status Because of habitat loss, the eastern indigo snake is listed as a federally threatened species in Georgia and Florida.Grosse, Andrew M. (J.D. Willson, editor). Eastern Indigo Snake (Drymarchon couperi ) Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, University of Georgia. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources has listed the species as possibly extirpated within the state. The eastern indigo snake was largely eliminated from northern Florida due to habitat loss and fragmentation. A restoration program is currently underway at Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve (ABRP) in northern Florida. The eastern indigo snake was last observed at ABRP in 1982, until 2017 when 12 snakes were released as part of the program. 20 more snakes were released in 2018, and another 15 (10 female and 5 male) in 2019. The 10-year program is a collaborative effort between the Florida Wildlife Commission and private partners. Preferred habitat The eastern indigo snake frequents flatwoods, hammocks, dry glades, stream bottoms, cane fields, riparian thickets, and high ground with well-drained, sandy soils. In Georgia, the eastern indigo snake prefers excessively drained, deep sandy soils along major streams, as well as xeric sandridge habitats. Xeric slash pine plantations seem to be preferred over undisturbed longleaf pine habitats. Habitat selection varies seasonally. From December to April, eastern indigo snakes prefer sandhill habitats; from May to July the snakes shift from winter dens to summer territories; from August through November they are located more frequently in shady creek bottoms than during other seasons. The eastern indigo snake is most abundant in the sandhill plant communities of Florida and Georgia. These communities are primarily scrub oak-longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) with occasional live oak (Quercus virginiana), laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), Chapman's oak (Q. chapmanii ), and myrtle oak (Q. myrtifolia). Other communities include longleaf pine-turkey oak (Q. laevis), slash pine (Pinus elliottii )-scrub oak, pine flatwoods, and pine-mesic hardwoods. Cover requirements Because the cover requirements of eastern indigo snakes change seasonally, maintaining corridors that link the different habitats used is important. From the spring through fall snakes must be able to travel from sandhill communities and upland pine-hardwood communities to creek bottoms and agricultural fields. In winter, indigo snakes den in gopher tortoise burrows, which are usually found in open pine forests with dense herbaceous understories. Burrows need to be in areas where there is no flooding. Eastern indigo snakes heavily use debris piles left from site-preparation operations on tree plantations. These piles are often destroyed for cosmetic reasons but should be left intact because they provide important hiding cover for both the snake and its prey. Summer home ranges for the indigo snake can be as large as .Speake, Dan W.; McGlincy, Joe A.; Colvin, Thagard R.

Proceedings, Rare and Endangered Wildlife Symposium. Tech. Bull. WL4. Atlanta, Georgia: Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Game and Fish Division. Food habits and behavior The eastern indigo snake is carnivorous, like all snakes, and will eat any other small animal it can overpower. It has been known to kill its prey by beating it against nearby objects. Captive specimens are frequently fed dead prey to prevent injury to the snake from this violent method of subduing its prey. Chemosensory studies with mice (Mus musculus) have shown that D. couperi responds with significantly elevated rates of tongue flicking and investigation towards visual cues of prey, and not volatile chemical cues. Its diet has been known to include other snakes (ophiophagy), including venomous ones, as it is immune to the venom of the North American rattlesnakes. The eastern indigo snake eats turtles, lizards, frogs, toads, a variety of small birds and mammals, and eggs.Conant, Roger; Collins, Joseph T. (1991). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians: Eastern and Central North America, Third Edition. Peterson Field Guide Series No. 12. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. As defensive behavior the eastern indigo snake vertically flattens its neck, hisses, and vibrates its tail. If picked up, it seldom bites.Conant, Roger (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. + Plates 1-48. (Drymarchon corais couperi, pp. 186‚Äì187 + Plate 27 + Map 144). It often will cohabit with gopher tortoises in their burrows, although it will settle for armadillo holes, hollow logs, and debris piles when gopher tortoise burrows can't be found. Hunters, hoping to flush out rattlesnakes, often wind up accidentally killing indigo snakes when they illegally pour gasoline into the burrows of gopher tortoises (a practice referred to as \\"gassing\\"), even though the tortoises themselves are endangered and protected. Predators Humans represent the biggest threat to the eastern indigo snake. Highway fatalities, wanton killings, and overcollection for the pet trade adversely affect indigo snake populations. Snakes are taken illegally from the wild for the pet trade. Eastern indigo snakes are sometimes \\"gassed\\" in their burrows by rattlesnake hunters. Reproduction The eastern indigo snake is oviparous.Schmidt, Karl P.; Davis, D. Dwight (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (Drymarchon corais couperi, pp. 133‚Äì135, Figure 32 + Plate 14). The eggs are long by wide. Up to 13 eggs are laid. The hatchlings are long.Wright, Albert Hazen; Wright, Anna Allen (1957). Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Ithaca and London: Comstock Publishing Associates, a division of Cornell University Press. 1,105 pp. (in two volumes). (Drymarchon corais couperi, pp. 200‚Äì203, Figures 20 & 64, Map 21). =Captivity and care= Due to its generally docile nature and attractive appearance, some people find the eastern indigo snake to be a desirable pet, although its protected status can make owning one, depending on location, illegal without a permit. Only a few states require permits to own an eastern indigo snake, but a federal permit is required to buy one from out of state anywhere in the US. The permit costs $100; information about obtaining one can be found by doing a web search. Most states allow unrestricted in-state sales. To thrive in captivity, this snake requires a larger enclosure than most species do, preferably with something to climb on. One notable owner of a pet Eastern indigo snake was gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson during the time he wrote his Hell's Angels book. One evening, about 1966, he left his snake - with a mouse to eat - in a cardboard box in the Random House editor's office, but the mouse gnawed through the box and both animals escaped. The snake was subsequently beaten to death by the night watchman, which still caused Thompson great anguish several years later, and was his justification for sending his - often excessive - room service bills to Random House.Thompson, H.S.

The ship was launched on 4 July 1918, sponsored by Miss Anna Hamlin. The destroyer was commissioned on 23 September 1918, Lieutenant Commander John H. Newton in command. Maury, having completed a United State East Coast shakedown cruise, departed New York City on 12 November 1918 to escort a convoy bound for France. Detached off the Azores, she proceeded to Gibraltar, arriving on 26 November. She cruised in the western Mediterranean Sea until reporting for duty with the Adriatic Detachment at Venice on 18 February 1919. With that squadron for the next five months, she participated in their ‚Äúumpiring‚Äù duties as first Rear Admiral Albert Niblack and then Rear Admiral Adolphus Andrews sought to employ their influence in the political rivalry for the natural harbors of the Adriatic Sea. Primary contenders for this area, particularly Trieste, were Italy and the newly created state of Yugoslavia, itself fraught with internal nationalistic dissension. Secondary postwar problems connected with this duty involved clearing the Adriatic of the multitude of mines which broke away with winds and presented a menace to shipping; distribution of food to the hunger- stricken Balkans; and providing for the ever-growing numbers of refugees. Maury returned to New York on 25 July and three months later steamed to Philadelphia where she remained, undergoing overhaul, until 24 April 1920. On 17 July she was redesignated DM-5, light minelayer, and after another lengthy stay at Philadelphia reported to Mine Squadron I at Gloucester, Massachusetts, on 23 July 1921. For the next seven years she cruised the waters off the United States East Coast, deploying each winter to join in fleet problems which, with one exception, 1925, took her to the Caribbean Sea. In 1925 she sailed to the Pacific Ocean for a problem involving protective screening, seizing, and occupying of an unfortified anchorage in the vicinity of enemy territory and fueling at sea. After a winter deployment in waters off Cuba in 1929, Maury spent the summer in the Gulf of Mexico and in September returned to the United States East Coast. On 30 September 1929 she moored at Philadelphia, where she decommissioned on 19 March 1930. Struck from the Naval Register on 22 October 1930, she was sold 17 January 1931 to Boston Iron & Metal Company, Baltimore, Maryland, and was scrapped on 1 May 1934.

His reign's monumental architecture, numerous military campaigns and restoration of strong government have led historians to rank Suryavarman as one of the empire's greatest kings. Early years Suryavarman appears to have grown up in a provincial estate, at a time of weakening central control in the empire. An inscription lists his father as Ksitindraditya and his mother as Narendralakshmi. As a young prince, he maneuvered for power, contending he had a legitimate claim to the throne. ‚ÄúAt the end of his studies,‚Äù states an inscription, ‚Äúhe approved the desire of the royal dignity of his family.‚Äù He appears to have dealt with a rival claimant from the line of Harshavarman III, probably Nripatindravarman, which held sway in the south, then to have turned on the elderly and largely ineffectual king Dharanindravarman I, his great uncle. ‚ÄúLeaving on the field of combat the ocean of his armies, he delivered a terrible battle,‚Äù states an inscription. ‚ÄúBounding on the head of the elephant of the enemy king, he killed him, as Garuda on the edge of a mountain would kill a serpent.‚ÄùBriggs, \\"The Ancient Khmer Empire,\\" p. 187. Scholars have disagreed on whether this language refers to the death of the southern claimant or King Dharanindravarman. Suryavarman II also sent a mission to the Chola dynasty of south India and presented a precious stone to the Chola Emperor Kulothunga Chola I in 1114 CE.A History of India Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund: p.125 Suryavarman was enthroned in 1113 AD. An aged Brahmin sage named Divakarapandita oversaw the ceremonies, this being the third time the priest had officiated coronation. Inscriptions record that the new monarch studied sacred rituals, celebrated religious festivals and gave gifts to the priest such as palanquins, fans, crowns, buckets and rings. The priest embarked on a lengthy tour of temples in the empire, including the mountaintop Preah Vihear, which he provided with a golden statue of dancing Shiva.Higham, \\"The Civilization of Angkor,\\" p. 113. The king‚Äôs formal coronation took place in 1119 AD, with Divakarapandita again performing the rites. The first two syllables in the monarch's name are a Sanskrit language root meaning \\"sun\\". Varman is the traditional suffix of Pallava dynasty that is generally translated as \\"shield\\" or \\"protector\\", and was adopted by Khmer royal lineages. Life and reign During his decades in power, the king reunited the empire. Vassals paid him tribute. He staged large military operations in the east against the Chams, but these were largely unsuccessful. Inscriptions in the neighboring Indianized state Champa and accounts left by writers in ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, a Vietnamese precursor state, say that Suryavarman staged three major but unsuccessful attacks in Ngh·ªá An province and Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh province, sometimes with the support of Champa. In 1128 AD, he is said to have led 20,000 soldiers against Vietnam's L√Ω Dynasty, but they were defeated and chased out. The next year he sent a fleet of more than 700 vessels to attack its coast. In 1132 AD, combined Khmer and Cham forces again invaded, with a final attempt in 1138, to no real success. In 1133, L√Ω Grand Commandant D∆∞∆°ng Anh Nh·ªã led an expedition into Khmer territories, but his army later retreated due to unfamiliar climate and terrain.Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n, 1993. ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞, B·∫£n k·ª∑, volume 1 Later, the Cham king Jaya Indravarman III made peace with L√Ω court and refused to support further attacks. In 1145 AD, Suryavarman appears to have invaded Champa, defeated its king Jaya Indravarman III, and sacked the capital Vijaya.Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., On the Cham throne he placed a new king, Harideva, said to be the younger brother of the Khmer ruler's wife. In subsequent fighting, Cham forces recaptured the capital and killed Harideva.Briggs, \\"The Ancient Khmer Empire,\\" p. 192. A final expedition in 1150 ended in a disastrous withdrawal. Angkor Wat built by Suryavarman II In addition to war, Suryavarman practiced diplomacy, resuming formal relations with China in 1116 AD. A Chinese account of the 13th century says that the Khmer embassy had 14 members, who after reaching Chinese soil were given special court garments. ‚ÄúScarcely have we arrived to contemplate anear your glory than we are already filled with your benefits,‚Äù one of the ambassadors is quoted as telling the Chinese emperor. The embassy went home the following year. Another embassy visited in 1120 AD; in 1128 AD, the emperor conferred high dignities on the Khmer ruler, deeming him ‚Äúgreat vassal of the empire.‚Äù Problems concerning commerce between the two states were examined and regulated.Briggs, \\"The Ancient Khmer Empire,\\" p. 189. The king's reign saw great innovations in art and architecture. He presided over construction of Angkor Wat,Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., the largest temple ever built in the capital, and in many modern minds the ultimate masterpiece of Khmer architecture. Its five central towers evoke the peaks of Mount Meru, home of the Hindu gods. It was resplendent with more than 1,860 carved apsara, or heavenly nymphs, and hundreds of meters of elaborate bas reliefs depicting the Hindu legends and scenes from contemporary life. Other temples dating to his reign include Banteay Samre, Thommanon, Chau Say Tevoda, Wat Athvea and, east of the capital, the huge Beng Mealea complex. Suryavarman married, but no record exists of his wives' names. Suryavarman II was unusual among Khmer kings in making Vishnu rather than Shiva the focus of court religious life. The reasons for this decision are not known. Scholars have long debated whether his association with Vishnu helps explain why Angkor Wat faces west, the cardinal direction with which Vishnu is associated, rather than the common orientation for Khmer temples of east. Suryavarman II is the first Khmer king to be depicted in art. A bas relief in the south gallery of Angkor Wat shows him seated on an elaborate wooden dais whose legs and railings are carved to resemble naga snakes. On his head is a pointed diadem, and his ears have pendants. He wears anklets, armlets and bracelets. His right hand holds what seems to be a small dead snake‚Äîits meaning is unclear. His torso curves gracefully, his legs folded beneath him. The general image projected is one of serenity, and comfort with power and position. His image is part of a unique and detailed portrait of court life in the Angkor period. The scene's setting appears to be outside, amidst a forest. Kneeling attendants hold over His Majesty a profusion of fans, fly whisks and parasols that denoted rank. Princesses are carried in elaborately carved palanquins. Whiskered Brahman priests look on, some of them apparently preparing things for a ceremony. To the right of His Majesty, a courtier kneels, apparently presenting something. Advisers look on, kneeling, some with hands over hearts in a gesture of obeisance. To the right we see an elaborate procession, with retainers sounding conches, drums and a gong. An ark bearing the royal fire, symbol of power, is carried on shoulders. Further on in the gallery is a display of Suryavarman's military might. Commanders with armor and weapons stand atop fierce war elephants, with ranks of foot soldiers below, each holding a spear and shield. One of the commanders is the king himself, looking over his right shoulder, his chest covered with armour, a sharp weapon in his right hand. Death and succession Inscriptional evidence suggests that Suryavarman II died between 1145 AD and 1150 AD, possibly during a military campaign against Champa. He was succeeded by Dharanindravarman II, a cousin, son of the brother of the king‚Äôs mother. A period of weak rule and feuding began. Suryavarman was given the posthumous name Paramavishnuloka, He Who Has Entered the Heavenly World of Vishnu. Angkor Wat appears to have been completed only after his death.Higham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, A modern sculpture that adapts his court image in the Angkor Wat bas reliefs today greets visitors arriving at the Siem Reap airport. Parasols shelter this image of the king, as they did the real Suryavarman almost nine centuries ago. Notes References * Briggs, Lawrence Palmer. The Ancient Khmer Empire.

A remake of Warner Bros.' Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933), the film stars Vincent Price as a disfigured sculptor who repopulates his destroyed wax museum by murdering people and using their wax-coated corpses as displays. It premiered in New York on April 10, 1953, and had a general release on April 25. House of Wax was the first color 3-D feature film from a major American studio and premiered two days after the Columbia Pictures film Man in the Dark, the first major-studio black-and-white 3-D feature. It was the first 3-D movie with stereophonic sound to be presented in a regular theater. In 1971, it was widely re-released to theaters in 3-D with a full advertising campaign. Newly struck prints of the film in Chris Condon's single-strip StereoVision 3-D format were used. Another major re-release occurred during the 3-D boom of the early 1980s. In 2005, Warner Bros. released a new movie also called House of Wax, but its plot is very different from the two earlier movies, and the 2005 version received negative reviews from critics. In 2014, the movie was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Plot Professor Henry Jarrod is a talented wax figure sculptor with a wax museum in early 1900s New York City who specializes in historical figures such as John Wilkes Booth, Joan of Arc, and Marie Antoinette, which he considers his masterpiece. Jarrod is aware that his business partner, Matthew Burke, wants out of their partnership, especially since he refuses to add more sensational exhibits, giving a private tour to renowned art critic Sidney Wallace, who agrees to buy Burke out after returning from a Continental trip. But Burke refuses to wait that long and sets the museum on fire for the insurance money. Jarrod attempts to stop Burke and save his precious sculptures, only to be doused in kerosene and left for dead in the fire. Some time after getting the insurance money, Burke is murdered by a disfigured man in a cloak who stages the murder as an act of suicide. Burke's fianc√©e, Cathy Gray, is murdered by the cloaked figure weeks after Burke's body was stolen from the morgue, who is then caught in the act by Cathy's friend Sue Allen, who flees to the home of Scott Andrews. When Sue visits the police station the following day, she learns that Cathy's body was taken from the morgue. Wallace meets a wheelchair-bound Jarrod at that time, the sculptor having survived with his hands too damaged to sculpt. Jarrod explains his intention of building a new wax museum with his assistants, the deaf-mute Igor and Leon Averill, conceding to popular taste by including a chamber of horrors showcasing both historical crimes (beheading of Anne Boleyn, Charlotte Corday, Anne Askew, and Jean-Paul Marat) and recent events that include William Kemmler's execution and Burke's apparent suicide. Sue attends the opening of the wax museum and is troubled by the strong resemblance of the figure of Joan of Arc to Cathy. Jarrod claims that he used photographs of Cathy to make the sculpture. But Sue remains unconvinced while Jarrod hires Scott as an assistant, with Jarrod developing an interest in Sue over her resemblance to his Marie Antoinette sculpture, the police agreeing to investigate the museum while recognizing Averill from his criminal background. Sue arrives after hours to meet with Scott, whom Jarrod sent on an errand, and uncovers the horrifying truth that many of the figures are wax-coated corpses stolen from the morgue, including Burke and Cathy. Sue is confronted by Jarrod, revealed to have pretended to be bound to his wheelchair while wearing a wax mask to conceal his disfigured face and identity as the murderer. He subdues Sue with Igor's help and straps her to a table, preparing to coat her living body with wax. The police, having learned the whole truth from Averill, arrive at the museum and arrest Igor, who attempts to kill Scott before they storm into Jarrod's workshop. They manage to free Sue in time while Jarrod is killed in the struggle when knocked into the boiling vat of molten wax that he prepared for her.

Seeing promise in 3-D's future, Warner Bros. contracted Julian and Milton Gunzburg's Natural Vision 3-D system, the same one used for Bwana Devil, and filmed a remake of their thriller Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933), based on Charles S. Belden's three-act play The Wax Works. Among the significant changes: The earlier film was set in the year it was released (1933) whereas House of Wax was moved to circa 1902; the entire newspaper angle in the earlier film and the characters played by Glenda Farrell and Frank McHugh were eliminated; and although the masked figure was seen sparingly in Mystery, he is shown early and often in this remake. Among the foregrounded uses of 3-D in the film were scenes featuring a wax museum fire, can-can girls, and a paddleball-wielding pitchman. In what may be the film's cleverest and most startling 3-D effect, the shadowy figure of one of the characters seems to spring up out of the theater audience and run into the screen. Director Andre DeToth was blind in one eye and unable to experience stereo vision or 3-D effects. \\"It‚Äôs one of the great Hollywood stories,\\" Vincent Price recalled. \\"When they wanted a director for [a 3-D] film, they hired a man who couldn‚Äôt see 3-D at all! Andr√© de Toth was a very good director, but he really was the wrong director for 3-D. He‚Äôd go to the rushes and say 'Why is everybody so excited about this?' It didn‚Äôt mean anything to him. But he made a good picture, a good thriller. He was largely responsible for the success of the picture. The 3-D tricks just happenedthere weren‚Äôt a lot of them. Later on, they threw everything at everybody.\\"Steve Biodrowski \\"House of Wax (1953) ‚Äì A Retrospective\\", Cinefantastique website; accessed November 1, 2016. Some modern critics agree that DeToth's inability to see the depth is what makes the film superior because he was more concerned with telling a thrilling story and believable performances from the actors than simply tossing things at the camera. Release House of Wax was one of the big hits of 1953, topping the charts for 5 weeks and earning an estimated $5.5 million in rentals from the North American box office alone. To accompany its stereoscopic imagery, House of Wax was originally available with a stereophonic three-track magnetic soundtrack, although many theaters were not equipped to make use of it and defaulted to the standard monophonic optical soundtrack. Previously, films with stereo sound only were produced to be shown in specialty cinemas, such as the Toldi in Budapest and the Telecinema in London.Eddie Sammons, The World of 3-D Movies, Delphi, 1992 p 32R.M. Hayes, 3-D movies: a history and filmography of stereoscopic cinema, McFarland & Company, 1989 p 42 Only the monophonic soundtrack and a separate sound-effects-only track were said to have survived. As of 2013, no copy of the original three-channel stereo soundtrack is known to exist. A new stereo soundtrack has been synthesized from the available source material. The 3-D screenings of the film included an intermission, which was necessary to change the film's reels, because each projector of the theater's two projectors was dedicated to one of the stereoscopic images. Reception =Initial reception= Early reviews were mixed to negative. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times found the film \\"disappointing,\\" writing: \\"This picture, apart entirely from the fact that it is baldly, unbelievably antique in its melodramatic plot and style, shows little or no imagination in the use of stereoscopic images and nothing but loudness and confusion in the use of so-called stereoscopic sound. The impression we get is that its makers were simply and solely interested in getting a flashy sensation on the screen just as fast as they could.\\" Variety was considerably more excited, writing: \\"This picture will knock 'em for a ghoul. Warners' House of Wax is the post- midcentury Jazz Singer. What the freres and Al Jolson did to sound, the Warners have repeated in third dimension.\\" Harrison's Reports called the film \\"a first-class thriller of its kind,\\" and \\"the best 3-D picture yet made,\\" though it felt that \\"the added value of depth is not significant enough to warrant the annoyance of viewing the proceedings through the polaroid glasses, and that the picture would have been as much of a chiller if shown in the standard 2-D form, and probably even a greater thriller if shown on a wide screen.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that as a 3-D film it was \\"a smoother effort than its predecessors, obviously made with more care and less tiring to the eyes,\\" but that \\"[i]n all but technical respects, the film is a childish and inept piece of work.\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post wrote: \\"It's supposed to be a horror movie and it's horrible alright... The novelty has some appeal especially through its long shots into depths, but there is also a feeling of limitations once what novelty there passes. Then it is we go back to the gaga script devised by Crane Wilbur from a story which served one of the early talking films and one is inclined to shudderingly ask: Are we to go through all that again?\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker also hated the film, writing that he thought it had \\"set the movies back about forty-nine years. It could have set them back further if there had been anything earlier to set them back to,\\" concluding that \\"when Mr. Price started clumping around and choking ladies with knots that wouldn't pass muster at a Cub Scout meeting, I took off my glasses once and for all, put on my hat, and left.\\" =Later Reception= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 39 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads \\"House of Wax is a 3-D horror delight that combines the atmospheric eerieness of the wax museum with the always chilling presence of Vincent Price.\\" Impact House of Wax revitalized the film career of Vincent Price, who had been playing secondary character parts and occasional sympathetic leads since the late 1930s. After this high-profile role, Price was in high demand to play fiendish villains, mad scientists and assorted other deranged characters in genre films such as The Tingler, The Masque of the Red Death and The Abominable Dr. Phibes. Supporting player Carolyn Jones, whose career had begun when she appeared in House of Wax, gained a much higher profile more than a decade later in the TV comedy horror spoof The Addams Family as Morticia Addams.

As a teenager he worked as a bookkeeper. He briefly studied law and later became an accomplished court reporter. In 1945 he served as chief Allied court reporter for the \\"Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal\\", which judged the leaders of Nazi Germany. This was the first of the series commonly known as the Nuremberg Trials. Kapleau later covered the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, commonly known as the Tokyo War Crimes Trials. While in Japan he became intrigued by Zen Buddhism. During the tribunal he became acquainted with Karlfried Graf D√ºrckheim, then a prisoner at Sugamo Prison, who recommended that Kapleau attend informal lectures given by D.T. Suzuki in Kita-Kamakura.Albert Stunkard, \\"Philip Kapleau‚Äôs First Encounter with Zen\\", (Chapter 1) in Zen Teaching, Zen Practice: Philip Kapleau And The Three Pillars Of Zen, Weatherhill 2000, edited by Kenneth Kraft; . After returning to America, Kapleau renewed his acquaintance with D.T. Suzuki who had left Kita-Kamakura to lecture on Zen at Columbia University. But disaffected with a primarily intellectual treatment of Zen, he moved to Japan in 1953 to seek Zen's deeper truth. Zen training He trained initially with Soen Nakagawa, then rigorously with Daiun Harada at the temple Hosshin-ji. Later he became a disciple of Hakuun Yasutani, a dharma heir of Harada.Yasutani p. XXVI After 13 years' training, Kapleau was ordained by Yasutani in 1965 and given permission to teach. Kapleau ended his relationship with Yasutani formally in 1967 over disagreements about teaching and other personal issues.Ford p. 154 According to James Ishmael Ford, \\"Kapleau had completed about half of the Harada-Yasutani k≈çan curriculum, the koans in the Gateless Gate and the Blue Cliff Record.\\"Ford p. 155 In fact, Kapleau had not completed even a third of the koan curriculum. By his own admission, Kapleau had gone no farther than the Blue Cliff Record although Yamada Koun (who had worked on koans with Kapleau) claimed that Kapleau had not even finished half of that koan collection.https://www.shimanoarchive.com/PDFs/19860217_Kapleau_Yamada.pdf According to Andrew Rawlinson, \\"Kapleau has created his own Zen lineage.\\"Ford p. 156 Work and teaching During a book tour in 1965 he was invited to teach meditation at a gathering in Rochester, New York. In 1966 he left Japan to create the Rochester Zen Center. For almost 40 years, Kapleau taught at the Center and in many other settings around the world, and provided his own dharma transmission to several disciples. He also introduced many modifications to the Japanese Zen tradition, such as chanting the Heart Sutra in the local language, English in the U.S., or Polish at the Center he founded in Katowice. He often emphasized that Zen Buddhism adapted so readily to new cultures because it was not dependent upon a dogmatic external form. At the same time he recognized that it was not always easy to discern the form from the essence, and one had to be careful not to \\"throw the baby out with the bathwater.\\" He suffered from Parkinson‚Äôs Disease for several years. While his physical mobility was reduced, he enjoyed lively and trenchant interactions with a steady stream of visitors throughout his life. On May 6, 2004, he died peacefully in the backyard of the Rochester Zen Center, surrounded by many of his closest disciples and friends. Writings Kapleau transcribed other Zen teachers' talks, interviewed lay students and monks, and recorded the practical details of Zen Buddhist practice. His book, The Three Pillars of Zen, published in 1965, has been translated into 12 languages, and is still in print.Yasutani p. XXV It was one of the first English-language books to present Zen Buddhism not as philosophy, but as a pragmatic and salutary way of training and living. Michael Alan Singer, New York Times bestselling author and former CEO of WebMD, identified that the Three Pillars of Zen was the source which embarked him on his spiritual journey. Kapleau was an articulate and passionate writer. His emphasis in writing and teaching was that insight and enlightenment are available to anyone, not just austere and isolated Zen monks. Also well known for his views on vegetarianism, peace and compassion, he remains widely read, and is a notable influence on Zen Buddhism as it is practiced in the West. Today, his dharma heirs and former students teach at Zen centers around the world. Grist for the mill A favorite saying of Philip Kapleau was \\"Grist for the mill\\" which means that all of our troubles and trials can be useful or contain some profit to us. In this spirit, his gravestone is one of the millstones from Chapin Mill, the 135-acre (0.55 km2) Buddhist retreat center whose land was donated by a founding member of the Rochester Zen Center, Ralph Chapin.

He became a Conservative Member of Parliament after retiring from the navy. Early life Ryder was born in India in 1908 to Colonel Charles Henry Dudley Ryder, Surveyor General of India, and Ida Josephine Grigg. He was a great-grandson of the Right Reverend Henry Ryder, youngest son of Nathaniel Ryder, 1st Baron Harrowby. Ryder had two brothers; both were killed in the Second World War. Lisle Charles Dudley Ryder died in the Le Paradis massacre of 1940 in France.CWGC entry for Lisle Charles Dudley Ryder Ernle Terrick Dudley Ryder died in captivity after the defence of Singapore. Ryder was educated at Hazelhurst School and Cheltenham College before he entered the Royal Navy in 1926. Naval career Ryder served on several ships throughout his career. He served as a midshipman on the battleship from 1927 to 1929. As a lieutenant he served in the submarine as part of the 4th Flotilla in China from 1930 to 1933. Ryder also commanded several expeditions. This included captaining the ketch Tai-Mo-Shan on a 16,217 mile voyage from Hong Kong to Dartmouth, England during 1933‚Äì1934. From 1934 to 1937 he captained the schooner Penola during the British Graham Land Expedition in Antarctica. When the Second World War started, Ryder was serving as a lieutenant commander on . In 1940, he was promoted to commander of the Q-ship which was sunk by a torpedo in the Atlantic, 200 miles west of Ireland; Ryder was adrift for four days before rescue. Appointed commander of the sloop . In early 1941, he went on to captain the Prince Philippe a cross-channel steamer converted to a Commando ship, which sank after a collision in the Firth of Clyde. Ryder, now a commander, led the St Nazaire Raid, codenamed Operation Chariot, on 28 March 1942. This was a successful operation to destroy the \\"Normandie Dock\\" in the German naval base in the town. The stated aim of the operation was to deny large German ships, particularly the German battleship Tirpitz, a base on the Atlantic coast. For his actions during this operation he was one of five people awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for valour of the British Empire. =Victoria Cross= The official citation: His medal is held by the Imperial War Museum, London. =Later naval career= Ryder took part in the Allied attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe, Seine-Inf√©rieure on the Northern coast of France on 19 August 1942. The Dieppe Raid was largely a failure, but it helped influence planning for Operation Overlord, the landings on D-Day. Ryder achieved a final rank of captain in 1948 and later served as naval attach√© in Oslo. Later life Following his naval career, he stood for election to the Houses of Commons as the Conservative Party candidate for Merton and Morden at the 1950 general election. He was elected and served as the Member of Parliament for five years. He died on 29 June 1986, whilst on the yacht Watchdog during a sailing trip to France. He is buried in Headington Crematorium, Oxford.

Oregon Tech provides a total of 32 degree programs in engineering, health technologies, management, communication, psychology and applied sciences with a total of 37 majors. Almost all students complete externships, co-ops, or other hands-on training inside and outside the classroom.  History  Oregon Tech was founded as the Oregon Vocational School on July 14, 1947 to train and re-educate returning World War II veterans. Under the direction of Winston Purvine, the first classes were held in a deactivated Marine Corps hospital three miles northeast of Klamath Falls. The following year, the school's title was changed to the Oregon Technical Institute. In the first school year, 1947-1948, veterans constituted 98 percent of student enrollment. By 1950, the figure was 75 percent. In that year, in response to the Korean War, the school received a contract for training soldiers in welding and warehouse management. In 1953, Associate degree programs in Surveying and Structural Engineering Technologies were first accredited by the Engineers Council for Professional Development. In 1954, KTEC, the university's first radio station went on air. By 1953, associate degree programs in the Surveying and Structural Engineering Technologies were first accredited by the Engineers Council for Professional Development. Not long after in 1956, KOTI television opened on campus. However, KOTI is no longer operated on campus. In 1962, the institute was accredited by the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools. In 1970, the first bachelor's degree programs were accredited by ABET. It would be 25 years later when the first master's degrees were offered. 1975 The year gave way to the first Geo- Heat Center established. The campus was transferred to its current location in 1964, followed by another name change to the Oregon Institute of Technology in 1973. In 2012, the Oregon Institute of Technology officially rebranded to its current name \\"Oregon Tech\\". Oregon Tech's four locations in the Portland metropolitan area were consolidated into a single campus in Wilsonville in 2012 at InFocus' former headquarters. By 2015, the Oregon Institute of Technology became an independent public body governed by Board of Trustees.

It is preceded by the novel The Glove of Darth Vader and followed by the novel Zorba the Hutt's Revenge. Plot After an attempted assassination by the Empire trying to blow up Luke's X-wing fighter, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan tells Luke of the secret Lost City of the Jedi hidden beneath the rainforests of Yavin IV. Unknown to Luke at the time, the city is home to a twelve-year- old boy named Ken, who is called the \\"Jedi Prince.\\" In the city, with the vast databanks on the computers, Ken learns the history of the Jedi and the Rebellion from his only companions, his caretaker droids. As Luke is searching the forests he meets a mysterious healer, Baji. With Baji he searched the forests, eventually encountering Ken, who had run away from the droids. Before he is questioned further, his caretaker droid finds him and they both vanish in a puff of smoke from Dee-Jay. Luke, more determined to find this city, returned to get help from the rest of the Rebels. Meanwhile, Trioculus, the new Emperor has a meeting with Supreme Prophet Kadann. Kadann tells him that he is not the true son of Palpatine, but still gives him the blessing of the Prophets. He also tells him of the Lost City of the Jedi, where the Jedi Prince lives, saying that this prince could end Trioculus' reign. Able to infiltrate the Rebel's meeting with an explosive device, he demanded that they reveal to him the location of the city. When they refused, he readied the device's explosion, while still taking in the beauty of Princess Leia. As Luke stopped the explosion Trioculus started his second plan: to raze the forests in order to find the entrance. During this implementation, he suddenly goes blind and orders the capture of the healer, Baji. Baji tells him that when he uses the power of the Glove of Darth Vader he is injuring his nerve endings, causing blindness and his body to rot. Baji tells him of a cure, but it can only be found in his hut, which is about to be destroyed by the fires. Unable to stop his troops, Trioculus rushes into the hut, and saves the cure, but is badly burned and scarred. As the Rebels attempted to stop the troops, Luke finally found the City. With the help of the droids at the weather controlling center, he created a rainstorm which put an end to the fires. Ken decided to leave with Luke and join the Rebels in their fight leaving the City and his caretakers. Without finding the city, Trioculus left the planet, vowing to destroy all of the Rebels except Leia, who he would make his queen.

Maintaining retention in each of these fields often results in a positive outcome for the overall organization or school, or pharmacological study. In marketing, retention rate is used to count customers and track customer activity irrespective of the number of transactions (or dollar value of those transactions) made by each customer. \\"Retention rate is the ratio of the number of retained customers to the number at risk\\". In contractual situations, it makes sense to talk about the number of customers currently under contract and the percentage retained when the contract period runs out.\\" This term should not be confused with growth (decline) in customer counts. Retention refers only to existing customers in contractual situations. \\"In non-contractual situations (such as catalog sales), it makes less sense to talk about the current number of customers, but instead to count the number of customers of a specified recency.\\" In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 63 percent responded that they found the \\"retention rate\\" metric very useful.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. .

The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. Purpose The purpose of the \\"retention rate\\" metric in a marketing atmosphere is to monitor firm performance in attracting and retaining customers. \\"Only recently have most marketers worried about developing metrics that focus on individual customers. In order to begin to think about managing individual customer relationships, the firm must first be able to count its customers. Although consistency in counting customers is probably more important than formulating a precise definition, a definition is needed nonetheless. In particular, we think the definition of and the counting of customers will be different in contractual versus non-contractual situations.\\" In the workplace arena, the purpose of the retention rate is to assist organizations with deciding when to take action in order to keep employees happy and motivated. According to a survey by CNN Money, the top 100 best companies to work for had less than a 3% turnover rate during a 12-month period. Retention rate may also refer to colleges. According to the FAFSA, the retention rate is the percentage of a school‚Äôs first-time, first-year undergraduate students who continue at that school the next year. For example, a student who studies full-time in the fall semester and keeps on studying in the program in the next fall semester is counted in this rate. Construction \\"Retention applies to contractual situations in which customers are either retained or not. Customers either renew their magazine subscriptions or let them run out. Customers maintain a current account with a bank until they close it. Renters pay rent until they move out. These are examples of pure customer retention situations where customers are either retained or considered lost for good. In these situations, firms pay close attention to retention rates.\\" :Retention Rate: The ratio of the number of customers retained to the number at risk. Workplace Retention in the workplace refers to ‚Äúthe percentage of employees who were employed at the beginning of a period, and remain with the company at the end of the period‚Äù. For example, in January 2010, Company A had 500 employees. After one year, 200 of the 500 employees were still working for the company. The retention rate is 200/500 = 40%.

Perhaps the most recognizable species of this genus is the bluegill. Some Lepomis species can grow to a maximum overall length of , though most average around . They are widely distributed throughout the lakes and rivers of the United States and Canada, and several species have been transplanted and flourished around the world, even becoming pests. Trade in some Lepomis species is prohibited in Germany for this reason.Przybylski, Miros≈Çaw, and Grzegorz Ziƒôba. \\"Invasive Alien Species Fact Sheet.\\" NOBANIS ‚Äì Invasive Alien Species Fact Sheet.

Lepomis species are sometimes referred to as bream, but the term more properly refers to the unrelated European cypriniform fish of genus Abramis. The generic name Lepomis derives from the Greek ŒªŒµœÄŒØœÇ (scale) and œÄ·ø∂ŒºŒ± (cover, plug, operculum). Phylogeny Phylogeny of all Lepomis species based on a partitioned mixed-model Bayesian analysis of a seven gene dataset of mitochondrial and nuclear gene DNA sequences by Near et al. (2005), expanded with fossil species. Subgenera in bold follow Bailey (1938): *) L. peltastes was not originally included in the analysis by Near et al. (2005) and is included here based on commonly accepted sister relationship to L. megalotis. ) See section 'Evolutionary History' below for explanation. *) Phylogenetic position in clade II uncertain. See section 'Fossil record' for clarification. Evolutionary history Phylogenetic reconstructions using a combination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences calibrated with fossils to estimate ages of divergences suggests that the genus Lepomis diverged from the black bass in genus Micropterus, its sister taxon, about 25 million years ago. The deepest split among currently living species of Lepomis is dated to ~15 million years ago and separates genus Lepomis into two clades: clade I that leads to the modern bluegill, orange-spotted, green, and warmouth sunfish, and a clade II that includes the modern long-ear, red-breasted, pumpkinseed, redear, and red-spotted sunfish (see section 'Phylogeny' above). The timing of this speciation event roughly corresponds with the Middle Miocene disruption that resulted in increased aridity on the plains of North America and a transition from savannah to grasslands, although the relevance of these environmental changes to the evolution of Lepomis is unclear. Fossil record No fossils unambiguously assigned to genus Lepomis are currently known from the putative stem-lineage that must have existed between 25-15 million years ago, spanning most of the early Miocene. Currently, four extinct species of Lepomis are known from the fossil record: There are at least two as yet undescribed fossil species of Lepomis that reach back to the middle Miocene: * Lepomis sp. A consists of fragmentary fossils of its lower jaw from Nebraska, dated to 13.5 million years ago, and shows morphological similarities to the modern Lepomis microlophus, although its great age means that this species predates the divergence of any of the living species. * Lepomis sp. B was found in deposits in Kansas, dated to 12 million years ago. fossil of Lepomis kansasensis Two other more recent fossil species appear to be closely allied to Lepomis gulosus, and indeed their earliest occurrence may be close to the divergence of the lineage leading to the modern warmouth from other species of Lepomis: * Lepomis kansasensis lived 6.6 million years ago, and had pterygoid teeth, indicating a close relationship to the warmouth. * Lepomis serratus is known from 3.4 to 2.0 million year old deposits in Nebraska, and also appears to be closely related to or ancestral to the warmouth on the basis of its preopercle. Species There are currently 13 recognized species in this genus: L. miniatus * Lepomis auritus (Linnaeus, 1758) (redbreast sunfish) * Lepomis cyanellus (Rafinesque, 1819) (green sunfish) * Lepomis gibbosus (Linnaeus, 1758) (pumpkinseed) * Lepomis gulosus (G.

Stratford is north, Kaponga 13 km west, and HƒÅwera is south. State Highway 3 runs through the town... Eltham is South Taranaki's second largest town. The population was 1941 in the 2013 Census, a decrease of 42 from 2006. Eltham is known as the cradle of the Taranaki dairy industry (the co-operative system in particular), and for being the one place in New Zealand that manufactured rennet which is important in cheesemaking.See It was also the first place to export butter to England. History European settlement began in Eltham in the 1870s, with blocks of densely forested land being taken up mainly to the north of Mountain Road. A profusion of sawmilling companies cleared the district which, when grassed, proved ideal for dairy farming.See In 1884, the year Eltham was declared a town district, settlers, mainly from England, arrived there and the town had a population of 25. Eltham was declared a borough in 1901, and became part of South Taranaki District with the local body amalgamations of 1989. High Street (which runs through the centre of town - as part of State Highway 3 connecting Stratford, Ngaere, Normanby and HƒÅwera) and Bridge Street (which heads westward towards Kaponga and joins State Highway 45 near Opunake), were the first tar-sealed roads in New Zealand. Industry The town's main industry is cheese production, with much of Mainland Cheese's speciality range such as feta and camembert being produced in the Bridge Street factory. Other cheese products such as the processed cheese used in many burgers are produced at the company's Collingwood Street site, formerly occupied by the Taranaki Co-operative Dairy Company's milk powder plant, but now extensively remodelled.The Taranaki co- operative was formed in 1965 when the Cardiff, Eltham, Normanby, and Stratford dairy co-operatives were merged. The Eltham plant was opened for the 1965-66 season. Some of the records of this company (from 1950-1983) are held at the , and a summary of that holding may be seen at Cheese has been used as a central symbol of the town, and to reinforce this view, the town's water supply tank was painted to represent a large block of cheese in 2002. Eltham's other significant industry is the ANZCO ( formerly Riverlands) freezing works, which has a satellite plant in Bulls, in Manawatu. Both plants can process up to 1250 head of cattle daily.

The Mangawharawhara Stream runs to the east of the Main Trunk railway line, flows under the central business district via a culvert, and on past Eltham School and the Eltham Golf Club to the south of the town. The Waingongoro River forms a western boundary to the town itself, flowing through the Presbyterian Church campsite (in the town's northwest) and Taumata Park (the town's main camping area and sports ground - in the western part of the town) and winding itself southwestward to meet the Tasman Sea at Ohawe Beach, near HƒÅwera. Roth notes that it was on the banks of this river that Chew Chong set up his \\"Jubilee\\" factory in 1887.

He attended school until the tenth grade and on July 20, 1951, he married Barbara Regan. In 1952, he joined the Prohibition Party after attending a rally hosted by future Prohibition vice-presidential nominee Mark R. Shaw. Career =Politics= From 1953 to 1956, he served as the executive secretary of the Massachusetts Prohibition Party and ran for Massachusetts Secretary of State in 1956.

Dodge, ran for Secretary of State, and Calvin's wife, Elsi, ran for the regent of Colorado University. =Presidential= During the 1976 and 1980 presidential elections he was given the vice-presidential nomination of the Prohibition Party. On June 24, 1983, forty five delegates voted to give Dodge the presidential nomination in Mandan, North Dakota, for the 1984 presidential election and on January 3, 1984, he suffered a heart attack, but recovered. He appeared on the ballots in North Dakota, New Mexico, Kansas, Arkansas, and Colorado and as a write-in candidate in Ohio and received 4,236 votes. During the 1988 presidential election he was given the party's presidential nomination again and appeared on the ballot in Arkansas, Tennessee, New Mexico, and Colorado and received 8,002 votes.

During Earl Higgerson's ten years as treasurer Dodge refused to allow him to see the party's account books, donor lists, sign checks, or know of actions taken by Dodge on his account. In 1999, he sold the party's headquarters for $119,500 saying that he would use the money to build one on his property, but was alleged to have kept the money for himself and moved the party's headquarters to a tool shed. In 2003, members of the party opposed to him met at a condo in Tennessee and promoted him to chairman emeritus, as a polite way of firing him according to James Hedges. During the 2004 presidential election their faction nominated Gene Amondson under the Concerns of People ballot line while eight delegates from his faction of the party gave him its presidential nomination at his home in Lakewood, Colorado. In the general election he appeared on the ballot in Colorado and received 140 votes while Amondson received 1,944 votes from Colorado and Louisiana.

The sheaf toss is a traditional Scottish agricultural sport event originally contested at country fairs. A pitchfork is used to hurl a burlap bag stuffed with straw over a horizontal bar above the competitor's head. Typical weight for the bag is 16 pounds (about 7 kg). Three chances are given to each competitor to cleanly go over the bar, without touching it. After all challengers have made their attempts, the bar is raised and all successful competitors move on to the new height. This continues until all but one athlete is eliminated. The Sheaf toss has been incorporated as an event at many of the Scottish highland games although technically it is not itself a heavy athletics event. The sheaf toss is also a traditional sport in the Basque Country. It is a feature of the annual Sykehouse Show in South Yorkshire, England. Sheaf tossing is also contested in Ireland and Australia particularly at agricultural shows and at fairs; Irish sheaf tossing differs from sheaf tossing in Scotland and France in that the sheaf is made of rushes which are bound tightly with baling twine and are not placed in a bag. The rules are the same as the Scottish version and a pitchfork is used. The same pitchfork is usually used for all competitors so as not to give anybody an unfair advantage by allowing them use their own customised pitchfork. A variation of this rule is that if one brings a custom pitchfork to the competition, they must allow any other competitor to use that fork.

His direct ancestor was Domingo Antonio Jos√© Pi√±ero Pineda from Hermigua, La Gomera arriving in Puerto Rico around 1816.Jesus T. Pi√±ero Biography He obtained his primary and secondary education in his hometown. In 1914, he attended the College of Liberal Arts of the University of Puerto Rico. He also attended the School of Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, Library of Congress Political career Between 1920 and 1944, Pi√±ero's interest in agriculture kept him engaged in the dairy business and in the cultivation of sugar cane. His interest in the agricultural development of Puerto Rico led him to participate in politics, particularly those concerning the issues of the cultivation of sugar cane and development of the industry. Between 1928 and 1932, a period during which Puerto Rico's internal government was still run by continental Americans appointed by the President of the United States, Pi√±ero was president of the Assembly of the Municipality of Carolina. Between 1934 and 1937, he was the president of the Association of the Sugar Cane Industry and was elected to the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico. In 1938, Pi√±ero was one of the founders, along with Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, of the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD). In the elections of 1940, he was elected to the House of Representatives. In 1944 he was elected as Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, and represented the island in the United States House of Representatives in Washington, D.C.. His position did not have voting powers in Congress. First Puerto Rican governor appointed by the U.S. Pi√±ero (on right) with Truman In 1946, President Harry S. Truman relieved Governor Rexford Guy Tugwell, who had served in this position from 1941, and named Pi√±ero as governor in his place, the first native Puerto Rican appointed to that post under U.S. administration. On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, controlled by the PPD and presided by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, approved the bill that day.\\"La obra jur√≠dica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008); by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintr√≥n This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law) when Governor Pi√±ero signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it would be a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, the only non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.La Gobernaci√≥n de Jes√∫s T.

Criticism Concerns exist around the amount of influence Pearson, being a commercial company, has on public education. Other concerns are around tax avoidance, high value contracts, and in one instance, laying off teachers to offset the high costs of testing. In 2017, more than six out of ten Pearson's shareholders voted against the chief executive's pay package of ¬£1.5m after the company made a record loss. Pearson US has been criticised for using offshore tax avoidance schemes involving a host of companies at a service address in Luxembourg. In the United Kingdom, Pearson owns Edexcel, an education and examination board. Edexcel has produced qualifications which link to Pearson texts, although Edexcel also continues to endorse textbooks published by other companies. Edexcel has also faced criticism over repeated leaks of exam material in consecutive years; police investigations into some of the incidents were referred to prosecutors. In June 2010, Pearson plc received notification that the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) founded by Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a sovereign fund, had acquired 24,431,000 shares within the company via Euroclear. On further investigation, Pearson said the LIA may have acquired an additional 2,141,179 shares, resulting in a total interest of 26,572,179 shares. At the time, this represented a major holding of 3.27% within the company and the investment was worth around ¬£280 million.

It is a remake of the 1983 French film Les Comp√®res. In the film, Collette Andrews (Kinski) enlists two former lovers, cynical lawyer Jack Lawrence (Crystal) and lonely, ex-hippie, suicidal writer Dale Putley (Williams) to help her search for her runaway teenage son Scott by telling each man that he is the father. When Jack and Dale run into each other and find out what is happening, they work together to find Scott and determine the identity of the actual father. The film features an appearance by the musical group Sugar Ray. It was a major critical and commercial failure. Plot Scott Andrews, a 17-year-old, runs away from home with his girlfriend, Nikki. His mother Collette visits her ex-boyfriend, lawyer Jack Lawrence, and tells him that Scott is really his son and wants him to find the boy: Jack refuses at first, but Collette pries him into it. Meanwhile, writer Dale Putley is planning suicide when he gets a phone call from Collette, of whom he is another ex-boyfriend, and she tells him the same story. Realizing that his appointment with a client will keep him in town overnight, Jack decides that he will look for Scott. Both men start their search with Russ, Nikki's father. Dale and Jack get little help from Russ, but it does lead to them meeting each other. They mistakenly assume that they each have a different missing son, thinking that \\"both boys\\" are mixed up with Nikki. They decide to pursue their cases together. Jack and Dale visit Nikki's mother, Shirley, and learn that Nikki went on the road to follow rock band Sugar Ray. When she asks the men for pictures of their sons, they finally realize that Collette has told them both the same story about being Scott's father. They call Collette, who confesses that she doesn't know which is the father, but begs them to find Scott then they'll settle the situation. The two agree and they head for Sacramento where they find Scott, drunk, lovestruck and dumped by Nikki. They bring Scott back to their hotel room, and when he wakes the next day, he is not pleased by the news that one of them might be his father and that Nikki is following Sugar Ray. Jack leaves Dale to watch over Scott, but Scott escapes by pouring coffee over Dale's testicles. Dale reaches Jack and they head to Reno, where Sugar Ray's next performance will be. In Reno, Scott meets up with Nikki and the other devotees following the band. He meets up with two drug dealers that he scammed out of $5,000 that he used to buy a necklace for Nikki. He escapes, only to be accidentally run down by Jack and Dale. Now with a broken arm, Scott demands that his two fathers leave him alone. That night, the three finally start to bond when Scott opens up to Jack and DaleNikki is his first love, but his parents disapprove of her, so he ran away. When Scott tells his two fathers about the drug dealers, they decide to help him. They drive to Nikki's hotel, but when Jack and Dale go inside, the drug dealers spot Scott in the car and plan to kidnap and kill him. Scott escapes with Jack's rental car. When the two fathers emerge from the hotel, Jack assumes that Scott had been lying to them the whole time, calls it quits and decides to go home. Just then, Jack's wife Carrie appears, following Jack (and Dale) because she's been confused and concerned given Jack's odd behavior. He tells her the truth about Scott, and that he could be the father. Dale departs while Jack and Carrie have an argument about Jack's negative feelings for Scott, making her scared of how he'll react with his own child. Jack sees her point, and heads to the Sugar Ray concert, finding that Dale is also there looking for Scott. They find him as he confronts Nikki, who breaks up with him. Heartbroken, Scott is suddenly grabbed by the drug dealers, whom Dale and Jack attack, resulting in a huge fight erupting within the concert crowd. Freed from jail the next day, Jack, Dale, and Scott head home where Collette and his father Bob embrace with their son. Collette tells Scott the truth that neither Jack nor Dale is his father, but Scott is touched that his parents wanted him home so bad. Before the two men leave, Scott lies to both, separately and privately, that they're the father. Jack figures out that Scott lied, but is rather happy as it has given him a new outlook over having children. Dale, riding in Jack's car, spots a woman having car trouble on her way to the airport. Upon finding out that Virginia is single, Dale takes a shot and decides to take her to her destination by car, much to Jack's annoyance.

Release In South Africa, Fathers' Day was released as What's Up Pop's?, a title the distributor decided would be more appropriate for the local market. The name was subsequently changed to What's Up Pops? for DVD release, when the studio realized the apostrophe had been used incorrectly. Reception The film received generally negative reviews from critics and was commercially unsuccessful as well. It holds a 25% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 59 reviews, with an average score of 4.18/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"A maudlin misfire, Fathers' Day manages the difficult task of making both Billy Crystal and Robin Williams woefully unfunny\\". Julia Louis-Dreyfus was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress for her work in the film, where she lost to Alicia Silverstone for Batman & Robin. The film was also nominated for Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards but barely lost to 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag.

Ukrainian is natively written in its own Ukrainian alphabet, which is based on the Cyrillic script. Romanization may be employed to represent Ukrainian text or pronunciation for non-Ukrainian readers, on computer systems that cannot reproduce Cyrillic characters, or for typists who are not familiar with the Ukrainian keyboard layout. Methods of romanization include transliteration, representing written text, and transcription, representing the spoken word. In contrast to romanization, there have been several historical proposals for a native Ukrainian Latin alphabet, usually based on those used by West Slavic languages, but none has caught on. Romanization systems Part of a table of letters of the alphabet for the Ruthenian language, from Ivan Uzhevych's Hrammatyka Slovenskaja (1645). Columns show the letter names printed, in manuscript Cyrillic and Latin, common Cyrillic letterforms, and the Latin transliteration. Part 2, part 3. =Transliteration= Transliteration is the letter-for-letter representation of text using another writing system. Rudnyckyj classified transliteration systems into the scholarly system, used in academic and especially linguistic works, and practical systems, used in administration, journalism, in the postal system, in schools, etc.Rudnyckyj 1948, p. 1. The scholarly or scientific system is used internationally, with very little variation, while the various practical methods of transliteration are adapted to the orthographical conventions of other languages, like English, French, German, etc. Depending on the purpose of the transliteration it may be necessary to be able to reconstruct the original text, or it may be preferable to have a transliteration which sounds like the original language when read aloud. International scholarly system Also called scientific transliteration, this system is most often seen in linguistic publications on Slavic languages. It is purely phonemic, meaning each character represents one meaningful unit of sound, and is based on the Croatian Latin alphabet.Transliteration Timeline on the website of the University of Arizona Library It was codified in the 1898 Prussian Instructions for libraries, or Preu√üische Instruktionen (PI). It was later adopted by the International Organization for Standardization, with minor differences, as ISO/R 9. Representing all of the necessary diacritics on computers requires Unicode, Latin-2, Latin-4, or Latin-7 encoding. Other Slavic based romanizations occasionally seen are those based on the Slovak alphabet or the Polish alphabet, which include symbols for palatalized consonants. Library of Congress system The ALA-LC Romanization Tables, published by the American Library Association (1885) and Library of Congress (1905). Used to represent bibliographic information by US and Canadian libraries, by the British Library since 1975,‚ÄúSearching for Cyrillic items in the catalogues of the British Library: guidelines and transliteration tables‚Äù and in North American publications. The latest 1997 revision is very similar to the 1905 version. Requires Unicode for connecting diacritics‚Äîthese are used in bibliographies and catalogues, but typically omitted in running text. British Standard British Standard 2979:1958, from BSI, is used by the Oxford University Press.Oxford Style Manual (2003), \\"Slavonic Languages\\", s 11.41.2, p 350. Oxford University Press. A variation is used by the British Museum and British Library, but since 1975 their new acquisitions have been catalogued using Library of Congress transliteration. BGN/PCGN BGN/PCGN romanization is a series of standards approved by the United States Board on Geographic Names and Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use. Pronunciation is intuitive for English-speakers. For Ukrainian, the former BGN/PCGN system was adopted in 1965, but superseded there by the Ukrainian National System in 2019. A modified version is also mentioned in the Oxford Style Manual. Requires only ASCII characters if optional separators are not used. GOST (1971, 1983)/Derzhstandart (1995) The Soviet Union's GOST, COMECON's SEV, and Ukraine's Derzhstandart are government standards bodies of the former Eurasian communist countries. They published a series of romanization systems for Ukrainian, which were replaced by ISO 9:1995. For details, see GOST 16876-71. ISO 9:1995 ISO 9 is a standard from the International Organization for Standardization. It supports most national Cyrillic alphabets in a single transliteration table. Each Cyrillic character is represented by exactly one unique Latin character, so the transliteration is reliably reversible. This was originally derived from the Scholarly system in 1954, and is meant to be usable by readers of most European languages. The 1995 revision considers only graphemes and disregards phonemic differences. So, for example, –≥ (Ukrainian He or Russian Ge) is always represented by the transliteration g; “ë (Ukrainian letter Ge) is represented by gÃÄ. Representing all of the necessary diacritics on computers requires Unicode, and a few characters are rarely present in computer fonts, for example g-grave: gÃÄ. Ukrainian National transliteration This is the official system of Ukraine, also employed by the United Nations and many countries' foreign services. It is currently widely used to represent Ukrainian geographic names, which were almost exclusively romanized from Russian before Ukraine's independence in 1991, and for personal names in passports. It is based on English orthography, and requires only ASCII characters with no diacritics. Its first version was codified in Decision No. 9 of the Ukrainian Committee on Issues of Legal Terminology on April 19, 1996,–†—ñ—à–µ–Ω–Ω—è –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó –ö–æ–º—ñ—Å—ñ—ó –∑ –ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω—å –ø—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏—á–æ—ó —Ç–µ—Ä–º—ñ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥—ñ—ó (in Ukrainian) stating that the system is binding for the transliteration of Ukrainian names in English in legislative and official acts. A new official system was introduced for transliteration of Ukrainian personal names in Ukrainian passports in 2007. An updated 2010 version became the system is used for transliterating all proper names and was approved as Resolution 55 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, January 27, 2010.Resolution no. 55 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, January 27, 2010Romanization system in Ukraine, paper presented on East Central and South- East Europe Division of the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names This modified earlier laws and brought together a unified system for official documents, publication of cartographic works, signs and indicators of inhabited localities, streets, stops, subway stations, etc. It has been adopted internationally. The 27th session of the UN Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN) held in New York 30 July and 10 August 2012The 27th session of the UNGEGN materials on the UN site. after a report by the State Agency of Land Resources of Ukraine (now known as Derzhheokadastr: Ukraine State Service of Geodesy, Cartography and Cadastre) expertsThe document prepared for the UNGEGN session by Ukrainian Experts. approved the Ukrainian system of romanization.The article about the UNGEGN 27th session on the official State of The Agency of Land Resources of Ukraine site. The BGN/PCGN jointly adopted the system in 2020. Official geographic names are romanized directly from the original Ukrainian and not translated. For example, Kyivska oblast not Kyiv Oblast, Pivnichnokrymskyi kanal not North Crimean Canal. Romanization for other languages than English Romanization intended for readers of other languages than English is usually transcribed phonetically into the familiar orthography. For example, y, kh, ch, sh, shch for anglophones may be transcribed j, ch, tsch, sch, schtsch for German readers (for letters –π, —Ö, —á, —à, —â), ir it may be rendered in Latin letters according to the normal orthography of another Slavic language, such as Polish or Croatian (such as the established scholarly system, which is described above). Ad hoc romanization Users of public-access computers or mobile text messaging services sometimes improvise informal romanization due to limitations in keyboard or character set. These may include both sound- alike and look-alike letter substitutions. Example: YKPAIHCbKA ABTOPKA for \\"–£–ö–†–ê–á–ù–°–¨–ö–ê –ê–í–¢–û–†–ö–ê\\". See also Volapuk encoding. This system uses the available character set. Ukrainian telegraph code For telegraph transmission. Each separate Ukrainian letter had a 1:1 equivalence to a Latin letter. Latin Q, W, V, and X are equivalent to Ukrainian –Ø (or sometimes –©), –í, –ñ, –¨. Other letters are transcribed phonetically. This equivalency is used in building the KOI8-U table. =Transcription= Transcription is the representation of the spoken word. Phonological, or phonemic, transcription represents the phonemes, or meaningful sounds of a language, and is useful to describe the general pronunciation of a word. Phonetic transcription represents every single sound, or phone, and can be used to compare different dialects of a language. Both methods can use the same sets of symbols, but linguists usually denote phonemic transcriptions by enclosing them in slashes / ... /, while phonetic transcriptions are enclosed in square brackets [ ... ]. ; IPA The International Phonetic Alphabet precisely represents pronunciation. Requires a special Unicode font. Conventional romanization of proper names In many contexts, it is common to use a modified system of transliteration that strives to be read and pronounced naturally by anglophones. Such transcriptions are also used for the surnames of people of Ukrainian ancestry in English-speaking countries (personal names have often been translated to equivalent or similar English names, e.g., \\"Alexander\\" for Oleksandr, \\"Terry\\" for Taras). Typically such a modified transliteration is based on the ALA-LC, or Library of Congress (in North America), or, less commonly, the British Standard system. Such a simplified system usually omits diacritics and tie-bars from iÕ°e, √Ø or ƒ≠, often simplifies -yƒ≠ and -iƒ≠ word endings to \\"-y\\", omits romanizing the Ukrainian soft sign (—å) and apostrophe (‚Äô), and may substitute ya, ye, yu, yo for ia, ie, iu, io at the beginnings of words. It may also simplify doubled letters. Unlike in the English language where an apostrophe is punctuation, in the Ukrainian language it is a letter. Therefore sometimes Rus‚Äô is translated with an apostrophe, even when the apostrophe is dropped for most other names and words. Conventional transliterations can reflect the history of a person or place. Many well-known spellings are based on transcriptions into another Latin alphabet, such as the German or Polish. Others are transcribed from equivalent names in other languages, for example Ukrainian Pavlo (\\"Paul\\") may be called by the Russian equivalent Pavel, Ukrainian Kyiv by the Russian equivalent Kiev. The employment of romanization systems can become complex. For example, the English translation of Kubijovyƒç's Ukraine: A Concise Encyclop√¶dia uses a modified Library of Congress (ALA-LC) system as outlined above for Ukrainian and Russian names‚Äîwith the exceptions for endings or doubled consonants applying variously to personal and geographic names. For technical reasons, maps in the Encyclopedia follow different conventions. Names of persons are anglicized in the encyclopedia's text, but also presented in their original form in the index. Various geographic names are presented in their anglicized, Russian, or both Ukrainian and Polish forms, and appear in several forms in the index. Scholarly transliteration is used in linguistics articles. The Encyclopedia's explanation of its transliteration and naming convention occupies 2-1/2 pages.

Founded in 1964, it was part of the national initiative to promote tertiary foreign language education. The institute grew out of a 1956-established subsidiary of Xinhua News Agency Note: the author is former Chairman of Xinhua News Agency. and has developed into one of the most notable universities of foreign languages and cultural studies in China. Today, the University pioneers in the fields of tourism studies, hospitality management and international trade. It maintains links with national institutions including the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Tourism Administration. In addition, it holds formal collaborative agreements with more than 140 universities and academic institutions of about 40 countries spanning the continents, providing a wide range of study opportunities for inbound and outbound students alike. According to the China Education and Research Network, the University is ranked fourth for the most satisfactory international admissions and services among Chinese universities. BISU sits primarily in the central east of Chaoyang District, home to the city's CBD and the majority of foreign embassies. It is broadly organised into four academic divisions‚ÄîArts, Management, Economics and Political Sciences‚Äîwithin which there are 19 main departments and institutes, facilitated with numerous research centers, laboratories, interdisciplinary units and supporting services. History The history of Beijing International Studies University dates back to the 1950s, when People's Republic of China started to gain international recognition and the need emerged for proficient foreign language speakers. In the early 1960s, after completing the 14-country state visit, the then-Premier Zhou Enlai initiated the Seven-Year Plan for Foreign Language Education and proposed to establish the Beijing Second Foreign Languages Institute, now known as the Beijing International Studies University. The whole founding process was under the supervision of Zhou. =Origins= Beijing Mining Institute. It was proposed by the then Premier Zhou Enlai to the State Council and the establishment of Beijing International Studies University was given the highest priority. A report for the establishment of BISU was subsequently presented and approved at the State Council in March and later in August, the land where the University has maintained the presence of its main site was granted. The first 646 students enrolled in September and the Establishment Ceremony was held on 24 October 1964. The University Anniversary has been celebrated on that day ever since. =Development= The original curriculum framework of the University was built upon its core units in foreign languages, in addition to Chinese literature, arts and philosophy, international/domestic relations, political economy and physical education. It offered degree programs for 14 foreign languages, including English, French, Spanish, Arabic, German, Japanese, Albanian, Romanian, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Bulgarian, Serbian and Vietnamese. Affiliated with the Commission for Cultural Relations of Foreign Countries‚Äîthe predecessor of today's Culture Ministry‚Äîthe University underwent rapid growth until 1966, when the Cultural Revolution started. The University then changed administration several times over this period, successively administered by the Foreign Ministry (1968), the Beijing Government (1971), the Ministry of Education (1978) and the National Tourism Administration (1983). In 1981, the report jointly submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade and the University was approved at the Education Ministry; the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was established at BISU. Concurrently, in the same year, the National Tourism Administration set up the major of tourism management in BISU, making it the earliest shaper of Chinese tourism education. During the 1980s and 1990s, Beijing International Studies University, also known as the China Tourism Institute, prevailed in both teaching and research and was recognised as one of the foremost tertiary institutions for tourism studies. =2003‚Äîpresent= Main Hall, Beijing International Studies University, September 2006 Until 2003, BISU was known as Beijing Second Foreign Language University; the name changed to reflect the increasing diversity of programs offered by the University. Its multi-disciplinary academic structure has been established since the 1990s and 2000s, best known for its business administration programs and foreign languages programs. The University now offers language courses in English, Japanese, German, Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Korean and Chinese as a foreign language for international students. It is one of the first authorised HSK test centers based in Beijing, and has been recognised as one of Beijing's best universities for Chinese study. In 2013, the University engaged in a major academic restructuring within its Business and Economics disciplines. In July, the former School of Tourism Management was dissolved, with Departments of Tourism Management and Hotel Management promoted to independent Schools, Departments of Marketing and Financial Management combined to form the School of International Business, and the Department of Event Management merged into the School of Economics and Trade. The move was part of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan of the University, intending to endorse greater academic autonomy, take advantage of its heritage in tourism-related subjects and thus to effectively position itself in respond to the changes in the marketplace. = Timeline = Former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, founder of Beijing International Studies University. 1964‚Äì1966: Humble beginnings The first 22 BISU lecturers of international backgrounds, 1960s.Interview with Wang Wenjiong , 21 December 2012, BMC.

It houses the main teaching facilities and student amenities, and benefits from excellent public transport links with access to metro subway line 6 and 8T. The University also maintains facilities in other parts of the city. It owns an independently run Hospitality Institute in Daxing and has two branch colleges, one at the boundary between Fengtai and Haidian Districts, and one on the outskirts between the inner city and the County of Miyun. In addition, a new site is projected to be built in Tongzhou from 2013. = Main Campus = BISU's central campus occupies a 55.2-acre (223,334 m3) site in the vicinity of the Guomao neighbourhood, about 5 miles (8.8 km) east of the Central CBD. It neighbours the Communication University of China from the West Gate and has two main entrances on Jianguo Road (South Entrance) and Chaoyang Road (North Entrance), both with bus stops located within walking distance. The campus is featured by a mixture of contemporary and antique architecture which is naturally integrated into the landscape. While situated in the urban area, it is honoured Garden Campus and has maintained this title since 1994. In 1997, it was named the city's Model Campus. The central campus boasts five major teaching buildings and four auditoriums, six student halls of residence, a comprehensive learning hub and the university library. Full meals and light fare are available at two dining halls and five specialty restaurants, in addition to three corner stores offering snacks and drinks. Vending machines are on the ground floor of the International Lodge. In addition, it contains most of the sports facilities, including an outdoor stadium with two volleyball courts and six basketball courts, an indoor gymnasium, four tennis courts and an aquatic center. Other amenities include a supermarket, two copy shops, a book store and a post office. A pharmacy and an ICBC bank branch are located at the North Entrance, opposite to the Tian-Ke-Long shopping mall on the other side of the road. The university press Tourism Education Press headquarter office is also located nearby. The northern campus houses the School of Continuing Education and the Study Abroad Resource Center. The Yi- Shui-Fang-Yuan campus in the south is the new residential area developed in 2011. Separated by the Jingtong Expressway from the central campus, it is centered on a peaceful site along the Tonghui River and provides housing facilities for most of the undergraduate and postgraduate students. =Tongzhou Campus= In 2013, a branch campus is expected to be built in Tongzhou District, the new City Sub-Center of Beijing. The University President Zhou Lie disclosed in January that the new site would be located in Lucheng, neighbouring the east campus of Renmin University and Peking Union Medical College, with only a 20-minute drive to the central campus. As of March 2013, the University has held conferences and seminars on feasibility analysis of the project, with regard to the 2013‚Äî2020 Outline of National Tourism and Leisure released by the State Council in February. Academics =Structure= A Discipline in the Beijing International Studies University is a broad administrative concept for categorising related academic units. The disciplinary divisions usually differentiate the degrees awarded. Currently, the academic system of Beijing International Studies University is made up of four disciplines: Arts (languages, literature, cultural studies and philosophy), Business Administration, Economics Sciences and Law and Political Sciences. Teaching and research at BISU is organised by departments, schools and institutes. Schools may establish subsidiary departments and other subordinate institutions because of the organisational history or operational needs. Institutes are graduate schools that conduct research projects aside of the course plan, usually in collaboration with the municipality government or national institutes (otherwise graduate schools are affiliated to schools and departments themselves). In addition, there are supporting entities for teaching and research, including six teaching and research offices for compulsory subjects, the University Press, and the University Library. As of 2013, there are about 50 departments, schools and other institutions running the four Disciplines of the University. The major academic units are: * School of English Language, Literature and Culture * School of Japanese Language, Literature and Culture * School of Arabic Language, Literature and Culture * School of Western European Languages * School of Central European Languages * School of Oriental Languages * School of Interpreting and Translation * Russian Department * School of Tourism Management * School of Hospitality Management * School of Economics, Trade and Event Management * School of Arts and Humanities * School of Chinese * School of Marxism * School of English Education * International School of Business * International School of Law * School of International Communication * Institute of International Relations * School of Non-common Languages * School of Continuing Education * School of General Education = Organisations = Institute of Tourism Development Founded in 1984, the Research Institute of Tourism Development is one of the oldest and foremost intelligence units in the field of tourism development planning in China. Equipped with its three research affiliates, i.e. Center for Strategic Planning, Center for Theoretical Research and Center for Industry Consulting, the Institute cooperates extensively with the National Tourism Administration, local authorities and key industry players, contributing to around 20 provincial and municipal industry development projects including those of the renowned tourism cities of Sanya, Haikou and Zhangjiagang, in addition to more than 50 executive and feasibility reports on national resorts districts, national nature reserve areas and ecotourism destinations, such as the Lake Tai Resort in Suzhou, the Changbai Mountains Natural Reserve in Jilin, and the Pagsum Lake Ecotourism Area in Tibet. In 1998, the Institute became part of the National Database for Tourism Management; since 1999, authorised by the Education Ministry, it starts to provide postgraduate coursework and research programs for Tourism Management, with research directions on theory-based strategic study of the operational mechanisms and policy-making within tourism sectors, and on practice-led tourism planning and development projects, integrating theories from business management, science, sociology and architecture. The Institute maintains strong links with China Tourism Academy and leading enterprises within the industry. Institute for Transcultural Studies The Institute for Transcultural Studies (ITS) is a specialised research institution for arts and humanities. Initially founded as Institute for Comparative Literature and Transcultural Studies in 2001, the Institute aims to increase intercultural understanding and to promote global presence of Chinese culture by studying classic and contemporary works on philosophy, art and literature from a cross- cultural scope. The ITS cooperates extensively with institutions at the forefront of the domestic academia. The National Center for Foreign Literature Studies was co-founded by the Foreign Literature Institute of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), and the Center for Aesthetics and Art Education is a cooperation program with the Chinese Aesthetics Society. Other notable ITS research branches include Center for Aesthetics and Philosophy, Center for Comparative Literature and Poetics and Center for Sino-Greco Cultural Studies, all of which enjoy sound relationships with universities and research institutions overseas. Institutes of Linguistics and Applied Linguistics (Chinese and foreign languages) Research profiles =Tourism studies= BISU's academic leadership in tourism studies can be traced back to the early 1980s, when the Chinese Tourism Ministry took charge of the University and supported the development of its tourism majors, making it the pioneer in the field of tourism education in China. The University initiated the Cross-Strait Tourism Seminar in 2008, and has been hosting the China Tourism Development, Beijing Dialogue Forum annually since 2004, with strong support from the Beijing Tourism Administration. In 2004, the Research Center for Beijing Tourism Development () was established at BISU, funded by the Tourism Administration, the Education Commission and the Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science (BJPOPSS) of the Beijing government. The Center is one of the first BJPOPSS-accredited research institutions and is positioned as the government's think tank, which facilitated the city's tourism planning and development during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. As of 2008, the Center has established tourism-themed databases including the information integration platform for China tourism industry, the language material portal for Beijing-based professional tour guides, observatories and databases for tourism impacts and sustainability analysis, etc. In addition, during the period from 2005 to 2012, the Center accomplished around 70 research projects of significance, including the Annual Report of Beijing Tourism Development, the China Tourism Studies and the International Tourism Studies. Only projects from the columns Research Achievements and Academic Papers are taken into account. In collaboration with the China Tourism Academy, the research arm of the National Tourism Administration, the China Hospitality Industry Research Center () was founded in 2009, being referred to as a research institution \\"of key industries which ha[s] been selected from the over 1000 academies of tourism all over China\\". According to the International Journal of Hospitality Management, during the period from 1978 to 2008, BISU is among the top 3 contributors to the academic research on Chinese tourism and hospitality management, and the Research Center Director Professor Gu Huimin is one of the top 8 intensely contributing authors worldwide. =Cultural studies= The National Institute of Cultural Development () is China's first state-level culture industry institute, co- established by the Chinese Culture Ministry and BISU in 2010. The Institute grew out of BISU's Research Center of International Trade in Services and International Cultural Trade, which was founded in 2006, aiming to promote Chinese culture from an economic and trade perspective, and to facilitate the cultural reform of the nation. It remains engaged in academic collaboration at both the domestic and international levels, and has developed into both a research platform for international cultural trade and an educational base for training specialised personnel. In 2013, as the only academic forum of its kind in China, the Annual Forum for International Trade in Services (Beijing), which has been co-hosted by BISU and the China Association of International Trade (CAIT) since 2007, became part of the MOFCOM-hosted 2nd China International Fair for Trade in Service. In 2012, the Global Media and Cultural Soft Power Laboratory () was jointly established by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Beijing International Studies University. It is a research and consulting institution primarily specialised in studies on mass media and cross-platform convergence, and cultural diplomacy development. Focusing on policies and practices associated with soft power, the Laboratory looks into issues of cultural trends and phenomena, media flows, and consumption behaviours on media products‚Äîespecially in terms of film and television industries‚Äîwith analytical precision. The Laboratory is currently the only academic organisation on soft power development in China, and is supported by CCTV and the China Publishing Group. Center for Literary Theory and Criticism Center for International Journalism and Media Studies =International studies= In 2012, the MOE Project of Arab Research Center () was inaugurated at BISU. It is one of the three university- based Arab studies institutions selected into the MOE Project of International Studies Research Institutes in China. It is to conduct comprehensive studies on the Arab world, reaching out into topics including politics, economics, culture, arts, history, social conditions, religion and humanities; the research force of the Center is primarily drawn from research fellows and academic staff of the Department of Arabic Studies, joint by multidisciplinary professionals and the Distinguished Experts, Li Shaoxian, VP of the top-ranked Asian think tank China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, and Liu Zhentang, former Chinese Ambassador to the Middle East. According to the University President Zhou Lie, the Center is positioned to be both the think tank and the intelligence unit in the fields of academics, personnel development, decision-making consulting and international communication. In the same year of 2012, the Center for Global Public Opinion and Audience Research () was established. It is an academic alliance between BISU and the China Foreign Languages Publishing Administration. Based on comparative research of national/regional profiles, the Center mainly focuses on opinion tracking, public diplomacy studies and the development of international cultural communication.  Institute of International Relations  = Language studies = Although BISU's School of Interpreting and Translation is relatively young (the first students of which commenced in 2007), it is now one of the only four Chinese universities recognised by the international translation studies academy CIUTI. As of 2011, 16 professors and academic staff of BISU have received the Lifetime Achievement Award in Translation bestowed by the Translators Association of China (TAC). In 2011, the Institute of China Translation Development () was set up in BISU. Cooperating with TAC, the Institute is the first national research center focused on the translation industry in China. Its expertise lies mainly in theory development and professional practice of translation and interpreting. In 2012, it released the first ever Annual Report on China‚Äôs Language Services Industry at the National Conference on Translation, which was regarded as remarkable contribution to the industry. It also seeks collaboration with the industry and international organisations, and is supported by CIUTI and the China Foreign Languages Publishing Administration. In 2013, to strengthen the partnership a step further, the Training Center for China Translation Industry (), another TAC-affiliated organisation was also established at BISU.  Global partnerships  To share teaching and research experience and to facilitate student exchanges, the University maintains links with universities and academic institutions on all continents. , the University has cooperations with more than 130 global partners. It is also one of the 20 Chinese universities selected to the UNESCO China-Africa collaborative initiative. = Inbound study = Beijing International Studies University is renowned for its international students education across the country, both in terms of student capacity and teaching quality. In 2002 and 2004, with over 8,000 long-term and 2,000 short-term international students from more than 70 countries studying at the University, BISU was named twice Outstanding Academic Institution for International Students Education by the Education Commission of the government. For the academic year 2013/2014, BISU is one of the only two Beijing-based universities (altogether eight across the nation) entrusted by China Scholarship Council to provide foundation programs to international undergraduate students. As a higher education institution entitled to admit Chinese Government Scholarship students, BISU provides a wide range of degree programs for students from all over the world, including 20 undergraduate programs and 11 postgraduate programs, all open to Chinese Government Scholarship applications. As of 2007, around 40 percent of the international undergraduates and 20 percent of the non-degree language students received the scholarships per semester, with the highest award level amounting to . In addition to the government incentives, the University has established its own merit-based International Scholarships and all the overseas students at BISU are equally entitled to apply. = Confucius Institutes =   Student life =Event highlights= * First-Year Welcome Party ‚Äî Each year, the BISU Union has set time aside to run a welcome party for all new students. It is normally scheduled on the first Sunday evening prior to classes, after the jun xun has finished. Notable societies will put on some performance at the party, including stage play, dubbing, dancing and singing, integrating \\"first year must-know\\" elements into their shows. * German Week ‚Äî A week-long festival celebrating BISU in the autumn/winter, usually referred to as the Cultural Week of German Speaking Countries. It is hosted by the Student Union of Department of German Studies and entails a variety of events, including an opening ceremony, an annually held inter-university German speech contest, the highlight event MoreFun Wednesday Night Show, a tour of photographic exhibitions, a film night, a themed costume ball and a closing party. It is an interactive display of the diverse culture of German speaking countries including Germany, Austria, Schwizerland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. Ambassadors from these countries will join the line-up of the opening ceremony, where typical German-style snacks and beverages are served free of charge and a series of micro fairs are held on topics including tourists attractions, sports, education, politics, literature, media, etc. * Forums ‚Äî An umbrella term for all the ongoing and long-term communication initiatives hosted by varied academic units of BISU. It currently comprises the Youth Elites Forum, the Boya Forum and the Career Forum, inviting personalities from the media, the political arena and literary and art circles to interact with students. Notable guests include Li Zhaoxing, Zhang Qiyue, Jin Guihua; Wang Meng, Liang Xiaosheng, Yuan Tengfei, Ji Lianhai, Rao Xueman; Jo√´l Bellassen, Lu Jiande; Sa Beining, Han Qiaosheng, Zhang Shaogang, Chun Ni; Wang Gengnian, Sun Yusheng. * French and Italian Week hosted by the Department of French and Italian Studies. * Christmas and New Year's Eve Party Night hosted by the SCA BISU. * Kohaku Uta Gassen hosted by the School of Japanese Language. * Sing Competition hosted by the BISU Union. * All that music Live Concert hosted by RAY Music. * Chinese Debating Competition. =Media= XiangYu News is the University's student-run news agency. It is supported and supervised by the University Relations, incorporating the major media: * BISU Television, usually abbreviated as BSTV, the student-run television station at BISU. The biggest project for BSTV each year is to make graduation video that is played during the graduation ceremony. * Voice of Erwai (VOE, or in ), the BISU radio station * BISU Press Corps, BISU's student-journalists association, responsible for the University publication BISU Newspaper and the online news delivery at BMC, the BISU Media Center. =Self-Governance= Across the University, there are two major student-led governing bodies: Beijing International Studies University Student Union, usually known as the BISU Union, which is the official representative body of the University students, and the China Youth League BISU (CCYL BISU), which is a student council running on the party pattern. In addition, Students' Community Association BISU (SCA BISU) is another student organisation at the university level, which is in charge of the management of clubs and societies of the University. All of the three student groups organise inter-university events, ranging from culture festivals and sports races, flea markets and party shows, to career fairs and academic seminars, or volunteering activities and leadership programs, aiming to promote social interactions and community involvement of the students, and to engage both domestic and international students to join and enjoy the BISU family. =Clubs and societies= Most of the student societies at the University are associated under SCA BISU, initiated by individuals of same interests and hobbies. Application for setting up new societies is open to University students at the beginning of each semester. Most overseas students find societies for the particular language and culture from where they come from. There are groups for Chinese culture appreciation that are open to all. Academic and profession-oriented societies is another facet of the student clubs, such as the Business Negotiation Club and the International investment & Management Association (IIMA). Besides, in recent years, organisations on leadership development and community engagement has shown phenomenal growth at BISU, especially the AIESEC, the Association for Green Environments and the Warm Hope Volunteering. There are high-standard university wide sports teams, most notably the flag football team The Bombers, who has had significant performances in the national leagues. Attention is also given to The Soccer BISU and The Basketball BISU, whose half-yearly competitions attracted thousands of audience to the field. Badminton, tennis and ping-pong tournaments are held annually on campus. Besides, there are interest groups for outdoor activities such as running (The Runner), martial arts (The BAMA) and roller skating (S-Power). In 2009, the Beijing International Studies University Students Art Troupe was established, supervised under CCYL BISU. It acts as the bridge of Chinese performing arts between BISU students, other national universities and the public. The Art Troupe features a wide range of forms of performing arts, comprising the Choir, the Dance Group, the Orchestra and Percussion Group and the Drama and Recitation Group. Besides, there exist arts societies, which operate independently to the Students Art Troupe, which are among the most popular interest groups at BISU, including The Charming Voice (voice acting), The Compass (stage play), The PLUF Crew (dancing) and The RAY Music. Other notable societies include The Mystery Society, The September (computer), The SSS (bicycle touring), The BISU Photographic Society, The Modelin (fashion catwalk) and The Minor (anime, comics and cosplay).

By coating particles of a heavy metal with a gene of interest and firing these micro-projectiles into cells using mechanical force, an integration of desired genetic information can be induced into cells. The technique involved with such micro-projectile delivery of DNA is often referred to as biolistics. This device is able to transform almost any type of cell and is not limited to the transformation of the nucleus; it can also transform organelles, including plastids and mitochondria. A gene gun is used for delivery of exogenous DNA to cells. This method is known as 'biolistics'. Gene guns can be used effectively on most cells but are mainly used on plant cells. Step 1 The gene gun apparatus is ready to fire. Step 2 Helium fills the chamber and pressure builds against the rupture disk. Step 3 The pressure eventually reaches the point where the rupture disk breaks, and the resulting burst of helium propels the DNA/gold-coated macrocarrier ('Plastic Disk') into the stopping screen. Step 4 When the macrocarrier hits the stopping screen, the DNA-coated gold particles are propelled through the screen and into the target cells. Gene gun design The gene gun was originally a Crosman air pistol modified to fire dense tungsten particles. It was invented by John C Sanford, Ed Wolf, and Nelson Allen at Cornell University along with Ted Klein of DuPont between 1983 and 1986. The original target was onions (chosen for their large cell size), and the device was used to deliver particles coated with a marker gene which would relay a signal if proper insertion of the DNA transcript occurred. Genetic transformation was the demonstrated upon observed expression of the marker gene within onion cells. The earliest custom manufactured gene guns (fabricated by Nelson Allen) used a 22 caliber nail gun cartridge to propel a polyethylene cylinder (bullet) down a 22 caliber Douglas barrel. A droplet of the tungsten powder coated with genetic material was placed onto the bullet and shot down into a Petri dish below. The bullet welded to the disk below the Petri plate, and the genetic material blasted into the sample with a doughnut effect involving devastation in the middle of the sample with a ring of good transformation around the periphery. The gun was connected to a vacuum pump and was placed under a vacuum while firing. The early design was put into limited production by a Rumsey-Loomis (a local machine shop then at Mecklenburg Road in Ithaca, NY, USA). Biolistics, Inc sold Dupont the rights to manufacture and distribute an updated device with improvements including the use of helium as a non- explosive propellant and a multi-disk collision delivery mechanism to minimize damage to sample tissues. Other heavy metals such as gold and silver are also used to deliver genetic material with gold being favored due to lower cytotoxicity in comparison to tungsten projectile carriers.  Biolistic construct design  Biolistic transformation involves the integration of a functional fragment of DNA‚Äîknown as a DNA construct‚Äîinto target cells. A gene construct is a DNA cassette containing all required regulatory elements for proper expression within the target organism. While gene constructs may vary in their design depending on the desired outcome of the transformation procedure, all constructs typically contain a combination a promoter sequence, a terminator sequence, the gene of interest, and a reporter gene. Promoter: Promoters control the location and magnitude of gene expression and function as ‚Äúthe steering wheel and gas pedal‚Äù of a gene. Promoters precede the gene of interest in the DNA construct and can be changed through laboratory design to fine-tune transgene expression. The 35S promoter from Cauliflower mosaic virus is an example of a commonly used promoter that results in robust constitutive gene expression within plants. Terminator: Terminator sequences are required for proper gene expression and are placed after the coding region of the gene of interest within the DNA construct. A common terminator for biolistic transformation is the NOS terminator derived from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Due to the high frequency of use of this terminator in genetically engineered plants, strategies have been developed to detect its presence within the food supply to monitor for unauthorized GE crops. Reporter gene: A gene encoding a selectable marker is a common element within DNA constructs and is used to select for properly transformed cells. The selectable marker chosen will depend on the species being transformed, but it will typically be a gene granting cells a detoxification capacity for certain herbicides or antibiotics such as kanamycin, hygromycin B, or glyphosate. Additional elements: Optional components of a DNA construct include elements such as cre-lox sequences that allow for controlled removal of the construct from the target genome. Such elements are chosen by the construct developer to perform specialized functions alongside the main gene of interest. Application Gene guns are mostly used with plant cells. However, there is much potential use in humans and other animals as well. =Plants= The target of a gene gun is often a callus of undifferentiated plant cells or a group of immature embryos growing on gel medium in a Petri dish. After the DNA-coated gold particles have been delivered to the cells, the DNA is used as a template for transcription (transient expression) and sometimes it integrates into a plant chromosome ('stable' transformation) If the delivered DNA construct contains a selectable marker, then stably transformed cells can be selected and cultured using tissue culture methods. For example, if the delivered DNA construct contains a gene that confers resistance to an antibiotic or herbicide, then stably transformed cells may be selected by including that antibiotic or herbicide in the tissue culture media. Transformed cells can be treated with a series of plant hormones, such as auxins and gibberellins, and each may divide and differentiate into the organized, specialized, tissue cells of an entire plant. This capability of total re-generation is called totipotency. The new plant that originated from a successfully transformed cell may have new traits that are heritable. The use of the gene gun may be contrasted with the use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and its Ti plasmid to insert DNA into plant cells. See transformation for different methods of transformation in different species. =Humans and other animals= Gene guns have also been used to deliver DNA vaccines. The delivery of plasmids into rat neurons through the use of a gene gun, specifically DRG neurons, is also used as a pharmacological precursor in studying the effects of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The gene gun has become a common tool for labeling subsets of cells in cultured tissue. In addition to being able to transfect cells with DNA plasmids coding for fluorescent proteins, the gene gun can be adapted to deliver a wide variety of vital dyes to cells. Gene gun bombardment has also been used to transform Caenorhabditis elegans, as an alternative to microinjection. Advantages Biolistics has proven to be a versatile method of genetic modification and it is generally preferred to engineer transformation-resistant crops, such as cereals. Notably, Bt maize is a product of biolistics. Plastid transformation has also seen great success with particle bombardment when compared to other current techniques, such as Agrobacterium mediated transformation, which have difficulty targeting the vector to and stably expressing in the chloroplast. In addition, there are no reports of a chloroplast silencing a transgene inserted with a gene gun. Additionally, with only one firing of a gene gun, a skilled technician can generate two transformed organisms. This technology has even allowed for modification of specific tissues in situ, although this is likely to damage large numbers of cells and transform only some, rather than all, cells of the tissue. Limitations Biolistics introduces DNA randomly into the target cells. Thus the DNA may be transformed into whatever genomes are present in the cell, be they nuclear, mitochondrial, plasmid or any others, in any combination, though proper construct design may mitigate this. The delivery and integration of multiple templates of the DNA construct is a distinct possibility, resulting in potential variable expression levels and copy numbers of the inserted gene. This is due to the ability of the constructs to give and take genetic material from other constructs, causing some to carry no transgene and others to carry multiple copies; the number of copies inserted depends on both how many copies of the transgene an inserted construct has, and how many were inserted. Also, because eukaryotic constructs rely on illegitimate recombination‚Äîa process by which the transgene is integrated into the genome without similar genetic sequences‚Äîand not homologous recombination, they cannot be targeted to specific locations within the genome, unless the transgene is co-delivered with genome editing reagents.

Paragon Oil was an American oil company, founded in 1925 in New York City by the Schwartz family, and sold to Texaco in the late 1950s. It is not related to the Paragon Oil Company operating today in Brooklyn.  Founding of the company  Paragon Oil was founded by brothers Henry, Irving, Robert, Benjamin, and Arnold Schwartz. The brothers, and their sister Bess Schwartz Levy, were first-generation Americans, all born between 1896 and 1909 in Brooklyn, New York. Their parents were Sam (Sholem) (n√©e Chernofski) Schwartz, born circa June 1866, and Lena (Liba Chasia) Krakofsky, born circa March 1871, who were Jewish immigrants originally from the Mala Berezianka, Kivshovata, Tarascha, and Belaya Tserkov (Bila Tserkva) area, south of Kiev in Kiev oblast, Ukraine, who had immigrated to the United States between 1891 and 1895. The family's original surname had been spelled in various Russian Empire records as Chernofski, Cherninsky, Chernuavsky, and/or Chernyansky, derived from the Russian word for \\"black\\" and was changed to Schwartz, the German word for \\"black\\", upon emigration. Sam was the oldest or second oldest of seven Chernofski/Schwazrtz siblings, six of whom came to the US, and had originally been a leading blacksmith who owned many horses, wagons, and vast property in and around Belaya Tserkov. Despite this well-off background, the family was poor upon arrival in New York. Sam worked once again as a blacksmith, but now in eastern Brooklyn. When they were young, elder brothers Henry and Irving went door-to-door in Brooklyn carrying around sacks of coal on their backs, peddling it to the nearby homes and residential buildings to earn extra money for their family. At that time, some large commercial buildings had oil-fired furnaces, but residential buildings did not. A combination of factors, including the equipment available at their father's blacksmith shop and the experience of their relatives back in Ukraine who were involved in the whale oil business, led to the brothers experimenting, designing, and finally building the first oil heaters designed for residential buildings, which eventually earned the family several patents on the design. Growth of the company As time went on, Paragon Oil eventually switched its focus from building and selling these new residential oil burners to that of an oil distribution company, to supply the residential buildings that now had their new oil burners installed. They eventually won a major contract with New York City in the early 1930s to supply fuel oil to several city-run buildings. Despite this success, they still primarily remained a local operation in the New York area until the end of World War II. Europe was destroyed, and in desperate need of fuel oil. Because of their location close to the New York docks and their unique five gallon container packaging, Paragon Oil won the U.S. government contract as the only oil company to supply Europe with fuel oil during the post-war reconstruction. This contract catapulted the company into national prominence. Later, during the early days of the Cold War, Paragon supplied the U.S. government with oil for their submarines. The company operated a large fleet of fuel delivery trucks around the Northeastern United States, and eventually had several oil tankers. Toy versions of the fuel delivery trucks were even manufactured by the Corgi company. Sale of the company The company continued in operation until the late 1950s. At that point, the brothers were getting older and wished to retire. The company was sold to Texaco in the late 1950s, with the sale becoming final in the early 1960s. The estimated sale price was in excess of $75 million, with the family receiving consulting fees of nearly $1 million per year afterward, as well as Texaco stock. Most of the brothers used the profits from the sale to co-found the Brookdale Foundation, whose research focuses on gerontology and geriatric medicine. They also endowed many other charitable enterprises, primarily centered in the New York metropolitan area. These included the Metropolitan Opera at then-newly built Lincoln Center, several buildings and lecture programs at New York University, several New York City and Long Island hospitals including Mount Sinai Hospital, Fifth Avenue Synagogue, the Maimonides Foundation for Gifted Youth, and at least three graduate schools. Eldest brother Henry Schwartz was married quite late in life to a former nun named Caroline Di Donato (b. 1896 in Ohio), who was also a former nurse and the former Dean of Women at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. Thus, despite his Orthodox Jewish background, he also donated heavily to many Catholic charities and organizations, including endowing The Caroline Di Donato Schwartz building at Seton Hall, which was completed in 1973.  Schwartz family history  Sam's father, Chaim Yael \\"Hyman\\" Chernofski, married Gittel Rifka \\"Gertrude\\" Bobrutsky, daughter of Mordkho \\"Max\\" Bobrutsky and Sarah Fuchs, probably around 1863. Chaim and Sam had started the family into the Whale Oil business during the late 1880s. After the purges in the early 1890s, one part of the family decided to go to America, while others stayed behind in Russia to continue the exporting of Whale Oil. The family immigrated through the port of Bremen, Germany, where their name was changed from \\"Chernofski\\", which had at its root the Russian word for black, to \\"Schwartz\\", the German word for black. The family traveled to London, England during the early part of 1895 to strengthen contacts they had previously made with the Royal Court of Queen Victoria that would serve them later with Paragon Oil. According to old family documents, the majority of the family finally traveled to America during late 1895 as First Class passengers on the White Star liner Teutonic. Several of the five brothers' first cousins, including the sons of Sam's youngest sibling Barney Schwartz and the sons one of Lena's cousins, also joined the operation. However, some of them chose to adopt different surnames in the workplace, including the surnames \\"Harvey\\" and \\"Lawrence\\", so that it would not be immediately obvious that most of the people working in the upper levels of the company had the last name Schwartz, and thus were related. Avoiding public anti-Semitism was also a contributing factor to the cousins' surname changes; indeed, even some of the five brothers' first names were different than those on their birth certificates and early census records, changed to sound less overtly Jewish. For example, Arnold's real first name was Abraham, and the brother whose birth certificate showed \\"Benny\\" Schwartz officially went by the more genteel \\"B. Davis\\" Schwartz for most of his later adult life.  Founders' deaths  Henry Schwartz died in January 1983, Irving died in April 1974, Robert died in November 1971, Ben died in July 1969, and Arnold died in September 1979. Bess Schwartz Levy died around 1958. Their parents Sam and Lena Schwartz died in 1928 and 1941, respectively. The last of the original family members to work at Paragon Oil died in 2009. He was nonagenarian Jack Lawrence (n√©e Jacob Schwartz), a well-known songwriter and former president of ASCAP, and the son of Sam's youngest sibling Barney.

It is located within Royal Park in Parkville, approximately north of the centre of Melbourne. It is the primary zoo serving Melbourne. The zoo contains more than 320 animal species from Australia and around the world, and is accessible via Royal Park station on the Upfield railway line, and is also accessible via tram routes 58 and 19, as well as by bicycle on the Capital City Trail. Bicycles are not allowed inside the zoo itself. The Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens is a full institutional member of the Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA) and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). History Melbourne Zoo is Australia's oldest zoo and was modelled on London Zoo. The zoo was opened on 6 October 1862 at the Royal Park site of on land donated by the City of Melbourne. Before this, animals were housed at the botanical gardens in Melbourne. Initially the zoo was important for the acclimatisation of domestic animals recovering from their long trip to Australia. It was only with the appointment of Albert Alexander Cochrane Le Souef in 1870 that more exotic animals were procured for public display, and the gardens and picnic areas were developed. The President of the Zoological Board, feeding a llama in 1937 Royal Park railway station Visitors can see historical cages including the heritage listed Elephant House, which has been renovated and adapted for use for customers paying to sleep overnight in tents at the zoo in popular Roar and Snore evenings. These evenings allow the public to see some of the nocturnal animals at the zoo in evening guided tours by experienced camp hosts. One of the most famous exhibits was Queenie the elephant. The zoo is set among flower gardens and picnic areas. Many of the animals are now organised in bioclimatic zones: African rainforest featuring gorillas, mandrills, pigmy hippos and parrots; Asian Rainforest with tigers and otters; and the Australian bush with koala, kangaroos, emu, echidnas and endangered hairy nose wombats. Popular exhibits also include the Butterfly House, the great flight aviary and the Trail of the Elephants. Melbourne Zoo most recently completed construction and opened their carnivores trail in early 2018. Melbourne Zoo aerial panorama The zoo includes a large schools section and caters to many school visitors annually, its immensely popular education program encourages young minds to conserve animals. The Zoos Victoria administers the Melbourne Zoo, as well as the Werribee Open Range Zoo which features herbivorous creatures in an open range setting; and Healesville Sanctuary on of bushland exhibiting Australian fauna. On 15 January 2010 Melbourne Zoo welcomed its first elephant calf, Mali. This is the second elephant calf born in Australia, the first being in Sydney in July 2009. Mali is the first female calf born in Australia and the first calf born via artificial insemination. Melbourne Zoo commemorated 150 years of operation in 2012 and this was celebrated in an Australian Zoos collector's edition of stamps released by Australia Post in September 2012.

The film stars Robert De Niro (who was also one of the film's producers), Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner and Teri Polo. It was followed by a sequel, Little Fockers, in 2010. Plot Two years after the events of the first film, Gaylord \\"Greg\\" Focker and his fianc√©e Pam Byrnes decide to introduce their parents to each other. They first fly to Oyster Bay, New York, to pick up Pam's father, retired CIA operative Jack Byrnes, her mother Dina and one-year-old nephew Little Jack. Rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to Miami to meet Greg's parents in his new RV. Once Greg, Pam, and the Byrneses arrive in Miami, they are greeted by Greg's eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie Focker, a lawyer-turned-stay-at-home-dad, and Greg's mother, Roz, who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. Concerned that Jack might be put off by the Fockers' lifestyle, Greg convinces his mother to pretend that she is a yoga instructor for the weekend. However, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. The meet gets off to a bad start when a chase between the Fockers' dog, Moses, and the Byrneses' cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV's toilet, forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses. Later, Bernie accidentally injures Jack's back during a game of touch football. Pam informs Greg that she is pregnant, and the two decide to keep it a secret until they are married. Jack again becomes suspicious of Greg's character when they are introduced to the Fockers' housekeeper, Isabel Villalobos. Bernie reveals that Greg lost his virginity to Isabel 15 years earlier. Isabel's 15-year-old son Jorge, who has never met his father and bears a striking resemblance to Greg, catches the attention of Jack. Meanwhile, Roz, Bernie and Dina realize Pam is pregnant, but promise not to tell Jack. Greg is left alone to babysit Little Jack, whom Jack has been raising via the Ferber method. Despite Jack's strict instructions to leave Little Jack to self-soothe, Greg is unable to stand listening to Little Jack's cries and attempts to cheer him up by hugging him and acting humorously, but inadvertently teaches him the word \\"asshole\\". Greg answers a brief phone call from Roz, and Little Jack is let out of the playpen by Jinx and he glues his hands to a bottle of rum. Jack resumes his spying on Greg and sends Greg and Jorge's hair samples for a DNA test, while inviting Jorge to Greg and Pam's engagement party in hopes of getting Greg to admit he is Jorge's father. At the engagement party, Jack, who assumes that Greg knows about Jorge and has deliberately been keeping him a secret from Pam, introduces him to Jorge. Later, when Greg denies knowing anything about Jorge, Jack still refuses to believe him and drugs him with a shot of truth serum. While giving a toast on stage, Greg uncontrollably blurts out that Pam is pregnant and that Jorge is his son before immediately losing consciousness. The next morning, Pam questions Greg about Jorge, and Greg promises that he knew nothing about him before the previous evening. Pam believes him, and is willing to work things out with him. Jack has reached his breaking point and demands that Pam and Dina leave with him. Dina refuses and reveals to everyone that Jack had drugged Greg. Everyone turns against Jack and inform him that they were all aware of Pam's pregnancy. A shocked and hurt Jack leaves with his grandson. Bernie and Greg pursue Jack, but are tasered and arrested by Officer Le Flore for speeding and refusing to remain in their car when pulled over. Meanwhile, Jack receives the results of the DNA test that determines Greg is not Jorge's father. When Jack sees Bernie and Greg being pulled over, he attempts to defend them, but Le Flore tasers and arrests him as well. In their cell, Greg, Jack, and Bernie are released by Judge Ira, a client of Roz. Before they leave, Greg asks that Jack and Bernie stop their feud. Jack admits that he made a mistake regarding Jorge and reveals his past career in the CIA to Bernie before apologizing for his actions. Greg and Pam are married that weekend by Pam's ex-fianc√©, Kevin, who is now an ordained interfaith minister. Cast Critical response Rotten Tomatoes reported that 39% of 162 sampled critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10.

The seismic refraction method utilizes the refraction of seismic waves by rock or soil layers to characterize the subsurface geologic conditions and geologic structure. Seismic refraction is exploited in engineering geology, geotechnical engineering and exploration geophysics. Seismic refraction traverses (seismic lines) are performed using an array of seismographs or geophones and an energy source. The methods depend on the fact that seismic waves have differing velocities in different types of soil or rock. The waves are refracted when they cross the boundary between different types (or conditions) of soil or rock. The methods enable the general soil types and the approximate depth to strata boundaries, or to bedrock, to be determined. P-wave refraction P-wave refraction evaluates the compression wave generated by the seismic source located at a known distance from the array. The wave is generated by vertically striking a striker plate with a sledgehammer, shooting a seismic shotgun into the ground, or detonating an explosive charge in the ground. Since the compression wave is the fastest of the seismic waves, it is sometimes referred to as the primary wave and is usually more-readily identifiable within the seismic recording as compared to the other seismic waves. S-wave refraction S-wave refraction evaluates the shear wave generated by the seismic source located at a known distance from the array. The wave is generated by horizontally striking an object on the ground surface to induce the shear wave. Since the shear wave is the second fastest wave, it is sometimes referred to as the secondary wave. When compared to the compression wave, the shear wave is approximately one-half (but may vary significantly from this estimate) the velocity depending on the medium.

It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Ch√©seaux around 1745 and independently discovered by John Bevis before 1750. The cluster is scattered over an area of the sky almost the size of the full moon and is located from Earth. The compact open cluster NGC 2158 lies directly southwest of M35. Leonard & Merritt (1989) computed the mass of M35 using a statistical technique based on proper motion velocities of its stars. The mass within the central 3.75 parsecs was found to be between 1600 and 3200 solar masses (95 percent confidence), consistent with the mass of a realistic stellar population within the same radius. Bouy et al. (2015) found a mass of around within the central . There are 305 candidate members with a probability of 95% or higher, and up to 4,349 with a 50% membership probability. The cluster metallicity is given by [Fe/H] = . Of 418 probable cluster members, Leiner et al. (2015) found 64 that have variable radial velocities and thus are binary star systems. Four probable cluster members are chemically peculiar stars, while HD 41995, which lies within the cluster area, shows emission lines. Hu et al. (2005) found 13 variable stars in the cluster field, although at least three are suspect as cluster members.

It was discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654, who described it as a nebulous patch. The cluster was independently re- discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749, then Charles Messier observed it in 1764 and added it to his catalogue. M36 is at a distance of about 1,330 pc (4,340 light years) away from Earth. The cluster is very similar to the Pleiades cluster (M45), and if it were the same distance from Earth it would be of similar magnitude. This cluster has an angular diameter of and a core radius of . It has a mass of roughly and a linear tidal radius of . Based upon photometry, the age of the cluster has been estimated by Wu et al. (2009) as 25.1 Myr and Myr by Bell et al. (2013). The luminosity of the stars that have not yet consumed their lithium implies an age of Myr, in good agreement these previous estimates. M36 includes ten stars with a visual magnitude brighter than 10, and 178 down to magnitude 14. 38 members display an infrared excess, with one being particularly high. There is one candidate B-type variable star, which is 9th magnitude. Map Map References External links * Messier 036 Messier 036 036 Messier 036 Perseus Arm ?

M37 was missed by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil when he rediscovered M36 and M38 in 1749. French astronomer Charles Messier independently rediscovered M37 in September 1764 but all three clusters were recorded by Hodierna. It is classified as Trumpler type I,1,r or I,2,r. M37 is located in the antipodal direction, opposite from the Galactic Center as seen from Earth. Estimates of its age range from 347 million to 550 million years. It has 1,500 times the mass of the Sun and contains over 500 identified stars, with roughly 150 stars brighter than magnitude 12.5. M37 has at least a dozen red giants and its hottest surviving main sequence star is of stellar classification B9 V. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term metallicity, is similar to, if not slightly higher than, the abundance in the Sun. At its estimated distance of around from Earth, the cluster's angular diameter of 24 arcminutes corresponds to a physical extent of about . The tidal radius of the cluster, where external gravitational perturbations begin to have a significant influence on the orbits of its member stars, is about .

Kuskovo () was the summer country house and estate of the Sheremetev family. Built in the mid-18th century, it was originally situated several miles to the east of Moscow but now is part of the East District of the city. It was one of the first great summer country estates of the Russian nobility, and one of the few near Moscow still preserved. Today the estate is the home of the Russian State Museum of Ceramics, and the park is a favourite place of recreation for Muscovites.Kuskovo is also the name of the village that grew up round the estate.  History  In the 17th century, Kuskovo became the property of Boris Petrovich Sheremetev (1652‚Äì1719), a Russian Field Marshal under Czar Peter the Great, who led the Russian Army in the victory over the Swedes at the Battle of Poltava (1707) in the Great Northern War. There was already a wooden church on the site, a house and several ponds.Pamyatniki Arkhitekturiy Moskviy, pg. 49 The palace was constructed by his son Petr Borisovich Sheremetev (1713‚Äì1788). Count Sheremetev was one of the richest men in Russia, close to the court and a patron of the arts. He built Kuskovo at approximately the same time that he built a city palace on the banks of the Fontanka River in St. Petersburg. When he decided to build a palace at Kuskovo, he ordered that it be larger and more beautiful than the estates of other nobles, and equal to any residence of the Czars.Elena Eritsyan, Guide to the State Museum of Ceramics and the 18th Century Kuskovo Estate,1996. Since it was less than a day's journey from the center of Moscow, it was not designed to accommodate overnight guests, nor for agriculture or any other practical purpose, but purely as a place for entertainment, ceremony and festivities.Pamyatniki Akhitekturiy Moskviy, pg. 49 Construction was carried out between the 1730s and the 1790s on a site of over . The earliest surviving structure is the Saviour church, on the site of the old wooden church, built in 1737-39 in a Petrine baroque style and decorated with marble statues. The neoclassical bell-tower was added later, in 1792. The Dutch House was constructed between 1749 and 1751 by architect Y.I. Kologrivov, who then enlarged the pond into a lake and laid out the park and canals.Pamyatniki Arkhitecturiy Moskviy, pg. 49 After the death of Kologrivov in 1754, the construction of the palace was begun by the young architect Fiodor I. Argunov, who had designed the grotto and the belvedere by the canal in the eastern part of the park. When Fiodor Argunov became occupied with the construction of the Sheremetev house on the Fontanka in St. Petersburg, the task of designing the palace was given to the famous Moscow architect Karl Blank.See Pamyatniki Arkhitecturiy Moskviy and Elena Eritsyan, Guide to the State Museum of Ceramics and the 18th Century Kuskovo Estate,1996. The construction of the house occupied the 1760s. The neoclassical facade, attributed to the French architect Charles de Wailly, was added in 1774 after the son of the owner returned from Paris 1773. The twenty- six rooms of the palace were designed for entertaining and impressing guests on state occasions. Count Sheremetev entertained in a grand style; his outdoor entertainments in the park attracted as many twenty-five thousand guests. Entertainments included his a famous theater and orchestra with serf actors.Boris Brodsky, \\"Les Tr√©sors artistiques de Moscou\\", pg. 136. The estate was visited by Empress Catherine II in 1775; an obelisk in the park marks the event. By the end of the 18th century, the estate went into a decline. It was badly damaged during the French invasion in 1812. In the 1830s, the serf theater was torn down. After the abolition of serfdom in 1861, parcels of land were divided up and rented out. In the 19th century much of the furniture was moved to the city residences of the Shermetevs in Moscow and St. Petersburg. After the 1917 Revolution, the estate was nationalized. In 1919 the palace was turned into a small museum of natural history. Ten years later it became the home of the state museum of porcelain, which had been founded in 1918-20 on Podossensky Street in Moscow. It housed the nationalized collections of Russian art collectors A. Morozov, L. Zoubalov, and Botkine. In 1932 it was renamed the State Museum of Ceramics.Brodsky, pg. 111.  The Palace of Kuskovo  The palace was designed in the new neoclassical style, then becoming popular for state buildings in St. Petersburg and Moscow. The exterior was made of wooden planks, which were plastered and painted in soft pastel colors. The palace looked out onto a court of honor, formed by the palace, the church and the large lake. The six-column portico at the front of the house was designed with a ramp so that carriages with as many as eight horses could come directly to the front door. When the carriage arrived, servants would rush out the front doors and hold the horses while the guests descended.Brodsky, 142 Inside the palace on the western end of the building, were twelve large state rooms, and two smaller ensembles of rooms for residential use. * The vestibule at the front entrance was walled with plaster painted to resemble marble, with vases in niches designed by Johannes Justus. *The Reception Room had both an ornate fireplace, typical for Western Europe, and an oven decorated with colored tiles, traditional in Eastern (including Russia) and Northern Europe, showing the two artistic traditions in Russia at the time. *The Tapestry Room was the second reception room. It was decorated with 17th-century Flemish tapestries depicting parks and gardens. Between the tapestries, the windows looked out onto the lake and garden of the estate. *The State Bedroom Though it has a bed, the state bedroom was never used as a bedroom, but rather as a formal reception room, to impress the guests with the owner's taste.Ertitsyan, pg. 5 *the Cabinet-Bureau was the personal office of the Count, decorated with Dutch style-oak paneling with carved picture motifs, in the style of Peter the Great. * Everyday Bedroom was designed for rest. It had a marble-faced fireplace with inserted paintings by French artists, and portraits of the Sheremetev family. *The Dancing Hall or hall of mirrors was the largest and most decorated room in the house, with a painted ceiling and mirror-covered walls in white and gold. *The Billiards Room features a large billiards table made in England in the 18th century. *The Dining Room The paintings and decoration of the dining room stressed the long history and glory of the Sheremetev family.  The Park of Kuskovo  The park of Kuskovo was created between 1750 and 1780 as a formal Garden √† la fran√ßaise, with large ornamental parterres of flowers, carefully trimmed hedges, and alleys which met at either right or diagonal angles, and were ornamented with statues, and lined with either rows of trees trimmed into spheres, large vases; orange trees; or myrtle trees trimmed into cones.Brodsky, pg. 137 Eight park alleys converge in a single point, where the circular Hermitage pavilion (1764‚Äì77) now stands. Count Sheremetev spent most of his time in the Hermitage, coming to the Palace only for formal occasions and holidays. In the 1770s, following the changing tastes of the period, a second park in the style of an English landscape garden, no longer existing, was created to the north of the French park. This park presented an idealized version of nature, with winding paths, tunnels of greenery, picturesque groves of trees, lawns, and pavilions. Only the Hermitage remains from this part of the park. The Grotto The grotto was constructed between 1755 and 1761 by the architect F. Argunov, and was intended to represent the palace of the King of the Seas. It was placed next to a large pond, which reflected its imposing facade and dome. Inside rows of niches were filled with statues of Venus, Diana, Ceres, Flore, Juno and Jupiter. The windows were covered with iron grills forged by serf artisans look like strands of seaweed. The interior space, under dome, is meant to be the throne room of Neptune, crusted with seashells (1771-1775.) The grotto is one of the few 18th-century grottos still preserving its original decoration. The Dutch House A traditional brick Dutch house was constructed in the 1750s on a small pond near the Palace. the house has kitchen on the ground floor decorated from floor to ceiling with tiles from Delft. Meals were served to guests in the kitchen, though they were actually prepared at another kitchen in the woods nearby and carried by servants to the house. The upper floor is furnished with simple, solid Dutch furniture and highly decorated with Delft tiles.  The Orangerie  The orangerie (1761‚Äì1764) was designed by F. Argounov. It was not used as orangerie- the lemons, oranges and pineapples served the guests at Kuskovo were actually grown in greenhouses outside the park. Rather, it was used as a large banquet hall for guests. In the 1960s, it was turned into an exhibit hall for the collections of porcelain. This palace houses the most precious collection of Western porcelain in Eastern Europe, which had been collected by several generations of the Sheremetev family. In 1919 the palace was nationalized, and it was declared the State Museum of Ceramics twenty years later.  The State Museum of Ceramics  The museum in the Orangerie contains collections of fine porcelain assembled by Russian merchants and Empress Maria Fedorovna before the Russian Revolution. The major sections are: *German porcelain of the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly from the royal porcelain works at Meissen *English porcelain from Chelsea and Josiah Wedgwood. *French porcelain from the 18th century from manufacture royale of S√®vres. One highlight of the collection is the Egyptian service, commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798 to commemorate his Egyptian campaign, and presented by Napoleon to Czar Alexander I at the Tilsit Conference in 1807. *Danish porcelain of the 18th and 19th century. *Russian and Soviet porcelain of the 18th, 19th and 20th century. The collection of porcelain on revolutionary themes from the early Soviet period is particularly notable.Brodsky, pg. 148-167 Gallery Image:kuskovo 1839.jpg View of Kuskovo in 1839 File:Moscow Kuskovo Park asv2018-08 img1.jpgGeneral view File:Grotto in Kuskovo 2014 (1).JPGGrotto File:–ö—É—Å–∫–æ–≤–æ 63.jpgView of the Orangerie File:–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ - –ö—É—Å–∫–æ–≤–æ, –≠—Ä–º–∏—Ç–∞–∂.jpgHermitage File:Kuskovo aerial view-1.jpgAerial view of Kuskovo in 2008 File:–ü–∞—Ä–∫ —Å–æ —Å–∫—É–ª—å–ø—Ç—É—Ä–æ–π 1.jpgPark Image:kuskovo.jpgView of Kuskovo in 1999 Image:kuskovopalace.jpgSheremetev Palace in Kuskovo.

Archived version Today, it remains among the largest street newspapers in the nation. StreetWise contains art, poetry, and articles by vendors; as well as stories of local, but nothing about homelessness.  History  StreetWise Headquarters on Lake Street In 1991 a group of Chicago business people joined the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless to address the growing problem of street homelessness. In 1992, Judd Lofchie created StreetWise. About 200 vendors sell approximately 20,000 magazines weekly. The vendors buy the magazine for 90 cents each and sell for $2, keeping the profit. StreetWise was headquartered at 1331 S. Michigan Ave until 2005. It relocated to its 1201 W. Lake St. headquarters until 2011 when it moved to its current headquarters at 4554 N. Broadway in Chicago. Over time, the magazine has fallen victim to a slow economy. Foundation support had made up nearly half of StreetWise's $500,000 budget but is down 60 percent as of 2012. Ad revenues also are in decline and street sales have dropped 20 percent. After publishers and board members announced on April 15, 2009 that declining revenues and foundation support might force a closure with 45 days, donations began pouring in. Before the end of the day, an influx of almost $41,000 helped the ailing publication halfway to its goal. Within a week, over $190,000 in donations were made, far exceeding the needed $75,000 to keep afloat. During a February 2009 meeting, StreetWise's board of directors decided to fire Executive Director Michael Speer and began to discuss potential replacements. Bruce Crane was promoted to turn the company around. Crane reduced operation costs and increased ad sales. The organization went from $200,000 in debt to posting a net income of $1,168 last year under Crane. Jim LoBianco, the former Commissioner for the Office of Homeless Services in Chicago, succeeded Bruce Crane as the magazine‚Äôs executive director on January 1, 2011. In 2008, the format changed from the original tabloid-style newspaper to a magazine publication and that's where the trouble began. This change was intended to increase readership and advertisement revenue, but instead it was heavy to carry and vendors couldn't afford to or desired to make multiple trips to the office to get magazines to sell. In 2012, StreetWise began collaborating with The Night Ministry. The objective is to increase the assistance StreetWise provides to Chicago's most vulnerable individuals. StreetWise also launched the Neighbor Carts program. StreetWise vendors will sell fresh produce on Chicago streets as a part of this program. That effort was very short lived.

The studio closed permanently on April 30, 2005. History In November 1988, Nickelodeon joined the Universal Studios Florida team to make its first production studio. In spring 1989, they filmed its first show there, Super Sloppy Double Dare. On June 7, 1990, the studio (along with the park) officially opened. There was a 3 hour opening day ceremony party broadcast live on Nickelodeon, with Marc Summers as the master of ceremonies for the event that day. Other hosts included Greg Lee and Skip Lackey. The ceremony also included performances by The Perfect Gentlemen, Kid 'n Play, and The Cover Girls, a behind the scenes look at the studio, an inside look at the Universal Studios theme park, and a short round of a physical challenge from Double Dare. The same year Nickelodeon unveiled its Slime Geyser on October 27, 1990. On April 30, 1992, a time capsule was buried to commemorate the studio's opening. A special capsule burial ceremony was broadcast live on Nickelodeon and was hosted by Mike O'Malley and Joey Lawrence. The facility was a working studio where many Nickelodeon and Nickelodeon GAS shows were produced, the first being Double Dare. It consisted of soundstages 18 and 19, along with a central building between them that housed both Nickelodeon production offices, dressing rooms, makeup rooms, the Gak Kitchen, and the Game Lab live show located on Stage 17 for guests of Universal Studios Florida. Soundstage 21, located directly behind Stages 17 and 18, was also part of the production facility in the early 1990s when a larger soundstage was needed for the taping of Nickelodeon/Global Guts. Stage 21 was not part of the studio contract Nickelodeon had with Universal, but was leased separately for the time of their productions on it. While Nickelodeon Studios was in production, there were many orange benches scattered around the facility, incorporating shapes like a footprint, carrot, finger, cruise ship, wave, cloud, etc., reflecting the network's station IDs. Some of these benches were moved to the \\"Control Room\\" at Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast, which closed in 2011. A gift shop was also located near the Slime Geyser, featuring Nickelodeon characters on the front of the building. =Decline and closure= In 1997 and 1998, Nickelodeon opened two new studios in California, the live action studio Nickelodeon on Sunset, and the Nickelodeon Animation Studio. Nickelodeon shifted away from live-action shows towards focusing on animation reducing the need for a television studio. In 1999, besides Figure It Out's final season and other shows that aired, no new shows were made and filmed at the Orlando location. By the summer of 2001, Nickelodeon Studios had fewer than 100 employees, and began to see a steady decline in visitors as Nickelodeon's live-action productions began to transition from game and stunt shows with audience participation to traditional sitcoms, many of which required closed-set production. The majority of Nickelodeon production had moved to the closed-set Nickelodeon on Sunset facility in Hollywood, California. In late 2004, the studio got its new paint job. The final program taped was Nickelodeon Splat!, which ran live from March 7, 2004 to August 17, 2004. The studio closed its doors on April 30, 2005. This was a result of Nickelodeon gradually moving its administration to the MTV Networks headquarters in Santa Monica, California and One Astor Plaza in New York City and its live-action production arm to the Nickelodeon on Sunset. A time capsule buried by the network in 1992 in front of Soundstage 18 was removed in August 2007 and later paved over. It contains items deemed important to the children of 1992 as voted upon by Nickelodeon viewers, including bubble gum, a skateboard, a comic book, a phone book, VHS copies of Back to the Future and Home Alone, assorted photographs of bicycles, trains, cars, politicians, and celebrities, a piece of the Berlin Wall, the Orlando, Florida TV Guide from the week of April 30, 1992, a baseball, a Barbie Doll, a Nintendo Game Boy, a Nicktoons T-shirt, Michael Jackson CDs, Twinkies, an issue of Nickelodeon Magazine, Rollerblades, a can of Nickelodeon Gak, Reebok Pump sneakers, and a copy of the Book of Endangered species. The time capsule resided at the Nickelodeon Suites Resort (now the Holiday Inn Resort Orlando Suites - Waterpark) after the studio closed; upon the hotel's closure and rebrand in 2016, it moved west to its current location in the new five-story glass building at the Nickelodeon Animation Studio in Burbank, California, where it is set to be opened on April 30, 2042 (exactly 50 years after being buried at Nickelodeon Studios). At this time, Stage 19, as well as the second floor control room in the center building between it and 18, is home to Fox Sports Florida and its sister network, Fox Sports Sun. It is also being used as a storage area for Universal Orlando parade floats, and to train sporting events for My Family's Got Guts, which was a short-lived revival of the classic Nickelodeon game show Guts. The green room had been used as a one for the show, and has remained exactly the same as it did when earlier Nickelodeon productions used it, albeit with new furniture. Much of the Nickelodeon signage was still visible in the second floor hallways including multiple murals of the Ren and Stimpy episode: Space Madness (now removed). Currently, the tube that runs above Soundstage 19 that was part of the tour, is now used for storage of several old props and A/V equipment, along with storage for the Blue Man Group. Additionally, the Gak Kitchen is used as the break room for the front of their house staff and the space that formerly housed the Game Lab is now a special event room for them and the park itself. =Remnants= On November 9, 2006, Universal Orlando announced that Soundstage 18 would be redesigned to become a 1,000-seat permanent venue for the Blue Man Group. The new venue opened on June 1, 2007. During the construction phase of the new theater, no cosmetic changes were made, with the exception of the addition of the new box office in the pavilion. The sound stage was painted black with three giant blue heads, the main building was painted white with black and blue trim, and the side of Stage 18 was painted black with blue, yellow, and red paint splats. The facility was renamed the Sharp Aquos Theatre. In 2008, Nickelodeon returned for the only time to Universal Studios with My Family's Got Guts. Training was in Soundstage 19, and breaks were in the Green Room, while actual production was in Soundstage 23 with the Aggro Crag in Soundstage 24. In 2012, YouTube personality adamthewoo gained access into Soundstage 19 and the upper floors of the main building; he documented vastly untouched murals and decor from the heyday of the studios. In April 2013, leftover orange railing on the main building was repainted blue after six years since the opening of the studios as the Sharp Aquos Theater. In March 2014, the \\"Production Crew Only\\" orange Nickelodeon splat-shaped sticker was removed from the exterior door (formerly the exit from the Game Lab) and replaced by a Blue Man Group-themed \\"Team Members Only\\" sticker. As of 2019, no vestiges of the studio remain. The first floor of the main building has been completely changed with the escalators and The Wild Thornberrys murals completely removed. Additionally, the second floor walls (which contained various spaceship-themed murals from The Ren & Stimpy Show) were completely repainted, and leftover green paint on the left exterior wall backstage was repainted yellow to match the colors of the soundstage. The only remaining signs of Nickelodeon's former presence include the bathrooms underneath the staircase which contain the green slime-themed flooring pattern, two slime spills by the exterior staircase and bathrooms (albeit painted blue), and the elevator door by the former Game Lab exit.

Originally, the diver insignia was a cloth patch decoration worn by United States Navy divers in the upper- portion of the enlisted service uniform's left sleeve during the first part of World War II, when the rating insignia was worn on the right sleeve. When enlisted rating insignia were shifted to the left sleeve in late World War II, the patch shifted to the upper right sleeve. The diving patch was created during World War II, and became a breast insignia in the late 1960s. Currently, the United States Navy and the United States Army issue diver insignia and badges denoting degrees of qualification. The United States Coast Guard and United States Marine Corps personnel are eligible to earn most of the naval diver insignia. United States naval services United States naval diver insignia are awarded, per degree of qualification, to sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen. The elementary naval diver insignia is the Scuba Diver Insignia, awarded upon qualifying as a basic naval diver. Previously, the Scuba Diver Insignia was awarded in two degrees, one for officers and one for enlisted. The Navy eliminated the Scuba Diver Officer insignia in the 1990s, but it remains in service within the Coast Guard. The silver-colored insignia features an old-fashioned diving mask and open-circuit breathing apparatus.U.S. Coast Guard Uniform Regulation, COMDTINST M1020.6F, United States Coast Guard, dated March 2012, last accessed 14 July 2012 In 2001, the Marine Corps authorized the creation of a new badge, the Combatant Diver Insignia, attesting to the wearer's closed-circuit rebreather and reconnaissance combat diver training; the gold-colored combatant diver insignia depicts a wetsuit hood, low-profile diving mask, and chest-mounted rebreather. The naval deep sea diver qualification insignia are awarded in four degrees: second-class diver; first-class diver; master diver; and diving officer. However, the Marine Corps does not award the Diving Officer Insignia to its officers. In the Navy, the master diver is the most qualified diver; he must be a chief petty officer before applying to attend the master diver course.U.S. Marine Corps Uniform Regulation MCO P1020.34G, Chapter 4 , United States Marine Corps, last updated 29 October 2009, last accessed 14 July 2012 The Diving Medical Officer Insignia and the Diving Medical Technician Insignia are awarded to naval medical personnel qualified as divers or medical technicians, respectively. The Diving Medical Insignia resembles the Master Diver Insignia, but is decorated with a caduceus. The Diving Medical Officer Insignia is gold in color while the enlisted version‚Äîthe Diving Medical Technician Insignia‚Äîis silver in color. Since the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard have no organic medical officers, they do not issue the Diving Medical Officer Insignia. However, like all medicine, the Marine Corps is served by US Navy Diving Medical Officers and Diving Medical Technicians. The Diving Medical Officers attend their own training course that often has Air Force, Army, and foreign doctors all who, upon completion, wear the Navy Diving Medical Officer insignia. The enlisted Diving Medical Technicians attend the same course as Navy divers training to become second-class divers, but with slight changes to the curriculum for medicine. They enter that class having already trained as Navy hospital corpsmen. Like the Navy's surface, submarine, and aviation enlisted specialties, dive-qualified enlisted personnel place a term after the sailor's rating; for example, if Petty Officer Second-Class Jones is dive-qualified, he is referred to, in writing, as PO2 (DV) Jones. The only non-armed service of the United States that awards diver badges is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps (NOAA Corps). NOAA Corps officers qualified as NOAA divers may wear the NOAA Diver Insignia after authorization by the Director of the NOAA Corps. The NOAA Diver Insignia is a gold-colored pin consisting of a NOAA Corps device surrounded by two dolphins.NOAA Corps Commissioned Personnel Center, NOAA Corps Directives, NOAA Corps, last accessed 13 Nov 11 United States Army The United States Army issues two different types of diver badges, one for Army engineer divers and one for Army special operations divers. Army engineer diver badges are awarded in four degrees (second-class diver, salvage diver, first-class diver, and master diver) while Army special operations diver badges are awarded in two degrees (diver and diving supervisor). The second-class and first-class diver badges are identical to those issued by U.S. naval forces. The Army does not issue officer or medical diver badges; however, Navy-awarded Diving Officer Insignia, Diving Medical Officer Insignia, and Diving Medical Technician Insignia are authorized for wear on Army uniforms with written approval from the United States Army Human Resources Command.U.S. Army Regulation 670‚Äì1, Uniforms and Insignia, Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia , Department of the Army, dated 3 February 2005, rapid action revision dated 11 May 2012, last accessed 14 July 2012Army Regulation 600-8-22 Military Awards (24 June 2013).

Prior to this change, the Scuba Diver Insignia/Badge was the same for all of the U.S. armed forces. The new design includes sharks, symbolizing speed, stealth, and lethal efficiency, and two Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knives in saltire, representing the heritage of OSS operational swimmers during World War II.

He was the first of the Walker baronets of Pembroke House. Career He was born at Gore Port, Finea, County Westmeath, a younger son of Captain Alexander Walker and his wife Elizabeth Elliott. He was educated at Portarlington School and Trinity College, Dublin. He entered Gray's Inn before being called to the bar in 1855. He quickly became one of the leaders of the Irish Chancery bar: in 1872 he was made a Queen's Counsel, and eleven years later he became Ireland's Solicitor General. The following year, he was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Londonderry, a seat he held for little more than a year before the constituency was divided, and in 1885 he was also for a period the island's Attorney-General. His celebrated remark that on entering the House of Commons \\"he was amazed to hear Members making factual statements without sworn affidavits to support them\\" was probably a joke. He himself rarely spoke in the House, but his rare speeches were enliverend by a dry wit. An advocate for Home Rule, Walker remained within the Liberal Party after its split, and was eventually appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland when Gladstone returned to power in 1892. When Lord Rosebery's ministry fell three years later, he was made a Lord Justice of Appeal, and remained in this capacity until his reappointment as Lord Chancellor by the Liberal government in 1905. He lived at Pembroke Hall, Upper Mount Street in Dublin city. He was created a baronet the following year, and died rather suddenly, while still in office, at his Dublin house Pembroke Hall in 1911. He is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, beside his first wife Cecilia and his daughter Alice. Character and reputation He was a lawyer of great ability, and went on to become one of a remarkable group of Irish judges, which included Christopher Palles, Hugh Holmes, and Gerald FitzGibbon, who gave the Irish Court of Appeal, in the years 1890‚Äì1910, a reputation for judicial eminence which has never been equalled by any other Irish Court, and could bear comparison with any equivalent English court. Maurice Healy praised him as \\"a loyal friend and a man of courage\\" but thought that these qualities sometimes led him into acts of political recklessness. His insistence on appointing Matthias Bodkin, a leading journalist and a staunch political ally, to a County Court judgeship, was a serious political blunder. Although Bodkin was a qualified barrister, legitimate doubts had been raised by Walker's political opponents as to whether he had the necessary years of practice to qualify for appointment to the Bench. The result was an action for quo warranto challenging the validity of Bodkin's appointment, which gravely embarrassed the Government, although no harm ultimately came of it: the case was resolved amicably and Bodkin, by general agreement, proved to be an excellent judge. Family He married firstly in 1855 Cecilia Charlotte Greene, daughter of Arthur Greene and a niece of the eminent judge Richard Wilson Greene, with whom he had six children, including Alexander, the second baronet, and Alice, who died in 1949. Cecilia died in 1880. He married secondly in 1881 Eleanor McLaughlin, with whom he had two more children, including Cecil, who succeeded his half- brother Alexander as third baronet. Samuel's elder brother was General Sir Mark Walker VC KCB.  References  *Ball, F.

In the 1970s it replaced the original T1/D1 framing scheme of the 1960s in which the framing bit simply alternated between 0 and 1. Superframe is sometimes called D4 Framing to avoid confusion with single-frequency signaling. It was first supported by the D2 channel bank, but it was first widely deployed with the D4 channel bank. In order to determine where each channel is located in the stream of data being received, each set of 24 channels is aligned in a frame. The frame is 192 bits long (8 * 24), and is terminated with a 193rd bit, the framing bit, which is used to find the end of the frame. In order for the framing bit to be located by receiving equipment, a predictable pattern is sent on this bit. Equipment will search for a bit which has the correct pattern, and will align its framing based on that bit. The pattern sent is 12 bits long, so every group of 12 frames is called a superframe.

More specifically, after the 6th and 12th bit in the superframe pattern, the least significant data bit of each channel (bit 8; T1 data is sent big-endian and uses 1-origin numbering) is replaced by a \\"channel-associated signalling\\" bit (bits A and B, respectively). Superframe remained in service in many places through the turn of the century, replaced by the improved extended superframe (ESF) of the 1980s in applications where its additional features were desired.

WNC 4 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764 while he was searching for a nebula that had been reported in the area by Johannes Hevelius. Not seeing any nebulae, Messier catalogued this double star instead. It was subsequently rediscovered by Friedrich August Theodor Winnecke in 1863, and included in the Winnecke Catalogue of Double Stars as number 4. Burnham calls M40 \\"one of the few real mistakes in the Messier catalog,\\" faulting Messier for including it when all he saw was a double star, not a nebula of any sort. In 1991 the separation between the components was measured at 51.7\\", an increase since Messier's time. Data gathered by astronomers Brian Skiff (2001) and Richard L. Nugent (2002) strongly suggested that this was merely an optical double star rather than a physically connected system. In 2016, parallax measurements from the Gaia satellite showed that the two stars involved (HD 238107 and HD 238108) are unrelated, confirming the previous suggestion by Skiff and Nugent. As measured by Gaia, the two stars are 350¬±30 pc and 140¬±5 pc distant, so one is over twice as far as the other.

The district encompasses wealthy enclaves such as the Hamptons, middle-class suburban towns such as Selden, Centereach and Lake Grove, working-class neighborhoods such as Mastic and Riverhead, and rural farming communities such as Mattituck and Jamesport on the North Fork. Early life, education and career Bishop is a twelfth-generation resident of Southampton, New York, where he was born on June 1, 1950. He is the son of Catherine (Roesel) and Howard Cortland Bishop. He is the great-grandson of Benjamin H. Bishop, a mayor of Southampton, and has English, Irish, and German ancestry. He received a bachelor's degree in History from The College of the Holy Cross and a master's degree in Public Administration from Long Island University. Bishop served as Provost of Southampton College for 16 years, where he began working in 1973 as an admissions counselor. In his nearly 29 years at LIU's Southampton College, Bishop served in positions touching almost every aspect of college life, from institutional research and planning, financial aid, and enrollment services, to student activities, personnel, community relations, and fund raising. He served as director of financial aid, assistant director of admissions, registrar, director of institutional research and planning, dean for enrollment services, and dean for administrative and student services. In 1986, Bishop was appointed Provost of Southampton College. In this position, Bishop served as the chief executive officer in charge of the day-to-day management of the entire campus. Known as a strong and capable administrator, Congressman Bishop worked effectively with the college's diverse constituencies including students, alumni, staff, faculty, University officers, board members, government officials and community residents. During his tenure, several academic programs achieved national prominence. Southampton College of Long Island University produced 36 Fulbright Scholars, a remarkable achievement for a small college. As provost, Bishop developed the award-winning Cooperative Education and Freshman Programs, an integral part of the LIU Plan implemented across the University. Bishop negotiated the licensing agreement to power up the University's flagship radio station WPBX-88.3 FM ‚Äî the only Long Island-based NPR affiliate ‚Äî to 25,000 Watts. During his tenure, four new graduate programs were added to the curriculum, and a new academic center, Chancellors Hall, was built. Along with the Southampton College Chancellor, Robert F.X. Sillerman, Bishop developed the most successful single fund-raising event in the college's history, the All for the Sea rock concerts which grossed as much as $1 million annually. Congressional tenure Rep. Tim Bishop speaking at a podium Bishop supported and voted for the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Bishop also voted for the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (TARP), and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (also known as the \\"stimulus bill\\"), and for further measures in 2009 and 2010. He also voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011, which provided for further gradual increments in the debt limit. Bishop participated in the bipartisan coalition of elected officials and community advocates that saved the 106th Air Rescue Wing located at Gabreski Airport from being shut down by the Pentagon's base closure commission. In opposition to a plan that would have dumped more than twenty million cubic yards of contaminated dredge waste in the Long Island Sound, Bishop sponsored legislation to block the plan. In January 2007, he voted for a reduction of interest rates on future federal student loans. Bishop supported the Shinnecock Indian tribe's successful attempts at gaining formal federal recognition. Bishop supported a $160,000 line-item for the Shinnecock Nation in President Obama's 2013 budget proposal. =Committee assignments= *Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Workforce Protections Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training *Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee on Water Resources and the Environment (Ranking Member) Subcommittee on Highways and Transit =Caucus memberships= * National Archives Caucus, Co-Chair * Democratic Budget Group, Co-Chair * Coalition for Autism Research and Education (CARE) * Community College Caucus * Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues * Congressional Arts Caucus * Congressional Caucus on Addiction, Treatment and Recovery * Congressional Civility Caucus * Congressional Humanities Caucus * Congressional Labor and Working Families Caucus * Congressional Long Island Sound Caucus * Congressional Military Family Caucus * Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus * Congressional Sri Lanka Caucus * Congressional Wine Caucus * House Cancer Caucus * House Democratic Caucus * House Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus * House National Service Caucus * Sudan Caucus * Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition * United Services Organization (USO) Congressional Caucus =Ethics investigation= In September 2013, the Office of Congressional Ethics recommended further review of an August 2012 incident in which Bishop was accused of soliciting a campaign contribution from hedge fund magnate Eric Semler in exchange for acting in an official capacity to obtain a fireworks permit for Semler's son's bar mitzvah on Long Island. Bishop denied the allegations as \\"outrageous, unfounded attacks on my character and my family\\". After the incident was picked up by the media, Semler called the allegations a \\"nonstory\\". The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the incident. In September 2014, the Justice Department closed its investigation without filing charges. Political campaigns ;2002 In his first political race, Bishop ran as a Democrat against Republican Incumbent Felix J. Grucci, Jr. During the campaign, Grucci ran radio ads accusing Bishop of falsifying rape statistics at Southampton College, but his claims were based on articles from a college newspaper that contained numerous inaccuracies. Grucci refused to repudiate the ads, and was defeated by Bishop. ;2004 Incumbent Bishop beat Republican candidate William M. Manger, Jr. 56.2%-43.8% ;2006 Incumbent Bishop beat Republican candidate Italo Zanzi 62.2%-37.8% ;2008 Incumbent Bishop defeated Republican candidate Lee Zeldin 58%-42% and was re-elected. ;2010 Bishop narrowly defeated Republican Randy Altschuler by a margin of 50.2% to 49.8% after Altschuler conceded the race when trailing by 263 votes. ;2012 Bishop again defeated Republican Randy Altschuler by a 52.2%-47.8% margin. Although Bishop received the Independence Party endorsement in most of his previous elections, in 2012 the endorsement went instead to his opponent. ;2014 Bishop ran unopposed for the Democratic, Working Families and Independence Party nominations. He was a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Frontline Program, a program designed to help protect vulnerable Democratic incumbents heading into the 2014 election. He faced Republican nominee Lee Zeldin in the general election. On November 4, 2014, Bishop lost his re-election bid to Zeldin 55% to 45%. Post-Congressional career After leaving Congress, Bishop joined St. Joseph's College as a distinguished professor of Civic Engagement and Public Service. Among Bishop's many responsibilities at the College he will be afforded the opportunity to continue his lifelong work of providing access to Higher Education to traditional underserved populations. Bishop is a senior advisor to a Washington, D.C.-based government relations firm. Bishop has accepted positions on the Board of Directors of Social Accountability International and The Sergeant Sullivan Center. Both commitments allow Bishop to continue on two of his top priorities in the Congress ‚Äî working to ensure workplace protections and services to U.S. veterans, particularly in the area of post deployment health. On March 20, 2018, Bishop was confirmed by the Suffolk County Legislature to a five-year term on the Suffolk County Water Authority (SCWA).

It is one of the nearest open clusters to Earth, containing a larger population of stars than other nearby bright open clusters. Under dark skies, the Beehive Cluster looks like a small nebulous object to the naked eye; as known since ancient times. Classical astronomer Ptolemy described it as \\"nebulous mass in the breast of Cancer\\", and it was among the first objects that Galileo studied with his telescope. Age and proper motion coincide with those of the Hyades, suggesting they may share similar origins. Both clusters also contain red giants and white dwarfs, which represent later stages of stellar evolution, along with many main sequence stars. Distance to M44 is often cited to be between 160 and 187 parsecs (520‚Äì610 light years), WEBDA but the revised Hipparcos parallaxes (2009) for Praesepe members and the latest infrared color-magnitude diagram favors an analogous distance of 182 pc.van Leeuwen, F. \\"Parallaxes and proper motions for 20 open clusters as based on the new Hipparcos catalogue\\", A&A;, 2009Majaess, D.; Turner, D.; Lane, D.; Krajci, T. \\"Deep Infrared ZAMS Fits to Benchmark Open Clusters Hosting delta Scuti Stars\\", Journal of the American Association of Variable Star Observers, 2011 There are better age estimates of around 600 million years, equivalent to about 625 million years, for the Hyades. The diameter of the bright inner cluster core is about 7.0 parsecs (23 light years). Observationally, the Beehive is easily visible to the naked eye as a small nebulous cloud when Cancer culminates in the early evening sky each year from February to May. At 1.5¬∞ across, the cluster easily fits within the field of view of binoculars or low-powered small telescopes.  History  In 1609, Galileo first telescopically observed the Beehive and was able to resolve it into 40 stars. Charles Messier added it to his famous catalog in 1769 after precisely measuring its position in the sky. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Pleiades cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Beehive has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets. Another possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalog than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalog contained 42 objects, and so he added some well-known bright objects to boost his list. Wilhelm Schur, as director of the G√∂ttingen Observatory, drew a map of the cluster in 1894.Wilhelm Schur's map of the Beehive Cluster in 1894 Ancient Greeks and Romans saw this object as a manger from which two donkeys, the adjacent stars Asellus Borealis and Asellus Australis, are eating; these are the donkeys that Dionysos and Silenus rode into battle against the Titans. Hipparchus (c.130 BC) refers to the cluster as Nephelion (\\"Little Cloud\\") in his star catalog. Claudius Ptolemy's Almagest includes the Beehive Cluster as one of seven \\"nebulae\\" (four of which are real), describing it as \\"The Nebulous Mass in the Breast (of Cancer)\\". Aratus (c.260‚Äì270 BC) calls the cluster Achlus or \\"Little Mist\\" in his poem Phainomaina. This perceived nebulous object is in the Ghost (Gui Xiu), the 23rd lunar mansion of ancient Chinese astrology. Ancient Chinese skywatchers saw this as a ghost or demon riding in a carriage and likened its appearance to a \\"cloud of pollen blown from willow catkins\\". It was also known by the somewhat less romantic name of Jishi qi (Á©çÂ±çÊ∞£, also transliterated Tseih She Ke), the \\"Exhalation of Piled-up Corpses\\". It is also known simply as Jishi (Á©çÂ±ç), \\"cumulative corpses\\".  Morphology and composition  Like many star clusters of all kinds, Praesepe has experienced mass segregation. This means that bright massive stars are concentrated in the cluster's core, while dimmer and less massive stars populate its halo (sometimes called the corona). The cluster's core radius is estimated at 3.5 parsecs (11.4 light years); its half-mass radius is about 3.9 parsecs (12.7 light years); and its tidal radius is about 12 parsecs (39 light years). However, the tidal radius also includes many stars that are merely \\"passing through\\" and not bona fide cluster members. Altogether, the cluster contains at least 1000 gravitationally bound stars, for a total mass of about 500‚Äì600 Solar masses. A recent survey counts 1010 high-probability members, of which 68% are M dwarfs, 30% are Sun-like stars of spectral classes F, G, and K, and about 2% are bright stars of spectral class A. Also present are five giant stars, four of which have spectral class K0 III and the fifth G0 III. So far, eleven white dwarfs have been identified, representing the final evolutionary phase of the cluster's most massive stars, which originally belonged to spectral type B. Brown dwarfs, however, are extremely rare in this cluster, probably because they have been lost by tidal stripping from the halo. The cluster has a visual brightness of magnitude 3.7. Its brightest stars are blue-white and of magnitude 6 to 6.5. 42 Cancri is a confirmed member. alt=  Planets  In September, 2012 two planets which orbit separate stars were discovered in the Beehive Cluster. The finding was significant for being the first planets detected orbiting stars like Earth's Sun that were situated in stellar clusters. Planets had previously been detected in such clusters, but not orbiting stars like the Sun. The planets have been designated Pr0201 b and Pr0211 b. The 'b' at the end of their names indicates that the bodies are planets. The discoveries are what have been termed Hot Jupiters, massive gas giants that, unlike the planet Jupiter, orbit very close to their parent stars. The announcement describing the planetary finds, written by Sam Quinn as the lead author, was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Quinn's team worked with David Latham of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, utilizing the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory. In 2016 additional observations concluded that in the Pr0211 system there are actually two planets, the second one being Pr0211 c.

Debt recovery controversy (aka 'robo-debt') In 2016, Centrelink began reconciling welfare recipients' records against data from the Australian Taxation Office. In a process that had previously seen 20,000 debt recovery letters issued per year, this new automated data-matching technique, with less human oversight, saw that number increase to 169,000 letters during July-Dec 2016. Opponents of the automated process - known colloquially as 'robo-debt' - say that errors in the system have led to welfare recipients paying nonexistent debts or debts that are larger than what they actually owe. Some welfare recipients have been required to make payments while contesting their debts. In some cases, the debts being pursued dated back further than the Australian Taxation Office requests that Australians retain their documentation. The onus was moved from Centrelink needing to verify the information, to being on the individual to prove they did not owe the funds, with human interaction being very limited in the dispatch of the debt letters. The process, however, was touted to save the government $300m, and as such was considered for recovery action against the Aged Pension and Disability Pension, which could have recovered . The program was the subject of a Senate committee inquiry. Appearing before the Senate committee inquiry, the Department was asked how many people had become deceased after receiving a letter under the debt recovery program. After the question was taken on notice, the Department was asked again in a subsequent inquiry hearing, and it was again taken on notice. The 2018 Australian federal budget indicated that the data matching scheme would be expanded further. The calculations used to estimate debt are being legally challenged by Legal Aid Victoria, who say that they assume that people are working regular, full-time hours when calculating income. In September 2019 Gordon Legal announced their intention of filing a class action suit challenging the legal foundations of the 'robo-debt' system. = Scrapped = On 29 May 2020, Stuart Robert, Minister for Government Services announced that the 'robo-debt' debt recovery scheme was to be scrapped by the Government, with 470,000 wrongly-issued debts to be repaid in full.

In a January 2003 press conference, NASCAR's chairman of the board, Bill France, Jr., caused a stir when he interrupted the conference to announce big changes for 2004. France said that many tracks were under fire and being looked at as having race dates taken from them, and given to other facilities. Among the scenarios being looked at by France were how tracks did with ticket sales, and how the weather affected those races. Two tracks immediately looked at by the media were the North Carolina Speedway and Darlington Raceway. Both tracks' events almost never sold out, and the weather, especially at the North Carolina Speedway, had been a major problem, as rain forced many races to be postponed until the next day, typically Monday, which caused attendance to be even worse. Realignment 2004 \\"Realignment 2004\\" was announced in June 2003 at the Winston Cup race weekend at the Michigan International Speedway. While there were only a few changes, they were major. In June 1997, Auto Club Speedway began hosting a Winston Cup race. The track is located in Fontana, California, just outside Los Angeles, and so many fans flocked to the first race, and very quickly, the Los Angeles area became NASCAR's largest market. So, it was announced that Darlington's Mountain Dew Southern 500, held on Labor Day weekend for 54 years, would be moved to November for 2004, alienating the fan base of long time NASCAR fans. In the process, Rockingham's November date, the Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400, would move to Fontana, become the Pop Secret 500, and be run from the late evening into the night on the West Coast on the day before Labor Day, while also being shown live on NBC in primetime. The move of the race to September left Rockingham with just one race to run in 2004‚Äîits February date, the Subway 400. Realignment 2005 \\"Realignment 2004\\" was unpopular with many, but unlike \\"realignment 2005\\", the previous realignment in the schedule was not tied in with a lawsuit. In April 1997 the Winston Cup Series began racing at the newly built Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth. Bruton Smith's Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (which also oversees operations of tracks in Bristol, Tennessee, Hampton, Georgia, Loudon, New Hampshire, and Concord, North Carolina, all of which have two race dates a year) thought that the first race at Texas was popular enough to warrant another date. Soon, the company began pressing NASCAR to give them another date, but NASCAR refused to grant the track a second race. Early in the 2000s, SMI shareholder Francis Ferko filed a lawsuit against NASCAR, saying that it failed to come through on a promise to give Texas a second date. NASCAR denied making any promise of any kind. (Ferko filed the suit on his own; Smith did not want any part of the it.) In May 2004, NASCAR announced that they and Texas Speedway had reached a settlement. As part of the settlement ISC sold North Carolina Speedway to SMI, who in turn gave the race to Texas. This not only cost Rockingham its Nextel Cup date, but left it with no dates in any of NASCAR's national racing series in 2005 (the track's remaining Busch Series date was removed; the truck series' date was removed in 2004 with the loss of the Pop Secret 400). However, the loss of a NASCAR presence would ultimately prove a blessing in disguise for Rockingham; it is now one of the most heavily used venues for testing by NASCAR teams now that testing is prohibited at any track that hosts races in any NASCAR touring series. The second track to lose a race was Darlington, whose slot in the Chase for the Nextel Cup was given to Texas. Darlington was then left with its spring date, which was moved to Mother's Day weekend (a traditional off-weekend for the Cup Series) and lengthened to 500 miles. In addition to Texas gaining a second race, for the first time since its debut on the Cup schedule in 1988 Phoenix was granted a second date, this one in an early season slot following the spring race at Texas. NASCAR also moved the Auto Club 500, the spring race at Fontana, into Rockingham's slot on the schedule (the race immediately following the Daytona 500.) Realignment 2006‚Äì2007 After its Cup Series realignment plans, NASCAR turned to its second tier series, the Busch Series, for realignment in 2006. ISC purchased Pikes Peak International Raceway in Fountain, Colorado and immediately took its race from the Busch schedule, replacing it with an event at Martinsville Speedway. As quickly as the race at Martinsville was added to the schedule, it was removed in favor of a race in Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, adding a third road course to the series schedule. The Nextel Cup Series schedule was left untouched during this time. =Reasons for Rockingham and Darlington losing their races= NASCAR has stated that Rockingham and Darlington lost their dates because they were not selling all the tickets for those events, and that giving Darlington only one date would make a sellout more likely since it would be the only race taking place there the following year. Also, races at both tracks had been affected by rain many times over the past few years. Even if there was no rain, it was usually overcast. Darlington's only race taking place in May also put the scheduling of the race in the peak tornado season in the Southeast. However, Darlington's future seems secure, with a total sellout for the lone race from 2005 through 2008, and with many major projects being planned or done at the speedway. Due to the sellouts the track owners have considered adding more seats. Realignment 2009‚Äì10 The 2009 season, announced on August 19, 2008, went under a realignment once again after a long break. The fall race at Talladega Superspeedway was moved to a later date on the schedule around Halloween (the first Sunday in November or the final Sunday in October), one previously occupied by Atlanta Motor Speedway's fall event. That race was moved to Labor Day weekend, where California Speedway's inherited autumn event from Darlington had been, and that date was switched to Talladega's old date on the first weekend of October. In addition, the Nationwide Series dropped Mexico City's road course race for a new race in August at the Iowa Speedway, and moved the Montreal event to an open weekend on the Sprint Cup schedule (August 30) with their lone Atlanta race moving to the Labor Day weekend from March. The Camping World Truck Series replaced the spring Milwaukee Mile race with a race at Iowa Speedway to be run on August 26, and also replaced the Memorial Day weekend race at Mansfield Motorsports Park with a race later in the season at Pocono Raceway for the first time in the series' history. In 2010, the NCWTS also got rid of its second race at Auto Club Speedway. This moved all races back one weekend in the season until the first weekend of August, where a race was added at Darlington Raceway, which was put in place after an absence on the series' schedule in the previous season. Other changes included a race at Kentucky Speedway being moved from the summer to the fall. Realignment 2011 Major schedule changes were announced to combat poor attendance and poor television ratings, both of which had dropped considerably since the introduction of the Generation-5 car and for other reasons. =Sprint Cup= *Atlanta Motor Speedway's spring date was discontinued in favor of the Labor Day weekend date. *Kentucky Speedway hosted its first Sprint Cup Series race, the Quaker State 400, with room being made for it by dropping the spring Atlanta race. The formal announcement was made on August 10, 2010 and the race took the post-Coke Zero 400 slot held by Chicagoland Speedway. *Chicagoland became the opening race to the 2011 Chase for the Sprint Cup. *New Hampshire Motor Speedway hosted the second race in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, as the Sylvania 300 was moved back one week due to Chicagoland gaining the opening Chase race. *Kansas Speedway gained a spring race date. The race was run in early June immediately following the Coca-Cola 600. *Auto Club Speedway lost its fall race and Chase for the Sprint Cup date, the Pepsi Max 400. The spring race, the Auto Club 500, was moved from February to March and shortened to 400 miles/200 laps. *The spring race at Texas Motor Speedway was run on Saturday night, after having been a Sunday afternoon race. *The Subway Fresh Fit 600 at Phoenix International Raceway was moved to the second week of the season and returned to its previous distance, and is run during the day for the first time (the awarding of the second race date to Phoenix coincided with the installation of lights at the track and resulted in the race being run at night from its debut). *Dover International Speedway maintained both of its Sprint Cup weekends and with the move of Chicagoland to the Chase, Dover's Chase race moved back one week. In addition to these developments, Las Vegas Motor Speedway bid for a second date for its track and failed to get it. Track management and ownership want to move the final races of the year from Homestead-Miami Speedway (Ford Championship Weekend) to Las Vegas as all three of the major series now hold their end-of-season awards banquets there. =Nationwide Series= *Nashville Superspeedway's second date moved to late July and replaced the date held by Gateway International Raceway, which was closed by track owner Dover Motorsports following the 2010 racing season. *Chicagoland Speedway gained a second Nationwide Series date, run on June 4. *Iowa Speedway gained a second Nationwide Series date, run on May 22. *Michigan International Speedway's date moved to the weekend of the June Sprint Cup race. *Circuit Gilles Villeneuve's date moved to the weekend of the August Sprint Cup race at Michigan. *Auto Club Speedway's fall date was removed from the schedule and not replaced by another track, condensing the schedule from 35 races in 2010 to 34 races in 2011. =Camping World Truck Series= *Phoenix International Raceway's truck series date, which had been run near the end of the season for years, moved to February as part of the realignment of the Cup Series race. *Darlington Raceway's truck series date, which was run in August in 2010, moved to March. *Kentucky Speedway gained a second truck series date, to be run on the same weekend as the July Nationwide Series event, and the track's inaugural Cup race in early July. The track now hosts a triple header weekend, and the second race was moved to October. *Kansas Speedway's date moved to June as part of the Sprint Cup Series weekend. *Michigan International Speedway's date moved to the weekend of the August Sprint Cup race. Although Atlanta has had major attendance issues in recent years, with less than 100,000 fans at the last two Kobalt Tools 500 races, its new Labor Day weekend race in 2009 was a huge success. Kentucky Speedway has demanded a race for years, with its owners selling the track to Speedway Motorsports, Inc. and filing a lawsuit (which was dismissed) in efforts to get a Sprint Cup Series race. Improvements had to be made but were expected to be completed in time. Chicagoland has had major attendance issues and its TV ratings have been some of the lowest of the season in recent years. NASCAR is hoping to save the race in a major market by moving it to the Chase. Some were worried about a conflict with the IndyCar Series, which had its race there during the Labor Day weekend. However, IndyCar officials did schedule realignment of their own eliminating the conflict altogether. Kansas has also demanded a second race for years especially since the building of a casino near the track. Despite the closure of Nashville International Raceway, which is owned by Dover International Speedway, Dover maintained two race dates. Since the addition of the second race at Auto Club Speedway, attendance for both races has dropped considerably, even with a Chase race. Because NASCAR scheduled the first race at the track to immediately follow the Daytona 500 on the schedule, teams were forced to travel across the continent for the second week, hurting them financially and eventually leading to the discontinuation of the truck race there in 2010. The February race was also inconveniently scheduled on the same night as the Academy Awards ceremony (except in 2006 and 2010, when the ceremony was rescheduled to avoid conflict with the Winter Olympics), preventing major stars from appearing at the race. By returning the race to April, officials are once again hoping for a sellout. Martinsville Speedway has also had attendance issues. However, it maintained two dates for 2011. Realignment 2012‚Äì2014 NASCAR announced on September 29, 2011 that some schedule realigning would take place for the 2012 season. Although the realignment was not as drastic as past years, both of the Kansas races were affected. The spring race, which was added to the schedule for the 2011 campaign, was moved from June to April, and the spring race at Dover International Speedway returned to its traditional early June date. Kansas's fall race, a part of the Chase for the Cup, was switched with Talladega's Chase date and moved to late October. NASCAR said this realignment was due to a repaving project at the track which was scheduled to begin following the race.http://www.nascar.com/news/110927/2012-cup-schedule-released/index.html In addition, the race at Kentucky Speedway moved to June preceding the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona International Speedway. Rockingham returned to NASCAR as part of the Truck Series and K&N; Pro Series. The 2013 realignment did not see any significant changes, other than switching back the Talladega and Kansas Chase races to their original dates. The 2014 realignment also had few changes. The dates were swapped for the spring races at Darlington and Kansas, turning Kansas's spring race into a night race. The spring race at Texas Motor Speedway was moved from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon so as not to interfere with the NCAA Men's Tournament, which began the same weekend in nearby AT&T; Stadium. Texas and Martinsville were moved up a week. The Darlington date moved to Texas's original spot on the schedule. The Easter off-week moved to Kansas's original date. Realignment 2015 The 2015 alignment saw several drastic changes: *Once again, Darlington was moved, this time returning to its original Labor Day weekend for the first time in 12 years. *The Food City 500, Bristol's spring race, was moved to Darlington's 2014 position on the schedule, in hopes of running it in warmer weather conditions as opposed to the cold and sometimes rainy conditions that had plagued the mid-March date. *Atlanta's race was moved to the post-Daytona 500 date. *The spring Phoenix race was moved to what had been Bristol's spring date. Because Las Vegas and Auto Club stayed in their original positions, the series now had an uninterrupted streak of three races on the West Coast, nicknamed the \\"West Coast swing\\". This was done not only to please the fans, but it also meant that drivers and their teams would not have to make as many cross-country treks back to their shops in Charlotte. *The off-weeks were relocated: the traditional Easter off-weekend now fell between Martinsville and Texas, and the summer off-week that originally took place between New Hampshire and the Brickyard 400 was repositioned to the week between Michigan's Quicken Loans 400 and Sonoma's Toyota/Save Mart 350. *Sonoma took Kentucky's original date, and Kentucky took New Hampshire's July date. New Hampshire's summer date was moved to the original summer off-weekend. Due to 2015 being the first year of a new broadcasting contract between NASCAR, Fox and NBC, these changes to the summer schedule were done so that both networks started their coverage of the NASCAR season with a Daytona race, with FOX getting the Daytona 500 and NBC getting the Coke Zero 400. Additionally, for 2015 only, the Coke Zero 400 was run as a Sunday night race, since July 4 was on a Saturday when many NBC affiliate networks broadcast fireworks displays. *The season also received an additional off-weekend on the weekend prior to Labor Day weekend, making the regular season 40 weeks long (with three off- weekends and the off-weekend for the All-Star race). *The Chase dates at Charlotte and Kansas were flipped, with Charlotte becoming the opening race in the Contender Round of the Chase. Realignment 2016 The 2016 alignment saw some changes to the schedule *The Easter off-week is placed late-March between Fontana and Martinsville. *The Coke Zero 400 at Daytona will return to its usual Saturday night date. *Michigan and Bristol swap their August race dates. *The third off-week was moved to mid-August between Watkins Glen and Bristol, instead of the late-August break between Bristol and Darlington. This was done to avoid a scheduling conflict with the 2016 Summer Olympics being hosted on NBC. The aforementioned Olympics conflict forced the race at Watkins Glen to be moved to USA Network *The first race at Dover and the Memorial Day week swapped dates, so the last race before the All-Star Race was Dover instead of Kansas, because of Memorial Day being very late similar to 2011. Realignment 2017 The final calendar for the 2017 season was released on May 5, 2016. Key changes from 2016 include: * The Daytona 500 was moved back a week. * The Texas spring race was moved from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon. * Dover's spring race was moved back to the slot between the Coca-Cola 600 and the June Pocono race. * Bristol and Michigan swapped back their August race dates. * Talladega and Kansas swapped their October race dates, making Talladega the second race in the Round of 12 and turning Kansas into an elimination race. * The summer off week moves back between Bristol and Darlington. * The start times for several races, including the Daytona 500, were adjusted so as to have the event end during primetime. Realignment 2018 The 2018 Cup Series season schedule was released on May 23, 2017 and saw some notable changes, which were how: * The Advance Auto Parts Clash was moved back to Sunday afternoon (a week before the Daytona 500 after being held on the Saturday night before that for many years. * The 60th running of the Daytona 500 would be moved one week earlier to be held on President's Day weekend (in 2018, falling on Sunday, February 18), how it was until after 2011 and many years before that. * Dover International Speedway's spring race, was moved one month early to precede the KC Masterpiece 400 at Kansas Speedway and the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. * There was an additional off-week for the Cup Series in the schedule for 2018 on the Father's Day weekend. That provided some flexibility for Fox so they could broadcast the U. S. Open and the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The other off weekends remained being on Easter weekend (as it always has been) and in late-summer between the Bristol night race and the race at Darlington on Labor Day weekend. * The race at Chicagoland was moved off of the playoffs and back to early in the summertime before the Coke Zero Sugar 400 (how it was like until after 2010). This change resulted in NBC's portion of the TV schedule beginning at Chicago and not Daytona. * The Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway moved to September to become the final race of the regular season after years of being in late July or early August. * New Hampshire Motor Speedway's fall race was eliminated and replaced with a new second race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, the South Point 400, replaced on the schedule and will be the playoffs opener. * The Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond Raceway moved from being the final race of the regular season to the second race in the playoffs, replacing the New Hampshire/Las Vegas race, which was bumped back a week to become the first race of the playoffs. * Charlotte Motor Speedway's fall race moved a week earlier into late September from early October and for the first time utilized the track's road course layout instead of its quad-oval, becoming the Bank of America Roval 400, and it also became the closing race to the Round of 16 in the playoffs. * The fall race at Dover was moved one week later in the season to become the first race of the Round of 12 in the playoffs, flip-flopping places with Charlotte. Realignment 2020 =Cup Series= The 2020 schedule for the NASCAR Cup Series will undergo a series of significant changes. *The Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway will move behind the West Coast swing to March 15, 2020, returning to its pre-2010 date of mid-March. *The race at Homestead‚ÄìMiami Speedway will no longer serve as the final race of the season ending a tradition that dated back to 2002 and bringing an end to Ford Championship Weekend. The race date will move to March 22, 2020, following the race at Atlanta, and become known as the Dixie Vodka 400. *After 21 years of being NASCAR's Fourth of July weekend event (and 60 of 61 years overall), the Coke Zero Sugar 400 at Daytona International Speedway will move to August and become the final race of NASCAR's \\"regular season\\". The Brickyard 400, run at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, will switch race weekends with Daytona. *The Blu-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway will be run under the lights for the first time on May 9, Mother's Day Weekend. *Kansas Speedway's spring race, the Super Start Batteries 400 that has been run under the lights on Mother's Day Weekend will move from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon and be held on May 31, 2020, after the Coca-Cola 600. *Both events at Pocono Raceway will be run on consecutive days the weekend of June 27‚Äì28. *Dover International Speedway's second date moves to late August, marking the first time the race has not been in NASCAR's postseason. *The Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway and the Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race at Bristol Motor Speedway will both become Playoff races in place of Dover and Homestead. This will mark the first time since the inaugural Chase for the NEXTEL Cup in 2004 that Darlington will host a postseason event (that race was given to Texas in the Ferko lawsuit in 2005) and the first postseason race of any kind for Bristol. *The Championship Round of the Playoffs will be conducted at Phoenix Raceway on November 8. This will be the first Phoenix race to close out the season. Due to this and the consolidation of the Pocono doubleheader, the 2020 season will actually end one week earlier than in the past. Usually the season finale is held on third weekend in November. Those dates being anywhere from November 16th-November 22nd. *The Toyota Owners 400 at Richmond will move back to Sunday afternoon, similar to 2015-2017 when it was run on a Sunday afternoon. This was done because the two Martinsville Speedway races will be night races in 2020, as both races will start in the day and end at night. *There will be two off weeks between Loudon and Michigan to accommodate the NBC networks coverage of the 2020 Summer Olympics, meaning the off week for the U.S. Open Golf Championship that Fox instituted will be removed. This prevents a conflict that happened at the 2016 Olympics, when NBC moved the Watkins Glen race to their USA Network. NBC's half starts on the weekend of that golf championship. =Xfinity Series= * Atlanta will no longer be the second race of the season and moves a month later to become the fifth race of the season, and also the first race after the West Coast swing. * The order of races in the West Coast swing changes, with the series now going to Auto Club Speedway (Fontana) before Phoenix Raceway (Phoenix) instead of the other way around as it had been in the past. Because there will be no race in between Daytona and the West Coast swing, Las Vegas will now be the second race of the season (instead of the third) and the flip-flop of California and Phoenix will be the third and fourth races. (Phoenix had been the fourth race previously and now is still the fourth race after this switch.) * After being the season-finale for the Xfinity Series since 1995 and all three national series since 2002, Homestead-Miami Speedway lost its place as the last race of the season and will instead have its race in March between Atlanta and Texas on a weekend that had previously been an off weekend which will now be in April the week after Bristol. * After previously having two races on the schedule, Richmond lost its spring date in favor of a race at Martinsville in October, which marks the series' first trip to the track in 14 years, when it hosted a race for one year in 2006 (in between when the series stopped going to Pikes Peak after 2005 and started going to Montreal in 2007). The race at Martinsville in October will be the second-to-last race of the season and the last race of the Round of 8 in the playoffs. * After being held sometime in August every year it has been on the schedule, Mid-Ohio moves earlier in the season to become the first race held after Charlotte on Memorial Day weekend, replacing Pocono. * Pocono's race will be held on the last week of June, replacing Chicagoland. The race will be held on a Sunday afternoon instead of Saturday afternoon as part of the new \\"doubleheader-weekend\\" where the Cup Series will run both of their races at the track on the same weekend on consecutive days (on Saturday in addition to the Truck Series and Sunday in addition to the Xfinity Series). * Chicago's race moves a week earlier than it was in 2019. It now falls on Father's Day weekend, which had previously been an off-weekend for the series, and that off-weekend was moved to July after the race at New Hampshire. * After having hosted a night race on the Fourth of July weekend since 2002 in the Xfinity Series, Daytona's summer race will now be in August, trading places with Indianapolis. * Iowa's second race moves back a week, on the weekend where Watkins Glen had been. * After Mid-Ohio's race moved back to late May/early June, Road America's race moved into that weekend in August from where it had been previously later in the month. * Watkins Glen moved two weeks later in place of the Bristol Night Race, which will now be a month later and part of the playoffs. * Dover‚Äôs second race was knocked out of the playoffs and into the regular seasons as a result of Bristol being put in. That race at Dover will now be held on August 22nd (the weekend where Road America had been). * Since Labor Day falls later in the year in 2020, the race at Daytona (Indy in 2019) will now be held before Darlington instead of after so Darlington can remain on Labor Day weekend. * The race at Richmond will now be earlier in September and become the last race before the start of the playoffs based on how the schedule works and Las Vegas Motor Speedway moves later in the month and into the playoffs. * The Charlotte Roval race is now later in the fall and in October instead of September. * After being the second-to-last race of the season for many years, Phoenix Raceway (Phoenix) will be the last race of the season after Homestead was bumped back to March. However, because of how the schedule works (only one off-weekend in the playoffs instead of two), it will remain on the same weekend in early November, and the season will end a week earlier than in the past. Additionally, because of the schedule changes, Homestead and Mid-Ohio will now be Fox races and Pocono as well as the new Martinsville race will be NBC races. It will be the first time Fox has ever broadcast a NASCAR Xfinity race at Homestead. Mid-Ohio will mark Fox's first broadcast of a road course race in the Xfinity Series since Mexico City in 2006 (which was under the old 2001-2006 TV contract). =Truck Series= * After being the season-finale for the Truck Series since 2002, Homestead‚ÄìMiami Speedway lost its place as the last race of the season and will instead have its race in March between Atlanta and Texas * The Truck Series will return to Richmond Raceway for the first time since 2005 * Michigan International Speedway will serve as the final race of the regular season * World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway will host the Playoff opener for the Gander Trucks * The Round of 10 will end at Bristol Motor Speedway * The Round of 8 will end at Martinsville Speedway * The Championship Round of the Playoffs will be conducted at Phoenix Raceway on November 6. This will be the first Phoenix race to close out the season 2020 coronavirus pandemic changes =Cup Series= *The Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway and the Dixie Vodka 400 at Homestead‚ÄìMiami Speedway were originally announced on March 12, 2020 due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to take place without fans in attendance, but one day later on March 13, 2020, NASCAR announced that the two Cup races (including support races) would be postponed. * On March 16, 2020, NASCAR announced all race events through May 3 have been postponed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. * On April 17, 2020, NASCAR announced that Martinsville Speedway race weekend on May 8‚Äì9 had been postponed, although the sanctioning body affirmed its commitment to running a full 36-race schedule. * On April 30, 2020, NASCAR announced a revised schedule for the month of May, with two Cup races at Darlington Raceway and two points-paying races at Charlotte Motor Speedway, including the Coca-Cola 600 that will be run with no fans in the stands. Darlington's newly added spring date would become permanent in 2021. * On May 8, 2020, NASCAR announced that Sonoma Raceway and Chicagoland Speedway would not host Cup races in 2020, and that Richmond Raceway's postponed spring date would not be rescheduled. Eventually, on September 29, 2020, NASCAR closed Chicagoland Speedway. * On May 14, 2020, NASCAR announced another revised schedule, this time to show the races planned for the end of May through June 21. These tracks include Bristol Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway, Martinsville Speedway, Homestead-Miami Speedway, and Talladega Superspeedway. NASCAR also announced a continuation of its empty stands policy for those races. Eventually, NASCAR began allowing spectators to both Homestead and Talladega. * With the exception of the Coca- Cola 600, all races starting with NASCAR's return at Darlington through the Homestead race at minimum will feature no practice or qualifying. Teams will unload, have cars inspected, and race. The Coca-Cola 600 will feature qualifying only a few hours before the race but no practice. * On July 8, NASCAR announced the next phase of revisions to the schedule through the conclusion of the regular season in August; this includes twin race weekends at Dover and Michigan (with the races shortened to 500 kilometers each), and the Go Bowling at The Glen being replaced by the Daytona Grand Prix ‚Äî NASCAR's first ever road course race at Daytona International Speedway. It was reported that the replacement of the Watkins Glen race was necessitated by travel restrictions imposed by the state of New York, which currently require 14 days self-isolation for anyone entering the state from areas designated as having large numbers of recent COVID-19 cases (including North Carolina, where the majority of NASCAR teams and staff are based). Fans may be admitted at events on a case-by-case basis depending on local health orders. =Xfinity Series= *The EchoPark 250 at Atlanta Motor Speedway and the Hooters 250 at Homestead‚ÄìMiami Speedway were originally announced on March 12, 2020 due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to take place without fans in attendance, but one day later on March 13, 2020, NASCAR announced that the two Cup races (including support races) would be postponed. * On March 16, 2020, NASCAR announced all race events through May 3 were postponed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. * On April 30, 2020, the sanctioning body announced an updated schedule for the month of May that included Xfinity races at Darlington Raceway and Charlotte Motor Speedway. * On May 8, 2020, NASCAR announced that Chicagoland Speedway will not host an Xfinity Series race in 2020. A 2nd event at Darlington Raceway will replace the Chicagoland's race. That will be the first time since 2004 that Darlington hosts 2 Xfinity Series events in the same year. *On May 14, 2020, NASCAR announced that Iowa Speedway will not host an Xfinity Series race in 2020. A second event at Homestead- Miami Speedway will replace the first Iowa's race. That will be the first time ever that Homestead hosts two Xfinity Series events in the same year. * On May 27, 2020, it was announced that the rescheduled Bristol race, scheduled for Saturday, May 30, would be rescheduled again to Monday, June 1 as a result of the Cup race at Charlotte originally scheduled for May 27 being delayed by a day due to rain. The reason for moving the Xfinity Bristol race was because the Fox NASCAR TV equipment would not be set up and ready in time. * The Dash 4 Cash races were supposed to be at Texas Motor Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway and Dover International Speedway, but after the all the COVID-19 schedule changes, they changed to Atlanta, Homestead, and Talladega with Bristol now serving as the qualification race for the Dash 4 Cash. Despite being in the middle of the races that do have it, the Saturday Homestead race will not be a Dash 4 Cash race. * On July 8, 2020, NASCAR announced the series' schedule in the month of August. This included the move of the Watkins Glen race to the Daytona infield road course as a result of failing to get a waiver of Governor Andrew Cuomo's 14 day quarantine rule for anyone entering the state of New York from states that are COVID-19 hot spots, which includes North Carolina, where NASCAR teams are based. In that announcement, it was also made official that the standalone race at Mid-Ohio race would be cancelled and replaced, and the same would go for the June Michigan race, which had been scheduled in June but when the Cup Series races became a doubleheader, the date clashed with Road America, despite being a standalone race. * On August 6, 2020, NASCAR announced that an additional race at Talladega would replace the cancelled Mid-Ohio race and will be part of the Xfinity Series playoffs. An additional race at Richmond would replace the cancelled Michigan event. In that announcement, it was also revealed that the Xfinity Series playoff opener has been moved to Las Vegas Motor Speedway. =Truck Series= * On March 12, 2020, it was announced that the Vet Tix/Camping World 200 at Atlanta Motor Speedway and the Diabetes Can Break Your Heart 200 at Homestead‚ÄìMiami Speedway would take place without fans in attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the following day, NASCAR announced that those races (along with the Cup and Xfinity races on those same weekends, also at Atlanta and Homestead) would be outright postponed instead. * On March 16, 2020, NASCAR announced all race events through May 3 would be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. * On May 8, 2020, NASCAR announced that Chicagoland Speedway would not host their Truck race, the Camping World 225, for this season only as part of the COVID-19 schedule changes. * On May 14, 2020, NASCAR announced that Iowa Speedway would not host a Truck race, the M&M;'s 200, for this season only as part of the COVID-19 schedule changes. * On July 8, 2020, NASCAR announced the series' schedule in the month of August. This included the addition of a race at the Daytona infield road course which replaced the cancelled Iowa race. In that announcement, it was also made official that the standalone race at Eldora would be cancelled and replaced and the same would go for the Canadian Tire Motorsport Park playoff race. Gateway remained on the schedule despite being a standalone race. Additionally, because of the loss of these two races, the Gateway race became part of the regular season instead of the first race of the playoffs, and Kansas and Texas will be in the playoffs. * On August 6, 2020, NASCAR announced that a race at Darlington would replace the cancelled Canadian Tire Motorsports Motorsport Park race and will be part of the regular season. It marks the series‚Äô first event at the historic track in more than nine years. A third race at Kansas would replace the cancelled Eldora event and will be part of the playoffs. In that announcement, it was also revealed that the series‚Äô playoff opener has been moved to Bristol Motor Speedway. In NASCAR's first races back since the pandemic hit, there would be no practice or qualifying held so that teams would not need to bring additional crew members to the track and would not need to bring backup cars. (Crew members would be in contact with each other when repairing a primary car damaged in practice or qualifying or to prepare a backup car if a team had to utilize it). In the Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series and Xfinity Series races that will be held without practice and qualifying, NASCAR announced that the field size temporarily will be expanded to a maximum of 40 vehicles each. The field will be set by a random draw, similar to NASCAR Cup Series. Realignment 2021 =Cup Series= *The Busch Clash will be moved from the Sunday before the Daytona 500 to the Tuesday before (on February 9), in an effort to condense Speedweeks down to one week. The race will also be moved from the oval to the infield road course for the first time. The Daytona 500 will be held on Sunday, February 14. *Phoenix Raceway will host Cup races on March 7 and November 7, the latter being the championship date. *Nashville Superspeedway will host a Cup race, scheduled for Sunday, June 20 (Father's Day). It will be the first time the speedway will host a NASCAR Cup Series event, and the first time the track has hosted any NASCAR events since 2011. In order to put the track on the schedule, its owner, Dover Motorsports, moved one of their two Cup races at Dover (a track which they also own) to Nashville. *On September 29, it was reported that Kentucky Speedway and Chicagoland Speedway would not be on the 2021 schedule, *On September 30, NASCAR announced that Atlanta Motor Speedway would expand to two races, picking up the Quaker State 400 from Kentucky. *On the same day, Road America was added back to the schedule for the first time since a Grand National race 65 years prior. The race is scheduled for July 4, replacing the race weekend at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. *With the release of the 2021 schedule, NASCAR announced that its race at Indianapolis would be run on the track‚Äôs road course configuration. *The Cup Series will also race on dirt for the first time since 1970 as the spring race at Bristol Motor Speedway will have the concrete half-mile covered in dirt.

Thus an atomic-scale system was shown to have intrinsically quantum properties. In the original experiment, silver atoms were sent through a spatially varying magnetic field, which deflected them before they struck a detector screen, such as a glass slide. Particles with non-zero magnetic moment are deflected, due to the magnetic field gradient, from a straight path. The screen reveals discrete points of accumulation, rather than a continuous distribution, owing to their quantized spin. Historically, this experiment was decisive in convincing physicists of the reality of angular- momentum quantization in all atomic-scale systems. After its conception by Otto Stern in 1921, the experiment was first successfully conducted by Walther Gerlach in early 1922.  Description  Video explaining quantum spin versus classical magnet in the Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment The Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment involves sending a beam of silver atoms through an inhomogeneous magnetic field and observing their deflection. The results show that particles possess an intrinsic angular momentum that is closely analogous to the angular momentum of a classically spinning object, but that takes only certain quantized values. Another important result is that only one component of a particle's spin can be measured at one time, meaning that the measurement of the spin along the z-axis destroys information about a particle's spin along the x and y axis. The experiment is normally conducted using electrically neutral particles such as silver atoms. This avoids the large deflection in the path of a charged particle moving through a magnetic field and allows spin-dependent effects to dominate.Mott, N.F., Massey, H.S.W. (1965/1971). The Theory of Atomic Collisions, third edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, pp. 214‚Äì219, ¬ß2, Ch. , reprinted in If the particle is treated as a classical spinning magnetic dipole, it will precess in a magnetic field because of the torque that the magnetic field exerts on the dipole (see torque-induced precession). If it moves through a homogeneous magnetic field, the forces exerted on opposite ends of the dipole cancel each other out and the trajectory of the particle is unaffected. However, if the magnetic field is inhomogeneous then the force on one end of the dipole will be slightly greater than the opposing force on the other end, so that there is a net force which deflects the particle's trajectory. If the particles were classical spinning objects, one would expect the distribution of their spin angular momentum vectors to be random and continuous. Each particle would be deflected by an amount proportional to its magnetic moment, producing some density distribution on the detector screen. Instead, the particles passing through the Stern‚ÄìGerlach apparatus are deflected either up or down by a specific amount. This was a measurement of the quantum observable now known as spin angular momentum, which demonstrated possible outcomes of a measurement where the observable has a discrete set of values or point spectrum. Although some discrete quantum phenomena, such as atomic spectra, were observed much earlier, the Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment allowed scientists to observe separation between discrete quantum states for the first time in the history of science. Theoretically, quantum angular momentum of any kind has a discrete spectrum, which is sometimes briefly expressed as \\"angular momentum is quantized\\". = Experiment using particles with + or ‚àí spin = If the experiment is conducted using charged particles like electrons, there will be a Lorentz force that tends to bend the trajectory in a circle. This force can be cancelled by an electric field of appropriate magnitude oriented transverse to the charged particle's path. Spin values for fermions Electrons are spin- particles. These have only two possible spin angular momentum values measured along any axis, +\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} or -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}, a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon. Because its value is always the same, it is regarded as an intrinsic property of electrons, and is sometimes known as \\"intrinsic angular momentum\\" (to distinguish it from orbital angular momentum, which can vary and depends on the presence of other particles). If one measures the spin along a vertical axis, electrons are described as \\"spin up\\" or \\"spin down\\", based on the magnetic moment pointing up or down, respectively. To mathematically describe the experiment with spin +\\\\frac{1}{2} particles, it is easiest to use Dirac's bra‚Äìket notation. As the particles pass through the Stern‚ÄìGerlach device, they are deflected either up or down, and observed by the detector which resolves to either spin up or spin down. These are described by the angular momentum quantum number j, which can take on one of the two possible allowed values, either +\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} or -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}. The act of observing (measuring) the momentum along the z axis corresponds to the operator J_z. In mathematical terms, the initial state of the particles is :\\\\psi\\\\rangle = c_1\\\\left\\\\psi_{j = +\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}}\\\\right\\\\rangle + c_2\\\\left\\\\psi_{j = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}}\\\\right\\\\rangle where constants c_1 and c_2 are complex numbers. This initial state spin can point in any direction. The squares of the absolute values c_1^2 and c_2^2 determine the probabilities that for a system in the initial state \\\\psi\\\\rangle one of the two possible values of j is found after the measurement is made. The constants c_1 and c_2 must also be normalized in order that the probability of finding either one of the values be unity, that is we must ensure that c_1^2 + c_2^2 = 1. However, this information is not sufficient to determine the values of c_1 and c_2, because they are complex numbers. Therefore, the measurement yields only the squared magnitudes of the constants, which are interpreted as probabilities. Sequential experiments If we link multiple Stern‚ÄìGerlach apparatuses (the rectangles containing S-G), we can clearly see that they do not act as simple selectors, i.e. filtering out particles with one of the states (pre-existing to the measurement) and blocking the others. Instead they alter the state by observing it (as in light polarization). In the figure below, x and z name the directions of the (inhomogenous) magnetic field, with the x-z-plane being orthogonal to the particle beam. In the three S-G systems shown below, the cross-hatched squares denote the blocking of a given output, i.e. each of the S-G systems with a blocker allows only particles with one of two states to enter the next S-G apparatus in the sequence. 640px The top illustration shows that when a second, identical, S-G apparatus is placed at the exit of the z+ beam resulting of the first apparatus, only z+ is seen in the output of the second apparatus. This result is expected since only the z+ beam from the first apparatus entered the second apparatus. The middle system shows what happens when a different S-G apparatus is placed at the exit of the z+ beam resulting of the first apparatus, the second apparatus measuring the deflection of the beams on the x axis instead of the z axis. The second apparatus produces x+ and x- outputs. Now classically we would expect to have one beam with the x characteristic oriented + and the z characteristic oriented +, and another with the x characteristic oriented - and the z characteristic oriented +. The bottom system contradicts that expectation. The output of the third apparatus which measures the deflection on the z axis again shows z- as well as z+. Given that the input to the second S-G apparatus consisted only of z+, it can be inferred that a S-G apparatus must be altering the states of the particles that pass through it. This experiment can be interpreted to exhibit the uncertainty principle : since the angular momentum cannot be measured on two perpendicular directions at the same time, the measurement of the angular momentum on the x direction destroys the previous determination of the angular momentum in the z direction. That's why the third apparatus measures renewed z+ and z- beams like the x measurement really made a clean slate of the z+ output. History A plaque at the Frankfurt institute commemorating the experiment The Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment was conceived by Otto Stern in 1921 and performed by him and Walther Gerlach in Frankfurt in 1922. At the time, Stern was an assistant to Max Born at the University of Frankfurt's Institute for Theoretical Physics, and Gerlach was an assistant at the same university's Institute for Experimental Physics. At the time of the experiment, the most prevalent model for describing the atom was the Bohr model, which described electrons as going around the positively charged nucleus only in certain discrete atomic orbitals or energy levels. Since the electron was quantized to be only in certain positions in space, the separation into distinct orbits was referred to as space quantization. The Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment was meant to test the Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld hypothesis that the direction of the angular momentum of a silver atom is quantized. Note that the experiment was performed several years before Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit formulated their hypothesis of the existence of the electron spin. Even though the result of the Stern‚àíGerlach experiment has later turned out to be in agreement with the predictions of quantum mechanics for a spin- particle, the experiment should be seen as a corroboration of the Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld theory. In 1927, T.E. Phipps and J.B. Taylor reproduced the effect using hydrogen atoms in their ground state, thereby eliminating any doubts that may have been caused by the use of silver atoms. However, in 1926 the non-relativistic Schr√∂dinger equation had incorrectly predicted the magnetic moment of hydrogen to be zero in its ground state. To correct this problem Wolfgang Pauli introduced \\"by hand\\", so to speak, the 3 Pauli matrices which now bear his name, but which were later shown by Paul Dirac in 1928 to be intrinsic in his relativistic equation. The experiment was first performed with an electromagnet that allowed the non-uniform magnetic field to be turned on gradually from a null value. When the field was null, the silver atoms were deposited as a single band on the detecting glass slide. When the field was made stronger, the middle of the band began to widen and eventually to split into two, so that the glass-slide image looked like a lip-print, with an opening in the middle, and closure at either end.French, A.P., Taylor, E.F. (1979). An Introduction to Quantum Physics, Van Nostrand Reinhold, London, , pp. 428‚Äì442. In the middle, where the magnetic field was strong enough to split the beam into two, statistically half of the silver atoms had been deflected by the non-uniformity of the field. Importance The Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment strongly influenced later developments in modern physics: *In the decade that followed, scientists showed using similar techniques, that the nuclei of some atoms also have quantized angular momentum. It is the interaction of this nuclear angular momentum with the spin of the electron that is responsible for the hyperfine structure of the spectroscopic lines. *In the 1930s, using an extended version of the Stern‚ÄìGerlach apparatus, Isidor Rabi and colleagues showed that by using a varying magnetic field, one can force the magnetic moment to go from one state to the other. The series of experiments culminated in 1937 when they discovered that state transitions could be induced using time varying fields or RF fields. The so-called Rabi oscillation is the working mechanism for the Magnetic Resonance Imaging equipment found in hospitals. * Norman F. Ramsey later modified the Rabi apparatus to increase the interaction time with the field. The extreme sensitivity due to the frequency of the radiation makes this very useful for keeping accurate time, and it is still used today in atomic clocks. * In the early sixties, Ramsey and Daniel Kleppner used a Stern‚ÄìGerlach system to produce a beam of polarized hydrogen as the source of energy for the hydrogen Maser, which is still one of the most popular atomic clocks. * The direct observation of the spin is the most direct evidence of quantization in quantum mechanics. * The Stern-Gerlach experiment has become a prototype for quantum measurement, demonstrating the observation of a single, real value (eigenvalue) of an initially unknown physical property. Entering the Stern- Gerlach magnet, the direction of the silver atom‚Äôs magnetic moment is indefinite, but it is observed to be either parallel, or anti-parallel to the direction of the magnetic field, B, at the exit of the magnet. Atoms with a magnetic moment parallel to B have been accelerated in that direction by the magnetic field gradient; those with anti-parallel moments were accelerated the opposite way. So, each atom traversing the magnet will strike the detector ((5) in the diagram) at just one of the two spots. According to quantum measurement theory, the wavefunction representing the atom‚Äôs magnetic moment is in a superposition of those two directions entering the magnet. A single, spin-direction eigenvalue is recorded when a momentum quantum is transferred, from the magnetic field, to the atom, initiating acceleration, and displacement, in that momentum direction.

The card or the Medicare number is required to be provided to enable the cardholder to receive a rebate of medical expenses under Australia's Medicare system, as well as subsidised medications under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The card is usually green in colour, although interim cards are light blue and cards for Reciprocal Health Care Agreement visitors are light yellow. The cards are issued by a government agency called Medicare Australia. All permanent residents of Australia are entitled to a Medicare card, except for those who are deemed to be not residing in Australia. Citizenship is not necessary to be eligible for a Medicare card. The card lists an individual as well as any members of his or her family he or she chooses to add who are also permanent residents and meet the Medicare definition of dependent. The card must be produced or the Medicare number provided if the Medicare rebate is paid directly to the doctor under the bulk billing system. The doctor can retain the Medicare number for use when the patient returns for another consultation. It is also necessary to provide a Medicare number (although not necessarily show the card) to gain access to the public hospital system to be treated at no cost as a public patient. For non-elective treatment (e.g. emergency), public hospitals will admit patients without a number or card and resolve Medicare eligibility issues after treatment. Use of the card Medicare Australia supplies Medicare cards and numbers. Almost every eligible person has a card: in June 2002 there were 20.4 million Medicare cardholders, and the Australian population was less than 20 million at the time (overseas Australian cardholders may still have a card). The use of the card is relevant only to consultations with medical practitioners who have been issued with a Medicare provider number. Such access has been made subject to increasing requirements since the mid-1990s. The Medicare card is used for health care purposes only and cannot be used to track in a database a number of activities. It contains a name and number, and no visible photograph. Individuals are not legally required to have a Medicare card, to carry it with them, or to produce it on request. The primary purpose of the Medicare card is to prove eligibility when seeking Australian Medicare-subsidised care from a medical practitioner or hospital. Legally, the card need not be produced and a Medicare number is sufficient. Since 2002, a Medicare card has been required to be shown at a pharmacy when collecting Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medications. The pharmacy can retain the number for use when the cardholder returns with another prescription. The Medicare card is used as a recognised form of ID in opening bank accounts or obtaining a driver's license. On the ‚Äò100 point scale‚Äô, on which 100 points of ID are required for proof of identity, a Medicare card generally counts for 30 points. The Medicare card will also be required when accessing medical, hospital or pharmaceutical services in a country with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement. Rebates The Medicare scheme entitles most Australian residents to a rebate of medical and some other expenses paid for consultations with a medical practitioner who holds a current Medicare provider number. The medical practitioner will usually apply for, maintain and quote a provider number on their tax invoices. Without quoting a valid provider number, a practitioner's patients will not be entitled to a rebate of their medical expenses. A practitioner who is in breach of a contract with the Commonwealth may face a 12-year prohibition on access to a provider number. This means that a Medicare cardholder cannot obtain a rebate of expenses paid to a prohibited practitioner regardless of the practitioner's registration at any (state) board or specialty for the period that the practitioner is without a provider number. Issue of Medicare cards Medicare cards are issued by Medicare Australia (until late 2005 known as the Health Insurance Commission or HIC) to individuals and their families. A maximum of five names can be included on a card. Families with more than five members will have additional names listed on additional cards, while retaining the same card number. Children are listed on their parent's card ‚Äì a family may be all on one card, or a child may be listed on one parent's card, or both parents' cards, or even in some cases, alone on their own card if their name exceeds a specific number of letters. Children who are wards of the state will be listed on a card with the Department of Children's Services as cardholder. Medicare cards may be used to show a relationship when parents have different surnames to their children. Individual Medicare cards are generally only issued to people over 15. This is a Medicare Australia policy (not legislation) and there are exceptions for people at boarding schools or away from home. Significantly, this policy may detract from the right of a mature minor to gain confidential medical care. Using their family's Medicare card (and presenting the card) could potentially notify their parents of the consultation, but only if the parents request information about their child's medical claims and for a person to request information about medical claims for people 14 years and over they must have the permission of that person they are requesting the information for. Proposed Australia and Access Cards Several unsuccessful proposals have been made to expand the scope of use of the Medicare card, such as the an Australia Card proposal. In 2005, plans to expand the functions of the Medicare card were announced by then Howard Government Human Services Minister Joe Hockey. The new card, to be called the Access Card, was intended to replace both the Medicare and up to 17 other similar cards (such as Centrelink benefit and concession cards),Official Access Card FAQ Archived from the original on 2007-10-02. and to commence operation in 2008. However, the scheme was criticised by some sectors of the public and relevant interest groups as a step in the same direction of an Australia Card. The Howard government was unable to implement the scheme before the government's electoral defeat in 2007. The incoming Labor Government announced on 7 December 2007 that the Access Card scheme would be abandoned.Canberra to cancel access card, Australian IT, 27 Nov 2007Labor swift to dump Access Card, Australian IT, 7 Dec 2007 The same aims were later achieved with myGov from 2013.

Nodes of Ranvier are uninsulated and highly enriched in ion channels, allowing them to participate in the exchange of ions required to regenerate the action potential. Nerve conduction in myelinated axons is referred to as saltatory conduction (from the Latin saltare \\"to hop or to leap\\") due to the manner in which the action potential seems to \\"jump\\" from one node to the next along the axon. This results in faster conduction of the action potential. Overview Many vertebrate axons are surrounded by a myelin sheath, allowing rapid and efficient saltatory (\\"jumping\\") propagation of action potentials. The contacts between neurons and glial cells display a very high level of spatial and temporal organization in myelinated fibers. The myelinating glial cells; oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), are wrapped around the axon, leaving the axolemma relatively uncovered at the regularly spaced nodes of Ranvier. The internodal glial membranes are fused to form compact myelin, whereas the cytoplasm-filled paranodal loops of myelinating cells are spirally wrapped around the axon at both sides of the nodes. This organization demands a tight developmental control and the formation of a variety of specialized zones of contact between different areas of the myelinating cell membrane. Each node of Ranvier is flanked by paranodal regions where helicoidally wrapped glial loops are attached to the axonal membrane by a septate-like junction. The segment between nodes of Ranvier is termed as the internode, and its outermost part that is in contact with paranodes is referred to as the juxtaparanodal region. The nodes are encapsulated by microvilli stemming from the outer aspect of the Schwann cell membrane in the PNS, or by perinodal extensions from astrocytes in the CNS. Structure The internodes are the myelin segments and the gaps between are referred to as nodes. The size and the spacing of the internodes vary with the fiber diameter in a curvilinear relationship that is optimized for maximal conduction velocity. The size of the nodes span from 1‚Äì2 Œºm whereas the internodes can be up to (and occasionally even greater than)1.5 millimetres long, depending on the axon diameter and fiber type. The structure of the node and the flanking paranodal regions are distinct from the internodes under the compact myelin sheath, but are very similar in CNS and PNS. The axon is exposed to the extra-cellular environment at the node and is constricted in its diameter. The decreased axon size reflects a higher packing density of neurofilaments in this region, which are less heavily phosphorylated and are transported more slowly. Vesicles and other organelles are also increased at the nodes, which suggest that there is a bottleneck of axonal transport in both directions as well as local axonal-glial signaling. When a longitudinal section is made through a myelinating Schwann cell at the node, three distinctive segments are represented: the stereotypic internode, the paranodal region, and the node itself. In the internodal region, the Schwann cell has an outer collar of cytoplasm, a compact myelin sheath, and inner collar of cytoplasm, and the axolemma. At the paranodal regions, the paranodal cytoplasm loops contact thickenings of the axolemma to form septate ‚Äìlike junctions. In the node alone, the axolemma is contacted by several Schwann microvilli and contains a dense cytoskeletal undercoating. =Differences in the central and peripheral nervous systems= Although freeze fracture studies have revealed that the nodal axolemma in both the CNS and PNS is enriched in intra-membranous particles (IMPs) compared to the internode, there are some structural differences reflecting their cellular constituents. In the PNS, specialized microvilli project from the outer collar of Schwann cells and come very close to nodal axolemma of large fibers. The projections of the Schwann cells are perpendicular to the node and are radiating from the central axons. However, in the CNS, one or more of the astrocytic processes come in close vicinity of the nodes. Researchers declare that these processes stem from multi-functional astrocytes, as opposed to from a population of astrocytes dedicated to contacting the node. On the other hand, in the PNS, the basal lamina that surrounds the Schwann cells is continuous across the node. =Composition= The nodes of Ranvier contain Na+/K+ ATPases, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and high density of voltage-gated Na+ channels that generate action potentials. A sodium channel consists of a pore- forming Œ± subunit and two accessory Œ≤ subunits, which anchor the channel to extra-cellular and intra-cellular components. The nodes of Ranvier in the central and peripheral nervous systems mostly consist of Œ±NaV1.6 and Œ≤1 subunits. The extra-cellular region of Œ≤ subunits can associate with itself and other proteins, such as tenascin R and the cell-adhesion molecules neurofascin and contactin. Contactin is also present at nodes in the CNS and interaction with this molecule enhances the surface expression of Na+ channels. Ankyrin has been found to be bounded to Œ≤IV spectrin, a spectrin isoform enriched at nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segments. The PNS nodes are surrounded by Schwann cell microvilli, which contain ERMs and EBP50 that may provide a connection to actin microfilaments. Several extracellular matrix proteins are enriched at nodes of Ranvier, including tenascin-R, Bral-1, and proteoglycan NG2, as well as phosphacan and versican V2. At CNS nodes, the axonal proteins also include contactin; however, Schwann cell microvilli are replaced by astrocyte perinodal extensions. =Molecular organization= The molecular organization of the nodes corresponds to their specialized function in impulse propagation. The level of sodium channels in the node versus the internode suggests that the number IMPs corresponds to sodium channels. Potassium channels are essentially absent in the nodal axolemma, whereas they are highly concentrated in the paranodal axolemma and Schwann cell membranes at the node. The exact function of potassium channels have not quite been revealed, but it is known that they may contribute to the rapid repolarization of the action potentials or play a vital role in buffering the potassium ions at the nodes. This highly asymmetric distribution of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels is in striking contrast to their diffuse distribution in unmyelinated fibers.Black, J.A., Sontheimer, H., Oh, Y., and Waxman, S.G. (1995). _In The Axon_ , S. Waxman, J. Kocsis, and P. Stys, eds. Oxford University Press, New York, pp. 116‚Äì143. The filamentous network subjacent to the nodal membrane contains cytoskeletal proteins called spectrin and ankyrin. The high density of ankyrin at the nodes may be functionally significant because several of the proteins that are populated at the nodes share the ability to bind to ankyrin with extremely high affinity. All of these proteins, including ankyrin, are enriched in the initial segment of axons which suggests a functional relationship. Now the relationship of these molecular components to the clustering of sodium channels at the nodes is still not known. Although some cell-adhesion molecules have been reported to be present at the nodes inconsistently; however, a variety of other molecules are known to be highly populated at the glial membranes of the paranodal regions where they contribute to its organization and structural integrity. Development =Myelination of nerve fibers= The complex changes that the Schwann cell undergoes during the process of myelination of peripheral nerve fibers have been observed and studied by many. The initial envelopment of the axon occurs without interruption along the entire extent of the Schwann cell. This process is sequenced by the in-folding of the Schwann cell surface so that a double membrane of the opposing faces of the in-folded Schwann cell surface is formed. This membrane stretches and spirally wraps itself over and over as the in-folding of the Schwann cell surface continues. As a result, the increase in the thickness of the extension of the myelin sheath in its cross- sectional diameter is easily ascertained. It is also evident that each of the consecutive turns of the spiral increases in size along the length of the axon as the number of turns increase. However, it is not clear whether or not the increase in length of the myelin sheath can be accounted solely by the increase in length of axon covered by each successive turn of the spiral, as previously explained. At the junction of two Schwann cells along an axon, the directions of the lamellar overhang of the myelin endings are of opposite sense. This junction, adjacent of the Schwann cells, constitutes the region designated as the node of Ranvier. =Early stages= Researchers prove that in the developing CNS, Nav1.2 is initially expressed at all forming nodes Ranvier. Upon maturation, nodal Nav1.3 is down-regulated and replaced by Nav1.6. Naz1.2 is also expressed during PNS node formation, which suggests that the switching of Nav-channel subtypes is a general phenomenon in the CNS and PNS. In this same investigation, it was shown that Nav1.6 and Nav1.2 colocalize at many nodes of Ranvier during early myelination. This also led to the suggestion that early clusters of Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 channels are destined to later become nodes of Ranvier. Neurofascin is also reported to be one of the first proteins to accumulate at newly forming nodes of Ranvier. They are also found to provide the nucleation site for attachment of ankyrin G, Nav channels, and other proteins. The recent identification of the Schwann cell microvilli protein gliomedin as the likely binding partner of axonal neurofascin brings forward substantial evidence for the importance of this protein in recruiting Nav channels to the nodes of Ranvier. Furthermore, Lambert et al. and Eshed et al. also indicates that neurofascin accumulates before Nav channels and is likely to have crucial roles in the earliest events associated with node of Ranvier formation. Thus, multiple mechanisms may exist and work synergistically to facilitate clustering of Nav channels at nodes of Ranvier. =Nodal formation= The first event appears to be the accumulation of cell adhesion molecules such as NF186 or NrCAM. The intra-cellular regions of these cell-adhesion molecules interact with ankyrin G, which serves as an anchor for sodium channels. At the same time, the periaxonal extension of the glial cell wraps around the axon, giving rise to the paranodal regions. This movement along the axon contributes significantly to the overall formation of the nodes of Ranvier by permitting heminodes formed at the edges of neighboring glial cells to fuse into complete nodes. Septate-like junctions form at the paranodes with the enrichment of NF155 in glial paranodal loops. Immediately following the early differentiation of the nodal and paranodal regions, potassium channels, Caspr2 and TAG1 accumulate in the juxta-paranodal regions. This accumulation coincides directly with the formation of compact myelin. In mature nodal regions, interactions with the intracellular proteins appear vital for the stability of all nodal regions. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes do not possess microvilli, but appear capable to initiate the clustering of some axonal proteins through secreted factors. The combined effects of such factors with the subsequent movements generated by the wrapping of oligodendrocyte periaxonal extension could account for the organization of CNS nodes of Ranvier. Function =Action potential= An action potential is a spike of both positive and negative ionic discharge that travels along the membrane of a cell. The creation and conduction of action potentials represents a fundamental means of communication in the nervous system. Action potentials represent rapid reversals in voltage across the plasma membrane of axons. These rapid reversals are mediated by voltage-gated ion channels found in the plasma membrane. The action potential travels from one location in the cell to another, but ion flow across the membrane occurs only at the nodes of Ranvier. As a result, the action potential signal jumps along the axon, from node to node, rather than propagating smoothly, as they do in axons that lack a myelin sheath. The clustering of voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels at the nodes permits this behavior. =Saltatory conduction= Since an axon can be unmyelinated or myelinated, the action potential has two methods to travel down the axon. These methods are referred to as continuous conduction for unmyelinated axons, and saltatory conduction for myelinated axons. Saltatory conduction is defined as an action potential moving in discrete jumps down a myelinated axon. This process is outlined as the charge passively spreading to the next node of Ranvier to depolarize it to threshold which will then trigger an action potential in this region which will then passively spread to the next node and so on. Saltatory conduction provides one advantage over conduction that occurs along an axon without myelin sheaths. This is that the increased speed afforded by this mode of conduction assures faster interaction between neurons. On the other hand, depending on the average firing rate of the neuron, calculations show that the energetic cost of maintaining the resting potential of oligodendrocytes can outweigh the energy savings of action potentials. So, axon myelination does not necessarily save energy. Formation regulation =Paranode regulation via mitochondria accumulation= Mitochondria and other membranous organelles are normally enriched in the PNP region of peripheral myelinated axons, especially those large caliber axons. The actual physiological role of this accumulation and factors that regulate it are not understood; however, it is known that mitochondria are usually present in areas of the cell that expresses a high energy demand. In these same regions, they are also understood to contain growth cones, synaptic terminals, and sites of action potential initiation and regeneration, such as the nodes of Ranvier. In the synaptic terminals, mitochondria produce the ATP needed to mobilize vesicles for neurotransmission. In the nodes of Ranvier, mitochondria serve as an important role in impulse conduction by producing the ATP that is essential to maintain the activity of energy-demanding ion pumps. Supporting this fact, about five times more mitochondria are present in the PNP axoplasm of large peripheral axons than in the corresponding internodal regions of these fibers. =Nodal regulation= Via Œ±II-Spectrin Saltatory conduction in myelinated axons requires organization of the nodes of Ranvier, whereas voltage-gated sodium channels are highly populated. Studies show that Œ±II- Spectrin, a component of the cytoskeleton is enriched at the nodes and paranodes at early stages and as the nodes mature, the expression of this molecule disappears. It is also proven that Œ±II-Spectrin in the axonal cytoskeleton is absolutely vital for stabilizing sodium channel clusters and organizing the mature node of Ranvier. Possible regulation via the recognition molecule OMgp It has been shown previously that OMgp (oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein) clusters at nodes of Ranvier and may regulate paranodal architecture, node length and axonal sprounting at nodes. However, a follow-up study showed that the antibody used previously to identify OMgp at nodes crossreacts with another node-enriched component versican V2 and that OMgp is not required for the integrity of nodes and paranodes, arguing against the previously reported localization and proposed functions of OMgp at nodes. Clinical significance The proteins in these excitable domains of neuron when injured may result in cognitive disorders and various neuropathic ailments. History Louis Antoine Ranvier (1835‚Äì1922) The myelin sheath of long nerves was discovered and named by German pathological anatomist Rudolf Virchow in 1854. French pathologist and anatomist Louis-Antoine Ranvier later discovered the nodes, or gaps, in the myelin sheath that now bear his name. Born in Lyon, Ranvier was one of the most prominent histologists of the late 19th century. Ranvier abandoned pathological studies in 1867 and became an assistant of physiologist Claude Bernard. He was the chairman of General Anatomy at the Coll√®ge de France in 1875. His refined histological techniques and his work on both injured and normal nerve fibers became world-renowned. His observations on fiber nodes and the degeneration and regeneration of cut fibers had a great influence on Parisian neurology at the Salp√™tri√®re.

It was discovered in a cave at Brassempouy, France in 1892. About 25,000 years old, it is one of the earliest known realistic representations of a human face. Discovery Brassempouy is a small village in the d√©partement of Landes in southwest France. Two caves near the village, 100 metres from each other, were among the first Paleolithic sites to be explored in France. They are known as the Galerie des Hy√®nes (Gallery of the Hyenas) and the Grotte du Pape (the \\"Grotto of the Pope\\"). The Venus of Brassempouy was discovered in the Grotto of the Pope in 1894,For discussion of the nineteenth-century term Venus still applied to paleolithic female figures, see Venus figurines. accompanied by at least eight other human figures. These may be an example of unfinished work, as if the artist or artists carved several figurines at the same time. P. E. Dubalen first explored the Grotte du Pape during 1881, followed by J. de Laporterie and √âdouard Piette (1827‚Äì1906) from 1894 onwards. Since archaeological excavation techniques were then only starting to be developed, they paid little attention to the stratigraphy of the site containing the remains. In 1892 the site was pillaged and disturbed almost beyond reconstruction by a field visit of amateurs from the Association fran√ßaise pour l‚Äôavancement de la science.Described in detail by White 2006:257ff. Nevertheless, Piette described layers attributed to the late and middle Solutrean period. He termed the bottom levels he reached as √©burn√©en (pale or white like ivory), in reference to the copious amounts of ivory works which they contained. Modern reanalysis of the site has been performed under the direction of Henri Delporte during 1981‚Äì2000. In 1894, one of those strata, recognized now as Gravettian, yielded several fragments of statuettes, including the \\"Lady with the Hood\\". Piette considered the figures as closely related to the representations of animals of the Magdalenian period. He developed a hypothetical chronology that was later refuted by Henri Breuil. Description Front and side view of the Venus of Brassempouy. \\"La figurine √† la Ceinture\\" (The figurine with a belt), one of several Venus figurines discovered alongside the Venus of BrassempouyPiette, E., Laporterie J., 1894: Les fouilles de Brassempouy en 1894, Bulletins de la Soci√©t√© d'anthropologie de Paris, IV¬∞ S√©rie, tome 5, 1894. pp. 633-648. The Venus of Brassempouy was carved from mammoth ivory. According to archaeologist Paul Bahn the head is \\"unsexed, although it is usually called a 'Venus' or a 'lady'\\". The head is 3.65 cm high, 2.2 cm deep and 1.9 cm wide. The face is triangular and seems tranquil. While forehead, nose and brows are carved in relief, the mouth is absent. A vertical crack on the right side of the face is a consequence of the internal structure of the ivory. On the head is a checkerboard-like pattern formed by two series of shallow incisions at right angles to each other; it has been interpreted as a wig, a hood with geometric decoration, or simply a representation of hair. Randall White observed in the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory (December 2006), \\"The figurines emerged from the ground into a colonial intellectual and socio-political context nearly obsessed with matters of race.\\"Randall White, \\"The women of Brassempouy: A century of research and interpretation\\", Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory, Vol. 13, No.4, Dec 2006:251ff PDF file Although the style of representation is essentially realistic, the proportions of the head do not correspond exactly to any known human population of the present or past. White has claimed that, since the mid-twentieth century, concerns of interpretative questions have changed from race to womanhood and fertility, . Date Although the head was discovered so early that its context could not be studied thoroughly, scholars agree that the Venus of Brassempouy belonged to an Upper Palaeolithic material culture, the Gravettian (29,000‚Äì22,000 BP). More precisely, they date the figurine to the Middle Gravettian period, with \\"Noailles\\" burins circa 26,000 to 24,000 BP.White 2006, 264. It is more or less contemporary with the other Palaeolithic Venus figurines, such as those of Lespugue, Doln√≠ Vƒõstonice, Willendorf, etc. Nonetheless, it is distinguished among the group by the realistic character of the representation. Display The Venus of Brassempouy is preserved in the Mus√©e d'Arch√©ologie Nationale at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near ParisInventory number 47 019. Since ivory is very susceptible to damage from factors such as temperature change, moisture, and light, the figure is not part of the Palaeolithic department, but is exhibited in the Salle Piette of the Museum, opened only by reservation. At Brassempouy, a variety of objects excavated in the Grotte du Pape are on display at the Maison de la Dame. This exhibition space, devoted primarily to regional archaeology, also displays a fine set of casts of palaeolithic sculptures. These include the nine existing specimens from Brassempouy, but also casts of the well-known figures from Lespugue, Willendorf and Doln√≠ Vƒõstonice, as well as the Mal'ta Venuses, and the Grimaldi Venuses. Stamp In 1976, the Venus of Brassempouy was depicted on a 2.00 franc stamp. It has also been the motif of a 15-franc (CFA) stamp of the Republic of Mali.

The district is anchored in Denton County, an affluent and fast-growing suburban county north of Dallas and Fort Worth. In 2002, he defeated Scott Armey, the son of House Majority Leader and then-U.S. Representative Dick Armey, in a primary runoff election. Prior to his election, he practiced as a doctor of obstetrics and gynecology. Burgess is a member of the congressional Tea Party Caucus, and he has been involved in the debates over health care reform and energy policy. He opposes abortion, is unsure of the extent of the contribution of human activity to global warming, supports President Donald Trump's restrictions on travel from Muslim-majority countries and refugee immigration, and supports the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Burgess is a strong supporter of President Trump's immigration policies. In June 2019 he argued, in response to media reports of around 250 migrant children being kept in unsanitary and inhumane conditions by US officials in a warehouse by the US-Mexico border as a result of the Trump administration's family separation policy, that the children were not actually being detained against their will: \\"You know what? There's not a lock on the door. Any child is free to leave at anytime, but they don't. You know why? Because they are well taken care of.\\" Early life, education, and medical career Michael Burgess was born in Rochester, Minnesota, the son of Norma (n√©e Crowhurst) and Harry Meredith Burgess; his paternal family immigrated from Nova Scotia, a province of Canada. He graduated from North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) in 1972 and graduated from the medical school at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston in 1977. He completed a residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas. Burgess is an Anglican. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= Burgess, who had never held any public office and voted in the Democratic primaries in 1990, 1992, and 1994, entered in the 2002 Republican primary election to replace U.S. Congressman and House Majority Leader Dick Armey. His primary opponent was Armey's son, Scott. The district, comprising almost all of Denton County (except a sliver in the southeast), was strongly Republican, and political pundits had predicted that whoever won the primary would not only win the general election, but be assured of at least a decade in Congress. Using the campaign slogan \\"My dad is NOT Dick Armey\\", Burgess touted the support of medical Political Action Committees and organizations like the National Beer Wholesalers Association. Burgess took second place in the primary behind Armey, finishing with 23% of the vote to Armey's 45%. Since neither candidate earned the required majority of votes, the election led to a primary runoff election. Before the runoff, The Dallas Morning News released a series of articles alleging that Armey used his influence as a judge to procure county jobs and contracts for his friends. The report hurt Armey's campaign, and Burgess won the runoff with 55% of the vote. He won the general election with 75% of the vote. Burgess has won re-election seven times: *66% in 2004 *60% in 2006 *60% in 2008 *67% in 2010 *68% in 2012 *nearly 84% in 2014 (for the first time, Burgess did not draw a Democratic challenger, and ran against nominal Libertarian opposition) Burgess won his eighth term in the U.S. House in the general election held on November 8, 2016. With 211,730 (66.4 percent) votes, he defeated the Democrat Eric Mauck and the Libertarian Mark Boler, who polled 94,507 (29.6 percent) and 12,843 (4 percent), respectively. Burgess secured his ninth term in the general election held on November 6, 2018. With 185,268 votes (59.4 percent), he defeated his Democratic opponent, Linsey Fagan, who polled 121,584 votes (39 percent). Another 5,008 votes (1.6 percent) went to the Libertarian choice, Mark Boler, who also ran in 2016. =Tenure= Rep. Burgess speaks to Senators John Kerry and John McCain in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol before the 2011 State of the Union Address A member of the Republican Party and Tea Party caucus, Burgess is considered to be a conservative member of the House of Representatives. Through 2011, he had a lifetime rating of 93.59 percent from the American Conservative Union. Burgess is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge, wherein the signer pledges to: Impeachment of Obama On August 9, 2011, Burgess met with a Tea Party group in Keller, Texas to discuss his vote to raise the debt ceiling. When a constituent asked if the House of Representatives was considering impeaching President Barack Obama, Burgess responded, \\"It needs to happen, and I agree with you it would tie things up ...

Burgess supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim- majority countries, stating that Trump was \\"well within his authority\\" to issue the order and that \\"Congress should remain involved in the process and provide legislation to strengthen not only border security but vetting those who wish to enter the country through any means.\\" Healthcare Burgess is one of nine medical doctors in Congress, and one of seven in the House of Representatives. In May 2009, Congressional Quarterly noted that Burgess had \\"become a prominent voice on health care issues\\" in the U.S. House. Since the 111th United States Congress, he has chaired the Congressional Health Care caucus, of which he is the only official member. Burgess supports the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as the ACA or Obamacare. At the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference, Burgess said he favored covering fewer Americans with health insurance. Burgess said, \\"If the numbers drop, I would say that's a good thing, because we've restored personal liberty in this country.\\"  Energy and the environment  As a member of the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power, Burgess has been active in the debate over energy policy. In 2011, he submitted an amendment to the 2012 Energy and Water Appropriations Act to defund part of the act that established higher efficiency standards for household light bulbs. However, Burgess' claims that the standards represented a \\"ban\\" on conventional lightbulbs were rated as \\"Mostly False\\" by the fact checking website PolitiFact.com. On April 30, 2015, Burgess once again introduced an amendment to the $35.4 billion fiscal 2016 energy and water spending bill which would defund the Department of Energy enforcement of incandescent light bulb efficiency standards, a measure which passed 232‚Äì189, largely on a party line vote Marcos, Christina \\"House adopts proposal to halt incandescent light bulb standards\\", The Hill, May 01, 2015, Retrieved May 3, 2015 Burgess denies the scientific consensus on climate change.

The resolution passed overwhelmingly on a vote of 371‚Äì18. The FBI has identified the movement as a domestic terrorism threat. BuzzFeed reported earlier this week that followers of QAnon targeted the resolution's author, New Jersey Democratic U.S. Rep. Tom Malinowski, with death threats. Malinowski's resolution condemned and rejected the conspiracy theories the movement promotes and included a list of crimes in which the perpetrators cited QAnon as a guiding inspiration. The resolution additionally pointed to FBI and U.S. military warnings about the movement's potential to foment political tension and radicalization. =Legislation= On February 25, 2014, Burgess introduced the Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act (H.R. 4080; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize funding for public and private entities that provide trauma and emergency care services and for the administration of the Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS). =Committee assignments= * Committee on Rules  Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process * Committee on Energy and Commerce  Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection  Subcommittee on Health (Chair)  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations =Caucus memberships= * Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus Works * See also * Physicians in US Congress References External links * Congressman Michael C.

Libertel was the second company in the Netherlands to get a license for offering GSM services (after PTT Telecom). The corporate structure started with a holding partnership named CV Gemeenschapplijk Bezit Libertel containing three wholly owned subsidiaries: Libertel Groep BV (the holding company), Libertel BV (the cellular network operator), and Liberfone BV (the service provider). The six original shareholders were ING, Vodafone, Vendex, Liof, Internatio-M√ºller, and Macintosh Retail Group. In early 1998, Vendex and Liof both sold their shares for 120 million guilders. Internatio-M√ºller and Macintosh each sold their shares for 48 million guilders.

Cramer. Publication history The novel was first published in June 1997 in hardcover and trade paperback formats by Avon Books. The company followed up by publishing a mass-market paperback version in 1998. The novel is currently out of print. Plot The plot revolves around three central human characters, George Griffin, Roger Coulton, and Alice Lang. Set from 1987 to 2004, the book details the efforts of physicists George and Roger as they work to bring the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) online in Waxahachie, Texas. Alice is a novelist, working on her latest horror work, who becomes involved as she researches material for her book at the SSC. She and George fall in love just as preliminary trial runs of the SSC produce an unexplained phenomenon: a Snark, to borrow an expression from Lewis Carroll, or an impossible event, in the form of a heavy particle which emerged from the planned head-on collision between two 20 TeV protons inside the SSC. In addition to violating physical laws such as the conservation of mass, this particle emits pulses of radioactivity, spelling out the numerical prime number sequence of 2-3-5-7-11-13-17-19-23-29-31-37. Therein begins the unraveling of an even greater mystery than the particle itself: a powerful intelligence is behind this event, seeking to communicate with Humankind, which has unwittingly announced itself to the universe through the powerful bursts of energy unleashed with the collisions of particles within the SSC. For a time, this first contact is made by a benevolent species. Another species is also working to make contact‚Äîa less benevolent species, whose intent may ultimately destroy the Earth and perhaps even the fabric of the universe. The plot does not take place in our timeline but in an alternative history‚Äîone in which the Superconducting Super Collider was built in Texas. In reality, the project was cancelled in 1993 and never implemented. In this alternate history, American forces invaded Baghdad and overthrew Saddam Hussein after liberating Kuwait during the Gulf War (1990-1991), leading to George H. W. Bush's re-election in 1992 over Bill Clinton. The sinister significance of all this, and the relation of this alternative history to ours, become clear in the last part of the book.

Biography  After high school Roberts went to college in Utah for fashion and design, but quit after 2 years and took a job in retail management in Los Angeles, California. It was during this time that she met Dayton, another pornstar and through her learned about the adult business. Roberts met her at the Key Club in Hollywood, which was well known by the locals for its live music. Dayton worked as a contract star for Vivid Entertainment and took Roberts in to meet with an executive of the firm. Because Vivid had been bought out by Hustler Entertainment, they told her that they weren't interested. Dayton introduced her to some other friends, and through those introductions she was able to get work with the porn producers at Metro Interactive. In late 2000 and early 2001 she made three movies for them, Wild Cherries, All Teens Love Cum 1 and All Fucked Up, but she was not happy with the quality of the movies or her working conditions. As a result, she almost quit the adult business altogether. Roberts met former pornstar Jill Kelly, who had just started her own movie studio and was looking for new talent, and Kelly hired her for a role in her new movie Immortal, starring alongside Devon (who had recently left Vivid as well) and long time industry veteran Asia Carrera. This was the first time Roberts met Devon and they formed a friendship that would eventually become a business partnership with Roberts's own company. After working for Jill Kelly, Roberts did some movies for other companies such as Odyssey, Evil Angel and Digital Sin. In 2002, she secured a two-year deal with VCA Pictures. The deal wasn't successful financially, and, within a few months she wanted out. A friend of hers suggested she give Vivid another try. Roberts got out of her contract with VCA and signed a two-year contract with Vivid that included six movies a year. Her first three films for Vivid won her critical acclaim, all gaining the highest reviewer ratings, including Most Beautiful Girl in the World, Unlovable, and Dual Identity.

Career Hinson worked on the U.S. House staff as a doorman in 1967, and then served on the staffs of representatives Charles H. Griffin, a Democrat, and Thad Cochran, a Republican. In 1978, Cochran ran successfully for the United States Senate, and Hinson was elected to succeed Cochran in the House. With 51.6 percent of the vote, Hinson defeated the Democrat John Hampton Stennis, the son of U.S. senator John C. Stennis, who finished with 26.4 percent of the vote. The remaining ballots were cast for independent candidates. Sexual orientation Prior to his 1978 candidacy for the U.S. House, Hinson survived a fire on October 24, 1977, at the Washington, D.C., Gay Cinema Follies. Firefighters found him under a pile of bodies; he was one of only four men rescued. In 1980, Hinson admitted that in 1976, while an aide to Cochran, he had been arrested for committing an obscene actAssociated Press after he exposed himself to an undercover policeman at the Iwo Jima Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery. Hinson then denied that he was homosexual and blamed his problems on alcoholism. He also said that he had reformed and refused to yield to demands that he resign. He won re- election on November 4, 1980, with a plurality of 38.97 percent of the vote. The Independent Leslie B. McLemore polled 29.8 percent, and Democrat Britt Singletary received 29.4 percent. Hinson, who was married, was arrested again on February 4, 1981, and charged with attempted sodomy for performing oral sex on a male employee of the Library of Congress in a restroom of the House of Representatives. After the investigation, he was charged with sodomy. At the time, homosexual acts, even between consenting adults, were a criminal offense. The charge was a felony that could have resulted in up to ten years in prison and fines of up to $10,000. Since both parties were consenting adults (and social attitudes were changing), the United States attorney's office reduced the charge to a misdemeanor. Facing a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $1,000 fine, Hinson pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted sodomy the following day and was released without bail pending a trial scheduled for May 4, 1981. Soon thereafter, he checked himself into a District of Columbia‚Äìarea hospital for professional care. Hinson later received a 30-day jail sentence, which was suspended, and a year's probation, on condition that he continue counseling and treatment. Resignation and later life Hinson resigned on April 13, 1981, just three months into his second term in the House. He said that his resignation had been \\"the most painful and difficult decision of my life.\\" He was succeeded by Democrat Wayne Dowdy, who won the special election held in the summer of 1981. Soon afterward, Hinson acknowledged that he was homosexual and became an activist for gay rights. He later helped to organize the lobbying group \\"Virginians for Justice\\" and fought against the ban on gays in the military. He also was a founding member of the Fairfax Lesbian and Gay Citizens Association in Fairfax County, Virginia. He never returned to Mississippi but lived in the Washington area, first in Alexandria, Virginia, and then Silver Spring, Maryland. Death Hinson died of respiratory failure resulting from AIDS in Silver Spring, Maryland, at the age of fifty-three. Hinson's body was cremated. The ashes were buried in his native Tylertown, Mississippi, after a private service. By then divorced from his wife Cynthia, Hinson was survived by a brother, Robert Hinson of Gulfport, Mississippi.

It is a rapidly growing sector of the construction and civil engineering industry. It can be defined as \\"a family of methods, materials, and equipment capable of being used for the installation of new or replacement or rehabilitation of existing underground infrastructure with minimal disruption to surface traffic, business, and other activities.\\" Trenchless & construction Trenchless construction includes such construction methods as tunneling, microtunneling (MTM), horizontal directional drilling (HDD) also known as directional boring, pipe ramming (PR), pipe jacking (PJ), moling, horizontal auger boring (HAB) and other methods for the installation of pipelines and cables below the ground with minimal excavation. Large diameter tunnels such as those constructed by a tunnel boring machine (TBM), and drilling and blasting techniques are larger versions of subsurface construction. The difference between trenchless and other subsurface construction techniques depends upon the size of the passage under construction. The method requires considering soil characteristics and the loads applied to the surface. In cases where the soil is sandy, the water table is at shallow depth, or heavy loads like that of urban traffic are expected, the depth of excavation has to be such that the pressure of the load on the surface does not affect the bore, otherwise there is a danger of the surface caving in. Trenchless rehabilitation Pipe replacement by pipe bursting Trenchless rehabilitation includes such construction methods as sliplining, thermoformed pipe, pipe bursting, shotcrete, gunite, cured-in- place pipe (CIPP), grout-in-place pipe, mechanical spot repair, and other methods for the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of existing buried pipes and structures without excavation, or at least with minimal excavation. Mechanical spot repair is applied where damaged pipelines require the reinstatement of structural integrity. Sliplining, CIPP, and thermoformed pipe lining involve pulling or inverting a new liner into an existing pipe, then applying heat and/or pressure to force the liner to expand to fill the pipe. CIPP technologies combine a carrier (felt or fibreglass) impregnated with heat, ultraviolet light, or ambient curable resin to form a \\"pipe within a pipe\\". Pipe bursting fractures a pipe from the inside and forces the fragments outwards while a new pipe is drawn in to replace the old. The other methods are primarily for fixing spot leaks. Trenchless rehabilitation methods are generally more cost-effective than traditional exhume (dig) and replace methods. Trade associations The trenchless technology industry is represented by several industry associations in addition to standing committees within almost every water and sewer related industry association. The International Society for Trenchless Technology, established in 1986, has 25 active national trenchless technology societies associated with it. In the US, The National Association of Sewer Service Companies (NASSCO) was established in 1976 and is the oldest such association with a trenchless focus. The North American Society for Trenchless Technology (NASTT) was established in 1990. In India, the Indian Society for Trenchless Technology or IndSTT is the apex organization to promote trenchless technology in South Asia. It was established in 1995 with its head office at New Delhi. No Dig India is the official Journal of IndSTT. Several organizations bring out technical Journals for sensitizing the readers about such techniques.

Together with the closely related reedbucks, waterbucks, lechwe, Nile lechwe, and puku, it forms the Reduncinae tribe. Found along the northern savanna, it is often seen in Murchison Falls and Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda; Garamba and Virunga National Park, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as grassy floodplains of South Sudan. Kob are found in wet areas (such as floodplains), where they eat grasses. Kob are diurnal, but inactive during the heat of the day. They live in groups of either females and calves or just males. These groups generally range from five to 40 animals. Among the kobs of eastern Africa, the Ugandan kob (Kobus kob thomasi) appears on the coat of arms of Uganda, and white-eared kobs (Kobus kob leucotis), found in South Africa, southwest Ethiopia, and extreme northeast Uganda, participate in large-scale migrations. Description Uganda kob at Murchison Falls NP The kob resembles the impala but is more heavily built. However, males are more robust than females and have horns.Kingdon, J. (1982). East African Mammals: An Atlas of Evolution in Africa, Volume 3, Part. C: Bovids. University Chicago Press, Chicago 367-381. Males have shoulder heights of and an average weight of . Females have shoulder heights of and weigh on average . The pelage of the kob is typically golden to reddish-brown overall, but with the throat patch, eye ring, and inner ear being white, and the forelegs being black at the front. Males get darker as they get older. Those of the white-eared kob (K. k. leucotis), which is found in the Sudd region (the easternmost part of their range), are strikingly different and overall dark, rather similar to the male Nile lechwe, though with a white throat and no pale patch from the nape to the shoulder. Both sexes have well-developed inguinal glands that secrete a yellow, waxy substance, as well as preorbital glands. Range The kob is currently found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Sudan, Togo, and Uganda. It was formerly also found in Gambia, Kenya, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania, but is now extinct in those areas. Ecology The kob's distribution from western Africa to central East Africa is patchy. It inhabits flat areas and open country close to permanent water, with consistent climate. It drinks daily and requires fresh grazing. During the rains, kob frequent short grasses and keep them short. Since it is dependent on water, the kob does not wander far into arid areas. Kob gather on and move from one pasture to another, coinciding with seasonal changes. In flooded areas, they may travel hundreds of kilometers, and dry-season walks to water may take 10 km or more. Grasses preferred by kobs are Hyparrhenia species, Brachiaria brizantha, Setaria gayanus, Chloris gayana, and Echinochloa and Digitaria spp.Bindernagel, J. A. (1968) Game cropping in Uganda. Canadian International Development Agency, Ottawa. Social behavior and life history Female Kob can live in herds numbering in the thousands. They move more and are more social than territorial males. Females are at the front of the daily movements to water. Individuals learn where to go from their mothers. However, in larger herds, the females take their signals from other females. Males are also present in the migratory herds and follow the females. All-male herds may number in the hundreds and accompany females as they travel during dry season. Gathering of kobs at Murchison Falls National Park The social and reproductive organization of kob can vary. When in average or low population densities, males establish conventional territories and do not travel much. Adult males try to establish their territories in the best habitat available, which are inhabited by herds of females and their young. Herds are fluid and change in size and structure as individuals travel to find green vegetation. Other males, particularly young males, live in bachelor herds and are segregated from the females by the territorial males. On floodplains, where kob are densely populated, around two-thirds of the territorial males establish traditional territories, while the rest live in clustered territories known as leks. These clusters are sometimes smaller than a single traditional territory. Lek clusters are located on patches of short grass or bare ground within comparably tall grassland. As such, these territories have little to no value other than to the males that reside in them. About eight or 9 of every 10 females visit leks to mate, trading spacing and food for mating success. The kob tends to live in smaller herds consisting of 5 to 15 individual kob, but herds as many as 40+ have been observed. Females and bachelor males live in large herds of up to 2000 and move through the leks, which are surrounded by high-quality grass and are near waterholes and commonly travelled routes. Kob at C√¥te d'Ivoire Conflicts between territorial Ugandan kob (K. k. thomasi) are usually settled with ritual and rarely actual fighting, whether in conventional territories or leks. A male usually needs only to walk in an erect posture towards the intruder to displace him.Buechner, H. K., Schleoth, R. K., (1965) Ceremonial mating behavior in Uganda kob (Adenota kob thomsi Neuman). Z. Tierpsychol, 22:209-25. Neighboring males in leks do the same thing when they encounter their borders. Lek-holding white-eared kobs fight more often.Fryxell, J. (1985) Resource limitation and population ecology of white-eared kob. Ph.D thesis, Univ. of British Columbia. Ugandan kob do sometimes sustain serious or fatal injuries, especially when control of a territory is at stake. Fights usually involve the combatants clashing, pressing and twisting each other with their horns head-on. However, a neighbor may attack from the rear or side. In lek clusters, the most dominant males occupy the center. The number of males in the center of a lek cluster ranges from three to seven, and their leks are the most clustered and they monopolize copulations with estrous females.Floody, O. R., Arnold , A. P., (1975) Uganda kob (Adenota kob thomasi). Territoriality and the spatial distribution of sexual and agonistic behavior at a territorial ground. Z. Tierpsychol, 37:192-212. Replacement of males in leks are much more common than in traditional territories, and most males are able to stay in the centre positions for only a day or two and rarely up to a week. This is largely due to intense competition and because most males leave their territories to feed and drink. Centrally located males reduce their chances of being replaced by leaving to feed during periods of relative calmness, yet they are not able to get enough food and water and have to eventually leave their leks. However, a male can gain enough energy after a week or two, and try to take back his position. At every lek cluster, males are always waiting take or retake a central lek. Males in traditional territories are able to stay for at least a year or two. Females have their first ovulation at 13‚Äì14 months of age and have 20- to 26-day intervals between estrous cycles until they are fertilized. Males from traditional territories and leks have different courtship strategies. Males of traditional territories will herd females and keep them in their territories. Lek males try to do the same, but usually fail. They have to rely on advertising themselves. Kob courtship may last as short as two minutes, and copulation may only last a few seconds. At leks, a female may mate up to 20 times with at least one of the central males in a day. After an eight-month gestation period and giving birth, estrus may commence 21‚Äì64 days later. For their first month, calves hide in dense vegetation. Mother and calf can identify each other by their noses. As they get older, calves gather into cr√®ches. When they are three to four months old, the young enter the females' herds and stay with mothers until six to seven months, by which time they are weaned. When they mature, males join bachelors groups. Status The white-eared kob (K. k. leucotis) is a dark subspecies from the Sudd and nearby regions Kob populations have been reduced by hunting and human development. The Uganda kob (Kobus kob thomasi) became extinct in southwestern Kenya and northwestern Tanzania due to the expansion of human settlements and agriculture. However, there are sizeable populations of this subspecies in Murchison Falls and Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda and Garamba and Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Buffon's kob (Kobus kob kob) is protected in several parks, including Niokolo-Koba in Senegal, Como√© in C√¥te d'Ivoire, Arly-Singou in Burkina Faso, Mole and Bui in Ghana, Pendjari in Benin, Waza, B√©nou√© and Faro National Parks of the North Province of Cameroon, Zakouma in Chad, and Manovo-Gounda-St. Floris and Sangba in the Central African Republic. Once feared almost extinct because of the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983‚Äì2005), surveys in 2007 and later confirmed that several hundred thousand white-eared kobs (Kobus kob leucotis) survive. Together with tiang and Mongalla gazelles, they participate in one of the largest mammal migrations on Earth, numbering about 1.2 million individuals in total. The white-eared kob is protected in Boma National Park and Bandingilo National Park in South Sudan, and Gambella National Park in Ethiopia.

Spiral Zone was animated by Japanese studio Visual 80 as well as South Korean studio AKOM. Based in part from a toy line made by Japanese company Bandai, the series focused on an international group of soldiers fighting to free the world from a scientist who controls much of the Earth's surface. It only ran for one season, with a total count of 65 episodes. Tonka acquired the license from Bandai and created a different treatment to the series, plus a short-lived toy line.  Plot  In the year 2007, a brilliant but twisted military scientist named Dr. James Bent uses a neon military space shuttle to drop his deadly Zone Generators across half of the Earth, thus creating a region called the Spiral Zone due to its shape. Millions of people are trapped in the dark mists of the Spiral Zone and transformed into \\"Zoners\\" with lifeless yellow eyes and strange red patches on their skin. Because they have no will to resist, Dr. James Bent - now known as Overlord - makes them his slave army and controls them from the Chrysler Building in New York City. His followers are known as the Black Widows: Bandit, Duchess Dire, Razorback, Reaper, Crook, and Raw Meat. They are immune to the mind-altering effects of the Zone because of a special device called the Widow Maker. However, due to prolonged exposure to the Zone, they display the same physical effects to their bodies as normal people caught inside the Zone, which has dark skies and Zone spores growing in many places. Overlord seeks to conquer the world by bringing everyone under control with the Zone Generators. The Zones feed off human energy, which is why Overlord does not kill anyone inside. With major cities Zoned, the nations of the world put aside their own differences to fight the Black Widows. However, only five soldiers using special suits to protect themselves from the Zone could do it. While easy to destroy, Zone Generators are impossible to capture because of booby traps. Overlord would also drop more generators on remaining military and civilian centers and force the Zone Riders into a standoff.  Characters  =Black Widows= Bent not only invented the Zone Generators but also an antidote process giving him immunity to the bacteria. He uses this process on his small group of soldiers. While immune to the mind-altering effects, each Black Widow still has lesions on their skin and have yellow dilated eyes. * Overlord (Dr. James Bent) - commander and rebel scientist. * Bandit (information unknown) - master of disguise, a terrorist of Middle Eastern origin. * Duchess Dire (Ursula Dire) - a charming woman of British nationality, she is an assignment expert, hardened criminal, and Overlord's mistress.Spiral Zone S1 E14 * Razorback (Al Krak) - bladesman. * Reaper (Mathew Riles) - manhunter. * Crook (Jean Duprey) - French Scientist who tricks Reaper into becoming immune to the spiral zone in the episode \\" Shall You Reaper.\\" * Raw Meat (Richard Welt) - a truck driver who got tricked through Bandit in episode called \\" Bandit and the Smokies \\". =Black Widow vehicles= Overlord rides the Bullwhip Cannon, an eight-wheel all-terrain vehicle equipped with a large laser cannon. The other Black Widows ride Sledge Hammers, a one-man minitank that has triangular caterpillar tracks and has whirling mace arms on either side. They also have a special delta-winged aircraft called the Intruder. =Zone Riders= Overlord's initial strike put all the major capitals of the world in the Zone. The chaos sparks international cooperation even between the United States and the Soviet Union. To counter the effects of the Zone bacteria, British scientists create a rare material called Neutron-90. However, only a limited amount of Neutron-90 is remaining in the world after the British government orders the destruction of the only laboratory where the material is produced.Spiral Zone episode 4, Mission Into Evil There is only enough material left to build combat suits for five specially-trained soldiers called the Spiral Force, also known as the \\"Zone Riders.\\" * Cdr Dirk Courage - Zone Riders leader, United States * MSgt Tank Schmidt - heavy weapons specialist, West Germany * Lt Hiro Taka - infiltration specialist, Japan * 2nd Lt Max Jones - special mission expert, United States * Cpl Katerina Anastacia - medical officer, USSR As the series advances, the Zone Riders discover that there is still enough Neutron-90 left over from assembling the five suits, sufficient to build two additional suits. They are issued to Australian demolition specialist Lt Ned Tucker and field scientist Lt Benjamin Davis Franklin. =Zone Rider vehicles= The Zone Riders are deployed around the world from a mountain base called the Mission Command Central, or MCC. Dirk Courage rides the Rimfire, a monowheel vehicle equipped with a large cannon on top. The other Zone Riders ride armored combat monocycles and wear special backpacks.

Conceptualized by Gundam mecha designers Kunio Okawara and Kazuhisa Kondo, the Special Force Group Spiral Zone series depicted a team of special operations soldiers fighting a war in the early 21st century. The line only had 12 items, organized into Acts. They include: three 1:12 scale six-inch figures with full equipment codenamed Bull Solid, Hyper Boxer, and Sentinel Bear, two Bull Solid cloth uniform and armor sets, two Hyper Boxer cloth uniform and armor sets, two equipment backpacks, two bare human figures, and one vehicle called the Monoseed. The figures had 30 points of articulation. Non-toy media included a notebook, a novel, and a LP/story compilation released in 1986 by Warner Bros. Records and Pioneer Corporation called a Hyper Image Album. The LP disc in particular contains songs composed by Toshiyuki Watanabe and performed by Tomoko Aran, with the accompanying stories written by Kazunori It≈ç. He wrote the novel with HEADGEAR colleague Akemi Takada as illustrator. The series' story and other machines, such as a mobile base and special transport for the Monoseeds, were also detailed in Bandai's Model Making Journal.Bandai Model Making Journal, October 1985Bandai Model Making Journal, June 1986 Bandai had plans to release a fourth action figure (codenamed Fireball) and additional vehicles before the line was cancelled. They include a tank, a small flight pod called the Beaufighter, a radio-controlled assault jeep resembling the Chenowth DPV called the Fat Lynx, a fast-attack vehicle called the Mad Lemming, a bipedal mech, two personal transport backpacks, and the Monoseed Mk II assault cycle, among others. The Monoseed and Monoseed Mk II were the respective basis for the Zone Riders' standard motorcycles and Courage's Rimfire Cannon, while one of the two unreleased backpacks, a monocycle called the Monodrive, was remodeled as Max Jones' Zone Runner backpack.http://spiral- zone.com/bandai/prototypes.htm The unreleased vehicles later appeared in the series' gashapon line, which also had a special Spiral Zone super-deformed board game and other products not developed in 1:12 scale, such as new personal mecha units, weapon packs, and three figures (codenamed Zone Bolt, Eagle Eye, and Zone Acorn).http://spiral-zone.com/bandai/sd_toys.htm Because of their extensive detail and high-quality construction, the Japanese Spiral Zone figures are well regarded among toy collectors and often fetch high prices. The American Spiral Zone animated series was dubbed into Japanese and aired on the satellite network NHK-BS2 in 1990.http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm16789521 Japanese dub at Nico Nico Douga (account required for viewing) The episode order for the Japanese broadcast was substantially altered from the order used in the United States. For example, US episode #1 was aired in Japan as episode #3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX0l5_GHGmo Japanese dub of \\"Holographic Battle\\" on You Tube. However, the series' opening theme was left unaltered. The complete Japanese dubbed version of Spiral Zone was released on VHS format in Japan by NHK under their \\"VOOK\\" line in 1991 thru 1992. Releases =Toys= Although best known for producing toys of construction vehicles, Tonka licensed the rights to Spiral Zone from Bandai and created a line of seven-inch figures that were later based on the animated series. The toy line, which hit the market in 1986, comprised four of the five original Zone Riders and all five original Black Widows, plus their vehicles, six cloth uniforms, and six equipment sets. However, the cancellation of the series left the figures of Zone Riders Anastacia, Tucker, and Franklin, Black Widows Crook and Raw Meat, and a Zone Generator playset out of Tonka's 1988 release. The figures were also highly detailed, but were not as articulated as the Japanese figures. Each figure has a special audio cassette tape. =Home video= Tonka first released Spiral Zone on VHS in 1987 with two episodes per tape. Only three tapes were produced before the series was cancelled. Tonka has not announced plans to release the series on DVD. However, an unofficial DVD set containing all 65 episodes and bonus materials was released in late 2006 by Spiral-Zone.com, with the cooperation of the show's supervising director, Pierre de Celles. The site's operator said that de Celles volunteered for the project by providing the original master tapes of the series, which were converted to DVD. He added that Tonka and parent firm Hasbro never responded to his offers to acquire the rights. =Comics= DC Comics released a Spiral Zone four-issue limited series in February 1987. It was written by Michael Fleisher with art by veteran artist Carmine Infantino.http://www.comics.org/series/3619/ References  Sources  *SpiralZone.com: The #1 resource for both the Tonka and Bandai SPIRAL ZONE series (unofficial) *Reviews on the original Bandai Spiral Zone collection *Spiral Zone Toys info *Flashback Review: Spiral Zone  External links   1987 American television series debuts 1987 American television series endings 1980s American animated television series 1980s toys Action figures Post-apocalyptic animated television series 1980s American science fiction television series American children's animated science fiction television series Bandai brands Comics based on toys Comics by Michael Fleisher First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Orbis Communications Television series set in 2007 Tonka brands Works based on Bandai Namco video games English-language television shows ","title":"Spiral Zone"},{"id":"962277","text":"Quarterly Goods and services tax revenues ($millions) since 2000.

The idea of a broad-based consumption tax was again raised by federal treasurer Paul Keating at the 1985 Tax Summit, but was dropped at the behest of then Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke after pressure from the ACTU, welfare groups and business, which did not like its association with proposals for capital gains and fringe benefits taxes. The idea was revived in 1991 by the opposition Liberal- National Coalition led by Dr John Hewson, and GST was the centrepiece of the opposition's \\"Fightback!\\" platform at the 1993 election. The opposition had difficulty explaining the policy, as exemplified by Hewson's famous Birthday Cake Interview, and Labor prime minister Paul Keating's campaign exploited public distrust of GST, which was considered a factor in the opposition's surprise loss of the \\"unloseable\\" 1993 election. In 1994 the Liberals decided to discard the remnants of \\"Fightback!\\" and Alexander Downer replaced Hewson as Liberal leader. John Howard was re-elected leader of the Liberal party in 1995, and pledged \\"never, ever\\" to introduce GST.(25 August 2004). PM defends his credibility. PM. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved on 8 February 2015. Howard led the Liberal-National Coalition to a large victory in the 1996 federal election. However, following a decision of the High Court that franchise fees charged by the states on cigarettes, alcohol and fuel was unconstitutional, removing revenue from the states and territories, Howard saw the need for the states to have autonomy on a portion of their revenue. Before the 1998 election, Howard proposed GST that would replace all existing sales taxes, as well as applying to all goods and services. At the election, the Howard Government suffered a swing against it of 4.61% at the election, achieving a two-party-preferred vote of only 49.02%, compared with Labor on 50.98%. Nevertheless, the incumbent government retained a majority of seats in the lower house and Howard described the election win as a \\"mandate for GST\\". Lacking a Senate majority, and with Labor opposed to the introduction of GST, the government turned to the minor parties such as the Australian Democrats to gain the necessary support to get the necessary legislation through the Senate. A prominent selling point of the legislation was that all the revenue raised by GST would be distributed to the states. In 1999 an agreement was reached with the state and territory governments that their various duties, levies and taxes on consumption would be removed over time, with the consequent budget shortfall being replaced by GST income distributed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Furthermore, federally levied personal income tax and company tax was reduced to offset GST. During the 1998 election campaign, the leader of the Australian Democrats, Meg Lees, stated that her party was opposed to GST unless food, books and tourism packages sold offshore were exempt, and other compensating tax measures were implemented. The government initially stated that exemptions to GST were not possible, and looked most likely to pass the GST legislation with the support of independent Senator Brian Harradine but Harradine ultimately voted against the legislation. However a compromise was eventually reached with Lees, involving most basic food items being exempt from GST, the GST on library purchases of books being refunded, a temporary 8% refund on school textbooks, increases to welfare payments, and greater powers to the ACCC to oversee the implementation of the new tax regime. A proposal to exempt tampons from GST was dismissed by Howard.(25 January 2000). AM Archive - Howard rules out GST changes. AM. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved 8 February 2015. The legislation was passed on 28 June 1999 as A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act (Cth) 1999. It gained assent on 8 July 1999 and came into operation on 1 July 2000. Legal framework All Australian businesses whose turnover is above the minimum threshold (currently $75,000 per annum) are required to register for GST. Businesses whose turnover is below the threshold may register if they wish to. A GST-registered business must charge its customers GST on taxable goods and services it provides, but is entitled to a credit for any GST it has paid for its expenditures on these goods and services as well as capital purchases (called input tax credits). A registered business must periodically lodge Business Activity Statements (monthly, quarterly or annually), and at the same time pay the net amount of GST owed to the tax office (if more GST is paid than collected, a refund is paid by the tax office instead). Some goods and services (notably salaries, wages, fresh food, and real estate) are exempt from GST. Other goods and services (rental income and financial services) are \\"input-taxed\\", which means that GST is not charged on the sale, but GST paid by that part of the business is not eligible to be claimed as an input tax credit.Input-taxed sales. Australian Taxation Office. Retrieved 8 February 2015. Division 9 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth). (GST Act) stipulates that GST is applicable to a supply of goods, services and transactions related to real property, obligations or rights. The supply must be for consideration (GST Act s9-15) to a relevant entity registered for GST (Div 23) in the course of enterprise (s9-20). This does not include employment or hobby income. Taxable supplies include goods wholly within Australia, from or to Australia or real property in Australia. Certain types of supplies are free of GST, examples include fresh unprocessed food, medical services, education courses, childcare, exports, pre-owned real estate and going concerns. When an enterprise purchases goods or services to be consumed or used for resupply to an end customer they may receive a refund (input tax credit) on the amount of GST contained in the price (Div 11), which means in effect no GST is paid on those supplies. New residential and commercial properties are subject to GST but re- sale of existing properties is not. All real estate agent fees on either new or second-hand property are subject to GST. Processed foods such as biscuits, soft drinks, restaurant meals and take-away foods are also subject to GST. Registered enterprises for GST must complete a Business Activity Statement (BAS) for reporting to the Australian Taxation Office on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis (depending on revenue and main activity). Impact =Political impact= John Howard had said that \\"GST would never become part of Liberal Party policy\\", but his change of heart would become apparent in the lead-up to the 1998 campaign. It was passed by the Senate in June 1999 in a heavily amended form. The Leader of the Democrats, Meg Lees, viewed the dilution of the GST legislation as a success, but the issue split the Democrats, with Senators Natasha Stott Despoja and Andrew Bartlett voting against GST.Alexandra Kirk (28 June 1999). Democrats make good on GST compromise deal. PM. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved 8 February 2015. The move triggered infighting amongst the Democrats, and while the Democrats performed reasonably well in the 2001 federal election when Stott Despoja was party leader, the infighting worsened, resulting in Stott Despoja being forced out of the leadership and the loss, at the 2004 federal election, of the balance of power they once held in the Senate. The annihilation of the Democrats was completed at the following election in 2007 when they lost all their remaining seats, with the Australian Greens becoming the major third party. Australian Labor Party leader Kim Beazley continued to oppose it during the Howard government's second term. During the 2001 election campaign, Labor made a 'GST rollback' a centrepiece of its election platform. Labor attempted to reprise the effects of the birthday cake interview by deriding the application of GST to cooked and uncooked chickens, but failed to ignite public response to the limited scope of the rollbacks(19 October 2001).

Labor lost the election, and though the September 11 attacks and the so-called Tampa affair dominated the campaign, the loss would effectively end all serious opposition to GST.

New South Wales Treasurer Michael Costa argued in full-page newspaper advertisements and on televised commercials that New South Wales consumers paid A$13 billion in GST but received only A$10 billion back from the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and therefore New South Wales was subsidising resource rich states like Queensland and Western Australia. A Bill was introduced that gave the federal government no obligation to hand back revenue earned by that state to be divided to other non-performing states. Unlike GST,Tarek Dale (30 July 2014).

The federal government counteracted with its own advertising campaign which claimed that New South Wales had breached its contractual obligations under the 1999 GST Agreement by continuing to charge unfair stamp duties and land taxes, which were supposed to have been abolished. After weeks of intense media and public pressure, the New South Wales State Government announced in its budget that it would reduce stamp duty and land tax, but critics argued that the State Government did not go far enough with much broader tax reform in New South Wales required to help encourage investment and business that had been forced elsewhere due to an unfavourable New South Wales business environment. This was in response to the Commonwealth allowing another A$72 million in grants to New South Wales, in addition to existing annual increases. In 2016 Jay Weatherill, Labor Premier of South Australia, supported calls for increasing GST to 15%.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state- politics/jay-weatherill-in-gst-spat-with-bill-shorten/news- story/93c704375a8bc8d65294c95ac641fa1a =Economic and social effects= Critics have argued that the GST is a regressive tax, which has a more pronounced effect on lower income earners, meaning that the tax consumes a higher proportion of their income, compared to those earning large incomes. However, due to the corresponding reductions in personal income taxes, state banking taxes, federal wholesale taxes and some fuel taxes that were implemented when the GST was introduced, former Treasurer Peter Costello claimed that people were effectively paying no extra tax. The preceding months before the GST became active saw a spike in consumption as consumers rushed to purchase goods that they perceived would be substantially more expensive with the GST. Once the tax came into effect, consumer consumption and economic growth declined such that by the first fiscal quarter of 2001, the Australian economy recorded negative economic growth for the first time in more than 10 years. Consumption soon returned to normal however. The Government was criticised by small business owners over the increased administrative responsibilities of submitting Business Activity Statements (BAS) on a quarterly basis to the Australian Taxation Office. A study commissioned by the Curtin University of Technology, Perth in 2000 argued that the introduction of the GST would negatively impact the real estate market as it would add up to 8 percent to the cost of new homes and reduce demand by about 12 percent. The real estate market returned to boom between 2002 and 2004 where property prices and demand increased dramatically, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. During the 2004‚Äì06 period Perth also witnessed a sharp climb in real estate prices and demand. =Tourist refund scheme= Before the introduction of the GST, goods could be purchased from suppliers offering duty-free pricing upon presentation of a current passport and airline tickets. The goods would then remain sealed until the passenger had passed through the customs area at an airport. Following the introduction of the GST, a receipt for goods with a combined total over A$300 is eligible for a refund of any GST paid upon exiting the country with refunds claimed at a TRS (Tourist Refund Scheme) counter at the airport. The advantage of this arrangement is that goods purchased 60 days prior to departure may be freely used within Australia prior departure as long as they are carried in hand luggage and presented when making a refund claim, or shown to customs officials before being checked in as baggage. This does not extend to consumable goods such as food and beverages, or any services such as plane tickets or hotel room charges. To claim the Tourist Refund Scheme you have to follow the given rules: * You have to spend $300 or more including the GST on a single platform. You are allowed to combine all the invoices from the same retailer * The goods that you bought must be available in your baggage or carry-on so they can be checked * The original tax invoice of the good must be available. If there is a tax invoice that exceeds the amount of $1000 must have your address on it * You should have paid for all the items yourself.

He was a vice-chair and top fund-raiser of John Kerry's presidential campaign. Barnes was one of only eight persons who raised over $500,000 for Kerry. Early life and education Barnes was born on April 17, 1938, in Gorman in Eastland County, Texas, to peanut farmer B.F. Barnes and Ina B. Carrigan. He was raised with a younger brother, Rick.Barn Burning Barn Building, Ch. 1 Barnes' family owned a peanut farm in Comanche County, in central Texas. They cultivated about 40 acres, growing peanuts and corn and raising hogs and chickens. The family was poor, having no working electricity until 1946, when government agents brought electricity to Texas farms as a result of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Rural Electrification Administration.Barn Burning Barn Building, Ch. 1 Barnes graduated from De Leon High School in 1956. After high school, Barnes enrolled for one semester at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, followed by a semester at Tarleton College in Stephenville, Texas. During that spring, he married his high school sweetheart, Martha Morgan. He then spent the following summer in Climax, Colorado, working at the molybdenum mine there.Barn Burning Barn Building, Ch. 1 In 1957, at the age of 20, Barnes began studying at the University of Texas at Austin, where he was on the Dean's List for the Business School. Barnes took several jobs to pay his way through college, including a door-to-door job selling Electrolux vacuum cleaners.Barn Burning Barn Building, Ch. 1 Political career Gus F. Mutscher, Governor Preston Smith and former president Lyndon B. Johnson in Brenham, August 17, 1970. While a student at The University of Texas, Barnes worked at the Texas State Health Department. After discovering some financial irregularities that led to the indictment of the state health commissioner, Barnes became interested in politics. At the age of 21, Barnes went back to his home area of the state and ran for state representative, pulling off an upset victory. Advancing quickly through the Texas legislature, by 1963, Barnes was chairman of the powerful Rules Committee. In 1965, the Texas Junior Chamber of Commerce named Barnes as one of \\"Five Outstanding Young Texans\\" and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce recognized Barnes as one of the \\"Ten Outstanding Young Men in America\\" in 1970. Barnes served as state Speaker of the House in Texas from 1965-1969. The position opened when Governor John B. Connally, Jr., named Speaker Byron M. Tunnell to succeed the retiring Ernest O. Thompson on the Texas Railroad Commission. Barnes was chosen by House members to succeed Tunnell and hence became the youngest Speaker in Texas history. As Speaker, Barnes sought to make improvements in education, passing legislation that increased teacher salaries, bumped up the state's fiscal support of public universities, and created the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to oversee and coordinate all the state's institutions of higher learning. Barnes won passage of a minimum wage standard for farm workers, and was also active on environmental issues, winning approval for clean air and water legislation. In 1966, Barnes was the President of the National Legislative Conference and in 1967, was voted President of the Southern Legislative Conference ‚Äì the youngest person and first Texan to receive the honor. He was also U.S. representative to the NATO Conference in 1967, and the United Nations Representative to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1968. Barnes served as Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1969-1973, a post often called the most powerful position in the Texas state government because the lieutenant governor can block a governor's agenda from being considered by the Texas State Senate. =Sharpstown scandal= In 1971, Barnes was caught up along with the Democratic Party in Texas in the political fallout of the Sharpstown scandal, though he stated he had no knowledge of the involvement of several state senators in the scheme. While he was not brought to trial, the scandal contributed to an unsuccessful run for governor and Barnes' exit from public office. Real estate career During the 1970s and 1980s, Barnes developed a multimillion-dollar real estate empire which included the development of such projects as Southwest Parkway and Barton Creek Country Club in Austin. The collapse of oil prices in the mid- to late- 1980s and its effect on the Texas real estate market forced Barnes to file for bankruptcy, following the financial collapse of the Barnes/Connally Partnership, a real estate firm. Lobbying and business career In the late 1990s, Barnes began working with GTECH Corporation, a company that operated lotteries in 37 states including Texas. Barnes is the founder of the Ben Barnes Group (formerly known as Entrecorp), a business consulting and real estate development firm offering expertise in crisis management, legislative processes and strategy, legal issues, and public-private partnerships. Clients range from major Fortune 500 companies to small family-owned businesses, as from a variety of both international and domestic industries. The Ben Barnes Group maintains offices in Washington, D.C., New York City, and Austin, Texas. Barnes has also served as a consultant, director, or chairman of more than two dozen companies, including SBC Communications, American Airlines, Dallas Bank and Trust, Grumman Systems Support Corporation, and Laredo National Bank. Personal life Barnes was married to Martha Morgan in 1957, and they had two children together: Greg and Amy. In 1989, Barnes married Melanie Harper. Barnes and Harper adopted two daughters: Elena Barnes and Blaire Barnes. On September 14, 2019, Ben Barnes and Elizabeth Moore McDermott married at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Nantucket. Awards and volunteering In 1995, The University of Texas named him a Distinguished Alumnus and an endowed fellowship was created in his name at UT's Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. Barnes serves on the board of several non-profit organizations, including the Boys & Girls Club of the Austin Area, the Roosevelt Institute and the Development Board of the University of Texas. Barnes also serves as Vice-Chairman of the LBJ Foundation. Writing Barnes is the author of the book Barn Burning Barn Building: Tales of a Political Life, From LBJ to George W. Bush and Beyond () (with Lisa Dickey), which was first published in 2006. It went on to place on The New York Times Best Seller list.

Biography  Sloterdijk's father was Dutch, his mother German. He studied philosophy, German studies and history at the University of Munich and the University of Hamburg from 1968 to 1974. In 1975 he received his PhD from the University of Hamburg. In the 1980s he worked as a freelance writer, and published his Kritik der zynischen Vernunft in 1983.

In 2001 he was named chancellor of the University of Art and Design Karlsruhe, part of the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe. His best-known Karlsruhe student and former assistant is Marc Jongen, a member of the Bundestag.Cf.

Philosophical stance  Sloterdijk rejects the existence of dualisms‚Äîbody and soul, subject and object, culture and nature, etc.‚Äîsince their interactions, \\"spaces of coexistence\\", and common technological advancement create hybrid realities. Sloterdijk's ideas are sometimes referred to as posthumanism,Michael Kempe, \\"Neulich im Menschenpark: Die phantastische Anthropologie des Peter Sloterdijk\\", in Bernhard Kleeberg et alii (eds.), Die List der Gene: Stratageme eines neuen Menschen (T√ºbingen: Gunter Narr, 2001), pp. 151‚Äî170, specifically pp. 162‚Äî164. and seek to integrate different components that have been, in his opinion, erroneously considered detached from each other. Consequently, he proposes the creation of an \\"ontological constitution\\" that would incorporate all beings‚Äîhumans, animals, plants, and machines.  Philosophical style  In the style of Nietzsche, Sloterdijk remains convinced that contemporary philosophers have to think dangerously and let themselves be \\"kidnapped\\" by contemporary \\"hyper-complexities\\": they must forsake our present humanist and nationalist world for a wider horizon at once ecological and global.Book Description for \\"Neither Sun Nor Death\\", MIT Press 2011 Sloterdijk's philosophical style strikes a balance between the firm academicism of a scholarly professor and a certain sense of anti-academicism (witness his ongoing interest in the ideas of Osho, of whom he became a disciple in the late seventies).Die Tageszeitung interview dd. 13 June 2006, interview in Lettre International Taking a sociological stance, Andreas Dorschel sees Sloterdijk's timely innovation at the beginning of the 21st century in having introduced the principles of celebrity into philosophy.Andreas Dorschel, \\"Denktageb√ºcher: Zur Poetik des philosophischen Journals\\", Philosophische Rundschau LX (2013), no. 4, pp. 264‚Äî298, specifically pp. 293‚Äî297.

(W√ºrzburg: K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, 2006), p. 10.  Works  =Critique of Cynical Reason= The Kritik der zynischen Vernunft, published by Suhrkamp in 1983 (and in English as Critique of Cynical Reason, 1988), became the best-selling work on philosophy in the German language since the Second World War and launched Sloterdijk's career as an author.See Stefan Lorenz Sorgner, \\"In Search of Lost Cheekiness. An Introduction to Peter Sloterdijk's Critique of Cynical Reason\\", in Tabula Rasa, 2003. =Spheres= The trilogy Spheres is the philosopher's magnum opus. The first volume was published in 1998, the second in 1999, and the last in 2004. The trilogy is intended for an educated audience; this becomes clear in its introduction, where Sloterdijk treats Plato's academy which allegedly denied access to anyone who was not a mathematician, or a very precise scientist. However, to make clear that his book was written out of love for humanity and to find common ground, he cites the other rule of Plato's academy: anyone had to stay out who was not willing to enter into love affairs with other students. To underline this he notes that \\"whoever turns away from Eros deprives himself of the vital form.\\" Spheres was conceived because of Sloterdijk's love for philosophy, which he regards highly: \\"If philosophy is regarded as something exclusive it's only because people deny for themselves the best\\". Further, the books were written to express his rich and detailed worldview succinctly, hoping it would enable others to enrich their own: \\"The boundaries of what I'm able to express (or: of what I'm able to transmit) are the boundaries of my world. ... If I were to keep anyone away from my trilogy it would only be those who are not willing to transmit (what they have learned or experienced) in order to subsequently lessen loneliness.\\" Spheres deals with \\"spaces of coexistence\\", spaces commonly overlooked or taken for granted which conceal information crucial to developing an understanding of humanity. The exploration of these spheres begins with the basic difference between mammals and other animals: the biological and utopian comfort of the mother's womb, which humans try to recreate through science, ideology, and religion. From these microspheres (ontological relations such as fetus-placenta) to macrospheres (macro-uteri such as states), Sloterdijk analyzes spheres where humans try but fail to dwell and traces a connection between vital crises (e.g., emptiness and narcissistic detachment) and crises created when a sphere shatters. Sloterdijk has said that the first paragraphs of Spheres are \\"the book that Heidegger should have written\\", a companion volume to Being and Time, namely, \\"Being and Space\\". He was referring to his initial exploration of the idea of Dasein, which is then taken further as Sloterdijk distances himself from Heidegger's positions.In more recent years, a deepening of this take on Heidegger's thought is given expression through a focus on the primordiality of space over time in fundamental ontology as articulated in numerous studies by the British-Lebanese philosopher and architect Nader El-Bizri in his investigation of \\"the place of being\\", of \\"dwelling\\", and primarily of Kh√¥ra. =Nietzsche Apostle= On 25 August 2000 in Weimar, Sloterdijk gave a speech on Nietzsche; the occasion was the centennial of the latter philosopher's death. The speech was later printed as a short book and translated into English. Sloterdijk presented the idea that language is fundamentally narcissistic: individuals, states and religions use language to promote and validate themselves. Historically however, Christianity and norms in Western culture have prevented orators and authors from directly praising themselves, so that for example they would instead venerate God or praise the dead in eulogies, to demonstrate their own skill by proxy. In Sloterdijk's account, Nietzsche broke with this norm by regularly praising himself in his own work. For examples of classical Western \\"proxy-narcissism\\", Sloterdijk cites Otfrid of Weissenburg, Thomas Jefferson and Leo Tolstoy, each of whom prepared edited versions of the four Gospels: the Evangelienbuch, the Jefferson Bible and the Gospel in Brief, respectively. For Sloterdijk, each work can be regarded as \\"a fifth gospel\\" in which the editor validates his own culture by editing tradition to conform to his own historical situation. With this background, Sloterdijk explains that Nietzsche also presented his work Thus Spake Zarathustra as a kind of fifth gospel. In Sloterdijk's account, Nietzsche engages in narcissism to an embarrassing degree, particularly in Ecce Homo, promoting a form of individualism and presenting himself and his philosophy as a brand. However just as the Christian Gospels were appropriated by the above editors, so too was Nietzsche's thought appropriated and misinterpreted by the Nazis. Sloterdijk concludes the work by comparing Nietzsche's individualism with that of Ralph Waldo Emerson, as in Self-Reliance. =Globalization= Sloterdijk also argues that the current concept of globalization lacks historical perspective. In his view it is merely the third wave in a process of overcoming distances (the first wave being the metaphysical globalization of the Greek cosmology and the second the nautical globalization of the 15th century). The difference for Sloterdijk is that, while the second wave created cosmopolitanism, the third is creating a global provincialism. Sloterdijk's sketch of a philosophical history of globalization can be found in Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals (2005; translated as In the World Interior of Capital), subtitled \\"Die letzte Kugel\\" (\\"The final sphere\\"). In an interview with Noema Magazine, Sloterdijk expanded upon the idea of ‚Äúplanetary co- immunism‚Äù, referring to the need to \\"share the means of protection even with the most distant members of the family of man/woman\\" when faced with shared threats such as pandemics. =Rage and Time= In his Zorn und Zeit (translated as Rage and Time), Sloterdijk characterizes the emotion of rage as a psychopolitical force throughout human history. The political aspects are especially pronounced in the Western tradition, beginning with the opening words of Homer's Iliad, \\"Of the rage of Achilles, son of Peleus, sing, O Goddess...\\". Sloterdijk acknowledges the contributions of psychoanalysis for our understanding of strong emotional attitudes: \\"In conformity with its basic erotodynamic approach, psychoanalysis brought much hatred to light, the other side of life.\\" (Rage and Time, p. 14) Importantly, for Sloterdijk, Judeo- Christian conceptions of God ultimately \\"piggyback\\" on the feelings of rage and resentment, creating \\"metaphysical revenge banks\\". For Sloterdijk, \\"God thus becomes the location of a transcendent repository of suspended human rage-savings and frozen plans of revenge.\\"Francesco Klauser in The Berlin Review of Books, December 2010  Genetics dispute  Shortly after Sloterdijk conducted a symposium on philosophy and Heidegger, he stirred up controversy with his essay \\"Regeln f√ºr den Menschenpark\\" (\\"Rules for the Human Park\\").See Frank Mewes, \\"Regulations for the Human Park: On Peter Sloterdijk's Regeln f√ºr den Menschenpark\\" , in Gnosis, Volume VI, No. 1, 2002. In this text, Sloterdijk regards cultures and civilizations as \\"anthropogenic hothouses,\\" installations for the cultivation of human beings; just as we have established wildlife preserves to protect certain animal species, so too ought we to adopt more deliberate policies to ensure the survival of Aristotle's zoon politikon. \\"The taming of man has failed\\", Sloterdijk laments. \\"Civilisation's potential for barbarism is growing; the everyday bestialisation of man is on the increase.\\" Because of the eugenic policies of the Nazis in Germany's recent history, such discussions are seen in Germany as carrying a sinister load. Breaking a German taboo on the discussion of genetic manipulation, Sloterdijk's essay suggests that the advent of new genetic technologies requires more forthright discussion and regulation of \\"bio-cultural\\" reproduction. In the eyes of Habermas, this made Sloterdijk a \\"fascist\\". Sloterdijk replied that this was, itself, resorting to \\"fascist\\" tactics to discredit him. The core of the controversy was not only Sloterdijk's ideas but also his use of the German words Z√ºchtung (\\"breeding\\", \\"cultivation\\") and Selektion (\\"selection\\"). Sloterdijk rejected the accusation of Nazism, which he considered alien to his historical context. Still, the paper started a controversy in which Sloterdijk was strongly criticized, both for his alleged usage of a fascist rhetoric to promote Plato's vision of a government with absolute control over the population, and for committing a non-normative, simplistic reduction of the bioethical issue itself. This second criticism was based on the vagueness of Sloterdijk's position on how exactly society would be affected by developments in genetic science. After the controversy multiplied positions both for and against him, Die Zeit published an open letter from Sloterdijk to Habermas in which he vehemently accused Habermas of \\"criticizing behind his back\\" and espousing a view of humanism that Sloterdijk had declared dead.\\"Anger as philosopher revives vocabulary of Third Reich\\"  Welfare state dispute  Another dispute emerged after Sloterdijk's article \\"Die Revolution der gebenden Hand\\" (13 June 2009; transl. \\"The revolution of the giving hand\\")Peter Sloterdijk \\"Die Revolution der gebenden Hand\\"\\"Die Revolution der gebenden Hand ‚Äì Peter Sloterdijk ‚Äûbelehrt‚Äú Marx eines Richtigeren\\" in the Frankfurter Allgemeine, one of Germany's most widely read newspapers. There Sloterdijk claimed that the national welfare state is a \\"fiscal kleptocracy\\" that had transformed the country into a \\"swamp of resentment\\" and degraded its citizens into \\"mystified subjects of tax law\\". Sloterdijk opened the text with the famous quote of leftist critics of capitalism (made famous in the 19th century by Proudhon in his \\"What Is Property?\\") \\"Property is theft\\", stating, however, that it is nowadays the modern state that is the biggest taker. \\"We are living in a fiscal grabbing semi-socialism ‚Äì and nobody calls for a fiscal civil war.\\"\\"Peter Sloterdijk rebelliert gegen den \\"Zwangssteuerstaat\\" ‚Äì Blasen zu Phrasen\\" He repeated his statements and stirred up the debate in his articles titled \\"Kleptokratie des Staates\\" (transl. \\"Kleptocracy of the state\\") and \\"Aufbruch der Leistungstr√§ger\\" (transl. \\"Uprising of the performers\\") in the German monthly Cicero ‚Äì Magazin f√ºr politische Kultur.:de:Cicero (Zeitschrift)Kleptokratie des Staates, in Cicero, July 2009, p.42 \\"Aufbruch der Leistungstr√§ger, in Cicero, November 2009, p.94 According to Sloterdijk, the institutions of the welfare state lend themselves to a system that privileges the marginalized, but relies, unsustainably, on the class of citizens who are materially successful. Sloterdijk's provocative recommendation was that income taxes should be deeply reduced, the difference being made up by donations from the rich in a system that would reward higher givers with social status. Achievers would be praised for their generosity, rather than being made to feel guilty for their success, or resentful of society's dependence on them.\\"Germany's welfare state under fire ‚Äì One of Germany's foremost public intellectuals, Peter Sloterdijk, began the offensive on the welfare state\\" In January 2010, an English translation was published, titled \\"A Grasping Hand ‚Äì The modern democratic state pillages its productive citizens\\", in Forbes\\"A Grasping Hand ‚Äì The modern democratic state pillages its productive citizens\\" and in the Winter 2010 issue of City Journal.\\"The Grasping Hand-The modern democratic state pillages its productive citizens\\" Sloterdijk's 2010 book, Die nehmende Hand und die gebende Seite, contains the texts that triggered the 2009‚Äì2010 welfare state dispute.  Sex and feminism  In September 2016, Sloterdijk published the e-mail novel The Schelling Project.Peter Sloterdijk, Das Schelling-Projekt (Berlin: Suhrkamp, 2016) The semi-autobiographical text contains a self-portrait of the author, appearing as \\"Peer Sloterdijk\\"; several of Sloterdijk's friends such as Thomas Macho, Siegfried Mauser and Michaela Boenke figure in the novel in slight disguise. Together, so the plot goes, they draft a research proposal to the German Research Funding Agency (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) on the evolution of the female orgasm. To make it look more profound and thus to impress the reviewers, the team fakes a connection of the issue to the metaphysics of the German idealist philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. The reviewers, though, see through the mystification and turn down the application. Following the rejection, the team splits and each of its members takes his or her own course. While Sloterdijk's e-mail novel about an academic hoax was rated mediocre in terms of literary quality,Jens Jessen in DIE ZEIT no. 37, 1 September 2016, p. 39. Sloterdijk fails to develop different voices for his characters, notes Stefan Kister in Stuttgarter Zeitung, 15 September 2016. it came to be seen more as a political statement,Cf. Fr√©d√©ric Valin in Der Freitag no. 39 (26 September 2016): \\"It's obvious: The Schelling Project has not even been intended as a novel; it has been launched as sheer act of provocation.\\" (\\"Es liegt auf der Hand: Das Schelling-Projekt ist nicht als Roman konzipiert, es ist vielmehr als Provokation gedacht.\\") specifically as an attack on gender mainstreaming in 21st century Germany.Sloterdijk sees its foundation in the feminist presentation of women as \\"victims\\" (\\"Opfergetue\\"), analyzes Jens Jessen in DIE ZEIT no. 37, 1 September 2016, p. 39. Critic Elke Schmitter, in a review article for Der Spiegel under the heading 'Woman as an Old Boys' Joke',Elke Schmitter, 'Die Frau als Herrenwitz', Der Spiegel, 1 September 2016. Male fantasies of women \\"dripping wet like a gravel lorry\\" (\\"tropfte [...] schon wie ein Kieslaster\\") when men come even near them are no substitute for literary imagination, Schmitter suggests. described Sloterdijk's text as an anti-feminist pamphlet thinly veiled as a novel.A similar point is made by Stefanie Lohaus in DIE ZEIT, 23 September 2016 In an interview with S√ºddeutsche Zeitung Sloterdijk defended himself against the charges and claimed his attitude towards women to be adoration rather than contempt.Vera Schroeder/David Pfeifer/Sven Michaelsen, 'Peter Sloterdijk im SZ-Gespr√§ch', S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 17 September 2016  Honours and awards  * 1993: Ernst Robert Curtius Prize for Essay Writing * 2000: Friedrich M√§rker Prize for Essay Writing * 2001: Christian Kellerer Prize for the future of philosophical thought * 2005: Business Book Award for the Financial Times Deutschland * 2005: Sigmund Freud Prize for Scientific Prose * 2005: Austrian Decoration for Science and Art * 2006: Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres * 2008: Lessing Prize for Criticism * 2008: Cicero Prize * 2008: International Mendelssohn Prize in Leipzig (category Social Responsibility) * 2009: BDA award for architectural criticism * 2013: Ludwig-B√∂rne-Prize  Film appearances  * Marx Reloaded, Arte, April 2011  List of works  = Works in English translation = * Critique of Cynical Reason, translation by Michael Eldred ; foreword by Andreas Huyssen, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1988. * Thinker on Stage: Nietzsche's Materialism, translation by Jamie Owen Daniel; foreword by Jochen Schulte-Sasse, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1989. * Theory of the Post-War Periods: Observations on Franco-German relations since 1945, translation by Robert Payne; foreword by Klaus-Dieter M√ºller, Springer, 2008. * Terror from the Air, translation by Amy Patton, Los Angeles, Semiotext(e), 2009. * God's Zeal: The Battle of the Three Monotheisms, Polity Pr., 2009. * Derrida, an Egyptian, Polity Pr., 2009. * Rage and Time, translation by Mario Wenning, New York, Columbia University Press, 2010. * Neither Sun nor Death, translation by Steven Corcoran, Semiotext(e), 2011. ‚Äì Sloterdijk answers questions posed by German writer Hans-J√ºrgen Heinrichs, commenting on such issues as technological mutation, development media, communication technologies, and his own intellectual itinerary. * Bubbles: Spheres Volume I: Microspherology, translation by Wieland Hoban, Los Angeles, Semiotext(e), 2011. * The Art of Philosophy: Wisdom as a Practice, translation by Karen Margolis, New York, Columbia University Press, 2012. * You Must Change Your Life, translation by Wieland Hoban, Cambridge, Polity Press, 2013. * In the World Interior of Capital: Towards a Philosophical Theory of Globalization, translation by Wieland Hoban, Cambridge, Polity Press, 2013. * Nietzsche Apostle, (Semiotext(e)/Intervention Series), translation by Steve Corcoran, Los Angeles, Semiotext(e), 2013. * Globes: Spheres Volume II: Macrospherology, translation by Wieland Hoban, Los Angeles, Semiotext(e), 2014. * Foams: Spheres Volume III: Plural Spherology, translation by Wieland Hoban, Los Angeles, Semiotext(e), 2016. * Not Saved: Essays after Heidegger, translation by Ian Alexander Moore and Christopher Turner, Cambridge, Polity Press, 2016. *\\"The Domestication of Human Beings and the Expansion of Solidarities\\", in J.

His ideas have had a massive influence on the development of the modern supermarket. Saunders worked for most of his life trying to develop a truly automated store, developing Piggly Wiggly, Keedoozle, and Foodelectric store concepts. Early life Saunders was born on a farm in Amherst County, Virginia, to Abram Warwick and Mary Gregory. Saunders mother died when he was five. Abram had served in the Confederate army under Stonewall Jackson but had struggled financially in the aftermath of the war. In 1891, his father moved the family to Montgomery County, Tennessee, where his father worked as a laborer and sharecropper on a plantation near Palmyra, Tennessee. Saunders worked the plantation as well throughout his early childhood. By age 11, he was also working in a sawmill and limestone kiln during the summer and at a general store during the holidays. He received only two years of formal education in Palmyra, before quitting school entirely at 14 to work full-time for the general store. Saunders worked a variety occupations over the next five years throughout the region, including shop assistant, night watchman and sawmill laborer. Recognizing the need for further education to advance, Saunders became a prolific reader and autodidact. At age 19, Saunders had moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, where he started working in the wholesale grocery business for John Hurst and Joseph Boillin, rapidly rising in the business. In Clarksville Saunders met Carolyn Amy Walker, the daughter of a prominent Illinois attorney. Despite their contrasting backgrounds, they were married on 6 October 1903. The following year they moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where Saunders took up positions working for the wholesale grocers Shanks, Phillips & Co, as well as William Cole Early. Memphis in this period was booming - the population had soared from 33,000 in 1880 to more than 100,000 by the time the Saunders' arrived. A major river point and railroad junction between the north and south, Memphis was a key distributor of goods to towns and cities throughout the region, whilst cotton merchants often served the dual role of selling wholesale supplies to farms and plantations as well, such that wholesaling was one of the largest industries in Memphis and one of its most lucrative. In February 1913, he created United Stores, Inc., with 21 retail customers, giving Shanks, Phillips control of wholesale purchasing and advertising. A jointly owned United Store was opened in June 1914. Saunders' three children, Lee, Clarence Jr., and Amy Carolyn, were born in 1903, 1909 and 1912 respectively.  Piggly Wiggly  The original Piggly Wiggly Store, Memphis, Tennessee On 11 Sept. 1916, Saunders launched the self- service revolution in the United States by opening the first self-service Piggly Wiggly store, at 79 Jefferson Street in Memphis, Tennessee. Saunders had renovated his United Store, removing old countertops, and replacing them with characteristic turnstiles at the entrance and exit, and cabinets arranged along a continuous path, which ended at a cashier stand complete with adding machine and cash register. The 1,125 sq ft store included a front lobby, the continuous-path middle salesroom, and rear stockroom. The store incorporated shopping baskets, self-service branded products, and checkouts at the front. Removing unnecessary clerks, creating elaborate aisle displays, and rearranging the store to force customers to view all of the merchandise in a continuous path, were just some of the characteristics of the early Piggly Wiggly stores. The store stocked four times the variety of items normally found in an ordinary grocery store, but did not offer fresh meat in the original store. A refrigerator separated two of the aisles, offering butter and cheese. Bins offered fruits and vegetables, while flour and other bulk good were pre-packaged and placed near the end of the shopper's journey through the aisles. The concept of the \\"Self-Serving Store\\" patent was filed by Saunders on 21 Oct. 1916, and granted on 9 Oct. 1917 as Patent #1,242,872. Three new patent applications followed, including Patent #1,357,521 for the basic store design. Patent #1,297,405 was filed on 5 Feb. 1918 and granted on 18 March 1919, which covered his means of tagging prices next to the grocery item. He was also granted a patent for his idea of giving shoppers a printed receipt from the adding machine tape. Saunders then listed Piggly Wiggly shares on the New York Stock Exchange in Feb. 1922. In April 1922, the company sold 50,000 new shares on the market at $43 a share. In 1921, there were 615 stores in 200 cities and 40 states. By 1923, Piggly Wiggly had grown into 1,267 stores, 667 owned by the company and the rest owned by franchisees. The company employed 250 people in Memphis. Stock in Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc., paid a dividend of 11%. The success of Piggly Wiggly encouraged a raft of imitators, including Handy Andy stores, Helpy Selfy stores, Mick-or-Mack stores and Jitney Jungle, all of which operated under patented systems.Economics of Retailing; Paul Henry Nystrom, 1930, Saunders's US patent for the store design  Wall Street raid  In the early 1920s Saunders began construction of a pink marble mansion in Memphis. Then, in early 1923, a group of franchised outlets in New York failed. Merrill Lynch and other speculators on Wall Street attempted a bear raid on the price of Piggly Wiggly stock, gambling the price would fall. With a loan of $10 million from a number of Southern bankers, plus a bit of his own money, Saunders counteracted with a corner, buying a large amount of Piggly Wiggly stock in hopes of driving up the price. He flamboyantly declared his intent in newspaper ads. Saunders bought Piggly Wiggly stock until he had orders for 196,000 of the 200,000 outstanding shares. The firm's share price went from a low of $39 in late 1922 to $124 by March 20, 1923. Pressured by the 'bears', the New York Stock Exchange declared a 'corner' existed (see cornering the market), and gave the 'bears' five days rather than 24 hours to deliver the stock Saunders had bought. The additional time meant \\"a flood of stock poured [in] from distant points and gave the shorts opportunity to deliver.\\"The Wall Street Journal, Jun 23, 1923 In the words of John Brooks, \\"...in mid-August, with the September 1st deadline for repayment of two and a half million dollars on his loan staring him in the face and with nothing like that amount of cash either on hand or in prospect, he resigned as president of Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc., and turned over his assets-his stock in the company, his Pink Palace, and all the rest of his property-to his creditors.\\" The Pink Palace mansion eventually became Memphis' first museum in 1930.  Sole Owner stores  In 1928, Saunders went on to create the Clarence Saunders, Sole Owner of My Name Stores, Inc. grocery chain. The chain, which was known by the public as Sole Owner stores, initially flourished. However the chain went into bankruptcy in 1930 during the Great Depression.  The Tigers football team  In the late 1920s, to promote his newest grocery venture, Saunders founded a professional football team. The full name of the team was the Clarence Saunders Sole Owner of My Name Tigers, but it was usually just called The Tigers. The Tigers played professional teams from around the country, including the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers. In 1929, the Tigers beat the Green Bay Packers 20‚Äì6. In 1930 the National Football League invited The Tigers to join their organization, but Saunders refused their offer. It is said that Saunders disbanded his football team because he did not like to travel to other cities for away games.Lauderdale, Vance \\"Ask Vance: Coach Houses\\", Memphis Magazine, March 1, 2008  Keedoozle  On 22 Nov. 1935, Saunders chartered the prototype of an automated store. He named it Keedoozle, which some assumed stood for \\"key does it all\\", but Saunders stated was just made up, as was Piggly Wiggly. The Keedoozle was an automated store, similar to very large vending machine, or Automat. Merchandise was displayed as single units, each within a glass cabinet with a keyhole beneath. Customers entering the store were given a key that they placed in the keyhole below the goods they wished to buy. The quantity desired was determined by the number of times the key was inserted in the slot. This action, recorded the item on punched tape in the key, and automatically moved the item via conveyor belt to the front of the store. Upon reaching the exit gate at the front of the store, an attendant deciphered the customer's tape and produced the bill. After payment, the customer's groceries were delivered, bagged and wrapped. Pilot stores operated in Memphis and Chicago, but the complex and expensive system could not compete with shopping carts. Saunders developed two versions of the Keedoozle. The first was in 1937, which was abandoned when the US entered World War II. Saunders returned to the idea in 1948, opening an improved version. Saunders sold twelve franchises of the revised concept. In 1949 he predicted \\"In five years there will be a thousand Keedoozles throughout the US, selling $5 billion worth of goods.\\"Life magazine, Jan 3, 1949, p36  Foodelectric  Until the time of his death, Saunders was developing plans for another automatic store system called the \\"Foodelectric\\". The Foodelectric concept is a clear predecessor to self checkout. Saunders described it as follows: > The store operates so automatically that the customer can collect her > groceries herself, wrap them and act as her own cashier. It eliminates the > checkout crush, cuts overhead expenses and enables a small staff to handle a > tremendous volume... I can handle a $2 million volume with only eight > employees.Inventors & Inventions, ed. Doris Simonis, p. 1298, The central invention was a primitive computer, or \\"shopping brain\\" which was loaned to the shopper, who then roamed among the store's glass-enclosed items. The store, which was to be located two blocks from the first Piggly Wiggly store in downtown Memphis, never opened.  Personal life  Clarence and Carolyn divorced on 27 Sept. 1928, and Clarence married Patricia Houston Bamberg on 20 Dec. 1928. During WW II, Saunders made toy wagons, baby strollers and broomsticks. He died in 1953, and was interred at Memphis Memorial Park Cemetery.Find A Grave Memorial# 10297875  Miscellaneous  Saunders was one of the first to use newspaper advertising to campaign for a political candidate, at least in Tennessee. He campaigned for Austin Peay, an acquaintance from his hometown, Clarksville, Tennessee. Peay won in 1922 and gave credit to Saunders' advertising. When Governor Peay ran for a third term in 1926 (Tennessee governors held office for two year terms then) Saunders inexplicably opposed him, using newspaper ads to denounce his former friend. In 1928 Saunders backed Henry Horton for Governor against Hill McAlister. Memphis political leader E. H. Crump backed McAlister. The candidates were completely overshadowed by the newspaper advertising war waged by Saunders and Crump. Their feud was personal and striking, since few in Memphis had dared challenge Crump, one of the legendary city bosses in American politics. After 1928 Saunders' fortunes declined, and he did not write political ads again. Patent * ' - Self-serving store‚ÄîC.

Content is based on the monthly print publication, which publishes 9 issues per year, distributing over 103,000 copies to over 2,600 locations across Canada. The magazine has an average of 361,200 monthly readers. Their website, exclaim.ca, has an average of 675,000 unique visitors a month. History Exclaim! began as a discussion among campus and community radio programmers at Ryerson's CKLN-FM in 1991. It was started by then-CKLN programmers Ian Danzig and Ron Anicich, together with other programmers and Toronto musicians. The goal of the publication was to support great Canadian music that was otherwise going unheralded. The group worked through 1991 to produce their first issue in April 1992, with monthly issues being produced since. Ian Danzig has been the publisher of the magazine since its start. Anicich was the magazine's founding editor, and was succeeded in 1995 by James Keast. The magazine had no official name for its first year of operations, with only the !*@# logo appearing on the cover, and introduced the name Exclaim! after Danzig realized that its growth and appeal to advertisers were being limited by a reader tendency to refer to it as Fuck. Similarly to an alternative weekly newspaper, the magazine is distributed as a free publication at campus and community radio stations, bars, record stores, libraries, and coffee shops, although home mail delivery is also available. With Chart's decision to cease publication of its newsstand edition in January 2009, Exclaim! is now Canada's only nationally distributed general interest music magazine still operating as a print publication. Danzig has attributed the magazine's survival in part to the fact that the internet ushered in an era of \\"free culture\\" in the late 1990s, meaning that the magazine never had to change its existing business model or alienate readers by introducing paywalls. Website The magazine's website features reviews, interviews and profiles, some of which are not found in the print publication. It includes a news page that is updated with the latest in music and music-related culture. The site reaches over 675,000 unique users every month. It also features Exclaim! TV, which includes regular instalments of video interviews with musicians (since late 2016, focusing primarily on metal and punk artists), as well as a streams section featuring new albums, EPs, singles, music videos and full performances. In recent years, exclaim.ca has increased its film coverage, covering festivals, such as the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), the Sundance Film Festival, Hot Docs Documentary Film Festival, and the Toronto After Dark Film Festival, and publishing interviews with a number of high-profile directors and movie stars. Its comedy section, similarly, focuses on profiles and interviews with established and up-and-coming stand-up comedians. As well as music, exclaim.ca reviews films, concerts, comedy specials, and live comedy.

It is designed and produced exclusively by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology, and built at the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant.Land-Based Ballistic Missiles Characteristics The Topol-M is a cold-launched, three-stage, solid- propellant, silo-based or road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile. The missile's length is 22.7 m and the first stage has a body diameter of 1.9 m. The mass at launch is 47,200 kg, including the 1,200 kg payload. Topol-M carries a single warhead with an 800 kt yield but the design is compatible with MIRV warheads. According to chief designer Yury Solomonov, the missile can carry four to six warheads along with decoys. Its minimum range is estimated to be 2,000 km and the maximum range 10,500 km. It has three solid rocket stages with inertial, autonomous flight control utilizing an onboard GLONASS receiver. It is reputed to have the highest accuracy of any Russian ICBM with a CEP of 200m. The body of the rocket is made by winding carbon fiber. The Topol-M may be deployed either inside a reinforced missile silo or from an APU launcher mounted on the MZKT-79221 \\"Universal\\" 16-wheeled transporter-erector-launcher. This mobile launcher is capable of moving through roadless terrain, and launching a missile from any point along its route. The designation for the silo-based Topol-M missile is believed to be RS-12M2, while the mobile version is RS-12M1. Dmitry Medvedev during his visit to a regiment of the Strategic Rocket Forces equipped with Topol-M Combat Support Vehicle (MOBD) 15V231 of Topol/Topol-M at the Saint-Petersburg Artillery Museum Troposphere Relay Station R-406VCh of Topol/Topol-M at the Saint-Petersburg Artillery Museum The first stage has rocket motors developed by the Soyuz Federal Center for Dual-Use Technologies. These give the missile a much higher acceleration than other ICBM types. They enable the missile to accelerate to the speed of 7,320 m/s and to travel a flatter trajectory to distances of up to 10,000 km. As a solid propellant design, the missile can be maintained on alert for prolonged periods of time and can launch within minutes of being given the order. Development and deployment The development of the missile began in the late 1980s as a response to the American Strategic Defense Initiative. Initially an evolutionary upgrade of the RT-2PM Topol, the missile was redesigned in 1992. The missile's principal designer was Yuri Solomonov, who would later oversee the development of the RSM-56 Bulava. The first flight test took place on December 20, 1994, during which the missile, launched from Plesetsk, hit its target away. Two missiles were put on experimental combat duty in December 1997 at Tatishchevo. The fifth test flight on 22 October 1998 was unsuccessful as the missile exploded after being launched; the sixth test flight two months later was successful. The 104th Regiment of the Taman Missile Division, based in Saratov, introduced 10 missiles into service on 30 December 1998; another ten entered service with a second regiment in December 1999. Silo launcher Topol-M entered service by presidential decree on 13 July 2000, the third, fourth and fifth regiments entered service in 2000, 2003 and 2005. The last regiment was to arrive in 2012. On December 12, 2006 the first three mobile Topol-M missile systems entered duty with a missile unit stationed near the town of Teykovo.Strategic Missile Forces spokesman Col. Alexander Vovk, quoted by ITAR TASS. By the end of 2010 the Russian Strategic Missile Troops operated 70 Topol-M missile systems including 52 silo-based and 18 mobile systems. A further 8 missiles were to join the Forces by 2011‚Äì2012. Current Strategic Rocket Forces Order of Battle lists the following sites with Topol-M missiles: * 27th Guards Rocket Army (HQ: Vladimir)  60th Missile Division at Tatishchevo with 60 silo-based Topol-M  54th Guards Missile Division at Teykovo with 18 mobile Topol-M The Topol-M missiles have a lifetime between 15 and 20 years. Missile defense evasion capabilities According to Russia the missile and its various versions, RS-24 Yars (SS-27 Mod 2), RS-26 Rubezh (another SS-27 version) and RSM-56 Bulava (SLBM version of SS-27) are designed to counter and evade current or planned United States missile defense system. It is said to be capable of making evasive maneuvers to avoid a kill by interceptors, and carries targeting countermeasures and decoys. One of the Topol-M's most notable features is its short engine burn time following take-off, intended to minimize satellite detection of launches and thereby complicate both early warning and interception by missile defense systems during boost phase. The missile also has a relatively flat ballistic trajectory, complicating defense acquisition and interception. According to The Washington Times, Russia has conducted a successful test of the evasive payload delivery system. The missile was launched on 1 November 2005 from the Kapustin Yar facility. The warhead changed course after separating from the launcher, making it difficult to predict a re-entry trajectory. Equipment of Topol-M with MIRV A new missile loosely based on Topol-M and equipped with multiple re-entry vehicles (MIRV) is called RS-24 Yars. In January 2009 Russian sources hinted that the production of the mobile Topol-M missile would be shutting down in 2009 and that the new MIRVed RS-24 version would replace it. Operators ;: The Strategic Missile Troops are the only operator of the RT-2PM2 Topol-M. As of March 2020, 60 silo-based and 18 mobile RT-2PM2 Topol-M missiles are deployed with 2 rocket divisions: Silo-based: * 60th Rocket Division at Tatishchevo Air Base Road-mobile: * 54th Guards Rocket Division at Teykovo It is believed that since 2010 no more RT-2PM2 Topol-M missiles have been purchased in favor of the newest RS-24 Yars.

He is musical director of the Institute of New Music and Media at the University of Music Karlsruhe and has been composer in residence at the Lucerne Festival and the Salzburg Festival. He was honoured as Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2001. His musical work includes more than 500 works. In 2012, The Guardian wrote: \\"enormous output and bewildering variety of styles and sounds\\". Career Rihm was born on 13 March 1952, in Karlsruhe. He finished both his school and his studies in music theory and composition at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Karlsruhe with in 1972, two years before the premiere of his early work Morphonie at the 1974 Donaueschingen Festival launched his career as a prominent figure in the European new music scene. Rihm's early work, combining contemporary techniques with the emotional volatility of Mahler and of Schoenberg's early expressionist period, was regarded by many as a revolt against the avant-garde generation of Boulez, Stockhausen (with whom he studied in 1972‚Äì73), and others, and led to a large number of commissions in the following years. From 1973 to 1976 he studied composition with Klaus Huber in Freiburg im Breisgau. Other teachers were Wolfgang Fortner and Humphrey Searle. In the late 1970s and early 1980s his name was associated with the movement called New Simplicity. In 1978 he became an instructor at the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse. Since 1985 Rihm has been professor for composition at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Karlsruhe. His work still continues to plough expressionist furrows, though the influence of Luigi Nono, Helmut Lachenmann and Morton Feldman, amongst others, has affected his style significantly. Rihm is an extremely prolific composer, with hundreds of completed scores, a large portion of which are yet to be commercially recorded. (See the List of the compositions of Wolfgang Rihm, in German, or the IRCAM works list, in French). He does not always regard a finished work the last word on a subject‚Äîfor example the orchestral work Ins Offene... (1990) was completely rewritten in 1992, and then used as the basis for his piano concerto Sphere (1994), before the piano part of Sphere was recast for the solo piano work Nachstudie (also 1994). (In 2002 Rihm also produced a new version of Nachstudie, Sph√§re nach Studie, for harp, two double basses, piano and percussion, and also a new version of Sphere, called Sph√§re um Sph√§re, for two pianos and chamber ensemble.) Other important works include thirteen string quartets, the operas Die Hamletmaschine (1983‚Äì1986, text by Heiner M√ºller) and Die Eroberung von Mexico (1987‚Äì1991, based on texts by Antonin Artaud), over twenty song-cycles, the oratorio Deus Passus (1999‚Äì2000) commissioned by the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart, the chamber orchestra piece Jagden und Formen (1995‚Äì2001), more than thirty concertos and a series of related orchestral works bearing the title Vers une symphonie fleuve. The New York Philharmonic premi√®red Rihm's 2004 commission Two Other Movements. In 2008 Rihm composed KOLONOS  2 Fragments by H√∂lderlin after Sophokles for orchestra and countertenor, premiered in Bad Wildbad with the countertenor Matthias Rexroth. Invited by Walter Fink, he was the fifth composer featured in the annual Komponistenportr√§t of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 1995, in two programs of chamber music and Lied, also of Robert Schumann, including his works Fremde Szene I for piano trio, Vier Lieder after poems of Paul Celan, Klavierst√ºck 7, Klavierst√ºck 6, Das Rot, six songs after poems of Karoline von G√ºnderrode, Antlitz for violin and piano, and Fremde Szene III. In 1995 he contributed Communio (Lux aeterna) to the Requiem of Reconciliation. He received an honorary doctorate of the Free University of Berlin in 1998. In 2003 he received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize. In March 2010 the BBC Symphony Orchestra featured the music of Rihm in one of their 'total immersion' weekends at the Barbican Centre, London. Recordings from this weekend were used for three 'Hear and Now' programmes on BBC Radio 3 dedicated to his work.Hear and Now: Wolfgang Rihm: Episode 1 BBC, March 2010 On 27 July 2010, Rihm's opera Dionysos, based on Nietzsche‚Äôs late cycle of poems Dionysian-Dithyrambs, had its world premiere at the Salzburg Festival, conducted by Ingo Metzmacher, and designed by Jonathan Meese. This performance was voted World Premiere of the Year (Urauff√ºhrung des Jahres) for 2010/11 by Opernwelt magazine. He revised his Gegenst√ºck (2006) for bass saxophone, percussion and piano, premiered by Trio Accanto on 16 August 2010 to celebrate the 80th birthday of Walter Fink. Anne-Sophie Mutter premiered his violin concerto Lichtes Spiel (Light Games) in Avery Fisher Hall with the New York Philharmonic on 18 November 2010.

The town borders Bukit Batok to the north, Bukit Timah to the northeast, Queenstown to the east and Jurong East to the west. Etymology \\"Clementi\\" derives its name from 'Clementi Road', the main traffic route that still runs into the district to this day. It was once known as 'Reformatory Road' as there was a boys' home situated along the road. In 1947, the Singapore Rural Board discussed renaming the road. Their original intention was to name it after Sir Hugh Clifford, but it was eventually named as Clementi Road. It is generally suggested that the road was named after Sir Cecil Clementi Smith, who was the first British High Commissioner in the Straits Settlements. However, it is also possible that the road was named after Sir Cecil Clementi, another former Governor of the Straits Settlements (1930‚Äì33) who initiated the construction of the Kallang Airport. History The present area occupying Clementi Avenue 1 used to be known as 'Sussex Estate', named after the historic county of Sussex in England. The road running inside Sussex Estate was called Goodwood Road. It was developed in the mid-1950s to house the families of British senior non- commissioned officers. When Clementi underwent a major transformation beginning in 1975, Sussex Estate was the only pre-development feature that was retained. It was demolished in 1997. Most of the area currently occupied by Clementi New Town today was once a military installation called 'Colombo Camp'. It is not known when the camp came into existence, however what is known is that the Singapore Guard Regiment, formed in 1948, stationed its troops there. When the regiment disbanded in November 1971, the camp was left to stand for another four more years before it was demolished in 1975. Clementi New Town was subsequently developed between 1975 and 1979 on the plot of land that was once occupied by the camp. Planned as a self-sufficient residential town with a range of facilities and services, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) began clearing the area in 1974 and affected villagers were resettled. An iconic landmark at Clementi is the steel truss railway bridge crossing Sungei Ulu Pandan. It was once part of the Jurong KTMB Railway Line which was constructed to facilitate the transportation of manufactured products from Jurong to Malaysia, and raw materials from Malaysia to the industrial estate at Jurong. Construction of the railway began in 1963, and the first train ran in 1966. The Jurong section of the railway remained in use for the next four decades until its closure in the early 1990s. Today, the disused track continues to attract much interest from the public, especially people with a taste for history, nature and photography. Geography Clementi's arterial road, Clementi Road, runs for some 5 kilometres, from the vicinity around Bukit Timah, at Jalan Anak Bukit, to the West Coast Highway, but the geographical entity of Clementi is generally regarded as the area dominated by HDB flats around Commonwealth Avenue West and the Clementi MRT station. Besides Clementi Road, the two other arterial roads that serve the new town are the Ayer Rajah Expressway and the West Coast Highway. The primary residential district in Clementi is Clementi New Town and forms a large bulk of its residents and identity. The area also consists of many landed properties, especially in the West of the area. The boundaries of Clementi New Town are Sunset Way Estate to the North, Clementi Road to the East, West Coast Highway to the South, and Clementi Avenue 6 to the West. =Neighbourhoods= There are 4 constituencies in the town, and 7 neighbourhoods (N1 to N7) within the Clementi vicinity.citypost.sg - HDB Statistics for Clementi Estate Most of the neighbourhoods are centralised or aligned along their respective neighbourhood centres, where most of the commercial activities are conducted, other than Clementi Town Centre. Politics Clementi was last an independent political constituency in the 1984 general election. Clementi now comes under the West Coast GRC (West Coast ward), Jurong GRC (Clementi ward) and Holland- Bukit Timah GRC (Ulu Pandan & Bukit Timah wards). West Coast GRC is led by Minister for Trade and Industry, Lim Hng Kiang. The constituency first faced a challenge from the Workers' Party in the 1997 general election. Since then, the constituency has received walkovers in both the 2001 and 2006 general elections. In the 2011 general election, the PAP slate for five-member West Coast GRC, comprising Lim Hng Kiang, S. Iswaran, Arthur Fong, Lawrence Wong Shyun Tsai and Foo Mee Har, faced a contest against the Reform Party led by Kenneth Jeyaretnam. Clementi was drawn into Jurong GRC after the electoral boundaries changed as a result of the 2015 general elections. The PAP-Jurong GRC team won 79.28% of the votes in that election. Dr Tan Wu Meng currently represents the Clementi division after winning a seat in the 2015 General Elections. Currently, West Coast Town Council office is still being occupied in this very location at the Clementi Mall, but it is now meant for residents in Dover, Pandan Gardens, Teban Gardens and West Coast. Amenities The Commonwealth Cinema on the south side of Clementi MRT station was demolished in 2008 and rebuilt into a 4-storey shopping mall, now named, 'CityVibe'. The former Eng Wah's Empress Entertainment Centre Cineplex has also been rebuilt and reopened as '321 Clementi' in March 2015. Further from the town centre, a shopping complex, West Coast Plaza, not only serves the upmarket residents of the condominiums along West Coast Road. The Singapore Police 'D' Divisional Headquarters is located at Clementi Avenue 5, while the Clementi Neighbourhood Police Post is situated at Clementi Avenue 3. Clementi Fire Station is located off Commonwealth Avenue West. In April 2005, the HDB announced plans to build a new mixed-use development at Clementi Town Centre, on the existing bus interchange site. The new development complex was to house a 5-storey retail podium with two basements, two 40-storey residential blocks (Clementi Towers), the West Coast Town Council (Clementi Office), a public library and an air- conditioned bus interchange. On 21 May 2011, The Clementi Mall ‚Äì the new retail shopping mall which is part of the mixed-use development, officially opened. The mall is linked directly to Clementi MRT station on the 3rd level, and the new air-conditioned Clementi Bus Interchange at the 1st level has direct access to the mall. It is the first development in Singapore to integrate public housing, public transport and commercial facilities built together within a single complex. On 15 May 2012, the mixed development won the prestigious international FIABCI Prix d'Excellence award, scoring the Runner-up award under the Master Plan Category. Clementi United Temple, Singapore Buddhist Youth Mission, Ang Chee Sia Ong Temple and Tentera Di-Raja Mosque are some places of worship located in Clementi. Recreation Clementi has a swimming complex and a sports hall for badminton or table tennis located near the MRT station. The Clementi Stadium, with a capacity of 4,000 and West Coast Recreation Centre are located near West Coast Road and can be seen from the Ayer Rajah Expressway. West Coast Park and Clementi Woods Park are situated further away from the central area but are still accessible by bus. Education The Japanese School Primary School Clementi Campus Clementi is serviced by several educational facilities, some of which have a long history. Primary schools in the area include Clementi Primary School, Nan Hua Primary School, Pei Tong Primary School and Qifa Primary School. Secondary schools include Clementi Town Secondary School, Nan Hua High School, New Town Secondary School, Tanglin Secondary School and Kent Ridge Secondary School. The NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, an independent school specialising in Mathematics and Science, is located at Clementi Avenue 1. The School of Science and Technology, Singapore, which specialises in Science, Technology and Applied Learning, is located at the junction of Clementi Road and Commonwealth Avenue West near Dover MRT station and Clementi MRT station as well. Tertiary educational institutions bordering or situated along Clementi Road include Ngee Ann Polytechnic, SIM Headquarters, Singapore University of Social Sciences and the National University of Singapore (NUS). There is a direct bus service from the Clementi bus interchange that loops around the NUS campus. Singapore Polytechnic is located along Commonwealth Avenue West next to Dover MRT Station.

Most active in the north-western section of Bangladesh around the Rajshahi region, Bangla Bhai gained a nationwide and worldwide notoriety for bombings and other terrorist activities. Biography Bangla Bhai gave an interview to national and local journalist. This interview would be a significant source of information about his life. His father was Nazir Hossain Pramanik of Kannipara village in Gabtoli upazila in Bogra. He claimed to have graduated from Rajshahi University in 1995 with a master's in Bangla. The Daily Star reporter contacted the university to verify his claims. The university claimed there was no student with the Azizur Rahman at the Bangla Department in 1995. When the Daily Star reported pointed out this contradiction Bangla Bhai replied: \\"I studied Bangla at Azizul Haq University College affiliated with Rajshahi University. Bangla Bhai remained private and guarded about his education and background. His senior officer in the organization Amir Maulana Abdur Rahman who was also present during the interview reported that Bangla Bhai studied at Tarafsartaj Senior Fazil Madrasa. Bangla Bhai said regarding his alias \\"I was a Bangla teacher at two top coaching centres in Dhaka. As my students did well in Bangla, the authorities of coaching centres called me Bangla Bhai,\\"he did not name the coaching centres or their exact locations. Bangla Bhai also denied certain reports that he was aligned with Bangladesh Chhatra League. \\"I supported it when I was in school. As a college student, I joined Islami Chhatra Shibir (an Islamist student organisation allied with Jamaat-e-Islami). When I finished my study in 1995, I quit Shibir because Jamaat accepted female leadership although it said it considered female leadership sacrilege.\\" He joined JMJB(Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh) and rose to the rank of administrator of military affairs and an acting member of the Majlis-e-Sura, its main decision making board of trustees. Bangla Bhai got to be notorious for the torment and intimidation of the rivals of JMJB and minorities. On 17 August 2005, JMJB, under Islam's administration, dispatched an across the nation assault by blasting 500 bombs. Alongside Shaykh Abdur Rahman, Islam is affirmed to have engineered the bombings. In late 2005, a progression of suicide bomb assaults shook Bangladesh. JMJB and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh have asserted obligation of these assaults. Militant activity *He started operations in the northern Rajshahi locale in 2004 by crusading against neighborhood crooks, purportedly with the assistance of the police and some administration authorities. *Taskforce against Torture is a Bangladeshi human rights organization which was founded in 2002. It has recorded more than 500 instances of individuals being threatened and tortured by Bangla Bhai and his associates. *Abdur Rahman and Bangla Bhai set up organisational bases and militant training camps in madrasas and in remote areas of the country, mostly in the dense forests and hilly areas. They translated their plan into action with the help of huge funds from foreign countries that were meant for building mosques and madrasas. *August 2005, estimated 500 bombs were detonated in almost every district of Bangladesh except one within one hour. The explosions caused the death of three individuals and injured about 100 individuals. *In mid-November 2005, two Judges were killed when a bomb was tossed at their vehicle in the town of Jhalalkati, 120 km (75 miles) south of the capital, Dhaka. *29 November 2005-Seven individuals, including the suspected suicide bomber, died in the attack on Gazipur. This was the first Suicide bomb attack in Bangladesh's History. In Chittagong, two police officers were slain the suspected bomber was injured and immobilized. At slightest 16 individuals, 13 of them police officers were injured in Chittagong notwithstanding those murdered. Arrest The Government of Bangladesh broadcast a 5 million taka reward for the catch of Bangla Bhai or data on him, which would lead to his capture. The RAB(Rapid Action Battalion) intelligence unit and RAB-9 raced to Mymensingh in the early hours of 6 March 2006 and caught Bangla Bhai's wife Fahima and minor child Saad from a house on Ram Krishna Mission Road in Mymensingh town at around 5:00am. Acting on information obtained from his wife, the RAB men commanded by its intelligence wings head Lt Colonel Gulzar Uddin Ahmed encompassed the place of a town Doctor Umed Ali at Rampur in Muktagachha, 30 kilometers off Mymensingh, at around 7:00am and began looking for Bangla Bhai. As RAB Sergeant Rafiq, who was posted in a contiguous tin-roofed house, attempted to peep into the space to see who were inside, Bangla Bhai shot him once in the head. The RAB men were able to remove the sergeant to safety. Two or three minutes after Bangla Bhai assaulted Sergeant Rafiq, an effective bomb went off inside the tin- roofed room where Bangla Bhai was remaining. The blast wrecked the rooftop and an edge of the room caught fire. RAB asked him to surrender, and informed him he was surrounded. Bangla Bhai exited the house at around 7:30am and surrendered. He showed signs of injury from the blast. Bangla Bhai's bodyguard Masud was discovered lying on the floor, he was badly injured from the blast. The entire house was smoldered and just the columns were remained. Injured RAB Sergeant Rafiq was flown Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Dhaka. RAB sources informed the journalists present that three cases would be filed against the terrorist- one under Arms Act, another under Explosives Substance Act and the third for striking the officers. As the information of Bangla Bhai's catch spread, many individuals from close by towns raced to Rampur. The merry group remained on the housetops of houses, trees and both sides of the street as the injured Bangla Bhai was being taken to the Hospital. In Mymensingh town, several individuals exited their homes, workplaces and shops to have a look of Bangla Bhai and continued applauding as the RAB men were taking him to the Mymensingh medical college and hospital in a security convoy. Death JMB leaders Shaikh Abdur Rahman and Siddiqur Rahman alias Bangla Bhai had been given death sentences for the killings of two assistant judges in Jhalakathi. Along with 5 other militants, Siddique ul-Islam was executed by hanging on 30 March 2007. Family A Dhaka court on 10 August 2010 sentenced his wife (Fahima pseudonym Farzana) and two JMB men (Salahuddin alias Saleheen and Asaduzzaman Chowdhury alias Panir) to 20 years' imprisonment each for having explosives. Judge Mohammad Rezaul Islam of the Speedy Trial Tribunal-4 passed on the sentence in vicinity of the convicts.

It is used as a slogan and written catchphrase in graffiti, tattoos and other imagery. It is sometimes numerically rendered as \\"1312\\", after the alphabetical order of the letters. The slogan is associated with self- proclaimed dissidents who say they are subjected to political persecution and police brutality. Critics of this term contend that the linguistic nature of this term inherently attacks police officers as individuals and believe other terms should be used in its place to support police reform, while some proponents of the term say the intent refers to the police as an institution and does not necessarily reflect upon the individual law enforcement officer. Background Director Sidney Hayers used the phrase as the title of his 1972 crime drama All Coppers Are... and the Dictionary of Catchphrases states that while the initialism‚Äîlater seen in 1977 by a Newcastle journalist written on the walls of a prison cell‚Äîmay be no older than the 1970s, the full phrase may date back as far as the 1920s. Montreal police car spray-painted with \\"ACAB\\" during the 2012 Quebec student protests The acronym is often integrated into prison tattoos in the United Kingdom, commonly rendered as one letter per finger, alternatively sometimes seen as symbolic small dots across each knuckle. In Germany, usage of the term is a criminal offense when it refers to the honor of an individual, however, when used to describe a large group of people, it is permitted. In certain contexts, the Anti-Defamation League categorizes the phrase as a hate symbol and describes it as \\"a slogan of long standing in the skinhead culture\\", while noting the phrase is used both by racist and anti-racist skinheads. Prosecution history ACAB graffiti in Naples In Germany both \\"A.C.A.B.\\" and \\"1312\\" have been deemed insults by state courts. In 2015, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled in reference to the term \\"FCK CPS\\" (read as Fuck Cops) that an insult is only punishable when it is directed at a specific, identifiable group, but left interpretation of individual cases to the criminal courts. In Austria the use of A.C.A.B. was seen as \\"violating public decency\\", which could be punished under administrative law, for example, using an administrative penal order. The fine could be up to 700 euros (or alternatively a week police detention).¬≥ 1 Abs. 1 Z.1 WLSG. In 2019, the Austrian Constitutional Court (VfGH) ruled that punishing the slogan as a violation of decency, in certain cases, violates the fundamental right to freedom of expression under Article 10 ECHR. The specific case involved a soccer fan who had waved an A.C.A.B. flag in the stadium. According to the VfGH, the banner should \\"primarily refer to the tense relationship between some football fans and the police and to express the negative attitude towards the police as part of the state's regulatory power\\" and should therefore \\"not be a concrete 'insult' to certain other people\\". Therefore, the criticism expressed \\"should be accepted with a view to the special meaning and function of freedom of expression in a democratic society, taking into account all circumstances of the case\\". All Cats Are Beautiful In other European countries, there are examples of police action towards people using A.C.A.B. in some fashion. Brian Stableford's 2009 Exotic Encounters states that \\"many years ago\\" during a fad for wearing A.C.A.B. shirts, a British youth was arrested for incitement to riot for wearing one, and ineffectively claimed the shirt stood for \\"All Canadians Are Bastards\\". In January 2011, three Ajax football fans in the Netherlands were fined for wearing T-shirts with the numbers 1312 printed on them. On 4 July 2015, a girl in Alicante, Spain, was fined for wearing a T-shirt with the acronym \\"A.C.A.B.\\" printed on it. On 22 May 2016, a 34-year-old woman in Madrid, Spain, was charged under Article 37 of the Citizen Safety Law for carrying a bag displaying the acronym \\"A.C.A.B.\\" accompanied by the words \\"All Cats Are Beautiful\\". The charges were dropped 3 days later. On 15 September 2017, a man from Karlovac, Croatia posted a photomontage with the message \\"Fuck da Police A.C.A.B.\\" from his Facebook profile. For this, he was later charged with violating the public order and fined ‚Ç¨100 by the Misdemeanor Court in Karlovac. On 4 April 2019, a 26 year old ice hockey fan was arrested for wearing a T-shirt that had a numeric version of \\"A.C.A.B.\\", 1312. \\"A.C.A.B.\\" and 1312 are both considered \\"extremist information\\" in Belarus. However, this is not just a European phenomenon. In 2018, a group of Persija Jakarta football fans in Indonesia were arrested for displaying a banner with the message \\"All Cops Are Bastards\\" on it during the league match day. Other meanings CHWDP graffiti In punk, skinhead, and football culture there is the use of the term \\"eight cola eight beer\\" (German: 8 ColaBier). In addition, there is an antisemitic variant used by neo-Nazis: A.J.A.B. (All Jews are Bastards). There is also an anarchist variant, \\"Anarchist Chaotics Argue Better\\".

Residents of Jeju opposed to the Division of Korea had protested and had been on a general strike since 1947 against elections scheduled by the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK) to be held only in the territory controlled by the United States Army Military Government in Korea. The Workers' Party of South Korea and its supporters launched an anti-imperialist, communist-linked insurgency in April 1948, attacking the police, and Northwest Youth League members stationed on Jeju mobilized to violently suppress the protests. The First Republic of Korea under President Syngman Rhee escalated the suppression of the uprising from August 1948, declaring martial law in November and beginning an \\"eradication campaign\\" against rebel forces in the rural areas of Jeju in March 1949, defeating them within two months. Many rebel veterans and suspected sympathizers were later killed upon the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, and the existence of the Jeju uprising was officially censored and repressed in South Korea for several decades. The Jeju uprising was notable for its extreme violence with between 14,000 and 30,000 people (10% of Jeju's population) killed and another 40,000 fled to Japan. Atrocities and war crimes were committed by both sides, but historians have noted that the methods used by the South Korean government to suppress protesters and rebels were especially cruel, with violence against civilians by pro-government forces contributing to the Yeosu-Suncheon rebellion in South Jeolla during the conflict. Some historians and scholars, including military historian Allan R. Millett, regard the Jeju uprising as the authentic beginning of the Korean War. In 2006, almost 60 years after the Jeju uprising, the South Korean government apologized for its role in the killings and promised reparations. In 2019, the South Korean police and defense ministry apologized for the first time over the massacres. Background =Political situation in Korea= After Imperial Japan surrendered to Allied forces on 15 August 1945, the 35-year Japanese occupation of Korea finally came to an end. Korea was subsequently divided at the 38th parallel north, with the Soviet Union assuming trusteeship north of the line and the United States south of the line. In September 1945, Lt. General John R. Hodge established a military government to administer the southern region, which included Jeju Island. In December 1945, U.S. representatives met with those from the Soviet Union and United Kingdom to work out joint trusteeship. Due to lack of consensus, however, the U.S. took the \\"Korean question\\" to the United Nations for further deliberation. On 14 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed UN Resolution 112, calling for a general election on 10 May 1948, under UNTCOK supervision. Fearing it would lose influence over the northern half of Korea if it complied, the Soviet Union rejected the UN resolution and denied the UNTCOK access to northern Korea. UNTCOK nevertheless went through with the elections, albeit in the southern half of the country only. The Soviet Union responded to these elections in the south with an election of its own in the north on 25 August 1948. =Political situation on Jeju Island= Residents of Jeju island were some of the most active participants in the Korean independence movement against colonial Japanese occupation. Due to the island's relative isolation from the mainland peninsula, Jeju experienced relative peace after the Japanese surrender, contrasting with the period of heavy unrest in the southern region of mainland Korea. As with the mainland, the period immediately following the Japanese surrender was characterized by the formation of People's Committees, local autonomous councils tasked with coordinating the transition towards Korean independence. When the American military government arrived on Jeju in late 1945, the Jeju People's Council was the only existing government on the island. As a testament to this relative stability, the US military governor under the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) John R. Hodge stated in October 1947 that Jeju was \\"a truly communal area that is peacefully controlled by the People's Committee without much Comintern influence.\\" The Jeju People's Council had come under the directive of the South Korean Labor Party (SKLP) by late 1946. The SKLP encouraged the People's Council to establish military and political committees, as well as mass organizations. The 1946 USAMGIK dissolution of the provisional People's Republic of Korea and their associated People's Committees on the mainland sparked the Autumn Uprising of 1946, which did not spread to Jeju (as its PC still operated virtually unperturbed by the American military government) but did contribute to rising tensions on the island. Incidents leading up to the uprising = Sam-Il demonstrations = Residents of Jeju began protesting against the elections a year before they took place. Particularly concerned about permanently dividing the peninsula, the SKLP planned gatherings on 1 March 1947 to denounce the elections and simultaneously celebrate the anniversary of the March 1st Movement. An attempt by the security forces to disperse the crowds only brought more citizens of Jeju out in support of the demonstrations. In a desperate attempt to calm the boisterous crowd, Korean police fired indiscriminate warning shots above their heads, some of which went into the crowd. Although these shots successfully pacified the demonstrators, six civilians were killed, including a six-year- old child. = Chong-myon jail incident = On 8 March 1947, a crowd of about a thousand demonstrators gathered at the Chong-myon jail, demanding the release of SKLP members the military government had arrested during the Sam-Il demonstrations. When the demonstrators started throwing rocks and subsequently rushed the jail, the police inside shot at them in a panic, killing five. In response, SKLP members and others called on the military government to take action against the police officers who fired on the crowd. Instead, 400 more police officers were flown in from the mainland, along with members of an extreme right-wing paramilitary group known as the Northwest Youth League. Although both the police and paramilitary groups employed violent and harsh tactics in their suppression of the locals, the Northwest Youth League was especially ruthless, described as borderline terroristic. = February 1948 general strike = As the 10 May 1948 elections approached, SKLP leaders hardened in their opposition to the involvement of UNTCOK in Korean affairs, as they believed the elections would concretise the 38th parallel partition as a border, rendering a unified, independent Korea much less likely. In January 1948, Pak Hon-yong, the leader of the SKLP, called on SKLP members south of the 38th parallel to oppose the elections by whatever means necessary, and called for a general strike to begin on 7 February. At this point, there were at least 60,000 members of the SKLP on Jeju, and at least 80,000 active supporters. These members and supporters not only went on strike but in some cases attacked government installations and engaged with police forces in open conflict. These engagements between SKLP guerrillas against rightist groups and police continued through March 1948. Rebellion = 3 April 1948 = Although skirmishes had been taking place on Jeju Island since early 1947, 3 April 1948 is considered as the day the Jeju uprising officially began. Some sources claim it came about when military police \\"fired on a demonstration commemorating the Korean struggle against Japanese rule,\\" igniting mass insurrection. Other sources, however, make no mention of this demonstration incident, and claim that SKLP plans to attack on 3 April had been in the works for some time. Whatever the case, around 02:00 around 500 SKLP guerrillas alongside up to 3,000 sympathizers attacked Northwest Youth League positions as well as 11 of the 24 police stations on the island, killing 30 police officers, specifically targeting those who were known to have previously collaborated with the Japanese. Lieutenant General Kim Ik-ryeol, commander of police forces on the island, attempted to end the insurrection peacefully by negotiating with the rebels. He met several times with rebel leader Kim Dal- sam of the SKLP but neither side could agree on conditions. The government wanted a complete surrender and the rebels demanded disarmament of the local police, dismissal of all governing officials on the island, prohibition of paramilitary groups, and the re-unification and liberation of the Korean peninsula. In the wake of these failed peace negotiations, the fighting continued. The U.S. military government responded to guerrilla activity by transferring another regiment to Jeju from Busan and deploying police companies, each 1,700 strong, from the southern provinces of the mainland. The guerrillas retreated to their bases in the forests and caves around Hallasan, an extinct volcano and the highest mountain in South Korea. On 29 April, the Korean, non-military, governor of Jeju province abandoned his post, defected, and joined the guerrillas. This caused many police officers, disillusioned by the atrocities they were ordered to commit against their own, to do the same. In response, U.S. military provincial governor William F. Dean ordered a purge of SKLP sympathizers from the ranks of the Korean Constabulary, and three sergeants were summarily executed. Fighting continued through the 10 May elections. During election week, the guerrillas \\"cut telephone lines, destroyed bridges, and blocked roads with piles of stones to disrupt communications.\\" The SKLP Women's League campaigned for residents to hide in the mountainous region controlled by guerillas the night before the election so they could not be brought out to vote at gunpoint, and thousands did. Many election officials even declined to show up. These campaigns, along with sporadic arson, violent demonstrations and attacks on three government installations on election day rendered the election useless. The turnout in Jeju was the lowest in all of South Korea, so low that the two seats reserved for Jeju province in the new national assembly were left vacant. Fearing an upsurge in guerrilla activities after they succeeded in getting what they wanted out of the election, General Dean requested a US Navy blockade of the island on 11 May, so that sympathizers from the mainland could not reach Jeju. The Navy sent the USS John R. Craig (DD-885) to enforce the blockade. = August 1948 underground elections and Yeosu rebellion = Although guerrilla activities waned during the summer months of 1948, they picked up again in August after the Soviet Union held elections north of the 38th parallel to form the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). In conjunction with these elections, the Workers' Party of North Korea organized \\"underground elections\\" for those wanting to participate south of the 38th parallel, including on Jeju Island. Although the turnout of these elections is disputed, they succeeded at emboldening SKLP military forces. In the months following the elections, conditions worsened to the point that Republic of Korea (ROK) officials decided to send the Fourteenth Regiment of the Korean Constabulatory, stationed near the southern port city of Yeosu, to Jeju Island to assist counter-guerrilla efforts. Not wanting to \\"murder the people of Jeju,\\" however, thousands of these troops mutinied on 20 October 1948, just as they were preparing to depart. They killed many of the high-ranking officers and former Japanese collaborators and seized Yeosu and surrounding areas before retreating into the areas around Jirisan mountain and setting up guerrilla bases, much as the Jeju guerrillas did while hiding out in Hallasan. Embarrassed by this incident, Syngman Rhee, the newly elected president of the ROK, intensified the government's efforts to stamp out the rebellion. On 17 November 1948, Syngman Rhee proclaimed martial law in order to quell the rebellion. During this period, ROK police forces engaged in numerous war crimes. One report describes the events of 14 December 1948 at a small Jeju village, in which ROK forces attacked the village and kidnapped many young men and girls. The girls were gang-raped over a two-week period and were then executed along with the young men. By the end of 1948, the ROK's harsh tactics and effective suppression campaigns had reduced the number of guerrilla forces to just 300. = SKLP's 1949 New Year offensive and the ROK's eradication campaign = On 1 January 1949, the guerrillas launched one last offensive against ROK police. They attacked at Odong-ni and Jeju City, but were beaten back by ROK police and driven to the island's interior mountains. ROK police pursued the guerrillas and continued to commit atrocities, including rounding up whole villages and killing them all. The ROK forces, now determined to destroy the remaining SKLP guerrillas, launched an eradication campaign in March 1949. During the campaign, 2,345 guerrillas and 1,668 civilians were killed. With the campaign now effectively over, the ROK held elections on Jeju Island to fill the province's empty seats in the National Assembly; Jeju Island was now effectively and symbolically under ROK jurisdiction. United States involvement At the beginning of the uprising, the island was controlled by the United States Army Military Government in Korea. Only a small number of Americans were present. Jimmie Leach, then a captain in the U.S. Army, was an adviser to the South Korean Constabulary and claimed that there were six Americans on the island, including himself, and that they could call on two small L-4 scout planes and two old minesweepers converted to coastal cutters, manned by Korean crews. On 8 March 1949, the US Armed Forces sent an investigation team headed by Colonel James A. Casteel to Jeju to investigate the causes of the rebellion. They summarized that the February 1948 Jeju general strike prior to the rebellion was caused by instigation by the South Korean Labor Party and hostility towards the police as a result of shootings. They also described the strike as \\"communist inspired\\" but participated by both the left and right in response to the March 1 shootings. By the spring of 1949 four South Korean Army battalions arrived and joined the local constabulary, police forces, and right-wing Northwest Youth Association partisans to brutally suppress protests. The combined forces quickly destroyed or disabled most of the remaining rebel forces. On 17 August 1949, the leadership of the movement fell apart following the killing of major rebel leader Yi Tuk-ku. The U.S. military later called the complete destruction of Jungsangan village a \\"successful operation\\". The National Committee for the Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident concluded that the U.S. Army Military Government in Korea and the Korean Military Advisory Group shared responsibility for the incident as it occurred under the rule of the military government and an American colonel was in charge of the security forces of Jeju. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. assumed command of the South Korean armed forces. Brigadier General William Lynn Roberts commanded Americans on Jeju. The U.S. military documented massacres but did not intervene. On 13 May 1949 the American ambassador to South Korea wired Washington that the Jeju rebels and their sympathizers had been, \\"killed, captured, or converted.\\" Stars and Stripes reported on the South Korean Army's brutal suppression of the rebellion, local support for the rebels, as well as rebel retaliation against local rightist opponents. During the Korean War Recreation of Daranshi cave massacre on Jeju Immediately after the North Korean invasion of South Korea, the South Korean military ordered \\"preemptive apprehension\\" of suspected leftists nationwide. Thousands were detained on Jeju, then sorted into four groups, labeled A, B, C and D, based on the perceived security risks each posed. On 30 August 1950, a written order by a senior intelligence officer in the South Korean Navy instructed Jeju's police to \\"execute all those in groups C and D by firing squad no later than September 6.\\" Aftermath In one of its first official acts, the South Korean National Assembly passed the National Traitors Act in 1948, which among other measures, outlawed the Workers Party of South Korea. For almost fifty years after the uprising, it was a crime punishable by beatings, torture and a lengthy prison sentence if any South Korean even mentioned the events of the Jeju uprising. The event had been largely ignored by the government. In 1992, President Roh Tae Woo's government sealed up a cave on Mount Halla where the remains of massacre victims had been discovered. After civil rule was reinstated in the 1990s, the government admitted that the events on Jeju Island took place. A decade later in 2006, the government of South Korea issued an official apology. In October 2003, President Roh Moo-hyun apologized to the populace of Jeju for the brutal suppression of the uprising, stating, \\"Due to wrongful decisions of the government, many innocent people of Jeju suffered many casualties and destruction of their homes.\\" Roh was the first South Korean president to apologize for the 1948 massacre. In March 2009, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission revealed that, \\"At least 20,000 people jailed for taking part in the popular uprisings in Jeju, Yeosu and Suncheon, or accused of being communists, were massacred in some 20 prisons across the country,\\" when the Korean War broke out. The commission reported 14,373 victims, 86% at the hands of the security forces and 14% at the hands of armed rebels, and estimated that the total death toll was as high as 30,000. Some 70 percent of the island's 230 villages were burned to the ground and over 39,000 houses were destroyed. Of the 400 villages before the uprising only 170 remained afterwards. In 2008, bodies of massacre victims were discovered in a mass grave near Jeju International Airport. Estimates of the overall deaths of the 1948-1950 uprising run as high as 100,000.Spencer C. Tucker, Enduring Controversies in Military History (ABC-CLIO, 2017), p. 672 In January 2019, the Jeju District Court overturned military court rulings that imprisoned Jeju Islanders, clearing the names of the 18 surviving plaintiffs and recognizing them as wronged victims of the Jeju April 3 Uprising and Massacre. At the 71st commemoration of Jeju uprising, 3 April 2019, the South Korean police and defense ministry apologized for the first time over the massacres. Controversy =Effort of truth ascertainment= Families of victims of the uprising and associated massacres, as well as various civic organizations, continuously attempted to openly discuss the uprising but the national government suppressed all materials and discussions, and even made the topic of the uprising illegal. The first published recollection in South Korea of the massacre was the 1978 novel Sun-i Samch'on (, \\"Uncle Suni\\") which is set during the event. However, it was swiftly banned by the ROK government and its author, Hyun Ki-young, was arrested and tortured for three days by the National Intelligence Service. However, on 23 November 1998, after the democratization of South Korea, former president Kim Dae-jung stated that \\"the Jeju uprising was a communist rebellion, but there are a lot of people who died under false accusations as innocents, so now we have to reveal the truth and clear their false charges.\\" On 26 December 1999, the National Assembly passed a bill, 'A special law for the Jeju uprising truth ascertainment and the regaining impaired reputation of the victims'. On 12 January 2000, the National Assembly legislated a law so the Korean government could begin conducting an investigation of the uprising. Due to this decision, it could be possible to expand the human rights of the residents of Jeju. On 15 October 2003, a truth ascertainment committee of the Jeju uprising was assembled according to the special law, and ascertained a fact-finding report of the Jeju uprising. In line with the finding of the committee, on 31 October 2003, former president Roh Moo-hyeon admitted that the brutal suppression of the uprising was a massive abuse of governmental power and made a public apology to the people of Jeju on behalf of the Republic of Korea. On the 71st anniversary of the event, the defense ministry and police under the Moon Jae- in administration apologized for the past government's role in the Jeju massacre.https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3004517/lives-were- sacrificed-south-korean-police-apologise-massacres =Controversy of the uprising= Some right wing groups, including the Wallganjosun (), and Jaehyanggooninhoe () argued that the Jeju uprising was led and instigated by the Workers' Party of South Korea. Kim Gwang-dong, the director of researching policy in Korea argued that though the fundamental characteristic of the uprising is 'subversion of the system', there are a lot of skewed and biased studies that criticize the Korean government's faults when suppressing the rebellion. He said \\"it was an armed struggle and revolt of the forces who advocate communism against forces who support liberal democracy.\\" A Presbyterian minister, Lee Jong-yoon spoke at a church in Seoul that \\"the Jeju rising was incurred by the leftist forces and they provoked the rebellion to disturb the May 10 general election\\". This statement was broadcast through the CTS channel. * On 20 November 2010, a chairman of an adjustment committee of past affairs, and a former new right, Lee Young-Jo argued that 'Jeju rising was apparent communist-led rebellion'. =Controversy about the legality of martial law= There are controversies about the legality of martial law which took effect on 17 November 1948. One side that thinks it is illegal argued that effectuating martial law before the enactment of martial law is illegal according to the first constitution of South Korea. The other side argued that martial law from the Japanese colonial era still existed at the time so there are any violence of the effectuating martial law. This part continued before 15 August 1948 and after the formation of the South Korean government. =Post-processing and debating the case= Although the report of the accident started in June 2000, it was found to be 14,028 victims, but it is expected that the number will be higher since there are either unidentified or unidentifiable victims. On the other hand, about 180 soldiers died in combat, and 140 policemen died in the 3 April incident. In 2003, South Korea's National Committee for the Investigation of the Truth concluded the U.S. army military government and the Korean military shared responsibility for the incident. On 31 October 2003, South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun offered an apology to the victims of the Jeju incident. On 28 March 2008, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology opened a chemical aid project in Bonggae- dong, Jeju as part of a joint compensation program for the Jeju April 3 incident. In January 2019, 18 survivors, who were formally charged with insurrection, have been acquitted more than 70 years after imprisonment. The Jeju District Court overturned military court rulings that imprisoned Jeju Islanders, clearing the names of the 18 surviving plaintiffs and recognizing them as wronged victims of the Jeju April 3 Uprising and Massacre. At the 71st commemoration of Jeju uprising, 3 April 2019, the South Korean police and defense ministry apologized for the first time over the massacres. In popular media * Jiseul is a 2012 South Korean film about Jeju residents during the uprising. * Zainichi Korean writer Kim Sok-pom wrote a novel titled Kazant≈ç (Volcanic Island) about the event; his work is seen as controversial in South Korea and he has been denied entry to the country twice (in 1980 and 2015). * Ïû†Îì§ÏßÄ ÏïäÎäî ÎÇ®ÎèÑ (Namdo (ÎÇ®ÎèÑ) cannot sleep) is a Korean popular song with words and music by Ahn Chi Hwan. This song contains the agony of the victims of Jeju uprising. In 2013, Soreyu choir from Tokyo, Japan sang this song. A choir member of the Soreyu, Saito Gathuki said, \\"Years ago, I recognized the 4.3 affair through the documentary of NHK. Because I am in a generation before war, I couldn't know about the war and Korea. But now, I get to know the tragedy of war and massacre since I visit [Jeju].\\" *The Island of Sea Women by Lisa See is set on Jeju Island, beginning during a period of Japanese colonialism in the 1930s, followed by World War II, the Korean War, and its aftermath, including great detail of the Jeju uprising.

Black separatism is a subcategory of black nationalism, stemming from the idea of racial solidarity, and it also implies that black people should organize themselves on the basis of their common experience of oppression as a result of their race, culture, and African heritage. There was a total of 255 black separatist groups recorded in the United States, as of 2019. Black separatism in its purest form, as a subcategory of black nationalism, asserts that black people and white people should ideally form two independent nations. Additionally, black separatists often seek their original cultural homeland. Black separatists generally think that black people are hindered in their advancement in a society that is dominated by a white majority. Black nationalism vs. black separatism There are similarities between black nationalism and black separatism. They both advocate rights for black people, but there are a few differences between them. All black separatists are black nationalists, but not all black nationalists are black separatists. Black separatists believe that black people should be physically separated from other races, primarily whites; black separatists would want a separate nation for black people. This is slightly different from black nationalists because black nationalists don't always believe in a physical separation of black people. In some form, black nationalists do believe in separation, but not physical separation. Black nationalists focus more on black pride, justice, and identity. Their belief is that black people should be proud of their own skin, heritage, and beauty. They also believe that there should be justice for black people especially in the United States. Examples of black nationalist organizations include the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party. Concepts Conceptual Breakdown of Black Separatism In his discussion of black nationalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the historian Wilson Jeremiah Moses observes that \\"black separatism, or self-containment, which in its extreme form advocated the perpetual physical separation of the races, usually referred only to a simple institutional separatism, or the desire to see black people making independent efforts to sustain themselves in a proven hostile environment.\\" Scholars Talmadge Anderson and James Stewart further make a distinction between the \\"classical version of Black separatism advocated by Booker T. Washington\\" and \\"modern separatist ideology.\\" They observe that \\"Washington's accommodationist advice\\" at the end of the nineteenth century \\"was for Blacks not to agitate for social, intellectual, and professional equality with Whites.\\" By contrast, they observe, \\"contemporary separatists exhort Blacks not only to equal Whites but to surpass them as a tribute to and redemption of their African heritage.\\" Anderson and Stewart add, moreover, that in general \\"modern black separatism is difficult to define because of its similarity to black nationalism.\\" Indeed, black separatism's specific goals were historically in flux and they also varied from group to group. Martin Delany in the 19th century and Marcus Garvey in the 1920s outspokenly called for African Americans to return to Africa, by moving to Liberia. Benjamin \\"Pap\\" Singleton looked to form separatist colonies in the American West. The Nation of Islam calls for several independent black states on American soil. More mainstream views within black separatism hold that black people would be better served by schools and businesses that are exclusively for black people, as well as by local black politicians and police.

This article describes the history of Yunnan, currently a province of the People's Republic of China. Prehistory Notable prehistoric finds include the Yuanmou Man, a Homo erectus fossil unearthed by railway engineers in the 1960s and determined to be the oldest known hominid fossil in China. Neolithic By the Neolithic period, human settlements existed in the area of Lake Dian, close to modern day Kunming, Yunnan's capital. The inhabitants used stone tools and constructed simple wooden structures. The Kingdom of Dian Bronze sculpture of the Dian Kingdom, 3rd century BCE.Yunnan, China. The Dian culture was distributed around the Lake Dian area and dated, though controversial, between the 6th century BC and the 1st century AD. The culture is divided into an early and a late phase. Under Emperor Wu, a series of military campaigns were dispatched against the Dian during the southward expansion of the Han dynasty. In 109 BC, the kingdom officially became a vassal state of the Han empire. Map of the Chinese Han dynasty, showing some influence on Yunnan's Dian Kingdom, which was situated near modern-day Kunming.  Han dynasty  In 109 BC, Emperor Wu sent General Guo Chang () south to Yunnan, establishing the Yizhou commandery. The commandery seat was at Dianchi county (present day Jinning). To expand the burgeoning trade with Burma and India, Emperor Wu also sent Tang Meng () to maintain and expand the Five Foot Way, renaming it \\"Southwest Barbarian Circuit\\" (). By this time, agricultural technology in Yunnan had markedly improved. The local people used bronze tools, plows and kept a variety of livestock, including cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs. They lived in tribal congregations, sometimes led by exile Chinese. In the Records of the Grand Historian, Zhang Qian (d. 113 BC) and Sima Qian (145-90 BC) make references to \\"Sendhuk\\", which may have been referring to an Indianised community taking the name from the Indus Valley (the Sindh province in modern Pakistan), originally known as \\"Sindhu\\" in Sanskrit. When Yunnan was annexed by the Han dynasty, Chinese authorities also reported a Sendhuk\\" (Indianised) community living in the area.Tan Chung (1998). A Sino-Indian Perspective for India-China Understanding. In 109 AD, the Han court established Yunnan county, a part of Yizhou () commandery. Because the county seat was south of Mount Yun (), the county was named \\"Yunnan\\" ‚Äì literally \\"south of Yun\\". Jin dynasty and the Northern and Southern dynasties period Chinese dynasties of Jin, Liu Song, Southern Qi and Northern Zhou maintain their rules around the commandery in the Kunming area. Southwest Yunnan and the eastern rugged, mountainous areas were still enjoying relative independence, ruled by tribal kings and chieftains with little Chinese influence.  Nanzhao Kingdom  In 649 AD the chieftain of the Yi Mengshe tribe, Xinuluo (), founded a kingdom () in the area of Lake Erhai. In the year AD 737, Piluoge () united the six zhaos in succession, establishing a new kingdom called Nanzhao. In 750, Nanzhao invaded the Tang dynasty. In retaliation, the Tang sent an army against Nanzhao in 751, but this army was soundly defeated at Xiaguan. In 754, another army was sent, this time from the north, but it too was defeated. Bolstered by these successes, Nanzhao expanded rapidly, first into Burma, then into the rest of Yunnan, down into northern Laos and Thailand, and finally, north into Sichuan. In 829, Chengdu was taken; it was a great prize, as it enabled Nanzhao to lay claim to the whole of Sichuan province, with its rich paddy fields. The Tang dynasty retaliated and by 873, Nanzhao had been expelled from Sichuan, and retreated back to Yunnan. Taking Chengdu marked the high point of the Nanzhao kingdom, and it was a watershed: from then on, the Nanzhao Kingdom slowly declined. n 902, the Nanzhao dynasty was overthrown, and it was followed by three other dynasties in quick succession, until Duan Siping seized power in 937 to establish the Kingdom of Dali.  Dali Kingdom  Dali was a Buddhist Bai kingdom. Established by Duan Siping in 937, it was ruled by a succession of 22 kings until the year 1253, when it was destroyed by an invasion of the Mongol Empire. The capital city was at Dali. In 1274 the Province of Yunnan was created, and the region has since been incorporated within China.  Yunnan under the Mongol Empire  The Mongols established regular and tight administrative control over Yunnan. In 1253 M√∂ngke Khan of the Mongol Empire dispatched the prince Kublai to take Yunnan. The Mongols swept away numerous native regimes, including the leading Dali kingdom. Later Yunnan became one of the ten provinces set up by Kubilai Khan. Kublai Khan appointed Turkmen Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar governor in Yunnan in 1273.John Man Kublai Khan, p.80 Before that, the area had been ruled by a local king and a Mongol prince under the Great Khan. The Yuan provincial authorities conferred various titles on many native chieftains, who were obliged to pay taxes. When the Mongols were expelled from China in 1368, Yunnan was thrown into chaos and anarchy for a number of years. The Ming dynasty defeated the last of the Yuan loyalists in 1381.  Ming dynasty  The newly proclaimed Ming dynasty did not send armies into Yunnan until 1381. The central government allowed the general Mu Ying, foster son of dynastic founder Zhu Yuanzhang, to set up a hereditary feudatory system in the province. Throughout the Ming, the Mu family developed tremendous influence in Yunnan. From the end of the 15th century, the Toungoo Dynasty in Myanmar began encroaching on Yunnan. In the 16th century Chen Yongbin, the governor of Yunnan, held back a Myanmar invasion. After the war, he built eight passes along the border in Tengyue subprefecture to mark the demarcation between the two countries.  Qing dynasty  A western drawn 1655 map of Yunnan. 'Front of Tibet' Map Painted by Wu Run-De in the 'Ding Wei' year after 1901, which would have been 1907. Political regions shown clockwise from top are Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, Xianluo (Thailand), Miandian (Burma), Budan (Bhutan), Yindu (India), Nebo'er (Nepal), and so-called 'Houzang' ('back of Tibet'). Note that Thailand, or Tai regions, are shown between Yunnan and Burma, on Yunnan's historically typically ill-defined western border. After the fall of the Ming in northern China, Yunnan became the last Southern Ming regime headed by Zhu Youlang. Supported by rebels-cum loyalists, he persisted in resistance against the Qing conquest even after the Qing capture of Kunming in 1659. Zhu and his men then fled into Myanmar to seek refuge in Ava, but were treated as prisoners. Zhu's armed followers savaged Upper Myanmar in an attempt to rescue him. General Wu Sangui, then still loyal to the Qing, invaded Myanmar in 1662 with a sizable army, and demanded Zhu's surrender. Although he hesitated, King Pye finally decided to hand Zhu over to avoid hostility. Wu Sangui later turned against the Manchus but died in 1678. Yunnan finally fell to the Qing army in 1681.  Pingnan Sultanate  Waves of conflict between the Muslim Hui people in Yunnan and the Qing government escalated into an all out rebellion in 1856. The rebels in western Yunnan under the leadership of Du Wenxiu became the major military and political center of opposition to the Qing government. They turned their fury on the local mandarins and ended up challenging the central government in Beijing. The rebellion successfully captured the city of Dali, which became the base for the rebels' operations, and they declared themselves a separate political entity from China. The rebels identified their nation as Pingnan Guo () and Du Wenxiu was styled Qa¬¥id Jami al-Muslimin ('Leader of the Community of Muslims'), but is usually referred to in foreign sources as Sultan, and ruled 1856 ‚Äì 26 December 1872. The sultanate reached the high-water mark of their power and glory in 1860. The Sultanate's power declined after 1868. The Chinese Imperial Government had succeeded in reinvigorating itself. By 1871, it was directing a campaign for the annihilation of the obdurate Hui Muslims of Yunnan. Though largely forgotten, the bloody rebellion caused the deaths of up to a million people in Yunnan. Many adherents to the Yunnanese Muslim cause were persecuted by the imperial Manchus. Wholesale massacres of Yunnanese Muslims followed. For a period of perhaps ten to fifteen years following the collapse of the Panthay Rebellion, the province's Hui minority was widely discriminated against by the victorious Qing, especially in the western frontier districts contiguous with Burma. During these years the refugee Hui settled across the frontier within Burma gradually established themselves in their traditional callings ‚Äì as merchants, caravaneers, miners, restaurateurs and (for those who chose or were forced to live beyond the law) as smugglers and mercenaries and became known in Burma as the Panthay.  Republican China  THE GATE OF CHOU-CHOU All of the first and second class cities in Yunnan are surrounded by high walls, and are entered through four or more picturesque gates. Following the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Yunnan came under the control of local warlords, who had more than the usual degree of autonomy due to Yunnan's remoteness. They financed their regime through opium harvesting and traffic. In Second Sino-Japanese War, Yunnan served as, among other things, a home base for the Flying Tigers and a refuge for people, especially university faculty and students, from the east. These had originally retreated to Changsha, but as the Japanese forces were gaining more territory they eventually bombed Changsha in February 1938. The 800 staff faculty and students who were left had to flee and made the 1,000 mile journey to Kunming. It was here that the National Southwest Associated University (commonly known as Lianda) was established. In these extraordinary wartime circumstances for eight years, staff, professors and students had to survive and operate in makeshift quarters that were subject to sporadic bombing campaigns by Japan. There were dire shortages of food, equipment, books, clothing and other essential needs, but they did manage to conduct the running of a modern university. Over those eight years of war (1937‚Äì1945), Lianda became famous nationwide for having and producing many, if not most, of China's most prominent academics, scholars, scientists and intellectuals. Both of China's only Nobel laureates in physics studied at Lianda.  People's Republic of China  A British 1909 map of British India and Burma showing Yunnan's typically ill-defined south and western borders. The establishment of the PRC brought gradual but definite consolidation to China's southwestern borders, solidifying what were previously murky claims to various regions. For example, Colonial French and English had been active at sites in neighbouring northern Laos, Vietnam and Burma, and even inside of modern Yunnan at sites like Tengchong and Gejiu. In fact, between 1904 and 1909 the French had built the long Sino-Vietnamese Railway which ran from Hanoi to Kunming via Hekou, with an offshoot to Gejiu. The English tried to match the French effort with the Yunnan‚ÄìBurma Railway, but failed to complete it prior to the outbreak of war, with the project ultimately abandoned. The PRC also saw a bitter Sino-Vietnamese War fought along Yunnan's south eastern border, which was properly demarcated only on 23 February 2009, with renewed agreements taking effect as late as 14 July 2010. In the southern region of Xishuangbanna, little or no Han dominance was felt as late as the end of the 19th century. This is illustrated by Otto E. Ehlers' (1855‚Äì1895) account of his walk from Rangoon to Jinghong, recording upon his arrival that the annual Chinese tribute mission from northerly Simao was in town and, whilst they were happy to allow him to stay on the south of the Mekong river, he was not to be lent assistance in crossing over. He had no trouble crossing with the aid of a local, regardless. References  Further reading  * Giersch, Charles Patterson (2006): Asian borderlands.

Compared to tennis, the court is smaller and has no doubles lanes, and the net is lower. Paddle tennis is played with a solid paddle as opposed to a strung racquet, and a depressurized tennis ball is used. The same court is used for both singles and doubles, with doubles being the dominant form of play. The smaller court size adds a strong emphasis and advantage to net play and creates a fast and reaction-based game. The game is gaining reputation and has spread out in Dubai and even Egypt, where local leagues and tournaments are organized frequently.  History  Paddle tennis began in 1915, with its development by an Episcopal minister, Frank Peer Beal, in lower Manhattan. Wanting to create recreational activities for neighborhood children, he got the city's parks and recreation department to lay courts in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village in 1915. The first tournament was held in 1922, and the United States Paddle Tennis Association (USPTA) was formed the following year. By 1941, paddle tennis was being played in almost 500 American cities. Although Frank Peer Beal is known as the game's inventor, Murray Geller, a player in the 1940s and ‚Äò50s, was instrumental in creating the modern game. Elected chairman of the USPTA rules committee, he wanted to make the game more appealing to adults and instituted features including an enlarged court and an underhanded serve. Scott Freedman has won the World‚Äôs Men‚Äôs Singles Paddle Tennis Championships 19 times, the World Men‚Äôs Doubles Championships 16 times, and the World Mixed Doubles 14 times. He wrote a book entitled Paddle Tennis and Tennis: Anyone Can Play.  Similar sports  Platform tennis is a similar sport, which was invented in 1928 in Scarsdale, New York, USA by James Cogswell and Fessenden Blanchard. The primary difference from paddle tennis is that the platform tennis court is 6 feet shorter, fenced by taut chicken wire off which the ball can be played. Platform tennis uses a solid sponge rubber ball and overhead serving is permitted. Platform tennis is popular in the Northeastern and Midwestern U.S., since the raised court (the platform) can be heated for winter play. Padel (not to be confused with \\"Paddle tennis\\") is also similar. Padel is typically played in doubles on an enclosed court about half the size of a tennis court. It is popular in Spain and Hispanic America. Pickleball is a similar sport invented in 1965 on Bainbridge Island WA. It uses a similar size court and paddle, but uses a plastic \\"whiffle\\" ball.  Rules  = The court = Paddle tennis courts are constructed of the same materials as tennis courts, or can also be placed on hard beach sand. The court measures 50 feet baseline- to-baseline and 20 feet across, with the service line 3 feet in from the baseline. This creates a service box of 10'x22'. The net is placed at 31 inches. On the west coast, a restraint line is drawn 12' back parallel to the net. When in use, all players must keep both feet behind the restraint line until after the player receiving the serve has struck the ball. All paddle rules are similar to tennis. Paddle tennis second serves also have to be bounced at least once in the other opponents side.  Summary  * Players: 4. Played in a doubles format. * Serves: Serve must be underhand. A second serve is allowed only in the event of a net ball that lands in bounds, as in tennis. * Score: Scoring method is the same as in tennis. Matches are best of five sets. * Ball: Tennis ball with reduced pressure. * Paddle: Solid with no strings. May be perforated. * Court: There are two styles of courts. East and West coast styles. * Walls: Walls or fences play the same role as in tennis, once the ball comes in contact with either the point is over.

Cullen (1884‚Äì1936) was an American entrepreneur and salesman known as the founder of the King Kullen grocery store chain, widely considered to be the first supermarket founded in America. He is recognized by the Smithsonian Institution as the inventor of the modern supermarket. History Cullen was born in 1884 as the child of Irish immigrants. He joined The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company in 1902 at the age of 18 and worked for the firm for 17 years. In 1919, Cullen joined Kroger Stores and worked for the company until 1930. While working at Kroger, he developed the idea of a supermarket. He wrote a letter to the president of Kroger, proposing a new type of food store with a focus on low prices, larger square footage, cash sales, no delivery service, and low rent locations with plenty of parking. In his proposal, Cullen suggested that this new type of store could achieve nearly ten times the volume and profits of the average Kroger or A&P; store. Cullen's letter went unanswered. Undaunted, and confident in his ability to see his idea become a reality, he quit his job and moved his family to Long Island to launch his own store. Cullen leased a vacant garage at the corner of 171st Street and Jamaica Avenue in Queens, just a few blocks from a busy shopping district. On August 4, 1930, King Kullen Grocery Company opened the doors to the world's first supermarket. The store carried a range of approximately 1,000 items, including automotive accessories and hardware, as well as groceries. Success was rapid. People came from miles around. To many of his customers, Cullen offered convenient and affordable food. Bold newspaper ads described the store as the \\"World's Greatest Price Wrecker.\\" The chain expanded rapidly in the price conscious environment of the Great Depression. King Kullen stores reused large older building, including abandoned factories and warehouses, in low-rent location on the borders of populated areas. Facilities were simple. Service was minimal. Shopping carts were used and national brands were emphasized. There was a no frill bargain environment that resonated with depression era customers. Ample, free parking was available in order to appeal to customers with automobiles and encourage them to purchase large quantities. By 1936 there were 17 King Kullen supermarkets turning-over approximately $6,000,000 annually. At the time Cullen had plans for faster national expansion and franchising. However, in 1936, at age 52, Cullen died suddenly following an appendix operation. Following his death, the rate of growth of the firm slowed. Legacy Existing grocery store retailers, including leading chains Safeway, Kroger and The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, found the supermarket concept easy to imitate. By 1934 there were 94 supermarkets in the United States. By 1936, the year of Cullen's death, there were 1,200 in 85 cities. By 1950 the number had increased to 15,000.Shopping Environments: evolution, planning and design, Peter Coleman, p40 King Kullen continued to grow and expand through the leadership of his wife and the support of family members. However, relative to competitors, this rate of growth has been slow. From 17 stores in 1936 the firm has grown to 52 stores in 2009 (effectively 35 stores in 73 years). King Kullen is today the 72nd largest supermarket chain in the United States, with 52 stores and US$940m in sales in 2009.Supermarket News 2010 Top 75, Jan 25,2010, p11 It is owned and operating by the third generation of his descendants.

History The town arose in 1946 by a merger of the settlements Mal√° Bytƒça (including Be≈àov and Mik≈°ov√°), Veƒæk√° Bytƒça and Hlin√≠k nad V√°hom. The first written reference to the town's main part Veƒæk√° Bytƒça dates from 1234 as terra Bycha.Chronol√≥gia mesta Bytƒça The settlement got its town charter in 1378. It was the seat of a feudal dominion and later a town with many craftsmen. In Hungarian, it was known as Biccse. Landmarks The town features a famous castle the Thurz√≥ Castle built as a water castle by Pongr√°c Szentmikl√≥si in the 13th century and rebuilt in the 16th century in Renaissance style by Ferenc Thurz√≥. The town also houses the Wedding Palace (built by Gy√∂rgy Thurz√≥ for his daughters' wedding) from 1601, which is the only building of this kind in Slovakia, Renaissance, Baroque and Classical bourgeoisie houses, an archive, and a museum (in the Wedding Palace). Demographics According to the 2001 census, the town had 11,150 inhabitants. 98.27% of inhabitants were Slovaks and 0.58% Czechs. The religious make-up was 90.87% Roman Catholics, 4.35% people with no religious affiliation and 1.51% Lutherans.

Adults are mostly white, with black flight feathers at the wingtips and lining the trailing edge of the wing. The central tail feathers are also black. The head is tinged buff-yellow, with a pale blue-grey bill edged in black, and blue- rimmed eyes. Young birds have mottled plumage in their first year, dark above and light below. The head is an intermediate mottled grey, with a dark bill. The birds gradually acquire more white in subsequent seasons until they reach maturity after five years. The species range over water above the continental shelf along the southern and eastern Australian coastline, from Steep Point in Western Australia to Rockhampton, Queensland, as well as the North and South Islands of New Zealand, Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands. Nesting takes place in colonies along the coastlines of New Zealand, Victoria and Tasmania‚Äîmostly on offshore islands, although there are several mainland colonies in both countries. Highly territorial when breeding, the Australasian gannet performs agonistic displays to defend its nest. Potential and mated pairs engage in courtship and greeting displays. The nest is a cup-shaped mound composed of seaweed, earth, and other debris, built by the female from material mainly gathered by the male. A single pale blue egg is laid yearly, though lost eggs may be replaced. The chick is born featherless but is soon covered in white down. Fed regurgitated fish by its parents, it grows rapidly and outweighs the average adult when it fledges. These birds are plunge divers and spectacular fishers, plunging into the ocean at high speed. They eat mainly squid and forage fish that school near the surface. The species faces few natural or man-made threats, and since its population is growing it is considered to be a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Taxonomy Sir Joseph Banks shot three Australasian gannets in New Zealand waters on 24 December 1769 off Three Kings Islands. The birds were cooked in a goose pie, which was enjoyed by the sailors, for Christmas the next day. Daniel Solander wrote a formal description, noting its differences from the familiar northern gannet, initially giving it the name Pelecanus chrysocephalus before crossing it out and changing it to Pelecanus sectator. Sydney Parkinson illustrated the bird as P. sectator, which was misread as P. serrator by later authorities. The species name has been translated as \\"sawyer\\", from serra \\"saw\\", and linked to the serrated bill. John Gould described specimens from the Derwent River and Actaeon Island in Tasmania as Sula australis in 1841. The binomial name Sula australis had already been used by J. F. Stephens for the red-footed booby. English zoologist George Robert Gray wrote of the species in 1843, initially using Gould's name but soon switching to Sula serrator, based on Parkinson's drawing. Although Gould stuck with S. australis, S. serrator became the preferred term over time. \\"Australasian gannet\\" has been designated as the official common name for the species by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). It is also known as Pacific gannet and, in Australia, as Australian gannet, diver (from its plunge-diving), booby, or solan goose. In New Zealand it is also known by the MƒÅori name tƒÅkapu or tƒÅkupu, a word of wider Polynesian origin for a gannet or booby. The Sulidae, the gannets and boobies, appeared about 30 million years ago. Early Sulidae fossils most resembled the boobies, although they were more aquatic, the gannets splitting off later, about 16 million years ago. The gannets evolved in the northern hemisphere, later colonising the southern oceans. The most ancient extant species may be the Abbott's booby, possibly the sole survivor of an otherwise extinct separate lineage. A 2011 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA suggests that the ancestor of the gannets arose around 2.5 million years ago before splitting into northern and southern lineages. The latter then split into the Cape and Australasian gannets around 0.5 million years ago. The three gannets are generally considered to be separate species forming a superspecies, though they have also formerly been classified as subspecies of the northern gannet (Sula bassanus).  Description  alt=Large white seabird in flight over the ocean An adult Australasian gannet is long, weighs , and has a wingspan. The two sexes are generally of a similar size and appearance, though a 2015 field study at Pope's Eye and Point Danger colonies found females to be 3.1% and 7.3% heavier respectively. Females also had a slightly larger ulna and smaller bill. The plumage is white with black flight feathers on the wings, and central rectrices of the tail. Some individuals have more extensive black plumage of their tail feathers. There is a sharp demarcation between light and dark plumage. Black primary feathers are more resilient to wear, which may explain the dark plumage of the wings. The head and hindneck are tinged buff- yellow. The colour is more pronounced on the head and during breeding season. The eyes have a light grey iris surrounded by a pale blue eye ring, and bare black skin on the face which merges into the bill. In adults, the bill is pearly grey with dark grey or black edges, and a black groove running down the length of the upper mandible. The four-toed feet are dark grey and joined by a membrane of similar colour. There are light green lines running along the ridges of the toes that continue along up the front of the legs. alt=Two large spotted brown seabirds on ground Fledglings are brownish-grey speckled with white overall. They have dark brown bills, bare facial skin and eyes, and dark grey legs and feet. Australasian gannets take 2‚Äì5 years to gain adult plumage. Over this period, the upperparts and underparts gradually whiten and the crown and nape become buff-coloured, but there is great variation in the age that mature plumage is seen. This species is distinctive and only likely to be confused with species that do not generally share its range. The Cape gannet is a rare vagrant to Australasian waters and has an all-black tail, while the masked and red-footed boobies are generally restricted to tropical waters. Although both have mostly white plumage, they lack the buff colouring of the head and have white tails. The masked booby has a blue-black face and less black on the wing, while the red-footed booby has red feet. = Call = The Australasian gannet is generally silent at sea and loud and vocal at the colony in the day and at times overnight during the breeding season. Its typical call is a harsh arrah-arrah or urrah-urrah, which is emitted upon approaching or arriving at the colony or as a threat. The calls can vary between individuals, and the female's call is lower pitched than the male's. Distribution and habitat The Australasian gannet is found from Steep Point in Western Australia, along the southern and eastern Australian coastline to the vicinity of Rockhampton in Queensland, as well as the North and South Islands of New Zealand, Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands. At sea, it is generally restricted to waters over the continental shelf, and may enter harbours, bays and estuaries, particularly in stormy weather. Over May and June, young gannets from New Zealand colonies disperse to the north and west, mainly flying north around the North Island and (to a lesser extent) via the Cook Strait. They generally reach as far as southeastern Queensland and Rottnest Island in Western Australia. Far-wandering gannets are occasional visitors to Marion Island and the Crozet Islands in the southern Indian Ocean, and have even reached South Africa where they have interbred with Cape gannets. Some immature gannets spend 3 to 4 years in Australian waters before returning to New Zealand, while others remain in New Zealand waters. =Breeding colonies= Breeding colony at alt=Coastline of cliffs, on one of which are a colony of numerous white seabirds seen from a distance. Breeding colonies are mostly on offshore islands, though several mainland colonies exist in Australia and New Zealand. Numbers of Australasian gannet have been increasing since 1950, although some colonies have disappeared and others have decreased in size. Between 1980 and 2000, the population in Australian waters increased from approximately 6,600 to 20,000 breeding pairs. The most recent comprehensive New Zealand census was in 1981, yielding an estimate of 46,600 pairs, estimated to have increased to around 55,000 pairs in 2006. Colony location is related to sea temperature, which in turn dictates the presence of fish. Many colonies have limited space and birds seek new locations once the nest sites in a colony are full, at this point often spilling over onto the mainland. In Victoria, there are colonies at Lawrence Rocks near Portland, and Pope's Eye and Wedge Light in Port Phillip near Melbourne. The colony on Lawrence Rocks increased from 200 pairs in 1873 to around 3,100 pairs in 1996‚Äì97, by which time all available space on the island had been filled. Gannets began roosting at Point Danger‚Äîthe closest point on the mainland itself‚Äîin 1995, and began nesting the following year after a fox-proof fence was erected around the site. The only nesting locale on mainland Australia itself, the Point Danger colony, has increased steadily, reaching 660 pairs in 1999‚Äì2000. Located northeast of Portsea, Pope's Eye is a low artificial semicircular stone breakwater. Gannets began breeding on manmade structures in Port Phillip in 1966, with three pairs at Wedge Light. By the 1999‚Äì2000 season, there were 507 pairs there, and on seven other artificial structures around the bay. In Tasmania, there are colonies at Eddystone Rock and Pedra Branca off the south coast, and in Bass Strait at Cat Island off Flinders Island, and Black Pyramid Rock off the northwest coast. The colony on Black Pyramid grew from 500 pairs in 1961 to 12,300 pairs in 1998. Eddystone Rock increased from 20 pairs in 1947 to 189 pairs in 1998, and Pedra Branca grew from 1000 pairs in 1939 to 3,300 pairs by 1995, but both these sites have little or no room for expansion. Conversely, the colony at Cat Island fell from an estimated 5‚Äì10,000 pairs in 1908 to negligible numbers by the turn of the millennium due to predation. In New Zealand, almost all breeding colonies are on or around the North Island. Gannet Island, offshore from Kawhia, was named by Captain James Cook in January 1770 for the gannets seen there and 8,003 pairs were counted in a 1981 census. Three Kings Islands, north-west of Cape Reinga, contained New Zealand's largest offshore gannet colonies, with 9,855 pairs across five smaller colonies in 1981; an aerial survey in 2014‚Äì15 found that it had shrunk to 6,402 pairs. Whakaari / White Island, offshore in the Bay of Plenty and comprising five smaller colonies, also saw a reduction in numbers, from 6,662 pairs in 1980‚Äì81 to 5,306 pairs in 2014‚Äì15. The colony at Cape Kidnappers in Hawke's Bay is thought to have been settled around 1850, with 100 pairs reported in 1885. It had 5,186 pairs counted in a 1981 census. Muriwai, near Auckland, comprises a mainland colony on Okatamiro Point, estimated at 1,385 pairs in 2016, while nearby Motutara (Pillar Rock) had 187 pairs. Gannets established a colony on Tikitiki Rock (Nine Pin Rock) in the outer Bay of Islands in 2007, which had around 70 pairs by 2017. A small colony was established at Young Nick's Head in 2008. On the South Island, gannets began breeding at the end of Farewell Spit in 1983, in an area known as Shellbanks‚Äîa 2 m (7 ft) high area of shells and driftwood interspersed with low vegetation: marram (Ammophila arenaria), sea rocket (Cakile edentula), velvety nightshade (Solanum chenopodioides) and sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus). Strong winds allow gannets to take off vertically most of the time, and the decline in commercial fishing in nearby Golden and Tasman Bays is thought to have increased food supply. The breeding area is cut off from the mainland by high tides, but can be badly impacted by storms. It grew by around 11% per year, reaching an estimated 3,900 pairs in 2011. Little Solander Island in Foveaux Strait hosts the southernmost gannet colony, around 20 pairs recorded on most visits between 1948 and 1986, with one count of 62 pairs in 1984 possibly anomalous. Behaviour The Australasian gannet is generally solitary when out at sea, though once a bird has found fish to hunt, other gannets may notice and join it. It is gregarious on land, nesting in colonies. Non-breeding gannets often form groups on the outskirts of the colony. Small numbers of gannets may remain around the colony site outside of the breeding season, using it as a roosting site. =Breeding and courtship= Courtship behaviour Gannet pairs form monogamous and long term bonds, and pairs may remain together over several seasons until one member dies, although they have been known to separate. The Australasian gannet is highly territorial when nesting, engaging in agonistic displays to mark their ground against neighbours and interlopers. In the bowing display, the male's head and beak point down, and its wings are held up and away from the body, yet folded backwards. He moves his head from side to side before bowing forwards. The male may escalate by lunging at an interloper, either with a closed or open bill, or proceed to locking bills and wrestling for an extended period. Fights can be fatal on occasion. A bird may engage in an appeasement display to calm an attacker by lowering its head and tucking its bill in its chest. alt=Large white seabird sheltering a squawking chick on the guano-stained ground Mated pairs engage in a fencing display when the male arrives back at the nest. The two birds stand breast to breast with wings spread and bills extended vertically. They fence and scissor with their bills rapidly, calling loudly at the same time. Fencing is interspersed with bill bowing. The birds generally follow this exchange with allopreening. Mated pairs also engage in sky- pointing, where a bird paces slowly with its neck and bill vertical and its wings partly raised. Copulation takes place after allopreening, the female shaking her head vigorously and the male biting her neck and climbing on her back and waving his wings before joining their cloacae. Afterwards the female preens the male, who slides off his partner and reciprocates preening. The breeding season is generally from July to February, with marked differences between locations. On Motukaramarama Island, the gannets return in mid-June, laying eggs between 20 July and 7 August. The chicks hatch from 10 October to 2 November and fledge from late December. At Cape Kidnappers, the gannets return in late July, laying eggs from early September to the end of October. The chicks fledge from early February. At Pope's Eye, gannets lay eggs between early August and December, the median and mean being laid in September. Younger parents tend to lay eggs later in the year than older parents. Within colonies, there is a wider variation in breeding dates compared to the northern gannet, thought to be due to the absence of a tight breeding 'window' from strongly seasonal weather. The preferred nesting sites are on flat or gently sloping ground or broad, flat ledges, on offshore islands, stacks or elevated areas on the mainland such as cliff-tops, generally between above sea level. The ground may be bare or bear low shrubs such as Coprosma, Mesembryanthemum, Bulbine or grasses. The nests themselves are cup-shaped mounds high with a deep basin, made from seaweed, plants, earth and debris from the sea. The males usually collect the materials and give them to the females, who construct the nests. One egg is laid that can weigh anywhere from , with an average of . Matt pale blue and with an elongated egg shape, it measures long by wide. The egg surface fades to a white when dry and it has a chalky coating. Generally, only one brood takes place each season, though eggs and chicks up to eight days old will be replaced if lost. Incubation takes 37‚Äì50 days and is done mainly by the female, keeping the eggs warm on top of its webbed feet. alt=Large seabird feeding fluffy white chick on the ground Newly hatched chicks are featherless and have black skin, their eyes opening at 2‚Äì3 days of age. They are covered with white down by two weeks old. The first proper feathers to appear are flight feathers, which appear between days 43 and 47. The chick becomes half-covered by feathers by 9 weeks of age. Young chicks are fed regurgitated semi-digested fish by their parents, who open their mouths wide for their young to fetch the food from the back of their throats. The young birds fledge 95‚Äì109 days after hatching, heading to a nearby clifftop and remaining there for anywhere from 6 hours to 3 days before flying. Weighing on average when born, they reach ‚Äîexceeding that of adult birds‚Äîby day 50 and by day 90. Unlike young northern gannets, juvenile Australasian gannets are able to fly by the time they fledge and have fully grown primary flight feathers. They have smaller fat reserves, which may reflect a poorer food supply. Young individuals return to the colonies when they are three years old, and begin breeding between four and seven years of age. The typical lifespan is estimated to be around 20 years. The maximum age recorded from banding has been 30 years 8.2 months; a bird tagged at Cape Kidnappers in January 1955 was found dead some away at Tangalooma in Moreton Bay, Queensland in September 1985. The longest distance travelled is ; a bird tagged at Lawrence Rocks was found washed ashore dead on the southeast coast of Mauritius. =Feeding= These birds are plunge divers and spectacular fishers, plunging from heights of up to 20 m (65 ft) into the ocean at high speed. They may dive from as low as 1‚Äì2 m (3‚Äì7 ft) above the surface at an angle to forage in water less than 3 m (10 ft) deep or in rough weather. They mainly eat forage fish which school near the surface, as well as cephalopods. Some local differences have been recorded: Australasian gannets at Farewell Spit mainly forage on coastal fish in water depths of less than , while those at Cape Kidnappers hunt more oceanic fish at water depths exceeding that. Birds also follow fishing vessels and trawlers to pick up discarded fish. Its bulk prevents it from hovering for a sustained period, but it can pause to examine the sea surface for fish. The pilchard (Sardinops sagax) is a preferred prey item as it is an energy-rich source of food; after pilchard mass mortality events, Australasian gannets were able to adjust by switching to anchovy (Engraulis australis) at Farewell Spit in 1996 and barracouta (Thyrsites atun) in Port Phillip Bay in 1998. They also consumed correspondingly larger numbers of anchovies to maintain their caloric intake as this species has fewer calories than the pilchard. The increased expenditure for poorer return could feasibly impact on breeding success. In 1995, patrollers recovered 648 dead gannets along beaches in Auckland West and Northland West. The cause was unknown, but the 1995 pilchard mortality event and unusually strong westerly and southwesterly winds in July and August 1995 were implicated. Other fish species reported eaten include kahawai (Arripis trutta), yellow-eye mullet (Aldrichetta forsteri), western Australian salmon (Arripis truttaceus), cape bonnetmouth (Emmelichthys nitidus), greenback horse mackerel (Trachurus declivis), yellowtail horse mackerel (Trachurus novaezelandiae), striped trumpeter (Latris lineata), New Zealand blueback sprat (Sprattus antipodum) and flyingfish of the genera Cheilopogon and Hirundichthys. Squid of the genus Nototodarus are among cephalopods eaten. Predators and parasites The southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus) has been recorded preying on an adult Australasian gannet by holding it underwater and drowning it. Eggs and chicks can fall victim to the kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) and Pacific gull (Larus pacificus), particularly if parent birds have been disturbed. External parasites include the feather mite species Morinyssus simplex‚Äîcollected from a museum skin of Australasian gannet‚Äîthe bird louse species Pectinopygus bassani, and the tick species Ixodes eudyptidis, the widespread Ixodes uriae and Carios capensis. Conservation status The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the Australasian gannet as a species of least concern, as the population is large and appears to be growing. There are possible impacts from commercial fishing, though this is probably low compared with other seabirds. Survival rates each breeding season can vary dramatically, most likely due to food availability and weather. More frequent El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation events lead to warmer water in Bass Strait, which gives rise to more fish and hence accounting for the increase in Australian waters. Gannets established a mainland colony on Young Nick's Head near Gisborne, after decoys of nesting birds and pre-recorded calls were broadcast to passing gannets in September 2008. Successful breeding was recorded at the site from the 2010‚Äì11 breeding season onwards. A similar effort to establish a colony on Mana Island led to the arrival of a single gannet, dubbed Nigel \\"no mates\\", who lived alone among the 80 decoys for several years until he was found dead in February 2018; in summer 2018, three more gannets arrived at the site. Gannets have been enticed to established breeding colonies by decoys at reserves on Motuora Island.  Relationship with humans  The MƒÅori were reported to have harvested young gannets for food, visiting Gannet Island in March. The white feathers of adult gannets were used to adorn canoes, and were worn by important members of the community. The bones were made into tools to apply facial moko (tattoos). Some mainland colonies have become tourist attractions, such as those at Cape Kidnappers, and Muriwai in New Zealand, and Point Danger in Australia. The gannets of Cape Kidnappers have featured on New Zealand stamps issued in 1958 and 2009.

The Pezinok antimony deposits are known for world-class kermesite specimens.Pezinok antimony deposits at Mindat.org Pezinok (; ; ; ) is a town in southwestern Slovakia. It is roughly northeast of Bratislava and, as of December 2018, had a population of 23,002. Pezinok lies near the Little Carpathians and thrives mainly on viticulture and agriculture, as well as on brick making and ceramic(s) production. History From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Pezinok, or at least its surroundings, was for the first time mentioned in 1208 under name \\"terra Bozin\\". During the next few centuries, the town changed from a mining settlement to a vineyard town. It gained status of a free royal town on 14 June 1647. Pezinok had its most glorious era of wealth and prosperity in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was also one of the richest towns in the Kingdom of Hungary. Its wealth was based on production of quality wines. In the 19th century, the town slowly began to industrialize: the first sulphuric acid factory in Hungary or the known brick works were established here. It boomed further after it was connected to railway. After the break-up of Austria-Hungary in 1918/1920, the town became part of newly created Czechoslovakia. In the first half of the 20th century, it was declining, the vineyard production was declining, forcing many inhabitants to emigrate. It is growing again after the end of World War II. The town was ethnically cleansed as its German-speaking minority was expelled. Geography and tourism Pezinok lies at an altitude of above sea level and covers an area of . It is located in the Danubian Lowland at the foothills of the Little Carpathians, around north-east of Bratislava. Another major city, Trnava, is located around to the east. A ski resort is situated on the Baba mountain. The neighboring Little Carpathians offer numerous hiking paths. All of the city forests are part of the Little Carpathians Protected Landscape Area. The Little Carpathians Museum (Malokarpatsk√© m√∫zeum), which is in a typical wine merchant's house in the centre of the town, was undergoing a major renovation in 2008 and promises to be one of the best small museums in Slovakia. It has the biggest collection of wine presses in central Europe, some of them gigantic wooden affairs dating from the early seventeenth century; the atmospheric old cellars of the building are partly given over to an exhibition of them. But Martin Hrubala, the deputy director of the museum, is keen to make the museum not just about the old but also the new: the entrance fee includes a wine tasting, accompanied by a sommelier. And the museum promises interactivity at a level unusual for Slovak museums. Visitors, for instance, as well as tasting wine will also get the opportunity to make their own. Pezinok seems to have been investing heavily in public facilities lately: the city museum, in a building opposite the Little Carpathians Museum, opened in 2003. It features a range of attractively presented local archaeological finds and a selection of stonework salvaged from nearby churches; labelling, however, is in Slovak only. And at the northern end of the city centre, next to a park which once formed its landscaped grounds, is Pezinok Castle.

EBO) is a complex of nuclear reactors situated 2.5 km from the village of Jaslovsk√© Bohunice in the Trnava District in western Slovakia. Bohunice NPP comprises two plants: V1 and V2. Both plants contain two reactor units. The plant was connected to the national power network in stages in the period between 1978 and 1985. The four power reactors are pressurized water reactors of the Soviet VVER-440 design. Annual electricity generation averages about 12,000 GWh. Upon development of a district heating supply network in the town of Trnava near Bohunice NPP, V2 switched to co-generation. Part of this system is a heat feeder line commissioned in 1987. In 1997 a heat feeder line to Leopoldov and Hlohovec was begun, branching off from the Trnava line. Bohunice A1 (shutdown) The A1 is another nuclear reactor situated on the Jaslovsk√© Bohunice site. On February 22, 1977 the A1 reactor suffered a major accident during refueling, rated INES-4. This reactor is currently undergoing a decommissioning and cleanup process. Bohunice V1 (shutdown) As a condition of accession into the European Union (2004) Slovakia was forced to deactivate the two reactors at the V1 plant. A provision in the accession treaty allowed for reactivation in case of an emergency. V1 plant was exempted from Slovensk√© Elektr√°rne sale to Enel and transferred to JAVYS, a national nuclear decommissioning company fully owned by the state. The first reactor was shut down at the end of 2006, the second on the last day of 2008. The Russia-Ukraine gas dispute in January 2009 disrupted natural gas supplies and electricity generation. On January 10, 2009 the Slovak government ordered the second reactor, then still undergoing a shutdown procedure, to be returned into power-generation-capable mode. Eventually, the reactor was not reconnected to the grid and the final shutdown was resumed. Bohunice V2 (operating) Bohunice V2 consists of two second generation VVER-440/213 and went online on August 20, 1984 and December 18th 1985, respectively. In November 2010 both reactors were uprated from 440 MW to 505 MW (gross electrical output) and operation is planned to be maintained until 2025. Bohunice V3 (planned) In May 2009 Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Czech PM Jan Fischer announced construction of a new reactor unit at Bohunice. A partnership of the Slovak Nuclear and Decommissioning Company (JAVYS) and the Czech energy company ƒåEZ will build the plant at a projected cost of around 3.7 billion Euros. The specification of new reactor has not been settled upon but will be rated at between 600 and 1,600 MWe. Four manufacturers have been mooted as possible suppliers: Mitsubishi, Atomenergoprojekt, Westinghouse and Areva. ƒåEZ is considering combining this project with their concurrent construction of the third and fourth reactors at Temel√≠n Nuclear Power Station. Such a contract would be worth between 7 and 10 billion Euros. The project of constructing a third and fourth reactor at Temel√≠n was cancelled by ƒåEZ in April 2013.

Sanford.Variety film review; June 16, 1976, page 18. The film features an international cast of stars including Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, James Coburn, Glenn Ford, Ed Nelson, Hal Holbrook, Toshiro Mifune, Robert Mitchum, Cliff Robertson, Robert Wagner, James Shigeta, Pat Morita, John Fujioka, Robert Ito and Christina Kokubo. The music score by John Williams and the cinematography by Harry Stradling Jr. were both highly regarded. The soundtrack used Sensurround to augment the physical sensation of engine noise, explosions, crashes and gunfire. Despite mixed reviews, Midway became the tenth most popular movie at the box office in 1976. Plot The film follows two threads; one centered on the Japanese chief strategist Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, and the other on naval aviators Captain Matt Garth and his son, Ensign Thomas Garth. After the Doolittle Raid and the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942, The Imperial Japanese Navy has been undefeated and outnumbers the American naval forces by four to one. The Japanese began the planning for the Battle of Midway, creating a complicated battle plan. Unknown to the Japanese, American signals intelligence has broken the Japanese Naval encryption codes and suspects that the ambush will take place at Midway Island. They then trick the Japanese into confirming it. Senior officer Matt Garth is involved in various phases of the US planning and execution of the battle, while pilot Thomas Garth is romantically involved with Haruko Sakura, an American-born daughter of Japanese immigrants, who has been interned with her parents. Captain Garth calls in all of his favors with a long-time friend to investigate the charges against the Sakuras. American Admiral Chester Nimitz plays a desperate gamble by sending his last remaining aircraft carriers to Midway before the Japanese to set up his own ambush. The gamble pays off and all four of the Japanese carriers are destroyed in the battle of Midway. Captain Garth himself is killed at the end of the battle when his plane crashes, while the injured younger Garth is carried off the ship, seen by a free Haruko at the dockside, indicating Captain Garth had some success in investigating the charges against the Sakuras. Successful in saving Midway, but at a heavy cost, Nimitz reflects that Yamamoto \\"had everything going for him\\", asking \\"were we better than the Japanese, or just luckier?\\" Cast * Charlton Heston as Captain Matthew Garth * Henry Fonda as Admiral Chester W.

We built an airstrip, a tower, some barricades, things like that,\\" said Jack Smight. \\"We did a lot of strafing and bombing there.\\"Newspaper Enterprise Association, \\"Filming of 'Midway': Making War for the Movies\\", Playground Daily News, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Wednesday 8 October 1975, Volume 30, Number 209, page 5B. A Consolidated PBY-6A Catalina BuNo 63998, N16KL, of the Commemorative Air Force, was used in depicting all the search and rescue mission scenes. =Sound= The film was the second of only four films released with a Sensurround sound mix which required special speakers to be installed in movie theatres. The other Sensurround films were Earthquake (1974), Rollercoaster (1977), and Battlestar Galactica (1978). The regular soundtrack (dialog, background and music) was monaural; a second optical track was devoted to low frequency rumble added to battle scenes and when characters were near unmuffled military engines. =Action= Many of the action sequences used footage from earlier films: most sequences of the Japanese air raids on Midway are stock shots from 20th Century Fox's Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). Some scenes are from the Japanese Toho film Hawai Middouei daikaikusen: Taiheiyo no arashi (1960) (which also stars Mifune). Several action scenes, including the one where a Mitsubishi A6M Zero slams into 's bridge, were taken from Away All Boats (1956); scenes of Doolittle's Tokyo raid at the beginning of the film are from Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944). In addition, most dogfight sequences come from wartime gun camera footage or from the film Battle of Britain (1969). Cast member Henry Fonda (Admiral Nimitz) had been one of the narrators of the 1942 John Ford documentary The Battle of Midway, some footage from which was used in the 1976 film. This was the third film dealing with the aftermath of Pearl Harbor with which Henry Fonda had been involved. Henry first narrated the 1942 film The Battle of Midway and starred in the 1965 film In Harm's Way. The only actress with a speaking part in the original film was Christina Kobuko as Horuko. In the TV version of the film Susan Sullivan appears playing Matt Garth's girlfriend. Later video versions dropped Sullivan to emphasize the essentially all-male cast and wartime action. Storm Over the Pacific (Â§™Âπ≥Ê¥ã„ÅÆÂµê Taiheiyo no arashi), 1960). As with many \\"carrier films\\" produced around this time, the US Navy Essex-class aircraft carriers USS Lexington and USS Boxer played the parts of both American and Japanese flattops for shipboard scenes.

Bombs explode and planes crash and the theater shakes with the magic of Sensurround. But there's no real directorial intelligence at hand to weave the special effects into the story, to clarify the outlines of the battle and to convincingly account for the unexpected American victory.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that \\"the movie blows up harmlessly in a confusion of familiar old newsreel footage, idiotic fiction war movie clich√©s, and a series of wooden-faced performances by almost a dozen male stars, some of whom appear so briefly that it's like taking a World War II aircraft-identification test.\\"Canby, Vincent (June 19, 1976). \\"On Film, the Battle of 'Midway' Is Lost\\".

Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that \\"[t]he battle scenes run hot and cold.\\" He praised Henry Fonda as \\"absolutely convincing\\" but stated that Sanford \\"deserves a year in the brig for inserting amid the battle scenes a stupid subplot involving a young American sailor in love with a Japanese-American girl.\\"Siskel, Gene (June 21, 1976). \\"Decisive U.S. sea battle flounders in Hollywood\\".

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 54% score based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. =Television version= Shortly after its successful theatrical debut, additional material was assembled and shot in standard 4:3 ratio for a TV version of the film, which aired on NBC. A major character was added: Susan Sullivan played Ann, the girlfriend of Captain Garth, adding depth to his reason for previously divorcing Ensign Garth's mother, and bringing further emotional impact to the fate of Captain Garth. The TV version also has Coral Sea battle scenes to help the plot build up to the decisive engagement at Midway. The TV version was 45 minutes longer than the theatrical film and aired over two nights. Mitchell Ryan was added as Rear Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch. Jack Smight directed the additional scenes.. In June 1992, a re-edit of the extended version, shortened to fill a three-hour time slot, aired on the CBS network to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Midway battle. This version brought in successful ratings. Part of this additional footage is available as a bonus feature on the Universal Pictures Home Entertainment DVD of Midway. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers ‚Äì Nominated  Historical accuracy  The plot follows the real battle remarkably well. Even though simplified, omitting details here and there did not distort the story. Such details, among others, were reduced: * More flag officers took part at the decision making and planning before the battle, not just Nimitz, Fletcher and Spruance. All the same, commanding officers' staffs were generally bigger than the one or two men portrayed in the movie. * Admiral King, commander-in- chief of the navy at that time, approved the Midway battle plan propounded by Nimitz. They were regularly in contact, so there was no need of sending fictional Capt. Vinton Maddox to consult Nimitz (apart from enabling James Coburn to star in the movie). * There were numerous air attacks by Midway- based bombers on approaching Japanese fleets completely omitted in the script. However, these had the same effect as later carrier-based torpedo bombers decimated by Japanese fleet air-defenses portrayed in the movie. Lack of impact from initial raids by land-based bombers only convinced Japanese commanders of their invincibility and incompetency of US military. * The film omits that the Japanese destroyer that inadvertently guided US attack planes to Nagumo's carriers had unsuccessfully depth-charged U.S. submarine , which had unsuccessfully attacked the battleship . During the American torpedo attacks, Admiral Ch≈´ichi Nagumo and his subordinates are shaken by the American pilots' unexpected bravery. Nagumo remarks \\"They sacrifice themselves like samurai, these Americans\\". Similar to Isoroku Yamamoto's sleeping giant quote from the 1970 film Tora! Tora! Tora!, there is no evidence that Nagumo made this statement. When the Akagi is bombed, Nagumo is stunned by the force of the bomb's blast, and is unable to get up, being tended to by Genda. A subordinate quietly asks, \\"Admiral, you must transfer your flag. The cruiser Nagara is close by.\\"Nagumo, in a weak voice, says \\"Advise Admiral Yamaguchi\\". In real life, Nagumo would have certainly experienced hard knocks while being tossed about the carrier as the explosions went off around him. The buffeting he encountered during the bombing, as well as the loss of two of his carriers would have left him in no condition to exert even his remaining confidence in victory. However, Nagumo was certainly not stunned by the blast, and unable to get up. Witnesses saw Nagumo standing near the ship‚Äôs compass looking out at the flames on his flagship and two other carriers in a state of shock. Additionally, despite being asked to transfer his flag, Nagumo initially didn‚Äôt move and was reluctant to leave the Akagi, just muttering, ‚ÄúIt's not time yet,‚Äù. Nagumo's chief of staff, Rear Admiral Ry≈´nosuke Kusaka, was able to persuade him to leave the critically damaged Akagi. Nagumo, with a barely perceptible nod, with tears in his eyes, agreed to go. . However rather than transferring direct to the light cruiser, Nagumo initially transferred to the destroyer Nowaki. Later studies by Japanese and American military historians call into question key scenes, like the dive-bombing attack that crippled the first three Japanese carriers. In the movie, American pilots report, \\"They've got bombs stacked all over their flight deck! We caught 'em flat-footed! No fighter cover; decks loaded with bombs!\\" As Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully write in \\"Shattered Sword\\" (2005), aerial photography from the battle showed nearly empty decks. In addition, Japanese carriers loaded armament onto planes below the flight deck, unlike American carriers (as depicted earlier in the film). The fact that a closed hangar full of armaments was hit by bombs made damage to Akagi more devastating than if planes, torpedoes and bombs were on an open deck.Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully (2005). \\"Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway\\" (pp. 431-432). Potomac Books, Washington, DC. . During the attack on the Japanese carriers, an American pilot reports, \\"Scratch one flat top!\\" This is a famous radio transmission but it was made one month earlier during the Battle of the Coral Sea by Lieutenant Commander Robert E. Dixon after his dive bomber squadron sunk the . While most characters portray real persons, some of them are fictional though inspired by actual people. Captain Matt Garth and his son, Ensign Thomas Garth, are both fictional characters. Captain Matthew Garth's contribution to planning the battle is based rather faithfully on actual work of Lieutenant-Commander Edwin Layton. Layton served as Pacific fleet intelligence officer. He spoke Japanese and was key to transposing raw outputs of cryptography analysis into meaningful intelligence for Nimitz and his staff. Layton was long-time friend of Joseph Rochefort. Matt Garth's further exploits were pure fiction and resembled deeds of at least two more persons. First, an intelligence officer at Adm. Fletcher's Task Force 17 staff and then the leader of the last attack made by dive bombers from USS Yorktown. The latter, however, was actually performed by VB-3 dive bomber squadron led by LCDR Maxwell Leslie. Matt Garth's character thus combine three actual people involved in the battle. While this is reasonable for the sake of storytelling, it could not have happened as it was unimaginable to put such a valuable officer as fleet intelligence officer in harm's way. Besides, Layton was not a flyer. Historical footage and atelier shots of warplanes action are mostly inaccurate in the movie. Most of the original footage portrays later and/or different events and thus planes and ships that were not operational during the battle or did not take part. Among the first aircraft shown taking off to defend Midway are two Army P-40 Warhawks. There were no P-40s stationed at Midway, only Marine F4F Wildcats and F2A-3 Buffalos. In the second air attack on Yorktown, the movie shows two Japanese planes hitting the aircraft carrier. There were no plane crashes into ships in this battle. One of the most flagrant moments is Matt Garth's collision at the very end of the movie, which is followed by the recording of a post-war jet plane crash which actually occurred on USS Midway. Like the USS Lexington used in filming, USS Midway is also preserved as a museum.

In Europe and the Near East, the end of antiquity is often equated with the Fall of Rome in 476 AD, the wars of the Eastern Roman Empire on its Southwestern Asian and North African borders, and the beginnings of the Muslim conquests in the 7th century. In China, it can also be seen as ending of the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever-growing threat from the north in the 5th century and the beginning of the Tang dynasty in 618 AD. In India, the ancient period ends with the decline of the Gupta Empire (6th century) and the beginning of the Muslim conquests there from the 8th century. In Japan, the ancient period is considered to end with the rise of feudalism in the Kamakura period in the 12‚Äì13th century. The difference between prehistoric and ancient warfare is more organization oriented than technology oriented. The development of first city-states, and then empires, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in Mesopotamia, states produced sufficient agricultural surplus. This allowed full-time ruling elites and military commanders to emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time. These new armies were able to help states grow in size and become increasingly centralized. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use bows and spears, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. The findings at the site of Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, have been interpreted as evidence of inter-group conflict and warfare in antiquity, but this interpretation has been challenged. Early armies in Egypt and China followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears. Infantry at this time was the dominant form of war, partially due to the camel saddle and the stirrup not being invented yet. The infantries at this time would be divided into ranged and shock, with shock infantry either charging to cause penetration of the enemy line or hold their own. These forces would ideally be combined, thus presenting the opponent with a dilemma: group the forces and leave them vulnerable to ranged, or spread them out and make them vulnerable to shock. This balance would eventually change as technology allowed for chariots, cavalry, and artillery to play an active role on the field. No clear line can be drawn between ancient and medieval warfare. The characteristic properties of medieval warfare, notably heavy cavalry and siege engines such as the trebuchet were first introduced in Late Antiquity. The main division within the ancient period is at the beginning Iron Age with the introduction of cavalry (resulting in the decline of chariot warfare), of naval warfare (Sea Peoples), and the development of an industry based on ferrous metallurgy which allowed for the mass production of metal weapons and thus the equipment of large standing armies. The first military power to profit from these innovations was the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which achieved a hitherto unseen extent of centralized control, the first \\"world power\\" to extend over the entire Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia, the Levant and Egypt).  Chariots  As states grew in size, the speed of mobilization became crucial because central power could not hold if rebellions could not be suppressed rapidly. The first solution to this was the chariot, which was initially used in the Middle East from around 1800 BC. First pulled by oxen and donkeys, they allowed rapid traversing of the relatively flat lands of the Middle East. The chariots were light enough that they could easily be floated across rivers. Improvements in the ability to train horses soon allowed them to be used to pull chariots, possibly as early as 2100 BC, and their greater speed and power made chariots even more efficient. The major limitation of the use of chariots was terrain; while very mobile on flat, hard, open ground, it was very difficult to traverse more difficult terrain, such as rough ground, even sparse trees or bushes, small ravines or streams, or marsh. In such terrain, chariots were less maneuverale than common foot soldiers, and later cavalry. The chariot was so powerful for transportation and warfare that it became the key weapon in the Ancient Near East in the 2nd millennium BC. The typical chariot was worked by two men: one would be a bowman who would fire at enemy forces, while the other would control the vehicle. Over time, chariots were developed to carry up to five warriors. In China, chariots became the central weapon of the Shang dynasty, allowing them to unify a great area. Although chariots have been compared to modern-day tanks in the role they played on the battlefield, i.e. shock attacks, this is disputed, with scholars pointing out that chariots were vulnerable and fragile, and required a level terrain while tanks are all- terrain vehicles; thus chariots were unsuitable for use like modern tanks as a physical shock force. The chief advantage of the chariot was the tactical mobility they provided to bowmen. Tightly packed infantry was the formation of choice, in order for ancient generals to maintain command and control during the battle as well as for mutual protection. But a force of chariots could stand off at long range and rain arrows down on the infantrymen's heads. Because of their speed, any attempts to charge the chariots could be easily evaded. If, on the other hand, an infantry unit spread out to minimize the damage from arrows, they would lose the benefit of mutual protection and the charioteers could easily overrun them. Thus any force facing chariots was in a tactical dilemma, making chariots indispensable to armies of those times. But they were complicated equipment that required specialized craftsmen to maintain them. This made chariots expensive to own. When chariots were owned by individuals within a society, it tended to give rise to a warrior class of specialists and a feudal system (an example of which can be seen in Homer's The Iliad). Where chariots were publicly owned, they helped in the maintenance and establishment of a strong central government, e.g. the New Egyptian Kingdom. Chariot usage peaked in the Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC, which was probably the largest chariot battle ever fought, involving perhaps 5,000 chariots.  Naval warfare  Naval warfare in the ancient world can be traced back to the Mediterranean in the third millennium BC, from evidence of paintings in the Cyclades and models of ships which were made across the Aegean. Ships were used for civilian transport and trade, as well as for military purposes. They were propelled by both rowing and sailing, but since the Mediterranean is known for its inconsistent weather patterns, rowing was probably the primary means of propulsion. The first documented, physical evidence of a naval battle is found in a relief painting located in the temple of Medinet Habu, near Luxor, Egypt. It shows the victory of Ramses III over the 'Sea-Peoples' in the Nile river delta in the early twelfth century BC. These 'Sea-Peoples' were originally believed to be of Philistine and Phoenician descent, while there is speculation that there could be some Greek influence in their seafaring. Even before this relief painting, there are earlier records of the practice of sea battles as early as 2550 BC under the Egyptian Pharaoh Sahue, who reportedly used transport vessels to escort his armies to foreign shores. There is even further evidence from earlier sources that illustrate seafaring and military action around the Nile Delta during the early dynastic period in Egypt, following into the reign of Ramses II Before that victory of Ramses III, the state of Egypt had no access to the kind of timber needed to build seafaring vessels and warships on a large scale. Instead of importing large quantities of timber to build warships, Egyptian naval architects and early engineers began to convert the common Egyptian riverboats. They reconfigured the size of the ship and added heavy trees for longitudinal support of the hull on the open sea. The warships constructed in this way contributed to that victory. The relief painting shows in great detail how fighting was conducted in a naval battle. It shows Egyptian warships with over twenty rows of oarsmen along with infantry troops and archers fighting in apparent hand-to-hand combat with the opposing naval force. This raises a question to the theory that there was no actual naval weaponry developed at this time but rather a reliance upon maneuvering tactics and strategy in order to engage with infantry troops. = The trireme = Among the great innovations of naval warfare in the ancient world there are few that can surpass the Trireme style warship in terms of efficiency, strategy, and overall effectiveness. The first depiction of this 'longship' style vessel can be found in Homer's The Iliad as a means of transport of armed men and supplies to areas of conflict across the seas. These ships were said to have consisted of two separate levels that could have held up to 60 men per level, all operating oars in unison to propel the ship. The upper level of oarsmen would sit in single-file fashion, pulling their oars through what is called a top wale or some sort of oar-port; while the men in the lower rows would sit in the ships' hold also rowing through lower oar-ports. It is also said that each oar throughout the ship would be made in length proportionate to the physique of an average Greek man. reconstruction of ancient Greek Trireme Manned crews for these massive warships would have been quite impressive, but accounts vary in actual numbers of men from source to source. Herodotus of Halicarnassus was a Greek historian in the fourth century BC who, through his accounts, said that these Triremes would consist of at least two-hundred men manning all positions. With these massive crews, these ships were able to work at maximum capacity and efficiency in regards to speed, navigation, and transport. While these ships were built for maximum efficiency, there is room for debate about the conditions and space aboard the ship itself. It is estimated that out of the 200 man crew, around 170 of those men would have been oarsmen with respective positions below deck. These oarsmen below deck would sit on thwarts and kept their personal storage items beneath them, reassuring the theory that these ships would be very crowded with little room for anything other than operational functions. What exactly these Greek triremes were capable of in battle is debated. There are various different accounts that lay down foundations of what equipment was used and how these ships engaged in combat. The main military applications of Greek Triremes, besides the transport of troops and supplies, would be the advantages of ramming tactics. Developments and innovations of the Greek Trireme evolved over time, especially in respect to ramming tactics. Naval architects during this time saw fit to bring about full effectiveness and damaging power to these ships. By doing this, the amount of manpower would stay consistent, i.e., keeping the same amount of rowing power but shortening the length of the ship to condense the ramming power while keeping speed and agility consistent. This new ideology of warfare and naval tactics would prove to be prudent to the overall military applications of the Trireme, and soon would become the principal combative strategy of the Greek navy and other navies alike. The Greek Trireme, soon after its appearance in the Aegean, would become the standard warship throughout the Mediterranean as sovereign states such as Egypt and even the Persian Empire would adopt the design of these ships and apply them to their own military applications. One major attraction of the Greek design was not only its efficient ramming capability but also its ability to travel long distances at fair speeds. One account from the Athenian soldier and historian Xenophon describes the voyage of the Athenian fleet commander Iphicrates through unfriendly waters and the strategy he used combined with the sheer sailing power of the Trireme. > \\"He proceeded with his journey and at the same time made all the necessary > preparations for action, at the outset leaving his main sails behind as if > he was expecting an engagement. In addition, even if there was a following > wind he used his small [boat] sails little, but progressed by oar [instead, > presumably, of using main sails and boat sails when the wind was > favourable]. Thus he both improved the fitness of his men and achieved a > higher speed for his ships\\". This primary source account can be interpreted as functional and efficient use of the Greek trireme. Maximizing its speed through rugged and unfriendly seas while also utilizing specific military strategy in order to ensure the most prudent and effective outcome was what led to the success of the trireme across all kinds of empires and civilizations throughout the Mediterranean. The trireme would later become a vital piece of naval weaponry throughout the Persian Wars, for both the Greeks and the Persian Empire, as well as the base standard for the formation of the Roman Navy. The Persian Wars were the first to feature large-scale naval operations: not only sophisticated fleet engagements with dozens of triremes on each side, but also combined land-sea operations. Ships in the ancient world could operate only on the relatively quiet waters of seas and rivers; the oceans were off-limits. Navies were almost always used as auxiliaries to land forces, often essential to bringing them supplies. They would rarely strike out on their own. With only limited- range weapons, naval galleys would often attempt to ram their opponents with their reinforced bow to cause damage or sink the enemy warships which often caused the two ships to become joined together, and initiated a boarding battle. Only occasionally was a decisive naval battle fought, such as the Battle of Lade in which a Persian navy destroyed the Greek navy.  Tactics and weapons  = Strategy = Ancient strategy focused broadly on the twin goals of convincing the enemy that continued war was more costly than submitting, and of making the most gain possible from war. Forcing the enemy to submit generally consisted of defeating their army in the field. Once the enemy force was routed, the threat of siege, civilian deaths, and the like often forced the enemy to the bargaining table. However, this goal could be accomplished by other means. Burning enemy fields would force the choice of surrendering or fighting a pitched battle. Waiting an enemy out until their army had to disband due to the beginning of the harvest season or running out of payment for mercenaries presented an enemy with a similar choice. The exceptional conflicts of the ancient world were when these rules of warfare were violated. The Spartan and Athenian refusal to accept surrender after many years of war and near bankruptcy in the Peloponnesian War is one such exceptional example, as is the Roman refusal to surrender after the Battle of Cannae. A more personal goal in war was simple profit. This profit was often monetary, as was the case with the raiding culture of the Gallic tribes. But the profit could be political, as great leaders in war were often rewarded with government office after their success. These strategies often contradict modern common sense as they conflict with what would be best for the states involved in the war. = Tactics = Effective tactics varied greatly, depending on: # The army's size # Unit types # Terrain # The weather # Positional advantage # Skill level # Individual battle experience # Individual morale # Armament (quantity and quality) = Weapons = Ancient weapons included the spear, the atlatl with light javelin or similar projectile, the bow and arrow, the sling; polearms such as the spear, falx and javelin; hand- to-hand weapons such as swords, spears, clubs, maces, axes, and knives. Catapults, siege towers, and battering rams were used during sieges. There were a wide variety and range of weapons used in the wars and battles of times long past and while it is quite easy to identify a sword or shield and know what purpose it served, even more information can be gained from knowing where said weapon comes from and what material it is made of. Ancient Greece is one of the most looked to and studied periods of time in part due to the abundance of surviving information and artifacts and this aspect can also be extended to their weaponry and armor. The Mycenaean left behind many of their weapons and armor which was found in their shaft graves, in Arms and Armour of the Greeks the swords found within the Mycenaean tombs are quite similar to rapiers being quite slender and measuring in at over three feet in length. It was due to their length and slim design that they were easily broken if struck hard enough. In addition to the rapier swords, smaller yet more durable blades were found along with a few spearheads which often came in at over two feet in length; however, the spearheads were not quite as abundant as other bladed weapons as Snodgrass states that their value and use in war and hunting was too significant to spare for graves. Prior to the Bronze Age, the Mycenaean helmets were constructed from crescent-shaped sections of wild boar tusk and arranged in horizontal bands that alternated in direction and attached to a soft material. The soldiers‚Äô shields were around four feet tall, if not more, made of ox hide and supported with some type of metal. As we move into the Bronze Age body armor began to appear as the smiths began working with this new metal, bronze helmets also began to make an appearance though the previous helmets made from boars‚Äô tusks still remained in use. It was during this period that two new types of swords made a debut, they were the horned and cruciform swords. The horned sword was dubbed as such from the horn-like appearance of their handguards and was the preferred weapon for a cutting stroke. The cruciform sword was derived and enhanced from a Minoan dagger with flanges on the hilt with rounded, right-angle handguards is how it is described within Arms and Armour. Spears continued to remain as the preferred means for a thrusting weapon, but it was during the Palace Period that they developed a socketed base. In earlier periods of Greek history, the bow and arrow was not a favored weapon for war but used primarily in hunting though in the Palace Period archery began to prosper ‚Äì the arrowheads of both time periods were made of flint, bronze, or obsidian ‚Äì while the bows of the Palace Period were made of goats‚Äô horn is how Snodgrass depicts the use of archery. From the Palace Period, we move into the Late Period of Mycenae where the weapons became shorter and more suited for use in a work environment rather than in battle and the metal-plated armor was no longer being put to use. Macedon was known more traditionally for having a strong cavalry rather than infantry and during Alexander's reign the Sarissophori came into being and this was unique Alexander's time in power. While the cavalry was more prominent the Macedon infantry, made up of the poor and peasant classes, formed into a new and unique branch of the military that was different from the hoplite. These warriors were armed with a huge pike weapon called a sarissa as well as the army being equipped with slings. The slings used almond-shaped bronze bullets that were engraved with either Philip's or his generals‚Äô name and as for siege warfare the Macedonians used an arrow-firing catapult. For armor, they were equipped with a metal helmet, greaves, and a shield covered with bronze. In The Archaeology of Weapons, a broader account of ancient weaponry is taken into account through the investigation of European weapons. Oakeshott believes that at some point between 1500‚Äì100 BC that the sword developed from the knife in both Minoan Crete and Celtic Britain and strongly resembles the rapiers. During the Bronze Age in the same general region, several other swords were developed: the Hallstatt first appeared during this Age but did not become widely used until the Iron Age, the Carps Tongues, and the Rhone Valley swords. The Hallstatt swords gained prominence during the Iron Age and were a long sword with a rather curious point that was one of three shapes: rounded, a square shape, or similar to a fishtail, and were the preferred weapon for use in a chariot. The Carps Tongues blade were also rather large swords with the edges running parallel for two-thirds of the blade before narrowing to the usually point. The last sword is that of the Rhone Valley and is generally considered more of small sword or an overly large dagger with each hilt uniquely cast in bronze. The pommel of this type of dagger has the ends drawn out into two thin points that curve in towards the blade. Along with Hallstatt swords, there were found to be spears, similar to the spearheads found in Mycenae they were quite large at fifteen inches and having a hollow socket however they were unique in that they had a small collar of bronze near where they attached to the shaft. Within India's long history there are several different regimes that produced unique weapons. The list of weapons primarily used in India are the battle axe, the bow and arrow, spears, spike, barbed dart, the sword, iron club, javelin, iron arrow, and the scimitar. One sword type is the katar blade, these are equipped with sword breaking bars and both the shape and size would depend on whether the bearer was cavalry or an infantryman. A curved sword such as the talwar or shamsheer was ideal for a cutting motion delivered from horseback. There were three early iron sword types being the leaf-shaped, spoon-shaped and the parallel sword each ideal for thrusting and jabbing as opposed to a striking or cutting motion. The Rajputs, Gurkhas, Nagas, and Coorg and Malabar each developed a weapon unique to themselves. The Rajputs wielded the khanda which is a broad and straight sword with a wider point. The Gurkhas had two swords that they preferred to use the kukri, a short sword that angled towards a wide tip, and the kora, their historical war sword which was around 60 centimeters with a single edge that was rather narrow near the handler and curving towards the front. The daos had a blade equal to two feet in length that had a wide and square-like tip and the handle was made of either wood or ivory, these were the weapons that came to popularity for the Nagas. The Ayudha katti was a single-edged blade also near two feet long but with no handle and wield by the Coorg and Malabar. In Southern India, the Borobudur and the Veragal, either shaped like a hook or a wavy design, were the swords in use. A rather unique weapon used in India is the Baghnakh which is similar to a knuckle duster and was used to slit the opponent's throat or belly. Armor in India can be found dating back to 500 BC and Vedic literature; there are several different types: leather and fabric, scale, brigandine, lamellar, mail, plate, and a combination of mail and plate. In Arms and Armour: Traditional Weapons of India it is read that the wrastrana, a breastplate, has been in use since prehistoric times though the most popular is the char-aina meaning four mirrors is a coat of mail overlaid with four elaborately designed plates. The helmets consisted of a sliding nose guard with a piece of chainmail hanging from it designed to protect the neck and shoulders. Armor was not just limited to human soldiers but extended to their horses and elephants as well. The horse armor was made up of mail and plates or lamellae which covered the neck, chest, and hindquarters underneath which was some form of padding to keep it in place while a faceplate protected the animal's face. The elephants, used as a battering ram or to break and trample enemy lines, were also donned in armor for battle. The elephant's head was covered by a steel mask and covered half of the trunk while the throat and sides were protected by lamellae armor while the tusks were tipped with sharp metal. = Sieges = The Egyptian siege of Dapur in the 13th century BC, from Ramesseum, Thebes. Siege warfare of the ancient Near East took place behind walls built of mud bricks, stone, wood or a combination of these materials depending on local availability. The earliest representations of siege warfare date to the Protodynastic Period of Egypt, c. 3000 BC, while the first siege equipment is known from Egyptian tomb reliefs of the 24th century BC showing wheeled siege ladders. Assyrian palace reliefs of the 9th to 7th centuries BC display sieges of several Near Eastern cities. Though a simple battering ram had come into use in the previous millennium, the Assyrians improved siege warfare. The most common practice of siege warfare was, however, to lay siege and wait for the surrender of the enemies inside. Due to the problem of logistics, long-lasting sieges involving anything but a minor force could seldom be maintained. Ancient siege warfare varied from each civilization and how each city was defended differently and had to approach with different tactics. One way to ensure an army used all its troops in its siege is shown when its explained how a chariot can be used in a siege, saying that, ‚ÄúDuring the sieges, the chariots, and mostly in the Neo-Assyrian armies, were surely employed to patrol and protect the flanks and the rear of the besiegers‚Äô lines and camp.‚Äù (UF 41 p. 5). This shows that generals had to find new tactics to incorporate parts of their army that wouldn‚Äôt work in the siege, as shown with the chariots on patrol duty and ensuring the army was safe from a flank attack from the enemy army. This strategy ensures that all forces are used and contributing to the battle effort and helping gain victory for them and all pulling their weight as well.  By culture  = Ancient Near East =  Mesopotamia   Egypt  Throughout most of its history, ancient Egypt was unified under one government. The main military concern for the nation was to keep enemies out. The arid plains and deserts surrounding Egypt were inhabited by nomadic tribes who occasionally tried to raid or settle in the fertile Nile river valley. The Egyptians built fortresses and outposts along the borders east and west of the Nile Delta, in the Eastern Desert, and in Nubia to the south. Small garrisons could prevent minor incursions, but if a large force was detected a message was sent for the main army corps. Most Egyptian cities lacked city walls and other defenses. The first Egyptian soldiers carried a simple armament consisting of a spear with a copper spearhead and a large wooden shield covered by leather hides. A stone mace was also carried in the Archaic period, though later this weapon was probably only in ceremonial use, and was replaced with the bronze battle axe. The spearmen were supported by archers carrying a composite bow and arrows with arrowheads made of flint or copper. No armour was used during the 3rd and early 2nd Millennium BC. As the dynasties expanded and grew upon the last that fell to gain new territory and control new people for the empire of Egypt. One of the ways the dynasties were different were the new technologies used in the later dynasties against the enemy. One example is the armies of Ramesses‚Äô II faced off against the Hittites in the Battle of Qadesh. Both armies have cavalry units supporting their infantry and scouts to get updates on the movements. These advances differ from two groups attacking head-on for control of an area and facing losses on both sides The major advance in weapons technology and warfare began around 1600 BC when the Egyptians fought and defeated the Hyksos people, who ruled Lower Egypt at the time. It was during this period the horse and chariot were introduced into Egypt. Other new technologies included the sickle sword, body armour and improved bronze casting. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptian military changed from levy troops into a firm organization of professional soldiers. Conquests of foreign territories, like Nubia, required a permanent force to be garrisoned abroad. The Egyptians were mostly used to slowly defeating a much weaker enemy, town-by-town until beaten into submission. The preferred tactic was to subdue a weaker city or kingdom one at a time resulting in the surrender of each fraction until complete domination was achieved. The encounter with other powerful Near Eastern kingdoms like Mitanni, the Hittites, and later the Assyrians and Babylonians, made it necessary for the Egyptians to conduct campaigns far from home. The next leap forwards came in the Late Period (712‚Äì332 BC), when mounted troops and weapons made of iron came into use. After the conquest by Alexander the Great, Egypt was heavily Hellenized and the main military force became the infantry phalanx. The ancient Egyptians were not great innovators in weapons technology, and most weapons technology innovation came from Western Asia and the Greek world. These soldiers were paid with a plot of land for the provision of their families. After fulfillment of their service, the veterans were allowed retirement to these estates. Generals could become quite influential at the court, but unlike other feudal states, the Egyptian military was completely controlled by the king. Foreign mercenaries were also recruited; first Nubians (Medjay), and later also Libyans and Sherdens in the New Kingdom. By the Persian period, Greek mercenaries entered service into the armies of the rebellious pharaohs. The Jewish mercenaries at Elephantine served the Persian overlords of Egypt in the 5th century BC. Although, they might also have served the Egyptian Pharaohs of the 6th century BC. As far as had been seen from the royal propaganda of the time, the king or the crown prince personally headed the Egyptian troops into battle. The army could number tens of thousands of soldiers, so the smaller battalions consisting of 250 men, led by an officer, may have been the key of command. The tactics involved a massive strike by archery followed by infantry and/or chariotry attacking the broken enemy lines. The enemies could, however, try to surprise the large Egyptian force with ambushes and by blocking the road as the Egyptian campaign records informs us. Within the Nile valley itself, ships and barges were important military elements. Ships were vital for providing supplies for the troops. The Nile river had no fords so barges had to be used for river crossings. Dominating the river often proved necessary for prosecuting sieges, like the Egyptian conquest of the Hyksos capital Avaris. Egypt had no navy to fight naval battles at sea before the Late Period. However, a battle involving ships took place at the Egyptian coast in the 12th century BC between Ramesses III and seafaring raiders.  Persia  Ancient Persia first emerged as a major military power under Cyrus the Great. Its form of warfare was based on massed infantry in light armor to pin the enemy force whilst cavalry dealt the killing blow. Cavalry was used in huge numbers but it is not known whether they were heavily armored or not. Most Greek sources claim the Persians wore no armor, but we do have an example from Herodotus which claims that an unhorsed cavalry Officer wore a gold cuirass under his red robes. Chariots were used in the early days but during the later days of the Persian Empire they were surpassed by horsemen. During the Persian Empire's height, they even possessed war elephants from North Africa and distant India. The elite of the Persian Army were the famous Persian Immortals, a 10,000 strong unit of professional soldiers armed with a spear, a sword and a bow. Archers also formed a major component of the Persian Army. Persian tactics primarily had four stages involving archers, infantry and cavalry. The archers, who wielded longbows, would fire waves of arrows before the battle, attempting to cut the enemy numbers down prior battle. The cavalry would then attempt to run into the enemy and sever communications between generals and soldiers. Infantry would then proceed to attack the disoriented soldiers, subsequently weakened from the previous attacks. = India = During the Vedic period (fl. 1500‚Äì500 BC), the Vedas and other associated texts contain references to warfare. The earliest allusions to a specific battle are those to the Battle of the Ten Kings in Mandala 7 of the Rigveda. The two great ancient epics of India, Ramayana and Mahabharata (c. 1000‚Äì500 BC) are centered on conflicts and refer to military formations, theories of warfare and esoteric weaponry. Valmiki's Ramayana describes Ayodhya's military as defensive rather than aggressive. The city, it says, was strongly fortified and was surrounded by a deep moat. Ramayana describes Ayodhya in the following words: \\"The city abounded in warriors undefeated in battle, fearless and chinskilled in the use of arms, resembling lions guarding their mountain caves\\". Mahabharata describes various military techniques, including the Chakravyuha. The world's first recorded military application of war elephants is in the Mahabharatha. From India, war elephants were brought to the Persian Empire where they were used in several campaigns. The Persian king Darius III employed about 50 Indian elephants in the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) fought against Alexander the Great. In the Battle of the Hydaspes River, the Indian king Porus, who ruled in Punjab, with his smaller army of 200 war elephants, 2,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry, presented great difficulty for Alexander the Great's larger army of 4,000 cavalry and 50,000 infantry, though Porus was eventually defeated. At this time, the Nanda Empire further east in northern and eastern India had an army of 6000 war elephants, 80,000 cavalry, 200,000 infantry and 8,000 armed chariots. Chanakya (c. 350‚Äì275 BC) was a professor of political science at Takshashila University, and later the Prime Minister of emperor Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Maurya Empire. Chanakya wrote the Arthashastra, which covered various topics on ancient Indian warfare in great detail, including various techniques and strategies relating to war. These included the earliest uses of espionage and assassinations. These techniques and strategies were employed by Chandragupta Maurya, who was a student of Chanakya, and later by Ashoka (304‚Äì232 BC). Chandragupta Maurya conquered the Magadha Empire and expanded to all of northern India, establishing the Maurya Empire, which extended from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal. In 305 BC, Chandragupta defeated Seleucus I Nicator, who ruled the Seleucid Empire and controlled most of the territories conquered by Alexander the Great. Seleucus eventually lost his territories in Southern Asia, including southern Afghanistan, to Chandragupta. Seleucus exchanged territory west of the Indus for 500 war elephants and offered his daughter to Chandragupta. In this matrimonial alliance, the enmity turned into friendship, and Seleucus' dispatched an ambassador, Megasthenes, to the Mauryan court at Pataliputra. As a result of this treaty, the Maurya Empire was recognized as a great power by the Hellenistic World, and the kings of Egypt and Syria sent their own ambassadors to his court. According to Megasthenes, Chandragupta Maurya built an army consisting of 30,000 cavalry, 9000 war elephants, and 600,000 infantry, which was the largest army known in the ancient world. Ashoka went on to expand the Maurya Empire to almost all of South Asia, along with much of Afghanistan and parts of Persia. Ashoka eventually gave up on warfare after converting to Buddhism. = China = Ancient China during the Shang Dynasty was a Bronze Age society based on chariot armies. An archaeological study of Shang sites at Anyang have revealed extensive examples of chariots and bronze weapons. The overthrow of the Shang by the Zhou saw the creation of a feudal social order, resting militarily on a class of aristocratic chariot warriors (Â£´). In the Spring and Autumn period, warfare increased. Zuo zhuan describes the wars and battles among the feudal lords during the period. Warfare continued to be stylised and ceremonial even as it grew more violent and decisive. The concept of military hegemon (Èú∏) and his \\"way of force\\" (Èú∏ÈÅì) came to dominate Chinese society. Sun Tzu created a book that still applies to today's modern armies, The Art of War. Formations of the army can be clearly seen from the Terracotta Army of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor in the history of China to be successful in the unification of different warring states. Light infantry acting as shock troops lead the army, followed by heavy infantry as the main body of the army. Wide usage of cavalry and chariots behind the heavy infantry also gave the Qin army an edge in battles against the other warring states. Warfare became more intense, ruthless and much more decisive during the Warring States period, in which great social and political change was accompanied by the end of the system of chariot warfare and the adoption of mass infantry armies. Cavalry was also introduced from the northern frontier, despite the cultural challenge it posed for robe-wearing Chinese men. Chinese river valley civilizations would adopt nomadic \\"pants\\" for their cavalry units and soldiers. = Ancient Greece = In general, most features of the hoplite panoply of classical Greek antiquity, were already known during the Late Bronze Age by Mycenaean Greeks (c. 1600‚Äì1100 BC). Mycenaean Greek society invested in the development of military infrastructure, while military production and logistics were supervised directly from the palatial centers. Infantry did almost all of the fighting in Greek battles. The Greeks did not have any notable cavalry tradition except the Thessalians.Cavalry Operations in the Ancient Greek World by Robert E. Gaebel,, 2004, p. 59, \\"... It is perhaps unlikely that by 500 cavalry played an important military role anywhere south of Thessaly, where cavalry traditionally dominated, but there can be little doubt that there were aristocratic cavalrymen on the battlefields in some ...\\" Hoplites, Greek infantry, fought with a long spear and a large shield, the hoplon also called aspis. Light infantry (psiloi) peltasts, served as skirmishers. Despite the fact that most Greek cities were well fortified (with the notable exception of Sparta) and Greek siege technology was not up to the task of breaching these fortifications by force, most land battles were pitched ones fought on flat- open ground. This was because of the limited period of service Greek soldiers could offer before they needed to return to their farms; hence, a decisive battle was needed to settle matters at hand. To draw out a city's defenders, its fields would be threatened with destruction, threatening the defenders with starvation in the winter if they did not surrender or accept battle. This pattern of warfare was broken during the Peloponnesian War, when Athens' command of the sea allowed the city to ignore the destruction of the Athenian crops by Sparta and her allies by shipping grain into the city from the Crimea. This led to a warfare style in which both sides were forced to engage in repeated raids over several years without reaching a settlement. It also made sea battle a vital part of warfare. Greek naval battles were fought between triremes ‚Äì long and speedy rowing ships which engaged the enemy by ramming and boarding actions.  Hellenistic Era  During the time of Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great, the Macedonians were regarded as the most complete well co-ordinated military force in the known world. Although they are best known for the achievements of Alexander the Great, his father Philip II of Macedon created and designed the fighting force Alexander used in his conquests. Before this time and for centuries their military prowess was nowhere near that the sarissa phalanx offered. However, prior to the improvements made by Philip II of Macedon armies fought in the traditional manner of the Greeks; that of the hoplite phalanx. Philip provided his Macedonian soldiers in the phalanx with sarissa, a spear which was 4‚Äì6 meters in length. The sarissa, when held upright by the rear ranks of the phalanx (there were usually eight ranks), helped hide maneuvers behind the phalanx from the view of the enemy. When held horizontal by the front ranks of the phalanx, enemies could be run through from far away. The hoplite type troops were not abandoned,Macedonian Warrior Alexander's elite infantryman, p. 41,,2006 but were no longer the core of the army. In 358 BC he met the Illyrians in battle with his reorganized Macedonian phalanx and utterly defeated them. The Illyrians fled in panic, leaving the majority of their 9,000-strong army dead. The Macedonian army invaded Illyria and conquered the southern Illyrian tribes. After the defeat of the Illyrians, Macedon's policy became increasingly aggressive. Paeonia was already forcefully integrated into Macedon under Philip's rule. In 357 BC Philip broke the treaty with Athens and attacked Amphipolis which promised to surrender to the Athenians in exchange for the fortified town of Pydna, a promise he didn't keep. The city fell back in the hands of Macedonia after an intense siege. Then he secured possession over the gold mines of nearby Mount Pangaeus, which would enable him to finance his future wars. In 356 the Macedonian army advanced further eastward and captured the town of Crenides (near modern Drama) which was in the hands of the Thracians, and which Philip renamed after himself to Philippi. The Macedonian eastern border with Thrace was now secured at the river Nestus (Mesta). Philip next marched against his southern enemies. In Thessaly he defeated his enemies and by 352, he was firmly in control of this region. The Macedonian army advanced as far as the pass of Thermopylae which divides Greece in two parts, but it did not attempt to take it because it was strongly guarded by a joint force of Athenians, Spartans, and Achaeans. Having secured the bordering regions of Macedon, Philip assembled a large Macedonian army and marched deep into Thrace for a long conquering campaign. By 339 after defeating the Thracians in series of battles, most of Thrace was firmly in Macedonian hands save the most eastern Greek coastal cities of Byzantium and Perinthus who successfully withstood the long and difficult sieges. But both Byzantium and Perinthus would have surely fallen had it not been for the help they received from the various Greek city-states, and the Persian king himself, who now viewed the rise of Macedonia and its eastern expansion with concern. Ironically, the Greeks invited and sided with the Persians against the Macedonians, although Persia had been the nation hated the most by Greece for more than a century. The memory of the Persian invasion of Greece some 150 years ago was still alive, but the current politics for the Macedonians had put it aside. Much greater would be the conquests of his son, Alexander the Great, who would add to the phalanx a powerful cavalry, led by his elite Companions, and flexible, innovative formations and tactics. He advanced Greek style of combat, and was able to muster large bodies of men for long periods of time for his campaigns against Persia. = Iron Age Europe =  Roman Empire  The Roman army was the world's first professional army. It had its origins in the citizen army of the Republic, which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. The reforms of Marius around 100 BC turned the army into a professional structure, still largely filled by citizens, but citizens who served continuously for 20 years before being discharged. The Romans were also noted for making use of auxiliary troops, non-Romans who served with the legions and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as light skirmish troops and heavy cavalry. Later in the Empire, these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman military. By the late Empire, tribes such as the Visigoths were bribed to serve as mercenaries. The Roman navy was traditionally considered less important, although it remained vital for the transportation of supplies and troops, also during the great purge of pirates from the Mediterranean sea by Pompey the Great in the 1st century BC. Most of Rome's battles occurred on land, especially when the Empire was at its height and all the land around the Mediterranean was controlled by Rome. But there were notable exceptions. The First Punic War, a pivotal war between Rome and Carthage in the 3rd century BC, was largely a naval conflict. And the naval Battle of Actium established the Roman empire under Augustus.  Balkans  The Illyrian king Bardyllis turned part of south Illyria into a formidable local power in the 4th century BC. He managed to become king of the DardaniansBorza, Eugene N. In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon, 1990, p. 180, . Amyntas had barely seized the throne in 394/3 when he found his kingdom under attack by a powerful Illyrian force, probably led by Bardylis, king of the Dardanii. and include other tribes under his rule. However, their power was weakened by bitter rivalries and jealousy. The army was composed by peltasts with a variety of weapons. The Thracians fought as peltasts using javelins and crescent or round wicker shields. Missile weapons were favored but close combat weaponry was carried by the Thracians as well. These close combat weapons varied from the dreaded Rhomphaia & Falx to spears and swords. Thracians shunned armor and greaves and fought as light as possible favoring mobility above all other traits and had excellent horsemen.The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC (Hardcover) by John Boardman (Editor), I. E. S. Edwards (Editor), E. Sollberger (Editor), N. G. L. Hammond (Editor),1992,, p. xvi, \\"Very different from the Phoenicians were the Scythians and the Thracians who had no interest or skill in seafaring but excelled in raiding and horsemanship\\" The Dacian tribes, located on modern-day Romania and Moldova were part of the greater Thracian family of peoples. They established a highly militarized society and, during the periods when the tribes were united under one king (82‚Äì44 BC, 86‚Äì106) posed a major threat to the Roman provinces of Lower Danube. Dacia was conquered and transformed into a Roman province in 106 after a long, hard war.  Celtic  Tribal warfare appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory. The Celts were described by classical writers such as Strabo, Livy, Pausanias, and Florus as fighting like \\"wild beasts\\", and as hordes. Dionysius said that their \\"manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in military science. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of wild boars, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all\\".Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities p. 259 Excerpts from Book XIV Such descriptions have been challenged by contemporary historians. Caesar himself describes the Gauls as forming phalanxes (likely similar to the medieval shieldwall) and testudos in battle, and using spears as their main weapon, as opposed to swords.  Germanic  Roman bronze figurine depicting a Germanic man adorned with a Suebian knot engaged in prayer. (Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris) Historical records of the Germanic tribes in Germania east of the Rhine and west of the Danube do not begin until quite late in the ancient period, so only the period after 100 BC can be examined. What is clear is that the Germanic idea of warfare was quite different from the pitched battles fought by Rome and Greece. Instead, the Germanic tribes focused on raids. The purpose of these was generally not to gain territory, but rather to capture resources and secure prestige. These raids were conducted by irregular troops, often formed along family or village lines. Leaders of unusual personal magnetism could gather more soldiers for longer periods, but there was no systematic method of gathering and training men, so the death of a charismatic leader could mean the destruction of an army. Armies also often consisted of more than 50 percent noncombatants, as displaced people would travel with large groups of soldiers, the elderly, women, and children. Though often defeated by the Romans, the Germanic tribes were remembered in Roman records as fierce combatants, whose main downfall was that they failed to unite successfully into one fighting force, under one command.Tacitus, The Annals 2.45 After the three Roman legions were ambushed and destroyed by an alliance of Germanic tribes headed by Arminius at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, the Roman Empire made no further concentrated attempts at conquering Germania beyond the Rhine. Prolonged warfare against the Romans accustomed the Germanic tribes to improved tactics such as the use of reserves, military discipline and centralised command. Germanic tribes would eventually overwhelm and conquer the ancient world, giving rise to modern Europe and medieval warfare. For an analysis of Germanic tactics versus the Roman empire see tactical problems in facing the Gauls and the Germanic tribes = Japanese = Horses and bows were very important in Japan and were used in warfare from very early times, as shown in statues and artifacts found in tombs of early chieftains. Samurai eventually became very skilled in using the horse. Because their main weapon at this time was the bow and arrow, early samurai exploits were spoken of in Japanese war tales as the ‚ÄúWay of the Horse and Bow.‚Äù Horse and bow combined was a battlefield advantage to the early samurai. A bunch of arrows made of mainly wood with poison-tipped points was worn on a warrior's right side so he could quickly knock and release an arrow mid-gallop. Although they weren't as important as the bow, swords of various sizes and types were also part of an early samurai's armory. They were mostly for close-quarters engagements. Many different kinds of spears were also used. One, the naginata, was a curved blade fixed to the end of a pole several feet long. This was known as a 'woman's spear' because samurai girls were taught to use it from an early age. A device called the kumade, which resembled a long-handled garden rake, was used to catch the clothing or helmet of enemy horsemen and unseat them. Common samurai archers had armor made of lamellae pieces laced together with colorful cords. The lightweight armor allowed for greater freedom of movement, faster speed, and reduced fatigue for horse and rider. The early Yamato period had seen a continual engagement in the Korean Peninsula until Japan finally withdrew, along with the remaining forces of the Baekje Kingdom. Several battles occurred in these periods as the Emperor's succession gained importance. By the Nara period, Honsh≈´ was completely under the control of the Yamato clan. Near the end of the Heian period, samurai became a powerful political force, thus starting the feudal period.  Notable ancient wars  * Medo-Babylonian war against Assyrian Empire * Ionian Revolt :The Ionian Revolt was a series of conflicts between the Ionia and the Persian Empire that began 499 BC and lasted until 493 BC. The revolt begins because of Athens's offensive attack to the city of Sardis and massacring the Persian citizens by burning down the city. This revolt had a major role in starting the Greco-Persian wars. * Greco-Persian Wars :The Greco-Persian Wars were a series of conflicts between the Greek City-States and the Persian Empire that began around 500 BC and lasted until 448 BC. * Peloponnesian War :The Peloponnesian War was begun in 431 BC between the Athenian Empire and the Peloponnesian League which included Sparta and Corinth. The war was documented by Thucydides, an Athenian general, in his work The History of The Peloponnesian War. The war lasted 27 years, with a brief truce in the middle. * Wars of Alexander the Great :King Alexander the III of Macedonia throughout his entire reign from 336 to 321 B.C embarked on a campaign of conquest of the Persian Empire. Starting from modern-day Western Turkey Alexander the Great conquered the entirety of Egypt, the Middle East, Iran and parts of India and Central Asia. Never losing a battle Alexander expanded the boundaries of the known world to the Greek World at the time. With an untimely death, his successors fought over the territories they had conquered. However, due to Alexander the Great Greek culture and technology spread into Asia for centuries to come. * Kalinga War (265‚Äì264 BC) was a war fought between the Mauryan Empire under Ashoka and the state of Kalinga, a feudal republic located on the coast of the present-day Indian state of Odisha. Ashoka's response to the Kalinga War is recorded in the Edicts of Ashoka. According to some of these (Rock Edict XIII and Minor Rock Edict I), the Kalinga War prompted Ashoka, already a non-engaged Buddhist, to devote the rest of his life to Ahimsa (non-violence) and to Dhamma-Vijaya (victory through Dhamma). *Qin's wars of unification :Qin's wars of unification were a series of military campaigns launched in the late 3rd century BC by the Qin state against the other six major states ‚Äì Han, Zhao, Yan, Wei, Chu and Qi ‚Äì within the territories that formed modern China. By the end of the wars in 221 BC, Qin had unified most of the states and occupied some lands south of the Yangtze River. The territories conquered by Qin served as the foundation of the Qin Empire. * Punic Wars :The Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought between Rome and the city of Carthage (a Phoenician descendant). They are known as the \\"Punic\\" Wars because Rome's name for Carthaginians was Punici (older Poeni, due to their Phoenician ancestry). They determined that the Romans would control the Mediterranean Sea and led to the eventual rise of the greater Roman Empire across Europe, Asia and Africa. # The First Punic War was primarily a naval war fought between 264 BC and 241 BC. # The Second Punic War is famous for Hannibal's crossing of the Alps and was fought between 218 BC and 202 BC. # The Third Punic War resulted in the destruction of Carthage and was fought between 149 BC and 146 BC. * Roman- Persian Wars :The Roman-Persian Wars were a series of conflicts between states of the Greco-Roman world and two successive Iranian empires: the Parthian and the Sassanid. Battles between the Parthian Empire and the Roman Republic began in 92 BC; wars began under the late Republic, and continued through the Roman and Sassanid empires. They were ended by the Arab Muslim invasions, which devastated the Sassanid and Byzantine East Roman empires shortly after the end of the last war between them. *Han‚ÄìXiongnu War :The Han‚ÄìXiongnu War,. also known as the Sino-Xiongnu War, was a series of military battles fought between the Chinese Han empire and the Xiongnu confederated state located in modern day Mongolia from 133 BC to 89 AD. The final wars resulted in the final destruction of the Xiongnu as a political entity in Siberia. China would temporally enjoy peace on its northern frontier before new peoples such as the Xianbei took the role of the Xiongnu. * Roman-Germanic Wars :The Germanic Wars is a name given to a large series of military engagements between the Romans and various Germanic tribes between 113 BC and AD 596. The nature of these wars varied through time between Roman conquest, Germanic uprisings and later Germanic invasions in the Roman Empire that started in the late 2nd century. The series of conflicts which began in the 5th century, under the Western Roman Emperor Honorius, led (along with internal strife) to the ultimate downfall of the Western Roman Empire.

The down is a distinguishing characteristic of the game compared to other codes of football, but is synonymous with a \\"tackle\\" in rugby league. The team in possession of the football has a limited number of downs (four downs in American football, three downs in Canadian football) to advance ten yards or more towards their opponent's goal line. If they fail to advance that far, possession of the ball is turned over to the other team. In most situations, if a team reaches their final down they will punt to their opponent, which forces them to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in range, they might instead attempt to score a field goal. Description A down begins with a snap or free kick (such as a kickoff or safety kick), and ends when the ball or the player in possession of it is declared down by an official, a team scores, or the ball or player in possession of it leaves the field of play. The player with possession of the ball after he has been tackled or is otherwise unable to advance the ball further on account of the play having ended is down (e.g., \\"He is down at the 34 yard line\\"). Down may also refer to the ball after it is made dead in one manner or another. The line of scrimmage for the next play will be determined by the position of the ball when it is down. Each possession begins with first down. The line to gain is marked 10 yards downfield from the start of this possession, and the situation is described as \\"1st and 10\\" (if the goal line is less than 10 yards downfield, then the goal line is the line to gain and the situation is \\"1st and goal\\"). If the offensive team moves the ball past the line to gain, they make a new first down. If they fail to do this after a specified number of downs (four in American play and three in Canadian play), the team is said to turn the ball over on downs, and possession of the ball reverts to the opposing team at the spot where the ball was downed at the end of the last down. If a penalty against the defensive team moves the ball past the line to gain, the offensive team gets a new first down. Some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic first down regardless of the distance. When the offensive team has not yet made a first down before reaching the final down, the team faces a last down situation (third down situation in Canadian play and fourth down situation in American play), where the team is forced to decide whether to either scrimmage the ball in an attempt to pick up the first down (this is called going for it [on fourth down]), or alternatively to kick the ball (either by punting or making a field goal attempt). Though statistical analysis of games suggests playing more aggressively is the better option, kicking the ball is typically seen as the safer solution; scrimmaging may lead to a turnover on downs, potentially giving the ball over to the other team with good field position. Downing the player with possession of the ball is one way to end a play (other ways include the player with the ball going out of bounds, an incomplete pass, or a score). Usually a player is made down when he is tackled by the defense. In the NFL, if the offensive player is touching the ground with some part of his body other than his hands or feet, then he is down if any defensive player touches him. In the NCAA, an offensive player touching the ground in the same manner is down, regardless of whether a defensive player touches him. If recovering the ball in one's opponent's end zone (following a kick-off in American football, and following any kick into the end zone, except for successful field goals, in Canadian football), a player may down the ball by dropping to one knee (note that in Canadian play, doing so scores a single for the opposing team). A player in possession of the ball will down the ball if he fumbles it out of bounds. If a quarterback is running with the ball during his initial possession of the same play following the snap, he may down the ball by voluntarily sliding from his feet to a sitting or recumbent position - this is to protect the quarterback from injury. In the NFL, the quarterback is the only player for whom falling down in this way automatically stops play. Terminology The situation at a down can be described succinctly in a short phrase of the form 1st/2nd/3rd/4th & X. The first part describes which down of the set of four the offense is on, and the X is a number of yards between the current line of scrimmage and the line at which the offense would gain another set of downs. Thus, offenses will normally begin on 1st & 10\\\\. If they were to gain 5 yards on the play, the subsequent situation would be described as 2nd & 5\\\\. If the distance to the target line is very small, the number of yards may be replaced by & inches (i.e. 3rd & inches). Colloquially, when the target line is far from the line of scrimmage, the term \\"& long\\" may be used (i.e. 3rd & long). When an offence has a first down within 10 yards of the goal line, the goal line becomes the line to gain as they cannot make another first down (barring a defensive penalty) without actually scoring. In these situations the number of yards is replaced with & goal, i.e. 1st & goal. Other downs-related terminology is as follows: *First down: The term \\"first down\\" can be used both as the first down in a series of downs, and for the statistical achievement of gaining the required ten yards to be awarded a new first down. When a team begins a new possessionfor example following a kickoff by their opponentstheir first play in the ensuing series of downs will be \\"first down\\". However, it would not be recorded as a first down for statistical purposes as the offense didn't do anything to achieve the first down. Statistically they are only credited with a first down if they gain the required ten yards to be awarded a new series of downs. *Down by contact: When a player with possession of the ball is made to touch the ground (other than hands or feet) by a defensive player; for example, if the ball-carrier slips and falls, he can get up and continue, but if he was pushed by a defensive player, he is said to be down by contact and the play is dead. This term is only applicable to professional football; in college and high-school football, the play ends when the player with possession goes down for any reason. An exception to this rule in effect at all levels of the game is that a player who is already kneeling when he takes possession of the ball is not considered down. This exception is primarily intended to ensure that the kneeling holder of a place kick attempt will not be considered to be down. *Turnover on downs: Transfer of possession to the other team due to failure to make a new first down on the final down. *3rd/4th & game: Informal term referring to the late-game situation where the team with the ball is losing, and failure to convert that down will seal the outcome by being either the final play before the clock runs out, or a turnover would allow the winning team to run out the clock. * Base downs: term in American football used to describe 1st and 2nd downs. The term is not applicable in Canadian football since there are only three downs. * Passing down or running down: terms used in anticipation of the type of play likely to be called. On a '3rd & long in American football, for example, a pass play is often called, whereas on a 3rd down with only a few yards to the target a running play is often deployed. In Canadian football, the strategy employed for 2nd down is broadly similar to the strategy employed for 3rd down in American football, and 1st and long situations (arising as a result of penalties) may be considered passing downs similar to how 2nd and long situations may be considered passing downs in American football. Derivation In the early 19th Century in rugby union football, the ball became dead in the field of play only by mutual consent of opponents. A player carrying the ball and held by opponents would say, \\"Held!\\", and his opponent would say, \\"Have it down.\\" That is, the ballcarrier would declare himself fairly held, unable to advance, and an opponent would call on him to put the ball down, initiating the scrimmage. In modern rugby league, this is called a tackle and each team has six tackles to score; if they fail then possession changes over to the other team. The rule was established at four tackles in 1966 and was changed to six tackles in 1972. In American football, the concept of the act of having the ball down gave rise to \\"down\\" as the condition of the player so obligated, and the ball carrier could call for a \\"down\\" voluntarily. Although NCAA rules have effectively abolished this (as the ball carrier dropping to the ground immediately ends the play), other codes for North American football, such as the NFL, still allow (as one way for the ball to become dead) for the runner to cry \\"down\\". The rule is rarely used, despite having practical advantages over the preferred method of intentional downing, the kneel.For instance, it is often advantageous to kneel at or near the goal line in the closing minute of a game when tied or down by less than three points to run out the clock, kick a last-second field goal, and prevent the opponent from scoring. Teams with proficient offenses may allow a runner to intentionally score a touchdown in order to get the ball back and have their own opportunity to score. To combat this, a runner usually attempts to kneel at or near the goal line; however, as seen in Super Bowl XLVI, this is not always successful. Had Ahmad Bradshaw called 'down' when inside the 5-yard line, he would have not had to worry about stumbling into the end zone, as he did. Bradshaw's New York Giants eventually won the game, as they were able to successfully defend against the New England Patriots in their closing drive. Eventually the rules officially applied the word to include all of the action from the time the ball was put into play (whether by snap or free kick) until it became dead. The system of downs, in terms of a set number of plays to advance the ball a certain number of yards, were originally devised by Walter Camp and introduced to the game at the college football level in 1880, when Camp was still a player of the game. Camp's original system gave teams three downs to advance the ball five yards or else lose possession of the ball, a proposal meant to reduce sandbagging. Early in the 20th century, as the forward pass was added to the game and kicking rules became more restrictive, a fourth down was added, and the requirement was doubled to 10 yards. The system of downs was introduced to Canadian football in 1903, where the Burnside rules imposed a ten yards in three downs requirement (like Walter Camp's early rules); those criteria remain in Canadian football to the present day. Two/Three-and-out Three and out is a situation in American football in which a team, after starting an offensive possession, executes three plays, fails to get a first down, and then punts. The term comes from the standard practice that an offensive unit only has three \\"real\\" plays before they are expected to punt. While, in theory, a team is allowed a fourth running or passing play, using the fourth down to run or pass is a risky move under most circumstances. If they fail to gain a new first down on a fourth-down play, the opposing team takes possession at the spot where they left off, giving them better field position than if the ball had been punted farther toward the opposing team's end zone. Typically, a team will run or pass on fourth down only if they are trailing late in a close game, are close enough to the first down marker (usually a yard or less) and in the opposing team's territory, or in a certain part of the field where a punt will likely result in a touchback (which will result in a relatively limited net gain of yardage), but just beyond the distance where a field goal is likely to be successful (in the NFL, a missed field goal results in the opposition taking possession at the spot of the unsuccessful kick) ‚Äì the range at which American football coaches will typically attempt to convert fourth downs where they otherwise would not varies between the opponent's 30- and 45-yard lines, depending on such factors as the kicker's or punter's perceived abilities and the required distance to gain. Punting following a three-and-out is unlike a turnover on downs. Punting after a three-and-out allows a team the opportunity to set their opposition farther back in field position. On a turnover on downs, there is no punt and the opposing team takes over possession of the ball at the spot of field where the final (third in the Canadian game, fourth in the American game) down ended. In Canadian football, since there are three downs, the term \\"two and out\\" is used in this situation. In the Canadian game, single points can be scored on punts and missed field goals. As a result, Canadian football coaches will never \\"go for it\\" simply on account of the ball being on the edge of field goal range ‚Äì barring extraordinary circumstances (such as trailing by between four and eight points late in the game), teams facing third and relatively long at the edge of field goal range will typically either punt (typically with the intent of putting the ball out of bounds near the opposing goal line as opposed to actually scoring a single point) or attempt a field goal.

It was developed by Cryo Interactive and published by Virgin Games. Dune blends adventure with economic and military strategy. Loosely following the story of the novel, the game casts the player as Paul Atreides, with the ultimate goal of driving the Harkonnen from Planet Dune, while managing spice extraction, military, and later, ecology through the native Fremen tribes. As the player progresses, his troops are equipped with weapons from \\"crysknives\\" to atomics, tap into Paul's latent psychic powers and get acquainted with such characters from the book as Chani and Liet-Kynes. Released for the Amiga and IBM PC compatibles, it was one of the first floppy games to be converted to CD format, which included footage of the David Lynch film, voice-acting for all speaking roles, and highly improved, 3D-rendered traveling and location screens. This version, a mix of the Amiga graphics and the extras of the PC-CD version, was also released on the Sega CD / Mega CD console. The audio track, created by St√©phane Picq and Philip Ulrich, was released by Cryo (formerly Exxos) on the album Dune: Spice Opera.  Gameplay  PC screenshot (floppy version) The story is mostly based on the plot of the Dune novel: the player is Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto Atreides and Lady Jessica. The House Atreides was given an irrefusable offer by the Emperor Shaddam IV ‚Äì mine the spice from the desert planet Arrakis, occupied by their longtime arch-enemies: the House Harkonnen. Duke Leto accepts the offer not only because of the wealth provided by Spice trading, but also to defeat the Harkonnens. The game, seen always through the eyes of Paul, is a mix between real-time strategy and an adventure game. While the basis of the game is the strategy component, dialog between characters and a linear plotline give the game more depth than most strategy games. The player is also required to do some miniquests involving talking to characters and traveling to locations, which adds a small adventure game element. There must be a balance between military and spice mining power. While having a strong military force will provide fast response to the Harkonnen, if Spice isn't mined fast enough to keep up with the Emperor's demands, the game will be lost. However, if there is too much focus on spice mining, Harkonnen troops can ambush a sietch, capturing all troops inside. They can only be rescued if the sietch is liberated. Since the game is as much resource managing as military conquest, balancing both is the key for successful completion. Dune consists of two interwoven gameplay layers: an adventure layer reminiscent of dungeon crawler games, and a top-down strategy layer more reminiscent of 4X games. The player may switch between these two layers at will, to carry out completely different sets of activities required to win the game. The adventure layer allows the player to move about short distances, whether inside structures (e.g. the Arrakeen palace, or a sietch) or to walk out into the desert. The strategy layer shows the entire planet Arrakis and allows surveying (and later controlling) Paul's assets in the Spice-mining effort and the fight against the Harkonnen. The game runs in real-time, measuring both the time of day (with corresponding changes to the in-game visuals) as well as the number of days elapsed since the beginning of the game. The flow of time is crucial and it passes at the same pace regardless of which layer is being viewed. Gameplay evolves in a manner that responds to the evolution of the story itself. As the story progresses, more and more options become available, mirroring Paul's gradual growth as a leader to the Fremen and a danger to House Harkonnen and the Emperor. The game begins with Paul at the Arrakeen palace, his family's new residence on Dune. The very early game involves moving around the palace to meet and have conversations with his family members and trusted advisors, introducing the player to the game's setting. Conversations in Dune are interactive to a limited degree, with the player able to occasionally select responses in order to advance the plot ‚Äì but most dialogue options simply command the other character to divulge pertinent strategic information, or to carry out some relevant action in the game world. For example, Duncan Idaho can be asked to give a detailed report on the current status of the Atreides Spice-mining operation, or to send a shipment of Spice to the Emperor. A few characters can be commanded to join Paul in his travels. Gurney and a Fremen inside a sietch (Sega Mega-CD) Soon enough, Paul is sent out by his father Duke Leto to contact the local Fremen tribes and attempt to convince them to work for House Atreides, which has no military or spice-mining forces of its own. Travel to those Fremen must be done by Ornithopter, by selecting the destination or a general direction and flying there in a straight line. During flight, it is possible to spot certain points of interest from the air. Certain characters who are currently following Paul may increase the probability of spotting such locations. Every visited location (or one whose position had been reported by a character during dialogue with them) is shown on the \\"select destination\\" map. The travel sequence can be skipped, but the flight time is calculated and the in-game clock will be advanced accordingly once the destination is reached. Once a Fremen sietch is reached, Paul may converse with the local chieftain to attempt to convince the Fremen to join the Atreides. Though most chieftains will agree immediately, some require further convincing and Paul would need to perform some specific action or raise his reputation score before they will agree to work for him. Once at least one tribe has been recruited, the strategy layer becomes unlocked. This layer allows Paul to direct his troops to move to any known location on the planet. It also provides a small interface to examine the availability of spice in each sector of the map (once Spice prospectors have been recruited as well). Finally, any Fremen tribe can be instructed to pick up spice-mining equipment (which increases their mining efficiency) if it is available at their current location, or even to search nearby for such equipment. Tribe movement between takes place in real-time. Tribes will automatically begin to mine Spice at their current location and will continue doing so until the Spice runs out. Spice is automatically moved to the Atreides' stores at Arrakeen, requiring no logistics for its transportation. Once Spice begins to accumulate, the Emperor will begin to make demands for Spice shipments. These are received in a communications room at the palace and must be fulfilled within a certain period of time, otherwise the game will end with the Emperor invading Dune and destroying the Atreides. This adds a dimension of gameplay wherein the player must calculate how often they must return to Arrakeen (Atreides Palace), since each shipment requires manual confirmation. Duncan can be instructed to send more or less than the requested amount of Spice (assuming it is available), in order to preserve spice or delay the next request, respectively. Spice also serves as a currency that can be used to purchase additional mining (and later military) equipment from Smuggler camps, which will be marked on the map as the game progresses. As the story develops, Paul will discover more and gather more and more Spice- mining tribes. Eventually, the Harkonnen will attack one of the and take one of the tribes prisoner, at which point Duke Leto will go on a retaliatory suicide mission and be killed. This scripted event pushes the game into the next stage: creating a military force to defend and ultimately take the fight into Harkonnen territory. To start, Paul must complete certain plot objectives by traveling to specific destinations and conversing with certain characters, primarily Stilgar. Once the requirements are fulfilled, Paul can instruct tribes to switch from Spice-mining activity to military training. Such a tribe can then be equipped with any available weaponry, instead of mining equipment, to increase its combat efficiency. Military tribes can also train to increase their prowess and morale, more-so if Gurney Halleck is told to remain at the sietch where the military forces are training. Once ready, military tribes can be sent to scout out Harkonnen fortresses and attack them. Attacking tribes must outnumber and out-equip the Harkonnen defenders of a fortress in order to win, otherwise they might be destroyed and / or taken captive. Morale also plays a strong part in a military tribe's effectiveness and Paul himself can influence a battle's outcome by traveling to the site of a battle and issuing generalized combat orders (cautious vs. aggressive). This is very risky to Paul himself and can result in him being killed in that battle. If a battle is won, Paul might be able to interrogate to fortress' previous commander for more information and possibly release any tribes held captive there. Over time, a captured fortress will be turned into a new sietch. An alternative (or complementary) option to straight-out combat is to start a terraforming project on Dune, setting certain tribes to work on ecology. This option becomes available only after completing a plot thread involving Liet-Kynes. Ecology tribes can construct a wind trap (or use an existing one) at a sietch to begin accumulating water and then be equipped with plant bulbs which they will automatically plant wherever they go. The bulbs will grow into vegetation (seen growing on both the strategy and adventure layers) and will expand northwards over time from the location where they are planted. Vegetation rapidly destroys any spice still left in the soil, in any region it expands into. As such, if it ever reaches a Harkonnen fortress, the Harkonnen will lose interest in that region and abandon it without a fight. This method is very time-consuming and will destroy any potential spice-mining prospects in the affected areas, but in conjunction with the military campaign can nevertheless pay off strategically. An important side-benefit to terraforming is that it increases the morale of all Fremen tribes, thereby increasing their efficiency at whatever they are currently doing. Early on in the scripted storyline, Paul will begin to have visions of events occurring far from his current location. As time passes and more plot events occur, Paul's telepathic ability will become more and more pronounced. At first, this ability will allow Paul to instantly know whenever a message has been received at the palace (including the all-important demands for Spice from the Emperor). Later on, Paul will be able to contact and command Fremen tribes a short distance from his position on the map. As the game progresses, the range of Paul's telepathic ability will increase, until it eventually spans the entire planet. Furthermore, the Fremen will eventually teach Paul to ride sandworms (as an alternative to Ornithopter flight), which can be used to approach Harkonnen fortresses more safely. The ultimate goal of the game is to destroy all or most of the Harkonnen fortresses, coming within striking distance of the Harkonnen palace, Carthag, which is near the north pole of Dune. Then, a massive army must be collected in order to make the final assault and win the game.  Development  = Groundwork = Martin Alper, the founder of Mastertronic (later renamed Virgin Interactive), was fascinated by the novel Dune and had been trying to buy the interactive adaptation rights since 1988. \\"B√¢tisseurs de r√™ves : Enqu√™te sur le nouvel eldorado des jeux vid√©o\\" by Daniel Ichbiah, First, 5 February 1997, 430 pages, section \\"Dune ‚Äì Travers√©e du d√©sert\\" . \\"Micro Kid's ‚Äì Dune\\" interview of Philippe Ulrich, Tilt n¬∞94, October 1991, page 41. He conducted a study to measure the viability of such an adaptation, estimating that there were between 3 and 4 million fans of the novel in the United States. He found that Dino De Laurentiis, the producer of David Lynch's film Dune, held the adaptation rights. Dune by Jean-Baptiste Lebelle, Grospixels. Following the release of the film, the production company had gone bankrupt. After the death of Frank Herbert, there were several legal trials to determine who then owned the rights. Martin Alper was finally able to buy the rights from Universal Pictures in the spring of 1990. The first links between the future French company Cryo Interactive, born out of the ashes of ERE Informatique and Virgin Interactive were forged when Philippe Ulrich met Jean-Martial Lefranc, recently appointed director of Virgin Loisirs by Patrick Zelnik. Lefranc was an admirer of Ulrich's team, especially for its recent release of Captain Blood, for which Ulrich was scenario designer. On 20 July 1990, he organized a meeting between Frank Herman, head of the group in London and Ulrich's team. Herman promised them a meeting with Martin Alper, president of Virgin Games USA. R√©mi Herbulot met with Martin Alper in Los Angeles to pitch three video games, all with strong science fiction elements. In response, Alper proposed to Herbulot the idea of adapting the Dune novel to a video game format, as he held those rights. The rights agreement between the groups was finalized in August 1990, during a dinner at Fouquet's, in the presence of Philippe Ulrich and Frank Herman. = Pre-production = A team of developers, mostly Frank Herbert fans, began to work on the project. The team worked for 6 months on paper and organized weekly meetings. Ulrich met the game's producer, David Bishop, of whom he had heard conflicting reports in the past. Bishop expressed his desire to design the game himself. In the first few months of development, the documents that the developers sent to the United States did not convince Virgin. Communication was relayed through Bishop in London, who did not defend the project. The Americans at Virgin Games criticized the game for its \\"French aesthetic\\" and too-prominent user interface. They also were not convinced that the proposed mixture of adventure and strategy gameplay elements would succeed. To give the development team a more defined framework, Philippe Ulrich created a new label within Virgin Interactive: Cryo Entertainment. = Trouble = On 19 September 1990, after a change in management, Virgin threatened to cancel the production. No contract had yet been signed; the developers feared all their work would be lost. Frank Herman managed to salvage the project, but the American backers, including Martin Alper, pulled out. Alper entrusted the electronic adaptation rights of Dune to an American studio, Westwood Studios, at a meeting in Las Vegas. The developers, working on the game practically in secret, ended up with a design document more than 100 pages long. The game was inspired by the novel by Frank Herbert, but also by David Lynch's film. Feyd-Rautha, for example, retained the likeness of Sting, but the majority of the characters were completely redesigned by Jean-Jacques Chaubin. Also adapted from the film is the \\"weirding module\\", a weapon that does not exist in the novel. The graphics were created for VGA 256 color mode. \\"Micro Kid's ‚Äì Dune\\" by Jean-Loup Jovanovic, Tilt n¬∞94, October 1991, pages 38‚Äì40. In early 1991, the Gulf War seemed to echo the themes of Dune and Ulrich was inspired to integrate images recalling the night bombing of Baghdad into the game. In April 1991, Sega bought Virgin's European operations and Cryo lost Jean-Martial Lefranc, its intermediary with the publisher's general management. Their new manager, Christian Brecheteau, discovered that Virgin Entertainment had financed Cryo in secret, but fortunately expressed interest in the project. An audit of the accounts of Sega France, which absorbed Virgin Loisirs, was carried out. Management now realized that the development of Dune in France was still being funded, while Sega had not obtained the Dune license. Members of the Cryo team rushed to London to meet with Martin Alper to present their work samples and hopefully save the project. Alper and Bishop were excited by the early prototypes and they reversed their cancellation decision, despite still having another Dune project under development. They gave Cryo five weeks to present a prototype able to satisfy the American public. The plot was modified from the novel and the developers chose to start the game with the arrival of Paul on Arrakis. A few weeks later, they sent a prototype to the United States. Alper was impressed not only by the game but also by the soundtrack, which he wanted to release on CD. In September 1991, he signed the game Dune and a second game, KGB, which Ulrich had proposed to him at the European Computer Trade Show in London in 1990. In October 1991, the game was in pre-beta, with a demo version planned. On 27 September 1991, Virgin Games USA signed an agreement with Sega for an adaptation of Dune for Mega-CD. = Aftermath = In January 1992, after this comeback, Ulrich, Herbulot and Lefranc spun off Cryo Interactive as an independent company. Cryo's Dune arrived in stores before Westwood's game, which was eventually renamed Dune II. The development of Dune cost 3 million francs, of which 800,000 was used by Cryo. With the signing of the distribution contract, Cryo was granted a budget of 600,000 francs. Cryo planned a number of ports, to Atari ST, Amiga, CD32, Super Nintendo and possibly NES and Master System. Most never saw the light of day. Philippe Ulrich also planned a sequel to the game, which this time would place the player on the side of the Harkonnens. Dune was one of the first floppy disk games to be ported to the new CD format. This was thanks to Ulrich's willingness to exploit this new medium, despite initial opposition from David Bishop.\\"Nous allons pouvoir inventer des univers.

The Sega Mega-CD version had graphics close to the Amiga version's, but offered the extras of the DOS CD-ROM version: snippets from Lynch's film, voice acting and new travelling animations. Mega placed the game at No. 10 in their Top Mega CD Games of All Time.Mega magazine issue 26, page 74, Maverick Magazines, November 1994  Packaging  Dune was the first video game to make use of the game cover printed on a sleeve and then slipped over a pre-printed, Virgin Games-branded contents box. Before this game was released the industry printed expensive individual boxes for each and every game or they printed wraps that were glued to a box but that took extra processing time. This sleeve-box combo became the industry standard for video game boxes for the next two decades. The new sleeve-styled box was created by Anthony Mesaros for the US office of Virgin Games. He had created the sleeve design because he wanted to be able to get flashy covers printed in several colors as well as foil and yet create a box that cost significantly less that printing the individual game covers on individual boxes. His new packaging design not only came in at a much lower cost but had required less than half the turnaround time for actual printing.  Audio  Sound track Dune: Spice Opera was released by Virgin Records in 1992. The tracks were composed by St√©phane Picq and Philippe Ulrich. Virgin Records was later sold to EMI, which then became the new holders of the copyright. Picq wished to have the rights in order to rerelease the album, though they were not granted.St√©phane Picq website ~ News  Reception  Dune was commercially successful, with sales of 20,000 units in its first week alone. By 1997, it had sold 300,000 units. Cryo Interactive's Philippe Ulrich later noted that the company had \\"bet a lot on the explosion of the PC and the CD-ROM\\" with Dune, and that the game's hit status was heavily responsible for Cryo's quick growth. Computer Gaming World stated in September 1992 that the developer \\"had succeeded in distilling the book's complex plot into a game that involves the player in the outcome\\". It praised the graphics and animation, and concluded that the game was \\"a light and interesting challenge\\" easy enough for most players to finish. In April 1994 the magazine said of the CD version that \\"many of the actors come off better on the PC screen than they fared in the real cinema, and the addition of digitized speech spices up many of the dull parts of the game\\". QuestBusters stated \\"I really enjoyed this game, a high quality product with many surprisingly entertaining aspects.\\" Because of the strategic aspects it recommended the game to those who enjoyed both strategy games and graphic adventures. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Sega CD version an 8 out of 10, describing it as \\"involving\\", and praising the digitized graphics and flight sequences.  Later games  In 1992 software company Westwood Studios produced a rival Dune game also for Virgin Interactive, Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty. Westwood later produced two sequels, Dune 2000 in 1998 and Emperor: Battle for Dune in 2001. Cryo returned to the Dune universe in 2001 with Frank Herbert's Dune, the financial failure of which bankrupted Cryo Interactive, causing the nearly finished Dune Generations to never be released.

The population numbers approximately 54,000, which makes it the ninth-largest city in Slovakia. It is the center of the Turiec region and the District of Martin. History From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The first recorded reference to Martin in written sources is dated to 1284 under the name of Vila Sancti Martini. In the turbulent 15th century, Martin suffered from many disasters, for example from the attack of the Hussites in 1433, when the town was burned down. Just ten years later, it was destroyed again by an earthquake and Martin started to be slowly degraded from royal to the privileged town and under direct influence of the R√©vay family. Since the 18th century, Martin became centre of the Tur√≥c county. The town became the foremost Slovak cultural center in the 19th century. Several cultural institutions (including Slovak Matica and Slovak National Museum) were founded there. Most political activities leading to the Slovak national emancipation in the 19th and early 20th centuries were organized in or from Martin. The town was also industrialized at this time. The first printing works were established in 1869, the furniture factory Tatra n√°bytok in 1890, and so on. The town lost some of its importance after Pressburg (today's Bratislava) became the capital of Slovakia in 1919. Today, it is the seat of the Slovak National Library and Slovak Matica. National Council of the Slovak Republic declared the city of Martin the center of national culture of the Slovaks on August 24, 1994. The city of Martin won the United Nations Public Service Award in 2011 in the  Preventing and Combating Corruption in the Public Service. Geography Martin lies at an altitude of above sea level and covers an area of . It is located in northern Slovakia, in the Turiec Basin, just south of the confluence of the Turiec river with V√°h. Mountain ranges in the proximity of the city are Mal√° Fatra (Lesser Fatra) and Vel‚Äôk√° Fatra (Greater Fatra); more to the south are the ≈Ωiar and Kremnica Mountains. The nearest major cities are ≈Ωilina, away to the north-west, Bansk√° Bystrica, away to the south-east and capital Bratislava, to the south-west (by road). Martin has 10 boroughs: Jahodn√≠ky, ƒΩadove≈à, Stred, Sever, Ko≈°√∫ty, Podh√°j, Str√°ne, Priekopa, Tomƒçany and Z√°turƒçie. =Climate= Martin lies in the north temperate zone and has a continental climate with four distinct seasons. It is characterized by a significant variation between hot summers and cold, snowy winters. Average annual temperature is around and average annual rainfall is ; most of the rainfall is in June and in the first half of July. Snow cover lasts from 60 to 80 days per year. Demographics Martin has a population of 55,000 (as of December 31, 2016). Since end of 1990s when the population reached the top (more than 60,000) every year a slight decrease has been observed. According to the 2001 census, 94.9% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.6% Czechs, 0.5% Romani, and 0.2% Hungarians. The religious makeup was 44.1% Roman Catholics, 31.2% people with no religious affiliation, and 17.2% Lutherans. According to the 2011 census, 81.7% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.0% Czechs, 0.09% Roma, and 0.2% Hungarians and 16.2% did not specify nationality. The religious makeup was 34.3% Roman Catholics, 28.3% people with no religious affiliation, 21.1% did not specify religion and 13.2% Lutherans. Sights Martin (east view) and Greater Fatra. The tallest waterfall (38 m) in Lesser Fatra near Martin City centre of Martin. The oldest building is a Romanesque church dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours (13th century). The Slovak National Museum placed its ethnographic collection in Martin. An open-air museum in the suburbs, the Museum of the Slovak Village (Jahodn√≠cke h√°je), exhibits the traditional rural architecture and folk traditions of the region of Turiec. The Slovak National Cemetery is the official Slovak hall of fame, inspired by the Panth√©on in Paris. The Slovak Chamber Theatre in Martin was established in 1944 as the second professional theatre company in Slovakia. The theatre building is a landmark of the city center. Martin is surrounded by Mal√° Fatra and Veƒæk√° Fatra mountains, which in winter offer excellent conditions for skiing. There is a historic mansion in the town of Z√°turƒçie in Martin district. Economy Martin is home to a Volkswagen Group-owned automotive industry production plant, under the Volkswagen Slovakia, a.s. subsidiary. Opened in 2000, it employs approximately 800 people. The city was hit hard in 2008 by the recession, as Volkswagen was forced to lay off over 200 workers. Other major industrial companies include ≈ΩOS Vr√∫tky (rail vehicles industry) or Prefa Suƒçany (concrete prefabricates). The Danish shoe company ECCO is located near the Kosuty II borough in an industrial park. This park also hosts other companies such as MAR SK, GGB or Zinkpower. The university hospital employs approximately two thousand persons: doctors, nurses and other staff. The printing company Neografia has clients in more than 15 European countries, where Neografia exports the decisive part of its production of books. Due to the economic crisis the unemployment rate rose to 10%, but was still below the national average rate. In March 2018, the unemployment rate was under 4%. Many inhabitants work in nearby town ≈Ωilina, that is an important industrial center and major city of region. Education Martin is home to the Jessenius Faculty of Medicine, which is one of three medical schools in Slovakia. Among its international students are up to 500 Norwegian and 100 Icelandic medical students. The city's system of primary education consists of nine public schools, two private primary schools (BellAmos School), and two religious primary schools, enrolling in total 5,027 pupils. There is a plan to build a five-story high school near the main square. When completed, it will be the largest educational building in Slovakia apart from universities. The school will be named after Andrej Hlinka, a former Slovak politician. Secondary education is represented by two gymnasia with 828 students, three specialized high schools with 1,050 students (Business Academy Martin), and three vocational schools with 2,501 students (data ). Sport The division, the Handball 1st league. Transport Martin lies on the crossroad that interconnect the main road (as well main railway) from Bratislava to Ko≈°ice with Bansk√° Bystrica.

It has a visitors' centre that attracts around 300,000 visitors a year.  History  Driveway approaching visitor centre Vines at Denbies, looking towards Ranmore Common (taken in autumn). Denbies house would have been visible on the brow of the hill. The estate takes its name from John Denby, who owned the farmhouse in the 16th century. In the mid-18th century Denby's farm buildings were converted into a gentleman's residence by Jonathan Tyers, proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens near London. Tyer's garden at Denbies was in startling contrast to the frivolities of Vauxhall, being adorned with memento mori (\\"reminders of death\\"). The property passed through other hands, and in the 1850s it was rebuilt, much greater, by pre-eminent early Victorian master builder, Thomas Cubitt. He was visited at Denbies by Prince Albert, who planted a commemorative tree which survived until the Great Storm of 1990. The house remained in that family except in World War II when it was requisitioned by the military. In the 1950s Cubitt's great-grandson decided to demolish the house as he lacked the funds to restore and maintain it. He converted the laundry and gardener's house into a smaller Regency-style house. The heartland of the estate, earlier parcels having been sold, was purchased by Biwater in the 1980s with development later by local businessman Adrian White.  Wine production  Vineyard, July 2009 Denbies is situated on the North Downs, which are a range of chalk hills the topsoil of which consists of fertile loam interspersed with flints. From 1986 to 1989 White had the south-facing slopes planted with vines, which cover of the estate, the remainder of which is woodland and pasture. The average yield is 300,000 litres of wine per year. Around 65 per cent of Denbies' wine is sold at the visitors' centre, and the remainder through supermarkets, wholesalers and via mail order. In 2010 Denbies Chalk Ridge Ros√© won the IWC international Gold award, beating more than 360 competitors from 21 countries.

Situated on the bank of the Jerte River, Plasencia has a historic quarter that is a consequence of the city's strategic location along the Silver Route, or Ruta de la Plata. Since the 15th century, the noblemen of the region began to move to Plasencia, defining its current appearance. History =Antiquity and the Middle Ages= Although Plasencia was not founded until 1186, pieces of pottery found in Boquique‚Äôs Cave provide evidence that this territory was inhabited long before. Pascual Madoz's dictionary details that this ancient territory, either called Ambroz or Ambracia, was originally given the name Ambrosia before becoming Plasencia. Facsimile of the 1186 city charter In the same year that the city was founded, Alfonso VIII of Castile gave the city its independence and the Diocese of Plasencia was created. The original motto of the city, ', means to please God and man. Ten years after its birth, Plasencia was taken over by the Almohad Caliphate, a Moroccan Berber-Muslim dynasty that dominated the Iberian peninsula throughout much of the 12th century. King Alfonso VIII and his forces recaptured the city within the same day. At the end of the 13th century, the Charter of Plasencia was created, allowing the Christian, Muslim and Jewish people to live peacefully together within the city. This charter prompted the formation of a Jewish community in Plasencia, which became the largest Jewish community in Extremadura at that time and held a considerable amount of economic power. The regimiento system of local government was established in the city by Alfonso XI of Castile on 11 January 1346. The 15th century was a vital period in Plasencia‚Äôs history, because it was at this time that a jurisdiction of lordship was established. In 1442, King John II of Castile gifted the city to the House of Z√∫√±iga and its right to vote in the Cortes of Castile was lost. In 1446, the first university in Extremadura was installed in Plasencia, according to the wish of the Bishop. As a result, everyone from the surrounding areas who could afford to study in the university moved to Plasencia. The bull of Plasencia in the Cantigas de Santa Maria. In the second half of the 15th century, Plasencia got caught up in some warlike affairs. Henry IV of Castile was deposed from the throne in favour of the infant Alfonso after the count of Plasencia stole the sword of this king‚Äôs wooden statue, signifying that without the sword, he had no power. Later in the 15th century Joanna la Beltraneja and Afonso V of Portugal were married, making the former queen consort of Portugal, also becoming a claimant to the Crown of Castile. In 1488, the duke died and his grandson, √Åvaro de Zu√±iga y Perez de Guzm√°n, succeeded him. The nobility took advantage of this situation and rebelled against the House of Z√∫√±iga, trying to recover the power that they had over Plasencia before it was gifted away. The Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, stood by them and made the revolt a success. Ferdinand swore to defend and protect the freedom and charters of Plasencia until his death. =Modern age= Plasencia in the 16th century. Plasencia had a certain importance in the American conquest too. Doctors recommended this place to King Ferdinand as the healthiest place in his kingdom and the place where he should establish his residence. The monarch moved here in 1515, and died in Madrigalejo during his travel to Guadalupe. In 1573, the Bishop of Plasencia, Pedro Ponce de Le√≥n, donated a significant part of his own library to the monastery of El Escorial, and a decade later, another bishop had a library formed, containing more than 3,880 works in more than 10,000 volumes. When the original 18 provinces of Castile arose in 1502, they were established according to their votes in the Cortes. There were no cities in Extremadura with the right of vote, because most of them were property of Salamanca. Due to this, the inhabitants of Plasencia decided to buy the right which they previously held, and asked other important cities such as Alc√°ntara, Badajoz, C√°ceres, M√©rida and Trujillo to help them. This was the moment in which the province of Extremadura was formed. =Contemporary Age= During the Peninsular War, Plasencia became a strategic location for French troops. In June 1808, uprisings occurred which later were ended through murder and lynching of French. Some time later, the inhabitants of Plasencia established a local military junta to defend their own interests; however, the city was overtaken and villages, such as Malpartida, were burnt down. French soldiers took control of Plasencia 12 times by forcible means and apart from the high number of buildings that were destroyed, the inhabitants too were also tortured and killed. Once the Old Regime was abolished, Extremadura was divided into two different provinces: C√°ceres and Badajoz. Plasencia argued with C√°ceres about which of them should be the capital of the province, arguing that it had a higher number of population, it was more affluent and it had the bishop's palace. Despite these advantages, other traits were considered more important and C√°ceres was chosen as the capital of the province. The Restoration was a revolutionary era for Plasencia because the city witnessed many reforms that affected its economy and society. For the first time the city had a drinking water network, public lighting, and an improved sewer system. Furthermore, the agrarian economy evolved into an industrial one thanks to the railway station which was founded in the city. A curiosity of this period, the painter Joaqu√≠n Sorolla immortalized the city in his painting ' in 1917, in which you can see the landscape of the city from the river Jerte. During the Spanish Civil War, the military uprising of 1936 led by Francisco Franco rapidly swept Plasencia. The Lieutenant Colonel Jos√© Puente took control of the city easily, and as a result, the Republican prisoners were forced to build one of the city‚Äôs most famous parks, The Pines Park. The final chapter of the 20th century was an extraordinary period for Plasencia and its development; the number of inhabitants has tripled in the last 60 years, and during this period of time many public works have been constructed including the hospital Virgen del Pueto, the reservoir of Plasencia, the Municipal Sport Centre and many useful roads. In addition, several university degrees are offered at the present university campus. File:Sorolla-5.jpgThe market, oil painting by Joaqu√≠n Sorolla showing an image of the city in 1917.

In 1189, by request of Alfonso VIII, Plasencia was declared head of dioceses by Pope Clement III and work on a Romanesque Cathedral started shortly after, concluding sometime in the 18th century, by which time fashions had changed and Gothic elements had been added in the forms of pointed arches to the Nave and a rose window to the main South Entrance, while the cloister, on the East side bordering the city walls, was entirely Gothic. In the 15th century the Dioceses decided to build a grand Gothic Cathedral in the same site, demolishing the old cathedral as the new one was being built. Work started in 1498 and by the 16th century, standard Renaissance elements had been added such as the East Entrance and the elaborate Choir Seating, while the local style of the period, Plateresque, is present in the West (main) and the Presbytery Entrances. Work continued until the 18th century, when, with only the Sanctuary and the Transept of the New Cathedral finished, the project was abandoned leaving behind a somewhat odd result, as most of the Nave of the Old Cathedral, its cloister and its unique Octagonal Tower housing the ' Chapel is still attached to the New Cathedral, while the new choir, that was supposed to stand along the New Nave, was positioned across the transept.

It is a quasar that appears as two images, a result from gravitational lensing caused by the galaxy YGKOW G1 that is located in the line of sight between Earth and the quasar. Quasar QSO 0957+561 A (SBS 0957+561 A) and QSO 0957+561 B (SBS 0957+561 B) are the two components of a double-imaged quasar, meaning that an intervening mass concentration between Earth and the quasar bends light so that two images of the quasar appear in the sky. This is known as gravitational lensing, and is a consequence of Einsteinian warped space-time. The quasar lies at redshift z = 1.41 (8.7 billion ly), while the lensing galaxy lies at redshift z = 0.355 (3.7 billion ly). The lensing galaxy with apparent dimension of 0.42√ó0.22 arcminutes lies almost in line with the B image, lying 1 arcsecond off. The quasar lies 10 arcminutes north of NGC 3079, in the constellation Ursa Major. The astronomical data services SIMBAD and NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) list several other names for this system. The Twin Quasar's two images are separated by 6 arcseconds. Both images have an apparent magnitude of 17, with the A component having 16.7 and the B component having 16.5. There is a 417 ¬± 3-day time lag between the two images. Lens The lensing galaxy, YGKOW G1Nomenclature of Celestial Objects (Result I) (sometimes called G1 or Q0957+561 G1), is a giant elliptical (type cD) lying within a cluster of galaxies that also contribute to the lensing. History The quasars QSO 0957+561A/B were discovered in early 1979 by an Anglo-American team around Dennis Walsh, Robert Carswell and Ray Weyman, with the aid of the 2.1 m Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, United States. The team noticed that the two quasars were unusually close to each other, and that their redshift and visible light spectrum were surprisingly similar. They published their suggestion of \\"the possibility that they are two images of the same object formed by a gravitational lens\\".Nature 279, S.381‚Äì384: 0957 + 561 A, B: twin quasistellar objects or gravitational lens? D.Walsh, R.F.Carswell, R.J.Weymann 31 May 1979 The Twin Quasar was one of the first directly observable effects of gravitational lensing, which was described in 1936 by Albert Einstein as a consequence of his 1916 General Theory of Relativity, though in that 1936 paper he also predicted \\"Of course, there is no hope of observing this phenomenon directly.\\" Critics however identified a difference in appearance between the two quasars in radio frequency images. In mid 1979 a team led by David Roberts at the VLA (Very Large Array) near Socorro, New Mexico/USA discovered a relativistic jet emerging from quasar A with no corresponding equivalent in quasar B. Furthermore, the distance between the two images, 6 arcseconds, was too great to have been produced by the gravitational effect of the galaxy G1, a galaxy identified near quasar B. Young et al. discovered that galaxy G1 is part of a galaxy cluster which increases the gravitational deflection and can explain the observed distance between the images. Finally, a team led by Marc V. Gorenstein observed essentially identical relativistic jets on very small scales from both A and B in 1983 using VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry). Subsequent, more detailed VLBI observations demonstrated the expected (parity reversed) magnification of the image B jet with respect to image A jet. The difference between the large-scale radio images is attributed to the special geometry needed for gravitational lensing, which is satisfied by the quasar but not by all of the extended jet emission seen by the VLA near image A. Slight spectral differences between quasar A and quasar B can be explained by different densities of the intergalactic medium in the light paths, resulting in differing extinction.\\"Quasare im Doppelpack\\" aus \\"Astro-Lexikon\\" Andreas M√ºller August 2007 30 years of observation made it clear that image A of the quasar reaches earth about 14 months earlier than the corresponding image B, resulting in a difference of path length of 1.1 ly. In 1996, a team at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics led by Rudy E. Schild discovered an anomalous fluctuation in one image's lightcurve, which led to a controversial and unconfirmable theory that there is a planet approximately three Earth masses in size in the lensing galaxy. The results remain speculative because the chance alignment that led to its discovery will never happen again. If it could be confirmed, however, it would make it the most distant known planet, 4 billion ly away.New Scientist (issue 2037), Do alien worlds throng faraway galaxy? Govert Schilling 6 July 1996 In 2006, R. E. Schild suggested that the accreting object at the heart of Q0957+561 is not a supermassive black hole, as is generally believed for all quasars, but a magnetospheric eternally collapsing object. Schild's team at the Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics asserted that \\"this quasar appears to be dynamically dominated by a magnetic field internally anchored to its central, rotating supermassive compact object\\" (R. E. Schild).

M., Smith (1969). The British Amphibians and Reptiles. Collins, London, UK.It does not occur in the Iberian peninsula or European Turkey. Its distribution is often patchy. Description The sand lizard is a sexually dimorphic legged lizard. In northwest Europe, both sexes are characterised by lateral and dorsal strips of ocellated (eye-shaped) markings, dark patches with pale centres. Colouration varies across their European and Russian range. Males have finer markings than females, and their flanks turn bright green during the spring mating season, fading again in the late summer. Male adults may reach a total body length of 19.3 cm, where female adults may reach 18.5 cm.\\"Sand Lizard (Lacerta agilis)\\". It has several subspecies, the westernmost of which is L. a. agilis. In this and the other main western subspecies (L. a. argus), the dorsal stripe is thin and interrupted, or not present at all. This applies particularly to the latter subspecies, which also includes a plain red or brown-backed phase without any dorsal markings. In these two subspecies, only the flanks of the males turn green in the mating season, but in the eastern subspecies (predominantly L. a. exigua), males can be wholly green, even outside the breeding season. Most of these lizards live in Eastern Europe. They are mostly common in Poland, Czech Republic, and countries around that area. They bask on rocks in the day and at night they go into their holes under ground. To protect themselves, they pop off their tails and bite the predators. Habitat In the UK, the sand lizard is largely restricted to lowland heathlands and sand dunes in Southern England, and to the coastal sand dunes of Northwest England and Wales. It also occupies a range of man-made habitats within these areas, including railway lines, roadsides, brownfield sites and field boundaries. Conservation status It is regarded as threatened and is strictly protected under UK law - as it is throughout most of Europe (it is a European Protected Species). This is in contrast to L. a. exigua, whose Russian name translates as the \\"common lizard\\". The UK Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust coordinates conservation action for the sand lizard, including a successful captive- breeding and reintroduction programme. Sand Lizard is facing multiple threats including habitat destruction, habitat degradation, habitat fragmentation, lack of habitat management, inappropriate habitat management right now. Although UK has making the protection of sand lizard as a law, there are still actions needed to be taken, including habitat protection, habitat management, species protection, species management, distribution surveys, population and conservation status monitoring, scientific research, and public awareness.Russell, Liam (December 2012). \\"THE CONSERVATION AND LANDSCAPE GENETICS OF THE SAND LIZARD Lacerta agilis\\" Reproduction Generally, males reaches sexual maturity at a smaller size compared with females. Vitellogenesis happens when females are 45 days for the whole population. Both sexes tend to lose body fat during mating period, since their main energy resources come from body fat and from the liver and proximal at the tail. Strasbourg (26 October 2006). \\"Action Plan for the Conservation of the Sand Lizard (Lacerta agilis) in Northwest Europe\\" After a few weeks from the hibernation, male adults become extremely aggressive towards each other, trying to mate as many as females as they can.Corbett, K.F. and D.L. Tamarind. 1979. Conservation of the sand lizard, Lacerta agilis, by habitat management. Brit. J. Herp. 5: 799-823. The female sand lizard lays eggs in loose sand in a sunny location, leaving them to be incubated by the warmth of the ground.Olsson, Mats (1988-01-01). \\"Ecology of a Swedish population of the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) - a preliminary report\\". Mertensiella. 1: 86‚Äì91.  Predators and Competitors  Sand Lizards are preyed by a large range of predators such as mustelids, foxes, badgers, birds, and snakes. Besides of wild predators, domestic species, such as pheasants, chickens, and cats. Inbreeding avoidance When a female sand lizard mates with two or more males, sperm competition within the female's reproductive tract may occur. Active selection of sperm by females appears to occur in a manner that enhances female fitness. On the basis of this selective process, the sperm of males that are more distantly related to the female are preferentially used for fertilization, rather than the sperm of close relatives. This preference may enhance the fitness of progeny by reducing inbreeding depression.

UCL Business PLC was created in August 2006 through the merger of UCL BioMedica with UCL's internal knowledge transfer department, also known as UCL Business. The former UCL Business had been established to provide a link between UCL's academics and industry, and to aid the development of commercially valuable technologies arising from UCL, whilst UCL BioMedica had been established to commercialise opportunities arising from UCL's biomedical research strengths, as well as to conduct clinical trials. The integration of the two technology transfer activities created a single organisation focused on delivering the complete commercialisation process from patent registration and support for the creation of new businesses, through to licensing and sales of technologies to industry partners. UCLB provided advice and a grant support to Siavash Haroun Mahdavi in helping him to establish the robotics company Complex Matters.

In a physical interpretation context, FCD provides a Langragian description of the vehicle movements whereas stationary devices provide an Eulerian description. The participating vehicle acts itself consequently as a moving sensor using an onboard GPS receiver or cellular phone. The most common and widespread use of FCD is to determine the traffic speed on the road network. Based on these data, traffic congestion can be identified, travel times can be calculated, and traffic reports can be rapidly generated. In contrast to stationary devices such as traffic cameras, number plate recognition systems, and induction loops embedded in the roadway, no additional hardware on the road network is necessary. Floating cellular data Floating cellular data is one of the methods to collect floating car data. This method uses cellular network data (CDMA, GSM, UMTS, GPRS). No special devices/hardware are necessary: every switched-on mobile phone becomes a traffic probe and is as such an anonymous source of information. The location of the mobile phone is determined using (1) triangulation or (2) the hand-over data stored by the network operator. As GSM localisation is less accurate than GPS based systems, many phones must be tracked and complex algorithms used to extract high-quality data. For example, care must be taken not to misinterpret cellular phones on a high speed railway track near the road as incredibly fast journeys along the road. However, the more congestion, the more cars, the more phones and thus more probes. In metropolitan areas where traffic data are most needed the distance between cell sites is lower and thus precision increases. Advantages over GPS-based or conventional methods such as cameras or street embedded sensors include: No infrastructure or hardware in cars or along the road. It is much less expensive, offers more coverage of more streets, it is faster to set up (no work zones) and needs less maintenance. In 2007, GDOT demonstrated in Atlanta that such system can emulate very well road sensors data for section speeds. A 2007 study by GMU investigated the relationship between vehicle free flow speed and geometric variables on urban street segments using FCDAli, A. T., Flannery, A., & Venigalla, M. M. (2007). Prediction models for free flow speed on urban streets. Transportation Research Board 86th Annual Meeting. Washington D.C. 2007. (No. 07-1954). . Vehicle re-identification RFID E-ZPass reader attached to the pole and its antenna (right) used in traffic monitoring in New York City by using vehicle re-identification method Vehicle re-identification methods require sets of detectors mounted along the road. In this technique, a unique serial number for a device in the vehicle is detected at one location and then detected again (re-identified) further down the road. Travel times and speed are calculated by comparing the time at which a specific device is detected by pairs of sensors. This can be done using the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses from Bluetooth devices,Tarnoff, Philip John, Bullock, Darcy M, Young, Stanley E, et al. Continuing Evolution of Travel Time Data Information Collection and Processing,Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2009 Paper #09-2030 TRB 88th Annual Meeting Compendium of Papers DVD or using the radio-frequency identification (RFID) serial numbers from Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) transponders (also called \\"toll tags\\"). The ETC transponders, which are uniquely identifiable, may be read not only at toll collection points (e.g. toll bridges) but also at many non-toll locations. This is used as a method to collect traffic flow data (which is anonymized) for the San Francisco Bay Area's 5-1-1 service.FasTrak Application and License Agreement , Toll Tags: section, last subsection: You agree that the Toll Tag may be read to provide anonymous traffic flow data to the Metropolitan Transportation Commission‚Äôs ‚Äò511‚Äô project, a real time traffic information service. No information identifying a FasTrak account, person or vehicle using the Toll Tag will be collected by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission or ‚Äò511‚Äô. In New York City's Midtown in Motion program, its adaptive traffic control system also use RFID readers to track movement of E-ZPass tags as a means of monitoring traffic flow. The data is fed through the government-dedicated broadband wireless infrastructure to the traffic management center to be used in adaptive traffic control of the traffic lights. Global Positioning System A small number of cars (typically fleet vehicles such as courier services and taxi drivers) are equipped with a box that contains a GPS receiver. The data are then communicated with the service provider using the regular on-board radio unit or via cellular network data (more expensive). It is possible that FCD could be used as a surveillance method, although the companies deploying FCD systems give assurances that all data are anonymized in their systems, or kept sufficiently secure to prevent abuses.

In the 1950s, he was a car salesman in the Dutch province of North Brabant. His nickname was The Black Rider, because he once appeared completely dressed in black at a party. On 15 November 1954, he fatally shot Jan van Dieten, a post office executive in Ravenstein. Gruyters was 29 at the time, and had already been convicted six times for lesser offences. On 16 November, he robbed a bank, and on December 31, he broke into a vicar's house in Volkel (a small village in Noord-Brabant), after which he ran a man over on a bike, killing the man in the process. By then, the police were on his trail, but this did not prevent him from trying to rob a bank in Oss some days later. He was eventually arrested on January 5, 1955, and sentenced to fifteen years in prison in 1956. In 1957, he escaped from the prison in Scheveningen, which was widely covered in the press, but was soon found and returned to his cell. He was released in 1966. After being released from prison he briefly embarked on a singing career without much success. Gruyters married twice; his first wife divorced him when he was in prison. After marrying a second time, he seems to have been a reformed character, building up a cleaning business that at one point employed more than 30 people. The second marriage produced one daughter. Gruyters died in 1980 after suffering a heart attack while riding his horse. He is buried in Rumpt.

Of Chinese Filipino descent, Sin was known for his instrumental role in the 1986 People Power Revolution, which toppled the regime of President Ferdinand Marcos and installed Corazon Aquino as his successor. He was again considered a charismatic leader of the Filipino people in the 2001 EDSA Revolution that replaced President Joseph Estrada with Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Sin died at the age of 76, due to renal complications resulting from diabetes. Early life Sin was born in New Washington, Aklan, Philippines to Juan Sin, a Hokkien Filipino from Xiamen and his wife, M√°xima Lachica, an ethnic Aklanon. \\"Jim\\", as he was known, was his mother's favorite. The 14th of 16 children, he was a painfully thin, asthmatic child, who often used to cuddle up between his parents to sleep at night. When he asked his nurse why his mother lavished such attention on him, he was told it was because he was the weakest and ugliest of the brood. He left his childhood home and his family to study in St. Vincent Ferrer Seminary, and was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Jaro on April 3, 1954. He was the first rector of St. Pius X Seminary in Lawaan Hills, Roxas City, Capiz, serving from 1957 to 1967. On February 29, 1960, he was named Domestic Prelate (present-day, honorary prelate with the title of Monsignor). He was appointed auxiliary bishop of Jaro on February 10, 1967, and was consecrated bishop of the titular see of Obba on March 18 of that year. On March 15, 1972, Sin was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Jaro, taking on administrative roles in the archdiocese, while holding the titular see of Massa Lubrense. On October 8, 1972, Sin was appointed Archbishop of Jaro. Archbishop of Manila Sin was appointed archbishop of Manila on January 21, 1974. Initially, he was reluctant to take on the role of leader of the Catholic Church in the Philippines.Stowe, Judy. \\"Cardinal Jaime Sin: Archbishop of Manila who saw his duty as being 'to put Christ in politics'\\", (obit), The Independent, 22 June 2005 He was officially installed as Archbishop of Manila at Manila Cathedral on March 19, 1974, making him only the third native Filipino in the office after centuries of Spanish, American, and Irish archbishops. On May 24, 1976, Pope Paul VI made him a member of the College of Cardinals, creating him Cardinal Priest of the titular church of Santa Maria ai Monti. He participated as a cardinal-elector in both the August and October papal conclaves which elected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II respectively. In the August conclave, he reportedly told Albino Luciani, \\"You will be the new pope.\\" After Luciani was elected as John Paul I, Cardinal Sin paid him homage, and the new pope said: \\"You were a prophet, but my reign will be a short one.\\" He remained the youngest member of the College until 1983. His title and surname as Cardinal Sin (another term for a deadly sin) were a point of humour in the Philippines and for Filipino Catholics. Examples included \\"The greatest sin of all: Cardinal Sin,\\" and even his own pun of \\"Welcome to the house of Sin\\" that he used to greet guests at Villa San Miguel, the archiepiscopal palace in Mandaluyong.Easton, Adam. \\"Cardinal Jaime Sin: Outspoken prelate with a key role in the fall of President Marcos\\", The Guardian (obit), 21 June 2005 People Power movement Events in the Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos forced Sin, the spiritual leader of Filipino Catholics, to become involved in politics. He became witness to corruption, fraud, and even murder by the regime and rising popular discontent with the dictatorial rule of Marcos and his wife, Imelda. Within six months of his appointment as Archbishop, Sin was criticizing authorities after the military raided a Manila seminary on the grounds that it was harbouring insurgents. Sin appealed to Filipinos of all religions to follow the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels and use peaceful means to change the political situation in the Philippines. Beginning in the 1970s, Cardinal Sin, a moderate, was among the leaders who publicly pressured President Marcos to end martial law, out of concern that leftist radicals would overthrow the government. Sin eventually decided to speak out in support of Corazon Aquino, the widow of the assassinated opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., in calling for an end to martial law. This led to massive popular demonstrations, often led by nuns whom riot police dared not attack. In February 1986, Sin called on Filipinos to surround the police and military headquarters in Manila to protect then-military Vice Chief of Staff Fidel Ramos, who had broken with Mr. Marcos. More than 1 million people took to the streets praying the rosary and singing hymns in an outpouring that shielded anti-government rebels from attack. Some soldiers decided to join the marchers. In what later became known as the People Power Revolution, Marcos, his family, and close advisors were forced to flee the Philippines and took up residence in Honolulu, Hawaii, upon the invitation of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Cardinal Sin, along with presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos, became known to Filipinos as the architects of the People Power Movement. Sin decided to intervene again, in 2001, to become spiritual leader of another People Power Movement. Some Filipinos alleged that president Joseph Estrada was guilty of widespread corruption and graft because of the controversial \\"second envelope\\". Poor people marching in the streets, with the support of Sin, the elite, and military generals, succeeded in toppling Estrada from power and elevating Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as acting president in what was perceived by the international community as a triumphant democracy. The \\"second envelope\\" was opened after the coup and turned out to be Estrada's bank account. Commenting on the endemic corruption that persisted after Marcos, Sin said, \\"We got rid of Ali Baba, but the 40 thieves remained.\\" It was reported that the cardinal's actions caused uneasiness at the Vatican and that he was summoned to Rome to explain himself.Weil, Martin. \\"Philippine Cardinal Jaime L. Sin Dies at 76\\", Washington Post, 21 June 2005 Hours before hundreds of soldiers and officers staged a failed revolt against President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in July 2003, he urged Filipinos to be vigilant against groups plotting to violently overturn the country's democratic institutions. Two and a half years after Sin's death, it was reported that at the height of EDSA II, Sin received a directive from the Vatican ordering him and the Philippine clergy to adopt a non-partisan stance towards the political crisis. Sin, who by then had committed support for the EDSA II revolt, was said to have threatened to resign as archbishop if compelled to withdraw his support. The standoff was reportedly resolved with the mediation of the then Supreme Court Associate Justice Artemio Panganiban (later, Chief Justice of the Philippines), a member of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, a department of the Roman Curia. As a result, the Vatican did not insist upon its earlier demand. The reports were attributed to persons reputed to have first-hand knowledge of the events, but there has been no official confirmation of them from the Vatican or from the Archdiocese of Manila. = After 1986 = =Views on condom use= As a predominantly Catholic country, issues in the Philippines have and are influenced by the Church in varying degrees. Condom usage has historically been a controversial topic. As the incumbent Archbishop of Manila in 1996, when the government distributed condoms to curb HIV infection rates, Sin called the programme \\"intrinsically evil\\", in line with Church teaching on the matter. Sin also denounced then-Health Secretary, Juan Flavier, with some asserting that the latter's condom-promotion had made him an unwitting agent of Satan. Prominent Catholics also protested against the government's condom- distribution programme by publicly burning boxes of condoms. Retirement and death Cardinal Sin retired as the Archbishop of Manila on September 15, 2003, and was succeeded by Lipa Archbishop Gaudencio Borbon Rosales. He was too ill to travel to the 2005 conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. Afflicted for years with a kidney ailment brought on by diabetes, he was taken on June 19, 2005, to the Cardinal Santos Medical Center in San Juan, Metro Manila, because of a slight but lingering fever. He died of renal failure on June 21, 2005, at the age of 76, two months before his 77th birthday.O'Donnell, Michelle. \\"Cardinal Jaime Sin, a Champion of the Poor in the Philippines, Is Dead at 76\\" (obit), The New York Times, 21 June 2005 The government accorded him the honour of a state funeral and a period of national mourning through Presidential Proclamation ‚Ññ 863, s. 2005 signed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

It may stem from bad relationships, loss of loved ones, deliberate choice, infectious disease, mental disorders, neurological disorders or circumstances of employment or situation (see castaway). Short- term solitude is often valued as a time when one may work, think or rest without being disturbed. It may be desired for the sake of privacy. A distinction has been made between solitude and loneliness. In this sense, these two words refer, respectively, to the joy and the pain of being alone.Paul Tillich, The Eternal Now, 1963, chapter 1 \\"Loneliness and Solitude\\", section II: \\"Our language has wisely sensed these two sides of being alone.

In solitude, in other words, I am 'by myself,' together with my self, and therefore two-in-one, whereas in loneliness I am actually one, deserted by all others.\\", . Solitude is a pivotal phenomenon in the thinking of existentialists, and reflections on it have been recently tied with pandemic lockdowns and self-isolation solitary confinement; for example as argued in: Nader El-Bizri, \\"Being in Solitary Quarantine\\", Studia UBB Philosophia, Vol. 65, No. 2 (2020): 7-32. Health effects Symptoms from complete isolation, called sensory deprivation, often include anxiety, sensory illusions, or even distortions of time and perception. However, this is the case when there is no stimulation of the sensory systems at all, and not only lack of contact with people. Thus, by having other things to keep one's mind busy, this is avoided. Still, long-term solitude is often seen as undesirable, causing loneliness or reclusion resulting from inability to establish relationships. Furthermore, it might even lead to clinical depression. However, for some people, solitude is not depressing. Still others (e.g. monks) regard long-term solitude as a means of spiritual enlightenment. Indeed, marooned people have been left in solitude for years without any report of psychological symptoms afterwards. Enforced loneliness (solitary confinement) has been a punishment method throughout history. It is often considered a form of torture. In contrast, some psychological conditions (such as schizophrenia and schizoid personality disorder) are strongly linked to a tendency to seek solitude. Emotional isolation is a state of isolation where one has a well-functioning social network but still feels emotionally separated from others. Recently, however, researchers like Robert J. Coplan and Julie C. Bowker have rejected the notion that solitary practices and solitude are inherently dysfunctional and undesirable. In their book The Handbook of Solitude, the authors note how solitude can allow for enhancements in self-esteem, generates clarity, and can be highly therapeutic. In the edited work, Coplan and Bowker invite not only fellow psychology colleagues to chime in on this issue, but they also invite a variety of other faculty from different disciplines to address the issue. Arguably the most interesting of these alternative views comes from Fong's chapter on how solitude is more than just a personal trajectory for one to take inventory on life; it also yields a variety of important sociological cues that allow the protagonist to navigate through society, even highly politicized societies. In the process, political prisoners in solitary confinement were examined to see how they concluded their views on society. Thus Fong, Coplan, and Bowker conclude that a person's experienced solitude generates immanent and personal content as well as collective and sociological content, depending on context. Psychological effects Breslover Hasid practicing hitbodedut. There are both positive and negative psychological effects of solitude. Much of the time, these effects and the longevity is determined by the amount of time a person spends in isolation. The positive effects can range anywhere from more freedom to increased spirituality,Long, Christopher R. and Averill, James R. ‚ÄúSolitude: An Exploration of the Benefits of Being Alone.‚Äù Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour 33:1 (2003): Web. 30 September 2011. while the negative effects are socially depriving and may trigger the onset of mental illness.Kupers, Terry A. ‚ÄúWhat To Do With the Survivors? Coping With the Long- Term Effects of Isolated Confinement‚Äù. Criminal Justice and Behavior 35.8 (2008): Web. 30 September 2011. While positive solitude is often desired, negative solitude is often involuntary or undesired at the time it occurs. =Positive effects= There are many benefits to spending time alone. Freedom is considered to be one of the benefits of solitude; the constraints of others will not have any effect on a person who is spending time in solitude, therefore giving the person more latitude in their actions. With increased freedom, a person‚Äôs choices are less likely to be affected by exchanges with others. A person's creativity can be sparked when given freedom. Solitude can increase freedom and moreover, freedom from distractions has the potential to spark creativity. In 1994, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi found that adolescents who cannot bear to be alone often stop enhancing creative talents. Another proven benefit to time given in solitude is the development of self. When a person spends time in solitude from others, they may experience changes to their self-concept. This can also help a person to form or discover their identity without any outside distractions. Solitude also provides time for contemplation, growth in personal spirituality, and self-examination. In these situations, loneliness can be avoided as long as the person in solitude knows that they have meaningful relations with others. =Negative effects= Too much solitude is not always considered beneficial. Many of the negative effects have been observed in prisoners. Often, prisoners spend extensive time in solitude, where their behavior may worsen. Solitude can trigger physiological responses that increase health risks. Negative effects of solitude may also depend on age. Elementary age school children who experience frequent solitude may react negatively. This is largely because, often, solitude at this age is not something chosen by the child. Solitude in elementary-age children may occur when they are unsure of how to interact socially with others so they prefer to be alone, causing shyness or social rejection. While teenagers are more likely to feel lonely or unhappy when not around others, they are also more likely to have a more enjoyable experience with others if they have had time alone first. However, teenagers who frequently spend time alone do not have as good a global adjustment as those who balance their time of solitude with their social time. Other uses =As pleasure= Howard Pyle's 19th century illustration of a marooned pirate. Solitude does not necessarily entail feelings of loneliness, and in fact may, for those who choose it with deliberate intent, be one's sole source of genuine pleasure. Some individuals seek solitude for discovering a more meaningful and vital existence. For example, in religious contexts, some saints preferred silence and found immense pleasure in their perceived uniformity with God. Solitude is a state that can be positively modified utilizing it for prayer allowing to \\"be alone with ourselves and with God, to put ourselves in listening to his will, but also of what moves in our hearts, let purify our relationships; solitude and silence thus become spaces inhabited by God, and ability to recover ourselves and grow in humanity. \\" / The Buddha attained enlightenment through uses of meditation, deprived of sensory input, bodily necessities, and external desires, including social interaction. The context of solitude is attainment of pleasure from within, but this does not necessitate complete detachment from the external world. Solitude and the Sea, a theme by Jacques Bodin This is well demonstrated in the writings of Edward Abbey with particular regard to Desert Solitaire where solitude focused only on isolation from other people allows for a more complete connection to the external world, as in the absence of human interaction the natural world itself takes on the role of the companion. In this context, the individual seeking solitude does so not strictly for personal gain or introspection, though this is often an unavoidable outcome, but instead in an attempt to gain an understanding of the natural world as entirely removed from the human perspective as possible, a state of mind much more readily attained in the complete absence of outside human presence. In psychology, introverted individuals may require spending time away from people to recharge. Those who are simply socially apathetic might find it a pleasurable environment in which to occupy oneself with solitary tasks. =As punishment= Isolation in the form of solitary confinement is a punishment or precaution used in many countries throughout the world for prisoners accused of serious crimes, those who may be at risk in the prison population, those who may commit suicide, or those unable to participate in the prison population due to sickness or injury. Research has found that solitary confinement does not deter inmates from committing further violence in prison. =As treatment= Psychiatric institutions may institute full or partial isolation for certain patients, particularly the violent or subversive, in order to address their particular needs and to protect the rest of the recovering population from their influence.

A person, couple, or larger group may go to a secluded place for privacy or peace and quiet. The seclusion of an individual is called solitude. Restrictions on the seclusion of a man and a woman In some cases where there are legal, religious or social restrictions on two people having physical intimacy, there may be restrictions on being together in a secluded place. For example, under traditional schools of sharia or Islamic law, a man and a woman who are not married and not mahram, being together in a house, a bathroom, or a secluded place, may be forbidden. A man and woman could be in a secluded area for work purposes, just talking, or anything that does not allow them to pass their limits. See also yichud‚Äîa similar rule in Judaism. As a therapy Seclusion may be used as a control tactic in psychological treatment settings. Seclusion of an agitated person in a quiet room free of stimulation may help de-escalate a situation which may be dangerous to the agitated person or those around him. In relation to administering medications, seclusion is a tactic devised for those unwilling to proceed with instructions. Patients who are secluded due to aggressive behaviour should not be restrained to seclusion nor medication to calm them instead restraint measures should be taken into consideration. Other measures, such as behavioural therapy, should be considered when assessing the care of the patient. Seclusion must only be used in the best interest of the patient, it must only be used as a last resort method, and it must not be prolonged as a form of punishment on the patient. In Ireland, The Mental Health Commission governs seclusion in psychiatric institutions. The act states that people can only be placed in seclusion if * it prevents them from hurting themselves and/or others * and it complies with the rules set out by the commission. To prevent contagious disease transmission self-isolation is used as a public health measure.

Talbot premiered his first opera in January 2015 with Dallas Opera, a one-act work entitled Everest to a libretto by Gene Scheer, which follows three of the climbers involved in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. Background Talbot was born in August 1971 in Wimbledon, London. He grew up in Mitcham, south London, and attended King's College School, Wimbledon, on a music scholarship from the age of eight. Talbot played the piano and oboe, studied composition privately with Brian Elias and after receiving a Bachelor of Music from Royal Holloway University of London, he completed a Master of Music (Composition) at Guildhall School of Music and Drama under Simon Bainbridge.About Joby, Joby Talbot website. Early career and concert works Though classically trained, Talbot's early career centred on film and television scores and pop arrangements. His work as arranger and keyboardist with Neil Hannon's band The Divine Comedy continued from 1993 until 2002. He also played saxophone on the song \\"Time of Legends\\" for gothic rock band NOSFERATU, appearing on their 1993 single \\"Savage Kiss\\" and their 1994 album The Prophecy. In 1999, following some minor television scoring jobs, Talbot was commissioned to write the theme and score for BBC Two's comedy series The League of Gentlemen, for which he was awarded the Royal Television Society Award for Best Title Music and which he would continue to score throughout its three series and film, The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse (2005). Talbot was commissioned, also in 1999, by the British Film Institute to provide a new score for Alfred Hitchcock's 1927 silent film The Lodger, and again in 2002 the BFI had Talbot write a piano trio to accompany Evgenii Bauer's The Dying Swan (1917). Concert works of this period include Luminescence (1997) for the BBC Philharmonic; Falling (1998), written for cellist Phillip Sheppard; Incandescence (1998) for percussion and orchestra, commissioned by the Brunel Ensemble and later toured by Evelyn Glennie and the London Sinfonietta; String Quartet No. 1 (1999) and No. 2 (2002), for the Duke Quartet; the saxophone quartet Blue Cell (2001) for the Apollo Saxophone Quartet; and Minus 1500 (2001) for bassoon, percussion, strings and piano, commissioned by the London Sinfonietta. During this time, Talbot also completed a popular reworking of Portishead's 'All Mine' for The Divine Comedy's contribution to Tom Jones' covers album Reload (1999). In 2002, Talbot wrote The Wishing Tree, a short a cappella madrigal setting a text by Kathleen Jamie, for The King's Singers, commissioned by the ensemble and The Proms as part of the Queen's Golden Jubilee. Subsequent to this, Talbot was asked by Nigel Short, artistic director of chamber choir Tenebrae, to create a work that described the ancient Christian pilgrimage route across northern Spain to Santiago de Compostela. The resultant piece was the hour- long, a cappella journey Path of Miracles, setting multilingual texts collated by Robert Dickinson, which has steadily gained popularity with vocal ensembles and audiences. Sneaker Wave (2004) for the BBC National Orchestra of Wales was Talbot's second Proms commission, and also in that year, he was appointed Classic FM's inaugural Composer-in-Residence, a project which involved the composition of one short piece for small ensemble per month and resulted in the album Once Around the Sun (2005 Sony BMG). In 2006, Talbot wrote the trumpet concerto Desolation Wilderness for soloist Alison Balsom and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and Turku Philharmonic Orchestras. A third work for the Proms was Talbot's 2011 arrangement of Purcell's Chacony in G Minor for the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The next year, Talbot was commissioned by the Philharmonia Orchestra to write an eighth movement to Holst's The Planets, as part of their interactive installation Universe of Sound at the Science Museum, London. The work, entitled Worlds, Stars, Systems, Infinity premiered at The Royal Festival Hall, London, in 2012, as part of the 2012 London Cultural Olympiad. Works for dance =Collaborations with Wayne McGregor= Among the pieces composed as part of Talbot's Classic FM residency are A Yellow Disc Rising from the Sea, Transit of Venus and Cloudpark, all of which went on to form part of Talbot's score for the Royal Ballet production Chroma (2005), his first collaboration with current Royal Ballet Resident Choreographer Wayne McGregor C.B.E. McGregor had heard Talbot's 2004 orchestral work Hovercraft and approached him about creating a larger score around this. The remaining elements of the Chroma score are the tracks 'Aluminum', 'Blue Orchid' and 'Hardest Button to Button' from Talbot's 2005 instrumental covers album of songs by The White Stripes, entitled Aluminium, a project conceived and executed in partnership with XL Recordings founder Richard Russell, and Talbot's long-time collaborator, the conductor and orchestrator Christopher Austin. Chroma won the South Bank Show Award for Dance and an Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production, and continues to be staged by numerous companies internationally, including the Bolshoi Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet, National Ballet of Canada, Boston Ballet, The Australian Ballet and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Following Chroma, McGregor and Talbot collaborated on two further works, Genus (2007) for the Paris Opera Ballet, for which Talbot produced an electro- acoustic score with LA-based electronic musician Deru; and Entity (2008) for McGregor's company Random Dance, a score divided between electro-acoustic string works by Talbot, and an electronic score by Jon Hopkins. Talbot's half was adapted from his string quartet Manual Override, originally commissioned in 2007 by Singapore's T'ang Quartet; and from the 2005 cello work Motion Detector, written for cellist Maya Beiser. =Collaborations with Christopher Wheeldon= Subsequent to Chroma, Talbot became increasingly involved in projects for dance, adapting his 2002 score for Evgenii Bauer's silent film The Dying Swan to score Fool's Paradise, a short 2007 work devised by choreographer Christopher Wheeldon for his company Morphoses and later integrated into the repertoire of The Royal Ballet, where Wheeldon is currently Artistic Associate. When Wheeldon was appointed to choreograph The Royal Ballet's first new, full-length narrative ballet commissioned in almost 20 years, he approached Talbot to write the score.Toronyi-Lalic, Igor \\"Joby Talbot heads down the rabbit hole for the Royal Ballet's Alice\\", The Times, 28 February 2011 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, commissioned jointly by the Royal and the National Ballet of Canada, premiered at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden on 28 February 2011, and at the Four Seasons Performing Arts Centre, Toronto, on 4 June 2011. The production has had its third consecutive run with The Royal Ballet in March 2013 and has thus far been successfully toured to Los Angeles and Washington D.C. by the National Ballet of Canada. The New York Times stated in 2011: \\"Mr. Talbot's score is the trump card for Alice.\\"Sulcas, Roslyn. \\"Alice on Her Toes, at a Rare Tea Party\\", The New York Times, 1 March 2011 The 2012 and 2013 productions received very good to excellent reviews.Hutera, Donald. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland at Covent Garden\\", The Times, 19 March 2012Jays, David. \\"A magic potion\\", The Sunday Times, 24 March 2013 Talbot was praised for his \\"sublimely witty score, which seems to use every instrument to match the sounds from the pit to the action on the stage, creating a lush soundscape that drives the action.\\"Crompton, Sarah. \\"Alice in Wonderland, Royal Ballet, review\\", The Daily Telegraph, 17 March 2013 A suite from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, along with the score from the duo's first collaboration Fool's Paradise, was recorded in London in November 2012 by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Christopher Austin and released in January 2013. In May 2013, Wheeldon choreographed sections of an orchestral version of Talbot's 2009 work Tide Harmonic for Pacific Northwest Ballet, under the same title. In London in April 2014, the pair premiered a second full-length narrative work for The Royal Ballet and National Ballet of Canada, an adaptation of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. Talbot commented that he spent two years thinking about 'nothing else.' The project proved especially challenging as he was composing music to be played by unusual instruments and the contrasting nature of each act from one to three made it feel he had to 'start again' twice more.Interview on Opus Arte DVD 2015 The critical reception was favourable with five stars from The Times and The Telegraph and four from the Financial Times and The Guardian, which called the work 'a ballet to keep'. The Winter's Tale was premiered in North America by the National Ballet of Canada in Toronto in November 2015 and returned to Covent Garden the following year. With some amendment it was performed again at the Royal Opera House in 2018. =Eau and Chamber= French choreographers Carolyn Carlson and Medhi Walerski have both created works to specially commissioned scores by Talbot. Carlson's production Eau for CCN Roubaix and the Orchestre National de Lille had its premiere in Lille in 2008, and Talbot later adapted the score as Tide Harmonic, a five-movement chamber work released on Signum Classics in 2011. Walerski's Chamber was choreographed to Talbot's Chamber Symphony (2012) for Netherlands Dance Theatre and the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, and premiered in The Hague in October 2012. The piece formed part of a worldwide programming focus on the 100th anniversary of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring (1913). Screen scores and arrangements Talbot has continued to write for film and television, with notable scores including The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Garth Jennings, 2005); Penelope (Mark Palansky, 2006); Son of Rambow (Garth Jennings, 2007); Is Anybody There? (John Crowley, 2008); Franklyn (Gerald McMorrow, 2008); Burke and Hare (John Landis, 2010); and Hunky Dory (Marc Evans, 2011), for which Talbot developed orchestral arrangements of pop songs with the film's young actors and musicians, alongside writing the largely electronic score. Following his work on BBC Two comedy series The League of Gentlemen (1999‚Äì2002), Talbot wrote the theme and, with Jeremy Holland-Smith, the score for League co-creators and actors Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's new series, Psychoville (2011‚Äì12). Further work for the BBC has included the theme and (with Jeremy Holland-Smith and Richard Chester) score for the popular children's series Tracy Beaker Returns (2010‚Äì12). Talbot also wrote the theme for the forthcoming BBC One drama series Frankie.

It is currently one of the most active volcanoes in the world, along with Kƒ´lauea in the Hawaiian Islands, Stromboli and Etna in Italy and Mount Erebus in Antarctica. A previous eruption began in August 2006 and ended in January 2007. The volcano erupted again in February 2007, on 21 September 2008, on 9 December 2010, which lasted for two days, and on 1 August 2015. The most recent eruption began on 2 April 2020. The volcano is located within R√©union National Park, a World Heritage site. Piton de la Fournaise is often known locally as le Volcan (\\"the Volcano\\"); it is a major tourist attraction on R√©union island. Geology The uppermost section of the volcano is occupied by the Enclos Fouqu√©, a caldera wide. High cliffs, known as remparts in French, form the caldera's rim. The caldera is breached to the southeast towards the sea. The eastern flank of the volcano is unstable and is in the initial stages of failure. It will eventually collapse into the Indian Ocean, but whether or not it will generate a \\"megatsunami\\" is controversial. There is evidence of earlier failures on the submerged flanks and surrounding abyssal plain. The lower slopes are known as the Grand Br√ªl√© (\\"Great Burn\\"). Most volcanic eruptions are confined to the caldera. Inside the caldera is a high lava shield named Dolomieu. At the top of this lava shield are Bory Crater (Crat√®re Bory) and Dolomieu Crater (Crat√®re Dolomieu), which is by far the wider of the two and named for French geologist D√©odat Gratet de Dolomieu. Topographic map showing the volcano and surrounding terrain Many craters and spatter cones can be found inside the caldera and on the higher flanks of the volcano. Lavas with high concentrations of iridium are routinely ejected through these vents. By the trailhead of the summit path there lies a small noteworthy crater called Formica Leo, named for its resemblance to the sand pit trap of an antlion. Located outside of the main caldera is Commerson Crater, an extinct caldera notable for receiving intense rainfall, particularly during tropical storms. During Cyclone Hyacinthe in January 1980, it received of rainfall in 15 days, the most precipitation produced by a tropical cyclone in a single location. Some beaches in the proximity of the volcano are greenish in color, due to olivine sand derived from picrite basalt lavas. The Grand Br√ªl√© is formed from solidified lava flows accumulated over hundreds of thousands of years; the most recent ones are often the darkest and most vegetation-free, while older ones can be covered by dense natural vegetation. This volcano is over 530,000 years old, and for most of its history, its flows have intermingled with those from Piton des Neiges, a larger, older and heavily eroded extinct volcano which forms the northwest two-thirds of R√©union Island. There were three episodes of caldera collapses 250,000, 65,000 and 5,000 years ago. The volcano was formed by the R√©union hotspot, which is believed to have been active for the past 66 million years. There is evidence for explosive eruptions in the past. One explosive eruption about 4,700 years ago may have had a VEI (Volcanic Explosivity Index) of 5, which is the same as the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Eruptions The erupting lava met the water of the Indian Ocean during the August 2004 eruption. Video of a lava flow in August 2019 2004 eruption Animated map of eruptions between 1972 and 2000. Most eruptions of Piton de la Fournaise are of the Hawaiian style: fluid basaltic lava flowing out with fire fountaining at the vent. Occasionally, phreatic eruptions (groundwater steam- generated eruptions) occur. Lava flows crossing the Grand Br√ªl√© occasionally reach the sea. Piton de la Fournaise is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, with more than 150 recorded eruptions since the 17th century. Eruptions within the caldera do not cause much devastation, because the caldera is uninhabited, but little infrastructure exists apart from the highway. Lava flows are generally confined to the caldera. However, lava flows have been known to cross the N2 highway; areas where the road was destroyed by the eruption are signposted with the year of eruption after the road is rebuilt. In the early 2000s, the highway was destroyed one or more times a year; road engineering services then wait for the lava to cool off and build another stretch of road. For months after an eruption, the core of the lava flows can still be hot enough to steam in rainy weather. Eruptions outside of the caldera can pose serious hazards to the population, but are rare. Only six eruptions outside of the caldera have been recorded, most recently in 1986. The village of Piton-Sainte-Rose was evacuated in 1977 before it was inundated by a lava flow which destroyed several buildings. The lava flow crossed the highway and surrounded the local church, entered the front door, then stopped without destroying the building. The front entrance was later cleared out, and the church was brought back into service under the name of Notre-Dame des Laves (\\"Our Lady of the Lavas\\"). In April 2007 the volcano erupted and produced an estimated 3,000,000 cubic metres per day. During this eruption of 2007 an incremental caldera collapse of Dolomieu occurred at the volcano over more than nine days. The collapse displacing 0.8 x 1.1 km floor downward by 330 m, with a volume of 120 million cubic metres. The caldera collapse accompanied one of the largest eruptions of lava at the volcano in the past 100 years. Monitoring Volcanic activity is constantly monitored by geophysical sensors (tiltmeters, extensometers, differential GPS receivers, etc.). The data from those various sensors is sent to the Piton de la Fournaise Volcano Observatory, located in Bourg-Murat, northwest of the volcano. The observatory, founded in 1978 following the Piton-Sainte-Rose flow, is operated by the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (Global Geophysics Institute of Paris), in association with CNRS and the University of R√©union. The OVPF often publishes reports on Piton de la Fournaise's current activity via their website in French. RIGIC (the R√©union Island Geological Information Center) takes this information and translates it into English for distribution to the English-speaking scientific community. Procedures specify several levels of alert, which are decided by the prefect of R√©union on the basis of scientific reports: * Pre-alert: Warnings about possible eruptions; hikers accessing the caldera are warned about possible developments. * Level 1: An eruption will occur soon; the public may not access the caldera until specialists have examined the situation and set pathways for those willing to admire the eruption. * Level 2: An eruption is occurring inside the caldera. Access to the caldera is restricted to authorized personnel only. * Level 3: An eruption is occurring or will occur soon outside of the caldera; some villages may have to be evacuated for safety. Visit The gate for the visitors who want to climb the volcano A forestry road followed by a track connects the highway of the plains in Bourg-Murat to the Pas de Bellecombe (Bellecombe Pass), where a parking lot and a snack bar are located. The Pas de Bellecombe is situated over the caldera rim cliffs and offers a view over the northeast part of the caldera. A stairway path descends from the pass to the caldera floor. This path is closed for safety reasons during seismic events that may precede eruptions and during eruptions. White paint marks over rocks delimit a number of footpaths ascending the lava shield inside the caldera. The lower parts of the Grand Br√ªl√© can be visited from the N2 highway. Lava flows that have crossed the road are indicated by signs. Completely free access during eruptions was permitted until 1998; access has been limited since that date, being virtually banned at present.

The region is part of the Delmarva Peninsula and is separated from the rest of Virginia by the Chesapeake Bay. Its population was 45,553 as of 2010.U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Census of Population and Housing, Population and Housing Unit Counts, CPH-2-48, Virginia, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 2012, pp. 6 & 7. The terrain is overall very flat, ranging from sea level to just above sea level. It is characterized by sandy and deep soil. The weather in the area has temperate summers and winters, significantly affected by the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.\\"Virginia's Eastern Shore (AVA): Appellation Description\\", Appellation America, 2007, Retrieved Jan. 31, 2008 The rural area has long been devoted to cotton, soybean, vegetable and truck farming, and large-scale chicken farms. Since the late 20th century, vineyards have been developed in both counties, and the Eastern Shore has received recognition as an American Viticultural Area (AVA). The region has more than 78,000 acres of preserved parks, refuges, preserves and a national seashore and is a popular outdoor recreation destination for fishing, boating, hiking and kayaking. It is also an important birding hotspot along the Atlantic Flyway at the southernmost tip of the Delmarva Peninsula. There are public beaches at Cape Charles, Kiptopeke State Park, Savage Neck Dunes Natural Area Preserve, Tangier Island and the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge abutting the Assateague Island National Seashore. The area includes 70 miles of barrier islands, the longest chain of undeveloped barrier islands in the global temperate zone and a United Nations International Biosphere Reserve. At the northern end of the Atlantic side is the beach community of Chincoteague, famous for its annual wild pony roundup, gathered from Assateague Island. Wallops Flight Facility, a NASA space launch base, is located near Chincoteague. At the southern end of the Chesapeake Bay coast, the beach community of Cape Charles, a historic railroad town, is home to the Cape Charles Yacht Center, a super yacht service center. The town of Wachapreague on the Atlantic coast is a popular destination for fishing and guided trips out to the wild barrier islands. Onancock, a harbor town on the Chesapeake Bay, has a ferry service to Tangier Island, off the western shore in the Chesapeake Bay, during spring, summer and fall. The Eastern Shore, geographically removed from the rest of Virginia, has had a unique history of settlement and development influenced by agriculture, fishing, tourism, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. William G. Thomas describes the Eastern Shore during the late 19th and early 20th century as \\"a highly complex and interdependent landscape\\". He continues: > It was a liminal place, a zone of interpenetration, where the settlement > patterns, speech, demography, and political outcomes defined its place in > the South but its engagement with technology and rapid transformation of the > landscape betrayed other allegiances, motives, forces, and effects.William > G.

Before the Chesapeake Bay Bridge‚ÄìTunnel was built in 1964, the Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry provided the continuation of U.S. 13 across this stretch of water. History Accomac Shire was established in the Virginia Colony by the House of Burgesses in 1634 under the direction of King Charles I. It was one of the original eight shires of Virginia, and consisted of the whole of Virginia's Delmarva territory. The shire's name comes from the Native American word Accawmack, which means, \\"the other shore\\". In 1642, the name was changed to Northampton County. (In England, \\"shires\\" and \\"counties\\" are the same thing). In 1663, Northampton County was split into two counties. The northern two thirds took the original Accomac name, while the southern third remained as Northampton. In 1670, the Virginia Colony's Royal Governor William Berkeley abolished Accomac County, but the Virginia General Assembly re-created it in 1671. In 1940, the General Assembly officially added a \\"k\\" to the end of the county's name to arrive at its current spelling, which is Accomack. Media The area is served by the weekly Eastern Shore Post and the monthly publication Eastern Shore First. The predominant radio station is WESR 103.3 FM, which operates the website ShoreDailyNews.com. Politics The Eastern Shore is politically divided, with Accomack County generally voting for the Republican Party and Northampton County generally voting for the Democratic Party. As a whole, the Shore slightly tilts Republican owing to Accomack's larger share of the population. In the 2017 gubernatorial election, it gave 50.5% of the vote to Republican Ed Gillespie and 49.0% of the vote to Democrat Ralph Northam. It is represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Democrat Elaine Luria, in the Virginia Senate by Democrat Lynwood Lewis, and in the Virginia House of Delegates by Republican Robert Bloxom Jr..

It lives farther north than any other species of non-marine reptile, and most populations are viviparous (giving birth to live young), rather than laying eggs as most other lizards do. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Zootoca.Harris, D. J. and M. A. Carretero. (2003). Comments on the taxonomic value of (sub)genera within the family Lacertidae (Reptilia). Amphibia-Reptilia 24 119-22. Both \\"Zootoca\\" and \\"vivipara\\" mean \\"live birth,\\" in Greek and Latin respectively. It was called Lacerta vivipara until the genus Lacerta was split into nine genera in 2007 by Arnold, Arribas & Carranza. Zootoca vivipara can be seen in a variety of different colours. Female Zootoca vivipara undergo colour polymorphism more commonly than males. A female lizard's display differs in ventral colouration, ranging from pale yellow to bright orange and a mixed colouration. There have been many hypothesis for the genetic cause of this polymorphic colouration. These hypothesis test for colouration due to thermoregulation, predator avoidance, and social cues, specifically sexual reproduction. Through an experiment conducted by Vercken et al., colour polymorphism in viviparous lizard is caused by social cues, rather than the other hypotheses. More specifically, the ventral colouration that is seen in female lizards is associated with patterns of sexual reproduction and sex allocation.Vercken, E., Massot, M., Sinervo, B., Clobert, J.2006. Colour Variation and Alternative Reproductive Strategies in Females of the Common Lizard Lacerta vivipara. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 20(1): 221-232 Identification Viviparous lizard The length of the body is less than (excluding the tail). The tail is up to twice as long as the body, although it is often partially or wholly lost. The limbs are short, and the head is rather round. Males have more slender bodies than females. The neck and the tail are thick. The collar and other scales seem jagged. The colour and patterning of this species is variable. The main colour is typically medium brown, but it can be also grey, olive brown or black. Females may have dark stripes on their flanks and down the middle of their backs. Sometimes females also have light-coloured stripes, or dark and light spots along the sides of their backs. Most males and some females have dark spots in their undersides. Males have brightly coloured undersides - typically yellow or orange, but more rarely red. Females have paler, whitish underparts. The throat is white, sometimes blue. Range The viviparous lizard is widely distributed throughout Europe and Asia. Its range extends to the north of the Arctic Circle. It ranges from Ireland to Hokkaido and Sakhalin. It is absent from most of the Mediterranean area, although it occurs in northern Spain, Northern Italy, Serbia, North Macedonia and Bulgaria. It is also absent from the area surrounding the Black Sea. Melanistic specimens are typical for the Gro√üer Feldberg mountain in Germany Female In the southern parts of its distribution range, the species lives at high elevations, occurring as high as above sea level in the Alps. In these areas, the viviparous lizard lives in damp locations, often near water, including meadows, swamps, rice fields, by brooks and in damp forests. In the northern part of the range, the species is also found in lowlands, where it occurs in drier environments, including open woodland, meadows, moorland, heathland, fens, dunes, rocks, roadsides, hedgerows and gardens. It lives mainly on the ground, although it may climb onto rocks, logs and low-growing vegetation.It is also the only reptile native to the island of Ireland. Behaviour The viviparous lizard feeds on invertebrates, mostly small insects and spiders. It shakes larger prey in its jaws before chewing it and swallowing it whole. In early spring, late autumn, and cool summer days, it basks in the sun to reach its optimum body temperature, which is about . These lizards mate in April or May. Males take females in their jaws before mating - if the female is not interested, she will bite the male fiercely. The offspring develops inside the female for about three months. The name of the species is derived from its ability to give birth to live young, an adaptation to a cool climate, but some southern populations are oviparous (egg-laying). The three to ten young (or eggs) are usually produced in July. The blackish young measure about , and when first born are surrounded by egg membrane, from which they break free after about a day. Males reach sexual maturity at the age of two years, females at the age of three years. Individuals from viviparous and oviparous populations may be hybridised, but with significant embryonic malformation.Heulin, B., Arrayago, M. J., and Bea, A. 1989. Exp√©rience d'hybridation entre les souches ovipare et vivipare du l√©zard Lacerta vivipara. Comp. Rend. Acad. Sci. Series 3 308: 341-346 (cited by the Reptile Database). Viviparous Z. vivipara do develop placentae to facilitate pregnancy but there is no substantial transport of nutrients as seen in some other species of viviparous reptiles (e.g. Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii). Due to the cool climate, in northern regions, viviparous lizards begin hibernation in September or October, underground or in log piles. Hibernation ends about mid- February. Further south, the species is active throughout the year. Colour polymorphism The colour polymorphism of female Zootoca vivipara has not been thoroughly studied in past years, regardless of the extensive research done on the species itself.Svensson, E.I., Abbott, J., Gosden, T., Coreau, A. 2009. Female polymorphisms, sexual conflict, and limits to speciation processes in animals. Behavioral Evology 23(1) 93-108. Female lizards exhibit three types of body colouration within a population: yellow, orange, and mixture of the two. These discrete traits are inherited maternally and exist throughout the individual's lifetime. The organism's colour morphs are determined by their genotype as well as their environment. The frequency of multiple morphs occurring in a population varies with the level of population density and frequency-dependent environments. These factors cause the lizards to vary in terms of their fitness (clutch size, sex ratio, hatching success). In lower density populations, colour polymorphism is more prevalent. This is because viviparous lizards thrive in environments where intraspecific competition is low.Vercken, E., Sinervo B., Clobert, J. 2012. The Importance of a good neighborhood: dispersal decisions in juvenile common lizards are based on social environment. Behavioral Ecology 23(5) 1059-1067 Increased competition among individuals results in lower survival rates of lizards. Additionally, female lizards disperse through habitats based on the frequency of colour types that are already present in the population. Their reproductive abilities vary according to this frequency-dependent environment. The number of offspring that they produce correlates with the colour morph: yellow females produce the fewest offspring, while orange females produce more than yellow, but fewer than mixed females, which produce the most offspring. The amount of offspring produced varies in regards to colour frequencies in the population; for example, if yellow females have higher density within the population, the clutch size for orange lizards is usually lower. Orange females are more sensitive to intraspecific and colour-specific competition. They have smaller clutch sizes when the density of the population is high, or when the number of yellow females in the population is high. This could be due to their need to conserve energy for survival and reproductive events. Their colour morph remains in the population due to the trade-off between the size of offspring and the clutch size. Offspring born in smaller clutches are often larger and thus have a higher survival likelihood. Natural selection will favor individuals with larger size because of their advantage in physical competition with others. Yellow females have larger clutch sizes early in their life, but their hatch success decreases as the female ages. Their reproductive viability decreases, resulting in fewer offspring throughout their lifetime. Yellow morphs remain in the population due to their large clutch size, which causes an increased frequency of those females. Selection favors the yellow morph because of the ability to produce large clutch sizes, which increases the female's fitness. In mixed-coloured females, reproductive success is less sensitive to competition and frequency-dependent environments. Since these lizards show a mixture of yellow and orange colouration, they adopt benefits from both of the morphs. As a result, they can maintain high reproductive success and hatching success with large clutch sizes. Their colour morph remains in the population due to its high fitness, which selection will favor. All three colours have evolutionary advantages in different ways. While yellow females have higher fitness due to their large clutch sizes, orange females enjoy high fitness due to their large body size and increased competitive advantages. Mixed females exhibit both of these advantages. Notes References *E. N. Arnold, J. A. Burton (1978). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Britain and Europe. *Ji≈ô√≠ ƒåiha≈ô (1994).

The command is designed to be a dependable back-end that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and investigation tool, since it can produce almost any kind of connection its user could need and has a number of built-in capabilities. Its list of features includes port scanning, transferring files, and port listening, and it can be used as a backdoor.

On the listening host, i.e. on the server whose port needs to be checked, do the following: nc -l -u -p 4171 On the sending host, do the following ‚Äì note that \`servname\` is the hostname of the listening host: nc -u servname 4172 If text typed on the sending host (type something and hit enter) is displayed also on the listening host, then the UDP port 4172 is open. If it is not open, you will get an error such as \\"Connection refused\\". There is a caveat. On some machines, IPv6 may be the default IP version to use by \`netcat\`. Thus, the host specified by the hostname is contacted using IPv6, and the user might not know about this. Ports may appear closed in the test, even though they would be open when using IPv4. This can be difficult to notice and may cause the false impression that the port is blocked, while it is actually open. You can force the use of IPv4 by using adding \`-4\` to the options of the \`nc\` commands. =Pipe via UDP (-u) with a wait time (-w) of 1 second to \\"loggerhost\\" on port 514= echo '<0>message'  nc -w 1 -u loggerhost 514 =Port scanning= An uncommon use of \`netcat\` is port scanning. Netcat is not considered the best tool for this job, but it can be sufficient (a more advanced tool is nmap) nc -v -n -z -w 1 192.168.1.2 1-1000 The \`-n\` parameter here prevents DNS lookup, \`-z\` makes \`nc\` not receive any data from the server, and \`-w 1\` makes the connection timeout after 1 second of inactivity. =Proxying= Another useful behaviour is using \`netcat\` as a proxy. Both ports and hosts can be redirected. Look at this example: nc -l 12345  nc www.google.com 80 Port 12345 represents the request. This starts a \`nc\` server on port 12345 and all the connections get redirected to \`google.com:80\`. If a web browser makes a request to \`nc\`, the request will be sent to google but the response will not be sent to the web browser. That is because pipes are unidirectional. This can be worked around with a named pipe to redirect the input and output. mkfifo backpipe nc -l 12345 0backpipe The \`-c\` option may also be used with the \`ncat\` implementation: ncat -l 12345 -c 'nc www.google.com 80' Using a named pipe is a more reliable method because using \`-c\` option provides only a one-shot proxy. Another useful feature is to proxy SSL connections. This way, the traffic can not be viewed in wire sniffing applications such as wireshark. This can be accomplished on UNIXes by utilizing \`mkfifo\`, \`netcat\`, and \`openssl\`. mkfifo tmp mkfifo tmp2 nc -l 8080 -k > tmp < tmp2 & while true; do openssl s_client -connect www.google.com:443 -quiet < tmp > tmp2 done =Making any process a server= \`netcat\` can be used to make any process a network server. It can listen on a port and pipe the input it receives to that process. The \`-e\` option spawns the executable with its input and output redirected via network socket. For example, it is possible to expose a bourne shell process to remote computers. To do so, on a computer A with IP address 192.168.1.2, run this command: $ nc -l -p 1234 -e /bin/sh Then, from any other computer on the same network, one could run this \`nc\` command: $ nc 192.168.1.2 1234 ls -la total 4288 drwxr-xr-x 15 dummy users 4096 2009-02-17 07:47 . drwxr-xr-x 4 dummy users 4096 2009-01-18 21:22 .. -rw- 1 dummy users 8192 2009-02-16 19:30 .bash_history -rw-rr 1 dummy users 220 2009-01-18 21:04 .bash_logout ... In this way, the \`-e\` option can be used to create a rudimentary backdoor. Some administrators perceive this as a risk and thus do not allow \`netcat\` on a computer. ncat Ncat is a similar tool to netcat provided by Nmap suite. \\"While Ncat isn't built on any code from the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù Netcat (or any other implementation), Ncat is most definitely based on Netcat in spirit and functionality.\\" Ncat features includes: ability to chain Ncats together, redirect both TCP and UDP ports to other sites, SSL support, and proxy connections via SOCKS4 or HTTP (CONNECT method) proxies (with optional proxy authentication as well).https://nmap.org/ncat/ * Connect to example.org on TCP port 8080. : \`ncat example.org 8080\` * Listen for connections on TCP port 8080. : \`ncat -l 8080\` * Redirect TCP port 8080 on the local machine to host on port 80. : \`ncat sh-exec \\"ncat example.org 80\\" -l 8080 keep-open\` * Bind to TCP port 8081 and attach /bin/bash for the world to access freely. : \`ncat exec \\"/bin/bash\\" -l 8081 keep-open\` * Bind a shell to TCP port 8081, limit access to hosts on a local network, and limit the maximum number of simultaneous connections to 3: \`ncat exec \\"/bin/bash\\" max-conns 3 allow 192.168.0.0/24 -l 8081 keep-open\` * Connect to smtphost:25 through a SOCKS4 server on port 1080: \`ncat proxy socks4host proxy-type socks4 proxy-auth user smtphost 25\` * Create an HTTP proxy server on localhost port 8888. : \`ncat -l proxy-type http localhost 8888\` * Send a file over TCP port 9899 from host2 (client) to host1 (server). user@HOST1$ ncat -l 9899 > outputfile user@HOST2$ ncat HOST1 9899 < inputfile * Transfer in the other direction, turning Ncat into a ‚Äúone file‚Äù server. user@HOST1$ ncat -l 9899 < inputfile user@HOST2$ ncat HOST1 9899 > outputfile =Encrypted file transfer= Suppose you have an SSH tunnel, and you want to copy a file to the remote machine. You could just \`scp\` it directly, but that opens up another connection. The goal is to re-use the existing connection. You can use netcat to do this: When you SSH in, add in \`-L 31000:127.0.0.1:31000\` (this is port forwarding, sending everything from port 31000 on the remote machine to the same port on the local machine) * On the remote: \`ncat -lvnp 31000 127.0.0.1 > file\` * On the local: \`ncat -v -w 2 127.0.0.1 31000 < file\` No extra overhead. TCP takes care of error correction. SSH has already encrypted the pipe. Ports and reimplementations The original version of netcat was a Unix program. The last version (1.10) was released in March 1996. There are several implementations on POSIX systems, including rewrites from scratch like GNU netcat or OpenBSD netcat, the latter of which supports IPv6 and TLS. The OpenBSD version has been ported to the FreeBSD base and Windows/Cygwin. Mac OS X comes with netcat installed as of OSX 10.13 or users can use MacPorts to install a variant. A DOS version of netcat called NTOOL is included in the FreeDOS Package group Networking. It is based on the WatTCP stack and licensed under the European Union Public Licence Version 1.1. Known ports for embedded systems includes versions for Windows CE (named \\"Netcat 4 wince\\") or for the iPhone. BusyBox includes by default a lightweight version of netcat. Solaris 11 includes netcat implementation based on OpenBSD netcat. Socat is a more complex variant of netcat. It is larger and more flexible and has more options that must be configured for a given task. On February 1, 2016, Santiago Zanella-Beguelin and Microsoft Vulnerability Research issued a security advisory regarding a composite Diffie-Hellman parameter which had been hard-coded into the OpenSSL implementation of socat. The implausibility that a composite might have been unintentionally introduced where a prime number is required has led to the suspicion of sabotage to introduce a backdoor software vulnerability. This socat bug affected version 1.7.3.0 and 2.0.0-b8 it was corrected in following releases from 1.7.3.1 and 2.0.0-b9. Cryptcat is a version of netcat with integrated transport encryption capabilities. In the middle of 2005, Nmap announced another netcat incarnation called Ncat. It features new possibilities such as \\"Connection Brokering\\", TCP/UDP Redirection, SOCKS4 client and server support, ability to \\"Chain\\" Ncat processes, HTTP CONNECT proxying (and proxy chaining), SSL connect/listen support and IP address/connection filtering. Like Nmap, Ncat is cross- platform. On some systems, modified versions or similar netcat utilities go by the command name(s) \`nc\`, \`ncat\`, \`pnetcat\`, \`socat\`, \`sock\`, \`socket\`, \`sbd\`.

Cornish Language Partnership. is a former mining village in south Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It lies mainly in the parish of St Mewan and partly in the parish of St Ewe. The nearest town is St Austell two miles (3.5 km) to the north-east. \\"The greatest tin mine in the world\\" Antiquarians once claimed that the mines of Polgooth had supplied Phoenician traders with tin 3000 years ago,Journal of the Society of Arts Vol 1, p.550 (1853) but in fact the earliest historical record is a list compiled in 1593, in which several well-established Polgooth workings were named. At that time and subsequently, the mines were owned by the Edgcumbe family.http://www.historic- cornwall.org.uk/cisi/polgooth/polgooth.htm By the eighteenth century, Polgooth was celebrated as the \\"greatest tin mine in the world\\"The Monthly Magazine, 16 p.265 (1803) and the richest mine in the United Kingdom. To pump water from the workings an early 50-inch Newcomen steam engine was erected in 1727 by Joseph Hornblower, superseded in 1784 by a 58-inch Boulton & Watt steam engineS. Smiles, Lives of Boulton & Watt, pp71 & 339 (1865) and in 1823 (when John Taylor was manager) by an 80-inch William Sims engine. In 1822, Polgooth was the birthplace of geologist John Arthur Phillips. In the late eighteenth century shareholders or 'adventurers' in the mines included the engineers James Watt (who may have lived in Polgooth for a time) and Matthew Boulton, the industrialist John Wilkinson, local entrepreneur Charles Rashleigh (who built the port of Charlestown, from which much of the tin was shipped), landowner Lord Henry Arundell, and the potters Josiah and John Wedgwood.J. Lord, Capital and steam-power, p.118 (1923)Eliza Meteyard, The Life of Josiah Wedgwood, p. 479 (1866). By 1800, over 1000 people were employed at Polgooth though, judging by a contemporary visitor, not in the most cheerful of conditions: \\"The shafts...are scattered over a considerable extent of sterile ground, whose dreary appearance, and the sallow countenances of the miners, concur to excite ideas of gloom, apprehension, and melancholy.\\"J. Britton et al., The beauties of England and Wales, p.425 (1809) South Polgooth Mine, engine house In the nineteenth century, disputes and periodic slumps in tin prices led to several cycles of closures and reopenings. In 1836, a new mine known as South Polgooth opened to the west of the village, producing not only tin, but copper, wolfram, arsenic, and zinc. However, falling prices meant that by 1894 mining at Polgooth came to an end, though some little work continued at South Polgooth till 1916 and the spoil heaps were picked over till 1929. \\"Enlivened by humble cottages\\" The village of Polgooth grew up amongst the mines. In 1824, a travel guide noted that \\"The whole surface of the country in [this] vicinity, has been completely disfigured, and presents a very gloomy aspect...The immense piles of earth, which have been excavated and thrown up, have quite a mountainous appearance: roads have been formed in several directions leading to the places or shafts, where the miners are at work; and the dreariness of the scene is only enlivened by the humble cottages, which have been erected for their residence.\\"F.W.L. Stockdale, Excursions in the county of Cornwall, p.135 (1824) Many of these cottages were originally grouped in small settlements in and around the mines. These only coalesced into a single village in the nineteenth century, when most of the mine workings had moved onto the surrounding hillsides. Following the end of mining, Polgooth's population dropped sharply and the village became a mainly agricultural, rural settlement. More recently, from the 1960s onwards, large numbers of bungalows and suburban houses have been built, thanks to the proximity of St Austell, Truro, and the south Cornish coast. Religious radicals Tregongeeves Farm on the northern edge of the village was home to Loveday Hambly, (1604‚Äì1682), who was later dubbed \\"the Quaker saint of Cornwall\\".L.V. Hodgkin, The Quaker saint of Cornwall (1927) George Fox, founder of the Religious Society of Friends, stayed at the farm in 1656, 1663, and 1668 when meetings of Cornish Quakers (much persecuted at the time) were held there. The Quaker Burial Ground nearby was donated for that purpose in 1706 by Richard Edgcumbe, 1st Baron Edgcumbe to the Quaker Thomas Lower (brother of the physician Richard Lower),http://www.swquakers.org.uk/?q=node/42 though much of the ground was destroyed by road-widening in the 1960s. Tregongeeves farmhouse was rebuilt in the nineteenth century and the farm buildings have now been converted to 'holiday cottages'. John Wesley, founder of Methodism, preached at Polgooth in 1755. A Wesleyan Meeting House was subsequently built in the village and later enlarged as a Methodist chapel. The latter has now been demolished, but a former Sunday School has been converted in its stead. The village today Many of the older buildings in the village were built from elvan stone, quarried locally until the 1920s. The Polgooth Inn dates back to the sixteenth century and is still extant, though the present building is mainly nineteenth century.http://www.staustellbrewery.co.uk/pubs/a-z-of-pubs/224-polgooth-inn- polgooth.html accessdate=2011-02-07 The old count house survives, as does one of the old engine houses and a stamping mill (all now converted to private residences) plus several mining cottages. In 2000 the prime minister Tony Blair visited Polgooth Post Office for a photo opportunity, to the bemusement of several residents.

Volcanic activity on the island includes lava lakes in two craters near the summit. Etymology Ambrym (aka Ambrin, \\"ham rim\\" in the Ranon language) was allegedly named by Captain Cook, who is said to have anchored off there in 1774. In fact, his expedition never touched Ambrym. Geography Located near the center of the long Vanuatuan archipelago, Ambrym is roughly triangular in shape, about wide. With of surface area, it is the fifth largest island in the country. The summit at the centre of the island is dominated by a desert-like caldera, which covers an area of . With the exception of human settlements, the rest of the island is covered by a dense jungle. Volcanology Ambrym is a large basaltic volcano with a 12-km-wide caldera, and one of the most active volcanoes of the New Hebrides volcanic arc. Ash plume from Ambrym Volcano, October 4, 2004 The caldera is the result of a huge Plinian eruption, which took place around AD 50. Its explosive force is rated 6, the third highest in the Smithsonian Institution's Volcanic Explosivity Index ranks of the largest volcanic explosions in recent geological history. While at higher elevations cinder cones predominate, the western tip of the island is characterized by a series of basaltic tuff rings, of which the largest is about in diameter. These were produced by phreatic eruptions when magma contacted the water table and water-saturated sediments along the coast. The massive, 1900-year-old, √ó caldera is the site of two active volcanic cones, Benbow and Marum (also spelled Maroum). Mount Benbow was named by Captain Cook after English Admiral John Benbow (1653‚Äì1702), whom Cook admired. Several times a century, Ambrym volcano has destructive eruptions. Mount Benbow last erupted in 1913, causing the evacuation of the population to Mele, near Port Vila on Efate. Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System, which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity. In March 2017, Google added the Marum crater with its lava lakes to Google Streetview. Since the last fissure eruption on 16 Dec 2018, the lake of molten lava, for which Mount Marum and Mount Benbow have been famous, has disappeared.https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=257040 Demographics With the neighbor island of Malakula and a few smaller islands, Ambrym forms Malampa Province.

Since 2017, Jones has also served as a county councillor for the Wyesham ward in Monmouthshire County Council. Background The daughter of a farmer and a lecturer, Jones was born in Newport and brought up in Monmouthshire. She attended the University of Plymouth, where she studied politics. Political career She joined the Conservatives in 1996 and was involved in Conservative Future, the party's youth wing. Elected to the Assembly at the 2003 election to represent South Wales East, she was the youngest member of the Assembly. She was appointed as the Conservative spokeswoman on sport, and sat on the Culture, Sport and Welsh Language, and Local Government and Public Services committees. Her profile was increased when she appeared on the BBC television programme Question Time in February 2004. Jones lost her seat in the Assembly in the 2007 Assembly election when Plaid Cymru gained one seat in the South Wales East region at the expense of the Conservatives. At the 2015 general election she contested the safe Labour seat of Islwyn for the Conservatives and finished third with 5,366 votes. In the 2017 Welsh local elections she was elected to the Wyesham ward on Monmouthshire County Council winning 42% of the vote. At the 2019 general election she contested the Labour seat of Blaenau Gwent for the Conservatives and finished third with 5,749 votes. Following the death of Mohammad Asghar in June 2020, it was confirmed in July 2020 that Jones would become the MS for South Wales East, having been the next Conservative candidate on the regional list in the Assembly's 2016 election.

In contrast, SPECT and positron emission tomography (PET) form 3-dimensional images, and are therefore classified as separate techniques to scintigraphy, although they also use gamma cameras to detect internal radiation. Scintigraphy is unlike a diagnostic X-ray where external radiation is passed through the body to form an image. Process Computer representation of false-color image of a cross section of human brain, based on scintillography in Positron-Emission Tomography Scintillography is an imaging method of nuclear events provoked by collisions or charged current interactions among nuclear particles or ionizing radiation and atoms which result in a brief, localised pulse of electromagnetic radiation, usually in the visible light range (Cherenkov radiation). This pulse (scintillation) is usually detected and amplified by a photomultiplier or charged coupled device elements, and its resulting electrical waveform is processed by computers to provide two- and three-dimensional images of a subject or region of interest. Schematic of a photomultiplier tube coupled to a scintillator. Cross section of a gamma camera. Scintillography is mainly used in scintillation cameras in experimental physics. For example, huge neutrino detection underground tanks filled with tetrachloroethylene are surrounded by arrays of photo detectors in order to capture the extremely rare event of a collision between the fluid's atoms and a neutrino. Another extensive use of scintillography is in medical imaging techniques which use gamma ray detectors called gamma cameras. Detectors coated with materials which scintillate when subjected to gamma rays are scanned with optical photon detectors and scintillation counters. The subjects are injected with special radionuclides which irradiate in the gamma range inside the region of interest, such as the heart or the brain. A special type of gamma camera is the SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography). Another medical scintillography technique, the Positron-emission tomography (PET), which uses the scintillations provoked by electron-positron annihilation phenomena. By organ or organ system =Biliary system (cholescintigraphy)= Scintigraphy of the biliary system is called cholescintigraphy and is done to diagnose obstruction of the bile ducts by a gallstone (cholelithiasis), a tumor, or another cause. It can also diagnose gallbladder diseases, e.g. bile leaks of biliary fistulas. In cholescintigraphy, the injected radioactive chemical is taken up by the liver and secreted into the bile. The radiopharmaceutical then goes into the bile ducts, the gallbladder, and the intestines. The gamma camera is placed on the abdomen to picture these perfused organs. Other scintigraphic tests are done similarly. =Lung scintigraphy= Lung scintigraphy evaluating lung cancer The most common indication for lung scintigraphy is to diagnose pulmonary embolism, e.g. with a ventilation/perfusion scan and may be appropriate for excluding PE in pregnancy. Less common indications include evaluation of lung transplantation, preoperative evaluation, evaluation of right-to-left shunts. In the ventilation phase of a ventilation/perfusion scan, a gaseous radionuclide xenon or technetium DTPA in an aerosol form (or ideally using Technegas, a radioaerosol invented in Australia by Dr Bill Burch and Dr Richard Fawdry) is inhaled by the patient through a mouthpiece or mask that covers the nose and mouth. The perfusion phase of the test involves the intravenous injection of radioactive technetium macro aggregated albumin (Tc99m-MAA). A gamma camera acquires the images for both phases of the study. =Bone= For example, the ligand methylene-diphosphonate (MDP) can be preferentially taken up by bone. By chemically attaching technetium-99m to MDP, radioactivity can be transported and attached to bone via the hydroxyapatite for imaging. Any increased physiological function, such as a fracture in the bone, will usually mean increased concentration of the tracer. =Heart= A thallium stress test is a form of scintigraphy, where the amount of thallium-201 detected in cardiac tissues correlates with tissue blood supply. Viable cardiac cells have normal Na+/K+ ion exchange pumps. Thallium binds the K+ pumps and is transported into the cells. Exercise or dipyridamole induces widening (vasodilation) of normal coronary arteries. This produces coronary steal from areas of ischemia where arteries are already maximally dilated. Areas of infarct or ischemic tissue will remain \\"cold\\". Pre- and post-stress thallium may indicate areas that will benefit from myocardial revascularization. Redistribution indicates the existence of coronary steal and the presence of ischemic coronary artery disease. =Parathyroid= Tc99m-sestamibi is used to detect parathyroid adenomas. =Thyroid= To detect metastases/function of thyroid, the isotopes technetium-99m or iodine-123 are generally used, and for this purpose the iodide isotope does not need to be attached to another protein or molecule, because thyroid tissue takes up free iodide actively. =Renal and urinary systems= =Full body= Examples are gallium scans, indium white blood cell scans, iobenguane scan (MIBG) and octreotide scans. The MIBG scan detects adrenergic tissue and thus can be used to identify the location of tumors such as pheochromocytomas and neuroblastomas. Function tests Certain tests, such as the Schilling test and urea breath test, use radioisotopes but are not used to produce a specific image.

It is defined as an antibody against the Fc portion of IgG and different RFs can recognize different parts of the IgG-Fc. RF and IgG join to form immune complexes that contribute to the disease process. Rheumatoid factor can also be a cryoglobulin (antibody that precipitates on cooling of a blood sample); it can be either type 2 (monoclonal IgM to polyclonal IgG) or type 3 (polyclonal IgM to polyclonal IgG) cryoglobulin. Although predominantly encountered as IgM, rheumatoid factor can be of any isotype of immunoglobulins, i.e. IgA, IgG, IgM, IgE, IgD. Testing RF is often evaluated in patients suspected of having any form of arthritis even though positive results can be due to other causes, and negative results do not rule out disease. But, in combination with signs and symptoms, it can play a role in both diagnosis and disease prognosis. It is part of the usual disease criteria of rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of rheumatoid factor in serum can also indicate the occurrence of suspected autoimmune activity unrelated to rheumatoid arthritis, such as that associated with tissue or organ rejection. In such instances, RF may serve as one of several serological markers for autoimmunity. The sensitivity of RF for established rheumatoid arthritis is only 60-70% with a specificity of 78%. Interpretation High levels of rheumatoid factor (in general, above 20 IU/mL, 1:40, or over the 95th percentile; there is some variation among labs) occur in rheumatoid arthritis (present in 80%) and Sj√∂gren's syndrome (present in 70%).Rheumatoid Factor - Patient UK The higher the level of RF the greater the probability of destructive articular disease. It is also found in Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus or Parvovirus infection and in 5 to 10% of healthy persons, especially the elderly. There is an association between rheumatoid factor and more persistently active synovitis, more joint damage, greater eventual disability and arthritis.http://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_factor/article.htmThe Arthritis Association, Report by MHC 19.2 Other than in rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid factor may also be elevated in: * Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) *Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis * Sj√∂gren syndrome * Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis * Hepatitis B, chronic liver disease, and chronic hepatitis * Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia * Primary biliary cirrhosis * Infectious mononucleosis and any chronic viral infection * Bacterial endocarditis * Leprosy * Sarcoidosis * Tuberculosis * Syphilis * Visceral leishmaniasis * Malaria * Leukemia * Dermatomyositis * Systemic sclerosis * After vaccination/transfusion in normal individuals History The test was first described by Norwegian Dr Erik Waaler in 1940 and redescribed by Dr Harry M.

It is the ancestral home of the Clan Murray, and was historically the seat of their chief, the Duke of Atholl, though the current (12th) Duke, Bruce Murray, lives in South Africa. The castle stands in Glen Garry, and commands a strategic position on the main route (now the A9 road) through the central Scottish Highlands. The castle is a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History Murray Heraldry. Blair Castle is said to have been started in 1269 by John I Comyn, Lord of Badenoch (died c. 1275), a northern neighbour of David I Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl (died 1270), who started building on the Earl's land while he was away on crusade. Upon his return, the Earl complained about the interloper to King Alexander III, won back his land, and incorporated the tower that had been built into his own castle. David II Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl (died 1326), forfeited the titles and estates after rebelling against King Robert the Bruce in 1308, and the King granted them to Niall mac Cailein. The earldom was granted to a number of individuals over the years until 1457 when James II granted it to his half- brother John Stewart (1440‚Äì1512). John Murray, son of the second Earl of Tullibardine, was created Earl of Atholl in 1629, and the title has since remained in the Murray family. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms of the 17th century, the Murrays supported the Royalist cause, which led to Blair Castle being taken by Oliver Cromwell's army following his invasion of 1650. The restored Charles II created the title Marquess of Atholl for John Murray, 2nd Earl of Atholl (1631‚Äì1703). The title Duke of Atholl was granted to the 2nd Marquess in 1703. When Viscount Dundee launched the first Jacobite rising in April 1689, Atholl decided to remain loyal to the Government (although two of his sons joined the Jacobites). Atholl's factor, Patrick Stewart of Ballechin, held Blair Castle for King James, and Dundee visited in May. In July Ballechin refused entry to Atholl's whiggish son and heir, Lord John Murray. Murray laid siege to the castle, and General Mackay was approaching to join him and to seize it for the Williamites. Viscount Dundee relieved the castle, and the crucial Battle of Killiecrankie was fought because Dundee did not want to retreat and surrender the castle to Mackay. Dundee and his officers and clan chiefs held a Council of War at the castle on the eve of the battle, on 26 July. The next day, the Jacobites won the battle but Dundee was killed. After the battle, Blair Castle remained in Jacobite hands for some time. It continued to play an important role: for example, the Jacobite Highland chiefs swore a bond there together in August, to continue the rising. In the Forty-Five, Blair Castle was occupied twice by Prince Charles Edward Stuart and his Jacobite army: in early September 1745, for several days, and then in early February 1746, again for several days. However, the Jacobites then unwisely abandoned it and Government forces, including Lowland Clan Agnew then occupied it. They held Blair Castle against the Jacobites, who laid siege to the castle during the last stages of the rising, in March 1746 they were besieged to near starvation until the Jacobite forces withdrew to fight the British Government forces at the Battle of Culloden. In 1844 Queen Victoria and her consort, Prince Albert visited and stayed at Blair Castle. It was after this she gave permission to establish the Atholl Highlanders. Before his death in 1996, Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl, placed Blair Castle and most of his estates in a charitable trust, shielding them from inheritance taxes and leaving them under Scottish control, as his heir John Murray, the 11th Duke had indicated he had no desire to leave his native South Africa. On the night of 10 March 2011 a fire broke out at the clock tower of castle (not part of the medieval fabric), causing the tower's roof and second floor to collapse into the first floor. The clock tower was restored in 2012, with restoration work on the clock mechanisms performed by Smith of Derby Group. The castle and gardens The oldest part of the castle is the six-storey Cummings or Comyn's Tower, which may retain some 13th-century fabric, though it was largely built in the 15th century. The extensions which now form the central part of the castle were first added in the 16th century. The apartments to the south were added in the mid-18th century to designs by architects John Douglas and James Winter. The south-east range, incorporating the clock tower, was rebuilt by Archibald Elliot after a fire in 1814. Finally, the castle arrived at its present form in the 1870s, when David Bryce remodelled the whole building in a Scots Baronial style, and added the ballroom. It was further remodelled in 1885 when a new ballroom wing was added by James Campbell Walker.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Walker The castle has been open to the public since 1936. Its many rooms feature important collections of weapons, hunting trophies, souvenirs of the Murray clan, ethnographica, paintings, furniture, and needlework collected by the Murray family over many generations. The castle also provides the garrison for the Atholl Highlanders, the private army of the Duke of Atholl, noted as the only legal private army in Europe. The Castle and the Atholl Estates were used in the 2008 reality television series Conquer the Castle. Most Dukes of Atholl are buried in the Family Burial Ground (photo) next to the ruins of St Bride's Kirk in the grounds of Blair Castle. St Bride's was the village church of Old Blair but fell into disuse after 1823 when the estate village was relocated to its current location.A history and description of St Bride's Kirk, Old Blair, accessed 5 December 2018 In 2009, a Grand Fir (Abies grandis) in Diana's Grove in the grounds of the castle, was measured at , and declared the second- tallest tree in Britain.

The company was the first to mass-produce model rocket engines with consistent and reliable performance. History Estes Industries was founded by Vernon Estes in 1958; in 1961, the company moved to a 77-acre tract of land on the outskirts of Penrose, Colorado. Rapid growth followed and soon Penrose became known as the \\"Model Rocket Capital of the World\\". In 1969, Vernon sold the company to the Damon Corporation of Needham, a company which also purchased a number of other hobby companies including a smaller competitor of Estes, Centuri Engineering of Phoenix, Arizona. Damon merged the two companies under the name Centuri Engineering. The Penrose entity continued doing business as Estes Industries. Centuri Engineering model rocket products continued to be developed, marketed and sold from the Centuri offices in Phoenix as well, although the actual manufacturing of Centuri products was soon moved to the Estes facility in Penrose. Sales of Centuri model rocket products were never as successful as Estes brand products and the Centuri Engineering offices in Phoenix were finally closed and the Centuri product line was discontinued in 1983. Following a hostile takeover of the Damon Corporation in 1989, Estes Industries was divested and became part of Hobby Products. The business name of the company was shortened to Centuri Corporation. In 1996, Hobby Products acquired the assets of Cox Products of Corona, California, a company involved with the design and manufacture of model airplanes and glow-fuel model airplane engines. Cox's assets were moved to the Estes facility. In 2002, the combined company was sold again and the company's name was changed to Estes-Cox Corp. On August 30, 2002, Barry Tunick, who had been the Chief Executive Officer since 1991, acquired Estes- Cox Corporation from the private equity fund, TCW Capital, for the sum of $15 million. On January 15, 2010, Estes-Cox was acquired by Hobbico, Inc.\\"Hobbico acquires model rocket maker Estes-Cox\\" Champaign-Urbana News Gazette - January 2010 On January 10, 2018, Hobbico filed for bankruptcy protection under the auspices of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.\\"Hobbico files for bankruptcy; layoffs next?\\" As a result of the bankruptcy, Estes-Cox was sold to Estes Industries LLC on April 12, 2018.  Accomplishments  = Mabel = Vern Estes created \\"Mabel\\". \\"Mabel\\" was a machine designed to safely and inexpensively manufacture model rocket engines for Model Missiles Incorporated. Mabel was capable of producing a completed model rocket engine every 5-1/2 seconds. The operation began with an engine casing tube being loaded onto a rotating table. The table then advances through multiple stations where the nozzle, propellant, delay and ejection components are added. A paper end cap is then cut from a roll of heavy paper tape and inserted to retain the loose ejection charge. The completed engine is then ejected from the table, sent through the printer and dropped into the finished engine box below. = Indoor launch of model rockets in Astrodome= Along with several smaller rockets, Estes sponsored an indoor launch of a model of a Saturn V at halftime of the BluebonnetBowl in the Houston Astrodome on December 31, 1969  Estes rockets  Five rockets from Estes in 1969: the Alpha, Saturn V (Semi Scale), X-ray, Aerobee 300, and Astron Ranger Estes produced a wide variety of rocket model kits, normally using paperboard tubing for the fuselage and balsa wood for fins and nose cones. Early models tended to be relatively simple in design terms, differing in terms of size, number of stages and recovery method. One particularly well known design from this era was the Camroc, a small camera that replaced the nose cone of larger models that was designed to take a single image on a small disk of film when the motor had burned out and the rocket was facing downward. The Cineroc used a small movie camera that could be launched from larger rockets, taking a series of frames as the rocket ascended. Later model kits from the late 1970s and early 1980s tended to be more for show than performance, including a series of scale or sport-scale designs and \\"exotics\\". Centuri was also well known for these sorts of designs, and the two companies often copied design elements from the other's latest models. The downturn in the hobby in the later 1980s led to consolidation of the two companies. During the 1990s the model line was dramatically reduced, and the ones that were left were typically very simple \\"three fins and a nose cone\\" designs that were partially or entirely preassembled. = Estes rocket engine color-coding = Estes Rocket motors. From left, 13mm A10-0T, 18mm C6-7, 24mm D12-5, 24mm E9-4 Estes engines are color-coded for recommended use. * Green engines are for use in single-stage models. * Purple engines for the top stages of multistage rockets and very light single-stage rockets. * Red engines for all booster and intermediate states of multi-stage models. * Blue engines are \\"plugged\\" and are used for rocket-powered racers, aerobrake recovery rockets, and radio controlled gliders; they contain no delay or ejection charge. * Black has been used in the past for static test engines, which were also plugged to prevent blow- through. It can be dangerous to use upper-stage engines in normal single-stage rockets. The long delay in ejection can be problematic. The rocket may already be halfway through its descent when the parachute or streamer is ejected, and the rocket may not slow down enough before it hits the ground. = Estes number coding = Each rocket engine has a code printed upon the outer jacket. This code is defined by the National Association of Rocketry (NAR). An example of one such code is A8-3. {class = \\"wikitable\\" style = \\"float:right; font- size:85%; margin-left:15px\\" !Type ! Total Impulse (Newton seconds) - !¬ºA align=\\"center\\"0.31‚Äì0.62 - !¬ΩA align=\\"center\\"0.63‚Äì1.25 - !A align=\\"center\\"1.26‚Äì2.50 - !B align=\\"center\\"2.51‚Äì5.00 - !C align=\\"center\\"5.01‚Äì10.00 - !D align=\\"center\\"10.01‚Äì20.00 - !E align=\\"center\\"20.01‚Äì40.00 - !F align=\\"center\\"40.01‚Äì80.00 } The capital letter (e.g., A) indicates total impulse produced by the engine. Each succeeding letter represents a power range with maximum total impulse twice the impulse of the previous letter. (Example: A single C engine can produce anywhere from 5.01 to 10 newton-seconds of impulse, a G engine 80.1 to 160 newton-seconds.) Anything over a G engine is considered high power model rocketry. The first number (e.g., 8) specifies that engine's average thrust in newtons or the average push exerted by the engine. Thus a B6-0 and a C6-0 will both produce the same average thrust of 6 newtons, but the C6-0, having twice the total impulse, will fire for twice as long. The rocket engines produce maximum thrust shortly after ignition and thrust declines to a steady-state which is maintained for up to 2.5 seconds prior to burnout. The final number (e.g., 3) indicates the delay between the thrust and the ejection charge, in seconds. Engines with a delay of zero are typically used as booster engines in multi-stage rockets and there is no ejection charge. In this case, the burning propellant ruptures through the top and hot bits of propellant enter the nozzle of the upper stage engine, thus igniting that engine and forcing the booster assembly away, hopefully to tumble safely to earth. = Estes engine construction = The engines are constructed within a sturdy cardboard tube. Inside are placed a ceramic nozzle, solid propellant, delay charge, ejection charge, and a clay retainer cap. The solid propellant is ignited by a coated wire inserted through the nozzle and in contact with the propellant. An electric current heats the wire and ignites the solid propellant. An engine can also be ignited by the hot gases from the propellant of a booster engine. Reception Estes model rockets are popular and used by a large number of hobbyists and educators. However, measurements reported by a group at the University of Central Arkansas found that Estes rocket motor models A3-4T, A8-3, B4-4, B6-4, C6-5, and D12-3 have a measured impulses from 15.4% to 22.8% below the claimed impulse.Penn, Kim and William V.

A research product conducted in 1990 by current Estes Industries, LLC President Ellis Langford investigated the performance of black powder model rocket motors at higher altitudes. Effect of Altitude on Rocket Engine Performance Langford's findings indicate that total impulse and average thrust increase significantly with increased elevation. Estes Industries claimed specifications are based on testing at the Penrose manufacturing plant at an altitude of approximately 5000 feet, versus the three studies and National Association of Rocketry certification tests, all of which were performed at altitudes much nearer sea level.

It is, however, not resolvable into individual stars even with larger amateur telescopes.  Distance Previously thought to belong to the Milky Way at a distance from Earth of about 50,000 light-years, it was discovered in 1994 that M54 most likely belongs to the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy (SagDEG), making it the first globular cluster formerly thought to be part of our galaxy reassigned to extragalactic status, even if not recognized as such for nearly two and a quarter centuries. As it is located on SagDEG's center, some authors think it actually may be its core; however others have proposed that it is a real globular cluster that fell to the center of this galaxy due to decay of its orbit caused by dynamical friction. Modern estimates now place M54 at a distance of some 87,000 light-years, translating into a true radius of 150 light-years across.

The band's music has evolved from fast-paced indie rock in the vein of their most obvious influences The Fall, Buzzcocks and Gang of Four to more varied forms. Throughout their career, they have been led by vocalist and guitarist David Gedge, the band's only constant member. History =Early stages and the Reception era (1985-1989)= The band has its origins in the Lost Pandas, which folded in 1984 when Janet Rigby, the drummer for the band, left following departure of guitarist Michael Duane. David Gedge and The Lost Pandas' bass player, Keith Gregory, decided to continue the band, renaming it The Wedding Present. The name was jointly conceived by Gedge and his girlfriend at the time, as they were both avid fans of The Birthday Party and it was an homage to their favourite band. Gedge and Gregory recruited an old schoolmate of Gedge's, Peter Solowka, to play guitar and auditioned a string of drummers, including John Ramsden, and Mike Bedford, with whom they recorded a demo tape, before settling on Shaun Charman. The country's clubs and bars were toured as the band prepared for the recording of their first, self- financed single. \\"Go Out and Get ‚ÄôEm, Boy!\\" was chosen over early favourite \\"Will You Be Up There?\\" Charman felt somewhat insecure about his drumming abilities and so the A-side features drumming by hired hand Julian Sowa (Charman does, however, play drums on its B-side). The single was released on the band's own Reception Records label with distribution through Red Rhino. Two more singles followed that did well on the independent charts helped by veteran BBC radio DJ John Peel who was one of their first champions. He invited them to do a radio session (three songs from the session are included on the 1988 compilation Tommy 1985-1987; the entire session had already been released as an EP in 1986), starting a long collaboration. By the time the band started work on their debut album, a number of independent and major record companies showed interest, but the band declined all offers and decided to keep releasing their material themselves. The album was released in 1987 and titled George Best after the well-known Northern Irish football player. It was produced by the band and Chris Allison. Upon its release, the album was critically acclaimed and the band were soon classified, with some of their peers, as members of the 'shambling' or C86 scene, a categorisation that they vehemently declined (although they were featured on the original C86 compilation). Musically, the album featured fast-paced rhythm guitar; lyrically, apart from a few excursions into social critique (\\"All This and More\\") and politics (\\"All About Eve\\"), Gedge's main concerns (which would become his trademark) were love, lust, heartbreak and revenge. Soon after the release of George Best, the early singles and radio sessions were compiled and released as Tommy (1985-1987). When Solowka, who has Ukrainian roots, started fooling around with a Ukrainian folk tune during one of their Peel sessions, the idea arose to devote some of their radio time to recording their versions of Ukrainian folk songs, encouraged by Peel. To this end, two guest musicians were invited, singer/violin player Len Liggins and mandolin player Roman Remeynes, and three Peel sessions were recorded with Gedge temporarily limiting himself to playing rhythm guitar and arranging the songs. Between the recording of the first and the second 'Ukrainian' session, Charman was fired from the band. His replacement was Simon Smith, who remained the band's drummer until 1997 and for a long time was, next to Gedge, the only other stable factor in the shifting line-ups. The band planned on releasing eight cuts from the Ukrainian sessions on a 10\\" LP and an initial batch was pressed when Red Rhino went into receivership. Rather than trying to find a new distribution company, the band decided to fold their Reception label altogether and sign with a regular record company: RCA. =The RCA era (1989-1993)= Although the band were criticized by some quarters for 'selling out', under the terms of their contract they were allowed their own choice of producer and singles. They also had the option of releasing any singles rejected by the label independently without breach of contract. The band's new record company bought the initial Reception stock of the Ukrainian record from the band, pressed another batch, and released the record in April 1989 under the name of –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫—ñ –í–∏—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏ –≤ –Ü–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –ü—ñ–ª–∞ (meaning 'Ukrainian John Peel Sessions'; the Latin transliteration Ukra√Ønski Vistupi v Ivana Peela appeared on the sleeve's spine only). The first proper album that The Wedding Present recorded for their new label was released in the same year 1989 and reunited them with producer Chris Allison. Bizarro‚Äôs lyrical themes were largely the same as before and the songs featured the same three-chord structures, but its production values had increased due to a larger recording budget. The album was recorded at Jacobs Studios by Steve Lyon and mixed by him and Chris Allison. The album's companion single, \\"Kennedy\\", provided the band with their first British Top 40 hit. Seeing that they were growing more popular in the American college radio scene, the band turned towards America for their next project. The band decided to re-record Bizarro track \\"Brassneck\\" with the former Big Black frontman Steve Albini. It was the start of a two-year collaboration: the next single, \\"Corduroy\\" and album, Seamonsters, were also recorded by Albini at Pachyderm Recording Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. Melody Maker likened listening to the record to sandpapering your ears. End of year readers polls, however, showed the opening track and lead single of the album, \\"Dalliance\\", amongst the top of the favourites list. Almost directly after recording the album, the band announced that they had sacked Solowka. His replacement was Paul Dorrington of local band, Tse Tse Fly (also formerly of A.C. Temple). Solowka teamed up again with Liggins and Remeynes to form The Ukrainians, and continued to blend post-punk with traditional Ukrainian music. The next year saw the band release twelve 7\\" singles in one year. Each single had a limited pressing of 10,000 copies which all reached the Top 30 in the UK Singles Chart, equalling Elvis Presley's record for the most UK Top 30 hits in one year. To economise on songwriting, the B-sides consisted of cover versions of songs including Julee Cruise's \\"Falling\\" (the theme tune from Twin Peaks). The singles and their B-sides, produced by various producers such as Ian Broudie (Lightning Seeds) and Jimmy Miller (The Rolling Stones) were collected on two albums, Hit Parade 1 and Hit Parade 2. Seamonsters, Hit Parade 1 and Hit Parade 2 were released in the United States in 1991 and 1992 by New York- based pseudo-indie label First Warning Records. Shortly after the 1992 singles scheme had ended, the band announced they were leaving RCA. =The Island era (1994-1995)= The band spent most of 1993 taking time off, occasionally playing gigs. A stopgap compilation of three more archive radio sessions, Peel Sessions 1987-1990, was released by Strange Fruit. When they re-emerged in early 1994 with the news that they had signed to Island Records, it was quickly followed by the announcement that Gregory had left the band, due to lack of enthusiasm, and was replaced by Darren Belk. For their next album, The Wedding Present again left for the United States and enlisted Steve Fisk (Screaming Trees, Nirvana). The result was Watusi. The album's songs ranged from warm lo-fi pop (\\"Gazebo\\", \\"Big Rat\\") to semi-psychedelic, Velvets-like workouts (\\"Click Click\\", \\"Catwoman\\"). No further albums were recorded for Island, and the best part of 1995 was spent the same way as 1993: touring, writing new material, no recording. Paul Dorrington decided to quit the band; no replacement was made as Belk doubled on bass and guitar. In the autumn of 1995, The Wedding Present released \\"Sucker\\", a self-financed single that was sold at their gigs only (it has since been included on compilation albums). Shortly after, the band signed with independent label Cooking Vinyl. =The Cooking Vinyl era (1995-1997/99)= The band, still a three-piece, recorded their newly written material and issued the car-themed six-track mini-album, Mini. Belk played both guitar and bass on the songs but struggled at the lead instrument. Shortly after releasing the album, Jayne Lockey, who had already sung backing vocals on Mini, was announced as the band's new bass player. Belk decided to quit the band and was replaced by Simon Cleave. Both Lockey and Cleave were former members of Tse Tse Fly, along with Paul Dorrington and Mark Goodham. The band still had material from their sabbatical year and went into the studio again to record Saturnalia. This proved to be the last new material by The Wedding Present for a long time. After playing a number of gigs to support the album, the last one in Liverpool on 18 January 1997, the band took a long sabbatical. =Contractual obligations and Cinerama (1997-2004)= To fulfill contractual obligations, two more compilations were released by Cooking Vinyl: another Peel sessions volume, John Peel Sessions 1992-1995 (1998), and Singles 1995-1997 (1999). Additionally, Strange Fruit offered another radio sessions compilation, Evening Sessions 1986-1994 (1997), and the band's American label released Singles 1989-1991 (1999), a 2CD package which added rarities and live tracks. Gedge recorded an album, Va Va Voom, in 1998 under the Cinerama band name with his girlfriend, Sally Murrell, and some session musicians. The project became a full-time band. Following Gedge's split from Murrell in 2003, and with the increasing inclusion on Wedding Present songs in Cinerama's live sets (in previous years Gedge had good- naturedly refused calls from the audience to play Wedding Present songs, frequently replying \\"that's another band\\" or \\"you're at the wrong gig\\" ), Gedge effectively renamed Cinerama in 2004, keeping the line up, reflecting the change in sound over the years to the more familiar territory of The Wedding Present. =Reformation (2004-present)= The Wedding Present in Barcelona in 2010. News came in early September 2004 that Cinerama would be rebranded as The Wedding Present. The line-up was to be the same as the last line-up of Cinerama, which included Simon Cleave. The first new single, \\"Interstate 5\\", was issued on 15 November 2004, to lead off the new album, Take Fountain, which was released on 14 February 2005. A second single, \\"I'm From Further North Than You\\", was released on 11 April 2005. Third and final single \\"Ringway to SeaTac\\" was released on 24 October 2005. All singles, their B-sides and acoustic versions from this period were compiled on the 2006 compilation Search for Paradise: Singles 2004-5. The release came with a bonus DVD compiling the videos for \\"Don't Touch That Dial\\" (a Cinerama single re- recorded for Take Fountain), \\"Interstate 5\\", \\"I'm From Further North Than You\\", \\"Ringway to SeaTac\\" and others. The Wedding Present toured Europe and North America in the Spring of 2005 (with John Maiden on drums) and again in Europe towards the end of 2005 (this time, with Simon Pearson on drums). During Christmas 2006, guitarist Simon Cleave left the group and was replaced by the group's sound engineer Chris McConville - who played on the 2006 tours of North America (with Charlie Layton on drums) and Europe (with Graeme Ramsay on drums). Until 2009 the line-up remained stable with Gedge, De Castro, McConville, and Ramsay co-writing. They recorded 17 songs with Steve Albini in January 2008, some of which have been played live at gigs in recent years. Titles include \\"I've Lost the Monkey\\", \\"Soup\\", \\"Drink You Eat You\\", \\"Model, Actress, Whatever...\\", \\"The Thing I Like Most About Him Is His Girlfriend\\", \\"Twenty Jackies\\", \\"Swingers\\", \\"Peek-a-boo\\", \\"Hulk Loves Betty\\", \\"Boo Boo\\", \\"Palisades\\", \\"Santa Ana Winds\\", \\"Pinch Pull Twist Release\\", \\"The Trouble With Men\\", \\"Don't Take Me Home Until I'm Drunk\\" and \\"Spider-Man in Hollywood\\". The album El Rey was released on 20 May 2008 in North America and 26 May 2008 in Europe, accompanied by the digital download-only single \\"The Thing I Like Best About Him Is His Girlfriend\\". A compilation of singles and remixes How The West Was Won was released towards the end of 2008 and accompanied by a single \\"Holly Jolly Hollywood\\". The Wedding Present also covered The Cure's \\"High\\" for American Laundromat Records tribute \\"Just Like Heaven - a tribute to The Cure\\". Some months before a short tour of the UK and Japan in March 2009, Chris McConville left the band and was replaced by former guitarist Simon Cleave, who left the band again later that year. Graeme Ramsay subsequently moved from drums to guitar and Charles Layton once again became their drummer. In 2009 two The Wedding Present songs, \\"I'm From Further North Than You\\", and \\"Ringway to SeaTac\\" appeared in the award-winning Monty Miranda directed independent film Skills Like This. The director was praised for his use of music in an integrated soundtrack. In August 2010 it was announced that De Castro would not be touring with The Wedding Present for the Autumn 21st anniversary tour of Bizarro, and that her last gig would be at 28 August 2010 at Gedge's mini festival \\"At the Edge of the Sea\\" in Brighton. This marked the end of a 12-year association with Gedge, stretching back to when Cinerama was formed. She was replaced by Pepe le Moko. David Gedge, singer of The Wedding Present in Valencia, Spain. October 2016 A new Wedding Present album, Valentina was released in March 2012. Shortly before its release, guitarist Graeme Ramsay left the band after six years. and was replaced by Patrick Alexander (ex-The Young Playthings and The Pipettes). During 2012, The Wedding Present toured a set which usually featured the whole of Seamonsters, performed live and in album order. The rest of the set was a mixture of songs from Valentina and the back catalogue. In April of the year, The Wedding Present toured Australia for the first time, playing concerts in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne. On 25 October 2012, the 4 Songs Extended Player was released on download only. These four new songs (\\"Journey Into Space\\", \\"Pain Perdu\\", \\"1000 Fahrenheit\\" & \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\") recorded during the Valentina sessions could be downloaded following the purchase of 'Valentina: The Story of a Wedding Present, a book documenting the making of the long player itself. Valentina itself was re-released in May 2015 after being re- interpreted and re-recorded by David Gedge's other band Cinerama. In early 2013 the band started a world tour including taking in the US, Australia and for the first time New Zealand. The Wedding Present played 'George Best' and 'The Hit Parade' in their entirety on this tour celebrating the 25th and 21st 'birthday' of these albums respectively. The band released their ninth album, Going, Going... on 2 September 2016. 2017 saw the 30th anniversary of the release of George Best, an anniversary tour and a feature-length documentary about the record titled The Wedding Present: Something Left Behind. In mid-2019, the band issued a completely re-recorded version of 1988 compilation Tommy, plus their first picture disc - a 10\\" single featuring two new songs. In late 2019, the band toured playing Bizarro in its entirety. During this tour the band were joined on guitar by Jon Stewart of Sleeper and Chris Hardwick from My Life Story on drums.

The district is about west of Ealing Broadway. Although there is a long history of settlement in the area, West Ealing in its present form is less than one hundred years old. West Ealing falls under the postcode district W13 and neighbours Hanwell, Ealing, Perivale and Northfields History =Early History= A hamlet named West Ealing was recorded in 1234 AD, although it was later renamed Ealing Dean; the West Ealing railway station was known as the Castle Hill & Ealing Dean Station when it was built in 1871. Ealing Dean may derive from denu (valley); its first reference was in 1456, and it appears on a 1777 Ealing parish map. Most of what is now West Ealing was open countryside, with houses at Ealing Dean, Drayton Green and Castle Bear Hill (now Castlebar Hill). In 1387 Drayton Green was known as Drayton and, later, as Drayton in Ealing. During the late 19th century, Drayton was a hamlet with eight householders. The area around Drayton Green Lane was later called Steven's Town and had over forty cottages. A major east‚Äìwest road in the area became known as the Uxbridge Road. It was a popular 19th-century stagecoach route, and the London-to-Banbury-and-Oxford coach stopped at the Halfway House pub (the present Broadwalk Hotel) in West Ealing.The original name of Halfway House is still visible in the semicircle above the top floor windows The Green Man pub in West Ealing was a carters' stop, reportedly with stabling for a hundred horses. =19th Century= During the 19th century much of the land from the Uxbridge Road south to Windmill Road, east to Northfield Avenue and west to Boston Road was market gardens and orchards. In addition to a few streets named for apple varieties, among the last remaining evidence of this is the little-changed Steel's Fruit Packing Warehouse at the intersection of Northfield and Northcroft Roads. At the eastern boundary of these market gardens and orchards were allotments dating to the Poor Relief Act of 1832, when the area known as Ealing Dean Common (both sides of Northfield Avenue) was given to West Ealing's poor by the bishop of London. The allotments on the east side of Northfield Avenue are original, but those on the west side were developed in the early 1980s. Ealing Dean's principal claim to fame in the 1800s was its pony and donkey races. These races, on what was known as Jackass Common (the present Dean Gardens), ended in 1880 when the local council forbade them on moral grounds. In 1882, the Ealing Lawn Tennis Club was founded on land between St. Leonards Road and the Great Western Railway (GWR). The club quickly became the most successful women's lawn-tennis club in the world. Three Ealing-born club members (Blanche Bingley, Charlotte Cooper and Dorothea Douglass) won a total of thirteen Wimbledon Singles titles between 1886 and 1906. In 1906, the club moved to Creffield Road in Ealing Common. During the 1890s, central West Ealing's shops were more informal than those in central Ealing. There were then (and now) fruit and vegetable stalls in West Ealing which were absent from Ealing. Central West Ealing throve during the mid-20th century when draper, house furnisher, clothier and outfitters F. H. Rowse and draper and fashion house W. J. Daniel and Company flourished with Marks and Spencer, British Home Stores, Woolworth, Sainsbury's and WHSmith. Later, Waitrose, McDonald's and Blockbuster Video arrived. The West Ealing Library is on Melbourne Avenue south of the Uxbridge Road.It has since been rehoused in a modern building. Storytime is held on Tuesdays from 10.30‚Äì11 am. Events are organised for children throughout the school holidays. Open: Tues, Wed and Thurs 9am‚Äì7.45pm; Friday and Saturday 9am‚Äì5pm; Sun and Mon closed. There is wheelchair access to the library. For more information visit Ealing Council website in External links (below) Its former location, which opened in 1903, was between Melbourne Avenue and St James's Avenue (the present Sainsbury's location).Ealing and Brentford: Public services', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 7: Acton, Chiswick, Ealing and Brentford, West Twyford, Willesden (1982), pp. 147-49,(fn 68). Date accessed: 14 May 2007. =Modern History= West Ealing had a large cinema at the Uxbridge Road end of Northfield Avenue, which opened as the Kinema in 1913 and replaced the Ealing Dean Cottage Hospital. The cinema was rebuilt in 1928 as the Lido. When attendance fell, it was divided into two small cinemas (Studio one and Studio two) and the main hall became a bingo hall. After a change in ownership, the cinemas became Cannon 1 and 2 and the bingo facility reopened as a snooker hall. With another change of ownership it was briefly the Gosai, an Indian cinema primarily devoted to Bollywood films. After it closed, it was demolished in 2005. The site has been redeveloped in a partnership of the Dominion Housing Group and the Ealing Community and Voluntary Service; the new building, the Lido Centre, opened in 2007 as Ealing's volunteer centre. Above the voluntary-organisation work space are a number of small utility flats intended for social housing.Ealing Volunteer Centre. Volunteering England Organisation. Accessed 2007-05-14 West Ealing station in 1978 Residential building growth in the area may be attributed to the 1871 GWR railway station at Ealing Dean and the line's later extension to Greenford via Castle Bar Park railway station and Drayton Green railway station; the 1901 London United Tramways Company line from Ealing to Southall, and the 1907 District Railway halt at Northfields. During the 1920s, a number of houses were built on the Argyle Park estate (from the Argyle Road to the Greenford GWR railway line) and along Kent Avenue. Later housing developments replaced the allotments west of Northfield Avenue; others created flats in Langham Gardens (off Gordon Road) in 1970 and another, in 1977, created the Green Man Lane Estate. In the early 1980s, the Berners Drive-Coleridge Square estate was built next to the rebuilt West Middlesex Lawn Tennis club west of Drayton Green. Since World War II there has been rebuilding in West Ealing, with a number of Victorian houses converted into flats. F. H. Rowse's, WHSmith, Marks and Spencer, Woolworth and McDonald's have left. Recent arrivals include Wilko. The Daniel's store has been replaced by a gym under a block of flats. Waitrose replaced its original store with a larger one. Although West Ealing's shopping and cultural facilities have gradually declined, in 2001 it saw the establishment of London's only street market dedicated to farm produce.Called Ealing Farmer's Market it is part of London Farmers' Markets.

One estate in particular is the Green Man Lane Estate, which was built in the 70's and is situated just north of the High Street. This estate has been knocked down and still is in the process of a regeneration which is to make way for replacement properties for affordable rent, shared ownership and outright sale.https://www.ridge.co.uk/project/green-man-lane-estate-regeneration/ Religion The old St Stephen's Church, West Ealing (now used as flats) There are three Church of England churches in West Ealing. St John's Church is in Mattock Lane, to the southeast; St James's Church is located to the southwest, in St James's Avenue; and St Stephen's Church is located to the north, in St Stephen's Road. St John's Church was built in 1876 by Edwin Henry Horne, burned down in 1920, and was rebuilt and re-opened in 1923. St James's Church was founded in 1900, disused later in the 20th century and \\"re-planted\\" with a new congregation in the late 1980s. St Stephen's Church was founded in 1867 and in 1891 a spire, nearly fifty metres tall, was added which today still dominates the Ealing skyline. Sadly, the old church building suffered from subsidence and by 1979 the building had to be closed and Sunday services held elsewhere. In 1985, the decision was made to sell the church building to a developer for conversion into apartments and build a new church centre on the site of the old Church Hall. This was completed and dedicated in 1987. West Ealing is also home to the West London Islamic Centre (WLIC). The West London Islamic Centre was established in 1984 to serve the needs of the then fledgling Muslim community of Ealing and Hanwell. The original Mosque based at 119 and 121 Oaklands Road consisted of two shops that had been converted to accommodate men and women. This mosque is currently under construction and will likely be completed in Mid-Late 2019 and become one of the largest mosques in London. There are also two Hindu temples housed in former church buildings, and West Ealing is also the location of Ealing Liberal Synagogue. Political representation West Ealing is made up of three electoral wards for local council elections: Cleveland, Elthorne and Walpole; it is also served by small portions of the Northfields and Ealing Broadway wards. These wards each elect three councillors to the Ealing Council. Recent elections have seen seats changing parties; as of the 2014 election the area has mainly Labour representation, with Labour councillors in Elthorne and Walpole and two Labour and one Conservative councillor in Cleveland. West Ealing was in the parliamentary constituency of Ealing Southall (represented since 2007 by Labour Member of Parliament Virendra Sharma), until boundary changes for the 2010 general election moved Walpole into the newly formed Ealing Central and Acton constituency (represented since 2015 by Labour MP Rupa Huq). Portions of the area are in the Ealing North constituency, represented by Labour MP Stephen Pound. West Ealing is in the London Assembly constituency of Ealing and Hillingdon, which has one assembly member: Onkar Sahota (Labour), who was elected in May 2012. Geography Although there is no official boundaries for West Ealing, with the exception of Grosvenor Road, in W7, all of it falls into the postcode district W13 within London's Post Town.

The airframe was based on a shortened Tu-204 fuselage and a scaled-down version of that aircraft's wing. Unlike the Tu-204, however, the Tu-334 has a T-tail and engines mounted on the sides of the rear fuselage instead of under the wings. With the rationalisation of the Russian aircraft companies in 2009 to form United Aircraft Corporation it was decided not to continue with the programme. Development Tu-334 cabin. The Tupolev Design Bureau introduced the Tu-334 in early as an eventual propfan-powered airliner to potentially enter service for Aeroflot in . However, it would have an interim turbofan-powered version that would begin airline service around 1991‚Äì1992. Consuming about 20 percent less fuel than the best Soviet turbofan, the propfan engine would be a then- unnamed geared powerplant from the Lotarev engine design bureau. The engine would have a thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC) of , resulting in a per- passenger aircraft fuel consumption rate of . The turbofan-powered version of the Tu-334 would use Lotarev D-436T engines with a TSFC of and a bypass ratio of 6.5, and it would consume per passenger. The propfan Tu-334 would seat 104-137 passengers, compared with 86-102 passengers for the shorter, turbofan Tu-334. Tupolev confirmed the use of the D-436 for the turbofan version shortly afterward. However, they initiated discussions with International Aero Engines (IAE) at the 1989 Paris Air Show to discuss using a derated version of IAE's V2500 engine. The talks, which continued through at least the end of the year, were attributed to worries that the Lotarev could not meet Tupolev's timeline or fuel burn targets, or that Tupolev was canceling the propfan version. There was also concern that Tupolev could not meet Soviet state carrier Aeroflot's urgent capacity needs quick enough. In this scenario, the Soviet aircraft production ministry could allow the Yakovlev Design Bureau to compete and build the Yak-42M (a Yak-42 airliner derivative) because of its quicker availability, despite the ministry's assumed preference for the Tu-334. Information about the propfan engine began to be revealed during the second quarter of , although the details were often conflicting. In April , while announcing the interim aircraft's service entry date of 1993, Tupolev's chief designer said that the ultrahigh bypass engine to be used would be a Lotarev (now renamed to the Progress design bureau) propfan resembling the General Electric GE36 UDF, and not the propfan it had been working on. However, the Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM), a Soviet engine research institute, reported that Tupolev expected to have a propfan Tu-334 operating by the 1995-1997 period, probably using a geared propfan instead of gearless. Then a subsequent report named the Tu-334 propfan engine as the Lotarev D-27, a , powerplant with a TSFC of . The D-27 would also power the newly announced Yakovlev Yak-46 propfan airliner, which was similar to the Yak-42M competitor but used two propfans instead of three turbofans in the aft fuselage. Three weeks later, Tupolev said that government officials would decide shortly between two D-27 offshoot engines from the Progress design bureau for the final Tu-334 version in 1996: a Progress D-227 propfan, or a Progress D-527 \\"super contrafan,\\" an ungeared but ducted contra-rotating powerplant with a bypass ratio of 18. Days earlier, the Soviet Union premiered a running propfan engine before Western audiences for the first time, flying an Ilyushin Il-76LL testbed aircraft with one installed Progress D-236 engine to the ILA Air Show in Hannover, Germany. Although the Soviets declined in Hannover to name the aircraft that would use the D-236, an October 1990 article named that geared engine as the powerplant for the final Tu-334 variant, which would compete against the D-27-powered Yak-46 for Aeroflot's Tu-134 replacement order. Work commenced on the Tu-334 in the early 1990s, but proceeded slowly due to funding problems arising from the breakup of the Soviet Union. A prototype was displayed in 1995, but this was little more than a mockup with few systems installed. A functional aircraft first flew on February 8, 1999, and later that year, agreements were put in place for MiG to undertake part of the production of the airliner. A Russian type certificate was obtained ‚Äì after some delay ‚Äì on December 30, 2003. Development remained slow due to protracted budget problems. In turn, the certification of the aircraft and its planned entry into serial production was delayed multiple times. As of December 2006 there were firm orders for the Tupolev Tu-334 from seven airlines, including Atlant-Soyuz Airlines and there were letters of intent from 24 airlines to obtain another 297 airplanes.Flight International, 3‚Äì9 October 2006 The price per unit for the business version is estimated to be around $43‚Äì44 million. One of the projected customers for the type was Iran. The Iran Aviation Industries Organization (IAIO) was in negotiations to purchase licenses to assemble the aircraft in Iran by 2011 and manufacture them completely by 2015 alongside the Tu-214. Nothing concrete became of these negotiations before the cancellation of the Tu-334 programme. As late as 2008, Tupolev reported that a total of about 100 airlines had expressed an interest in placing orders for Tu-334s; on July 31, 2008, Tupolev Managing Director Sergei Ilyushenkov announced that production was targeted to begin no later than January 2009. However, this date also passed without any reported progress on Tu-334 serial production. In 2009, with the project years behind the projected schedule and only two examples built and flying ten years after the first flight, the Tu-334 came under review during the rationalisation of the Russian aircraft companies, which led to the formation of United Aircraft Corporation. In mid-2009, the decision was taken to not continue with the Tu-334 programme and instead focus efforts on the Sukhoi Superjet 100, the Antonov An-148, and the Irkut MC-21.

ESET NOD32 Antivirus is sold in two editions, Home Edition and Business Edition. The Business Edition packages add ESET Remote Administrator allowing for server deployment and management, mirroring of threat signature database updates and the ability to install on Microsoft Windows Server operating systems. History =NOD32= The acronym NOD stands for Nemocnica na Okraji Disku (\\"Hospital at the end of the disk\\"), a pun related to the Czechoslovak medical drama series Nemocnice na kraji mƒõsta (Hospital at the End of the City). The first version of NOD32 - called NOD-ICE - was a DOS-based program. It was created in 1987 by Miroslav Trnka and Peter Pa≈°ko at the time when computer viruses started to become increasingly prevalent on PCs running DOS. Due to the limitations of the OS (lack of multitasking among others) it didn't feature any on-demand/on-access protection nor most of the other features of the current versions. Besides the virus scanning and cleaning functionality it only featured heuristic analysis. With the increasing popularity of the Windows environment, advent of 32-bit CPUs, a shift on the PC market and increasing popularity of the Internet came the need for a completely different antivirus approach as well. Thus the original program was re-written and christened \\"NOD32\\" to emphasize both the radical shift from the previous version and its Win32 system compatibility. Initially the program gained popularity with IT workers in Eastern European countries, as ESET was based in Slovakia. Though the program's abbreviation was originally pronounced as individual letters, the worldwide use of the program led to the more common single-word pronunciation, sounding like the English word nod. Additionally, the \\"32\\" portion of the name is an anachronism with the release of a 64-bit version in the Windows 7 era. The company reached its 10000th update to virus definitions on June 25, 2014. =Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server= On March 10, 2010 ESET released ESET Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server, which contains both antimalware and antispam modules.ESET launches ESET Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server and ESET Smart Security 4.2 It supports Microsoft Exchange 5.5, 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2010. =Mobile Security= Android, from Google Play Video on how to scan device using ESET Mobile Security for Android Video on how to download and install ESET Smart Security for Desktop computer ESET Mobile Security is the replacement for ESET Mobile Antivirus, which provided anti- malware and antispam functionality.

Biography =Early history= The band was formed by middle school students Steve Hurley, Dave Gibbs, Phil Hurley, and Paul Brouwer in 1981 in Potsdam, New York, United States, originally known as Sniper. In 1986, their name changed to Gigolo Aunts (after the Syd Barrett song, \\"Gigolo Aunt\\", from his 1970 album Barrett) and became a staple on the Northern New York music scene, gaining a reputation for frenetic live sets that featured the close harmonies of the Hurley brothers and Gibbs. In the summer of 1987 the band relocated to Boston, Massachusetts, and within a year were signed to Hoboken's Coyote Records (then home of the Feelies and Yo La Tengo). Their first album entitled Everybody Happy was produced by former Bongo bassist (and late version Velvet Underground member), Rob Norris, and released in 1988. After touring up and down the east coast, the band returned to Boston and began working on their follow up album with producer Paul Kolderie. Early in the sessions, Coyote Records folded, and only a handful of songs were finished. After a year of slugging in out in the Boston clubs and recording new songs with Kolderie, the band completed Tales from the Vinegar Side, which was released only in Spain on Impossible Records in 1990. The album produced a modest Boston area radio hit in \\"Down on Me\\". =Chart success= In fall 1991, the band released the \\"Bloom\\"/\\"Cope\\" 7 inch single on their own Summerville records. The single garnered rave reviews on both sides of the Atlantic and heavy Boston area airplay, which led to a record deal with Fire Records in the UK. An EP, Full- On Bloom, was released in July 1993 and an album, Flippin' Out, made with producers Mike Deneen and Adam Lasus, was released in the UK in October 1993. The band supported Suede and the Cranberries on their first major U.S. tour and a tour of Japan. The band toured extensively in Europe in support of Flippin' Out, opening for the Wonderstuff. After signing to RCA Records in the US early in 1994, the band released the slightly altered American version of Flippin' Out and spent the year supporting the record in Europe and America. Their biggest commercial success was the single, \\"Where I Find My Heaven\\", which featured in the soundtrack to the film Dumb and Dumber, and as the opening music to the British sitcom Game On. The single release of \\"Where I Find My Heaven\\" broke into the Top 30 in the UK Singles Chart early in 1995. The band also composed the song, \\"Little Wild One\\", for the movie, That Thing You Do! =Later history= In the winter of 1995, drummer Paul Brouwer left and was replaced by Fred Eltringham, then of the Boston band, Jack Drag. In the fall of 1995, the band entered the studio with producer Fred Maher to record the follow-up to Flippin' Out, tentatively titled Ultraphonic. The subsequent recordings were never released and soon after Phil Hurley left the band and was replaced by 6L6 guitarist, Jon Skibic. In 1996, after getting released from their RCA deal, the band began the long process of ending their relationship with Fire Records. In the meantime, they released an EP, Learn to Play Guitar, on the indie Wicked Disc label, which allowed them to tour extensively in support of the Wallflowers and Counting Crows. On July 2, 1997, Counting Crows kicked off a co-headlining tour with The Wallflowers that continued through September. This tour included opening acts by Bettie Serveert, Engine 88, Gigolo Aunts and That Dog, with each opening band touring for a three-week stretch.Billboard Magazine, May 24, 1997, Page 16 (link accessed January 14, 2015) While touring with Counting Crows, The Wallflowers were also playing their own headlining dates when the Counting Crows tour was on break (Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz experienced swollen vocal cords and had to back out of several shows in July). After settling their contract status in 1998, the band signed a new deal with E Pluribus Unum Records, a subsidiary of Universal Records owned and led by Counting Crows' singer, Adam Duritz. The band entered the studio once again with producer Mike Denneen and produced the haunting Minor Chords and Major Themes, which featured the minor hit, \\"Everyone Can Fly\\". Minor Chords And Major Themes was a hit in Spain and led to the band's long-standing popularity in that country and appearance at the Benicassim Festival in 1999. In 2000, primary songwriters Gibbs and Hurley relocated to Los Angeles to pursue songwriting for film and TV. After writing for Josie and the Pussycats and a number of TV shows, Gibbs and Hurley recorded one final Gigolo Aunts album, Pacific Ocean Blues, (produced by Chris Horvath) accompanied by Skibic and Eltringham on most tracks and by Mark Rivers and Phil Hurley on others. The album was released in Spain on Love to Art Records and in the U.S on Q Division Records.

(2010). Scotland. Cicerone Press. p. 283. Description Although there have been many purported encounters with Am Fear Liath M√≤r, few eyewitnesses have seen the creature. Those who have describe it as an extremely tall figure covered with short hair, or as an unseen presence that causes uneasy feelings in people who climb the mountain. Other eyewitnesses describe it as a large humanoid standing over ten feet tall and having olive toned skin with long arms and broad shoulders. Evidence of the existence of this creature is limited to various sightings and a few photographs of unusual footprints. Nearly all reports of Am Fear Liath M√≤r include the sound of footsteps crunching in the gravel just out of sight. Sightings The summit of Ben Macdui The first recorded encounter with Am Fear Liath M√≤r was reported in 1891 but wasn't made public until 1925. In 1925, the noted climber J. Norman Collie recounted a terrifying experience he had endured while alone near the summit of Ben MacDhui some 35 years before. \\"I began to think I heard something else than merely the noise of my own footsteps. For every few steps I took I heard a crunch, and then another crunch as if someone was walking after me but taking steps three or four times the length of my own.\\" Collie was unable to make out the source of the noises because of mist, and continued \\"... [as] the eerie crunch, crunch, sounded behind me, I was seized with terror and took to my heels, staggering blindly among the boulders for four or five miles.\\" Collie's account was reported in the local press and followed by a correspondence on the subject. Norman G. Forbes reported that he had heard a mysterious clanking noise while climbing Braeriach in summer mist. It proved to be two deer. He noted that the Cairngorms ‚Äúhave an uncanny power of inducing a feeling of eeriness‚Äù and \\"the mind, alone in lonely places, creates many things out of its imagining\\" . However, some climbers have also reported similar experiences, many describing uncontrollable feelings of fear and panic, some seeing a huge grey figure behind them, and others only hearing sounds. For example, in 1904 climber Hugh D. Welsh heard unexplained \\"slurring footsteps\\" near the summit of Ben Macdhui and had \\"an eerie feeling of apprehension\\", while in 1945 Peter Densham, a mountaineer and rescue worker, heard ‚Äúa crunching noise‚Äù and was ‚Äúovercome by a feeling of apprehension‚Äù and in 1948 Richard Frere, a climber, wrote about his sense of ‚Äúa Presence, utterly abstract but intensely real‚Äù on the mountain and heard ‚Äúan intensely high singing note‚Äù. In 1958, an encounter was published in The Scots magazine by naturalist and mountaineer Alexander Tewnion: > ...In October 1943 I spent a ten day leave climbing alone in the > Cairngorms... One afternoon, just as I reached the summit cairn of Ben > MacDhui, mist swirled across the Lairig Ghru and enveloped the mountain. The > atmosphere became dark and oppressive, a fierce, bitter wind whisked among > the boulders, and... an odd sound echoed through the mist ‚Äì a loud footstep, > it seemed. Then another, and another... A strange shape loomed up, receded, > came charging at me! Without hesitation I whipped out the revolver and fired > three times at the figure. When it still came on I turned and hared down the > path, reaching Glen Derry in a time that I have never bettered. You may ask > was it really the Fear Laith Mhor? Frankly, I think it was. Explanations Illusions, hallucinations or misinterpretation of natural stimulus brought on by exhaustion or isolation have been proposed by psychologists.Reed, Graham. (1988). The Psychology of Anomalous Experience. Prometheus Books. pp. 44‚Äì45. Infrasound, which can be generated by wind, can cause feelings of uneasiness and anxiety and is possibly connected to paranormal sightings. An optical illusion known as the Brocken spectre is a plausible explanation for some visual elements of the Big Grey Man legend.Brown, Dave; Mitchell, Ian. (1987). Mountain Days and Bothy Nights. Luath. p. 157. A Brocken spectre, \\"mountain spectre\\" can occur in certain atmospheric conditions when the sun is at a particular angle. The subject's shadow can be cast onto a cloud bank around them, creating the illusion of a large shadowy humanoid figure.Ross, Helen. (1975). Mist, Murk and Visual Perception. New Scientist. p. 658. \\"The Brocken Spectre (where one's shadow cast by the sun onto a cloudbank appears distant and gigantic)... The shadowy image appearing much farther away than it is, and consequently enlarged to a sufficient extent to give rise to such tales as the Grey Man of Ben MacDhui.\\" The poet James Hogg encountered a Brocken spectre on Ben MacDhui as far back as 1791, describing \\"a giant blackamoor, at least thirty feet high, and equally proportioned, and very near me. I was actually struck powerless with astonishment and terror.\\" Hogg's terror subsided when he observed the figure making the same gestures as his own, and he satisfied himself that it was merely his own shadow. British mountaineer Frank Smythe stated he had observed his shadow cast as a Brocken Spectre across the mist on Ben Macdhui.Smythe, Frank. (1949). Behold the Mountains: Climbing with a Color Camera. Chanticleer Press. p. 55 Popular culture The creature is referenced in Captive, the first book in K.M. Fawcett's Survival Race series. In the book it's revealed that the Fear Liath is a member of an alien species called Hyboreans.

The National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH; ) started operations under Japanese rule in Dait≈çtei (today's Dadaocheng) on 18 June 1895, and moved to its present location in 1898. The Hospital was later annexed to the Medical School of Taihoku Imperial University and renamed Taihoku Imperial University Medical School Affiliated Hospital in 1937. The present name was adopted after the Republic of China took over the hospital upon Taiwan's retrocession in 1945. On 19 October 1991, the completion of a large new building complex on the so- called East Site marked another milestone in the history of the NTUH. Today, the (new) East and (old) West Sites together have more than 4,000 employees, serving 2,000 inpatients and 8,000 outpatients daily. Advanced surgical, angiographical, and endoscopic procedures are routinely performed. Heart Transplant Division The NTUH Heart Transplant is a staple part of National Taiwan University Hospital. It has performed numerous successful heart transplants since the founding of the hospital in 1895. Despite its relatively young start, the Heart Transplant Division performed its first successful heart transplantation in 1986. Not only was it the first heart transplant in NTUH, but it was also, more importantly, the first heart transplant in all of Taiwan. Since then, it has expanded rapidly. In 1991, NTUH performed their first domino heart transplant. Later in 1995, NTUH was the first in all of Asia to implant biventricular-assist devices which were then bridged successfully into a heart transplant.

Born in Derma, Mississippi, Glenn Hardin was the world's dominant 400 m hurdler in the 1930s and was equally tough in the 400 m flat race. Hardin's rise began at the 1932 Summer Olympics, where he finished second in the 400 m hurdles in 52.0 but was given credit for a world record when the winner, Bob Tisdall from Ireland, knocked down a hurdle, an error that in those days disqualified a performance for world record consideration. Hardin lowered the record to 51.8 in the 1934 AAU championships and then bettered it to 50.6 during a meet in Stockholm later that year. That record would stand for the next nineteen years. Hardin was unbeatable between the 1932 and 1936 Olympics, winning the AAU title in 1933, 1934 and 1936 in 400 m hurdles and NCAA championships title in 1933 and 1934 in hurdles.

It was founded in 1942, closed after World War II, and then reestablished in 1953. Its primary mission is to acquire new knowledge of nature, society and technology, specifically targeted at ensuring scientific basis for the advancement in Slovakia. It comprises 58 scientific institutes and 13 ancillary institutions. The SAV edits 44 scientific and scholarly journals and 100‚Äì120 monographs per annum. Moreover, 41 scientific and scholarly societies, which associate scientists and scholars from various disciplines, are affiliated with SAV.  History  The commencement of modern science in the 16th and 17th centuries resulted in the establishment of new institutions that supplemented classical universities and created a broader forum for fostering science communication. These institutions, which were built on the ancient Platonic traditions, became the starting point of our present day academies of sciences. Matej Bel‚Äôs project, submitted in 1735, marked the first attempt to establish such an institution on the territory of modern Slovakia. He suggested the founding of a Societas litteraria in Bratislava. His project, however, never materialized. In 1792, upon a proposal issued by a group of patriotic philologists, Slovenske ucene tovarisstvo (The Slovak Learned Society) was founded. In 1844, under the impetus of Ludovit Stur, the nationwide cultural association, Tatrin, was instituted. A few years later, in 1892, Andrej Kmet published in Narodne noviny (National News) his appeal to establish Slovensky vedecky spolok [Slovak Scientific Association], or Slovenska akademia vied [Slovak Academy of Sciences]. This idea led to the formation of Muzealna spolocnost slovenska [Slovak Association of Museums]. On 2 July 1942, the Parliament of the Slovak Republic instituted Slovenska akademia vied an umeni [Slovak Academy of Sciences and Arts], which developed into a representative and, concomitantly, working institution fostering scientific scholarly research. During the post-World War II period the SAVU was transformed into Slovenska akademia vied -Slovak Academy of Sciences (hereinafter the Academy or the SAS as an abbreviation). Its establishment was legally grounded in an act passed by the Slovak National Council on 18 June 1953. The arrangement of its operation was regulated further by appurtenant legislation. On 17 November 1989, significant changes at the Academy were introduced. Since then, far‚Äìreaching transformations enabled the Academy to become similar to counterpart organisations of science and research in advanced countries abroad.  Present  Service mark of the Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAV) Nowadays, the Slovak Academy of Sciences successfully presents itself nationally and worldwide through the results in basic and applied research. It consists of 69 organisations, of which 48 are budgetary and 21 are subsidised. The Academy publishes 57 scientific and professional journals and 8 yearbooks. There are 51 scientific and scholarly associations, societies and unions affiliated with the SAS, which operate in accordance with the Law on Civic Associations. The Assembly, the Scientific Council, and the Presidium are the Academy‚Äôs self-governing bodies. The Assembly is the supreme self- governing Academy‚Äôs body. Its members are elected by the academic staff of the respective scientific organisations from the academic staff of the SAS. The Scientific Council is a self-governing body of the Academy that deliberates upon scientific and conceptional tasks. It is composed of the President of the Academy and other members of the Academy‚Äôs Presidium, representatives delegated from the higher education sector, and a representative from the sector of business enterprising engaged in scientific research and development. Membership of the Scientific Council also includes representatives from organisations and institutions engaged in scientific research and development outside the Academy, appointed by the Chair of the Academy‚Äôs Assembly on the basis of elections of the members in the Scientific Council held by the Assembly. The Presidium is an executive self-governing body of the Academy. The Presidium is composed of the President, vice- presidents, Scientific Secretary, and other members of the Presidium, appointed by the Chair of the Academy‚Äôs Assembly on the basis of the electoral returns for the Academy‚Äôs Presidium. The Academy is presided by the President, who is appointed and recalled by the President of the Slovak Republic. The Presidium of the Academy coordinates and supervises the activities of the Academy and the performance of its organisations via the sections for the respective groups of science branches.

Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town. The project has received criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which they allege violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.

Her family is of the House of Dinefwr. Nest was the wife of Gerald de Windsor (c. 1075 ‚Äì 1135), constable of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, by whom she was the ancestress of the FitzGerald dynasty and of the prominent Carew family, of Moulsford in Berkshire, Carew Castle in Pembrokeshire (in the Kingdom of Deheubarth) and of Mohuns Ottery in Devon (see Baron Carew, Earl of Totnes and Carew baronets).Vivian, Lt.Col.

After their father's death in battle in 1093, \\"the kingdom of the Britons fell\\" and was overrun by Normans. Nest's younger brother Gruffydd was spirited into Ireland for safety; their brother Hywel may have been captured by Arnulf de Montgomery, along with their mother, unless, as appears likelier, their mother was captured with Nest; their fate is unknown. Two older brothers, illegitimate sons of Rhys, one of them named Goronwy, were captured and executed. First marriage and issue Nest was brought as a prized hostage to the court of William Rufus, where she came to the attention of his younger brother Henry Beauclerc (the future King Henry I), to whom she bore one of his numerous illegitimate children, Henry FitzHenry (c. 1103‚Äì1158).Gerald of Wales, The Journey Through Wales and The Description of Wales tr. Lewis Thorpe. Harmondsworth: Penguin (1978) Some time after the rebellions of Robert of Normandy and Robert of Belesme, head of the powerful Montgomery family of Normandy and England, the king married Nest to Gerald FitzWalter of Windsor, Arnulf de Montgomery's former lieutenant and constable for Pembroke Castle. In 1102, for siding with the Montgomerys against the king, Gerald had been removed from control of Pembroke, and one Saher, a knight loyal to Henry, installed in his place. When Saher proved untenable in his new position, the king restored Gerald to Pembroke in 1105, along with Nest as his wife.Gerald of Wales. The Journey Through Wales and The Description of Wales tr. Lewis Thorpe. Harmondsworth: Penguin (1978) By Gerald, Nest is the maternal progenitor of the FitzGerald dynasty, one of the most celebrated families of Ireland and Great Britain. They are referred to as Cambro-Normans or Hiberno-Normans, and have been peers of Ireland since 1316, when Edward II created the earldom of Kildare for John FitzGerald. Nest bore Gerald at least five children, three sons and two daughters. * William FitzGerald, Lord of Carew and Emlyn (died c. 1173), who is said to have married Marie, a daughter of Arnulf de Montgomery. William's children included Raymond FitzGerald le Gros. * Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Llanstephan, Naas and Maynooth, (died 1 September 1177). He is said to have married Alice, another supposed daughter of Arnulf de Montgomery. His children included Gerald FitzMaurice, 1st Lord of Offaly. * David FitzGerald, Archdeacon of Cardigan and Bishop of St David's. * Angharad, who married William Fitz Odo de Barry, by whom she was the mother of Robert de Barry, Philip de Barry, founder of Ballybeg Abbey at Buttevant in Ireland, and of Gerald de Barry, better known as Gerald of Wales. * Gwladys, mother of Milo de Cogan Second marriage and issue After Gerald's death, Nest's sons married her to Stephen, her husband's constable of Cardigan, by whom she had another son, Robert Fitz- Stephen (d. 1182), one of the Norman conquerors of Ireland. Rape and abduction Cilgerran Castle, the possible site of Nest's abduction The details of this most famous episode of Nest's life, thought to have occurred in 1109, are obscure differ from one account to another. The most common alternative narratives are: *Nest and Gerald were present at an eisteddfod given, during a truce, by Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, prince of Powys *Nest and her husband were \\"visited\\" by her second cousin Owain ap Cadwgan, one of Cadwgan's sons, at Carew Castle, Gerald escaping down the latrine shaft. *The castle of Cenarth Bychan (possibly modern Cilgerran Castle), home of Nest and her husband, was attacked by Owain ap Cadwgan and his menBrut y tywysogion: Or, The chronicle of the princes A.D. 681‚Äì1282 (Great Britain. Public Record Office. Kraus Reprints: 1965, ASIN: B0007JD67I The earliest account, that of Caradoc of Llancarfan, relates that \\"At the instigation of the Devil, he [Owain] was moved by passion and love for the woman, and with a small company with him...he made for the castle by night.\\" The story that takes place at Carew Castle says Nest urged her husband to escape via a lavatory chute , while she stayed to face Owain. Owain took Nest and her children to a hunting lodge by the Eglwyseg Rocks north of the Vale of Llangollen. The abduction of Nest, whether or not it was with her consent, aroused the wrath of the Normans, as well as of the Welsh. The Norman lords, the Justiciar of Salop, and at least one bishop, bribed Owain's Welsh enemies to attack him and his father, which they promptly did.Johnson, Ben. \\"Princess Nest\\", History UK Owain's father tried to persuade him to return Nest, but to no avail. According to Caradoc, Nest told Owain, \\"If you would have me stay with you and be faithful to you, then send my children home to their father.\\" She secured the return of the children. Owain and his father were driven to seek exile in Ireland. Nest was returned to her husband. In recent years, Nest has been given two specious children by her rapist, Llywelyn and Einion. In fact, Owain had a brother, but not a son, named Einion, and Welsh genealogies do not name the mother of Owain's son Llywelyn. The omission of the name of a mother with the highborn status of Nest is startling, if it were true. In the 19th century, this \\"abduction\\", as well as the fighting which followed, earned Nest the nickname \\"Helen of Wales\\". She was depicted at having connived with Owain at her rape and abduction, given more children than she had borne, along with more lovers than she had had. In 1112, her brother Gruffydd returned from Ireland, spending most of his time with Gerald and Nest. When he was denied his inheritance from his father, and accused to the king of conspiring against him, he allied with the prince of Gwynedd, and war broke out. Owain ap Cadwgan had, by now, been pardoned by the king, and was prince of Powys; in 1111, his father had been assassinated by Owain's cousin and former comrade-in-arms, Madog ap Rhiryd, whom Owain captured, castrated, and blinded. Being then on the king's good side, Owain was ordered to rendezvous with a Norman force to proceed against Gruffydd. En route, he and his force chanced to run into none other than Gerald FitzWalter. Despite Owain being a royal ally, Gerald chose to avenge his wife's rape, and killed Owain. Ancestry  Notes  References Additional Sources *Clark, Geo. Thomas.

It appears as a part of The Krusty the Clown Show. Itself an animated cartoon, The Itchy & Scratchy Show depicts a blue mouse, Itchy (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), who repeatedly and violently maims and/or kills a black cat, Scratchy (voiced by Harry Shearer). The cartoon first appeared in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"The Bart Simpson Show\\", which aired on November 20, 1988. The cartoon's first appearance in The Simpsons was in the 1990 episode \\"There's No Disgrace Like Home\\". Typically presented as 15- to 60-second-long cartoons, the show is filled with gratuitous violence that almost invariably prompts uproarious laughter from Bart and Lisa. The Simpsons also occasionally features characters who are involved with the production of The Itchy & Scratchy Show, including Roger Meyers Jr. (voiced by Alex Rocco, and, later, Hank Azaria), who runs the studio and produces the show. The Itchy and Scratchy characters are extremely violent and bloody parodies of Tom and Jerry and Herman and Katnip; the names were inspired by the Looney Tunes characters Sylvester and Tweety. The Italian comic strip Squeak the Mouse is also considered as an apparent inspiration for the characters.The Comics Journal, Issues 280-283, Comics Journal Incorporated, 2007, p.27.Giuseppe Pollicelli (28 August 2011), \\"Massimo Mattioli: il Disney del porno-horror\\", Libero. The mouse (or mice) are almost always the aggressors and, as opposed to Tom and Jerry, they relentlessly attempt to kill Scratchy and any other cats around. The cartoons became popular among the show's writers and animators, and they are often added when an episode needs expanding. As the shorts became popular with fans, the writers decided to have full episodes that centered on the production of The Itchy & Scratchy Show and featured multiple shorts. The first was \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\\" (season two, 1990), which was a commentary on censorship. Other episodes to feature the show in a prominent role include \\"Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie\\" (season four, 1992), \\"The Front\\" (season four, 1993), \\"Itchy & Scratchy Land\\" (season six, 1994), \\"The Day the Violence Died\\" (season seven, 1996), \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\" (season eight, 1997) and \\"Treehouse of Horror IX\\" (season ten, 1998). Role in The Simpsons The Itchy & Scratchy Show is a show within a show that appears occasionally in episodes of The Simpsons. They appear in the form of 12-60 second cartoons that are filled with gratuitous violence, usually initiated by Itchy the mouse against Scratchy the cat; Itchy is almost always the victor. Itchy & Scratchy airs as a segment on The Krusty the Clown Show, and also aired on its brief replacements, Sideshow Bob's Cavalcade of Whimsy and Gabbo. Itchy & Scratchy is usually a parody of traditional cartoons or takeoffs on famous films, but the plot and content are always violent and bloody. The most direct and obvious example is Tom and Jerry, an animated series which was also about a constant battle between a cat and a mouse, with the mouse usually victorious. Itchy & Scratchy also includes shorts such as Scratchtasia, a parody of Fantasia, and Pinitchio, a parody of Pinocchio. Animation-related jokes are prevalent in the show, such as the Manhattan Madness cartoon in \\"The Day the Violence Died\\", which is based on very early animated cartoons such as Gertie the Dinosaur. The cartoons also occasionally serve to play out an exaggerated form of the conflict in the surrounding episode. For example, in \\"Deep Space Homer\\" (season five, 1994), Homer is recruited by NASA, and later watches an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon which directly (and gruesomely) parodies the films 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien. =Fictional production history= Chester J. Lampwick created Itchy for the now-lost silent cartoon Manhattan Madness, in which the mouse brutally attacks and kills an Irishman and Theodore Roosevelt, in 1919 (the year of the first Felix the Cat cartoon). However, the character was later stolen by Roger Meyers. Scratchy starred in his first cartoon in 1928, titled That Happy Cat. The film, a 13-second-long animation showing the cat whistling and tipping his hat, was a commercial failure. Later that year, Itchy and Scratchy starred in their first cartoon together, Steamboat Itchy, a violent parody of Disney's Steamboat Willie. Along with the cartoon shorts, Itchy and Scratchy were featured in a World War II-era radio series, at least two films ‚Äî Pinitchio and Scratchtasia (parodies of Pinocchio and Fantasia), and television commercials for Laramie Cigarettes. Itchy & Scratchy Studios is run by Roger Meyers Jr., the son of Roger Meyers, the cartoon's \\"creator.\\" The studio was bankrupted after it was sued by Lampwick for $800 million, but was saved after receiving a large cash settlement from the government over its use of Mr. ZIP. The show underwent a brief, non-violent retooling following a protest campaign led by Marge Simpson, but returned to its original violent format after Marge was later discredited. Itchy & Scratchy has spawned an Academy Award-winning film adaptation, amusement parks, and a musical, and like Krusty's show, localized versions are produced for other countries, such as Jamaica's The Itchem and Scratchem Blow. Characters =The Itchy & Scratchy Show= Itchy the mouse and Scratchy the cat are the main characters in the show. The duo first appeared in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"The Bart Simpson Show,\\" which aired November 20, 1988, the performance style at the time was like Tom and Jerry. Their first appearance in The Simpsons was \\"There's No Disgrace Like Home.\\" Itchy, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, is a blue mouse, and usually the aggressor and the victor over the hapless Scratchy in their battles. An exception is in \\"Homer Goes to College\\" (season five, 1993). Bart and Lisa watch a cartoon called \\"Burning Down the Mouse\\", as Lisa puts it, \\"This is the one where Scratchy finally gets Itchy\\". However, due to the Simpsons' television being accidentally unplugged, the viewer does not see the end of the cartoon and Krusty proclaims that the network will never let it be shown again, to Bart and Lisa's fury. Scratchy, voiced by Harry Shearer, is a threadbare, dim-witted black cat and the victim of relentless abuse from the sadistic mouse, Itchy. The writers often forget which character is which; a trick they use is that Scratchy contains the letters C, A, and T. Poochie, voiced by Dan Castellaneta and Alex Rocco, is an orange dog that appeared in \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\" (season eight, 1997). In the episode, the producers of The Itchy & Scratchy Show believed the cartoons were getting stale, and needed a new character to reinvigorate the show. Homer Simpson gets the job of voicing Poochie, who is introduced in the cartoon, \\"The Beagle Has Landed\\". A product of marketing department thinking, Poochie was near- universally despised, and was killed off in his second appearance, despite Homer's objections. The episode was both a reference to TV shows which added new characters purportedly to reinvigorate the show, and a commentary on the growing complaints of fans of The Simpsons. The original idea for the episode was that Poochie would be obnoxious because he was so rich, rather than because he was so cool. Poochie would later make brief speaking cameo appearances in \\"Treehouse of Horror IX\\" and \\"Little Big Mom.\\" Disgruntled Goat, Uncle Ant, Ku Klux Klam, an anthropomorphic goat, ant and clam, respectively, were characters introduced in a short-lived \\"Itchy and Scratchy and Friends\\" show. Bart and Lisa find plush toys of them in a gift shop in the \\"Itchy & Scratchy Land\\" episode. =Production staff= Roger Meyers Jr. in his first appearance in \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\\" Roger Meyers Jr., voiced by Alex Rocco and Hank Azaria, is the Chairman of the Board of Itchy & Scratchy Studios and son of Roger Meyers. He first appeared in \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\\" (season two, 1990). He distributes the cartoon and is a jaded and selfish businessman who has nothing but contempt for the children who comprise his audience. He also has an extremely callous personality; he only cares about people who can help him. This is displayed in his contempt for the writers of The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Alex Rocco also voiced Meyers in \\"The Day the Violence Died\\" and \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show.\\" He said that he liked voicing Meyers because \\"I get to be a big-shot.\\"Rocco, Alex (2006). Commentary for \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show,\\" in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. He professed being nervous when voicing the character for the first time in \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\\" because he said that he had never done a voice-over before. At first he tried doing a special voice, but was told to \\"just be yourself.\\" Rocco was one of Bill Oakley's and Josh Weinstein's favorite guest stars, and they liked including him in their episodes so they could \\"have a little fun with him.\\" On occasions when Rocco was unavailable to do a voice over, Meyers was voiced by Hank Azaria in \\"The Front\\" (season four, 1993), \\"Lady Bouvier's Lover\\" (season five, 1994) and \\"Itchy & Scratchy Land.\\" The spelling of Meyers' name has been inconsistent in the show. His last name was spelt both Myers and Meyers in \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge,\\" and Myers the later episode \\"The Day the Violence Died.\\" His name is spelt Meyers in \\"The Front,\\" as well as in the book The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family. Roger Meyers Sr. first appeared in video footage in \\"Itchy & Scratchy Land\\" and has never had a speaking role. He was created because the writers felt it would have been \\"tortured logic\\" to have the Roger Meyers Jr. be the creator. Roger Meyers Sr. has similarities to Walt Disney. For example, Disney's alleged antisemitism is spoofed when it is revealed that Meyers made a cartoon called Nazi Supermen are Our Superiors. June Bellamy, voiced by Tress MacNeille, is the actress who portrays both Itchy and Scratchy. Her only appearance was in \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show.\\" It is assumed she is a reference to veteran voice actress June Foray, based on the same first name. In the episode, Bellamy states that a woman voiced the characters, although Itchy and Scratchy are voiced by male actors. Chester J. Lampwick, voiced by Kirk Douglas, is the creator of Itchy and only appeared in \\"The Day the Violence Died.\\" The producers' first choice for the character, William Hickey, declined. Douglas's recording session was fraught with interruptions because he refused to wear the supplied earphones, and said the maximum he would do was two takes. Writing staff: In several episodes revolving around the production of The Itchy & Scratchy Show, caricatures of the show's staff are used as the staff of The Itchy & Scratchy Show. This first occurred in \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\\" where caricatures of animators David Silverman, Wes Archer and Rich Moore can be seen. In \\"The Front\\" many of the show's writers were used, this in-joke was purely an idea of the animators. John Swartzwelder, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Sam Simon, Jon Vitti and Mike Reiss all appeared in the episode.Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Lapidus, Adam I.; Reiss, Mike; Moore, Rich. (2004) Commentary for \\"The Front,\\" in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. This joke returned in \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\". Almost all of the writers shown are caricatures of the actual staff of The Simpsons. At the production table, David X. Cohen, Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein are shown, while Meyer speaks out and gets fired. The animator shown designing Poochie is Silverman. Others who appear include Dan McGrath, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Donick Cary, Ron Hauge, Ned Goldreyer and Mike Scully. Background =Origins= Itchy and Scratchy in their first appearance in \\"The Bart Simpson Show\\" The Itchy & Scratchy Show first appeared in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"The Bart Simpson Show,\\" which originally aired November 20, 1988. They were the first major recurring characters outside of the Simpson family to appear. As a child, series creator Matt Groening and his friends would fantasize about an ultra-violent cartoon and how much fun it would be to work on a show like that. The names \\"Itchy\\" and \\"Scratchy\\" were inspired by \\"Pixie and Dixie,\\" who were mice on the cartoon show Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks. The comic strip Squeak the Mouse is also considered as an apparent inspiration for the characters. Writer/producer Mike Reiss insists they are not based on Tom and Jerry but on Herman and Katnip, a \\"cheap, ultra-violent knockoff\\" of Tom and Jerry. Director David Silverman supports this, stating Herman and Katnip \\"is hilarious because it's just bad.\\" As a child, Groening really liked the 1961 Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians, and it was one of the reasons to why he got into cartooning. In the film, the puppies watch television, and the idea that it is possible to have a cartoon within a cartoon thrilled Groening. From that idea he got the inspiration for The Itchy & Scratchy Show. David Silverman states that Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are \\"an ironic commentary on cartoon mayhem in the sense that it's taken to a more realistic level. The kids on The Simpsons are laughing at it, and we're laughing too, but part of what you're laughing at is the over-the-top excessiveness of the violence.\\" =Development= Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are often added when a show needs expanding or when there is an issue that the writers wish to satirize. In some cases, notably in \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show,\\" the writers use Itchy & Scratchy as a way to comment on The Simpsons.Cohen, David X.; Groening, Matt; Moore, Steven Dean; Rocco, Alex; Smith, Yeardley; Weinstein, Josh. (2005) Commentary for \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The shorts are often difficult for the writers, and take much time to develop and devise a title, and in the end they fill little time. Writing the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons is quite often a group effort, with it being pitched out one gag after another. Itchy & Scratchy are a favorite of John Swartzwelder, who has written many of the episodes that center on them and quite often pitches the ideas for the shorts. In the early seasons, fans wanted more Itchy & Scratchy, so the writers decided to do \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge,\\" an episode also dealt with censorship issues which would allow them to show several cartoons.Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Lapidus, Reardon, Jim; Reiss, Mike. (2002) Commentary for \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The cartoons are often kept short, because according to David Silverman, \\"it doesn't really work as a long cartoon.\\" During his tenure as showrunner (season five and six) David Mirkin was asked by the Fox network not to do any more Itchy & Scratchy cartoons due to the amount of violence in them. In response, the show produced \\"Itchy & Scratchy Land.\\" The network asked them not to do the episode, and threatened that if the episode was produced, they would cut the Itchy & Scratchy parts out themselves, but relented when Mirkin threatened to tell the media. The writers nevertheless promised to try not to overdo the violence and in some scenes the violence was cut.Mirkin, David. (2005) Commentary for \\"Itchy & Scratchy Land,\\" in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. During their tenure as executive producers, Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein tried to fit in one episode relating to The Itchy & Scratchy Show every season. They note that as the seasons progressed, it became increasingly difficult for them to create new Itchy & Scratchy episode ideas.Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh. (2005) Commentary for \\"The Day the Violence Died\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Although the episode was difficult to animate, \\"Itchy & Scratchy Land\\" was \\"a dream come true\\" for the animators, as they enjoyed animating scenes filled with violence.Archer, Wes. (2005) Commentary for \\"Itchy & Scratchy Land,\\" in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Reception In a 2006 article, IGN ranked Itchy & Scratchy in tenth position on their list of the \\"Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters,\\" citing that \\"the Itchy & Scratchy Show shines a nice mirror on cartoons, showing just how funny cartoon violence really is.\\" In 2003, Entertainment Weekly named \\"Itchy & Scratchy Land\\" and \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\" the 7th-best and 23rd-best episodes of The Simpsons, respectively. In 2007, Vanity Fair named \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\" the sixth-best episode in the show's history, describing it as \\"a classic satire of network influence, obsessed TV fans, and programs that survive long after the shark has been jumped, the episode is a meta- celebration, a tongue-in-cheek rebuttal to everyone who claimed that the quality of The Simpsons had declined over the years.\\" Todd Gilchrist called it a masterpiece, stating it \\"could easily be packaged and sold by [itself].\\" Robert Canning of IGN writes that \\"it's always fun to see an 'Itchy and Scratchy' cartoon\\" but believes that the shorter and simpler cartoons are better than the longer more complex ones. In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Itchy & Scratchy as \\"by far the most gleeful visual riffing on The Simpsons [...] each snippet of \\"Itchy & Scratchy\\" packs as much frenetically paced action, sight-gaggery and physical humor into its half- minute of screen time as a half-dozen Road Runner cartoons and a dozen Tom & Jerrys.\\" In a 2014 Vulture article, the Simpsons writers ranked their nine favorite Itchy and Scratchy cartoons. Season-wise their choices ranged from season 4's \\"Steamboat Itchy\\" to Season 14's \\"Bleeder of the Pack\\", while also including the opening scene of The Simpsons Movie and the safety video \\"Safety First\\" that plays before The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios, both from 2007. Merchandising Itchy and Scratchy have appeared in various products and other media relating to The Simpsons.

He was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee as the U.S. escalated its involvement in the Vietnam War. Early life and education Mendel Rivers was born in Gumville, South Carolina, to Lucius Hampton Rivers and Henrietta Marion McCay. The family moved to St. Stephen in 1907 and lived comfortably until 1915, when Lucius died from pneumonia. Mendel's older brother Earle was put in charge of running the farm, but was not interested in agriculture and as a result the family's assets declined. Eventually, they were compelled to move to North Charleston where they opened up a boarding house on O'Hear Avenue. Rivers went to the local schools and it took him six years to graduate from Charleston High School in 1926. He then attended the College of Charleston for three years and the University of South Carolina School of Law for two years, graduating from neither. The law school dean at the University of South Carolina advised Rivers to take up another profession because although he knew the assignments, he suffered from stage fright. Rivers was determined to become a lawyer so he returned to College of Charleston, took classes to prepare himself for the bar examination, and passed in 1932. Unable to find employment in Charleston law firms, he started his own practice. Entry into politics Rivers first became involved in politics in 1930 when he participated in Ed Pritchard's unsuccessful campaign for the state legislature against Russell McGowan. He was an active member of the Charleston Young Democrats club and shortly after passing the bar, Rivers decided to run for one of the twelve state representative spots from Charleston County. County politics in the 1930s were controlled by the political machine of Charleston mayor Burnet R. Maybank, and gaining his endorsement was crucial to winning an election. Rivers sought the mayor's blessing, but was rejected because he was an unknown candidate from North Charleston. He ran as an Independent Democrat and was defeated in his bid for election. A vacancy on the Charleston County delegation arose in 1933 when Ben Scott Whaley resigned to join the staff of Senator James Francis Byrnes. Rivers won the special election by running against Charleston and campaigning on the slogan \\"Give the Northern End of the County Representation.\\"Ravenel p. 17 In 1934, Rivers ran for re-election and received the most votes of any state House candidate on the Charleston County ticket, making him chairman of the county delegation. As a state Representative, Rivers served on the Judiciary and Education committees. He became the state president of the Young Democrats in 1935 and was a delegate to the 1936 Democratic National Convention. The rapid ascendancy of Rivers attracted the attention of 1st district Congressman Thomas S. McMillan who became worried when Rivers requested papers from the state Democratic secretary in 1936 to run for office. McMillan arranged a meeting with Rivers and offered him a position as a Special Assistant to the Attorney General of the United States. Rivers accepted and worked throughout the South collecting unpaid criminal fines and forfeited bail bonds. =1940 election= On September 29, 1939, McMillan died and Rivers immediately made plans to run for Congress. He quit his federal job in February 1940 and opened a law practice in Charleston to provide a base for his campaign. His opponent in the Democratic primary was Alfred von Kolnitz, who had the backing of the Charleston political establishment and Thomas McMillan's widow, Clara. Rivers knew that he was not going to win the vote in Charleston, so he tried to maximize his vote outside of Charleston by making the theme of his campaign about the chicanery of the city. Furthermore, with World War II raging in Europe, Rivers played up von Kolnitz's German name to make him appear as if a Nazi sympathizer. On August 27, Rivers won the Democratic primary election by running up a huge margin in the counties outside of Charleston, which offset his loss in Charleston County. In those days, victory in the Democratic primary was tantamount to election in South Carolina, and Rivers took office on January 3, 1941. Congressional career =Domestic legislation= Once in Congress, Rivers sought a seat on the Agriculture committee, but it was full and he was instead placed on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries committee. In March, he was appointed to the Naval Affairs committee which was later combined with the Military Affairs committee to form the House Armed Services Committee. His first legislative success was in 1942 when he authored a bill to build an oil pipeline from Mississippi to the Southeast coast to reduce the transportation costs of the product. The bill was passed by Congress and signed by President Roosevelt, but Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes refused to construct the pipeline because of the opposition by Big Oil.Ravenel, p. 67 Rivers's first major success was the repeal of the federal tax on colored oleomargarine. The tax was first implemented because margarine was a much cheaper substitute of butter which threatened the interests of the dairy farmers. When Rivers first introduced the bill in 1944 to repeal the tax, it was vigorously opposed by Midwestern Representatives and the bill died in the agriculture committee. Undeterred, Rivers reintroduced the bill every year and made so many speeches in favor of the repeal of the tax that he was nicknamed \\"Oleo\\" Rivers.Rivers, p. 78 In 1949, he circulated a petition in the House to force the bill out of the agriculture committee and to the full House for a vote. The bill passed the House and then the Senate and was signed into law by President Truman in 1950. The manufacturers of margarine were forever grateful to Rivers and sent him complimentary boxes of oleo until the day he died.Rivers, p. 79 =Views regarding race= Like most South Carolinian Democrats from his era, Rivers was an ardent segregationist. He voted against every civil rights bill, and joined the entire South Carolina delegation in signing the Southern Manifesto in 1956. He attempted to have Charleston federal judge Waities Waring impeached for having ruled that blacks had to be allowed to vote in the Democratic primary and that segregated schools were unconstitutional. When President Truman integrated the U.S. Army in 1948, Rivers called him a \\"dead chicken\\" and a \\"bankrupt politician\\".Rivers, p. 90 Rivers was so incensed by Truman that he supported Strom Thurmond in the 1948 Presidential election. After Truman's victory, he lost his patronage privileges and was lucky to retain his seat on the Armed Services Committee. Rivers attended the 1952 Democratic National Convention and believed that Adlai Stevenson would reverse the policies of Truman by returning to traditional Democratic principles. However, Rivers became disillusioned with Stevenson and he openly supported Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1952 Presidential election because he said that he would be sensitive to Southern concerns.Ravenel, p. 99Rivers, p. 92 Rivers's long-held distrust of Republicans was reinforced shortly after Eisenhower became president when he ordered the desegregation of all schools on military bases and did not grant Rivers patronage privileges, despite Rivers being the only Democrat to support Eisenhower in 1952.Ravenel, p. 98 Eisenhower's continual push for integration infuriated Rivers. When asked if he would back Eisenhower again in 1956, Rivers later claimed to have responded \\"Hell no! Ain't no education in the second kick of a mule.\\" In the 1960s, Rivers softened his vocal opposition to civil rights legislation. He had risen in the ranks and his power in the House depended upon the continual support of national Democrats. Rivers shifted his approach from defending segregation to the maintenance of law and order. He found a kindred spirit in George Wallace and he attended one of Wallace's fundraising dinners in 1968. Wallace asked Rivers in July to be his running mate for the 1968 Presidential election, but Rivers dared not risk losing his chairmanship of the House Armed Services Committee and declined the offer.Rivers, p. 96 =Vietnam War, and the My Lai Massacre cover-up= Rivers was initially skeptical of America's escalation of the Vietnam War and the sending of combat troops to Vietnam, but once the war was commenced, he became one of the strongest supporters of the war. He enjoyed referring to himself as \\"The Granddaddy of the War Hawks.\\"Rivers, p. 164 He urged the President to use nuclear weapons against the North Vietnamese and to invade and occupy Hanoi.Rivers, p. 138 During an investigation of the My Lai Massacre, Rivers criticized Army helicopter pilot CW2 (later Major) Hugh Thompson, Jr. for giving the order to his men to fire upon American soldiers at My Lai if they continued to shoot unarmed Vietnamese civilians, calling him a traitor and saying he should be prosecuted. Rivers was unable to believe that American soldiers would do such a thing and publicly expressed doubt that any massacre ever happened. He attempted to protect the later-convicted perpetrator of My Lai, Army 2nd Lt. William Calley, by quickly holding hearings of his subcommittee on My Lai, calling every major witness to the event (including Thompson) before the subcommittee, and then refusing to release the transcripts of the testimony, so that military prosecutors would be prohibited from calling those persons as witnesses at Calley's court martial. =House Armed Services Chairman= L. Mendel Rivers at the White House, March 7, 1968 Rivers became the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in 1965 following the retirement of Carl Vinson. Upon moving into the Rayburn House Office Building, Rivers placed a plaque of Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution that specified the role of the legislative process with the military. He felt that the Congress should not delegate its powers to the President nor the Secretary of Defense and that a vigorous Congress would make the President perform his job better.Rivers p. 132 As Rivers inspected the committee room, he became incensed when he discovered cloakrooms adjoining the chamber for the Democratic and Republican Party members to discuss strategy. Rivers viewed national defense as a non-partisan issue and had the cloakrooms turned into offices. By the time Rivers became the chairman, he was well known for being a strong supporter of the American military in general, and of enlisted military service members in particular. In 1963 he established, through the vehicle of the House‚ÄìSenate Conference Committee, the principle of linking military retired pay to increases in the Consumer Price Index, similar to the practice for retired federal civil servants. In 1964 he championed the cause of \\"hospital rights,\\" guaranteeing medical care in military hospitals for military retirees and their dependents. After becoming chairman, he helped secure the first military pay raise since 1952 in 1965 despite opposition from the Secretary of Defense McNamara and President Johnson. Rivers was instrumental in establishing the additional enlisted pay grade of E-9, and he helped secure mobile home allowances and cheap air fares for soldiers returning from Viet Nam.Rivers p. 163 Rivers strongly supported the constant upgrading of US military preparedness, regardless of the cost. He supported making all US Navy ships nuclear powered,Rivers, pp. 137, 162 and he championed development of the US Air Force's C-5A Galaxy military airlift jet, despite huge cost overruns.Rivers, p. 161 In his last speech to his colleagues in the US House of Representatives on December 7, 1970, delivered just before he departed for Birmingham, Alabama to have heart surgery, he stated, \\"While we debate the question of maintaining our military capability, the Soviet Union forges ahead. We seem hell-bent on national suicide....We cannot as a nation afford to spend one penny less on national defense than that amount which is required to insure that you and I, and our children, can convince the Soviets they dare not pull the trigger when a Soviet gun is placed against our heads.\\"Rivers, p. 193 In that same speech, he delivered the quote for which he is best remembered: \\"The final measure of our ability to survive as a nation in a hostile world will not be how well we have managed our domestic resources and domestic programs, but whether or not we have avoided and frustrated the forces of evil which would draw us into the crucible of war with the Soviet Union. If we fail in that endeavor, we will have failed in everything.\\" Rivers died of heart failure in Birmingham, Alabama on December 28, 1970, 17 days after undergoing surgery to replace a leaking mitral valve at the University of Alabama Hospital. Almost two months earlier, he had been elected to a 16th term in Congress. He was buried at St. Stephen Episcopal Church Cemetery in St. Stephen, South Carolina. Personal life Rivers married Margaret Middleton (called Marguerite by Mendel, but Marwee by family and friends) on September 1, 1938. They had first met in 1930 at Camp Kanuga, near Hendersonville, North Carolina, where Mendel impressed Marwee by being elected Best Boy Camper, despite being 24 and a law school student.Ravenel, p. 20 The couple had three children: Peggy in 1939, Marion in 1943, and Mendel Jr. in 1947. Rivers was an Episcopalian, and a member of the Freemasons (Landmark Lodge No. 76, A.F.M.), the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and the Exchange Club. He was an enthusiast of boxing and was friends with both Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney.Ravenel, p. 180 He enjoyed playing baseball and he batted well over .300 in the Congressional Baseball Games. According to journalists, alcoholism plagued Rivers for much of his life. He was said to be the \\"binger\\" variety of alcoholic, one who is generally sober but relapses periodically. Washington syndicated columnist Drew Pearson called him a \\"security risk\\" and devoted eight pages to him in his 1968 book The Case Against Congress.Rivers, p. 174 Honors Rivers received numerous accolades and honors to commemorate his service to the nation and to the 1st congressional district. In 1948, a stretch of highway from the crossing of U.S. Route 78 over Meeting Street (known as the Five-Mile Viaduct) to where U.S. Route 52 meets the Berkeley County line was named as Rivers Avenue because Rivers was key in getting funds from Congress to pave it as the first four-lane road in North Charleston.Rivers, p. 85Ravenel, p. 123 The town of St. Stephen held a day-long celebration for Rivers in 1964 and named the secondary road that ran from St. Stephen's Episcopal Church to the house he grew up in as Mendel Rivers Road.Ravenel, p. 125 A seven-story office building located across Meeting Street from Marion Square was named the L. Mendel Rivers Federal Building in 1964 The building was vacated in 1999 following damage by Hurricane Floyd and it was purchased in January 2008 by a private developer (and it later became a hotel, The Dewberry). The L. Mendel Rivers Elementary School in Altus, Oklahoma was named for Rivers because he prevented the Altus Air Force Base from closing by making it the location of the training school for the C-5 Galaxy.L. Mendel Rivers Elementary School Website Rivers, p. 165Ravenel, p. 118 Charleston Southern University honored Rivers continual support of the institution by naming its college library as the L. Mendel Rivers Library in October 1970.CSU Library Homepage L. Mendel Rivers Library WebpageRavenel, p. 128 Rivers was admired by some soldiers who repaid his zealous support for them with adulation. They felt he was their congressman and referred to him as the \\"serviceman's best friend.\\"Rivers, pp. 159, 165 A road in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam was called the Mendel Rivers Parkway and the soldiers gave Rivers a captured Viet Cong carbine that he prominently displayed in his office. For obtaining drastically reduced air fares for soldiers on furlough, they gave him a cap with six stars and \\"The Big Boss\\" inscribed on it, indicating that Rivers outranked all military officials.Ravenel, p. 205 After his death, the Navy honored his dedication by naming the submarine USS L. Mendel Rivers (SSN-686) in his honor in 1971.Rivers, pp. 203‚Äì205Ravenel, pp. 163‚Äì164 His friends raised money create a small park and have a bust placed adjacent to the O.T. Wallace County Office Building in downtown Charleston.Ravenel, p. 129 Rivers was named as one the \\"Magnificent Ten Charlestonians Who Shaped the 20th Century\\" by Charleston Magazine in December 1999 for his efforts to expand the military in his district.Rivers, p. 207 See also *NASCAR National Commissioner *List of United States Congress members who died in office (1950‚Äì99) Notes References  External links  The Citadel Archives: L.

He was born in the area which is now Carmarthenshire and died at the battle of Brecon in April 1093. Family Rhys ap Tewdwr, a member of the House of Dinefwr, claimed the throne of Deheubarth following the death of his second cousin Rhys ab Owain, who was beheaded after the battle of Gwdig (modern day Goodwick) against Caradog ap Gruffydd in 1078. He was a grandson of Cadell ab Einion ab Owain ab Hywel Dda and a great-grandson of Einion ab Owain, thus a descendant of Hywel Dda, king of the Britons.A history of Wales from the earliest times to the Edwardian conquest, Volume 2 He married more than once, but only the name of his last wife, Gwladys ferch Rhiwallon daughter of Rhiwallon ap Cynfyn of the Mathrafal dynasty of Powys, is known. Issue by early alliances: * Goronwy (died 1103) * Hywel * Owain Issue by Gwladys ferch Rhiwallon: * Gruffydd * Gwenllian * Nest who married Gerald de Windsor, Constable of Pembroke, progenitors of the FitzGerald and de Barry dynasties of Ireland. These Hiberno-Norman, or Cambro- Norman, families have been Peers of Ireland since at least the 14th century. * Efa * Ardden. Rule St. David's Cathedral today In 1081 Caradog ap Gruffydd invaded Deheubarth and drove Rhys to seek sanctuary in the St David's Cathedral. Rhys, however, made an alliance with Gruffudd ap Cynan who was seeking to regain the throne of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, and at the Battle of Mynydd Carn in the same year they defeated and killed Caradog ap Gruffydd and his allies Trahaearn ap Caradog of Gwynedd and Meilyr ap Rhiwallon. The same year William the Conqueror visited Deheubarth, ostensibly on a pilgrimage to St David's, but with a major show of power as well, traversing the width of southern Wales, and it seems likely he came to an arrangement with Rhys, whereby Rhys paid him homage and was confirmed in possession of Deheubarth. Rhys paid William ¬£40 a year for his kingdom, ensuring good future relations with William that lasted until the end of William's lifetime. Rhys was content with the arrangement as it meant that he had to deal only with the jealousy of his fellow Welsh princes. In 1088 Cadwgan ap Bleddyn of Powys attacked Deheubarth and forced Rhys to flee to Ireland. However, Rhys returned later the same year with a fleet from Ireland and defeated the men of Powys, in a battle in which two of Cadwgan's brothers, Madog and Rhiryd, were killed. The Chronicle of the Princes claims that Cedifor ap Gollwyn, a man who traced his ancestry to the original kings of Dyfed (since the start of the previous century, the usual rulers of Deheubarth had descended from an invader, Cadell ap Rhodri)), commanded substantial authority in DyfedR. R. Davies, The Age of Conquest: Wales, 1063-1415, 2001, Oxford University Press, page 70. When Cedifor died in 1091, his sons demanded that Rhys surrender the throne to Gruffudd ap Maredudd, the son of a former king of Deheubarth (and the nephew of Rhys' predecessor)Dr. K. L. Maund, Ireland, Wales, and England in the Eleventh Century, 1991, page 149. This triggered a revolt, but Rhys was able to defeat the rebels in a battle at St. Dogmaels, killing Gruffudd. Death and succession Part of the Welsh version of Brut y Tywysogion found in the Red Book of Hergest Rhys was unable to withstand the increasing Norman pressure. The Welsh Bruts (chronicles) state that \\"Rhys ap Tewdwr, king of Deheubarth, was slain by the Frenchmen who were inhabiting Brycheiniog.\\" The Brut y Tywysogion adds \\"and with him fell the kingdom of the Britons.\\" This passage lends evidence to the belief that the conquest of Brycheiniog (Brecon), led by Bernard de Neufmarche, was mostly finished by Eastertide 1093. The battle of Brecon opened the way to the conquest of Deheubarth. The monastery and village of Penrhys in Rhondda Cynon Taff is said to be named for Rhys, as he was beheaded at the site by Norman forces. The village was originally named, Pen-Rhys ap Tewdwr (English: Rhys ap Tewdwr's Head). Upon Rhys's death, the Normans seized much of south Wales, and there was fighting over the spoils with the chieftains of Powys and Gwynedd. Eventually, Rhys's eldest son, Gruffydd, was allowed to inherit a small portion of his father's kingdom. Rhys's daughter Nest was briefly one of the numerous concubines of Henry I, to whom she bore a son, and thereafter the wife of Gerald FitzWalter of Pembroke; their sons and grandsons, the FitzGerald conquerors of Ireland, were known collectively as the \\"sons of Nest\\". Through his son Gruffydd, Rhys was an ancestor of the Tudor dynasty.

Kennedy attempted to take his infant off the maternity ward for some fresh air, which two nurses said was against hospital policy, and who claimed that he physically assaulted them when they tried to stop him from doing so. Kennedy was separately investigated by New York child welfare authorities following the incident, but social workers found no signs of child abuse in his home and declared the allegations unfounded in March 2012.

Upon meeting his future Oregon High School teammate Sherman Landers, he transferred to Oregon, Illinois, to continue training with him. Together, they began a rise that would take them to the 1920 Olympic Games. Although Loomis was an AAU champion in hurdles in 1917 and 1918 and in hurdles in 1920, the main favorite in Antwerpen was John Norton, who had run a new world record of 54.2 just two months before the Olympics. Despite that, Loomis won the 400 m hurdles final easily in a new world record of 54.0, beating Norton to second place by 0.6 seconds.

He founded the capoeira regional school, one of the art's two main branches. Early life Machado was born in Salvador in the year 1899 but was not officially registered until 1900, resulting in some confusion surrounding his date of birth. Despite him being born in 1899, 1900 is the date most commonly known and published. The son of Luiz C√¢ndido Machado and Maria Martinha do Bonfim, Machado was born at the Bairro do Engenho Velho, Salvador. The nickname \\"Bimba\\", whose literal meaning was \\"phallus\\", came up as a result of a bet between his mother and the midwife during his birth. His mother bet that he was going to be a girl and the midwife bet he would be a boy; after he was delivered, the midwife revealed that he was a boy by pointing between his legs at his bimba. In the context of Brazil, \\"Bimba\\" also meant \\"beating\\".‚ÄúI challenged all the tough guys‚Äù ‚Äì Mestre Bimba, 1973 He started learning capoeira when he was 12 years old, with a Capit√£o da Companhia Baiana de Navega√ß√£o (Navigation Captain) from Estrada das Boiadas (present day Bairro da Liberdade) in Salvador, called Bentinho, even though in those days capoeira was still being persecuted by the authorities. He would later be known as one of the legendary founding fathers of contemporary capoeira, (the other being Vicente Ferreira Pastinha, also known as Mestre Pastinha), the father of modern capoeira angola. Machado was a coal miner, carpenter, warehouse man, longshoreman, and horse coach conductor, but mainly a capoeirista.  Birth of the regional style  At 18, Bimba felt that capoeira had lost all its efficacy as a martial art and an instrument of resistance, becoming a folkloric activity reduced to nine movements. It was then that Bimba started to restore movements from the old capoeira (later known as Angola), added movements from an extinct African fighting style called batuque ‚Äì a type of martial art that he learned from his father (of which his father was a champion), as well as introducing movements created by himself. Bimba was the first to create a method of teaching to help facilitate learning because, until then, capoeira was only learned by watching and participating in the roda. This was the beginning of the development of capoeira regional. It also has been theorized that Bimba received influence by other martial arts when adding and perfecting movements to the capoeira repertoire. He is known to have studied the method of capoeira teachers like Mestre Sinhozinho, Mario Aleixo and Anibal \\"Zuma\\" Burlamaqui, who mixed capoeira with martial arts like judo, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling and Portuguese stick-fighting. Other sources, among them Mestre Itapoan, believe that Bimba made virtually no additions from other martial arts to capoeira, and that all its movements came from batuque or itself; moreover, there are reports of capoeira techniques similar to those from judo as far back as 1888, before Eastern martial arts came to Brazil. On the other hand, it is known that Bimba's student Cisnando Lima was trained in judo under Mitsuyo Maeda and Takeo Yano, and that other students sometimes faced Japanese martial artists in fights. In 1928, a new chapter in the history of capoeira began, as well as a change in the way black people were looked upon by the Brazilian society. After a performance at the palace of Bahia's Governor, Juracy Magalh√£es, Bimba was finally successful in convincing the authorities of the cultural value of capoeira, thus in the 1930s ending its official ban, which had been in effect since 1890.'' Machado founded the first capoeira school in 1932, the Academia- escola de Cultura Regional, at the Engenho de Brotas in Salvador, Bahia. Previously, capoeira was only practiced and played on the streets. However, capoeira was still heavily discriminated against by upper-class Brazilian society. In order to change the pejorative reputation of capoeira and its practitioners as devious, stealthy and malicious, Bimba set new standards to the art. His students had to wear a clean, white uniform, show proof of grade proficiency from school, exercise discipline, show good posture and many other standards. As a result, doctors, lawyers, politicians, upper-middle-class people, and women (until then excluded) started to join his school, providing Bimba with legitimacy and support. Bimba was not completely against accepting exceptionally poor students, but only when they showed talent or attitude.Gerard Taylor, Capoeira: The Jogo de Angola from Luanda to Cyberspace, Volumen 2 It's also known that Bimba tested his new students putting them in a strong gravata or neck lock for three minutes, only accepting them in his school if they endured said time without tapping out. However, after the entrance of his apprentice Cisnando Lima, he changed the initiation test to a demonstration of flexibility and a written examination.  Capoeira regional is established  In 1936, Bimba challenged fighters of any martial art style to test his regional style in a fight, which would be hosted under the boxing-like ruleset innovated by fellow capoeirista Anibal Burlamaqui. He had four matches, fighting against Henrique Bahia, V√≠tor Benedito Lopes, Am√©rico Ci√™ncia and fellow capoeira master Jos√© Cust√≥dio \\"Z√© I\\" dos Santos. Bimba won all matches, and received the nickname of \\"Tr√™s Pancadas\\" (\\"Three Hits\\"), meaning he only need three strikes at most to finish an opponent. Related to his challenges, Bimba had a famous rivalry with other mestres about whether it was valid or not to use hand strikes in the roda, especially after he finished an opponent named Vitor with a telefone or galopante. Machado's main detractor, L√∫cio \\"Barra Preta\\" de Tal, a police chief who had lost money with the result of the match, supposedly ambushed him on the Engenho Velho street in August 1936, carrying a gun and accompanied by six policemen armed with sabers. A scuffle broke out, only for Bimba to disarm and knock all the seven men senseless. According to Bimba, however, it wasn't properly an ambush: the policemen would be drunk and causing turmoil, and Bimba interfered in order to help a young boy they were attacking, starting the brawl only after receiving himself a saber attack that he had to employ his skill to dodge.Matthias R√∂hrig Assun√ß√£o, Capoeira: A History of an Afro- Brazilian Martial Art The newspaper A Tarde covered the incident under the title of \\"It's not easy to catch a capoerista! He defended himself using cabe√ßadas and rabos de arraia\\" (\\"N√£o √© f√°cil pegar um capoeirista... Livrou-se da agress√£o com cabe√ßadas e rabos de arraia\\"). On June 9, 1937, he earned the state board of education certificate and officially registered the 1st Capoeira center. Bimba's Capoeira Regional academy was geographically near Mestre Pastinha's Capoeira Angola school. While it is known that the two mestres respected each other and never talked bad about the other's school, according to mestres Atenilo and Itapoan, Bimba sometimes instructed his students to hit and injure Pastinha's in shared rodas.Nestor Capoeira, Capoeira: Roots of the Dance Fight Game In 1942, Machado opened his second school at the Terreiro de Jesus on Rua das Laranjeiras. The school is still open today and was supervised by his former student, \\"Vermelho\\" until the early 1980s. The school then came under the brief supervision of Mestre Almiro, before being transferred to Mestre Bamba; the man who leads the school today. He also taught capoeira to the army and at the police academy. He was then considered \\"the father of modern capoeira\\". In 1945, Bimba and his students were challenged by Jayme Ferreira, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitor trained by the Gracie family, who accused regional capoeristas of avoiding fights. Bimba answered by saying capoeira regional was for self-defense, not for fighting under sport rules. In 1949, the regional school toured Sao Paulo in order to show their art. However, their promoter would force them to work full exhibition matches (marmeladas, a word also used for professional wrestling), which Mestre Bimba didn't approve of. During this tour, they received two challenges to fight for real (pra valer), one by Brazilian catch wrestlers led by Piragibe and another one by capoeira carioca leader Mestre Sinhozinho. A two day event was held in Rio de Janeiro starting from April 2, pitting a team of capoeristas regionales against cariocas and catch wrestlers. Bimba's school lost all the matches by either submission or knockout, with the main event being with his student Jurandir being defeated by carioca Luiz \\"Cirandinha\\" Aguiar. The final part was held on April 7, getting a similar result with carioca Rudolf Hermanny winning over regionalista Fernando Perez. It's said Bimba was so impressed that he learned some movements he saw in the fight to absorb them into his own style. July 23, 1953 he was invited to demonstrate capoeira to the then president of Brazil, Get√∫lio Dorneles Vargas. Vargas says, \\"Capoeira is the only sport which was truly Brazilian.\\" Important names to Brazilian society at that time such as Dr. Joaquim de Ara√∫jo Lima (former governor of Guapor√©), Jaime Tavares, Rui Gouveia, Alberto Barreto, Jaime Machado, Delsimar Cavalvanti, C√©sar S√°, Decio Seabra, Jos√© Sisnando and many others were Bimba's students.  Legacy  Unhappy with false promises and lack of support from local authorities in Bahia, he moved to Goi√¢nia in 1973 at the invitation of a former student. He died a year later, on February 5, 1974 at the Hospital das Cl√≠nicas de Goi√¢nia because of a stroke. Bimba managed to recover the original values within capoeira, which were used amongst the black slaves centuries before him. For Bimba, capoeira was a fight but \\"competition\\" should be permanently avoided since he believed it was a \\"cooperation\\" fight, where the stronger player was always responsible for the weaker player and helped him to excel in his own fighting techniques. Machado fought all his life for what he strongly believed was best for capoeira and succeeded. After he died in 1974 one of his sons, \\"Nenel\\" (Manoel Nascimento Machado), at 14, took over his father's capoeira legacy. Nenel is still responsible for the remarkable cultural and historical legacy his father left him and is president of Filhos de Bimba School of Capoeira. Machado was posthumously awarded the title Honoris Causa by the Federal University of Bahia. = Bimba's academy rules = Bimba strongly believed capoeira had an extraordinary value as a self-defense martial art, hence his efforts to develop its learning in a structured and methodical way. Bimba developed a capoeira teaching method with commandments, principles and traditions, which are still part of the capoeira regional up to this day. Some of his commandments are: * To stop smoking and drinking since it interferes with the players' performance * Avoid demonstrating your progress to your friends outside the capoeira roda. Remember that surprise is your best ally in a fight * Avoid conversation during training, instead observe and learn from watching * Always ginga * Practice daily the basic fundamentals * Keep your body relaxed * It is better to get \\"caught\\" in the roda than on the streets * Don't be afraid to get close to the opponent. The closer you stay, the better you will learn * Students must maintain good grades in school or be employed Bimba also established his own capoeira principles as the basis for his capoeira teaching method: * Gingar sempre (to keep oneself in constant movement when fighting); ginga is the capoeira basic movement * Esquivar sempre (to dodge away from the opponent's attacks) * All movements must have a purpose (attack and corresponding defense movement) * Preserve a constant fixed position on the ground (acrobatic jumps makes one vulnerable) * Play according to the rhythm determined by the berimbau (capoeira musical instrument) * Always play close to your partner * Respect a player when he/she can no longer defend an attack movement * Protect the opponent's physical and moral integrity (during the practice, the stronger will protect the weaker player) Consequently, Bimba created several traditions and rituals to support his methodology: * A chair was used in order to train beginner students/players * The charanga is the capoeira orchestra, composed by a berimbau and two pandeiros * The singing (quadras e corridos), songs composed by Bimba to accompany the game * The batizado (baptism), the first time the student plays capoeira at the sound of berimbau The aspects that still makes capoeira regional unique is its method: * Admission exam (physical test made with capoeira movements to identify students' abilities) * The sequ√™ncia (sequence) of the basic 17 capoeira attack and defence movements * Practice of the different rhythms of the game * Specific movements: traumatizing, projection, connected and unbalancing * Practice of cintura desprezada (second sequence practice by advanced students) * Formatura (capoeira teacher graduation) * Especializa√ß√£o and emboscada (specific advanced exams) To celebrate his 119th birthday, Google released a Google Doodle commemorating him.

Food, Glycaemic Response and Health. ILSI Europe Concise Monograph Series 2011:1-30. Available from ILSI Europe. It is normal for blood glucose and insulin levels to rise after eating and then return again to fasting levels over a short period of time. This is particularly so after consumption of meals rich in certain carbohydrates. Glycemic management refers to the selection of foods to manage your blood sugar levels. Several tools have been developed to help quantify and communicate the effect of food on glycemic response. These include glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL) and glycemic glucose equivalents (GGE). A comparative glycemic response can also be determined, which compares the impact on blood glucose of one food to another based upon their total carbohydrate or total quantity. In 1981, the idea of classifying carbohydrates according to their Glycemic Index was first published. Since then, many studies have been undertaken to determine the impact of altering the blood glucose-raising potential (glycemic challenge) of the diet on a wide range of short- and long-term health outcomes. However, evaluating the impact of a single dietary change on health is notoriously complex, and opinions on the relevance of GI, GL and GGE have been divided. There are many different ways of lowering glycemic response, GI or GL, not all of which have the same effects on health. ILSI Europe published a monograph in November 2011 titled \\"Food, Glycaemic Response and Health\\", which concluded that \\"it is becoming evident that modifying the glycemic response of the diet should not be seen as a stand-alone strategy but rather as an element of an overall balanced diet and lifestyle\\". A low glycemic food will release glucose more slowly and steadily, which leads to lower postprandial (after meal) blood glucose readings. A high glycemic food causes a more rapid rise in blood glucose levels after meals. High glycemic foods are ideal for energy recovery after exercise or for a person experiencing hypoglycemia. The glycemic effect of foods depends on a number of factors such as the type of starch (amylose versus amylopectin), physical entrapment of the starch molecules within the food, fat and protein content of the food and organic acids or their salts in the meal ‚Äî adding vinegar, for example, will lower the glycemic response. The presence of fat or soluble dietary fiber can slow the gastric emptying rate, thus lowering the glycemic response. In general, foods with higher amounts of fiber and/or resistant starch have a lower glycemic response. While adding fat or protein will lower the glycemic response to a meal, the relative differences remain. That is, with or without additions, there is still a higher blood glucose curve after a high glycemic white bread than after a low gycemic bread such as pumpernickel. Unrefined wild plant foods like those available to contemporary foragers typically exhibit low glycemic indices.

Originally, the Aska was a version of GM's J-car produced by Isuzu, but later, after Isuzu pulled out of manufacturing passenger cars, the nameplate was applied to rebadged versions of the Subaru Legacy (1990 to 1993) and Honda Accord (1994 to 2002) sold through Isuzu's Japanese distribution network. The Aska replaced the Isuzu Florian in Isuzu's lineup and was discontinued in 2002 without a replacement, as Isuzu withdrew from the passenger car business completely. The name comes from the Japanese word, \\"Asuka\\", which is the old name of the Asuka Village in the Nara Prefecture of Japan. Because the name \\"Asuka\\" is likely to be mispronounced in foreign countries, the \\"u\\" was taken away from the name, presenting the model as the \\"Aska\\". __TOC__ First generation (1983-1989) The original Aska was developed as a part of GM's J-car program and was a replacement for Isuzu's dated Florian. In contrast to fellow J-cars from other GM divisions, the Aska only came in one body style, a four-door sedan (the station wagon body style on the Florian was always relatively unpopular). The Isuzu J-car variant differed most notably in the rear styling from other J-car variants. From 1983 to 1984, the Aska was known as the \\"Florian Aska\\", before being renamed simply \\"Aska\\" in 1985.The Oriental Economist Tanzan Ishibashi, 1983, page 19 The car was launched in March 1983 with carburetted 1.8 and 2.0 litre gasoline engines and a diesel, going on sale a month later. In August 1983 the Turbodiesel followed, with . In October 1983, a turbocharged and fuel injected version of the 2.0 litre engine, which developed 150 PS, joined the lineup as the LJ Turbo. In November 1985 a version branded by the German tuner Irmscher (specializing in Opels, they cooperated with Isuzu on some other models as well), this version featured a distinctive body kit and became somewhat of a cult object among some car fans in Japan. In September 1984 the innovative (but ultimately unsuccessful) semi-automatic NAVi5 system became available for the naturally-aspirated Aska 2.0. This was an automated manual transmission with an electronically-operated clutch, long before Alfa Romeo's Selespeed. In March 1985 the diesel also became available with the NAVi5 transmission, and from September 1986 the LG Turbodiesel was also available with it. The Aska underwent a very subtle facelift in July 1985, which was also when the \\"Florian\\" portion of the car's name was dropped. The first generation Aska was discontinued in March 1989; production totaled 108,512 cars. Isuzu did not have a contender in this segment for about a year's time until the second generation Aska was presented. =Export markets= =South America (Chile, Ecuador)= 1985 Chevrolet Aska 1.8 Limited (Chile) From 1984, the Aska was assembled in Arica, Chile from CKD kits and sold as Chevrolet Aska in the Chilean domestic market and in Ecuador. Chilean Askas came in three equipment levels (LT, Limited, and Deluxe), with two engines and either automatic or five-speed manual transmissions. While the two lesser versions both received a 1.8-litre coupled to the five-speed, the Deluxe got the larger 2-litre with , only fitted with the automatic transmission. =South-East Asia and New Zealand= The Aska was exported to Southeast Asia, where it was known as the Isuzu JJ,Singapore Business, Volume 8, Issues 1-6, Singapore Press Holdings, 1984, page 108 and to New Zealand as the Holden Camira (JJ) between 1984 and 1987, in lieu of the JD Camira, manufactured in Australia because the previous Australian-sourced JB Camira fared badly in the New Zealand market (nonetheless, the JD series wagon was imported concurrently from Australia). General Motors New Zealand switched back to the updated Australian version (JE) in 1987 due to the strengthening of Japanese Yen. In Indonesia, the two- liter version with was briefly sold as the \\"Holden Aska\\" alongside the 1.6-liter Camira.Tempo, Volume 15, Part 3, Badan Usaha Jaya Press Japansan Jaya Raya, 1985, page 59 Second generation (1990-1993) With the exception of the American market, the J platform did not continue into the 1990s. Not having the resources to develop a mid-size car on their own, Isuzu forged a short-lived alliance with Subaru. This provided for Isuzu to supply Subaru with Isuzu Bighorns (rebadged as the Subaru Bighorn), while Isuzu rebadged Subaru's mid-size Legacy sedan as the Isuzu Aska, beginning in June 1990. Both rebadged models were sold only in the Japanese market. There was also a Subaru Leone Van version briefly available, badged as the Isuzu Geminett II. The EJ series engine was offered in both 1.8 and 2.0 liter displacements. The engine has either single or double overhead camshaft architecture and pent-roof, cross flow cylinder firing chambers. The 2.0 liter fuel delivery was managed with sequential multiport fuel injection, and the 1.8 liter engine used a modified fuel delivery system with single point throttle body fuel injection called SPFI. The DOHC 2.0 liter non turbocharged engine had a dual stage intake manifold. The 2.0 liter vehicle came optional with Subaru's AWD system while the 1.8 came with FWD only. As with all other Askas, this was only ever available with four-door saloon bodywork. The Aska was discontinued in May 1993, as the Subaru deal came to an end. Third (1994-1997) and Fourth (1998-2002) generation Later, Isuzu entered a more substantial model- exchange alliance with Honda. Among other models, it encompassed the rebadging of the Honda Accord sedan as the Isuzu Aska. This lasted for two generations - thus the third generation Aska was the fifth generation Accord and the fourth was the sixth generation Accord sedan. The Aska remained a Japanese-only model and was discontinued in 2002.

He was simply way ahead of the curve\\".John J. Thompson, Raised by Wolves: The Story of Christian Rock & Roll (E.C.W., 2000):51.

I couldn't finish anybody's album. I couldn't get any work done in the office, it was just real hard. And I'd already done the one album for each artist that I'd promised, and I wanted to liberate them and get them signed up with a real big record company. But they all wanted to stay together because that was what they knew....I hadn't intended to produce any second albums for any of the artists. They were all out of contract. My contract wasn't really a contract to hold them to me. I had a contract with them because Word required it of Solid Rock. So, I just gave them their contract back as soon as their album was out. There was a lot of personal strife in everybody's life.

It was opened to the public as a museum in 1974. Ainola stands on the scenic shores of Lake Tuusulanj√§rvi in J√§rvenp√§√§, north of Helsinki, the Finnish capital. It was designed by the famous architect Lars Sonck. The only requests Sibelius had for Sonck were to include both a lakefront view and a green fireplace in the dining room. Water pipes were never installed until after Sibelius' death because he did not want the distraction while he was there composing. Its distance from the hustle and bustle of the nation's capital gave the composer the peace that he needed for his creative endeavours. His biographer Erik W. Tawaststjerna writes that \\"when Sibelius first left Helsinki, J√§rvenp√§√§ was to a large extent untouched countryside. Foals and sheep almost nosed their way into the house, and from time to time an elk majestically bestrode the grounds.\\" There were also other artistic families living in the neighborhood who provided a lively social circle for the Sibelius family. Daily life in Ainola was documented by Sibelius‚Äô private secretary Santeri Levas in the 1945 photographic book Jean Sibelius and His Home. Ainola's sauna was designed by Aino Sibelius. Buildings around Ainola include the sauna and the family's personal workshop. Sibelius died at Ainola on September 20, 1957; he is buried in a garden there. His wife Aino lived in Ainola for the next twelve years until she died on June 8, 1969. She is buried there with her husband. In 1972, Jean Sibelius' daughters Eva, Ruth, Katarina, Margareta, and Heidi, sold Ainola to the State of Finland. The Ministry of Education and the Sibelius Society of Finland opened it as a museum in June 1974. It is currently open from May to September. Among the personal effects remaining there are a Steinway grand piano, which was a gift to Sibelius on his fiftieth birthday in 1915, and paintings by Aino's brother Eero J√§rnefelt.

Etymology In Old English, hƒ´e was used as the third-person, personal pronoun (in the nominative and accusative case). It was gradually replaced by an Old Norse borrowing, √æeir (nominative plural masculine of the demonstrative, which acted in Old Norse as a plural pronoun), until it was entirely replaced in around the 15th century in Middle English. √ûeir, in turn, became they as it is known in Modern English today. √ûeir originates from Proto-Germanic *√æai-z (\\"those\\"), from Proto-Indo-European *toi (\\"those\\"). By the 18th century the use of \\"their\\" - as in the possessive pronoun - was at times interchangeable with the usage of \\"there\\". Literature from 1767 has the phrase \\"...also somewhat otherwise be deduced from their being necessary to support the Honour of God...\\" which was acceptable. However, by modern Standard English terms, the phrase shows an incorrect use of the possessive pronoun \\"their\\", i.e., their being. The appropriate spelling is there being. Word of the year In December 2019, Merriam-Webster chose \\"they\\" as word of the year for 2019. The word was chosen because \\"English famously lacks a gender-neutral singular pronoun to correspond neatly with singular pronouns like everyone or someone, and as a consequence they has been used for this purpose for over 600 years.\\" See also * English personal pronouns * Genderqueer * Generic antecedents * Object pronoun * Possessive pronoun * Spivak pronoun * Subject pronoun * Them References Gender-neutral pronouns ","title":"They"},{"id":"962807","text":"Lars Eliel Sonck (10 August 1870 ‚Äì 14 March 1956) was a Finnish architect. He graduated from Helsinki Polytechnic Institute in 1894 and immediately won a major design competition for a church in Turku, St Michael's Church, ahead of many established architects. The church was designed in the prevailing neo- Gothic style. However, Sonck's style would soon go through a dramatic change, in the direction of Art Nouveau and National Romanticism that was moving through Europe at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s, Sonck would also design a number of buildings in the emerging Nordic Classicism style. Architecture and town planning T√∂√∂l√∂ competition drawing, Helsinki, Lars Sonck, 1899. A prominent figure in Finland's search for architectural identity - at a period when Finland was a Grand Duchy under the control of Russia and Finnish politicians, intellectuals and artists were defining a distinct national identity - Sonck played a leading role in the development of National Romanticism, along with such other architects as Herman Gesellius, Armas Lindgren, and Eliel Saarinen. This style of architecture is often seen as part of the Art Nouveau style or Jugendstil, but shows influences from Romanesque architecture as well as elements borrowed from the historical tradition of Finland's medieval stone structures and residential wooden architecture. Among Sonck's well-known works in the neo-Romanesque style are Kallio Church, Helsinki (1912) and Kultaranta, the President of Finland's official summer residence in Naantali (1916); in the Jugendstil style are Tampere Cathedral, Tampere (1907) the Eira Hospital, Helsinki (1905) and \\"Ainola\\" (1903), the family home for the composer Jean Sibelius in J√§rvenp√§√§; in the Nordic Classicism style are the housing blocks on Museokatu Street, in T√∂√∂l√∂, Helsinki (c. 1920) and the Mikael Agricola Church, Helsinki (1935). Sonck was also active in city planning theory debate, between the picturesque theories of Austrian theorist Camillo Sitte versus fellow Austrian Otto Wagner. Sonck favoured the former approach. The debate came to a head in Finland in the first ever town planning design competition in 1898-1900 for the T√∂√∂l√∂ district of Helsinki. Three entries were lifted out for recognition; first prize to Gustaf Nystr√∂m, second prize to Lars Sonck, and third prize to a joint entry by Sonck, Bertil Jung and Valter Thom√©. A fantastic sketch accompanying Sonck's competition entry gives an indication of the imagery he was aiming for, inspired by his travels in Germany. Historian Pekka Korvenmaa makes the point that leading theme was the creation of the atmosphere of medieval urban environments - and Sonck later designed a similar proposal in 1904 to rearrange the immediate surroundings of St.Michael's Church in Helsinki, with numerous \\"fantastic\\" spired buildings.Pekka Korvenmaa, Innovation versus Tradition: The Architect Lars Sonck - Works and Projects 1900-1900, Suomen muinaismuistoyhdistyksen aikakauskirja, Helsinki, 1991, p.41. In the T√∂√∂l√∂ competition, undecided what course of action to take, however, the City Council asked the prize-winners to submit new proposals. When this led to further stalemate Nystr√∂m and Sonck were commissioned to work together on the final plan combining Nystr√∂m's spacious street network and elements of Sonck's Sittesque details. The final plan (1916) under the direction of Jung, made the scheme more uniform, while the architecture is seen as typical of the Nordic Classicism style.

The ship is grounded in the Hackensack River at the former location of the defunct New Jersey Naval Museum in Hackensack, New Jersey. It is inaccessible to the public.https://www.courier- journal.com/story/news/local/2019/11/15/wwii-submarine-may-coming-louisville- museum-piece/2574247001/ History Ling was laid down 2 November 1942 by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company of Philadelphia. She was launched 15 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. E. J. Foy, and was moved to the Boston Navy Yard for completion and testing. Ling was commissioned on 8 June 1945, with Commander George Garvie Molumphy in command. After shakedown and further installations, Ling headed out to sea to test her equipment 15 September 1945. The submarine based at Naval Submarine Base New London in Connecticut until she sailed 11 February 1946 for the Panama Canal Zone, arriving eight days later. She operated out of Panama until 9 March when she sailed north. She completed inactivation 23 October at New London, decommissioned 26 October 1946, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. In March 1960, Ling was towed to Brooklyn, New York, where she was converted into a training ship at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, simulating all aspects of submarine operations. She was reclassified an Auxiliary Submarine (AGSS-297) in 1962. Ling received one battle star for World War II service. Ling was reclassified a Miscellaneous Unclassified Submarine (IXSS-297), and struck from the Naval Register, 1 December 1971. Museum ship Six months later the old 297 was donated to the Submarine Memorial Association, a non-profit organization formed in 1972 with the purpose of saving Ling from the scrap yard. They petitioned the Navy to bring the boat to Hackensack, New Jersey to serve as a memorial \\"to perpetuate the memory of our shipmates who gave their lives in the pursuit of their duties while serving their country.\\" Many citizens and corporations contributed time, professional services, and funds toward the restoration of Ling. She arrived at her present home in New Jersey in January 1973, where she was restored to near-mint condition‚Äîscrubbed, painted, and polished for public tours‚Äîthrough the efforts of the association. The compartments were refurbished and outfitted with authentic gear that recreated the bygone era of the World War II battle submarine. She was the centerpiece of the New Jersey Naval Museum at 78 River St., Hackensack, New Jersey. X-rays showed that the submarine's five safes contained documents and metallic objects, but the combinations had long been lost. On 27 January 2006, Jeff Sitar, the eight-time world champion locksmith, opened the safes using only his fingers and an electronic sound amplifier, rather than drills or explosives. In the safes, he found a wide variety of objects, including a dozen pennies, two .45-caliber bullets, a ring of keys, many training and maintenance manuals and parts catalogs from the 1940s and 1950s, and two cans of 190-proof ethanol. (Despite the inevitable jokes that it was the private stash of the yeoman, the alcohol would have been used for cleaning electrical contacts.)Jeff Sitar and Basil Kio speak about opening five safes on a World War II submarine, LexisNexis transcript of The Today Show, 28 January 2006 In the American-produced Russian language film Katya shot in 2010, the Ling was used for a set to depict the Soviet K-129 diesel-electric powered submarine which sank on 8 March 1968 northwest of Oahu. Site From 1972 until the closing of the New Jersey Naval Museum, the Museum had paid one dollar per year to rent its riverside site for Ling. In January 2007, the North Jersey Media Group, owner of the site, informed the museum that the site was going to be sold for redevelopment within the year and that the museum and submarine would need to be relocated.Holl, John. \\"Retired Submarine, 63, Seeks Loving New Home\\", The New York Times, 11 February 2007. Accessed 21 October 2007. As of September 2013 the museum itself was closed due to damage in 2012 from Hurricane Sandy. The museum closed again for emergency repairs in late July, 2015. The museum was expected to vacate the property in August 2018. However, on August 14, 2018, vandals stole four plaques from the ship, and flooded it with several feet of water. It was unknown if it would be salvageable. Separately, five vandals broke into the submarine and stole two artifacts.. Freshwater flow in the Hackensack River has been drastically reduced for use as drinking water by the Oradell Dam. The navigable ship channel on the river has only been maintained as far north as the Riverbend in Hudson County. The accumulation of silt has effectively filled in the formerly navigable channel. The present depth of the Hackensack River is too shallow to allow the Ling to move downstream, and there are no funds or plans to dredge the river, the muds of which are laced with industrial toxins. The Ling therefore can not be moved from its location. There are four bridges across the Hackensack River, south of the Ling,NOAA Chart 12337, Passaic and Hackensack Rivers that do not open or move. Two are vehicular bridges. Two are rail bridges, one operated by New Jersey Transit and one operated by both New Jersey Transit and Amtrak. These bridges also make moving the submarine downriver impossible.

Lars Pedersen Lars Pedersen was born in 1961, in Oslo, Norway. His father, Tore Pedersen, was a Norwegian musical composer. At an early age, the younger Pedersen performed with his four older sisters and older brother; they were often compared to the Jackson 5 and The Partridge Family, popular bands of the time. Being in the spotlight at a young age, Pedersen met Chuck Berry and other stars. In the late 1970s Pedersen played in H√¶rverk, one of the first Norwegian punk bands, and later ‚Äì as the 1980s arrived ‚Äì went on to form the band The Last James. The Last James explored The Beatles/Beach Boys sound, releasing three albums, Grape, The Last James and Kindergarten. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Pedersen was also a member of the renowned experimental/industrial/new wave group Holy Toy, together with Andrej D. Nebb. The band became active again in 2011. Early releases In 1983 Pedersen launched the one-man project Hospital Blimp, which would later become When. The debut album Drowning but Learning, was released in 1987, with When's trademark collage/cut-up technique already apparent. In 1988 When released Death in the Blue Lake, inspired by Norwegian author Andr√© Bjerke's psychological horror novel of the same name. The album had a strong atmosphere of fear and mourning, and was quite popular in Norwegian black metal circles. An excerpt from the album's A-side was commissioned as an intro to Satyricon's Dark Medieval Times \\"Walk the path of sorrows\\". The B-side of the album is an amalgamation of ethnic music, blues harmonica, coughing, psychedelic pop and glissandi effects. Today it is almost impossible to track down a copy of the album. Black, White & Grey, When's third album, conjured up images of war and urban decay. Chris Cutler (Henry Cow, Art Bears, etc.), who contributed to the album, was also a central inspiration. The album was released on Cutler's R√©R Megacorp in 1990. 1992 saw the release of Svartedauen (Norwegian for \\"The Black Death\\"), a 38-minute musical description of the ravages of the bubonic plague in Norway around 1349. The album borrows elements from Norwegian folk music, and features a host of disturbing sounds: hearses, moans of the dying, rats, flagellants' whips and a scythe being sharpened, to name but a few. On 1994's Prefab Wreckage, When slowly started moving from the more abstract soundtracks of the earlier albums and towards a more song-oriented sound. The inner sleeve is a painting by Hieronymus Bosch, one of the album's inspirations. In 1997 When released Gynt, which according to the liner notes is a \\"satiric play on Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt. Inspired by Henrik Ibsen.\\" As Pedersen says: \\"I tried to put irony into the music. There is a lot of humour in When's music, it's not bloody serious all the time.\\" Jester Records After Gynt, When was signed by Jester Records, newly set-up by Kristoffer Garm Rygg of Ulver, and the next album would mark another radical change in When's musical direction. Psychedelic Wunderbaum was indeed a psychedelic mix, with apparent inspirations from rock, noise, and cartoon music, and with lyrics taken from Aleister Crowley and Tom Wolfe. Pedersen remarked: :I fetched many grooves from old, obscure psychedelic garage bands. It was something I had wanted to do for a long time, but I thought that it might be too audacious. But as more and more artists seem to be using that method, I figured that I could do it too. I dug up the old Farfisa organ that I had used in Holy Toy and got Bj√∏rn Sorknes, the old Holy Toy guitarist, with me. We worked together on the production as well. It became a sort of crossing between industrial and psychedelic rock. The next album, The Lobster Boys, was Pedersen's most pop- oriented effort so far. Many of the songs were reminiscent of The Beach Boys and/or The Beatles, but there's always something just a little \\"off\\" and odd about When's music that sets it apart from more mainstream acts. Some tracks start out as \\"normal\\" rock, but often end up in a cacophony of weird samples and madness before reaching an end. The Lobster Boys was also heavily inspired by Arabic music. Nils Arne √òverg√•rd and √òyvind Borgemoen joined When as full members on this recording. The trio has played several concerts, including the release party for the single \\"Sunshine Superhead\\", where they performed in bear costumes with paper-m√¢ch√© guitars. The same song also got heavy radio rotation in Norway that summer. In 2003 When released Pearl-Harvest, more or less The Lobster Boys part II, but with lyrical concepts taken from The Arabian Nights. Combine those fables with sampled, shambling Middle Eastern bazaar muzak, jangling exotica and electronics, and you've got When's winning formula. When's 2004 album Whenever features a characteristic mix of Middle Eastern influences, African tribal rhythms, as well as trademark When collages and cartoon loops. The lyrics, written by Chris Cutler, often deal with grim subject matter such as the apocalypse and death. In 2007, When released their latest album, \\"Trippy Happy\\". Bringing back a sound that hasn't been heard since the late 60s, Trippy Happy explored folky pop ballads, banjo lullabies, baroque psychedelia, and industrial cartoon surrealism. The album was a return to the sound of The Last James, as it featured appearances by Haakon Ellingsen of the Last James on banjo, voices, and piano and √òyvind Borgemoen on accordion/piano. On February 17, 2008, When announced the forthcoming release of their twelfth album, You Are Silent, for April 28, 2008. The announcement suggests that the sound is darker and closer to Prefab Wreckage than to recent releases.

The act which precipitates takfir is termed mukaffir. Contemporary formulation and usage of the term have their roots in the 20th-century Islamist theorist Sayyid Qutb's advocacy of \\"takfirism\\" (doctrine of excommunication) against the state or society deemed jahiliyah (state of ignorance and disbelief). According to Qutb, violence is required to be sanctioned against corrupt state leaders, on the premise that quietism is not the Islamic prescription against those deemed to be apostates. This position is widely held and applied by jihadist organizations to varying degrees. At the same time, the concept is opposed by religious establishment as an ostensible reason for violence.Karawan, Ibrahim A. (1995). \\"Takfƒ´r\\". In John L. Esposito. The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World. Oxford: Oxford University Press. They hold that excommunication against those who profess their Islamic faith is not sanctioned by Islam, or an ill-founded takfir accusation is a major forbidden act (haram) in Islamic jurisprudence. It has to be noted that Shiraz Maher does specify that the major Salafi jihadist theorists like Abu Hamza al-Masri, Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, Omar Abdel-Rahman, and Abu Basir al-Tartusi ask to exercise caution while doing takfir, as declaring a Muslim unbeliever wrongly makes the one who accuses to himself get out of the religion of Islam and become an apostate himself.Shiraz Maher, Salafi-Jihadism: The History of an Idea, Penguin UK (2017), p. 75  Authority and conditions  Legitimate authority and conditions that permit the issuance of takfir are major points of contention among Muslim scholars. In general, the official clergy considers that Islam does not sanction excommunication of Muslims who profess their Islamic faith and perform the ritual pillars of Islam. This is due to takfir having major consequences of killing, confiscation of their property and denial of Islamic burial. Ulamas often raise objections by asking rhetorical questions of who holds the right to excommunicate others, on what religious criteria it should be based, and what level of specialized knowledge in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) is required for the qualification of authority. Some Muslims consider takfir to be a prerogative of either the Prophet ‚Äî who does that through Divine revelation ‚Äî or the state which represents the collectivity of the Ummah (the whole Muslim community). The declaration of takfir may be made if the alleged Muslim declares himself a kafir, but more typically applies to a judgement that an action or statement by the alleged Muslim indicates his knowing abandonment of Islam. In many cases an Islamic court or a religious leader, an alim must pronounce a fatwa (legal judgement) of takfir against an individual or group. There are disputes among different schools of religious thought as to what constitutes sufficient justification for declaring takfir: = Sunni Ashari = The orthodox Sunni position is that sins generally do not prove that someone is not a Muslim, but denials of fundamental religious principles do. Thus a murderer, for instance, may still be a Muslim, but someone who denies that murder is a sin is a kafir if he is aware that murder is considered a sin in Islam. = Murjites = Murji'ah emerged as a theological school that was opposed to the Kharijites on questions related to early controversies regarding sin and definitions of what is a true Muslim., 5: 555-556; 7: 195-205; 7: 223 As opposed to the Kharijites, Murjites advocated the idea of deferred judgement of peoples' belief. The word Murjiah itself means \\"one who postpones\\" in Arabic. Murjite doctrine held that only God has the authority to judge who is a true Muslim and who is not, and that Muslims should consider all other Muslims as part of the community.Isutzu, Concept of Belief, p. 55-56. This theology promoted tolerance of Umayyads and converts to Islam who appeared half-hearted in their obedience.Isutzu, Concept of Belief, p. 55. = Mu'tazilites = The Mu'tazilites (followed by the Zaidiyyahs) advocated what they saw as a middle way, whereby grave sinners were categorized neither as believers nor as kafirs. = Khawarij = Some of the early medieval Kharijites concluded that any Muslim who sinned ceased to be a Muslim, while others concluded that only major sin could cause that. History Some Muslims (such as Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, founder of Wahhabism) believe that one of the earliest examples of takfir was alleged to have been practised by the first Caliph, Abu Bakr. In response to the refusal of certain Arab tribes to pay the alms-tax (zakat), he is reported to have said: \\"By God, I will fight anyone who differentiates between the prayer and the zakat. ... Revelation has been discontinued, the Shari'ah has been completed: will the religion be curtailed while I am alive. ... I will fight these tribes even if they refuse to give a halter. Poor-due (zakat) is a levy on wealth and, by God, I will fight him who differentiates between the prayer and poor-due.\\" Abu Bakr did not use the word kafir though. Status of Jihad (English translation). A letter from Abu Mus'ab to Abu Mohammed relating a meeting with Abu Musab Zarqawi. The author and Zaraqawi agree that the Muslims fighting in Bosnia, Tajikistan, Chechnya, and Kashmir are polytheists and supporters of secular democracy, and that the Taliban are a front for Pakistan. Zarqawi tells Abu Mus‚Äôab that he is accused of Takfir because of his views about the Muslims in Bosnia, Tajikistan, Chechnya, and Kashmir. In the wars between the Umayyad Caliphate and the Khawarijs, the latter's practice of takfir became the justification for their indiscriminate attacks on civilian Muslims; the more moderate Sunni view of takfir developed partly in response to this conflict. Ibn Taymiyyah, the 14th century scholar followed by many modern Salafi, ruled that though Mongol invaders professed to be Muslims their enforcement of the Yasa law in place of Islamic Shariah \\"reversed their conversion, rendering the Mongols apostate.\\" 18th century revivalist Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab cited Ibn Taymiyyah in his preaching that many mainstream Muslim traditions (such as Sufism) as bid'a (innovation of the religion) caused self-professed Muslims to be unbelievers and his followers slew many Muslims for allegedly kufr practises. =After 1950= Takfir has become \\"a central ideology of militant groups\\" such as those in Egypt, \\"which reflect the ideas\\" of Sayyid Qutb, Abul A'la Maududi and others, according to the Oxford Islamic Studies Online website.Compare: Leaders such as Hasan al- Hudaybi (d. 1977) and Yusuf al-Qaradawi reject takfir as un-Islamic and marked by bigotry and zealotry. It is rejected by Islamic scholars and leaders such as Hasan al-Hudaybi (d. 1977) and Yusuf al-Qaradawi and by mainstream Muslims and Islamist groups.  In Pakistan  Takfir has been used against the Ahmadiyya, who describe themselves as Muslims but who many Muslims and Islamic scholars believe reject the doctrine of Khatam an-Nabiyyin, i.e. the belief that Muhammad was the last and final Prophet and Messenger of God, after whom there can be no other Prophet or Messenger. In 1974 Pakistan amended its constitution to declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims. In 1984, General Muhammad Zia- ul-Haq, the then military ruler of Pakistan, issued Ordinance XX,The presentation before the parliament: Sarai Reader 2005: Bare Acts. p. 178. forbidding Ahmadis to call themselves Muslim. As a result, they are not allowed to profess the Islamic creed publicly or to call their places of worship mosques,Heiner Bielefeldt: \\"Muslim Voices in the Human Rights Debate\\", Human rights quarterly, 1995 vol. 17 no. 4 p. 587. to worship in non-Ahmadi mosques or public prayer-rooms, to perform the Muslim call to prayer, to use the traditional Islamic greeting in public, to publicly quote from the Quran, to preach in public, to seek converts, or to produce, publish, and disseminate their religious materials. Local ulama (Islamic scholars) have declared takfir on another group in Pakistan, the Zikri of Makran in Balochistan. The Zikri believe that Syed Muhammad Jaunpuri (born in 1443) was the Mahdi (redeemer) of Islam. In 1978 the ulama founded a movement (Tehrik Khatm-e-Nabuat) to have the Pakistan state declare the Zikris as non-Muslims, like the Ahmadis.  Salman Rushdie  The case of Salman Rushdie provides an example of takfir that featured prominently in Western media. Rushdie went into hiding after Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, officially declaring him a kafir who should be executed for his book The Satanic Verses, which is perceived to contain passages that draw into question the basis of Islam. Similar cases have occurred in Egypt: for example, Nasr Abu Zayd was accused of apostasy following his work on Islamic sources, describing the Qur'an as a historical document.Susanne Olsson, \\"Apostasy in Egypt: contemporary cases of hisbah\\" i The Muslim World, Volym 98:1, 2008.  GIA in Algeria  During the Algerian Civil War of 1991-2002 the Islamist insurgent group the GIA (Armed Islamic Group of Algeria) under amir Antar Zouabri issued a manifesto in 1996 entitled The Sharp Sword, presenting Algerian society as resistant to jihad and lamented that the majority of Algerians had \\"forsaken religion and renounced the battle against its enemies\\". Zouabri at first took care to deny that the GIA had ever declared takfir on Algerian society itself.Al seif al battar, p.39-40 But during the month of Ramadan (January‚ÄìFebruary 1997) hundreds of civilians were killed in massacres, some with their throats cut. The massacres continued for months and culminated in August and September when hundreds of men women and children were killed in the villages of Rais, Bentalha and Beni Messous. Pregnant women were sliced open, children were hacked to pieces or dashed against walls, men's limbs were hacked off one by one, and, as the attackers retreated, they would kidnap young women to keep as sex slaves. The GIA issued a communiqu√© signed by Zouabri claiming responsibility for the massacres and justifying them‚Äîin contradiction to his manifesto‚Äîby declaring impious (takfir) all those Algerians who had not joined its ranks.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.272-3 While the GIA had been the \\"undisputed principal Islamist force\\" in Algeria two years earlier,Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.265 the slaughters drained it of popular support and led to the end of \\"organized jihad\\" in Algeria. (The issue became complicated by evidence that security forces cooperated with the killers in preventing civilians from escaping, and may even have controlled the GIA.)  Tunisia  The constitution of Tunisia (passed after the Tunisian Revolution of 2011), criminalized takfir by placing a ban on fatwas that promote takfir.  Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant  The Islamic State has been heavily criticized for applying takfir to Muslims who oppose its rule. According to journalist Graeme Wood in mid-2015, > Following takfiri doctrine, the Islamic State is committed to purifying the > world by killing vast numbers of people. The lack of objective reporting > from its territory makes the true extent of the slaughter unknowable, but > social-media posts from the region suggest that individual executions happen > more or less continually, and mass executions every few weeks. The tendency of the group to target Shia Muslims with suicide bombings has been credited to the fact that the group considers them apostates.

Williams. History Earle E. Williams, a minister of youth and music director in the Los Angeles area, decided to start a religious music record label in 1944 as a solution to the problem of obtaining the records he needed for his work, which included broadcasting a weekly half-hour radio program every Sunday at noon on local station KXLA. In a 1947 interview, Williams described to United Press International (UPI), \\"I sold my car, ray dog, my wife's spinet, a camera and a renovated church organ and borrowed the rest on a note to get the $3,000 I had to have to start production. Based in Los Angeles, Sacred Records recorded and published religious music. The label merged with Kansas City's White Church Records in 1949, and by the following year the company had opened new offices in Kansas City, Philadelphia, and New York. Composer and arranger Ralph Carmichael convinced the label to finance Rhapsody in Sacred Music (1958), an instrumental album that featured a full symphony, including four trumpets, four trombones, multiple french horns, woodwinds, a string section of at least 12 violins and four viola, two bass harps, and percussion. \\"It was the first all-instrumental sacred music recording with that size orchestra\\", Carmichael said. \\"It was a scary experiment and I nearly broke the record company.\\" Sacred Records was acquired by Word Records in 1963. Williams remained with Word as a salesman and distributor.

Its mission was dedicated to the state's Navy heritage and naval history in general. The prominent element in the collection was the USS Ling (SS-297), a long Balao- class submarine of World War II. The museum land has since been sold for redevelopment, however the USS Ling remains grounded in the river, with an uncertain future. Efforts have been made since 2007 to find a new home for the Ling. In 2019, the Louisville Naval Museum began a campaign to attempt to relocate the ship to the Ohio River.https://www.courier- journal.com/story/news/local/2019/11/15/wwii-submarine-may-coming-louisville- museum-piece/2574247001/ From 1972 until closing, the Museum had paid one dollar per year to rent its riverside site. In January 2007, the North Jersey Media Group, owner of the site, informed the museum that the site was going to be sold for redevelopment within the year and that the museum and submarine would need to be relocated.Holl, John. \\"Retired Submarine, 63, Seeks Loving New Home\\", The New York Times, February 11, 2007.

The weaponry on the Ling includes twenty-four torpedoes and one 4\\" deck gun (it originally had two 5\\" deck guns) for handling military targets too small to warrant the expenditure of a torpedo. Volunteers maintained Japanese Kaiten IIs, a World War II Japanese suicide torpedo; a German Seehund, a World War II German two-man coastal defense submarine; and A Vietnam War-era Patrol Boat, River (PBR), all of which the US Navy has since reclaimed, in addition to Ling and some torpedoes, missiles, and artillery shells. The onshore museum building contained a number of different and unique items ranging from a United States Navy SEALs delivery vehicle to personal photographs and effects. Closing After Hurricane Sandy the gangway was destroyed, leading to the closure of the sub and museum. Furthermore, the area was selected for a development project. The Naval History and Heritage Command has taken several artifacts after they were in a state of disrepair; with the remaining artifacts being housed by Harbor Freight. Vandalism and Burglary In September 2018, artifacts from the submarine were stolen, and the Ling was also flooded. Several people have been identified in connection with the burglary.

Its nearest town is East Grinstead, which lies approximately west from the village. The village is situated on the High Weald, on the East Sussex-West Sussex-Kent-Surrey border. History =Early history= The village's name is derived from connections to the Wealden iron industry, and a reference to the hammer used in the furnace of the iron forge. A Romano- British iron bloomery (now listed as a site of historic interest) was located near the ponds to the south-east of where the modern village ‚Äì which did not exist at the time ‚Äì is located, and a blast furnace existed on another site nearby from at least the 1500s. Areas of nearby woodland are similarly named, including Hammer Wood, Cansiron Wood and Cinder Wood. The settlement was, for several centuries, the central part of an estate known as The Bower, and is believed to have comprised part of a medieval deer park. =Development= In 1792, a site to the south-east of the nucleus of the current settlement was selected by architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and his commissioner, John Sperling, as the location on which they would build Hammerwood Park, a country house which was one of the first examples of Greek Revival architecture in Great Britain (it was Sperling who originally coined the name 'Hammerwood'). Many of the buildings which form part of Hammerwood today were constructed in the 19th century as tied cottages to support the Hammerwood estate, which at that time consisted of 2,500 acres; Oswald Augustus Smith provided in 1864 for a Hammerwood Cricket Club; in 1873 for a village school for 100 children; in 1875 for the Vicarage, and in 1880 for St Stephen's Church, Hammerwood ‚Äì to the design of E. P. Loftus Brock ‚Äì at the cost of ¬£7,431 (the first vicar being Rev. Clement Colby Woodland of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge), as well as for a number of other buildings in Holtye and East Grinstead. On 9 July 1880, an ecclesiastical parish of Hammerwood was duly formed from portions of those of East Grinstead and Hartfield. The population of Hammerwood reached a peak of 438 in 1891. St Stephen's Church contains a two manual pipe organ, built by the firm of T. C. Lewis. =20th century= Hammerwood Park The Hammerwood estate entered a period of decline after the First World War, and much of the village was sold off. In 1930, the owner of Hammerwood Park at that time (a Lt. Col. Pollen) provided for a Hammerwood and Holtye Village Hall, next to the Vicarage. There was also a Hammerwood and Holtye Women's Institute, and a Hammerwood and Holtye Men's Club (both ceased to exist in the 1980s). The Hammerwood County Primary School closed in 1959, and the ecclesiastical parish of Hammerwood was united with that of St Mary Magdalene, Cowden in June 1977.East Sussex Record Office During the Second World War, on 2 March 1944 a Heinkel He 177 of the Luftwaffe's Kampfgeschwader 100 on a bombing mission to London was shot down over Hammerwood by a Mosquito Mk XIII of No. 151 Squadron RAF at 3:15 am. Six were on board the German aircraft; four survived, and wreckage was scattered widely in nearby woodland. Hammerwood Park was requisitioned for use by the armed forces during that war, becoming home to 200 soldiers (including the cricketer Denis Compton, and a contingent from the Canadian Army). From November 1943, No. 660 Squadron RAF operated from an unpaved airstrip (RAF Hammerwood) to the east of the village, from which the SOE flew Westland Lysanders for a time. Flying ceased by July 1944. On 29 August 1944, a V-1 flying bomb which had been shot down by an aircraft came down in the village. After the war, Hammerwood Park was divided into flats and the remnants of the estate were purchased by Led Zeppelin. It subsequently became derelict, before being purchased by the current owner in 1982. A programme of rolling restoration continues. Hammerwood today The village now sits in the High Weald AONB, and development is thus strictly limited. The structure of the settlement, set along a lane from the A264, has remained unchanged for more than a century. Now more than 150 years old, Hammerwood Cricket Club continues to play friendly games on Sundays throughout the summer. It won the Hartfield Tournament in 1984. Hammerwood Park has been open to the public since 1983; tours take place at least twice weekly in summer, and musical events are held regularly. There is a Scout campsite at Hammerwood owned and operated by the Lewisham North District Scouts. St Stephen's Church held its last service on 20 March 2016 (Palm Sunday), and the parish (which encompassed the villages of Hammerwood and Holtye) was dissolved later that year. That part of the former parish in Hammerwood were transferred to the parish of Forest Row and Ashurst Wood, whilst parts of the parish in Holtye were transferred to the parish of Hartfield. In November 2016, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport decided to upgrade the Listing for St Stephen's Church to grade II* due to its architectural merit, preservation and connection to the historic estate. Additionally, the 1879 decorated gothic lych gate and church walls were newly listed at grade II. For a settlement of its size, Hammerwood thus has an unusual number of buildings of historic and architectural interest. The Bower House, a 15th-century timber-framed farmhouse, is listed at grade II*, its cottages at grade II, the Old School House, Brooklands, and Great Cansiron Farm at grade II, and Hammerwood Park at grade I. Geography Transport Much of the settlement is set along a lane running south from the A264, which links the hamlet to East Grinstead, Tunbridge Wells and beyond. Gatwick Airport is from the village, whilst Redhill Aerodrome and Biggin Hill Airport are both within half an hour's drive. Hammerwood Park has a registered unlicensed helicopter landing site for visiting pilots.

He is easily recognizable due to his trademark afro, from which his pseudonym is derived. Afrob in the year 2005  Biography  Afrob was born in Venice, Italy to Eritrean parents but moved to Germany at a young age. He grew up in the German city of Stuttgart, which is where he started his rap career. In 1994, Afrob began his rap carrier as a featured artist for befriended rap crews such as the Massiven T√∂ne, Freundeskreis (FK), and the Spezializtz. Afrob's also gained early fame from his collaboration with Stuttgart Posses such as ‚ÄúDie Kolchose‚Äù and ‚ÄúFK Allstars‚Äù (et al. with Max Herre, Joy Denalane, Gentleman, and S√©kou). It was not until 1999 that he released his first solo album, Rolle mit Hip Hop. Rolle mit Hip Hop was distributed by Four Music and featured collaborations with the Kolchose, and the album peaked at spot 13 on the German album charts. The same year, Afrob released the single ‚ÄúReimemonster‚Äù (\\"rhyme monsters\\") which featured Hamburg City rapper Ferris MC. For this single, Afrob worked together primarily with musicians from Stuttgart (e.g. Wasi, DJ Friction, and Max Herre). Today, \\"Reimemonster\\" is still widely regarded as a German hip hop classic. In May of 1999, Afrob arranged a tour with Freundeskreis, and in the fall of 1999, he toured with the Fantastischen Vier throughout Germany. At the end of 1999, together with Flavor Flav from Public Enemy and MC Rene, he rapped the song 1, 2, 3, Rhymes Galore on the single by DJ Tomekk and Grandmaster Flash, which placed 6th in the German charts. His second album, Made in Germany, was released in 2001 by Four Music. The album was less successful, despite featuring acts like Gentleman, Wasi from Massive T√∂ne, Max Herre, and Joy Denalane, and it peaked at spot 79 on the German album charts. This album was more pensive than the first, however, and was interesting due to its social criticism, epitomized by the release of the anti-racist single \\"√ñffne Die Augen\\" (\\"Open Your Eyes\\") with Frankfurt's D-Flame. Afrob's engagement with German racism continued with his participation in the Brothers Keepers project, collaborating with an all-star cast of Afro-German musicians in the single \\"Adriano\\". The Brothers Keepers project also marked the first collaboration with Samy Deluxe. They met again when they worked on the single \\"Four Fists\\". They enjoyed the experience together so much that they decided to unite as one group called ASD (Afrob und Samy Deluxe) and record an entire album together. The product of this cooperation was called Wer H√§tte Das Gedacht? (\\"Who Would Have Thought?\\"), which hit the stores in 2003. Today, Wer h√§tte das gedacht? remains as Afrob‚Äôs most successful album, having reached fifth place in the German charts. After the success of ASD, Afrob released his third solo album in 2005. The album, named Hammer, was released on February 28, 2005 by Four Music, and it was notable for being produced by the American producers Needlz, Waajeed, and B. R. Gunna. The Album was not as successful as Wer H√§tte Das Gedacht?, and it peaked at number 38 of the German charts. In 2006, Afrob collaborated in the solo album of the German rapper Lisi, Eine wie keine (One of a Kind). In the following year of 2007, Afrob made his acting debut in the comedy Leroy. Later, he appeared in the 2009 gangster film Kopf oder Zahl. Splash-Festival (2000) In 2008, Afrob and rapper Brixx produced the title song for the RTL-Series Alarm fuer Cobra 11 ‚Äì Die Autobahnpolizei. The same year, Afrob left the label Four Music and founded his own label named ‚ÄúG-Lette Music‚Äù. Lastly, Afrob began work on his album Der Letzte seiner Art in 2008, which was finally released in the September of 2009. Der Letzte seiner Art reached a peak at spot 70 on the German alum charts. After a four year creative break, Afrob appeared in the German rapper Sido‚Äôs 2013 song, 30-11-80. Next, Afrob‚Äôs fifth solo album Push debuted on May 30, 2014. Push came as a bigger success compared to Afrob's previous albums, Hammer and Der Letzte seiner Art. Push peaked at spot 20 of the German album charts. On July 3, 2015 Afrob and Samy Deluxe released their second ASD album Blockbasta, which peaked at number five on the German album charts. On September 23, 2016 Afrob released his sixth solo album Mutterschiff, and in 2017, he released his seventh solo album Beats, Rhymes & Mr. Scardanelli. His most recent and potentially final album Abschied von Gestern (Goodbye to Yesterday) was released in 2019. In this album, Afrob discusses topics such as his relationship with rap and the hip hop community. Furthermore, the song \\"Fl√ºchtling4Life\\" (\\"Refugee4Life\\") addresses the xenophobia and racism Afrob has personally experienced living in Germany. Afrob is active on social media, boasting a Facebook page, Instagram account, and a Twitter account among other forms of social media. On April 21, 2020, Afrob streamed a showcase on Facebook Live with DJ Derezon to raise donations for Stuttgart artists who were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Bergall is the subject of an episode of the syndicated television anthology series, The Silent Service, which aired during the 1957‚Äì1958 season. Operational history =USS Bergall= Japanese cruiser My≈çk≈ç's stern. Bergall was launched on 16 February 1944 sponsored by Mrs. J. A. Elkins, and commissioned on 12 June 1944 with Lieutenant Commander J. M. Hyde in command. Assigned to the Pacific Fleet, Bergall arrived at Pearl Harbor 13 August 1944. Operating out of Fremantle, Australia, the submarine made five war patrols between 8 September 1944 and 17 June 1945 in the South China Sea, Java Sea, Lombok Strait, and north of the Malay Barrier. During these patrols Bergall sank two merchantmen totaling 14,710 tons and one 740-ton frigate. On 13 December 1944, Bergall engaged Japanese heavy cruiser My≈çk≈ç and both ships were damaged. Bergall had to end her patrol after being hit by a dud 8-inch shell; My≈çk≈ç sailed to Singapore and was never repaired. While patrolling off the Malay coast, 13 June 1945, she was damaged aft by an allied naval mine explosion and forced to retire to Subic Bay, Luzon, for emergency repairs, arriving 17 June. Proceeding home for permanent repairs, she arrived at Portsmouth Navy Yard on 4 August 1945. Following repairs Bergall rejoined the Pacific Fleet in December 1945. She remained on active duty with the Pacific Fleet until departing Pearl Harbor for the Atlantic 10 June 1950. During this time she made one cruise to the Far East from 4 December 1948 to 28 February 1949. On 11 July 1950 she transferred to New London, Connecticut, beginning her operations with the Atlantic Fleet with a Mediterranean Sea cruise. During a fleet exercise on 1 November 1954, she collided with while attempting to fire simulated torpedoes at a surface attack force. On 26 September 1958, Bergall left the United States, entered the Mediterranean on 9 October, and arrived in ƒ∞zmir, Turkey, on 15 October, where she was decommissioned on 17 October and transferred to the Turkish Navy, commissioned there as Turgutreis (\\"turgatrees\\"). Bergall received four battle stars during World War II. =TCG Turgutreis= Ex-Bergall was transferred, on loan, to Turkey on 17 October 1958, where she served as TCG Turgutreis (S 342). Her name was struck from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1973, and she was sold to the Turkish government on 15 February 1973. Turgutreis served in the Turkish Navy until decommissioned on 5 April 1983. She was renamed Ceryan Botu - 6 and served as a yard craft and charging boat for her sisters at G√∂lc√ºk Navy Yard until she was released from service in 1996. She was sold for scrap in April 2000.

After completion of her sea trials she was commissioned on 13 June 1969. She became the 84th nuclear submarine to enter the Fleet and the 43rd attack type. Her assignment upon commissioning was to Submarine Development Group Two in Groton, Connecticut. This assignment was to fully test the Navy's newest all-purpose sonar, the AN/BQS-13. In 1970 Bergall became the first submarine to undergo the MK-48 torpedo conversion and in 1971 she was the first ship to carry the MK-48 torpedo in its operational warshot configuration. The AN/BQQ-5 digital sonar system was temporarily installed for test and evaluation in 1972. Bergall was awarded her first Navy Unit Commendation that year for her performance in the testing of the sonar systems and outstanding MK-48 torpedo proficiency. BERGALL has earned the Navy Unit Commendation (twice), Meritorious Unit Commendation (Four times), and numerous Battle Efficiency (\\"E\\"), Anti- submarine Warfare (\\"A\\"), Weapons Proficiency (\\"E\\"), Damage Control (\\"DC\\") and Communications (\\"C\\"). Bergall was twice awarded the Commander, Sixth Fleet \\"Hook 'Em\\" award during deployment to the Mediterranean in 1977 and 1982. Bergall appeared in three movies ‚Äì \\"The Submarine\\", \\"Topside Safety\\" and episode 3 of the British TV series Sailor . In Sailor a medical evacuation from BERGALL was undertaken by a helicopter from the British Aircraft Carrier HMS Ark Royal Bergall was the first east -coast submarine to carry a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV). Bergall completed 14 deployments and various exercises and operations vital to the national security of the United States. 1983 Deployed on North Atlantic Patrol for 3 months. 1983 Upon return to Norfolk, VA, SUBRON 6, she immediately resupplied then got underway for a second North Atlantic Patrol taking the billet left vacant by another sub, unable to leave the pier due to engineering difficulties. January 1985 Deployed for the North Atlantic then after refit at Holy Loch, Scotland sailed for the Mediterranean where she performed several patrols in support of 6th fleet operations. April 1985 Refit Sardinia, Italy then returned to operations in support of the 6th fleet. June 1985 Bergall returned home to SUBRON 6 Norfolk, VA after 6 months away. She was inactivated on 4 August 1995 and decommissioned 6 June 1996. =Collision with USS Kittiwake (ASR-13), 1984 = On 23 April 1984, the submarine rescue vessel collided with Bergall at Norfolk, Virginia, while Bergall was moored to the pier aft of Kittiwake. Kittiwake was getting underway for the first time since she had undergone maintenance, during which her main drive motor was re-wired improperly, causing it and the screw it drove to rotate in the opposite direction from that ordered by personnel on Kittiwakes bridge. This was unknown to Kittiwakes bridge personnel, who found that Kittiwake started to drift aft when they were expecting her to move forward. Noting the backward motion, they ordered an increase in the motor drive speed in order to correct it and get Kittiwake moving forward, but unwittingly caused Kittiwake to move further aft and at a higher speed. Still not realizing that Kittiwakes main drive motor operating in reverse of what they expected, Kittiwakes bridge personnel then ordered another increase in Kittiwakes forward speed, which only served to increase her speed astern. This continued until Kittiwakes stern backed into Bergalls sonar dome. Decommissioning and disposal Bergall was decommissioned on 6 June 1996 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 June 1997. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 29 September 1997.

Though only five were killed directly, the US$1.77 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in damage accrued by Frederic made it the Atlantic basin's costliest tropical cyclone on record at the time. Prior to its final landfall, the threat that Frederic imposed on areas of the U.S. Gulf Coast triggered a mass exodus from the region larger than any other evacuation in the past. While the storm primarily impacted the U.S. states of Mississippi and Alabama, lesser effects were felt throughout the Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as inland North America. Frederic developed from a tropical depression south of the Cape Verde Islands on August 28, 1979. Tracking at a steady clip westward, the primitive cyclone reached tropical storm intensity the next day. Favorable conditions in the open Atlantic allowed for Frederic to reach hurricane intensity on September 1\\\\. However, outflow from nearby Hurricane David began to inhibit further intensification and would continue to do so for roughly a week, weakening Frederic as it tracked across the Greater Antilles. The tropical cyclone nearly dissipated over Cuba before redeveloping on September 9 near the Isle of Youth. From then on, Frederic moved northwestward, intensifying to its peak intensity in the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h) on September 12, shortly before making landfall at Dauphin Island, Alabama just below the state line between Alabama and Mississippi. Over the United States, Frederic weakened for a final time before becoming extratropical in Pennsylvania on September 14 and dissipating the next day. Damage estimates vary due to inadequate reporting of private insurance claims as well as lack of hard data on uninsured damage; Frederic is believed to have inflicted $5 million (1979 USD) in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with an additional $1.7 billion in damage on the mainland United States. FEMA, which had been established only three months before Frederic hit, was the focal point for nearly $250 million in federal aid for recovery, $188 million of which went to Alabama (1979 USD). In southern Alabama, the landscape was changed for years, with thousands of tall pine trees tilted and leaning northwest. Meteorological history The precursor to Hurricane Frederic emerged as a loosely defined tropical wave off the west coast of Africa late on August 27\\\\. The following day, satellite images indicated that the tropical wave had become more defined, and was beginning to show signs of cyclonic rotation. At 0600 UTC on August 29, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as a tropical depression based on observational data from ships nearby in conjunction with satellite images. Upon developing into a tropical cyclone, the depression moved at an unusually rapid pace westward, gradually curving towards the west-northwest and slowly intensifying in ideal conditions. At 1200 UTC on August 30, the tropical depression was upgraded to tropical storm status and thus named Frederic. Intensification continued after the storm's upgrade, and early on September 1, Frederic developed an eye, prompting the NHC to further upgrade the tropical cyclone to hurricane status at 0600 UTC that day. Frederic only maintained hurricane intensity for roughly eighteen hours over the open waters of the Atlantic on September 1 before outflow from nearby Hurricane David began to adversely affect the tropical cyclone. At 0000 UTC on September 2, Frederic weakened back to tropical storm strength while it was still well east of the Lesser Antilles. This weakening phase continued as Frederic began to assume a more westerly track and slow in forward motion. On September 4, Frederic tracked over the Virgin Islands before making landfall on Puerto Rico later that day with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h). Frederic's interaction with Puerto Rico greatly disrupted the low-level circulation contained within the tropical cyclone, enhancing the weakening effects of Hurricane David's outflow. After passing over the island, the tropical storm briefly took a southwest course before curving into Hispaniola on September 6, inducing additional disruption within Frederic. At 1800 UTC that day, Frederic was downgraded to tropical depression status north of Haiti. Frederic remained a tropical depression for two days as it tracked into and then parallel to the southern coast of Cuba beginning on September 7\\\\. During this time, Hurricane David had tracked far into the Northeastern United States, and as a result its inhibiting effects of intensification ceased. At 0000 UTC on September 9, Frederic regained tropical storm intensity while located roughly 100 mi (160 km/h) east of the Isle of Youth. The following day, the cyclone tracked over western Cuba as it gradually curved towards the northwest. Favorable conditions, marked by very warm sea surface temperatures as high as 86 ¬∞F (30 ¬∞C) and the presence of a large anticyclone over the system, allowed Frederic to strengthen to hurricane status for a second time while just northwest of Cuba, despite proximity to land. Frederic took a northwesterly course throughout its trek across the Gulf of Mexico in early September, intensifying in a highly conducive environment. By 1800 UTC on September 10, the hurricane became stronger than it had ever been over the central Atlantic. At 0000 UTC on September 12, Frederic attained major hurricane status over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and twelve hours later reached peak intensity with a minimum barometric pressure of 943 mbar (hPa; 27.85 inHg) and sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h), making the cyclone a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Moving gradually faster in the Gulf of Mexico, Frederic eventually made two landfalls ‚Äì one on Dauphin Island and the other near the border between Alabama and Mississippi ‚Äì with a virtually unchanged intensity. Tracking rapidly northward, Frederic began to weaken due to land interaction, and was downgraded to tropical storm status while it was near Meridian, Mississippi on September 13. At around the same time, the cyclone began to curve northeastward, eventually merging with an extratropical cyclone in southwestern Pennsylvania by 1800 UTC on September 14\\\\. These extratropical remnants proceeded to track through the Mid-Atlantic states and New England before they were last officially documented by the NHC in New Brunswick on September 15. However, the Canadian Hurricane Centre still considered the cyclone active up until the storm entered the Labrador Sea on September 16. Preparations Evacuation out of the Mobile area The first tropical cyclone watches and warnings issued in association with Frederic were on September 3, when the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning and gale warning for several islands of the Lesser Antilles stretching from Dominica to the northern Leeward Islands. Residents of Charlotte Amalie in the United States Virgin Islands were urged by governor Juan Francisco Luis to move to 24 emergency shelters. Luis also mobilized a company of the Virgin Islands National Guard to expedite evacuations and protect emptied residences and other buildings from looting. Further south in Dominica, Melville Hall Airport was forced to close due to the presence of gale-force winds, delaying relief efforts following Hurricane David. Despite having weakened to a tropical storm by the time Frederic moved over the Virgin Islands, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for Puerto Rico on September 4. As precautionary measures, the Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport and schools closed for the duration of the storm. Hundreds of residents were ordered to evacuate from Toa Baja for the second time in just four days due to the threat of flooding rivers. In Trujillo Alto, a dike was relieved in order to mitigate potential flooding. After its track across Puerto Rico, gale warnings were issued for portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands. No watches or warnings were issued by the NHC for any areas while Frederic was classified as a tropical depression over the Greater Antilles. However, small craft warnings were posted for some coastal regions off of Miami, Florida due to strong winds caused by the nearby tropical cyclone. After Frederic reattained hurricane status in the Gulf of Mexico on September 10, a gale warning were issued for the Dry Tortugas; this was the first NHC warning issued in association with the newly developed tropical cyclone. Not long after, a hurricane watch was issued for coastal areas extending from Panama City, Florida to Vermilion Bay in Louisiana. Although forecasts showed that Frederic posed no threat to Sarasota, Florida, the city readied barrels of water if distribution was necessitated to Sarasota County's 58 emergency shelters. Municipality managers were asked to place their respective emergency personnel on standby. In Key West, Florida, city workers had shortened workdays while the storm moved close by. Up to 500,000 were evacuated from the U.S. Gulf Coast in anticipation of Frederic's arrival. Impact =Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico= Effects from Frederic were first felt on the outward facing Leeward Islands. In Antigua, the threat of widespread power outages forced the insular government to shut down power. A peak gust of 62 mph (100 km/h) was documented on the island as a result of the storm. These strong winds also unroofed some buildings. Strong winds and rain were felt in Guadeloupe, Barbuda, and a number of other islands, but no damaging effects from the passing tropical cyclone occurred in those locations. Power outages knocked out electricity to half of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands and downed telephone lines. Rainfall and downed trees blocked several roads. Offshore, the yacht Princess blew out into sea, prompting a coast guard rescue of the ship and its crew. As a tropical storm, Frederic dropped heavy rain across the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Despite having weakened from its prior hurricane intensity, the storm still brought gale-force winds coupled with gusts as strong as 70 mph (110 km/h) to the area. Three apartments in the same apartment complex on St. Thomas were unroofed, displacing roughly 50 families. Electricity was deliberately cut during the late night hours to prevent the spread of power outages. In St. Maarten, these strong winds toppled a radio antenna. The entirety of the U.S. Virgin Islands reported numerous felled trees and downed utility lines as a result of the strong winds. Wind damage on nearby Puerto Rico was of only minor extent and much less severe than in the Virgin Islands. However, torrential precipitation accounted for most of the damage, as the passage of Hurricane David less than a week earlier saturated soils, priming the area for floods induced by the passage of Frederic. Rainfall peaked at around in 12 hours in Puerto Rico and in 30 hours in St. Croix. alt=Contoured map showing rainfall totals in increments of two inches (50 millimeters). All rivers in southeastern Puerto Rico swelled and produce significant flooding in adjacent floodplains. The discharge of the Rio Santiago near Naguabo reached 100-year levels. These floods partially inundated several cities, submerged crops, and damaged numerous roads. Major arterial roads to and from Ponce were blocked by floodwater and landslide debris. Some portions of Puerto Rico Highway 3 were submerged by water from both the torrential rain and wave action. Damage from Frederic in Puerto Rico reached at least US$5 million, though western Puerto Rico sustained minimal damage from the storm. In St. Thomas, four small homes were destroyed by flooding, and an additional 50 sustained at least partial damage. One waterspout was reported off the coast, but did no damage. Normally dry coastal guts in St. Croix filled with floodwater from Frederic, damaging homes and other buildings in five communities on St. Croix. Culverts, bridges, and heavy beach erosion resulted from rough surf off the coast of the island. The floods generated various sewage problems. Flowing floodwaters washed away plentiful food crops in St. Maarten. Some homes were damaged and others destroyed on the adjacent Sint Maarten. Off of the island, seven people were killed after their fishing boat sank during the storm. Damage in Virgin Islands also reached at least US$5 million, similar to Puerto Rico. =Hispaniola and Cuba= Heavy rains buffeted the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba for several days as Frederic, albeit disorganized, tracked over the Greater Antilles. As with Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, precipitation damage was exacerbated by the recent passage of Hurricane David. In Guant√°namo on Cuba's eastern Atlantic coast, at least of rainfall was reported. Frederic continued to produce strong winds even as a weak tropical depression south of Cuba, as sustained winds of 46 mph (74 km/h) were clocked in Santa Cruz del Sur on September 7\\\\. However, damage from Frederic in Hispaniola and eastern Cuba remained minimal. Frederic's landfall on western Cuba as a redeveloped tropical cyclone was much more significant than its first Cuban landfall. Sustained winds peaked at 52 mph (84 km/h) in Bah√≠a Honda, Cuba on September 10. Despite recent renovations at Jos√© Mart√≠ International Airport, the lack of a proper drainage system allowed rainfall to inundate the airport, stranding several heads of state that were scheduled to hold a summit and disrupting air traffic to and from the airport for an entire week. Heavy precipitation triggered numerous landslides, causing severe damage to infrastructure and over 250 dwellings. Areas at risk for additional landslide activity were declared inhospitable, resulting in the evacuation of 1,200 people. Rainfall estimates in Cuba peaked at 5 in (125 mm). A lack of damage reports was evident from western Cuba following Frederic's landfall, though damage estimates were high. =United States= The Dauphin Island Bridge was destroyed by Hurricane Frederic, making it only reachable by boat. Storm surge damage was reported along 80 miles of coastline from Mississippi to Florida, with tides 8 to 12 feet (2.4-3.7 m) above the normal level being observed. Five deaths were directly attributed to Frederic in the United States, four of which occurred inland: a person swept from a boat near Pensacola was the only casualty along the coast. In total, Frederic was responsible for $1.7 billion in damages. This made Frederic the costliest hurricane in the history of the United States at the time; the figure was not surpassed until Hurricane Alicia in 1983. Frederic also dumped heavy rainfall across much of the eastern United States. Over a dozen tornadoes were also reported in Frederic's wake. However, these had minimal impact. Florida As Frederic was strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico, strong winds were reported in the Florida Keys. A station on the Dry Tortugas recorded a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust on September 10; this was stronger than any other Florida wind gust measurement in association with Frederic. A station in Key West, Florida clocked at 43 mph (69 km/h) wind gust, coupled with sustained winds of 29 mph (47 km/h). Tides in the Dry Tortugas peaked at 15 ft (4.6 m), roughly 12 ft (3.7 m) above normal. Rainfall from the extremities of the hurricane reached South Florida, with some rainfall totals exceeding 7 in (180 mm). Alabama Frederic made landfall at Dauphin Island, Alabama and continued across to a point on the Alabama/Mississippi state line near Bayou La Batre, Alabama. Near-total property damage occurred along the Alabama coastline between Fort Morgan and Gulf Shores, the latter seeing 80% of its buildings completely destroyed. The causeway linking Dauphin Island to the mainland was swept away in many areas. Alabama's second-largest city (at that time), Mobile, Alabama suffered extensive damage as well. Wind damage was also severe, especially across southern Alabama. Hurricane-force gusts were felt as far inland as Choctaw County. Structural failure was widespread in the immediate landfall area with industrial, residential and governmental buildings as well as hospitals suffering heavy damage. Nearly 90% of the Mobile area lost electricity, and the historic City Hall experienced heavy roof damage. Many small beach houses were completely destroyed by high winds before the storm surge could add any effects. Tree damage with broken limbs was extensive, leaving thousands of tall pine trees all tilted, leaning in the direction of the wind. 11 Alabama counties were declared disaster areas. Mississippi About of rain fell in Jackson County, Mississippi around Biloxi and Pascagoula. 16 Mississippi counties were declared disaster areas; the most in the United States. Hurricane-force winds were felt as far northward as Meridian, Mississippi. =Canada= Frederic dropped heavy rain across Canada as an extratropical storm, peaking at 137 mm (5.39 in) near Ottawa, Ontario. Record precipitation was recorded at the J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory in Sainte-Anne-de- Bellevue, Quebec, which documented 77 mm (3.03 in) of rain on September 15\\\\. Rainfall spread as far northeast as the eastern coast of Labrador. Flooding occurred in eastern Ontario and portions of the Niagara Peninsula, as noted in Cornwall. In Toronto, the rains led to a seven-car traffic collision and a separate car accident that injured two. Flooding also took place in southern Quebec, with floodwater submerging streets, basements, and underground parking lots in Montreal. Damage from southern Quebec reached C$8.238 million (US$7.095 million). Aftermath Damage after Hurricane Frederic in Gulf Shores, Alabama Eleven counties in Alabama, 16 in Mississippi, and five in Florida were declared eligible for disaster aid. In retrospect, Frederic has been credited with spurring redevelopment in Mobile and the surrounding Gulf Coast region. For example, in testimony before Congress in 1992, Robert Sheets (then the director of the National Hurricane Center), described the economic aftermath of Frederic: > Prior to Hurricane Frederic, there was one condominium complex on Gulf > Shores, Alabama. Most of the homes were single, individual homes built > behind the sand dunes. Today, where there used to be one condominium, there > are now at least 104 complexes ‚Äì not units, complexes ‚Äì on Gulf Shores, > Alabama. =Retirement= Because of extensive destruction, the name Frederic was retired, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with Fabian in the 1985 season until it would itself be retired after the 2003 season. Hurricanes David and Frederic were the first male hurricane names to be retired, as the practice of alternating male and female hurricane names was introduced in the 1979 season. In popular culture \\"The New War,\\" the first Mack Bolan novel after Don Pendleton turned over Executioner series to Gold Eagle, is set during Hurricane Frederic with the storm's devastation having a major effect on the story. The Abyss, a novel by Orson Scott Card, made into a 1989 film, directed and written by James Cameron features Hurricane Frederick, although those events take place 10 years later.

It is located on the V√°h river, around 30 km from the city of ≈Ωilina. It belongs to Upper V√°h region of tourism.  Profile  Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica is situated in a fold of mountain ranges Str√°≈æovsk√© vrchy (1213 m) and Javorn√≠ky (1071 m a.s.l.). Mountains offer an attractive experience to trekkers and mountain-bikers in summer season, cross-country and skiing opportunities in winter season. Veƒæk√Ω Man√≠n mountain (890 m a.s.l.) dominates the town skyline providing views from most places in the town. On the hill next to the town on the opposite side of the river V√°h lies the ruins of Pova≈æsk√Ω hrad castle with two manor houses beneath, to which the town's history is closely bounded. Another popular tourist attraction close to the town is a breathtaking canyon Man√≠nska ties≈àava. Canyon splits Veƒæk√Ω and Mal√Ω Man√≠n mountains. It is an internationally sought-after place-to-die for rock climbers. It is also less known as one of the filming sites for The NeverEnding Story in 1984. Just a few kilometers away lies another highly challenging reef formation: S√∫ƒæovsk√© skaly. To sum it up one of the most famous Slovak spas Rajeck√© Teplice lies about 20 km from the town, few kilometres closer are the youngest spas in Slovakia in Nimnica. Town has mostly postmodern architecture meaning that most of the pre-20th-century buildings were replaced in the 1960s and 1980s. Motorway viaduct above the town Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica lies on the major traffic route Bratislava - ≈Ωilina causing many traffic jams in the recent years. The motorway viaduct was built through the narrowest segment of the town, which was opened on 31 May 2010. Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica has one twin town Ro≈ænov pod Radho≈°tƒõm in the Czech Republic. History Ruins of Pova≈æsk√Ω hrad castle above the town The roots of the settlement of the town roots to Baden culture, also Celtic coins were found on the castle cliff supporting the presence of previous settlers. However, the first written reference to the town comes from 1316, in connection with Matthew III Cs√°k. The next known reference about Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica is dated 13 July 1330. In 1432, the town was burned by Hussite troops. The history of the town is very closely connected with the nearby Pova≈æsk√Ω hrad castle, built in the 13th century. The most famous owners of the Bystrica castle and the land were knights J√°n and Rafael Podmanitzky, known for their robberies. The family of Podmanicki became rulers of the town in 1458, when King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary donated the castle, the town and 16 surrounding villages to Ladislav Podmanitzky. During their reign, which lasted almost 100 years, the town was flourishing. This was supported by important document Articuli Podmanickyani, which stated the statute of the town and establishing old Slovak language the only official language among congildones. No other town, except Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica and Var√≠n, had a statute with such provision regarding language use. Rafael Podmanitzky. Seal from the 17th century. As an example of the language could be used engraving on the tombstone of Rafael Podmanitzky in the Church of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary in Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica. The next one hundred years were hard for the town and the region, because of upheavals of several Hungarian noblemen. The town was plundered by troops of Stephen Bocskai (1604), Emeric Th√∂k√∂ly (1679), Berecz√©nyi and Oƒçkay (1707). Despite the hard times, the town obtained more and more privileges from Hungarian kings during the period, and it had a significantly higher status than the surrounding countryside. This ended in 1886, when a new Hungarian legislation canceled all the privileges. In 1918, the town became part of the Czechoslovak republic. In 1929, an ammunition plant Roth transferred its production from Bratislava to Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica, which significantly improved the employment situation. Starting in 1937 and continuing until 1945 rifles (vz.24 and K98k) and small arms ammunition were manufactured here. After World War II the munitions factory at Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica continued to produce weapons and ammunition for both the military and for commercial purposes. Since World War II, and especially in the 1970s and 1980s, the town grew significantly. New residential areas were built around the tiny town center. The town center itself was re-built completely, therefore you can hardly find any historical buildings there now. The main employer since the second world war was the engineering plant Pova≈æsk√© stroj√°rne. The plant mainly manufactured scooters and industrial bearings. Since the end of socialism, the company has not prospered. This has caused increased unemployment. Demographics According to the 2001 census, the town had 42,733 inhabitants. 97.72% of inhabitants were Slovaks and 1.01% Czechs. The religious make-up was 81.10% Roman Catholics, 12.18% people with no religious affiliation, and 2.56% Lutherans. Interesting places = Places of history = Coins found on the castle cliff, dated to the first century BC. Pova≈æsk√Ω hrad with Sz√°paryovsk√Ω ka≈°tieƒæ  Pova≈æsk√Ω hrad  Pova≈æsk√Ω hrad is a landmark of the town and witness of the history (e.g., Celtic coins were found on the castle cliff). It went through many reconstructions, therefore it represents many different architectural movements. The towers of the town were accepted as the symbols to the coat of arms of the town. Nowadays some minor works are done on the castle by voluntary organization Zdruzenie hradu Bystrica, but castle needs a more complex reconstruction.  Burg  The Burg was built in the first half of the 17th century, and is representative of Slovak renaissance culture.  Church of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary in Povazska Bystrica  The Church of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary in Povazska Bystrica is the main church in the town, situated in the heart of the town gives the crossection between 14th-century architecture and the architecture of the first half of the 20th century in Slovakia. It was built by J√°n Podmanitzky, the owner of the castle in gothic style. In 1913-1914 the tower of the church was covered with baroque \\"onion like\\" construction. From the original buildings only the presbytery and the northern perimetric wall still stand. Major reconstruction and enlarging began in 1940. Church's windows are filled with colourful stained glass filling created by Slovak artist Vincent Hlo≈æn√≠k and his wife Viera Hlo≈æn√≠kov√° in 1951. In front of the church is a sandstone statue of saint Mary to which church is dedicated. Inside are epitaphs of Zigmund Balassa, Alzbeta Zborovska, tombstone of Rafael Podmaintzky remains of caryatids and the depiction of the old town on the Balassa tombstone.  Orlove manor house  Manor house Orlove Orlov√© manor-house was built in 1612 by the Hungarian noble, ≈Ωigmund Balassa. Originally, it was a Renaissance single-storey manor-house which was supposed to bring the promise of new, modern and comfortable living for the aristocratic Balassa family, which the cold and uninviting Pova≈æsk√Ω castle could no longer provide. At the time, it was quite common for the nobility to abandon their castles ‚Äì unconquerable, stone fortresses whose defensive function has lost their meaning ‚Äì and to build modern, comfortable family seats in the town or countryside. The manor- house was then known as Zsigmond H√°za, or ≈Ωigmund's house. At the beginning of the 18th century, renovation works turned the manor-house into a two-storey four-wing manor. Another important owner who had a large impact on the manor- house's appearance was Pavol Balassa, the great-grandson of its founder. In the first half of the 18th century, he together with his wife, Juliana Batthy√°ny reconstructed the manor-house in a grandiose Baroque style. The park and courtyard with its fountain were also added at the time. We can read about this reconstruction on the commemorative inscription above the manor-house's entrance gate. In the entrance gateway, we can see the alliance coat of arms of the Balassa and Bathy√°ny families. Both family coats of arms are joined by the imperial crown expressing thanks to Maria Theresa and the imperial court for confirming the Balassa family's title of count. One of the most precious parts of the manor-house is the late Baroque chapel of St John of Nepomuk with its Rococo interior, built between 1770 and 1780. The chapel takes up two storeys in the manor-house's west wing. The Balassa family owned this grand family seat for a long 250 years. Later, it had several owners, not of all which were of benefit to the manor-house or its surroundings.At the beginning of the 20th century, the manor-house was owned for several years by the world- famous Czech violin virtuoso and composer, Jan Kubel√≠k. Before the World War II Orlove manor-house became the residence of Ing. Klementin Ru≈æiƒçka, the General Director of Zbrojovka Brno, the largest armory in Czecho-Slovakian region. He moved to the palace Orlove together with his family. Opposed to his predecessors, previous owners of the palace Orlove, he resided there permanently. During his tenure he cared a lot to preserve the palace identity and its architecture style. In Socialistic period of the Slovac history Orlove manor-house became the property of the state and served as an administrative building of the local archive, later, as a dormitory for season workers, after all, as a local museum. A four-star hotel Gino Park Palace is settled in Orlove manor-house nowadays. It offers a high standard luxury accommodation, restaurant services and events all year around.  Kalvaria Povazska Bystrica  Kalvaria in Povazska Bystrica was mostly destroyed during the socialist era. It has 11 stops leading to the main Chapel of Saint Magdalene on the top of the hill. Last reconstruction of the monument was done in 1937. In spite of its present state, it is a part of national heritage. In the chapel of Saint Magdalene there were the statues of Jesus and two men on the hill Golgotha, but because of the situation statues were moved to the main town church.  Manor Povazske Podhradie  Szap√°ry Castle is a rococo style building with granary and system of outbuildings, below the castle. A chapel was built inside between 1763 and 1764. The chapel was reconstructed in 1960. In the interior of the manor house were rococo paintings, stone coats of arms.  Chapel of Saint Helena  Chapel of Saint Helena in Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica The Chapel of Saint Helena was built in 1728 by count Peter Szaparay on the hill above the town. It is surrounded by lindens, of which one is more than 250 years old. The chapel was robbed and became a ruin until it was renewed in the 1990s.  Kostol Svateho Ladislava  Kostol Sv. Ladislava Kostol sv. Ladislava v Povazskom Podhradi is the last fourth member of the four historical buildings build nearby the castle, creating the panorama of Povazske Podhradie. It was built in the 19th century. In the premises of the church is statue of John of Nepomuk, which was coincidentally brought to Povazske Podhradie on abandoned flatboat during floods in 1784. After the floods the statue was placed on the place of its founding with five lindens around. However, after some time lindens grew together forming one massive linden-tree. From this point people started to idolize the linden with the statue as a wonder of nature until the linden was cut down during the building of new manmade basin of the river Vah. = Nature =  Man√≠nska ties≈àava  Man√≠nska ties≈àava Man√≠nska ties≈àava is the narrowest canyon in Slovakia, lying 6 kilometres from Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica. It is place of great tourist interest, because of its wild and rare flora and fauna. It is frequently visited by rock climbers. = Modern architecture =  Estak√°da  Opening day of the Estak√°da viaduct The Motorway viaduct, due to its size, conception and short time of building, can be counted between the top structures of civil engineering in Slovakia. On 31 May 2010 the town viaduct was opened for traffic use. AB≈†O  Administrative building of executive agencies (AB≈†O) The Administrative building AB≈†O in Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica is one of the most important buildings from the remarkably prolific period of the 1960s that united the then typical figure of office buildings and hotels with an original technical design and lightened construction and shell of the building. It surpassed the Slovak context and was in the given period unique at least in the context of Czechoslovakia. It is part of the programme for recovery and protection of modern architecture heritage Docomomo.  Building of RVP (Tatra banka building) The Building of Tatra banka is one of the few traces left of old town centre which was demolished in seventies. It is the most important example of interwar modern architecture building in town. It is included in the list of monuments of the town.http://www.povazska- bystrica.sk/download_file_f.php?id=153056 Boroughs Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica has 9 boroughs. 75% of population live in the town, most of them in the apartment blocks. 25% of the population live in the villages.

The first great seal of the state was specified in the State Constitution of 1777, and its current form was adopted in 1799 with alterations in 1914. Its specifications are currently spelled out by statute. Description The original seal from 1777 was specified as such: \\"The great seal of this State shall have the following device: on one side of a scroll, whereon shall be engraved ‚ÄúThe Constitution of the State of Georgia;‚Äù and the motto ‚ÄúPro bono publico.‚Äù On the other side, an elegant house, and other buildings, fields of corn, and meadows covered with sheep and cattle; a river running through the same, with a ship under full sail, and the motto, ‚ÄúDeus nobis haec otia fecit.‚Äù On February 8, 1799 an Act of the Legislature stated the seal as \\"On the one side a view of the seashore with a ship bearing the flag of the United States, riding near a wharf, receiving aboard hogsheads of tobacco and bales of cotton, emblematic of the exports of this State; at a small distance a boat landing from the interior of the State with hogsheads etc., on board representing her internal traffic; in the back part of the same side, a man in the act of ploughing; and at a small distance a flock of sheep in different postures shaded by a flourishing tree, the motto on this side agriculture and commerce, 1799. That the other side contain three pillars supporting an arch, with the word Con stitution, engraven within the same, emblematic of the Constitution supported by three departments of the government, viz.: the legislative, judicial and executive, the first pillar to have engraven on its base, wisdom; the second justice; and the third, moderation; on the right of the last pillar a man standing with a drawn sword, representing the aid of the military in defense of the Constitution; the motto, State of Georgia, 1799\\". =Current design= The obverse (front) of the seal is centered on the coat of arms of the state: an arch with three columns, the arch symbolizing the state's Constitution and the columns representing the three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial). The words of the official state motto, \\"Wisdom, Justice, Moderation,\\" are inscribed on scrolls that are wrapped around the columns. A member of the Georgia Militia stands between the second and third columns, holding a drawn sword in his right hand, representing the citizen/soldier's defense of the state's Constitution. A border surrounds the coat of arms, and the motto \\"State of Georgia, 1776\\" is inscribed outside the arms. The reverse (back) of the seal contains an image of Georgia's coast, with a ship (bearing the American flag) arriving to take aboard tobacco and cotton, symbolizing Georgia's export trade. A second, smaller boat represents the state's \\"internal traffic.\\" Towards the left of the image, there is a man plowing and a flock of sheep. The motto \\"Agriculture and Commerce, 1776\\" is inscribed around the outside of the image. The dates listed on the obverse and reverse of the seal were originally 1799. The dates were changed by the Georgia state legislature in 1914 to reflect the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. History and lore In 1902, the Georgia legislature mandated that the coat of arms (the central portion of the obverse) be included in the state flag of Georgia. Either the coat of arms or the state seal has appeared on every state flag since that date. A large metallic representation of the Seal, as seen at a rest area along Interstate 20 in Georgia. By law, the Secretary of State is the official custodian of the Great Seal, which is attached to official papers by executive order of the Governor. This custodianship has led to some controversies: =Period of the False Seal= From 1868 to 1871, during the era of Reconstruction, the Great Seal was not used for state business. It had been hidden under the home of wartime Secretary of State Nathan C. Barnett, to prevent its use by Federal forces. The Reconstruction government, having failed to locate the official seal, had a duplicate seal fabricated. The duplicate was a perfect match for the original, except for one small detail: the soldier held his sword in his left hand. The era of Reconstruction government in Georgia became known as the \\"Period of the False Seal\\". In 1872, when Georgians re-took control of the government, Barnett (who had been re-elected by that point) unearthed the original seal and returned it to the Capitol. =Three Governors controversy= In December 1946, Governor-elect Eugene Talmadge died before assuming office. Talmadge's son, Herman, was appointed governor by the State Legislature. This was challenged by the Lieutenant Governor-elect Melvin Thompson, who maintained that the state constitution authorized him to assume the office upon the death of the governor. Outgoing governor Ellis Arnall announced that he would not relinquish the office until it was clear who the new governor was. The political turmoil that ensued became known as the \\"Three Governors Controversy\\". In January 1947, while all three governors occupied different portions of the State Capitol, Secretary of State Ben W. Fortson, Jr., took the seal and hid it. This prevented any of the claimants to the governorship from executing any business until the Supreme Court of Georgia could make a ruling on the rightful winner. Thompson was eventually declared \\"acting governor\\" until a special election could be held to fill the remainder of the original term. Herman Talmadge won the special election and served out the remaining portion of his father's term. UGA arch =The Arch= In 1857, the University of Georgia constructed a cast iron representation of the architectural elements featured on the obverse of the Great Seal. It stands at the north entrance of the campus, and has become known as The Arch. Fashioned from existing material, The Arch is a representation but not an exact replica of the elements of the Seal. Originally serving both symbolic and practical functions, it was connected to a barrier which kept cows from roaming over parts of the campus, and was initially known as The Gate. Today, The Arch is an important symbol of the University. According to legend, it is bad luck for freshmen (or, in some versions, any undergraduate student) to walk under the arch. Legend suggests that any student walking through the arch prematurely will never graduate.UGA.edu Government Seals of Georgia File:Georgia State Senate seal.pngSeal of the Georgia State Senate File:GAHouseSeal.pngSeal of the Georgia House of Representatives File:Seal of the Supreme Court of Georgia.gifSeal of the Supreme Court of Georgia See also *Flag of Georgia (U.S. state) *Seal *Governor of Georgia *Georgia Secretary of State Notes References External links * Image of Georgia historical marker - Hiding Place of the Great Seal Symbols of Georgia (U.S. state) Georgia Georgia Georgia ","title":"Seal of Georgia (U.S. state)"},{"id":"962903","text":"Charlotte Green (born 4 May 1956) is a British radio broadcaster and a former continuity announcer and news reader for BBC Radio 4. After 1988 she specialised in news reading, including reading the news on Radio 4 breakfast Today programme, and reading news items on The News Quiz. The Daily Telegraph described her as \\"the supreme Radio 4 announcer whose warm yet slightly formal tones were once voted the nation's favourite\\". Green left Radio 4 in January 2013, and currently reads the classified football results on BBC Radio 5 Live and the World Service Sports Report, succeeding James Alexander Gordon. Her autobiography The News is Read was published by The Robson Press in 2014. Early life Green was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls in Elstree, followed by the University of Kent, where she gained a first-class BA in English and American Literature and was involved in university radio, before joining the BBC as a studio manager in 1978 at the World Service. She has said that \\"I wanted to be an actress, but I decided there were too many actresses around, so I joined the BBC.\\" Broadcasting After reading out letters for PM and You and Yours she became a continuity announcer in 1985, and then a newsreader in 1988. She was a regular newsreader for the Today programme and the comedy programme The News Quiz, and she has worked on PM and the Shipping Forecast. From 29 October 2005, she joined Chris Evans's Saturday afternoon show on Radio 2 to read phone numbers and announcements. She was voted the \\"Most Attractive Female Voice on National Radio\\" in a poll by the BBC's Radio Times publication in 2002. Green has acknowledged the reliance lonely listeners place in her; her habit of wishing listeners \\"a peaceful night\\" led many to send her letters. In addition to newsreading, Green has been a presenter, including for a programme on church music, a classical music concert series, and a series on World Service news bulletins. She presented Notes & Queries with Clive Anderson on television. Between 2003 and 2006, Green was unique in her pronunciation of the years between 2001 and 2009. She adopted the 'twenty-oh' method instead of 'two- thousand-and'. This was said to have sparked so many complaints that she reverted to 'two-thousand-and' in 2006. She played herself in a 2005 radio episode of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and again played herself in 2008 in Simon Brett's radio detective drama Charles Paris. She has been impersonated by Jan Ravens reading out a double-entendres-filled shipping forecast on the BBC radio comedy show Dead Ringers. She signed a public letter of protest to the BBC Trust regarding cuts to the radio news service in 2007. Green has on occasions attracted some attention for inopportune giggling during on-air broadcasts. While announcing the death of American film and television writer Abby Mann, Green laughed after what is believed to be the world's earliest recording, played during the preceding item, was described off-air as sounding like \\"a bee trapped in a bottle\\". (RealPlayer) In a 2012 interview, she named the fall of the Berlin Wall as the 'biggest' story that she'd ever read the news for. Green, and her colleague Harriet Cass, left Radio 4, having opted for voluntary redundancy owing to reorganisation. Green's final news bulletin was the 6 o'clock news on Friday 18 January 2013. Green broadcast on Classic FM between April 2013 and December 2018 presenting Charlotte Green's Great Composers. A keen supporter of Tottenham Hotspur FC, in August 2013 it was announced that Green will follow James Alexander Gordon as the permanent announcer of the Saturday football results on BBC Radio 5 Live. Green's new role, the first ever woman appointed to the post, began on 28 September 2013. As of July 2015, Green is the reader in the BBC Radio 4 panel game Quote... Unquote. Personal life Green is an avid reader who enjoys going to the theatre, concerts and art exhibitions. She is also a Trustee of the University of Kent Development Fund.

It reduces the possibility that unnecessary changes will be introduced to a system without forethought, introducing faults into the system or undoing changes made by other users of software. The goals of a change control procedure usually include minimal disruption to services, reduction in back-out activities, and cost-effective utilization of resources involved in implementing change. Change control is used in various industries, including in IT, software development, the pharmaceutical industry, the medical device industry, and other engineering/manufacturing industries. For the IT and software industries, change control is a major aspect of the broader discipline of change management. Typical examples from the computer and network environments are patches to software products, installation of new operating systems, upgrades to network routing tables, or changes to the electrical power systems supporting such infrastructure. Certain portions of the Information Technology Infrastructure Library cover change control.  The process  There is considerable overlap and confusion between change management, configuration management and change control. The definition below is not yet integrated with definitions of the others. Change control can be described as a set of six steps: # Plan / Scope # Assess / Analyze # Review / Approval # Build / Test # Implement # Close =Plan / Scope= Consider the primary and ancillary details of the proposed change. Should include aspects such as identifying the change, its owner(s), how it will be communicated and executed, how success will be verified, the change's estimate of importance, its added value, its conformity to business and industry standards, and its target date for completion. =Assess / Analyze= Impact and risk assessment is the next vital step. When executed, will the proposed plan cause something to go wrong? Will related systems be impacted by the proposed change? Even minor details should be considered during this phase. Afterwards, a risk category should ideally be assigned to the proposed change: high-, moderate-, or low-risk. High-risk change requires many additional steps such as management approval and stakeholder notification, whereas low-risk change may only require project manager approval and minimal documentation. If not addressed in the plan/scope, the desire for a backout plan should be expressed, particularly for high-risk changes that have significant worst-case scenarios. =Review / Approval= Whether it's a change controller, change control board, steering committee, or project manager, a review and approval process is typically required. The plan/scope and impact/risk assessments are considered in the context of business goals, requirements, and resources. If, for example, the change request is deemed to address a low severity, low impact issue that requires significant resources to correct, the request may be made low priority or shelved altogether. In cases where a high-impact change is requested but without a strong plan, the review/approval entity may request a full business case may be requested for further analysis. =Build / Test= If the change control request is approved to move forward, the delivery team will execute the solution through a small-scale development process in test or development environments. This allows the delivery team an opportunity to design and make incremental changes, with unit and/or regression testing. Little in the way of testing and validation may occur for low-risk changes, though major changes will require significant testing before implementation. They will then seek approval and request a time and date to carry out the implementation phase. In rare cases where the solution can't be tested, special consideration should be made towards the change/implementation window. =Implement= In most cases a special implementation team with the technical expertise to quickly move a change along is used to implement the change. The team should also be implementing the change not only according to the approved plan but also according to organizational standards, industry standards, and quality management standards. The implementation process may also require additional staff responsibilities outside the implementation team, including stakeholders who may be asked to assist with troubleshooting. Following implementation, the team may also carry out a post-implementation review, which would take place at another stakeholder meeting or during project closing procedures. =Close= The closing process can be one of the more difficult and important phases of change control. Three primary tasks at this end phase include determining that the project is actually complete, evaluating \\"the project plan in the context of project completion,\\" and providing tangible proof of project success. If despite best efforts something went wrong during the change control process, a post-mortem on what happened will need to be run, with the intent of applying lessons learned to future changes.  Regulatory environment  In a Good Manufacturing Practice regulated industry, the topic is frequently encountered by its users. Various industrial guidances and commentaries are available for people to comprehend this concept. As a common practice, the activity is usually directed by one or more SOPs. From the information technology perspective for clinical trials, it has been guided by another U.S. Food and Drug Administration document.

History  The label was formed by Amy Grant's managers (with Harrell being her brother-in-law), with the label's original intent to give new artist Kathy Troccoli a home after being rejected by the major labels at the time. Troccoli, Michael W. Smith, and Rich Mullins were the label's first three artists. In 1990 they signed a new distribution deal with Geffen Records. In 1992 50% of Reunion Records was sold to BMG and by 1995 the other half was also acquired by BMG. For a time following the BMG acquisition they distributed through RCA Records. From 1995 until 1996, it was part of Arista Records (a BMG company). In October 1996 the label was sold to Zomba Records. Through eventual consolidation, it is now part of Sony Music Entertainment.

It involves diverting the venous blood from the inferior vena cava (IVC) and superior vena cava (SVC) to the pulmonary arteries without passing through the morphologic right ventricle; i.e., the systemic and pulmonary circulations are placed in series with the functional single ventricle. The procedure was initially performed in 1968 by Francis Fontan and Eugene Baudet from Bordeaux, France, published in 1971, and simultaneously described in 1971 by Guillermo Kreutzer from Buenos Aires, Argentina and finally published in 1973 Indications The Fontan procedure is used in pediatric patients who possess only a single functional ventricle, either due to lack of a heart valve (e.g. tricuspid or mitral atresia), an abnormality of the pumping ability of the heart (e.g. hypoplastic left heart syndrome or hypoplastic right heart syndrome), or a complex congenital heart disease where a bi-ventricular repair is impossible or inadvisable. The single ventricle is doing nearly twice the expected amount of work because it has to pump blood for the body and lungs. Patients typically present as neonates with cyanosis or congestive heart failure. Fontan completion is usually carried out when the patient is 2‚Äì5 years of age, but is also performed before 2 years of age. Contraindications After Fontan completion, blood must flow through the lungs without being pumped by the heart. Therefore, children with high pulmonary vascular resistance may not tolerate a Fontan procedure. Often, cardiac catheterization is performed to check the resistance before proceeding with the surgery. This is also the reason a Fontan procedure cannot be done immediately after birth; the pulmonary vascular resistance is high in utero and takes months to drop. Fontan procedure is also contraindicated in those with pulmonary artery hypoplasia, patients with left ventricular dysfunction and significant mitral insufficiency.  Types  There are four variations of the Fontan procedure: * Ventricularization of the Right Atrium (The original Fontan's Technique) *Atriopulmonary connection (the original Kreutzer's Technique) * Intracardiac total cavopulmonary connection (lateral tunnel) (described by Marc De Leval and Aldo Casta√±eda, separately) * Extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection (described by Carlo Marceletti) Approach Coronal CT image in a 19-year-old patient with tricuspid atresia treated with bidirectional Glenn shunt and Fontan. The Fontan is usually done as a two staged repair. The first stage, also called a Bidirectional Glenn procedure or Hemi-Fontan (see also Kawashima procedure), involves redirecting oxygen-poor blood from the top of the body to the lungs. That is, the pulmonary arteries are disconnected from their existing blood supply (e.g. a shunt created during a Norwood procedure, a patent ductus arteriosus, etc.). The superior vena cava (SVC), which carries blood returning from the upper body, is disconnected from the heart and instead redirected into the pulmonary arteries. The inferior vena cava (IVC), which carries blood returning from the lower body, continues to connect to the heart. The second stage, also called Fontan Kreutzer completion, involves redirecting the blood from the IVC to the lungs. At this point, the oxygen- poor blood from upper and lower body flows through the lungs without being pumped (driven only by the pressure that builds up in the veins). This corrects the hypoxia and leaves the single ventricle responsible only for supplying blood to the body. Post-operative complications In the short term, children can have trouble with pleural effusions (fluid building up around the lungs). This can require a longer stay in the hospital for drainage with chest tubes. To address this risk, some surgeons make a fenestration from the venous circulation into the atrium. When the pressure in the veins is high, some of the oxygen-poor blood can escape through the fenestration to relieve the pressure. However, this results in hypoxia, so the fenestration may eventually need to be closed by an interventional cardiologist. In a 2016 review, Dr. Jack Rychik, head of the Single Ventricle Survivorship Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia summarized the long-term consequences of Fontan circulation as an \\"indolent and progressive state of heart failure\\" with predictable long term consequences on several organ systems. Chronic venous hypertension and lowered cardiac output are assumed to be at the root of lymphatic complications such as chylothorax, protein losing enteropathy and plastic bronchitis which may occur in the immediate post-operative period as well as in the medium term. New interventional and surgical strategies have been investigated to relieve the lymphatic complications associated with the Fontan circulation. Concerns about damage to the liver have emerged more recently, as the Fontan circulation produces congestion and lymphedema in this organ which leads to progressive hepatic fibrosis. Screening protocols and treatment standards are emerging in the light of these discoveries. The Fontan procedure is palliative  not curative  but in nearly 70% of the cases it can result in normal or near-normal growth, development, exercise tolerance, and good quality of life. However, in 20‚Äì30% of cases, patients will eventually require heart transplantation and given the long-term consequences of chronic venous hypertension and insidious organ damage, freedom from morbidity is unlikely in the long term.  History  Francis Fontan (left) and Guillermo Kreutzer (right) in 2009 The Fontan procedure was initially described in 1971 by Dr. Francis Fontan (1929‚Äì2018) from Bordeaux, France. Prior to this, the surgical treatment for tricuspid atresia consisted of creating a shunt between a systemic artery and the pulmonary artery (Blalock- Taussig shunt) or the superior vena cava and the pulmonary artery (Glenn shunt). These procedures were associated with high mortality rates, commonly leading to death before the age of one year. In an attempt to improve this, Fontan was engaged in research between 1964 and 1966 endeavouring to fully redirect flow from the superior and inferior vena cavae to the pulmonary artery. His initial attempts in dogs were unsuccessful and all experimental animals died within a few hours; however, despite these failures, he successfully performed this operation in a young woman with tricuspid atresia in 1968 with Dr Eugene Baudet. The operation was completed on a second patient in 1970, and after a third case the series was published in the international journal Thorax in 1971. Dr. Guillermo Kreutzer from Buenos Aires, Argentina (b. 1934) without any knowledge of Fontan's experience performed a similar procedure in july, 1971 without placing a valve in the Inferior Vena Cava inlet and introducing the concept of \\"fenestration\\" leaving a small atrial septal defect to serve as a pop-off valve for the circulation.

Forerunners The literary movement was associated with a revival of interest in Ireland's Gaelic heritage and the growth of Irish nationalism from the middle of the 19th century. The poetry of James Clarence Mangan and Samuel Ferguson and Standish James O'Grady's History of Ireland: Heroic Period were influential in shaping the minds of the following generations. Others who contributed to the build-up of national consciousness during the 19th century included poet and writer George Sigerson, antiquarians and music collectors such as George Petrie and the Joyce brothers, editors such as Matthew Russell (of the Irish Monthly), scholars such as John O'Donovan and Eugene O'Curry and nationalists such as Charles Kickham and John O'Leary. In 1882 the Gaelic Union established the Gaelic Journal (Irisleabhar na Gaedhilge), the first important bilingual Irish periodical with the help of Douglas Hyde, with David Comyn as editor. Developments The early literary revival had two geographic centres, in Dublin and in London, and William Butler Yeats travelled between the two, writing and organising. In 1888 he published Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry, a compilation of pieces by various authors of the 18th and 19th centuries.Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry, ed. by W. B. Yeats (London: Walter Scott, [1888]). He had been assisted by Douglas Hyde, whose Beside the Fire, a collection of folklore in Irish, was published in 1890. In London in 1892, along with T. W. Rolleston, and Charles Gavan Duffy, he set up the Irish Literary Society. Back in Dublin he founded the National Literary Society in the same year, with Douglas Hyde as first President. Meanwhile, the more radical Arthur Griffith and William Rooney were active in the Irish Fireside Club and went on to found the Leinster Literary Society. 1900 portrait of William Butler Yeats by his father, John Butler Yeats In 1893 Yeats published The Celtic Twilight, a collection of lore and reminiscences from the West of Ireland. The book closed with the poem \\"Into the Twilight\\". It was this book and poem that gave the revival its nickname. In this year Hyde, Eugene O'Growney and Eoin MacNeill founded the Gaelic League, with Hyde becoming its first President. It was set up to encourage the preservation of Irish culture, its music, dances and language. Also in that year appeared Hyde's The Love Songs of Connacht, which inspired Yeats, John Millington Synge and Lady Gregory. Thomas A. Finlay founded the New Ireland Review, a literary magazine, in 1894, which he edited until 1911, when it was replaced by Studies. Many of the leading literary lights of the time contributed to it.Thomas J. Morrissey, SJ Thomas A. Finlay SJ, 1848‚Äì1940, Educationalist, editor, social reformer. Four Courts Press, Dublin, 2004. In 1897 Hyde became editor, with T. W. Rolleston and Charles Gavan Duffy, of the New Irish Library, a series of books on Irish history and literature issued by the London publisher, Fisher Unwin. Two years later Hyde published his Literary history of Ireland. Yeats, Lady Gregory and Edward Martyn published a Manifesto for Irish Literary Theatre in 1897, in which they proclaimed their intention of establishing a national theatre for Ireland. The Irish Literary Theatre was founded by Yeats, Lady Gregory and Martyn in 1899, with assistance from George Moore. It proposed to give performances in Dublin of Irish plays by Irish authors.Foster (2003), pp. 486, 662. The Fay brothers formed W. G. Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company, focused on the development of Irish acting talent. The company produced works by Seumas O'Cuisin, Fred Ryan and Yeats. Around the turn of the century Patrick S. Dinneen published editions of Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar √âirinn, poems by Aog√°n √ì Rathaille and Piaras Feirit√©ar, and other works for the Irish Texts Society and the Gaelic League. He then went on to write the first novel in Irish, while continuing to work on his great Irish-English dictionary. On Easter Sunday 1900 Yeats' friend and muse, Maud Gonne, founded Inghinidhe na h√âireann (English: Daughters of Ireland), a revolutionary women's society which included writers Alice Furlong, Annie Egan, Ethna Carbery and Sin√©ad O'Flanagan (later wife of √âamon de Valera), and the actors M√°ire Quinn and Sara Allgood. The Irish- language newspaper Banba was founded in 1901 with Tadhg √ì Donnchadha as editor. The following year he also became editor of the Gaelic Journal. In 1903 Yeats, Lady Gregory, George Russell (\\"AE\\"), Edward Martyn, and Synge founded the Irish National Theatre Society with funding from Annie Horniman; Fred Ryan was secretary. The Abbey Theatre was opened by this society in Abbey Street on 27 December 1904. M√°ire Nic Shiubhlaigh played the name part in Cathleen Ni Houlihan. Yeats' brother Jack painted portraits of all the leading figures in the society for the foyer, while Sarah Purser designed stained glass for the same space. The new Abbey Theatre found great popular success. It staged many plays by eminent or soon-to-be eminent authors, including Yeats, Lady Gregory, Moore, Martyn, Padraic Colum, George Bernard Shaw, Oliver St John Gogarty, F. R. Higgins, Thomas MacDonagh, Lord Dunsany, T. C. Murray, James Cousins and Lennox Robinson.McCormack, W. J. (ed.). The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture, Blackwell Publishing, 28 January 2002. p. 7\\\\. In 1904 John Eglinton started the journal Dana, to which Fred Ryan and Oliver St John Gogarty contributed. In 1906 the publishing house of Maunsel and Company was founded by Stephen Gwynn, Joseph Maunsel Hone and George Roberts to publish Irish writers. Its first publication was Rush-light by Joseph Campbell.John Kelly, Ronald Schuchard: The Collected Letters of W.B. Yeats, 1905‚Äì1907 (2005). Oxford University Press. p. 87 Lady Gregory started publishing her collection of Kiltartan stories, including A Book of Saints and Wonders (1906) and The Kiltartan History Book (1909). The Irish Review was founded in 1910 by Professor David Houston of the Royal College of Science for Ireland, with his friends poet Thomas MacDonagh, lecturer in English in University College Dublin, poet and writer James Stephens, with David Houston, Thomas MacDonagh, Padraic Colum and Mary Colum and Joseph Mary Plunkett. The magazine was edited by Thomas MacDonagh for its first issues, then Padraic Colum, then, changing its character utterly from a literary and sociological magazine, Joseph Plunkett edited its final issues as literary Ireland became involved with the Irish Volunteers and plans for the Easter Rising. Plunkett published a collection of poems, The Circle and The Sword, the same year. Fellow travellers The movement co-existed with the growth of interest in the Irish language (Gaelic League), the Home Rule movement, the Gaelic Athletic Association, and other cultural organisations. It spawned a number of books and magazines and poetry by lesser-known artists such as Alice Furlong, Ethna Carbery, Dora Sigerson Shorter and Alice Milligan around the turn of the century. These were followed by the likes of George Roberts, Katharine Tynan, Thomas MacDonagh, Se√°n O'Casey, Seamus O'Sullivan and others up to the 1930s. It was complemented by developments in the arts world, which included artists such as Sarah Purser, Grace Gifford, Estella Solomons and Beatrice Elvery.

Constructed 1908-12, this is a residential estate of several buildings built on the banks of the Des Plaines River in Riverside, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. It is itself a National Historic Landmark and is included in another National Historic Landmark, the Riverside Historic District. History The Avery Coonley House (built 1908‚Äì12) in Riverside, Illinois, is located on a unique small peninsula surrounded by the Des Plaines River. Of the few estates that Frank Lloyd Wright developed, it is one of his largest and most elaborate prairie school- homes ever built. It is one of just three multi-building prairie complexes built by the famed architect. The other two are the Dana-Thomas House and the Darwin D. Martin House complexes. The Coonley house is also the first example in Wright's work of a zoned plan. The raised second floor includes three zones: The public area (living room and dining room), the bedroom wing (with its pendant guest wing) and finally the kitchen and servants areas. The original residence was over-9000-square-feet and built on a ten-acre parcel. The entrance halls, playroom and sewing room are on the ground floor. An entire complex of interrelated buildings with extensive raised and sunken gardens was designed by landscape architect Jens Jensen. The main structure of the Avery Coonley Estate is the public-living room wing, located on Bloomingbank Road and behind that facing Scottswood Road is the bedroom wing of the mansion. The complex also includes a separate stable-coach house and gardener's cottage (1911). Along with the Robie House, the Coonley Estate represents the maturation of Wright's Prairie Style, typified by wide overhanging eaves, bands of art glass casement windows, free-flowing interior spaces and the harmonious blending of site and structure. Avery Coonley, a Chicago industrialist and his wife, Queene Ferry of the Detroit-based Ferry Seed Company, were both heirs to industrial fortunes and had an unlimited budget to commission a new residence. The Coonleys had investigated Wright's other homes and told him that they saw in his work \\"the countenances of principle\\".Frank Lloyd Wright: Collected Writings, 1930-32, volume 2. Edited by Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, introduction by Kenneth Frampton (Rizzoli International Publications, Inc., New York City, 1992), p. 218. Wright stated in his autobiography that \\"This was to me a great and sincere compliment. So I put my best into the Coonley House.\\" Wright considered the Coonley House among his finest works and gave the Coonleys a residence that blended indoors and out and felt as much like a little village as a home, given the way the courtyards, buildings, and garden walls interconnected. He designed all the features and furnishings within the home, including rugs and textiles. The designs of the Coonley House were included in his 1907 exhibition at the Chicago Architectural Club. Construction began a year later. A philanthropic couple, The Coonleys had progressive beliefs which included early education for children. At the age of four years, their only daughter Elizabeth was too young to attend the local school. To educate her child and others, Queene Ferry requested that Wright design a kindergarten, The Avery Coonley School Playhouse, in 1912 on nearby Fairbank Road, a block away from the main residence. The art glass windows of the Coonley Playhouse feature one of Frank Lloyd Wright's most well known designs. A pattern based on balloons, confetti and American flags, very festive for the intended use of the structure, the design used in these windows was artistically striking and represents Wright's first departure from his signature style using only straight lines. Except for a few relatively plain panes, the windows of the Coonley Playhouse are now all replicas, the originals having been removed in the middle of the 20th century at a time when Wright's work was either being saved or dissected and sold for large sums of money. Many of the originals can be seen in museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and The Art Institute of Chicago which prominently displays one of the windows near its main entrance. The colored side of the art glass windows faced the inside of the house, while the side that faces exterior is white. The kindergarten school moved from the Coonley Playhouse in Riverside to a larger facility in Downers Grove in 1916 and eventually became a full K-8 elementary school and still exists today. The original Coonley Playhouse near the estate in Riverside is currently a private residence. Alterations to the Coonley Estate have been made through the years, by Wright and others. A year after the house was completed, Wright modified the terrace pavilion, adding bands of art glass doors and windows to allow more light into the second-floor living room and children's playroom below. A pergola with noticeable Asian influences was also added. Avery Coonley sold the house in 1921 to Peter Kroehler, a furniture manufacturer from Naperville, Illinois. Several architectural changes were made during this period including a sun-room addition to the south, the lily pond was converted into a swimming pool and a pool house was added - probably designed by Harry Robinson, an apprentice under Wright at both Oak Park and Taliesin. In 1952 the property was threatened with demolition to make way for 14 ranch homes. A compromise was reached that allowed developer Arnold Skow to divide the main house into north and south halves by inserting a firewall, build five new houses on the property and convert the gardener's cottage and stable into separate residences and addresses. The raised gardens were sold off and a modern house was built on the property. Even with these radical changes, the house retains nearly all of its original exterior and interior design details, including approximately 270 original art glass windows and doors. A heater for the swimming pool exploded on June 11, 1978, setting a fire that destroyed the living room of the main house and one of the bedrooms. In 2000 salvage and restoration work was performed on light screens and millwork on the north half of the house including stucco and roof repair, restoration of the original gravel driveway and the reconversion of the swimming pool back to the original lily pond. The entire north side of the house has been meticulously restored to its original splendor including the re-creation of the George Mann Niedecken living room mural as well as the decorative tulip designed tile frieze along with many light screens that surround the perimeter of the house. During his lifetime, Frank Lloyd Wright built approximately 532 homes, museums, and office buildings. Many have been demolished, but more than 400 Wright-designed buildings still stand. Of the approximately 2,500 NHLs in the United States, twenty-eight were designed by Wright. Included is The Avery Coonley House which is the largest privately owned Frank Lloyd Wright residence to be recognized by the United States Secretary of the Interior. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970.. The village of Riverside, founded in 1869 as the nation's first planned community, was designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted ‚Äì designer of both Central Park in New York City and Jackson Park (fairgrounds of the Chicago Columbian Exposition of 1893). The streets of Riverside wind and crisscross, forming small islands of houses and green space; quite a contrast to the strict grid of nearby Chicago.

For example, one can construct a 36¬∞ angle using compass and straightedge and proceed to quintisect it (divide it into five equal parts) using an Archimedean spiral, giving the 7.2¬∞ angle required to construct a pentacontagon.

It also has 6 more cyclic symmetries as subgroups: (Z50, Z25), (Z10, Z5), and (Z2, Z1), with Zn representing œÄ/n radian rotational symmetry. John Conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter.The Symmetries of Things, Chapter 20 He gives d (diagonal) with mirror lines through vertices, p with mirror lines through edges (perpendicular), i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for rotational symmetry. a1 labels no symmetry.

Morison was suspended by the presbytery in 1841 after publishing in the previous year a pamphlet entitled The Question, 'What must I do to be saved?' Answered under the pseudonym Philanthropos, and soon withdrew from the United Secession Church.ODNB entry for James Morison by Lionel Alexander Ritchie. Retrieved 26 August 2013. Pay- walled. His father, who was minister at Bathgate, and two other ministers, were deposed not long afterwards for similar opinions. The four met at Kilmarnock on 16 May 1843 (two days before the Disruption of the Free Church), and, on the basis of certain doctrinal principles, formed themselves into an association under the name of the Evangelical Union, for the purpose of countenancing, counselling and otherwise aiding one another, and also for the purpose of training up spiritual and devoted young men to carry forward the work and pleasure of the Lord. The doctrinal views of the new denomination gradually assumed a more decidedly anti-Calvinistic form, and they began also to find many sympathizers among the Congregationalists of Scotland. Nine students were expelled from the Congregational Academy for holding Morisonian doctrines, and in 1845 eight churches were disjoined from the Congregational Union of Scotland and formed a connection with the Evangelical Union. The Union exercised no jurisdiction over the individual churches connected with it, and in this respect adhered to the Independent or Congregational form of church government; but those congregations which originally were Presbyterian vested their government in a body of elders. In 1889 the denomination numbered 93 churches; and in 1896, after prolonged negotiation, the Evangelical Union was incorporated with the Congregational Union of Scotland. Keir Hardie was a lay preacher for the Evangelical Union; he converted to Christianity in 1897 and considered himself to be a Christian Socialist: \\"I have said, both in writing and from the platform many times, that the impetus which drove me first into the Labour movement, and the inspiration which has carried me on in it, has been derived more from the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth than from all other sources combined.\\"http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/keir- hardie Eric Liddell, a famous Olympian and missionary, was involved with this group.

It is licensed and distributed by New Atlanta from TagServlet Ltd based in Scotland. BlueDragon is also distributed and supported by BEA Systems on their Oracle WebLogic Server server platform. BlueDragon applications run on a variety of platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. It is mostly compatible with ColdFusion MX 7. In March, 2008 New Atlanta announced that the future versions of BlueDragon (Java EE editions) would be released as open source products. The open source version was released as Open BlueDragon (OpenBD) in December 2008.  Editions  BlueDragon is available in six editions: * BlueDragon Server * BlueDragon Server JX (similar to ColdFusion standalone editions) * BlueDragon for J2EE Application Servers (BD J2EE) * BlueDragon for the Microsoft .NET Framework (BD .NET) * BlueDragon, BEA WebLogic Edition (sold by BEA as a BEA product) * Open BlueDragon, an open source version of BlueDragon for J2EE. The first two editions are standalone servers which run on Windows, Linux, and OS X. With BD J2EE, CFML applications can be deployed on any J2EE server, enabling integration of CFML and J2EE as enabled in ColdFusion MX. BD, BEA WebLogic Edition, is a special edition based on BD J2EE for use with BEA's WebLogic Server. BD.NET extends the Microsoft .NET framework and IIS to permit deployment of CFML applications as native MS .NET web applications, offering integration between CFML and ASP.NET that is not possible with ColdFusion. The Server JX, J2EE, MS .NET, and BEA WebLogic editions of BlueDragon are commercial products which are available as 30-day unlimited trials which convert to a single-IP developer edition with no expiration. The Server edition, on the other hand, is free for deployment‚Äîthough not for hosting, redeployment, or (as of the 6.2 release) commercial use. There are no differences in CFML tags supported in the free Server edition, but it supports only ODBC drivers on MS Windows (and only MySQL or PostgreSQL on Linux and Mac OS X), it supports only IIS on MS Windows or Apache on Linux or Mac OS X, and does not support secured (SSL) connections. None of the limitations of the free Server edition exist in the commercial Server JX, J2EE, .NET, or BEA WebLogic editions. The .NET edition of BlueDragon runs on Microsoft's .NET platform, BD.NET enables CFML applications to leverage the .NET platform and allows for integration between CFML and ASP.NET as well as .NET objects. Open BlueDragon is an open source version of BlueDragon is released under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3). The chief differences between the open source and the J2EE version are the removal of commercial libraries (e.g., for PDF generation), The JTurbo JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server, and the BlueDragon Administrator application. It runs on any standard J2EE application server, such as Tomcat, JBoss or Jetty. The original version of BlueDragon was released in 2002.  Corporate adoption  MySpace used the .NET version of BlueDragon to power some of its online applications as of 2007.  Compatibility  Though BlueDragon 7.0 was designed to be compatible with Adobe ColdFusion MX 7.0.2, there are differences in the two CFML implementations. BlueDragon offers several advantages (tags, functions, and other functionality) not found in ColdFusion. Similarly, there are a few tags and functions found in ColdFusion that are not supported currently in BlueDragon.

He was born in the village of Anogeia in Crete, the largest of the Greek islands. He was the older brother of two other great musicians of Cretan music, Antonis Xylouris or Psarantonis () and Yiannis Xylouris or Psaroyiannis (). His songs and music captured the Greek psyche and demeanor, earning Xylouris the title, Archangel of Crete. Biography Xylouris' nickname \\"Psaronikos\\" can be understood from the island's history, as it is customary for people from Anogeia to bear such a name. The origin, as is typical for Cretans as well as Greeks in general, arose from an interesting story. Since Crete's independence from the Ottoman Empire came later than the birth of modern Greece in the 19th century, the Ottoman control on Crete was still in place when Xilouris' grandfather, Antonis, was still alive. He was widely known as \\"Psaronikos.\\" Antonis kept company with a group of men who stole from the Turks. If they met up with the dreaded Turk during their escapades, the group would quickly disperse, but Antonis would \\"catch up to the rest of them as if they were fish\\" since he was the fastest runner. Thereafter, he was the first of his family to be given the name 'Fishturk' (Greek: 'Œ®Œ±œÅœåœÑŒøœÖœÅŒ∫ŒøœÇ'), which then was changed to \\"Psarantonis\\" by placing the prefix \\"Psaro,\\" or \\"fish,\\" to his name. These nicknames were readily accepted by everyone who knew him, and he was forever known as \\"Psarantonis\\". Subsequently, males of his family and his descendants were given the prefix \\"Psaro\\": Psaronikos, Psarogiorgis, Psarantonis, etc. Early years and World War II Xylouris' early years were filled with a patriotic zeal for his ancestral village of Anogeia, well-known throughout Crete for their bravery. This would be tested in the adolescence of his youth, brought upon by the turmoil of war with the Axis powers. In 1941, Nikos Xylouris was four-years- old when he witnessed German paratroopers, the Fallschirmj√§ger, descending upon his island during the Battle of Crete. In 1944, Xylouris was eight-years- old when his hometown of Anogeia was razed to the ground by the German army. This was due to the complicity of its mayor and citizens for harboring Special Operations Executive (SOE) agents and Cretan resistance fighters in their village and for ambushing a detachment of German soldiers under the direction of Captain W. Stanley Moss.Beevor, Antony. Crete: The Battle and the Resistance, John Murray Ltd, 2005. The legendary SOE operative Captain Patrick Leigh Fermor had also been ensconced there during the kidnap of Heinrich Kreipe in May 1944 but escaped with his band of Cretan partisans at the Germans' approach.Leigh Fermor, Patrick. Abducting a General, John Murray, 2014 Xylouris and his family fled to another village in Crete and returned to Anogeia only until after the Germans had surrendered. After the war, Patrick Leigh Fermor loved singing Xylouris' song Filadem so much that his inner circle of friends began calling him by the newly-acquired sobriquet, Filedem (Greek: Œ¶ŒπŒªŒµŒΩœÑŒ≠Œº); countless others would follow and hold Xylouris' song in equally high regard). Music career He acquired his first lyre, or lyra (the three-stringed Cretan fiddle which is supported on the knee while playing), at the age of twelve and displayed great potential in performing local Cretan folk music. He had a gift for singing and playing the mandolin with his friend Giorgos Kalomiris. Equally enthralled by the music of Leonidas Klados, a well-known and skilled player of the lyra, he was convinced to become an apprentice under Klados' tutelage for two years. He began to ply his craft at village weddings, baptisms and other celebrations throughout Crete. Xylouris was 17-years-old when he started performances at the \\"Kastro,\\" a restaurant in Heraklion, which was a venue for folk and local Cretan music. However, the turning point in Nikos Xylouris' career occurred with a recording in 1958. Audiences marveled at his voice and wanted to hear more of this rising star. He first performed abroad in 1966 and won First Prize at the Sanremo Music Festival. The following year, he established the first Cretan music hall ‚Äî Erotokritos ‚Äî in Heraklion, Crete. The recording of Anyfantou followed in 1969, which became a huge success. Shortly thereafter, Xylouris began performances in Athens at the Konaki Folk Music Hall. Eventually, Athens became his new permanent residence. Political turmoil During the early 1970s, Xylouris' voice became identified not only with Cretan music but with the youth of Greece rebelling against the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974, which came to power after a coup d'√©tat. He embodied a new kind of popular, folk-music style which adapted verses of famous Greek poets, incorporating well-known poems into the music genre of the particular artist in the mantinada style. The emergence of this music, based on renowned Greek poets such as Nikos Gatsos, Yannis Ritsos, Giorgos Seferis, Kostas Varnalis, and Dionysios Solomos, was lifting and inspiring to the Greeks, much like Sofia Vembo had galvanized the Greek populace during the Second World War. Other Greek singers had also embraced this style, such as Yannis Markopoulos, Stavros Xarhakos, Christodoulos Halaris, and Christos Leontis. Xylouris' music was as much a thorn in the side of the Greek military junta and its colonels, as it was a beacon of hope to the Greek people. Acclaim Perhaps the most famous of all the poets adapted by Xylouris was Vitsentzos Kornaros, the 16th- century Cretan of Venetian roots, best known for his epic poem Erotokritos. In 1971, Xylouris was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque by the Acad√©mie Charles- Cros in France for his performance of the Cretan Rizitika album with Yannis Markopoulos. Although widely regarded for his many songs that motivated and encouraged his and other generations alike, Xylouris' signature accomplishment became his rendition of the traditional Cretan song, Filedem. This song is accompanied by captivating scenes of his beloved island and epitomized Cretan hospitality. Xylouris' unique voice embodied the struggle of the Cretan people and burned his name in their hearts and minds forever. Personal life Xylouris married a local Cretan named Ourania Melampianakis, the daughter of a prosperous family from Heraklion.http://greekodyssey.typepad.com/my_greek_odyssey/2007/09/nikos- xylouris.html They had a son and a daughter. Death Nikos Xylourins succumbed to lung cancer and metastasis to the brain after a long battle on 8 February 1980, in Piraeus, Greece. He was buried in the First Cemetery of Athens.

They have a repertoire of predominantly British traditional songs and tunes but also occasionally perform contemporary songs from various sources. Their instrumentation is based largely around Martin Carthy's guitar, Eliza Carthy's fiddle and the melodeons of Saul Rose (1996‚Äì2000 and 2007-date) and Tim Van Eyken (2000‚Äì2007) with other instruments regularly augmenting their recordings. The group also continue the strong unaccompanied vocal tradition established by Norma and Martin's previous family group The Watersons, from whom they are widely considered to have evolved. The group's first album Waterson:Carthy (1994) was performed largely as a trio, with notable contributions from Eliza's musical partner Nancy Kerr. Their second album Common Tongue (1996) featured a more diverse selection of guest musicians with significant contributions from melodeon player Saul Rose. Although at this stage Rose was not credited as a full group member he soon became a permanent member of the touring group and was credited as a full group member on the release of their third album Broken Ground (1999). Rose left shortly thereafter to take up a career in the pharmaceutical industry and was replaced by Tim van Eyken in 2000. This line-up went on to release the albums A Dark Light (2002) and Fishes & Fine Yellow Sand (2004) and to consolidate the group's reputation as an outstanding live band. Holy Heathens and the Old Green Man (2006), an album of seasonal songs on which they were joined by vocal trio The Devil's Interval (Jim Causley, Lauren McCormick & Emily Portman) was widely considered both a belated follow-up and an addendum to The Watersons' Frost & Fire (1965). The group had already re-established The Watersons' tradition of performing a pre-Christmas tour under the Frost & Fire banner and by December 2006 this had been expanded to include a Mummers Play, brass section and a more significant contribution from The Devil's Interval. Van Eyken had announced his intention to leave the group to concentrate on his solo career prior to the December 2006 tour and his eventual final show was a Waterson Family special performance on 12 May 2007 London's Royal Albert Hall. Saul Rose, having again taken up music full-time in May 2006, immediately rejoined and the group began touring again in June 2007. All four members of Waterson‚ÄìCarthy continue to conduct successful careers outside the group. Norma Waterson has released several solo albums and performs in an occasional duo with Martin Carthy. Martin Carthy is a member of Brass Monkey, performs in occasional duos with Dave Swarbrick (until Dave Swarbrick died in 2016 ‚Äì they last toured together in 2015), John Kirkpatrick and Eliza Carthy, and has a successful solo career stretching back over more than 50 years. Eliza Carthy has a successful solo career and performs in an occasional duo with Saul Rose. Saul performs with various ensembles including Faustus, Random, Morris Offspring and Dansaul. Martin, Norma and Eliza all occasionally perform with Blue Murder. Individually, Martin, Norma and Eliza have won or been nominated several times in the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and Waterson‚ÄìCarthy won awards for Best Group and Best Traditional Track (Raggle Taggle Gypsy) in 2000.

Originally released in 1997, the final version, 5.5.2, was released in May 2012. In January 2012 the rights to Fusebox were transferred from TeraTech to a team of five developers,Contributors - Fusebox who removed the rights and placed the framework in the hands of the community.Yahoo! Groups Fusebox was intended to be easy to learn and provide benefits by helping developers structure their code through a set of simple conventions. Fusebox also allowed advanced developers to build large applications, leveraging design patterns and object- oriented programming techniques if they wish. Overview Fusebox provided web application developers with a standardized, structured way of developing their applications using a relatively straightforward and easy to learn set of core files and encouraged conventions. In addition to the framework itself, Fusebox became closely associated with a Web application development methodology developed by its proponents known as \\"FLiP\\" (for Fusebox Lifecycle Process). (Many people refer to Fusebox as a \\"methodology\\", but in fact, it was a development framework. FLiP, however, is a methodology). The framework has been ported and used in ASP, JSP, Lasso, Perl/CGI and PHP as well, though the CFML and PHP versions of Fusebox were the only versions to gain momentum. Fusebox dealt primarily with the effort of wiring together view states (pages) with controller actions (form submits, etc.) and the front-end of the business-logic tier. The framework did not address creating and maintaining business logic such as database interaction or service layers Concepts =Fusebox, Circuits and Fuseactions= The original concepts behind Fusebox were based on the household idiom of an electrical fusebox that controls a number of circuits, each one with its own fuse. In a Fusebox web application, all requests are routed through a single point (usually \`index.cfm\` for CFML) and processed by the Fusebox core files. The application is divided into a number of circuits (usually in sub-directories) which are intended to contain related functionality. Each circuit in the application is further divided into small files called fuses that should perform simple tasks. As such, Fusebox is considered an implementation of the front controller, a common design pattern. URLs within a Fusebox web application are usually of the form \`index.cfm?fuseaction=cname.fname\` where \\"\`cname\`\\" is the name of a circuit and \\"\`fname\`\\" is an XML-defined \\"method\\" within that circuit known as a fuseaction. The query-string variable name \\"fuseaction\\" can vary depending on configuration parameters, so not all applications using Fusebox need to use the action variable \\"fuseaction\\". =Naming conventions= Fusebox encourages, but does not enforce, separation of presentation logic from business logic. It uses a number of file naming conventions to encourage this separation: presentation files begin with dsp (display) or lay (layout), database access files begin with qry (query) and general business files begin with act (action). Typical file names are in the format [prefix]_[filename] like dsp_loginform.cfm. Additional naming conventions are used by some Fusebox developers but these are the most common ones. =Exit Fuseactions= Another concept that Fusebox encourages is to parameterize any exit points in a web page, coding them as variables that are set in the circuit control file. These exit points are known as XFAs - eXit FuseActions. The idea is that by parameterizing the exit points in a web page, the flow of control can be updated more easily, allowing more reuse of web pages or fragments thereof. =FuseDocs= Associated with the framework, but not strictly part of it, is the concept of FuseDocs which is a semi-formalized form of documentation written in XML that specifies the inputs and outputs of each fuse file. There are third-party tools available which can use FuseDocs to do things like generate test harness code. History Fusebox had several major revisions over the years. In Fusebox 3, the control files were all written in the underlying programming language (e.g., fbx_Switch.cfm for CFML). Fusebox 4 and later versions use XML for the control files (fusebox.xml and circuit.xml), but other framework components are written using the underlying programming language (e.g. fusebox5.cfm, again for CFML). In theory, this helps improve tool support for the framework. It also allowed for the pre-parsing and generation of a single template for processing each fuseaction, greatly increasing performance. Fusebox 5.5 allows the XML files to be omitted if certain conventions are followed. =Fusebox (version 1)= Fusebox 1 grew out of a conversation on the CF-Talk mailing list in April 1998. Steve Nelson and Gabe Roffman are credited with creating the original Fusebox though the first Fusebox program was written by Josh Cyr. The methodology was constantly evolving and beyond a whitepaper and a handful of examples, no official documentation existed. Very few developers were exposed to Fusebox during these early days. =Fusebox 2= Craig Girard and Steve Nelson (along with Hal Helms and Nat Papovich) wrote a book, Fusebox: Methodology and Techniques, which was published in 2000 by Fusion Authority. Programmers who followed the practices described in the book were said to be doing \\"Fusebox 2.\\" =XFB= Hal Helms built upon Fusebox 2 and called his ideas eXtended FuseBox, or XFB. =Fusebox 3= Fusebox 3 (written primarily by Hal Helms, John Quarto-von Tivadar and Nat Papovich) was an effort by leading members of the Fusebox community to incorporate XFB and other ideas into a reusable library, known as the \\"core files.\\" A simple API allowed application code to communicate with the core files. Upon release in the fall of 2001, Fusebox became a framework rather than a methodology. A subsequent 3.01 release addressed minor issues. Fusebox 3 was something of a sea-change from Fusebox 2. Only the original principles remained relatively unchanged; a Fusebox 2 and Fusebox 3 application are structured very differently. =Fusebox 4= Fusebox 4 was a complete rewrite of Fusebox 3. The license for the core files (which is open source) is held by a private company owned by Hal Helms and John Quarto-von Tivadar: The Fusebox Corporation (which appears to be a defunct corporation). Fusebox 4.1 introduced some new XML grammar elements beyond those available in 4.0 that let you declare, instantiate and manipulate objects (COM, Java and ColdFusion Components) as well as web services. These features have provided Fusebox developers with the means of tying object-oriented models (i.e. business-logic) directly into their controllers. However, many Fusebox developers used object-oriented or highly structured models in earlier versions of Fusebox or in the current versions without use of these grammar elements. =Fusebox 5= In 2006, The Fusebox Corporation asked Sean Corfield to take the lead in developing the next iteration of Fusebox. Fusebox 5 was another complete rewrite with new features and improved performance. Fusebox 5 nearly completely maintained backwards-compatibility with Fusebox 4.1. In November 2006 The Fusebox Corporation transferred ownership of the core files and fusebox website to TeraTech under the guidance of TeraTech president and Fusebox speaker Michael Smith. TeraTech announced that Fusebox will remain open source and is seeking to increase community involvement in the project again. Fusebox 5.1 and all subsequent releases are licensed under the Apache Source License 2.0. In February 2007 the members of Team Fusebox met at the Frameworks conference in Bethesda Maryland and created a plan of action for community involvement using volunteers in nine different areas of Fusebox. =Fusebox 5.5= This release focused primarily on adding a set of conventions that allow the creation of Fusebox applications without XML configuration files. The use of these new features instead of XML is called \\"implicit Fusebox\\". * Alpha testing began in June 2007 * A Public Beta became available at Adobe MAX in October 2007 * The official release of Fusebox 5.5 became available at the beginning of December 2007 =Fusebox 5.5.1 and FuseNG= The release of Fusebox 5.5.1 in March 2008 was the last release by Sean Corfield. In August 2008, Adam Haskell took over development, but became frustrated with the Fusebox organization,Open Letter to Custodians of Fusebox and attempted to branch a new framework called FuseNG (NG for Next Generation, a Star Trek reference). FuseNG quickly lost steam and ended without a release.Final FuseNG Update =Fusebox 5.6= In January, 2012, a team of five community developers led by John Blayter announced on the Fusebox mailing list that they had obtained the rights and copyright of Fusebox from TeraTech. The framework code has had the copyright removed and is available at GitHub to encourage community participation. Fusebox 5.6 goals were announced, but were never implemented.Fusebox 5.6 - Fusebox See also * Comparison of web frameworks References External links * Official Website, Fusebox.org * Official Fusebox mailing list, at Yahoo Groups * An Introduction to ColdFusion frameworks, at Adobe DevNet * Fusebox 4 Review (sys-con.com, September 2003) * Fusebox 3 Feature (sys-con.com, November 2001) * Fusebox mailing list at House of Fusion Web development software CFML programming language Web frameworks ","title":"Fusebox (programming)"},{"id":"962984","title":"2nd Parachute Division (Germany)"},{"id":"962987","text":"Jim Cartwright (born 27 June 1958) is an English dramatist, born in Farnworth, Lancashire.

From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. It is one of the centres of the region \\"Z√°horie\\", between the Little Carpathians in the east and Morava River in the west and a cultural and economic hub for nearby villages such as Gajary, Kostoli≈°te, Veƒæk√© Lev√°re and Jakubov. The town is located on the large Prague-Brno-Bratislava highway, and many residents commute daily to Bratislava. The Little Carpathians mountain range with its network of signposted trails provides excellent opportunities for mountain biking. Etymology The origin of the name is uncertain. According to the first theory, the name refers to the Hungarian word malacka which means \\"piglet\\" in Hungarian and because the town seal features a pig. A drawback of this theory is that the Hungarian malacka is only a later borrowing from Slovenian and the name is older than the borrowing (Slovene mladec ‚Äì a young man, in wide meaning also a young animal; Slovak equivalent is ml√°denec). Other theories derive the name from Slovak ml√°ky (fens, swamps), ml√°ti≈• (to flail, to smash, thus a placename derived from ml√°ti≈• was Mlaky > Malacky) or from the name of the Malina creek (recorded as Maliscapotoca). History The name of the city was first mentioned in writing in 1206. During World War II, Malacky was captured on 5 April 1945 by troops of the Soviet 2nd Ukrainian Front. Famous Buildings and Sites The most prominent sites in Malacky include the Franciscan church of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, the so-called \\"Palffy Palace\\" and the renovated synagogue. The church includes a precise from 1653 of the so-called Holy Stairs (Scala Sancta) that Christ ascended to the Pretorium of Pilate. The Palffy Palace until recently was used as a hospital and is currently unoccupied. It has recently been acquired by the local municipality. Located in the center of Malacky is also a large renovated synagogue built in 1886 in Moorish Revival style which is now being used a cultural center. Adjacent to it there is sport arena \\"MALINA\\" containing two indoor swimming pools (25m and 12m) and a multifunctional hall used for handball, basketball, volleyball and indoor football. Economy Swedspan, a subsidiary of IKEA, operates a large lumber plant just south of the city. Additionally the Kuchy≈àa airbase, which is occasionally used by the US Air Force and other NATO air forces for training purposes, is located approximately east of the city. In September 2008, Slovak National Party (SNS) President J√°n Slota facilitated the erection of a large Slovak cross near Malacky as a demonstration of Slovak nationalism. Demographics According to the 2001 census, the town had 18,063 inhabitants. 96.68% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.02% Czechs and 0.51% Hungarians. The religious makeup was 70.35% Roman Catholics, 19.48% people with no religious affiliation, and 1.98% Lutherans. According to the 1910 census 75% were slovaks. People *Istv√°n Friedrich, prime minister of Hungary for three months in 1919, was born here. *Ernst Wiesner, modern architect who designed buildings in Brno, was born here. *Martin Benka, a Slovak painter and illustrator, was born near here and died here in 1971. *√Åd√°m Liszt, the father of composer and pianist Franz Liszt, was born here in 1776. *Ivan D√©rer, a Slovak politician, lawyer and journalist, was born here in 1884. *Ludwig Angerer, an Austrian photographer, was born here in 1827. *Karol Machata, a Slovak actor, was born here in 1928. *≈†tefan Lux, a Slovak Jewish journalist, was born here in 1888. *Samuel Mr√°z, (born 1997) footballer *Franti≈°ek Lukovsk√Ω, small business owner, who committed a suicide in 2002 in front of the tax office using self-made guillotine.

The story revolves around a romance between two teenagers, and it stars Noah Taylor, who appears again as Danny Embling, the protagonist of Duigan's 1987 film The Year My Voice Broke. It also stars Thandie Newton and Nicole Kidman. Flirting is the second in an incomplete potential trilogy of autobiographical films by Duigan. It was produced by Terry Hayes, Doug Mitchell, Barbara Gibbs and George Miller, and made by Kennedy Miller Studios, who also made the Mad Max Trilogy. The film won the 1990 Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film, as The Year My Voice Broke had in 1987.  Plot  Danny, now an awkward, underdeveloped 17-year-old, has been sent away by his parents to the all-male St. Albans boarding school in rural New South Wales, Australia, in the hopes he won‚Äôt become a delinquent. The year is 1965 and it has been some time since Danny has had any romantic relationship with a girl (his former love, Freya, from The Year My Voice Broke, left him at the end of the first film). Danny is the butt of jokes because of his stutter and long nose (for which he is nicknamed \\"Bird\\"). His only friend is Gilbert. At a school rugby game, he meets and slowly becomes interested in Thandiwe, a Ugandan-Kenyan-British girl (Ugandan father and Kenyan-British mother) attending the all-girls Cirencester Ladies‚Äô College across the lake, while her father, a political activist, is lecturing at university in Canberra. They later meet at a debate between the two schools, and covertly during a school dance. She is punished for leaving the dance without permission and is given chores by the prefect, Nicola. Thandiwe is later befriended by Melissa and Janet. Throughout the course of the school year, they foster a budding romance, despite the overbearing regulations inflicted upon them ‚Äî specifically racial politics and social conventions (Thandiwe is often regarded by the school authorities as rebellious and overtly sexual). After the performance of the musical, Danny introduces his parents to Thandiwe and her parents. They later decide to return to Uganda in response to the political turmoil there. Soon Thandiwe decides to return too, and lies about her true departure date, in order to spend the night in a motel with Danny. They are discovered, leading to his expulsion. Thandiwe writes to him regularly from Uganda, but then the letters stop coming. One day a letter arrives from Nairobi saying she is finally safe there.

It was filmed on location in Sydney, Bathurst, and Braidwood, New South Wales, including scenes at St Stanislaus College in Bathurst. Flirting features one of the last appearances by Nicole Kidman in an Australian-produced film before she made her transition to Hollywood (though she would return in later years to act in movies for director Baz Luhrmann); Kidman had previously worked with director Duigan on the Australian miniseries \\"Vietnam.\\" Actress Thandie Newton later said that starting at her audition, when she was 16, Duigan groomed and sexually abused her.

Later it was ranked number 46 on Entertainment Weeklys list of the 50 Best High School Movies. The New York Times film review of 6 November 1992 commented: :There is a kind of painless calm about \\"Flirting.\\" The film is simultaneously attractive and just a little dull. Mr. Duigan avoids melodrama, which is all to the good. Yet his gift for the acutely observed commonplace detail is neither strong nor original enough to transform the movie into something comparable to so many similar, better films. The best things about \\"Flirting\\" are the performances. Ms. Newton is delightful as Thandiwe, who is far more sophisticated than Danny and wise enough never to let him know it. Mr. Taylor is also good, although the troubled Danny is not an easy character to play. He's virtually the generic artist-as-a-young-man. Nicole Kidman appears in a supporting role as one of Thandiwe's older classmates, who is less of a snob than she first appears. The Washington Post of 20 November 1992 commented: :The movie is full of wonderful scenes: Newton caught hiding in a boys' toilet stall as the unsuspecting lads come in to shower, a line of uniformed boys ritualistically facing a row of ballroom-gowned girls at a school dance, and so on. \\"Flirting\\" is also full of amusing rejoinders and comments: \\"Remember her needs as well as yours,\\" suggests Taylor's friend with secondhand Kamasutra wisdom when Taylor heads toward an intended sensual tryst. \\"If you can give her pleasure, she'll be back for more.\\"  Awards  The film received the following 1990 AFI Awards: *Best Film (Terry Hayes, Doug Mitchell, George Miller) *Best Achievement in Editing (Robert Gibson) *Best Achievement in Production Design (Roger Ford) The film was also nominated for the following 1990 AFI Awards: *Best Achievement in Sound (Antony Gray, Ross Linton, Phil Judd) *Best Actor in Supporting Role (Bartholomew Rose) *Best Achievement in Cinematography (Geoff Burton)  See also  * Cinema of Australia  References   External links  * Entry for the film on the Australian Film Commission website Flirting at Oz Movies  * Flirting at the National Film and Sound Archive 1991 romantic drama films 1991 films Australian films Australian coming-of-age films Australian romantic drama films English-language films Australian independent films Boarding school films Films about interracial romance Films set in schools Films directed by John Duigan The Samuel Goldwyn Company films Films produced by George Miller Films produced by Doug Mitchell 1991 drama films ","title":"Flirting (film)"},{"id":"963023","text":"Titus is a 1999 film adaptation of William Shakespeare's revenge tragedy Titus Andronicus, about the downfall of a Roman general, the first theatrically- released feature film adaptation of the play. Starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange, it was the directorial debut of Julie Taymor, who co-produced with Jody Patton and Conchita Airoldi, and wrote the screenplay. The film was a co-production of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy; produced by Overseas Filmgroup and Clear Blue Sky Productions and released by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Plot A boy eating lunch in a 1950s-style kitchen plays war with his surrounding toys. A bomb blast outside the window frightens him under the table from where he is rescued and taken to an Amphitheatre, where an invisible audience cheers. An army resembling the Terracotta Army enters; Romans under the command of Titus Andronicus, the general at the center of the play, return victorious from war. They bring back as spoils Tamora, Queen of the Goths, her sons, and Aaron the Moor. Titus sacrifices Tamora's eldest son, Alarbus, so the spirits of his 21 dead sons might be appeased. Tamora eloquently begs for the life of Alarbus, but Titus refuses her plea. Caesar, the Emperor of Rome, dies. His sons Saturninus and Bassianus squabble over who will succeed him. The Tribune of the People, Marcus Andronicus, announces the people's choice for new emperor is his brother, Titus. He refuses the throne and hands it to the late emperor's eldest son Saturninus, much to the latter's delight. The new emperor states he will take Lavinia, Titus' daughter, as his bride to honor and elevate the family. She is already betrothed to Saturninus' brother, Bassianus, who steals her away. Titus' surviving sons aid in the couple's run for the Pantheon, where they are to marry. Titus, angry with his sons because in his eyes they're being disloyal to Rome, kills his son Mutius as he defends the escape. The new emperor, Saturninus, dishonors Titus and marries Tamora instead. Tamora persuades the Emperor to feign forgiveness to Bassianus, Titus and his family and postpone punishment to a later day, thereby revealing her intention to avenge herself on all the Andronici. During a hunting party the next day, Tamora's lover, Aaron the Moor, meets Tamora's sons Chiron and Demetrius. The two argue over which should take sexual advantage of the newly-wed Lavinia. Aaron easily persuades them to ambush Bassianus and kill him in the presence of Tamora and Lavinia, in order to have their way with her. Lavinia begs Tamora to stop her sons, but Tamora refuses. Chiron and Demetrius throw Bassianus' body in a pit, as Aaron directed them, then take Lavinia away and rape her. To keep her from revealing what she saw and endured, they cut out her tongue as well as her hands, replacing them with tree branches. When Marcus discovers her, he begs her to reveal the identity of her assailants; Lavinia leans towards the camera and opens her bloodied mouth in a silent scream. Aaron brings Titus' sons Martius and Quintus and frames them for the murder of Bassianus with a forged letter outlining their plan to kill him. Angry, the Emperor arrests them. Later on, Marcus takes Lavinia to her father, who's overcome with grief. He and his remaining son Lucius begged for the lives of Martius and Quintus, but the two are found guilty and are marched off to execution. Aaron enters, and tells Titus, Lucius, and Marcus the emperor will spare the prisoners if one of the three sacrifices a hand. Each demands the right to do so. Titus has Aaron cut off his (Titus's) left hand and take it to the emperor. Aaron's story is revealed to have been false, as a messenger brings Titus the heads of his sons and his own severed hand. In Renaissance semiotics, the hand is a representation of political and personal agency. With his hand chopped off, Titus has truly lost power.\\"Dismembering and Forgetting in Titus Andronicus\\", by Katherine A. Rowe, Shakespeare Quarterly, 45.3 (Autumn 1994), pp. 279-303 Desperate for revenge, Titus orders Lucius to flee Rome and raise an army among their former enemy, the Goths. Titus' grandson (Lucius' son and the boy from the opening), who helped Titus read to Lavinia, complains she will not leave his books alone. In the book, she indicates to Titus and Marcus the story of Philomela, in which a similarly mute victim \\"wrote\\" the name of her wrongdoer. Marcus gives her a stick to hold with her mouth and stumps. She writes the names of her attackers on the ground. Titus vows revenge. Feigning madness, he ties written prayers for justice to arrows and commands his kinsmen to aim them at the sky so they may reach the gods. Understanding the method in Titus' \\"madness\\", Marcus directs the arrows to land inside the palace of Saturninus, who is enraged by this added to the fact Lucius is at the gates of Rome with an army of Goths. Tamora delivers a mixed-race child, fathered by Aaron. To hide his affair from the Emperor, Aaron kills the nurse and flees with the baby. Lucius, marching on Rome with an army of Goths, captures Aaron and threatens to hang the infant. To save the baby, Aaron reveals the entire plot to Lucius, relishing every murder, rape and dismemberment. Tamora, convinced of Titus' madness, approaches him along with her two sons, dressed as the spirits of Revenge, Murder, and Rape. She tells Titus she (as a supernatural spirit) will grant him revenge if he will convince Lucius to stop attacking Rome. Titus agrees, sending Marcus to invite Lucius to a feast. \\"Revenge\\" offers to invite the Emperor and Tamora and is about to leave, but Titus insists \\"Rape\\" and \\"Murder\\" stay with him. She agrees. When she leaves, Titus' servants bind Chiron and Demetrius. Titus cuts their throats, while Lavinia holds a basin with her stumps to catch their blood. He plans to cook them into a pie for their mother. The next day, during the feast at his house, Lavinia enters the dining room. Titus asks Saturninus whether a father should kill his daughter if she is raped. When the Emperor agrees, Titus snaps Lavinia's neck, to the horror of the dinner guests, and tells Saturninus what Tamora's sons did. When Saturninus demands Chiron and Demetrius be brought before him, Titus reveals they were in the pie Tamora enjoyed, and kills Tamora. Saturninus kills Titus after which Lucius kills Saturninus to avenge his father's death. Back in the Roman Arena, Lucius tells his family's story to the people and is proclaimed Emperor. He orders his father Titus and sister Lavinia to be buried in the family monuments, Saturninus be given a proper burial, Tamora's body to be thrown to the wild beasts, and Aaron be buried chest-deep and left to die of thirst and starvation. Aaron is unrepentant to the end. Young Lucius picks up Aaron's child and carries him away into the sunrise. Cast * Anthony Hopkins as Titus Andronicus, victorious Roman General who declines a nomination for Emperor upon his return to Rome. Following a post-war ritual of executing the proudest warrior of his enemy, the vanquished Goths, Titus draws the ire of Tamora, unaware of her inevitable appointment as the Queen of Rome. * Jessica Lange as Tamora, defeated Queen of the Goths, who swears revenge against Titus and the Andronicus family for the atrocities visited upon her eldest son, an executed prisoner of war, using her newly claimed powers as Queen of Rome. * Alan Cumming as Saturninus, older brother to Bassianus and newly crowned Emperor of Rome. Spurned by his attempts at claiming Lavinia as his new bride, he forsakes the Andronicus family and turns instead to Tamora as his new bride. * Colm Feore as Marcus Andronicus, Roman Senator and staunch ally of his brother, the ailing Titus. * James Frain as Bassianus, one of the deceased emperor's sons and younger brother to Saturninus. * Laura Fraser as Lavinia, daughter of Titus and fianc√©e of Bassianus. * Harry Lennix as Aaron, servant and illicit lover to Tamora, and the chief architect of her vengeful plans against the Andronicus family. * Angus Macfadyen as Lucius, Titus' eldest son and loyal soldier. Following his failed attempts at freeing his condemned brothers, Lucius is banished from Rome and defects to the Goths, where he rallies a sizable army to challenge Saturninus. * Osheen Jones as Young Lucius, Titus' grandson and a key character who observes most of the key events. * Matthew Rhys as Demetrius, one of Tamora's sons. * Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Chiron, one of Tamora's sons. * Kenny Doughty as Quintus, one of Titus' sons. * Colin Wells as Martius, one of Titus' sons. * Blake Ritson as Mutius, one of Titus' sons. * Raz Degan as Alarbus, Tamora's eldest son who is sacrificed, setting the events of the play into motion. * Geraldine McEwan as the Nurse, who brings Aaron his son. * Bah Souleymane as Aaron's infant child Differences from the original text Apart from the deliberate anachronisms, the film follows the play quite closely. One of the experimental concepts in the film was that the character of Young Lucius (Titus' grandson) is initially introduced as a boy from the present who finds himself transported to the fantastical reality of the film. At the beginning of the film, his toy soldiers turn into Titus' Roman army. At the end, when Titus' son Lucius avenges his father by condemning the villainous Aaron to a painful death, the boy takes pity on Aaron's infant son, carrying him away from the violence as he walks slowly into the sunrise. This ending is perhaps more positive than the ending of other productions of the play, including Taymor's stage production, in which Young Lucius is fixated upon the \\"tiny black coffin\\" holding the dead infant. A Tale of Two Tituses  Shakespeare Quarterly (2002) Production =Development= Julie Taymor took Shakespeare's script, added various linking scenes without dialogue (while cutting some of the text) and set the play in an anachronistic fantasy world that uses locations, costumes and imagery from many periods of history, including Ancient Rome and Mussolini's Italy, to give the impression of a Roman Empire that survived into the modern era. The opening scenes commence with a heavily choreographed triumphal march of the Roman troops, complete with motorcycle outriders. The selection of music is similarly diverse.BFI  Sight & Sound  Titus (1999) =Filming= Principal photography took place at the Cinecitt√† studios in Rome and on location at various historic monuments. The arena that appears at the beginning and ending of the film is the Arena in Pula, Croatia. The Emperor's palace is represented by the Fascist Palazzo della Civilt√† Italiana in Rome. Some shots of tunnels and ruins were filmed at Hadrian's Villa in Rome. The forest scenes were shot at Manziana, near Rome. Titus' house is represented by an old house near an aqueduct in Rome, and the streets where he rounds up his conspirators are the Roman Ghetto.Julie Taymor, DVD commentary. Soundtrack The score to the film was created by Taymor's long-time friend and partner Elliot Goldenthal and is a typical Goldenthal soundtrack with an epic, inventive and dissonant feel. Reception =Box office= The film was a box office bomb, earning only $22,313 on its opening weekend due to its limited release in only two theaters, ranking number 57 in the box office. Its widest release in the US was only in 35 theaters, causing the film to earn only $2,007,290 in North America. Overseas, the film grossed $252,390 in Chile, Mexico, and Spain, culminating in a worldwide total of $2,920,616. =Critical response= Titus received a mixed response from critics. It holds a 57% score on Metacritic based on reviews from 29 critics indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews\\". Rotten Tomatoes reports a 68% approval rating based on 75 reviews with a weighted average of 6.54/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"The movie stretches too long to be entertaining despite a strong cast.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, making it a \\"Critic's Pick\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also praised Titus and gave it three and a half out of four stars, referring to the source material as \\"the least of Shakespeare's tragedies\\" and concluding, \\"Anyone who doesn't enjoy this film for what it is must explain: How could it be more?

Highway 65 is a four lane expressway between Interstate 694 (I-694) in Fridley to just north of State Highway 95 at Cambridge. The route continues as a two-lane roadway from Cambridge to its northern terminus at Littlefork in northern Minnesota. At in length, State Highway 65 is the third longest state route in Minnesota, after MN 23 and MN 1. Route description State Highway 65 serves as a south‚Äìnorth route between Minneapolis, Fridley, Blaine, Cambridge, Mora, McGregor, Nashwauk, and Littlefork in east‚Äìcentral and northeast Minnesota. The roadway is one of three Minnesota state-marked highways to carry the same number as an existing U.S. marked highway within the state, the others being Highways 61 and 169. Highway 65 as it crosses Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis State Highway 65 begins at a split from I-35W south of downtown Minneapolis. The ramps end at an intersection with Tenth Street South, and so does the State Highway 65 designation, due to MnDOT returning control of the section through downtown to the city in 2005. The State Highway 65 designation resumes at the intersection of Washington Avenue (County 152) and 3rd Avenue South at the north end of downtown Minneapolis. Highway 65 is signed locally as 3rd Avenue South in downtown Minneapolis. 3rd Avenue South leads to the Third Avenue (Mississippi River) Bridge and becomes Central Avenue upon crossing the river. After its intersection with Hennepin Avenue, the route becomes Central Avenue NE. Highway 65 is signed locally as Central Avenue NE for this section. Many Minnesota landmarks are located on Central Avenue NE including the Aveda Institute, the Heights Theater, and the National Sports Center. The route remains Central Avenue until separating in Ham Lake, except for a split in Fridley and Spring Lake Park between I-694 and US 10. The route is a divided highway from Minneapolis to Cambridge, with a speed limit, increasing to speed limit beginning in Ham Lake, just outside Blaine. For part of its route (23 miles), MN 65 runs concurrently with MN 27 in Kanabec and Aitkin counties between Woodland and Rice River Township. Savanna Portage State Park in Aitkin County is located northeast of the junction of Highway 65 and County Road 14 in Shamrock Township near McGregor. The park entrance is located on County Road 14 in nearby Balsam Township.Minnesota DNR website for Savanna Portage State Park - Link History State Highway 65 was authorized in 1934 and 1935. The route was numbered as an extension of old US 65\\\\. By 1940, the route was paved from Minneapolis to just north of McGrath in Aitkin County. By 1949, the route was paved as far north as Libby. By 1953, the route was paved north to its intersection with US 2 at Swan River in Itasca County. Sections of Highway 65 north of US 2 were paved in the 1960s and 1970s. The last section of Highway 65 paved was through the Nett Lake Indian Reservation in 2000. The expressway section of Highway 65 between I-694 in Fridley to Spring Lake Park was constructed on a new alignment in 1953. The Highway 65 expressway bypass in Cambridge was completed circa 1993. A portion of State Highway 65 used to be part of old US 65\\\\. US 65 still enters Minnesota from Iowa, but ends now in the city of Albert Lea, where it has a junction with Interstate 35. I-35 and I-35W roughly follow the same route old US 65 used to take from Albert Lea to downtown Minneapolis. Before the freeways were built, the original US 65 had followed Lyndale Avenue between Burnsville and Minneapolis. In July 2005, the eight-block-long section of State Highway 65 in downtown Minneapolis, between Washington Avenue and the junction of Tenth Street South with the on/off ramps to I-35W, was turned back to city maintenance. This turn-back leaves State Highway 65 with a gap through downtown. The ramps leading to/going from Minneapolis surface streets south to their junction with Interstate 35W are still part of State Highway 65 according to (on pg 613), as indicated by the MN 65 shields used on the updated mileposts along those ramps. It was the last Minnesota State Highway (along with Minnesota State Highway 55) to directly run through Downtown Minneapolis, ending a 70-year era in which Minnesota State Trunk Highways would have a segment running directly through Downtown Minneapolis. Highway 65 is designated as Legislative Route 105 between Washington Avenue and 37th Avenue Northeast, then as Constitutional Route 5 from Minneapolis to Swan River, then as Legislative Route 159 to Little Fork. The route is not marked with those numbers.

He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth round of the 2001 NFL Draft. Johnson was selected to the Pro Bowl with the Bengals in 2004 after leading the AFC team in rushing. He employed a bruising style of hard-nosed running that earned him the nickname the \\"Auburn Rambler.\\" Early life Johnson was born in Petersburg, Virginia, approximately 30 miles south of Richmond. His first name, \\"Burudi\\", is Swahili and means \\"cool'\\" and his middle name \\"Ali\\" represents his family's respect and admiration for Muhammad Ali. He began playing football at the age of six with the Ettrick Trojans of the Chesterfield Quarterback League. During his high school career, he played on both offense and defense for the Thomas Dale Knights under head coach Victor Williams, following in the footsteps of Ken Oxendine and William Henderson. During his career, he broke the school's rushing record which was held by his friend, mentor and coach, Henry Jefferson. After graduation, he enrolled at Butler Community College in El Dorado, Kansas. College career =Butler Community College= Johnson played for two years at Butler Community College. He helped lead Butler to two national championships, defeating Ricks College in 1998 and Dixie College in 1999. His most memorable performance came against Dixie College in the championship game in which he ran for 375 yards and scored seven touchdowns. He was subsequently named NJCAA \\"Player of the Year\\". Johnson was subsequently inducted into the NJCAA Hall of Fame.http://www.butlergrizzlies.com/sports/fball/National_Players_of_the_Year http://njcaa.org/sports/fball/2015-16/releases/-8-24-16-_2015_FOOT_HOF =Auburn= At Auburn University, Johnson finished his career with 324 rushing attempts for 1,567 yards (4.84 yards per rush average). His 324 rushing attempts was a school single-season record and his 1,567 rushing yards were the second-most in school history. He had ten games in which he rushed for 100 yards or more. He was named SEC player of the year and nominated for the Doak Walker Award, which was won by LaDainian Tomlinson. He was a sociology major. His fullback was Heath Evans, who would later go onto the NFL as well. NFL running back Ronnie Brown was also a teammate. Professional career =Pre-Draft= =Cincinnati Bengals= The Cincinnati Bengals selected Johnson in the fourth round (100th overall) of the 2001 NFL Draft. Johnson saw little playing time in his first two NFL seasons. He backed up four-time Pro Bowler Corey Dillon, the Bengals' leading rusher since 1997, and had just 17 carries and seven receptions. Dillon missed much of the 2003 season with injuries, and Johnson found himself in the starting lineup. He took full advantage of his opportunity, rushing for 957 yards and nine touchdowns, while adding another 146 yards on 21 receptions in just nine games. After Dillon was traded to the New England Patriots following the 2003 season, Johnson was named the starter. He started every game and set a franchise rushing record with 1,454 yards. In addition, he scored 12 touchdowns and was named to the AFC Pro Bowl team. Johnson was a major contributor in 2005 season, in which the Bengals reached the playoffs for the first time in 15 years. Johnson remained the starter as a punishing runner providing the running game needed to complement quarterback Carson Palmer and wide receiver Chad Johnson (Ochocinco). Chris Perry, former University of Michigan running back, joined the backfield as the Bengals' first round pick in the 2004 NFL Draft. At the end of the season, the Bengals finished with an 11-5 record, the team's first winning season since 1990. Johnson broke his own franchise record with 1,458 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns while also recording a career-high 23 receptions for 90 yards.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/J/JohnRu00.htm During the 2007 season, Johnson missed five games to injury, and he had only one game in which he rushed for over 100 yards.

The title is a parody of other games released for the N64 at the time, many of which were popular franchises with \\"64\\" suffixed (such as Super Mario 64). An updated version of the game, ClayFighter: Sculptor's Cut, released as a rental-only game in 1998, is currently the rarest and most valuable N64 game. It, along with Rakugakids was one of the only 2D fighting games released exclusively for the N64. Gameplay Like its predecessors, ClayFighter and ClayFighter 2: Judgment Clay, Clayfighter 63‚Öì uses stop motion animation and claymation as opposed to traditional computer animation to produce a unique effect. The arenas in ClayFighter 63‚Öì are unique in that each one, with several exceptions, houses multiple rooms; during fights players can punch or kick their opponents into different rooms and the fight will then continue in that room. There are 26 different rooms to fight in. The game itself parodies other fighting games. It uses a 3-level bar for super combos like in the Street Fighter Alpha series and uses parries like the Street Fighter III series, and many of the super attacks are noticeably variations of attacks from the Street Fighter series. It also features a combo system similar to Killer Instinct, although it makes fun of the combo names (for example, \\"Itty Bitty Combo\\", or \\"Triple Brown Betty Combo\\"). During battle players can use many different attacks which have their own strengths and weaknesses. Plot The Isle of Klaymodo is the resting place of \\"Bessie\\", the purple meteor that came crashing out of the sky onto Klaymodo Island. Bessie has the essential ingredient, Bawk Choy, necessary for Dr. Kiln's world dominating Mutagen. Klaymodo's chief baddies are the devious Dr. Kiln and local voodist Happy Harry Houngan. With a combination of laboratory experiments and voodoo spells, they've created an \\"interesting\\" assortment of hooligans to help them take over the world. These hideous henchmen include Bonker, a clown gone bad, and Ickybod Clay, the wonder from down under. Dr. Kiln is putting on the finishing touches on his top secret mutagen code named \\"Clayotic Claymorphisis\\" as Houngan walks through the lab door. When Houngan finds out about Dr. Kiln's secret formula the clay hits the fan. As the fight breaks loose the vial containing the mutagen breaks in Dr. Kiln's hand and begins to take on a life of its own. The condition begins to spread rapidly and Dr. Kiln has no choice but to amputate his own hand. As the hand hits the floor it scurries out of the lab and into the dense jungle of Klaymodo. Houngan quickly exits the lab in pursuit of the Hand as Dr. Kiln writhes in pain. Meanwhile, as Dr. Kiln deals with his newfound stump, a ship on a 3-hour tour capsizes just off of Rubbage Reef. The ship contains a lively crew of characters, each with their own agendas. There's Bad Mister Frosty¬Æ, a one time bad guy who's turned his life around and Kung Pow, a Wok cookery Chef Boy R' Clay. Taffyman and Blob round out the castaways of the SS Manure. Characters There are twelve characters in ClayFighter 63‚Öì, six from previous games in the ClayFighter series, four debuting in this game, and two from other game series. The first nine are available for play immediately, and the latter three are hidden characters (shown below) that can be unlocked with cheat codes or to finish the game with each character. All twelve characters from ClayFighter 63‚Öì appeared in the updated version of the game, ClayFighter: Sculptor's Cut, along with four new characters, increasing the total character roster to sixteen. =Default characters= *Bad Mr. Frosty The Fighting Snowman (voiced by Jim Cummings) Once again reformed, Bad Mr. Frosty is a grouchy snowman who seeks to halt Dr. Kiln's sinister plot, and reclaim the North Pole from Sumo Santa. Frosty battles by transforming his frozen body in various ways, creating snow balls, ice picks, and other such weapons. Frosty tends to punch and kick his opponents by leeringly growling \\"Call me Daddy!\\". He's one of the few characters to appear in all of the ClayFighter games, though his appearance has changed greatly in each game. He appears to be a parody of Frosty the Snowman. *Blob (voiced by Frank Welker) An amorphous green blob with a dopey grin, the Blob may not look like a skilled fighter at first glance. In actuality, Blob is a master of morphing, transforming his body into cannons, sledgehammers, boxing gloves, and many other weapons. Blob also has an appetite for living clay, and thinks nothing of gobbling up a downed opponent for a quick snack. Blob has also been in all three games in the series. In previous games, the Blob had a high-pitched voice and a sadistic grin, but for this outing he's been given a Quasimodo-like voice and a dopey expression. *Bonker (voiced by Rob Paulsen) A former children's entertainer, Bonker went insane years ago and now seeks revenge on anybody who laughed at him in his life. With a perpetual scowl on his face and a somber tone of voice, Bonker's homicidal mania belies his flamboyant dress and makeup. Attacking with cream pies, mallets, and a portable cannon, Bonker has many ways to make his enemies suffer. He returns from the first ClayFighter game, with a completely different design: the original Bonker had a manic grin and a cheerfully goofy voice. *Earthworm Jim (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) The mightiest worm in all creation, Earthworm Jim is vacationing on Claymodo Island when he hears of Doctor Kiln's mad scheme. Never one to let evil have its way, Jim springs into action, showcasing all the head-whipping, raygun- blasting, cow-dropping action his fans love. He's a guest character from his own series of games and Dan Castellaneta reprises his role from the cartoon series. In ClayFighter: Sculptor's Cut, Jim is only playable as a secret character. *Houngan (voiced by Jim Cummings) An evil Jamaican witch doctor and master of voodoo, Happy Harry Houngan has a sinister set of abilities to aid his quest of conquering the world with his black magic. Houngan's main weapon is his rubber chicken, which he has transformed into a zombie. Houngan also sports a juju staff, and a wooden tiki mask to use as a bludgeon (or a snowboard). Some of his attacks cause rotting zombie hands to reach out of the ground and grab his opponent. When he enters the Battle Stage he then rotates his head around which is parodying The Exorcist. *Ickybod Clay (voiced by Frank Welker) Ickybod Clay is a withered ghoul with a mushy Jack-o'-lantern for a head. Icky resides in his own haunted mansion, although his squeaky voice and rather geeky personality do not make him the terrifying fiend he aspires to be. Among his many attacks, he can throw his own head as a weapon, has a parody of the shoryuken called the Boo-Hoo Ken, and can teleport. He also appeared in the original ClayFighter, but with a more whispery and creepy voice. His name is a parody of Ichabod Crane. *Kung Pow (voiced by Jess Harnell) Rather resembling a bucktoothed Bruce Lee, Kung Pow is a Chinese chef who is also skilled in the martial arts. He wears a white gi, and his dialogue is peppered with bland tidbits of dubious \\"oriental\\" wisdom. Most of Kung Pow's attacks are named after Chinese food (like Egg foo young, chop suey, etc.), and he uses utensils such as chopsticks, woks and meat cleavers as weapons. His name is a reference to Kung Pao chicken. *T-Hoppy The Battle Bunny (voiced by Charlie Adler) A cyborg rabbit, T-Hoppy was created as a living weapon by Doctor Kiln (by combining an unexplainably disfigured Hoppy from ClayFighter 2 with mechanical implants) until he rebelled against his creator. Now T-Hoppy fights to destroy Kiln and regain peace of mind. In addition to great physical strength and cybernetic implants, T-Hoppy is also an accomplished stage magician. In ClayFighter 2, Hoppy had an Austrian accent, poking fun at Arnold Schwarzenegger (Even though he didn't have his implants at the time), and the T in his name refers to Arnold's role as The Terminator, but Adler chose to go with a generic drill sergeant-style voice to fit his new design. Hoppy is also the only new character from ClayFighter 2 to return, as all of the new characters from that game were removed. *Taffy (voiced by Tress MacNeille) A former circus freak and partner of Bonker, Taffy is a bizarre creature made entirely out of, fittingly enough, taffy. This gives him incredible flexibility and agility. Taffy also carries gumballs as throwing weapons and carries a pair of six-shooters. He frequently imitates Curly Howard of The Three Stooges, especially Moe's \\"Oh, a wise guy, eh?\\" line. This vocal similarity was more noticeable in the original ClayFighter, where Taffy originated. =Unlockable characters= *Boogerman (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) Another hero from previous Interplay games, Boogerman joins the Clayfighters to save the day and show up his old rival Earthworm Jim. Boogerman uses bodily emissions such as mucus, belches, and explosive flatulence against his foes. He can also summon a barrage of falling toilets. *Dr. Kilnklein (often referred to as Dr. Kiln) (voiced by Charles Adler) Dr. Generic Kiln is the main villain of the piece. After being indirectly responsible for the chaos in ClayFighter 2 (he is mentioned in the ClayFighter 2 manual, but doesn't appear in the game itself), his latest scheme is to transform the entire world into clay, which he can then mold into whatever he wishes. His hand has been replaced with a piece of clay. This new hand can transform into a propeller, a machine gun, a chainsaw, jumper cables, a scalpel, and other dangerous weapons. Meanwhile, his lost hand grew, gained sentience, and became High Five, a hidden character in Sculptor's Cut. With his opaque eyeglasses, hunched back and thick Germanic accent, Dr. Kiln is very much the consummate mad scientist. *Sumo Santa (voiced by Jim Cummings) An evil duplicate of Santa Claus clad in little more than a loincloth. Megalomaniacal Sumo Santa has conquered the North Pole as his own, and only Frosty stands in his way. Grotesquely obese but surprisingly agile, Sumo Santa enjoys using his ponderous girth to smash the competition flat. Development ClayFighter 63‚Öì was developed by Interplay Entertainment as an entry in its ClayFighter series that originated on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The project, under the working title ClayFighter 3, was produced by Jeremy Airey, who had helped create previous titles in the franchise alongside designers Eric Hart and Rodney Relosa. With the ClayFighter series, the development team's goal was to build a legitimate fighting game while comically parodying popular franchises in the same genre such as Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and Killer Instinct. Airey explained that this meant replacing the extreme violence from said franchises with either gross or humorous action. \\"Buckets of blood and gore get boring after awhile,\\" Airey stated. \\"We want to make a game that stays fresh [...] We think this sort of thing works better than gore because each character has something unique and funny to show.\\" After being dissatisfied with the results of the clay animation in ClayFighter 2, Interplay contacted Danger Productions for the new game's character models and stop motion as it had done on the original ClayFighter. Once the game's characters were sketched out by the artists at Interplay, Danger made the illustrations into maquettes for plastic molds, which were then formed into models with clay, foam, and wire. Interplay directed Danger in filming these figures in various positions with stop motion photography against backlighting. Finally, Interplay digitized the photographs and linked the animation, sound, and player input together with computer scripting tools. These tools had been created during the short production of ClayFighter 2 but had not been fine-tuned until work began on the third entry in the series. Newer technology allowed Interplay to give the game the aesthetic that they had originally envisioned for the ClayFighter series. Development took place for the 3DO M2, then the N64. Airey and the rest of the staff found the N64's software development kit much simpler than that of the M2, though during development Airey expressed regret that the N64 lacked a CD- ROM drive. The N64 allowed the team to render the characters within 3D environments and easily maintain 24-bit color depth. Airey stated that the project team also implemented \\"Spillits\\" (bits of clay similar to blood or impact stars in other games) that spill out in all directions in 3D space whenever a character is hit. For the audio in ClayFighter 3, Interplay hired a sound director from Disney when recording the game's character voice-overs from talent including Rob Paulsen, Frank Welker, and Dan Castellaneta, among others. The sound team recorded 30 to 40 different voice lines for each character. The game also features the voice of famous ring announcer Michael Buffer, who provides commentary throughout each round. Release ClayFighter 63‚Öì was initially announced in the fall of 1995 as a launch game for the then- upcoming M2 console. By the middle of 1996, the game was still slated as a front-runner in the prospective console's library. In the third quarter of that same year, prior to the M2's eventual cancellation, Interplay announced that production on ClayFighter 3 had shifted to Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's N64. The game resurfaced under the name ClayFighter Extreme in late 1996; it was then retitled ClayFighter 63‚Öì in early 1997 for its imminent release on the N64. The planned PlayStation version of the game was cancelled for being behind its intended release schedule. According to an Interplay representative, this incarnation of the game was cancelled because it was not scheduled for a simultaneous release with ClayFighter 63‚Öì; the developer did not want PlayStation owners to perceive the game as a mere port of the N64 version. Clay Fighter Sculptor's Cut by Interplay ClayFighter 63‚Öì suffered many delays and was released almost a year after it had previously been scheduled. The magazine Nintendo Power even ran a cover story and an early review of the game in its June 1997 issue. Prior to shipping ClayFighter 63‚Öì, Interplay altered the combat system, changed many fighters' movesets, and removed five of the original seventeen playable characters from the roster due to space limitations. The game quietly went on sale in North America on October 23, 1997 and in Europe the following month. Clay Fighter Sculptor's Cut Interplay later updated ClayFighter 63‚Öì with a \\"special edition\\" titled ClayFighter: Sculptor's Cut, which was released as a Blockbuster Video rental exclusive in North America on May 15, 1998. Although this version could only be rented and not purchased from the video chain, Blockbuster did give customers the opportunity to win a copy of the game through an online contest. Sculptor's Cut contains new storylines, easier menu navigation, further adjustments to the combat system, a new introduction sequence with vocal lyrics, and other minor changes. Most prominently, Sculptor's Cut re-added four of the five characters that were removed for the game's first release, in addition to the original twelve fighters. The fifth character removed from ClayFighter 63‚Öì was Hobo Cop, depicted as a homeless vigilante that consumes alcohol. Hobo Cop was not featured in Sculptor's Cut because Nintendo did not approve of the character. The following four characters are exclusive to ClayFighter: Sculptor's Cut: *High Five (voiced by Tress MacNeille) Dr. Kiln's severed hand, mutated by chemicals and transformed into a sentient being. High Five has a deep resentment for his former host, and despite his physical limitations, is a skilled \\"hand-to-hand combatant\\". It is unknown whether High Five is a right hand or a left hand, since the fighters are reversed when they cross sides of the screen during gameplay. In terms of gameplay, High Five appears to be unfinished, since he has no ducking Brutal Kick, only one super attack, and no Claytalities. *Lady Liberty (voiced by Tress MacNeille) The Statue of Liberty transformed by Dr. Kiln into a living clay creature. Like T-Hoppy, Lady Liberty turned on her creator and seeks to destroy him. Lady Liberty's main weapon is her famous torch, which can be used as a flamethrower. *Lockjaw Pooch (voiced by Frank Welker) Although marked as killed in the production of the original Clayfighter 63‚Öì (\\"This animal was severely injured during the making of this game\\"), Lockjaw returns to ravage the competition in the Sculptor's Cut. A vicious junkyard dog granted sentience by Dr. Kiln's experiments, the ever-loyal Lockjaw puts his powerful fangs to good use in battle. *Zappa Yow Yow Boyz (voiced by Frank Welker) Three little pygmy brothers who are the bane of Houngan's existence. Although short and squat, the Boyz are a force to be reckoned with when they climb onto each other's shoulders for battle, as well as summoning their pet goat. The Boyz are cannibalistic, and enjoy tossing defeated opponents into a boiling kettle for dinner. Reception and legacy ClayFighter 63‚Öì was met with mixed to negative critical reception. The game held an aggregate score of 47.96% on GameRankings based on 13 reviews. While most reviewers found the game's humor and parody to be successful, they also felt its weakness in every other area left it with no long-term appeal. Next Generation, for example, stated that \\"What's so likable about Clay Fighter 63 1/3 - in fact, about the only thing that's likable - is that it's just so damn silly, and it parodies its targets pretty squarely. Anyone who's played, or even watched someone else play Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, or Killer Instinct ... will find the characters, their moves, and voice-overs hilarious. ... In the end, most gamers will have a difficult time slapping down $69.99 for this comic-tragic game. How much of a price do you put on a good, if short-lived chuckle?\\" Critics lambasted the game for using sprite-based graphics, derivative mechanics, weak AI, and choppy animation. GamePro summarized, \\"Slow action, forced humor, fuzzy speech, frustrating combos, cheesy A.I.‚Äìthe game's practically a laundry list of What Not To Do Without Good Gameplay.\\" Matt Casamassina predicted that ClayFighter 63‚Öì would \\"remain a prominent title in the N64 library for years to come\\" because the game \\"is so terrible it sets the standards for bad\\". Contrarily, the editors of Nintendo Power, who reviewed the game in both its unreleased and released forms in June and November 1997 respectively, were much more positive. Sushi-X also defended the game in Electronic Gaming Monthly, arguing that while it is unenjoyable in a traditional fighting game sense, it makes a great party game. His three co-reviewers held closer to the majority opinion, saying the game is funny but would eventually get old. According to Toy Retail Sales Tracking, ClayFighter 63‚Öì sold around 60,000 copies prior to Christmas in 1997. The Sculptor's Cut version of the game remains one of the rarest North American N64 games. It was released as a Blockbuster rental deal and got little distribution at an estimated 20,000 copies according to contemporary sources. Because of this limited distribution and the poor treatment games usually got at video rental stores, boxes and instruction manuals are extremely rare and their value has vastly increased in recent years. In September 2009, Interplay announced that they would update the ClayFighter series for the WiiWare and DSiWare services with ClayFighter: Call of Putty. Development was being handled by StudioBlack Games, which included Eric Hart, a programmer on the original ClayFighter. The title of this installment is a parody of the Call of Duty series, a series of popular first-person shooters. Nintendo Power revealed that Call of Putty would feature all the gameplay, fighters, and modes available in ClayFighter: Sculptor's Cut and an expected release date in late 2010 or early 2011. However, after continuous delays, the game is currently listed as TBA release status on Interplay's website. The book Game Level Design by Ed Byrne, has Interplay comment in 1999 that \\"Clayfighter broke a million on the Nintendo 64, and we expect a similar result once the popular Earthworm Jim franchise comes to the world of 3D this year.\\" They did not mention if the Sculptor's Cut edition was part of that figure.

In algebra, a finitely generated group is a group G that has some finite generating set S so that every element of G can be written as the combination (under the group operation) of finitely many elements of the finite set S and of inverses of such elements. By definition, every finite group is finitely generated, since S can be taken to be G itself. Every infinite finitely generated group must be countable but countable groups need not be finitely generated. The additive group of rational numbers Q is an example of a countable group that is not finitely generated.  Examples  * A group that is generated by a single element is called cyclic. Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers Z. A locally cyclic group is a group in which every finitely generated subgroup is cyclic. * The free group on a finite set is finitely generated by the elements of that set. * Every quotient of a finitely generated group G is finitely generated; the quotient group is generated by the images of the generators of G under the canonical projection. * A subgroup of a finitely generated group need not be finitely generated. * A fortiori, every finitely presented group is finitely generated. See Presentation of a group#Examples for several examples. * See Generating set of a group#Examples for more examples. Finitely generated Abelian groups The six 6th complex roots of unity form a cyclic group under multiplication. Every Abelian group can be seen as a module over the ring of integers Z, and in a finitely generated Abelian group with generators x1, ..., xn, every group element x can be written as a linear combination of these generators, :x = Œ±1‚ãÖx1 \\\\+ Œ±2‚ãÖx2 \\\\+ ... + Œ±n‚ãÖxn with integers Œ±1, ..., Œ±n. Subgroups of a finitely generated Abelian group are themselves finitely generated. The fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups states that a finitely generated Abelian group is the direct sum of a free Abelian group of finite rank and a finite Abelian group, each of which are unique up to isomorphism. Subgroups A subgroup of a finitely generated group need not be finitely generated. The commutator subgroup of the free group F_2 on two generators is an example of a subgroup of a finitely generated group that is not finitely generated. On the other hand, all subgroups of a finitely generated Abelian group are finitely generated. A subgroup of finite index in a finitely generated group is always finitely generated, and the Schreier index formula gives a bound on the number of generators required. In 1954, Albert G. Howson showed that the intersection of two finitely generated subgroups of a free group is again finitely generated. Furthermore, if m and n are the numbers of generators of the two finitely generated subgroups then their intersection is generated by at most 2mn - m - n + 1 generators. This upper bound was then significantly improved by Hanna Neumann to 2(m-1)(n-1) + 1, see Hanna Neumann conjecture. The lattice of subgroups of a group satisfies the ascending chain condition if and only if all subgroups of the group are finitely generated. A group such that all its subgroups are finitely generated is called Noetherian. A group such that every finitely generated subgroup is finite is called locally finite. Every locally finite group is periodic, i.e., every element has finite order. Conversely, every periodic abelian group is locally finite.  Applications  Geometric group theory studies the connections between algebraic properties of finitely generated groups and topological and geometric properties of spaces on which these groups act. Related notions The word problem for a finitely generated group is the decision problem whether two words in the generators of the group represent the same element. The word problem for a given finitely generated group is solvable if and only if the group can be embedded in every algebraically closed group. The rank of a group is often defined to be the smallest cardinality of a generating set for the group. By definition, the rank of a finitely generated group is finite.

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. action thriller film directed by William Friedkin and based on the novel by former U.S. Secret Service agent Gerald Petievich, who co-wrote the screenplay with Friedkin. The film features William Petersen, Willem Dafoe and John Pankow among others. Wang Chung composed and performed the original music soundtrack. The film tells the story of the lengths to which two Secret Service agents go to arrest a counterfeiter. Plot Richard Chance and Jimmy Hart are United States Secret Service agents assigned as counterfeiting investigators in its Los Angeles field office. Chance has a reputation for reckless behavior, while Hart is three days away from retirement. Alone, Hart stakes out a warehouse in the desert thought to be a print house of counterfeiter Rick Masters. After Masters and Jack, his bodyguard, kill Hart, Chance explains to his new partner, John Vukovich, that he will take Masters down no matter what. The two agents attempt to get information on Masters by putting one of his criminal associates, attorney Max Waxman, under surveillance. Vukovich falls asleep on watch, and consequently they fail to catch Masters in the act of murdering Waxman. While Vukovich wants to go by the book, Chance becomes increasingly reckless and unethical in his efforts to catch Masters. While Chance relies on his sexual-extortion relationship with parolee/informant Ruth for information, Vukovich meets privately with Masters' attorney, Bob Grimes. Grimes, acknowledging a potential conflict of interest that could ruin his legal practice, agrees to set up a meeting between his client and the two agents, who engage Masters by posing as bankers from Palm Springs interested in Masters' counterfeiting services. Masters is reluctant to work with them, but ultimately agrees to print them $1 million worth of fake bills. In turn, Masters demands $30,000 in front money, which is three times the authorized agency limit for buy money. To get the cash, Chance persuades Vukovich to aid him in robbing Thomas Ling, a man whom Ruth previously told Chance is bringing $50,000 cash to purchase stolen diamonds. Chance and Vukovich intercept Ling at Union Station and seize the cash in an industrial area. Ling's cover people follow them and while observing the robbery, open fire and accidentally fatally shoot Ling. Chance and Vukovich try to evade them through the streets, freeways and even one of the flood control channels, before a final escape by going the wrong way on the freeway. The next day, the end of their daily briefing includes an FBI bulletin that Ling was its undercover agent, kidnapped, robbed and murdered while on a sting operation. Only a generic description of the assailants and their vehicle is given. While Chance and Vukovich did not kill Ling, Vukovich is nonetheless consumed by guilt, while Chance is apathetic and focused solely on getting Masters. Unable to persuade Chance to come clean about their role in Ling's death, Vukovich meets with Grimes, who advises him to turn himself in and testify against Chance in exchange for a lighter sentence. Vukovich refuses to implicate his partner. Chance and Vukovich meet with Masters for the exchange. After inspecting the counterfeit million, the agents attempt to arrest Masters and Jack, but Jack pulls a shotgun. Jack and Chance fatally shoot each other, and Masters escapes. Vukovich gives chase, going to a warehouse a previous informant had told them about. By the time he arrives, Masters has set fire to everything inside, destroying all evidence. Vukovich confronts Masters and during a brief struggle, Masters asks Vukovich why he did not take Grimes' advice to turn his partner in, revealing that Grimes was working on Masters' behalf all along. While Vukovich is stunned at the revelation, Masters grabs a board and knocks him unconscious. Masters then covers Vukovich with shredded paper and is about to set him on fire when Vukovich wakes up and shoots Masters. Masters drops his lighter and accidentally sets himself ablaze, while Vukovich empties his gun on the burning man, killing him. Vukovich visits Ruth as she packs up to leave L.A. He mentions Chance's death, deducing she had known all along that Ling was FBI. He knows Chance had left her with the remaining cash that his agency now wants back, but Ruth says she needed it to pay debts she owed. Vukovich declares that Ruth is working for him now, turning into the same \\"whatever it takes\\" agent that his partner was.

Duffy as Leon * Gary Cole as Max Production Director William Friedkin was given Gerald Petievich's novel in manuscript form and found it very authentic. The filmmaker was also fascinated by the \\"absolutely surrealistic nature\\" of the job of a Secret Service agent outside Washington, D.C. When the film deal was announced, Petievich was investigated by a rival for a pending office promotion, and felt \\"a lot of resentment against me for making the movie\\" and \\"some animosity against me in the Secret Service\\" existed, exacerbated by the agent in the Los Angeles field office who suddenly resigned a few weeks after initiating the investigation. SLM Productions, a tribunal of financiers, worked with Friedkin on a ten- picture, $100 million deal with 20th Century Fox but when the studio was purchased by Rupert Murdoch, one of the financiers pulled the deal and took it to MGM. =Casting= Friedkin had a $6 million budget to work with while the cast and crew worked for relatively low salaries. As a result, he realized that the film would have no movie stars in it. William Petersen was acting in Canada when asked to fly to New York City and meet with the director. Half a page into his reading, Friedkin told him he had the part. The actor was drawn to the character of Chance as someone who had a badge and a gun and how it not only made him above the law, but also \\"above life and death in his head\\". The actor found the experience of being this character and making the film \\"amazing\\" and \\"intoxicating\\". He called fellow Chicago actor John Pankow and brought him to Friedkin's apartment the day after being cast as Chance, recommending him for the role of Vukovich. The director agreed on the spot. Former Secret Service agent and author Gerald Petievich, who wrote the book the film is based on, appears in a cameo as a fellow Secret Service agent. =Screenplay= The basic plot, characters, and much of the dialogue of the film is drawn from Petievich's novel, but Friedkin added the opening terrorist sequence, the car chase, and clearer, earlier focus on the showdown between Chance and Masters. Petievich said that Friedkin wrote a number of scenes but when there was a new scene or a story in need to be changed, he wrote it. The director admits that Petievich created the characters and situations and that he used a lot of dialogue but that he wrote the screenplay, not Petievich. =Principal photography= The director wanted to make an independent film and collaborate with people who could work fast, like cinematographer Robby M√ºller and his handpicked crew who were non-union members. Friedkin shot everything on location and worked quickly, often using the first take to give a sense of immediacy. He did not like to rehearse but would create situations where the actors thought they were rehearsing a scene when actually they were shooting a take. Friedkin did this just in case he got something he could use. To this end, he let scenes play out and allowed the actors to stay in character and improvise. For example, during the scene where Chance visits Ruthie at the bar where she works, Friedkin allowed Petersen and actress Darlanne Fluegel to devise their own blocking and told M√ºller, \\"Just shoot them. Try and keep them in the frame. If they're not in the frame, they're not in the movie. That's their problem\\". The shot of Petersen running along the top of the dividers between the terminal's moving sidewalk at the Los Angeles International Airport got the filmmakers into trouble with the airport police. The airport had prohibited this action, mainly for Petersen's safety, as they felt that their insurance would not have covered him had he hurt himself. The actor told Friedkin that they should do the stunt anyway so the director proposed that they treat it like a rehearsal but have the cameras rolling and shoot the scene, angering airport officials. The counterfeiting montage looks authentic because Friedkin consulted actual counterfeiters who had done time. The \\"consultant\\" actually did the scenes that do not show actor Willem Dafoe on camera to give this sequence more authenticity even though the actor learned how to print money. Over one million dollars of counterfeit money was produced but with three deliberate errors so that it could not be used outside the film. The filmmakers burned most of the fake money but some leaked out, was used, and linked back to the production. The son of one of the crew members tried to use some of the prop money to buy candy at a local store and was caught. Three FBI agents from Washington, D.C. interviewed 12-15 crew members including Friedkin who screened the workprint for them. He offered to show the film to the Secretary of the Treasury and take out anything that was a danger to national security. That was the last he heard from the government. The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway sequence was one of the last things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. He fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered how he was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in The French Connection then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's stressed out reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget. Adding to the chaotic feeling of the chase, Friedkin staged it so that the freeway traffic flow was reversed. That is that the normal traffic in the scene has the drivers driving on their left in the left hand lanes (as in Britain) while the cars driving against the flow were driving on their right (as would be usual in North America). =Post-production= As early as the day he cast Petersen, Friedkin thought about killing off Chance towards the end of the film, but according to editor Bud Smith, Vukovich was supposed to be the one who was killed. The climactic scene in which Chance is killed was not very well received by MGM executives, who found it to be too negative. To satisfy the studio heads, he shot a second ending, in which Chance survives the shotgun blast and, presumably as an internal punishment, he and Vukovich are transferred to a remote Secret Service station in Alaska, and watch their boss Thomas Bateman being interviewed on television. Friedkin previewed the alternate ending and kept the original. Reception =Box-office= To Live and Die in L.A. premiered in the United States on November 1, 1985 in 1,135 screens where it grossed $3.6 million on its opening weekend behind Death Wish 3. It went on to make $17.3 million in the United States and Canada, well above its $6 million budget. =Critical response= Roger Ebert, film critic for the Chicago Sun- Times, gave the film four out of four stars and wrote that \\"the movie is also first-rate. The direction is the key. Friedkin has made some good movies...and some bad ones. This is his comeback, showing the depth and skill of the early pictures\\". He went on to praise Petersen, \\"a Chicago stage actor who comes across as tough, wiry and smart. He has some of the qualities of a Steve McQueen\\". Critic Janet Maslin was dismissive of the film, and wrote \\"Today, in the dazzling, superficial style that Mr. Friedkin has so thoroughly mastered, it's the car chases and shootouts and eye-catching settings that are truly the heart of the matter\\". David Ansen, critic for Newsweek, wrote \\"Shot with gritty flamboyance by Robby Muller, cast with a fine eye for fresh, tough-guy faces, To Live and Die in L.A. may be fake savage, but it's fun\\". The staff at Variety gave the film a mixed review and wrote that it was over the top: \\"To Live and Die in L.A. looks like a rich man's Miami Vice. William Friedkin's evident attempt to fashion a West Coast equivalent of his 1971] The French Connection is engrossing and diverting enough on a moment-to-moment basis but is overtooled...Friedkin keeps dialog to a minimum, but what conversation there is proves wildly overloaded with streetwise obscenities, so much so that it becomes something of a joke\\". In his scathing review for the Washington Post, Paul Attanasio wrote \\"To Live and Die in L.A. will live briefly and die quickly in L.A., where God hath no wrath like a studio executive with bad grosses. Then again, perhaps it's unfair to hold this overheated and recklessly violent movie to the high standard established by Starsky and Hutch\\". Movie historian Leonard Maltin seemed to agree with Attanasio, giving TLADILA 1.5 stars out of a possible four: \\"Try to imagine Miami Vice on the West Coast...here you have it. This picture is so gritty that it's hard to root for anybody...since the good guys are as foul-mouthed, greedy, and sadistic as the bad guys...! For a crack Secret Service agent and a master counterfeiter, both Dafoe and Petersen act pretty dumb; Friedkin delivers one of the most spectacular car chases since his own French Connection, along with a galvanizing score by Wang Chung, but even that's not enough to counteract the bad taste this film leaves behind.\\" Jay Scott, in his review for The Globe and Mail, wrote \\"Pity poor Los Angeles: first the San Andreas fault and now this. The thing about it is, To Live and Die in L.A., for all its amorality and downright immorality, is a cracker-jack thriller, tense and exciting and unpredictable, and more grimy fun than any moralist will want it to be\\". Time criticized its \\"brutal, bloated car-chase sequence pilfered from Friedkin's nifty The French Connection\\", and called it \\"a fetid movie hybrid: Miami Vile\\". Almost two decades later, a review in The Digital Fix called the film \\"A sun-bleached study in corruption and soul-destroying brutality, this film by the notoriously erratic but sometimes brilliant William Friedkin is nasty, cynical and incredibly good.\\"The Digital Fix. Staff DVD review. December 7, 2003. Accessed: August 8, 2013. The film was voted as the 19th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with two criteria: \\"The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list\\". =Accolades= Wins * Cognac Festival du Film Policier: Audience Award; William Friedkin; 1986. * Stuntman Awards: Stuntman Award; Best Feature Film Vehicular Stunt, Dick Ziker and Eddy Donno; Most Feature Film Spectacular Sequence, Dick Ziker; 1986. =Impact= Although criticized at the time for the lack of accomplished celebrities in its cast, many of the actors have become established stars, most notably Willem Dafoe, William Petersen, John Pankow, Jane Leeves, and John Turturro. Soundtrack According to Friedkin, the main reason he chose Wang Chung to compose the soundtrack was because the band \\"stands out from the rest of contemporary music ... What they finally recorded has not only enhanced the film, it has given it a deeper, more powerful dimension\\". He wanted them to compose the score for his film after listening to the band's previous album, Points on the Curve. He was so taken with the album that he took one of the songs straight off the album, \\"Wait\\", and used it as part of the soundtrack. \\"Wait\\" plays at the end credits of the film. Every song on the soundtrack, excluding the title song and \\"Wait\\", was written and recorded within a two-week period. Only after Wang Chung saw a rough cut of the film did they produce the title song. An original motion picture soundtrack was released on September 30, 1985, by Geffen Records. The album contained eight tracks. The album's title song, \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\", (with a music video also directed by Friedkin), made it on the Billboard Hot 100 where it peaked at #41 in the United States. Home media A DVD was released by MGM Home Entertainment on December 2, 2003. The DVD contains a new restored wide-screen transfer, an audio commentary featuring director Friedkin where he relates stories about the making of the movie, a half-hour documentary featuring the main characters, a deleted scene showing a distraught Vukovich bothering his soon-to-be ex-wife at her apartment, and the alternate ending Friedkin refused to use, in which the two Secret Service partners survive but are transferred to Alaska while their supervisor Bateman is promoted and takes credit for stopping Masters. On February 2, 2010, the film was released on Blu-ray not containing all of the previous special features that were included on the DVD release. On November 22, 2016, Shout Factory released a Collector's Edition, restoring the original DVD's special features and adding new ones.https://www.shoutfactory.com/product/to-live-and- die-in-l-a-collector-s-edition?product_id=4799 Car chase The car chase in this film has consistently been ranked in the top 5 best car chase sequences on film, usually appearing in various one to five positions through the years with The French Connection (another Friedkin directed film), The Seven-Ups, The Blues Brothers, Ronin and the gold standard and first of the famous car chase film sequences, Steve McQueen's Bullitt.Fandango: The All Time Top 10 Car Chases https://www.fandango.com/movie-photos/the-all-time-top-10-movie- car-chases-65,Popular Mechanics: Best Car Chases in Movie History https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/g217/best-movie-car-chases/Business Insider.

It is the first book in The Deptford Histories trilogy, a series of prequels to Jarvis's Deptford Mice books. Set in 17th century London, it serves as a backstory for the original trilogy's main antagonist, Jupiter. It was first published in the United Kingdom in 1991 by Macdonald Young Books. In 2004, it was published in the United States by Chronicle Books as The Alchemist's Cat. Synopsis In London in 1664, an orange tabby cat named Imelza encounters a black cat she comes to call Master Midnight. When asked his real name, he identifies himself only as Imp. Imelza is seduced by him and he impregnates her that night. Shortly after his entire family dies of smallpox, young Will Godwin of the town of Adcombe is invited to London by an uncle he has never met. He asks his neighbour, John Balker the miller, to accompany him there. Despite the older man's misgivings and concerns for Will's safety, he agrees to do so. Will's first night in London is disastrous. He and Mr. Balker are told that Will's uncle will meet them at a seedy tavern called the Sickle Moon, but he fails to show up. The miller becomes drunk and as Will is leading him from the establishment, the two are attacked by a pair of ruffians. They murder Mr. Balker, but before they can turn their attention to Will, a man appears and scares them away by a show of what seems to be magic. The man introduces himself to Will as an apothecary named Elias Theophrastus Spittle. He hides Will in his shop before convincing the gathering crowd outside that it was the lad who killed Mr. Balker. Will tries to protest, but Spittle says that it would be wiser for him to remain silent, lest he incur the wrath of the mob. Now a fugitive, Will has no choice but to become the apothecary's servant to ensure his silence. Partly for disguise and partly to demean him, Spittle cuts the boy's hair short. When Will attempts to climb the stairs to the apothecary's private quarters, he is immediately shooed away and told never to go there again. Still he is intrigued by the crimson-painted door. While Spittle is away, Will takes the opportunity to explore the upper floor, and finds a room filled with the paraphernalia of a wizard. The apothecary catches him and is about to severely punish him when Will offers his assistance in gathering whatever magical ingredients the man might need. Spittle is pacified, and when Will asks if he is a wizard, he says that though he has studied the black arts, he is an alchemist rather than any sort of magician. It is his goal to find the Philosopher's Stone. One night, Spittle sends Will out to fetch the hair of a hanged man. He is successful, but gets the attention of the night watchman. Forced to flee, he takes refuge in the graveyard of the church of St. Anne. Suddenly, a series of howls pierce the night, frightening off the pursuing night watchman. Will follows the source of the sound and finds Imelza, having given birth to a litter of kittens. She and her small family are half-dead with cold and starvation. Taking pity on them, Will carries them back to Spittle's apothecary shop. Will persuades Spittle, who is searching for immortality, to take one of the cats as a familiar. Spittle chooses Jupiter, a strong and healthy ginger tabby, whom he trains in the magic arts. However, Spittle hates the ugly black runt, and names him Leech out of spite. Spittle has no interest in the tortoiseshell female, whom Will calls Dab. Due to Spittle favouring his brother, Leech becomes murderously envious of him. Spittle takes Will and his new familiar to St. Anne's cemetery to call forth the spirit of a wizard from the previous century, Magnus Augustus Zachaire, to aid him in his search for the Philosopher's Stone. Zachaire's spirit does appear, but is angry at being disturbed and wishes to return to his grave. Spittle, however, traps him in a bottle which he carries back to the shop. Unwilling to help Spittle before, the furious Zachaire now absolutely refuses to do so, but Spittle says he will not release him until he finds the Stone. The Bubonic plague begins and spreads throughout London. Although Imelza and Dab escape from Spittle, Imelza is beaten to death by a frightened mob blaming animals for the spread of the plague. Will's friend Molly, working as a plague doctor, saves Dab from near death. When Dab returns home, Spittle takes her away and murders her in the night for an anatomical experiment. Leech is the only witness to Dab's abduction, but refuses to help her due to her having called specifically for Jupiter's help rather than his. Jupiter and Leech battle over who is heir to the black arts. When Zachaire reveals to Spittle that he lengthened his life through a magic potion called the Elixir of Life, Spittle puts his quest for the Philosopher's Stone on hold in favour of recreating it instead. Later, when Spittle succumbs to the plague and dies, Jupiter reveals his ability to talk to Will and the two finish the alchemist's work on the Elixir of Life to resurrect him. It is at this point that Will learns that Spittle is in fact his uncle, who lured him to London to take his inheritance. Spittle tries to murder Will, and Jupiter is at first hesitant to stop him as he doesn't want to betray his master. But when he discovers his sister Dab's preserved corpse, he is filled with rage and drinks the potion himself, turning on Spittle. He has a magical duel with Spittle and a fire breaks out. Using the power of the Elixir of Life, Zachaire summons his skeleton from the grave and becomes human again. He and Spittle put aside their differences and are about to escape the burning shop when Zachaire suddenly changes his mind. Wanting to die once more, he drags Spittle into the fire with him. Leech betrays Jupiter and leaves him to burn to death, inheriting his brother's magic powers. Leech then falls into the fire himself. Will escapes the burning capitol city with Molly, who turns out to have been John Balker's estranged daughter. The two of them make plans to return to Adcombe. Will reveals that he has rescued one of the cats, so terribly burned that it is impossible to tell which it is. Later, the cat is revealed to be Leech. Having drunk the Elixir of Life as well as a hair tonic that changes his sable fur to ginger, Leech convinces a rat once kept by Spittle to take him to the sewers. Leech takes his brother's name and title as his own: \\"Jupiter, Lord of All\\". The book gradually weaves both story lines together. Both the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London appear in the story. Development Jarvis chose the setting of The Alchymist's Cat from reading the diaries of Samuel Pepys and said he \\"spent ages revelling in the research. Plague and the Great Fire - I couldn't wish for a better backdrop!\\" He imagined the character Dr. Spittle to appear similar to comic actor Alastair Sim. However, when creating the first edition's cover painting, Jarvis used his barber as a reference. He says the scene where Spittle cuts Will's hair was included as a nod to him. Reception Sally Estes of Booklist called the novel a \\"creepy, atmospheric horror tale\\" and a \\"vivid tale of treachery, cruelty, and sorcery, leavened only by Will's innate goodness.\\" Kirkus Reviews called it \\"a crackerjack creepfest\\" and added that \\"Jarvis's florid, purple-tinged prose presents Londonwith her filthy alleys and crime-ridden alehouses, her overgrown cemeteries and plague-haunted streetsas a major player in the unfolding disaster. Meanwhile, ghastly revelations pile upon grisly tableaus as the plot hurtles towards a spectacular final conflagration amidst London's Great Fire.\\" Christine McGinty of School Library Journal said \\"The book is filled with adventure, suspense, and a feeling of dread. However, parts of it move very slowly, particularly in the beginning. Still, Jarvis closes with an unexpected cliff-hanger that will have readers craving more books about Jupiter.\\" Unproduced film adaptation In late 2004, Robin Jarvis announced on his website that a film adaptation of The Alchymist's Cat was to be made the following year. The script would be written by Richard Carpenter. Jarvis found it a \\"fantastically exciting prospect\\" and added that \\"the actors that are being mentioned in connection with it are the best around.\\" However, no further updates were ever given about the project, and it can be assumed that it was ultimately scrapped for reasons unknown. Carpenter passed away in 2012.

Electoral Prince of Bavaria Engraving of Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria He was born in Munich. He was the eldest son of Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria - whom he succeeded, and his second wife Maria Anna of Austria, daughter of the emperor Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. Born during the reign of his father, he was known as the Electoral Prince from birth. Through his mother, he was a first cousin of Queen Mariana of Spain as well as Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. On 8 December 1650 he married Henriette Adelaide of Savoy, daughter of Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy and Christine Marie of France. The couple had seven children, two of which would have progeny. Elector Still a minor he succeeded his father in 1651, his mother was his guardian and his uncle Albert VI of Bavaria served as Prince Administrator of Bavaria for three years. Ferdinand Maria was crowned on 31 October 1654. His absolutistic style of leadership became a benchmark for the rest of Germany. Though Ferdinand Maria allied with France he abstained the imperial crown in 1657 after the death of his uncle Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor to avoid a conflict with the House of Habsburg. Ferdinand Maria supported the wars of the Habsburg against the Ottoman Empire with Bavarian auxiliary forces (1662‚Äì1664). During the Franco-Dutch War since 1672 Bavaria was officially neutral. Plans for a Bavarian colony near New York were discussed but soon abandoned. The marriage of his eldest daughter Maria Anna Victoria and her cousin le Grand Dauphin in 1680 was the outcome of the Bavarian alliance with France. Ferdinand Maria was the great grandfather of French monarch King Louis XV. Ferdinand Maria modernized the Bavarian army and introduced the first Bavarian local government code. The elector did much indeed to repair the wounds caused by the Thirty Years' War, encouraging agriculture and industries, and building or restoring numerous churches and monasteries. In 1669, moreover, he again called a meeting of the diet, which had been suspended since 1612. The electorate he left with a very wealthy treasury. He died at the Old Schleissheim Palace and was succeeded by his son Maximilian II Emanuel. He was buried in the crypt of the Theatiner Church in Munich. Cultural legacy Copperplate engraving by Michael Wening Starnberg Castle with Ferdinand Maria's gondola Bucentaurus in Topographia Bavariae about 1700 Ferdinand Maria married Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy in 1650; and with her, the Italian Baroque was introduced in Bavaria. The Theatiner Church in Munich was built from 1663 onwards as a gesture of thanks for the birth of the long-awaited heir to the Bavarian crown, Prince Maximilian II Emanuel. After that in 1664, Ferdinand Maria and his wife commissioned the building of the Baroque style Nymphenburg Palace near Munich based on the designs of Italian architect Agostino Barelli. Lake Starnberg was purchased by Ferdinand Maria from the Horwarth family and it became the venue of numerous festivities of the court with the famous fleet of Venetian Gondolas. On the lake's shores, he ordered the construction of Berg Castle in 1676. The castle was used for festivities there and later reached its zenith when it became the scene of spectacular entertainments and hunts under the rule of his successors, Maximilian Emanuel and Emperor Charles VII. For the Munich Residenz, Ferdinand Maria ordered the creation of the Papal Rooms.

Early years and family life Holcomb attended Lincoln County High School in Fayetteville, Tennessee, and was a student and a lettered in football as a quarterback, baseball as a shortstop, and basketball and led his football team to the 1990 Tennessee State Championship. He and his wife Lori have four kids: Kellyn, Jake, Jalyn, and Jameson. College career Holcomb played college football at Middle Tennessee State University. During his freshman season in 1991, his near-perfect performance versus then No. 1 ranked Florida State at Doak Campbell Stadium versus a secondary that featured future NFL players Terrell Buckley and Clifton Abraham put him on the map. For the day, Holcomb completed 20 of 28 passes for 188 yards in his first college start. He finally broke out statistically as a Senior, throwing for over 2,000 yards with 15 TD. *1991: 130/209 for 1,763 yards with 5 TD vs 4 INT.http://www.totalfootballstats.com/Team_College.asp?id=108&Season;=1991 *1992: 92/168 for 1,409 yards with 9 TD vs 6 INT. *1993: 133/240 for 1,738 yards with 7 TD vs 6 INT. *1994: 146/244 for 2,154 yards with 15 TD vs 9 INT. Professional career =World League of American Football= Holcomb was quarterback for the now-defunct Barcelona Dragons of World League of American Football in 1996. =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= Holcomb spent the 1995 season on the Buccaneers practice squad. He was released in 1996, as the Buccaneers opted to go with Scott Milanovich as the team's No. 3 quarterback. =Indianapolis Colts= Holcomb was signed by the Indianapolis Colts as a street free-agent in 1996. His first season he didn't play a regular season game. In 1997 a disappointing season, Holcomb played five games and started one in which he threw only one touchdown and eight interceptions. Holcomb never saw action in a regular season game for the Colts again. =Cleveland Browns= A backup to Peyton Manning of Indianapolis, Holcomb was cut in the 2000 off-season to be allowed to compete for the starting job with the Cleveland Browns, following Bruce Arians who left as the QB coach of the Colts to become the offensive coordinator of the Browns. The Browns had drafted Tim Couch with the number 1 pick in the 1999 draft. During their time in Cleveland, Holcomb occasionally outshined the former number one pick. In his first season as a Brown, Holcomb played in only one game which he completed seven of twelve passes for 114 yards and a passing touchdown. In Holcomb's second season he played in four games and started two games in which he threw eight touchdowns and four interceptions with 790 passing yards and a strong play-off performance in a loss to the Steelers where he threw for 429 yards and three touchdowns.http://football.about.com/library/weekly/aa010503.htm In 2003, his third season, he had more playing time playing ten games and starting eight of them. He replaced Tim Couch as starting quarterback during that season. In that season he threw ten touchdowns and twelve interceptions. In his final season as a Brown Jeff Garcia replaced him as starting quarterback. Holcomb only played in four games and started two of them in which he threw seven touchdowns and five interceptions with 737 yards passing. =Buffalo Bills= Holcomb went to the Buffalo Bills before the 2005 season. He started half of the games in his first season as a Bill while J. P. Losman started the other half. Holcomb threw ten touchdowns and eight interceptions with 1,509 passing yards that season. In Holcomb's second and final season as a Bill he didn't play a regular season game the whole season. =Philadelphia Eagles= He was traded on March 26, 2007 to the Philadelphia Eagles with Takeo Spikes for Darwin Walker and a conditional 2008 draft pick, which the Bills would use to select Stevie Johnson. However, Holcomb never played a regular season game as an Eagle and was quickly traded. =Minnesota Vikings= On August 27, 2007, the Philadelphia Eagles traded Holcomb to the Minnesota Vikings for a sixth round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. Holcomb played and started three games that season throwing two touchdowns and an interception with 515 passing yards. After the 2007 season, the Vikings then went on to release him on February 27, 2008. =Retirement= On July 7, 2008, it was announced that Holcomb would retire from the NFL. =Memorable moments= A Wild Card game against Pittsburgh in January 2003 saw Holcomb, playing for the Browns, become the third quarterback in playoff history to throw for more than 400 yards. He finished the game with 429 yards, a new postseason record for a regulation game. Broadcasting career/post-playing career In 2008, Holcomb joined his alma mater Middle Tennessee as the color commentator for the Blue Raider Radio Network. In addition, Holcomb has broadcast the TSSAA Blue Cross Bowl and was a broadcast member of the Music City Bowl Preview. In February 2015, it was announced that Holcomb would be joining the coaching staff at Riverdale (Tenn.) HS, where he would be handling offensive coordinator duties.

After 14 years in the U.S. House, he was defeated for reelection by Democrat Kathy Dahlkemper on November 4, 2008. Early life and career English is a lifelong resident of Erie and is of Irish and German descent. He attended Portsmouth Abbey School in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. While in college, he served as Chairman of the PA Federation of College Republicans. English served as Erie City Controller from 1985 to 1989. In 1988 he was the Republican nominee for State Treasurer but was defeated by Democrat Catherine Baker Knoll. He stayed in politics and served as Chief of Staff for then State Senator Melissa Hart. U.S. House of Representatives English was elected to the House of Representatives in 1994 after seven-term incumbent Tom Ridge vacated the seat to make a successful run for governor. English benefited from the Republican wave of 1994 as well as Ridge's coattails. In addition, the Democrats had a crowded primary in which the Erie candidates split the vote, which allowed Sharon attorney Bill Leavens to win the primary. English, as a native of Erie, then garnered enough support from his hometown (generally a Democratic stronghold) to win the election.DCCC.org: Erie Times News ‚Äì Foust makes strong foe for English English was re-elected in a close race in 1996 against Erie attorney and Marine Corps veteran Ron DiNicola as Bill Clinton carried the district. However, he was handily reelected in 1998 on Ridge's coattails, and didn't face a close race again until 2006. That year, he defeated Steve Porter by only 54% to 42% (with 4% going to Constitution Party candidate Tim Hagberg). Porter was an unknown retired college professor who spent virtually no money; he raised only $81,100 to English's $1.4 million.Database of 2006 Pennsylvania congressional spending from OpenSecrets English was liberal on economic matters and conservative on social matters. He has strong ties to organized labor, which is not typical for most Republicans. However, this served him well in a district that was dominated by the heavily Democratic and thoroughly unionized city of Erie (no other city in the district has more than 17,000 people). English moved up the seniority ladder in the House over the years. From his first term, he was a member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee‚Äîthe first freshman Republican to be appointed to this committee since 1975. In the 110th Congress, English served as the ranking member on the Subcommittee of Select Revenue Measures. 2008 Election English's narrow win in 2006 led the Democrats to target his seat in 2008. He faced first-time candidate and small businesswoman Kathy Dahlkemper in the November election. The race captured considerable national attention. Although English outspent Dahlkemper‚Äîraising $2.2 million to Dahlkemper's $872,000‚Äîthe Democratic House Campaign Committee overwhelmed English overall in spending on media buys and direct mail. In the election, English was defeated, taking 48 percent of the vote to Dahlkemper's 52 percent. English carried five of the district's seven counties, but could not overcome a 14-point deficit in his native Erie County, the largest county in the district.

Register-transfer-level abstraction is used in hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL to create high- level representations of a circuit, from which lower-level representations and ultimately actual wiring can be derived. Design at the RTL level is typical practice in modern digital design. Unlike in software compiler design when register-transfer level intermediate representation is the lowest level, RTL level is the usual input that circuit designers operate on and there are many more levels than it. In fact, in circuit synthesis, an intermediate language between the input register transfer level representation and the target netlist is sometimes used. Unlike in netlist, constructs such as cells, functions, and multi-bit registers are available.Yosys Manual (RTLIL) Examples include FIRRTL and RTLIL. RTL description rightthumb300px Example of a simple circuit with the output toggling at each rising edge of the input. The inverter forms the combinational logic in this circuit, and the register holds the state. A synchronous circuit consists of two kinds of elements: registers (Sequential logic) and combinational logic. Registers (usually implemented as D flip-flops) synchronize the circuit's operation to the edges of the clock signal, and are the only elements in the circuit that have memory properties. Combinational logic performs all the logical functions in the circuit and it typically consists of logic gates. For example, a very simple synchronous circuit is shown in the figure. The inverter is connected from the output, Q, of a register to the register's input, D, to create a circuit that changes its state on each rising edge of the clock, clk. In this circuit, the combinational logic consists of the inverter. When designing digital integrated circuits with a hardware description language (HDL), the designs are usually engineered at a higher level of abstraction than transistor level (logic families) or logic gate level. In HDLs the designer declares the registers (which roughly correspond to variables in computer programming languages), and describes the combinational logic by using constructs that are familiar from programming languages such as if-then-else and arithmetic operations. This level is called register-transfer level. The term refers to the fact that RTL focuses on describing the flow of signals between registers. As an example, the circuit mentioned above can be described in VHDL as follows: D <= not Q; process(clk) begin if rising_edge(clk) then Q <= D; end if; end process; Using an EDA tool for synthesis, this description can usually be directly translated to an equivalent hardware implementation file for an ASIC or an FPGA. The synthesis tool also performs logic optimization. At the register-transfer level, some types of circuits can be recognized. If there is a cyclic path of logic from a register's output to its input (or from a set of registers outputs to its inputs), the circuit is called a state machine or can be said to be sequential logic. If there are logic paths from a register to another without a cycle, it is called a pipeline. RTL in the circuit design cycle RTL is used in the logic design phase of the integrated circuit design cycle. An RTL description is usually converted to a gate-level description of the circuit by a logic synthesis tool. The synthesis results are then used by placement and routing tools to create a physical layout. Logic simulation tools may use a design's RTL description to verify its correctness. Power estimation techniques for RTL The most accurate power analysis tools are available for the circuit level but unfortunately, even with switch- rather than device-level modelling, tools at the circuit level have disadvantages like they are either too slow or require too much memory thus inhibiting large chip handling. The majority of these are simulators like SPICE and have been used by the designers for many years as performance analysis tools. Due to these disadvantages, gate-level power estimation tools have begun to gain some acceptance where faster, probabilistic techniques have begun to gain a foothold. But it also has its trade off as speedup is achieved on the cost of accuracy, especially in the presence of correlated signals. Over the years it has been realized that biggest wins in low power design cannot come from circuit- and gate-level optimizations whereas architecture, system, and algorithm optimizations tend to have the largest impact on power consumption. Therefore, there has been a shift in the incline of the tool developers towards high-level analysis and optimization tools for power. = Motivation = It is well known that more significant power reductions are possible if optimizations are made on levels of abstraction, like the architectural and algorithmic level, which are higher than the circuit or gate level \\"Power Estimation Techniques for Integrated Circuits \\" This provides the required motivation for the developers to focus on the development of new architectural level power analysis tools. This in no way implies that lower level tools are unimportant. Instead, each layer of tools provides a foundation upon which the next level can be built. The abstractions of the estimation techniques at a lower level can be used on a higher level with slight modifications. = Advantages of doing power estimation at RTL or architectural level = * Designers use a Register-Transfer Level(RTL) description of the design to make optimizations and trade-offs very early in the design flow. *The presence of functional blocks in an RTL description makes the complexity of architectural design much more manageable even for large chips because RTL has granularity sufficiently larger than gate- or circuit-level descriptions. =Gate Equivalents\\"Low-Power Architectural Design Methodologies \\"= It is a technique based on the concept of gate equivalents. The complexity of a chip architecture can be described approximately in terms of gate equivalents where gate equivalent count specifies the average number of reference gates that are required to implement the particular function. The total power required for the particular function is estimated by multiplying the approximated number of gate equivalents with the average power consumed per gate. The reference gate can be any gate e.g. 2-input NAND gate.  Examples of Gate Equivalent technique  * Class-Independent Power Modeling: It is a technique which tries to estimate chip area, speed, and power dissipation based on information about the complexity of the design in terms of gate equivalents. The functionality is divided among different blocks but no distinction is made about the functionality of the blocks i.e. it is basically class independent. This is the technique used by the Chip Estimation System (CES). ::Steps: ::# Identify the functional blocks such as counters, decoders, multipliers, memories, etc. ::# Assign a complexity in terms of Gate Equivalents. The number of GE‚Äôs for each unit type are either taken directly as an input from the user or are fed from a library. :\\\\displaystyle P = \\\\sum_{i \\\\in \\\\text{fns}} \\\\textit{GE}_i (E_\\\\text{typ} + C_L^i V_\\\\text{dd}^2) f A_\\\\text{int}^i ::Where Etyp is the assumed average dissipated energy by a gate equivalent, when active. The activity factor, Aint, denotes the average percentage of gates switching per clock cycle and is allowed to vary from function to function. The capacitive load, CL, is a combination of fan-out loading as well as wiring. An estimate of the average wire length can be used to calculate the wiring capacitance. This is provided by the user and cross-checked by using a derivative of Rent‚Äôs Rule. ::Assumptions: ::# A single reference gate is taken as the basis for all the power estimates not taking into consideration different circuit styles, clocking strategies, or layout techniques. ::# The percentage of gates switching per clock cycle denoted by Activity factors are assumed to be fixed regardless of the input patterns. ::# Typical gate switching energy is characterized by completely random uniform white noise (UWN) distribution of the input data. This implies that the power estimation is same regardless of the circuit being idle or at maximum load as this UWN model ignores how different input distributions affect the power consumption of gates and modules.\\"Register-Transfer Level Estimation Techniques for Switching Activity and Power Consumption\\" * Class-Dependent Power Modeling: This approach is slightly better than the previous approach as it takes into account customized estimation techniques to the different types of functional blocks thus trying to increase the modelling accuracy which wasn‚Äôt the case in the previous technique such as logic, memory, interconnect, and clock hence the name. The power estimation is done in a very similar manner to the independent case. The basic switching energy is based on a three-input AND gate and is calculated from technology parameters e.g. gate width, tox, and metal width provided by the user. :P_\\\\text{bitlines} = \\\\dfrac{N_\\\\text{col}}{2} \\\\cdot (L_\\\\text{col} C_\\\\text{wire} + N_\\\\text{row} C_\\\\text{cell}) V_\\\\text{dd} V_\\\\text{swing} ::Where Cwire denotes the bit line wiring capacitance per unit length and Ccell denotes the loading due to a single cell hanging off the bit line. The clock capacitance is based on the assumption of an H-tree distribution network. Activity is modelled using a UWN model. As can be seen by the equation the power consumption of each components is related to the number of columns (Ncol) and rows (Nrow) in the memory array. ::Disadvantages: ::# The circuit activities are not modeled accurately as an overall activity factor is assumed for the entire chip which is also not trustable as provided by the user. As a matter of fact activity factors will vary throughout the chip hence this is not very accurate and prone to error. This leads to the problem that even if the model gives a correct estimate for the total power consumption by the chip, the module wise power distribution is fairly inaccurate. ::#The chosen activity factor gives the correct total power, but the breakdown of power into logic, clock, memory, etc. is less accurate. Therefore this tool is not much different or improved in comparison with CES. =Precharacterized Cell Libraries= This technique further customizes the power estimation of various functional blocks by having separate power model for logic, memory, and interconnect suggesting a Power Factor Approximation (PFA) method for individually characterizing an entire library of functional blocks such as multipliers, adders, etc. instead of a single gate-equivalent model for ‚Äúlogic‚Äù blocks. The power over the entire chip is approximated by the expression: :\\\\displaystyle P = \\\\sum_{i \\\\in \\\\text{all blocks}} K_i G_i f_i Where Ki is PFA proportionality constant that characterizes the ith functional element,Gi is the measure of hardware complexity, and fi denotes the activation frequency.  Example  Gi denoting the hardware complexity of the multiplier is related to the square of the input word length i.e. N2 where N is the word length. The activation frequency is the rate at which multiplies are performed by the algorithm denoted by fmult and the PFA constant, Kmult, is extracted empirically from past multiplier designs and shown to be about 15 fW/bit2-Hz for a 1.2 ¬µm technology at 5V. The resulting power model for the multiplier on the basis of the above assumptions is: \\\\displaystyle P_\\\\text{mult} = K_\\\\text{mult} N^2 f_\\\\text{mult} Advantages: * Customization is possible in terms of whatever complexity parameters which are appropriate for that block. E.g. for a multiplier the square of the word length was appropriate. For memory, the storage capacity in bits is used and for the I/O drivers the word length alone is adequate. Weakness: * There is the implicit assumption that the inputs do not affect the multiplier activity which is contradictory to the fact that the PFA constant Kmult is intended to capture the intrinsic internal activity associated with the multiply operation as it is taken to be a constant. The estimation error (relative to switch-level simulation) for a 16x16 multiplier is experimented and it is observed that when the dynamic range of the inputs doesn‚Äôt fully occupy the word length of the multiplier, the UWN model becomes extremely inaccurate.\\"Power Macromodeling for High Level Power Estimationy\\" Granted, good designers attempt to maximize word length utilization. Still, errors in the range of 50-100% are not uncommon. The figure clearly suggests a flaw in the UWN model.

Fossella, a Staten Island native, was born to a family that included several politicians. Fossella initially took office in 1997, after winning a special election held to replace the resigning Susan Molinari. After a DUI arrest in Alexandria, Virginia on May 1, 2008, it was discovered that he was living with Laura Fay, a retired US Air Force lieutenant colonel, while Fossella was married. The two had a child together and were living in Virginia as a married couple while he was living in Staten Island with his wife.http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/05/staten_islands_fossella_admits.html Staten Island's Fossella admits child from affair, May 08, 2008 He announced on his official website on May 20 that he had chosen to serve out the remainder of his term, which ended on January 3, 2009, but decided not to run for re-election.Staten Island's Fossella will not seek re-election, 2008-05-19, retrieved 2008-05-20.Barrett, Devlin, NY Congressman Fossella says he won't seek re-election, 2008-05-20, retrieved 2005-05-20.  Early life, education and family  Fossella was born on Staten Island into a Roman Catholic family of Irish and Italian descent. Fossella's great-grandfather James A. O'Leary represented Staten Island in Congress from 1935 to 1944. One of his uncles, Frank Fossella, was a prominent Staten Island Democrat who was a City Council member in 1985.Diane C. Lore, \\"Frank Fossella, 88, political mentor, teacher and family patriarch\\", Staten Island Advance, August 19, 2014. His father, Vito John Fossella Sr., served in various appointed positions in the city administrations of Democratic Mayors Edward I. Koch and Abraham D. Beame, then became a successful construction engineer.Jonathan P. Hicks, \\"Man in The News ‚Äî Vito John Fossella Jr.; City Hall To Capitol\\", New York Times, November 6, 1997. Fossella, the fourth of seven children, was a basketball player at Monsignor Farrell High School, where he got his first political experience in the student council. He briefly played violin and percussion with the Christian pop band Sonseed. He attended Iona College in New Rochelle, then transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in economics in 1987. At Penn, he was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. After college, Fossella worked as a management consultant at the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu was the second largest campaign contributor to Fossella in the 2006 campaign cycleVito Fossella: Campaign Finance/Money - Top Donors - Congressman 2006.

Fossella then attended law school. He received a Juris Doctor from the Fordham University School of Law in 1993, and worked as an associate at a medical malpractice defense law firm Schiavetti Begos & Nicholson. In 1990, Fossella married Mary Patricia Rowan. They have three children and live in the Great Kills neighborhood on Staten Island. Fossella also had a daughter out-of- wedlock in 2005 with retired Lt. Col. Laura Fay.  New York City Council  = Early political work; election = Fossella was a political prot√©g√© of Michael J. Petrides, a member of the city's School Board and a Staten Island political strategist. In 1990, Fossella changed his voter registration from the Democratic Party to become the family's first Republican. \\"I found myself voting more and more for Republicans,\\" he said in 1997. \\"For the most part, my family reacted well. But still, I would love to have been a fly on the wall.\\" Under Petrides' guidance, he joined the 1992 re-election campaign of Staten Island Congresswoman Susan Molinari and, in 1993, the mayoral campaign of Rudy Giuliani. Fossella's political career began in April 1994, when he won a special election to the New York City Council, representing Staten Island's South Shore and Mid-Island section. He replaced Councilman Alfred C. Cerullo III, who had left to become Commissioner of Consumer Affairs in the Rudy Giuliani administration. Fossella spent $92,000 in the election, in which he had five opponents.Jonathan P. Hicks, \\"Question Haunts a Candidate: 'Didn't You Just Run?'\\", New York Times, November 8, 1994. In November 1994, Fossella was reelected to the remaining three years of Cerullo's term, defeating Democrat Rosemarie Mangano. He served on the Council until November 1997. = Council initiatives = Fossella's council initiatives included: * Authoring the legislation that led to the agreement to permanently close the Fresh Kills Landfill * Conceiving the idea of the South Richmond Rezoning Study, a comprehensive rezoning initiative on Staten Island * Securing funding for the construction of P.S. 56 and P.S. 6, the first new schools to be built on Staten Island in over a decade. United States Congress  Fossella in Lower Manhattan on September 12, 2001. = Initial election = In June 1997, Fossella was selected by executive committee of the Staten Island Republican Party as its candidate to run for the Congressional seat being vacated by Representative Susan Molinari.Jonathan P. Hicks, \\"Republican Is Chosen To Seek Molinari Seat\\", The New York Times, June 3, 1997. Fossella won the special election in November 1997, defeating Democratic Assemblyman Eric Vitaliano with 61 percent of the vote. Vito Fossella, Nancy Reagan, and Rudy Giuliani in 2002. = Re-elections = In November 1998, Fossella won a full term with 68 percent of the vote. He was re-elected in 2000, winning 65 percent of the vote against Democrat Katina M. Johnstone even as Al Gore carried the district. In 2002, he was re-elected with 70 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Arne M. Mattsson. Fossella with President George W. Bush and Peter King in 2004. In 2004, Fossella faced his first close contest against former state assemblyman and judge Frank J. Barbaro. Barbaro actually won the Brooklyn portion of the district by seven points, the first time Fossella had not won that area; Barbaro had represented much of this area in Albany for 23 years. However, Barbaro performed poorly on Staten Island, and Fossella won there by 26 points‚Äîenough for him to win a fourth full term with 59% of the vote districtwide. Some have speculated that he was helped by George W. Bush's 13-point win on Staten Island. Fossella was considered a possible challenger to Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the 2005 election, but he chose not to make the race. In 2006, incumbent Fossella defeated Democrat Steve Harrison, a relatively unknown Brooklyn attorney, by a margin of 56.7%-43.3%. = 2008 election = Before Fossella announced that he would not run in 2008, he was included in the National Republican Congressional Committee's list of Republican candidates who qualified for fundraising help because they were thought to be particularly vulnerable. Steve Harrison hoped to run against Fossella again in the 2008 election, but New York City Council member Domenic Recchia also began seeking the Democratic nomination. For several days after his DWI arrest and his admission of an adulterous affair and fathering an out- of-wedlock child, Fossella gave indications that he might run for re-election despite these problems. On May 20, however, he dropped out of the race. On May 28, the Staten Island Democratic Party endorsed City Councilman Michael E. McMahon for the Democratic nomination, although Harrison said he would remain a candidate in the Democratic primary. On the Republican side, several prominent elected officials considered running but decided against it. On May 29, the Staten Island Republican Party endorsed Frank Powers, a member of the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority who had never held elective office but who promised to spend $500,000 of his own money on the race. However, Powers died on June 22. Powers's son (Frank M. Powers) was also in the race, running as a Libertarian;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91252472 Powers vs. Powers in New York, NPR 6-6-08 however, the Libertarian Party did not endorse him. Robert Straniere was on the ballot for the Republican Party, and Susan Overeem was the Libertarian Party candidate. McMahon won the election on November 4, 2008, and replaced Fossella in Congress on January 3, 2009. = Committee assignments = * Committee on Energy and Commerce  Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection  Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Materials  Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet = Political positions = Fossella's voting record was very conservative by New York standards. In contrast, most Republicans from New York City (such as Rudy Giuliani, Michael Bloomberg, and Fossella's two predecessors, Guy and Susan Molinari) tend to be fairly moderate. Although Democrats have a 17-point advantage in registered voters, the Democrats in this district tend to be fairly conservative on social issues. Fossella had a lifetime rating of 83 from the American Conservative Union. In ratings measuring 17 key legislative votes of the 2005-2006 term of the 109th Congress, issued by Public Citizen, he was the only congressional representative from NY (Senate or House), out of 31 total and 9 Republicans, to score a perfect 0.http://www.citizen.org/documents/ACFFDF1.pdf Public Citizen Vote Chart ‚Äì 109th Congress However, after years of getting ratings in the 90s from the ACU, some of Fossella's voting record shifted more toward the center. He got a 75 in 2006, a 70 in 2007 and a 74 in 2008. In August 2002, appearing on CNN's Crossfire, Fossella argued for partly privatizing Social Security and allow some of the funds be placed on Wall Street investments. He said \\"I happen to think the President is on the right side of history here. And I think the more you empower American people, the more you give them the opportunity to invest on their own and being in control of their own destiny and their own retirement, the better off we'll be.\\" In a standardized constituent letter in February 2005, Fossella said \\"We need to examine the viability of voluntary personal savings accounts in which young people would have the opportunity to invest a small portion of their savings.\\"\\"Dear Friend\\" letter from Fossella's Congressional office, February 18, 2005, discussing his position on the Social Security system In June 2003, Fossella wrote an op-ed for the Washington Times, in which he said \\"The claims that progress is too slow, the situation unstable and the United States lacks the expertise to get the job done does not reflect reality on the ground in Baghdad, Kirkuk and beyond. Indeed, the critics who complain that the seeds of democracy will not take root in the sands of a desert where tyranny ruled are as wrong today as the pessimists were in 1945.\\" The final sentence of the column was \\"The United States will fulfill its commitment to Iraq, and then we will depart, having liberated a nation, freed a people and established a democracy of the people, by the people and for the people.\\"\\"Progress in Iraq\\" , opinion column by Fossella, Washington Times, June 4, 2003.

Fossella voted for the Marriage Protection Act in 2004, and for the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004 and 2006, all of which would nationally define marriage as between a man and a woman. In 2007, Fossella voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill nationally prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. In 2005, Fossella spoke out against the Bush Administration's handling of appropriating Homeland Security funds.Press Release, , July 13, 2005. After the 2007 State of the Union Address, Fossella crossed the aisle to join with Senator Hillary Clinton in 2007 to raise awareness of health issues suffered those who at worked at the World Trade Center site on and after 9/11. Fossella is quoted as saying \\"We have made progress over the last year to begin getting the resources necessary to help our 9/11 heroes. However, we now need a significant investment by the federal government into health monitoring and treatment for those who are sick or injured. In addition, the federal government must develop a comprehensive plan to address the health impacts of 9/11. We continue urging the White House to provide adequate funding in the 2008 budget to help all those who are sick or injured as a result of the terror attacks.\\"Press Release, Senator Clinton = Legislative initiatives = Fossella's legislative initiatives while in Congress included the following: * Return over $700 million to individual investors by eliminating fees by the SEC with the Investor and Capital Markets Fee Relief Act.

Combined with the adjacent Nymphenburg Palace Park it constitutes one of the premier royal palaces of Europe. Its frontal width of (north-south axis) even surpasses Versailles Palace. The Nymphenburg served as the main summer residence for the former rulers of Bavaria of the House of Wittelsbach. History =Building History= Nymphenburg Palace, around 1760, as painted by Bernardo Bellotto. The palace was commissioned by the electoral couple Ferdinand Maria and Henriette Adelaide of Savoy to the designs of the Italian architect Agostino Barelli in 1664 after the birth of their son Maximilian II Emanuel. The central pavilion was completed in 1675. As a building material, it utilised limestone from Kelheim. The palace was gradually expanded and transformed over the years. It then quickly replaced the nearby Blutenburg Castle as major hunting lodge of the court. Starting in 1701, Maximilian Emanuel, the heir to Bavaria, a sovereign electorate of the Holy Roman Empire, undertook a systematic extension of the palace. Two pavilions were added each in the south and north of Barelli's palace by Enrico Zucalli and Giovanni Antonio Viscardi and were connected with the centre pavilion by two gallery wings. In 1716, Joseph Effner redesigned the facade of the centre pavilion in French Baroque style with pilasters. Later, the south section of the palace was further extended to build the court stables (1719). For the sake of balance, the orangery building was added to the north which was only completed in 1758. Finally, Nymphenburg Palace was completed with a grand circle (the Schlossrondell) of Baroque mansions (the so-called Kavaliersh√§uschen ‚Äì cavalier's lodges) erected under Maximilian Emanuel's son Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII Albert. Birthroom of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. In 1795, Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria ordered the widening of the galleries on the park side. In 1826, under King Ludwig I of Bavaria, his architect Leo von Klenze removed the gables of the main pavilion with the Electoral coat of arms and created an attic style decoration directly under the roof instead. Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria with his son Ludwig, his grandson Rupprecht and his great-grandson Luitpold in the park of Nymphenburg Palace, about 1910 =Residence= With the Treaty of Nymphenburg signed in July 1741, Charles Albert allied with France and Spain against Austria. Two of his children were born here: Maria Antonia (future Electress of Saxony) in 1724 and Maria Anna Josepha (future Margravine of Baden-Baden) in 1734. Charles Albert lived during his time in Munich as Holy Roman Emperor at Nymphenburg Palace and died there in 1745. In 1747, Elector Max III. Joseph founded the Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory. In 1792, Elector Charles Theodor opened the park for the public. For a long time, the palace was the favourite summer residence of the rulers of Bavaria. King Max I Joseph died there in 1825 and his great- grandson King Ludwig II was born there in 1845. In 1863, the only meeting between Ludwig and Otto von Bismarck was held in Nymphenburg, although they remained connected in a lifelong friendship. Today, Nymphenburg is open to the public but also continues to be a home and chancery for the head of the House of Wittelsbach, currently Franz, Duke of Bavaria. Palace The palace, together with its park, is now one of the most famous sights of Munich. The baroque facades comprise an overall width of about 700 metres. Some rooms still show their original baroque decoration while others were later redesigned in rococo or neoclassical style. Nymphenburg, ca 1730. Aerial photograph Nymphenburg palace and exterior =Central pavilion= The Steinerner Saal (Stone Hall) in the central pavilion, with ceiling frescoes by Johann Baptist Zimmermann and F. Zimmermann and decorations by Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s, is an impressive sight. Acting as a grand hall, it occupies over three floors of the central pavilion of the palace. The central ceiling fresco is Helios in his chariot, accompanied by other gods. Steinerner Saal (Marble Hall) North of the Stone Hall, there is the wood-panelled antechamber, the audience chamber decorated with Brussels tapestries and the former bedroom with the so-called Little Beauty Gallery with the ladies of Versailles, all rooms were remodelled under Maximilian II Emanuel in the style of the R√©gence but retain their original Baroque ceilings. Here are on display portraits of the elector and his wife Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska. The bedroom closes the park side, next to it is the Drechsel Cabinet (turnery cabinet) of Maximilian III Joseph, designed by Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s. Three rooms further to the north were created under Charles Theodore with the widening of the gallery wing. In the first room there are now more portraits of ladies from the Great Gallery of Beauties of Max Emanuel, the second one is decorated with a pile rug with the coats of arms of Bavaria and the Palatinate (known as \\"coat of arms room\\"), while the third room contains portraits of Charles Theodore and both his consorts Elisabeth Auguste and Maria Leopoldine. The Chinese Cabinet with chinoiserie, one of the rooms of Nymphenburg Palace South of the Stone Hall are inversely to the northern rooms of the main building, the hall with the portrait of Charles Albert, the audience room with the portrait of the founding couple Ferdinand Maria and his consort Henriette Adelaide and the Former Bedroom with portraits of Max Emanuel and his consort Theresa Kunegunda. Here too, the original Baroque ceilings have survived. The walls of the so-called lacquer cabinet that adjoins the bedroom are almost completely covered with Chinese panels showing scenes from a Chinese novel. The stucco was done by Franz Xaver Feuchtmayer the Younger. Behind the south gallery are the Writing Cabinet and Antechamber of Elector Charles Theodore, which were created with the widening of the gallery wings. In both the North and South Galleries next to the Central Pavilion are vedutes of Bavarian castles. These galleries connect the central pavilion with the southern and northern pavilions. =Southern pavilions and wings= The Inner southern Pavilion housed the apartments of the Electress during the period of its origin. The former small dining room of the Inner Southern Pavilion today houses the famous attraction Gallery of Beauties of King Ludwig I of Bavaria. On behalf of the king the court painter Joseph Karl Stieler has portrayed 36 beautiful women from all social classes of Munich, the best known of these are the shoemaker's daughter Helene Sedlmayr and Ludwig's infamous mistress Lola Montez. In the nearby Queen's bedroom one can see where King Ludwig II of Bavaria was born on 25 August 1845. Its mahogany furniture was made in 1815 in Munich, unlike the mahogany furniture for Queen Caroline‚Äôs audience room which was made in Paris, as was the furniture in the Queen's Study. The Outer Southern Pavilion is generally inaccessible. It served as a kitchen building at Max Emanuel's time and was then reconstructed like the inner pavilion in neo-classical times. Further south, the third pavilion was built as a comedihaus and then served from 1750 as a new kitchen house. The southern corridor built in 1747 connects this building with the stables in the south wing. In the former royal stables in the South Wing is the Carriage Museum (Marstallmuseum), with one of the greatest coach collections in Europe. They also played a part in historical events - the Paris Coronation Coach for example was used for the coronation of Emperor Charles VII in 1742. Among the main attractions of the museum are the magnificent carriages and sleighs of King Ludwig II. The first floor of the former court stables houses a collection of Nymphenburg porcelain, the factory which, also located in the palace complex, was founded by Maximilian III Joseph. Its handcrafted products are of legendary kind and quality, nowadays said to be comparable only to Augarten and S√®vres. The Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory itself is located in one of the houses of the northern roundabouts and can be visited only by written appointment. In the adjoining Outer South Wing of the castle is a restaurant with beer garden. =Northern pavilions and wings= The Inner Northern Pavilion is generally inaccessible, here was Max Emanuel's \\"appartement de parade\\". The Outer Northern Pavilion houses the chapel, whose ceiling painting deals with the life of St. Mary Magdalene. It was already begun in 1702 by Antonio Viscardi from the design by Enrico Zuccalli. Further north is the third pavilion, the Gardemeublebau from 1723, which served for the Cue sports and the Jeu de Passe during the period of its origin. It is connected to the north wing by the northern corridor of 1739. Since 1990, the Museum of Man and Nature has been housed in the North Wing. The Hubertus Hall upstairs served for concerts. Today the Hubertus Hall, the Orangery Hall, and the Johannis Hall in the North Wing as well as the Iron House in the park can be booked for parties, concerts, conferences and other functions. From 1835 the Mary Ward Elementary School was in the adjoining Outer North Wing of the castle. Founded by Mary Ward, it paved the way for a better education for girls. Mary Ward came after travelling from Rome to Munich in 1627 and was sponsored by Elector Maximilian I. King Ludwig I finally invited the girls' school to the Nymphenburg Palace in 1835. Park =Garden structure= The park, once an Italian garden (1671), which was enlarged and rearranged in French style by Dominique Girard, a pupil of Le Notre, was finally redone in the English manner during the early 19th century by Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, on behalf of prince-elector Charles Theodore. Von Sckell was also the creator of the English Garden in Munich. He preserved the main elements of the Baroque garden (such as the \\"Grand Parterre\\"). The park is bisected by the long western canal along the principal axis which leads from the palace to the marble cascade (decorated with stone figures of Greek and Roman gods) in the west. The iron greenhouse north of the Grand Parterre was completed in 1807, the adjacent geranium house in 1816.

As part of the transformation of the entire castle grounds by Sckell it was simplified, but retained its original size. The \\"Grand Cascade\\" was built by Joseph Effner in 1717. He was referring to a concept of Fran√ßois Ro√´ttiers. The water falls in the middle of a two- part water staircase, the first stage being half round to the west, the second, deeper, is formed to the east. The cascade consists of symmetry which continues through the centre channel. The right side of the cataract was covered with pink marble in 1770. Originally a supporting architecture was to be provided, which was never executed. Instead, from 1775 to 1785, sculptures were added. Many were the work of Dominik Auliczek and Roman Anton Boos, who later added twelve decorative marble vases with mythological themes. The Grand Cascade. Statue of Isar on the right, of the Danube on the left The fountains in front of the palace and in the garden parterre continue to be operated by the water powered Pumping Stations built between 1803 and 1808. The Northern Cabinet Garden is small garden that borders directly the garden side of the north wing of the main palace. It is also called Kaisergarten, because it is in the immediate vicinity of the rooms where Charles Albert lived during his time in Munich as Emperor Charles VII. It has its counterpart in the Southern Cabinet Garden where Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s built an octagonal bird house in 1757. Two lakes are situated on both sides of the canal. The \\"D√∂rfchen\\" was created under Maximilian III Joseph as Petit hameau. The \\"Salettl\\" (1799), a cottage with its little garden nearby close to the former menagerie served as attraction for the children of Maximilian IV Joseph. The garden wall (1730‚Äì1735) preserves several Ha-ha effects. A passage close to the old arboretum in the north of the Grand Parterre leads to the large Botanical Garden of Munich. Originally there was also a visual axis, the Durchblick, to the north-west-located Blutenburg Castle. The canals of Nymphenburg are part of the northern Munich channel system, a system of waterways that connected also to the complex of Schleissheim Palace. The endpoint of the eastern canal leading from the city to the palace forms the Cour d'honneur, the centre was designed by Effner as a water parterre with a fountain, cascade and branching canals on both sides. The driveway (\\"Auffahrtsallee\\") from the city on both sides of the eastern canal is framed by a semicircle of smaller baroque buildings (\\"Kavalierh√§user\\") at the Cour d'honneur. The eastern endpoint of the canal is the Hubertusbrunnen (1903, a fountain building by Adolf von Hildebrand). =Garden pavilions= Badenburg, Royal bathing house Amalienburg, Royal hunting lodge Within the park, a number of pavilions - palaces en miniature - were built: * The Pagodenburg (1716‚Äì1719) ‚Äì an octagonal, two story pavilion with Delft tile decoration downstairs and Chinoiserie upstairs. It was built by Joseph Effner as \\"maison de plaisance\\" and tea house. * The Badenburg (1719‚Äì1721) ‚Äì a Baroque pavilion also by Joseph Effner. It served for the private bathing and contains several rooms including a grand banqueting hall with a festive ornament decor by Charles Dubut and a very large tiled bath with a pool. The dressing room is decorated with various Chinese printed wallpapers. In the Monkey Cabinet the Elector performed his toilette. It was the first major building in Europe for centuries that was exclusively for the purpose of enjoying a comfortable bathroom. * The Magdalenenklause ‚Äì a faux ruin for retreat and meditation, erected between 1725 and 1728. The building with its prayer room is considered as an early representative of the hermitage and the ruins of architecture in Germany; it was to serve Max Emanuel as a place of contemplation - a memento mori, whose completion the elector however did not longer witness. * The Amalienburg ‚Äì a Rococo hunting lodge constructed in 1734‚Äì1739 by Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s for Charles Albert and his wife, Maria Amalia of Austria, including a hall of mirrors (designed by Johann Baptist Zimmermann and Joachim Dietrich) and a kennel room for the hunting dogs. The building with its decoration is a definite masterpiece at the climax of European rococo. * The Apollotemple ‚Äì a neoclassical monopteros temple by Leo von Klenze, erected in 1862‚Äì1865. The architecture of the garden pavilions was influential for other architecture in Germany. So the Wittelsbach Falkenlust Palace was built in the style of the Amalienburg while the Pagodenburg served as prototype for the building of the same name in Rastatt. Tourism Marstallmuseum Nymphenburg The grand parterre The main building alone has more than 300,000 visitors per year. Nymphenburg Palace is running dead even with the Munich Residence and lies ahead of Schleissheim Palace, but clearly behind the castles of King Ludwig II, especially Neuschwanstein. Museums: * Schlossmuseum (Royal apartments: Central pavilion, North and South Galleries, Inner Southern Pavilion, Garden pavilions) * Marstallmuseum (Carriage Museum: South wing) * Porzellanmuseum M√ºnchen (Nymphenburg porcelain museum: South wing) * Museum of Man and Nature (North wing) * Erwin von Kreibig-Museum (South Schlossrondell) Schloss Nymphenburg is accessible by Munich public transport's tram number 17. This line passes through the city centre, including Stachus and the main train station. Miscellaneous Between 1936 and 1939 open air events called \\"Nacht der Amazonen\\" (Night of the Amazons) were performed. These shows in the park comprised 2000 players with international stars, bare-breasted girls and included also members of the SS Cavalry under Hermann Fegelein. The palace and its park were some of the main filming locations of Alain Resnais's 1961 movie Last Year at Marienbad. Also Ludwig, a 1972 film directed by Italian director Luchino Visconti about the life and death of King Ludwig II, was partly filmed in Nymphenburg. The Dressage Facility for the equestrian events of the 1972 Summer Olympics was created in the Nymphenburg park.1972 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 2. Part 2. pp. 206-7.

It is the third installation of the Tenchi Muyo! line of series, preceding Tenchi Muyo! GXP and succeeding Tenchi Universe. The show was localized in North America by Geneon Entertainment and aired on Cartoon Network from August 25 to September 29, 2000. The opening theme was sung by Linda Yamamoto. The ending theme was , sung by the cast, and Episode 24 had its own ending theme, sung by Mayumi Iizuka. Plot Tenchi in Tokyo begins when Tenchi Masaki relocates to Tokyo to apprentice at a Shinto shrine. He meets a new love interest, Sakuya Kumashiro, who is a classmate of his at his new school. Much of the series revolves around the development of Tenchi's and Sakuya's relationship and its effect on the girls back in Okayama. Unlike the preceding series in the franchise (Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki and Tenchi Universe), neither Tenchi nor his family has any connection to Jurai whatsoever in this series. In this continuity, the girls meet Tenchi on Earth because of one incident that takes place two years prior to the series. At that time, Ryoko and Washu stole a crystal from Jurai and fled towards Earth, pursued by Ayeka, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, and the Guardians in Ayeka's ship, and Mihoshi and Kiyone in a Galaxy Police ship. They are all injured when Ryoko consumes Ayeka's crystal and becomes a monster. Tenchi defeats the monster when a necklace he is wearing (a memento of his mother) turns into a sword. During the anniversary party for this event at Tenchi's home, it is revealed that each of the girls has a crystal from the necklace as a token of their bond with Tenchi, which they each took after Ryoko broke Tenchi's necklace apart. The main antagonist is Yugi, a mutant Juraian who was sealed away on Earth 3500 years ago when she almost destroyed Jurai. She intends to take over the Earth by turning it into her own kingdom, much as she tried with Jurai. In order for her plans to succeed, she must break the bonds that hold the Masaki family together. Because, in this continuity, the Masakis are defenders of Earth. They perform this function with the power in the crystals, but the crystals need to be in proximity to one another for them to be able to function. Yugi executes her plan partly through her henchmen, such as Hotsuma, who convinces Ryoko to leave Earth with him, but also by forming a genuine friendship with Sasami through one of her projections, also named Yugi. When Yugi's plan comes to fruition, it is revealed that Sakuya, too, is nothing more than another projection of Yugi, designed to scatter the Masaki Family. Yugi tries to get Tenchi to abandon reality and stay in a pocket universe with Sakuya, but Sakuya herself tells Tenchi to leave. When he does, the crystals summon the girls to him, and Tenchi is able to defeat Yugi. Yugi is then sealed away (at her own request) until she becomes a good person.

The game was ported to personal computers running Microsoft Windows 95/98; to the Dreamcast, as the enhanced remake Wetrix+; and to the Game Boy Color, as Wetrix or Wetrix GB. In 2000, Wetrix received a sequel on the PlayStation 2, entitled Aqua Aqua. Gameplay The player receives a flat square of land (the Landscape) and has the goal of gaining as many points as possible, through managing a landscape of Lakes and the water therein. This is accomplished by manoeuvering different types of Pieces that fall onto the playing area, one at a time (in a similar manner to the puzzle game Tetris). Each Piece has differing effects upon the arena. The main Pieces are Uppers, several different shapes that increase the height of the land on which they fall by one tier; these can be used to sculpt walls, dams, and the perimeters of Lakes. Shortly into the game, Water Bubbles will begin to fall; these burst upon impact with the land and flow realistically like a fluid across its surface. The main method of gathering points is by using the Fireball Piece to evaporate Lakes, the number of points depending upon the volume of water removed in this way. On the right side of the screen is a water gauge called the Drain, which fills up as water falls off the edge of the Landscape, or down holes created by Bombs. The player loses the game when the Drain fills up to the top. The only way to reduce the level of the Drain is by evaporating water with Fireballs; again, the amount it is reduced by depends upon the amount of water evaporated. Other modes of gameplay have different starting conditions or goals for the player to meet, but the basic features described above apply to all modes. The multiplayer section of the manual mysteriously states that \\"there is also a special technique for stealing energy from the opposing player's energy bar\\".http://www.gamesdatabase.org/Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_N64//Manual/formated/Wetrix_-_1998_-_Ocean_Software_Ltd..pdf Development Wetrix was the first game developed by brothers Ste and John Pickford's studio Zed Two. It started out as a demo of flowing water simulating technology for a game called Vampire Circus, which the Pickfords were developing at home as they tried to get Zed Two off the ground. The brothers enjoyed this water demo so much that they decided to turn it into a game in its own right. The original and first-released version of Wetrix was for the Nintendo 64 in 1998. Some sources have reported that the water tech demo was initially conceived to show this system's power by simulating water; however, whether or not the original tech demo was designed for the N64, or with it specifically in mind, has not been confirmed by the Pickford brothers themselves (see above). The next version of Wetrix released, in 1999, was for personal computers running Microsoft Windows 95/98. Although the main gameplay is the same as that of the original version, this version differs in that it lacks the after-game ranks and the lessons included as part of Practice mode (i.e. it has only the Practice game). Also, there are small differences in the graphics, most notably that the camera no longer zooms so closely on the board or follows the active piece so closely as the player moves it. The biggest difference is that the soundtrack was completely replaced, with the PC version receiving new music by different composers (namely the composers 2 dB). Some time after the release of this version of Wetrix, the Pickfords began to write a multiplayer mode supporting up to 7 players via local area network, which they hoped to release as a free patch for the original game. However, the code was never fully debugged and the Pickfords could not justify the expense of continuing to develop the patch without any income, and therefore it was never released. Messages relating to the network mode can be found in the \\"messages.txt\\" file used by the game. The Game Boy Color version was released in Japan in 1999 and Europe in 2000. It is scaled down in all ways, with downgraded graphics and different musical themes (albeit derived from those of the N64) designed specifically for its much lower powered hardware, and with gameplay that is significantly slower and does not fully match that of the console/PC versions (e.g. the points system uses much lower base scores, Lakes in which the player wants to create Rubber Ducks must have larger areas, etc.). The Sega Dreamcast version, Wetrix+ (sometimes referred to as Wetrix Plus), was released in 2000 as an enhanced remake of the original N64 version of Wetrix with upgraded graphics. Its gameplay modes, menu, etc. follow those of the N64 (albeit with enhanced graphics); however, it does inherit the PC version's remade soundtrack and relatively more static camera style (albeit with options for zoom level). Reception The Nintendo 64 version received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Next Generation said of the same console version: \\"It's unusual and fun, then it wears thin. There's nothing else like Wetrix on any other system, but that's just barely good enough.\\" References External links * 1998 video games Dreamcast games Falling block puzzle games Game Boy Color games Imagineer games Nintendo 64 games Ocean Software games Video games developed in the United Kingdom Windows games Cancelled PlayStation (console) games ","title":"Wetrix"},{"id":"963106","text":"A typical street in present-day Bussana Vecchia Bussana Vecchia is a former ghost town in Liguria, Italy. Abandoned due to an earthquake in 1887, it was renovated and repopulated by an international community of artists in the early 1960s. It is administratively a hamlet (frazione) of the city of Sanremo, near the border with France. To this day, it is home to a small group of local inhabitants as well as international artists, with craft shops, cafes, and restaurants, and has over the years gained the reputation of a rural artists' residence within the setting of a medieval village. Physical geography The town is located about 8 km northeast of Sanremo on a rocky hill behind Bussana Nuova. The land it occupies is relatively green, surrounded by Mediterranean scrub, chestnut groves, and maritime pines; however, the entire area has recently been used as an industrial zone, mainly for floriculture. History =Early history= Bussana was founded in Roman times, and originally named Armedina or Armedana; it was only in the 7th century, however, that the first evidence of stable settlements appeared. Following Lombard invasions, the local population decided to move to the underlying Valle Armea, where it remained until the 10th century, when frequent Saracen invasions forced them to move again to a higher and more easily defensible area. The construction of the first defensive structures on the hill began around this time. Beginning in the 11th century, Bussana fell under the control of the Counts of Ventimiglia , who provided for the construction of a first defensive castle. In the 13th century, the town was bought by the Republic of Genoa, though the approximately 250 inhabitants maintained a relative amount of autonomy. During this time, the original castle lost its defensive function and was converted to a residential structure. The annexed chapel continues to serve as a place of worship for the inhabitants of the village. Starting from the 15th century, a building boom began in the town, accompanied by a strong demographic increase; in 1404, the first church was completed, built on the remains of a previous one, and dedicated to Saint Giles. At the same time the houses, built according to the Roman style with square stones, began to be made using rounded stones from the nearby rocky beaches. The original abandoned castle is now in ruins. In the 16th century, the town expanded to the southeast, and it is to this period that almost all the buildings currently present in the village can be dated. The 17th century saw the complete renovation of the local church, which passed from the original Romanesque style to the Baroque. Life in the village continued relatively quietly, so much so that over the next two centuries, the settlement remained essentially unchanged. The population was predominantly rural, subsisting on agriculture, cultivation of olives and citrus fruits, and small-scale animal husbandry. Beginning in the 19th century, the first signs of the dangerousness of the place began to be felt, with an increasing understanding of the seismic risk of the area. The first notable earthquakes were recorded in 1831, 1851, and 1854, and this led the population to reinforce the existing structures with arches and columns. =Earthquake= A marble memorial in remembrance of those who died in the Earthquake in Bussana Vecchia The French Riviera and western Liguria are at the junction of the southwestern Alps and the Liguria basin, a region of moderate seismicity. The severest earthquake to hit Bussana struck the region on February 23, 1887, killing more than 2,000 people. The worst of the damage in Bussana occurred at 6:21 on that Ash Wednesday morning, as a seismic wave lasting 20 seconds caused immediate destruction and deaths throughout the village. The earthquake was the first recorded by a true seismograph built by Filippo Cecchi in Moncalieri, Italy. Most buildings in Bussana were severely damaged and the authorities decided to rebuild the village on a new site downhill called Bussana Nuova (\\"New Bussana\\"), which had until then been known as Capo Marine. The old village was abandoned and all of its buildings declared too dangerous for habitation. In 1889, the cornerstone of the town of Bussana Nuova was laid, and in 1894 the Bussanesi abandoned the original village, celebrating their last Mass on Palm Sunday. The original town, from that moment, would be known as Bussana Vecchia (\\"Old Bussana\\"). =Rebirth= In 1947, immigrants from southern Italy started illegally settling the ghost town. After a few forced evictions by the Italian police in the 1950s, the authorities ordered the destruction of all first-floor stairways and rooftops. Despite this, in the early 1960s, Vanni Giuffr√®, a sicilian painter, together with a group of artists, the Community of International Artists (now International Artists' Village), decided to move to what was by then commonly known as Bussana Vecchia. The spirit of the organization was somewhat idealistic: to be able to live simply and to work artistically within the village. The settlement had no electricity, tap water, or sanitation, but the new community of inhabitants grew from the small original nucleus to around 20-30 people by 1968, mostly hippie artists coming from all over Europe (Italy, Austria, England, France, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden). Tensions with the old inhabitants and with the police grew until on July 25, 1968, an eviction was ordered again and the police were sent to the village to enforce it. When the police forces arrived, they were faced with the villagers behind barricades refusing to leave and by a large group of international news reporters. The police decided to avoid confrontation. The first internal problems surrounding the legal recognition of properties in the village arose in the early 70s. Private property began to emerge as a necessity, in stark contrast to the initial ideals of the community of artists. In the meantime, the descendants of the original inhabitants of the town founded the \\"Amici di Bussana\\" (\\"Friends of Bussana\\") association, with the intention of regaining possession of the areas belonging to their ancestors, and they proceeded to enclose and declare the whole northern area of the town as their own. =Today= During the past sixty years, Bussana Vecchia has been partially rebuilt by its new inhabitants. The International Artists' Village was born, and despite periodic confrontations with the authorities (the latest eviction order was issued in 1997 when all buildings were declared property of the Italian Government), the community is still living there, selling its handiwork to tourists, and organizing artistic events. The artists and craftsmen, who live and work in Bussana Vecchia, have turned it into what it is today: an oasis of creativity, a unique and special place in the world. In 1974, the municipal aqueduct was connected to the town. In 1976, a meeting was held with all the villagers to discuss the future of the settlement, and it was decided to launch the \\"Committee of the Village of Bussana Vecchia\\". This committee was then officially recognized by the municipality of Sanremo, which thus also recognized the new toponymy of \\"Bussana Vecchia\\". In the same year, the first residences were legally recognized and in 1977, electricity was connected to the entire town. By the early 1980s, the resident population had risen to around a hundred people. However, the inhabitants were no longer exclusively artists: the economic- speculative boom of the time led many people to think that they could make easy profits with summer tourism, opening up more cheap craft shops, and thus lowering the quality level of the artistic productions. The development of the village now also involved the Municipality of Sanremo, which in 1982 announced an international competition to decide on the restructuring to be implemented at the site. In the meantime, the \\"New International Artists' Community\\" was officially recognized as a group which spoke for all the inhabitants of the village. In December 2017, the Italian Department of State Property (Demanio) sent tax settlements of tens of thousands of Euros to all the inhabitants and termed them \\"occupiers\\". Fear arose within the village that the \\"Bussanesi\\" might lose their homes, which they had rebuilt from ruins. That same month, the Bussanesi launched a petition to \\"Save Bussana Vecchia\\".Artists fight for Italian village, BBC News The Italian Department of State Property is planning to transfer full responsibility for Bussana Vecchia to the City of Sanremo starting in 2018. In March 2019, the M5S (Five Star Movement) political party threatened to begin evicting all residents of Bussana Vecchia unless the Municipality of Sanremo comes up with a plan for long-overdue repairs and maintenance by the end of April 2019, citing issues of safety for residents of the village, and in the interests of safeguarding the former ghost town for its unique tourist attractions. As of September 2019, the motion had been suspended and is up for review in January 2020. Attractions The village of Bussana Vecchia can be toured entirely on foot in about an hour. One of the major attractions for tourists are the characteristic shops and ateliers, which can be seen and visited almost everywhere in the village. The old church of Saint Giles, never restored, still shows traces of the original stuccos and paintings; it can only be visited from the outside, as it is structurally unsafe. The church belfry miraculously escaped the earthquake, and is seen by the inhabitants of Bussana Vecchia as the symbol of the town. The Oratory of John the Baptist, located in the eastern part of the town, can also be visited only from the outside. The town has been used for years by artists from all over the world, and this has influenced the type of events that take place there seasonally. Theatrical events, art exhibitions, and live music, especially on summer evenings, are among the most popular activities. Economy The original settlement of Bussana based its economy on the cultivation of olives and citrus fruits, and on fairly limited cereal cultivation. With the growth of interest in floriculture at the end of the 19th century, this possibility was beginning to be explored, and was then carried on by the inhabitants of Bussana Nuova. Currently, the economy is based entirely on tourism. The village offers bars, eateries, and restaurants offering vegetarian and Ligurian cuisine; additionally there is a bed & breakfast, a botanical garden, a nursery, and numerous workshops for artists and artisans who sell their products. Transportation By road: Bussana Vecchia can be reached by exiting the A10 \\"dei Fiori\\" motorway at the Sanremo Est/Arma di Taggia tollbooth, taking the Aurelia Bis to the Valle Armea exit, and following the road signs for Bussana/Bussana Vecchia. The village is accessible only by foot, so it is necessary to park outside the town, on the street. By train: The nearest train station is Taggia - Arma; a little further away is the Sanremo station. By bus: Buses run from the Sanremo bus station to Bussana Nuova on a regular basis; during the summer, there are sometimes shuttle buses going to Bussana Vecchia from Bussana Nuova or directly from Sanremo.

Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Sapporo, Japan, from 3 to 13 February 1972. A total of 1,006 athletes representing 35 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 35 events from 10 different sports and disciplines. Seventeen NOCs won at least one medal and fourteen of them collected at least one gold. The Soviet Union finished at the top of the gold and overall medal counts with 8 and 16, respectively. Along with Norway, the Soviet team also won the most silver medals (5). East Germany, which ended the Games behind the Soviet Union with 14 medals, secured the most bronzes (7). The host nation, Japan, won a record total of three medals (one of each color), which included its first Winter Olympics gold medal. Three NOCs won a single medal: Canada (silver), Poland and Spain (gold). For the last two, these were their first-ever gold medals at the Winter Olympics, and in the case of Spain, it was its first medal. This was Canada's weakest result since the 1936 Winter Olympics, when its athletes also brought home a single silver medal. The NOCs from the Republic of China and the Philippines sent athletes to the Winter Olympics for the first time, but failed to win any medals. Highlights Hosting the Olympic Winter Games for the first time, Japan's record consisted of a single medal: a silver in alpine skiing at the 1956 Winter Olympics. In Sapporo, Yukio Kasaya, Akitsugu Konno, and Seiji Aochi won the ski jumping normal hill (70 m) gold, silver, and bronze medal, respectively. Kasaya's gold was Japan's first-ever at the Winter Games. This result would persist as the country's best for the next 20 years. Wojciech Fortuna of Poland won the ski jumping's large hill (90 m) event, while Spain's Francisco Fern√°ndez Ochoa prevailed in the alpine skiing's men's slalom, thus becoming their respective countries' first Winter Olympic champions. Ochoa's gold medal was also Spain's first medal at the Winter Games. Karen Magnussen's silver in the figure skating singles competition was Canada's sole medal and reflected what was the NOC's weakest performance since the 1936 Winter Games. For the first time in its history, a delegation from Finland concluded its participation at the Winter Olympics without gold medals. Six Soviet Union medals were won by two cross- country skiers: Galina Kulakova, who took gold in both women's individual distances and in the relay event; and Vyacheslav Vedenin, who won the 30 km‚Äîbecoming the first Soviet skier to win an individual Olympic title‚Äîand the relay events, and came third in the 50 km. East German lugers won eight medals for their NOC by taking every medal in the men's and women's singles, and placing two teams in the top three of the doubles event. Paul Hildgartner and Walter Plaikner of Italy were the only non-East German athletes to win a luge medal, as they shared the doubles gold with Horst H√∂rnlein and Reinhard Bredow. Italy's other gold medal was won by Gustav Th√∂ni in the men's giant slalom; he also took silver in the men's slalom, thus contributing two of his country's five medals. Marie-Theres Nadig skied her way to victory in the women's downhill and giant slalom events, winning half of Switzerland's gold medals and helping her country achieve its best result at that time. Two-time world figure skating champion Ondrej Nepela added the Olympic men's singles title to his career and guaranteed Czechoslovakia's second and last gold medal in its Winter Olympics history. Half of the United States' eight medals were obtained in women's speed skating: Anne Henning won a gold in the 500 m and a bronze in the 1000 m, while Dianne Holum grabbed a gold in the 1500 m and a silver in the 3000 m. Also in this discipline, Ard Schenk (three golds), Stien Baas-Kaiser (one gold and one silver), Atje Keulen-Deelstra (one silver and two bronzes), and Kees Verkerk (one silver) were responsible for all nine medals for the Netherlands. This was the best performance by a Dutch delegation at the Winter Olympics, and it took 26 years to be improved, when the Games returned to Japan. Medal table The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals won by an NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. In the doubles event in luge, two gold medals were awarded for a first place tie and, consequently, no silver medal was awarded. This explains the 36 gold and 34 silver medals distributed during the Games. Notes # Switzerland also collected a total of 10 medals at the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, but it won only three golds versus the four obtained in Sapporo. # The Netherlands summed nine medals in Sapporo, just like at the 1968 Winter Olympics, but won four golds, one more than in Grenoble.

However, DNA testing has failed to detect bobcat marker genes, and Pixie-bobs are considered wholly domestic for the purposes of ownership, cat fancy registration, and import and export. History In the spring of 1985, Carol Ann Brewer purchased near Mount Baker, Washington, a unique male cat with a spotted coat, a short tail, and polydactyl paws. In January 1986, she rescued another male cat named Keba, which was very large, had a bobbed tail, and was reported to have been sired by a bobcat. While this cat was starving, it still weighed 17 pounds, and was so tall it reached up to Brewer's knees. Shortly after she had acquired this large male, it mated with a next door neighbor's brown spotted female cat.Founder's Homepage Carol Ann Brewer In April 1986, a litter was born from this mating. Brewer eventually kept one of the female kittens, named \\"Pixie\\", and after a year started a breeding program with Pixie as the foundation cat. Over the next couple of years, Brewer introduced into her program 23 cats from around the nearby Cascade range, that were believed by her to be born from naturally occurring matings between bobcats and domestic cats. She coined the term \\"Legend Cat\\" to refer to such cats and has since registered a trademark in the U.S. to limit the term to describe permitted outcrosses used in her breeding program.Trademark Applications and Registrations Retrieval Serial Number: 77196038 United States Patent and Trademark Office At the same time, other breeders in the U.S. were working with distinctly wild looking barn cats and collaborated with Brewer to establish a broad genetic base and to develop the foundation of today's Pixie-bob. Led by Brewer, they succeeded in registering their new breed with The International Cat Association (TICA) and eventually the American Cat Fancier's Association (ACFA). The Pixie-bob was accepted into the \\"Exhibition\\" category by TICA in 1993, promoted to \\"New Breed and Color\\" status in 1996 and eventually gained Championship status in 1998. The Pixie-bob was classified by TICA initially as a \\"Native New Breed\\", defined as \\"A new breed which has been identified through selection of phenotypically similar individuals from a naturally occurring population indigenous to a particular geographic region\\" but it is now classified as an established breed. Physical characteristics The brown spotted tabby coat of the Pixie-bob (short-haired) Pixie-bobs are a fully domestic breed of cat selected and bred to resemble the North American bobcat. Pixie-bobs can be large but on average reach around 11 lb (5 kg), similar to good sized domestic cats, with only very few breeders producing consistently large cats. Males are usually larger than females. The average domestic cat weighs about 8 lb (4 kg).Fast facts about the domestic cat Pixie-bobs grow for 4 years instead of 1 year like most domestic cats. Most Pixie-bobs have black fur and skin on the bottom of their paws, tipped ears, heavy ear hair, black lips, and white fur around the eyes but with black eye skin. Their chins have white fur, but often have black skin under the white fur. Some of their whiskers change from black (root ‚Äì about 25%) to white (to the tip ‚Äì about 75% of the whisker). Bobcat- like fur pattern, but often have reddish tones mixed in. Most are short- haired, but some are long-haired. The brow should be heavy and the eyes should have a triangular shape. Eyes are blue when kittens, then change to green or gold when several months old. Tails can be non-existent (rumpy), or 2-4 inches (5‚Äì10 cm) (desired ‚Äì TICA required), or long tails (StoneIsland Pixie was a long-tail). The head is pear-shaped. The head is considered to be the most important characteristic. It is not presently known what genetic similarity there may or may not be between the Pixie-bob and other breeds with suppression of the tail, such as the Manx, American Bobtail, and Japanese Bobtail. Temperament Pixie-bobs are said to be highly intelligent, social, active, bold, and enjoy playing with other animals. They are also known for their \\"chirps\\", chatters, and growls; most do not meow often, and some do not meow at all. Most Pixie-bobs are highly sociable around both their owners and strangers. Almost all Pixie-bobs like to be in the same room as their owners, and will follow their owners around the house. Other personality characteristics include the following: * Head butting * Ball fetching and playing * Leash walking (for the most part) * Highly intelligent * Capable of understanding some human words and phrases Health As the breed is frequently outcrossed to \\"legend cats\\", Pixie-bobs are genetically diverse and are not prone to problems caused by inbreeding. Pixie-bob breeders use a disease database, Pawpeds, to ensure that health information can be recorded and monitored. Some rare genetic diseases includes the following: * Cryptorchidism - only a few cases have been recorded, since the conception of this breed in the 1980s. * Dystocia and cystic endometrial hyperplasia - A very small percentage of Pixie-bobs do suffer from delivery problems, and are removed from breeding. * Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) - Since the advent of the Pixie-bob breed in the 1980s, only a few cases have been reported. In some of those cases the Pixie-bob was cross-bred with other breeds of cats, such as Bengal and Maine Coon. In the majority of cases, HCM occurred spontaneously. HCM is hereditary in at least 50% of occurrences necessitating annual ultrasound screens to confirm continued health of the cats.

Magic or mana is an attribute assigned to characters within a role-playing or video game that indicates their power to use special magical abilities or \\"spells\\". Magic is usually measured in magic points or mana points, shortened as MP. Different abilities will use up different amounts of MP.\\"The History of Mana: How an Austronesian Concept Became a Video Game Mechanic\\", June 17, 2014, Alex Golub, Assistant Professor of Anthropology, University of Hawai‚Äòi at MƒÅnoa. When the MP of a character reaches zero, the character will not be able to use special abilities until some of their MP is recovered. Much like health, magic might be displayed as a numeric value, such as \\"50/100\\". Here, the first number indicates the current amount of MP a character has whereas the second number indicates the character's maximum MP. In video games, magic can also be displayed visually, such as with a gauge that empties itself as a character uses their abilities. History The magic system in tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons is largely based on patterns established in the Dying Earth novels of author Jack Vance. In this system, the player character can only memorize a fixed number of spells from a list of spells. Once this spell is used once, the character forgets it and becomes unable to use it again. \\"Mana\\" is a word that comes from Polynesian languages meaning something along the lines of \\"supernatural power\\". The concept of mana was introduced in Europe by missionary Robert Henry Codrington in 1891 and was popularized by Mircea Eliade in the 1950s. It was first introduced as a magical fuel used to cast spells in the 1969 short story, \\"Not Long Before the End\\", by Larry Niven, which is part of and later popularized by his The Magic Goes Away setting. It has since become a common staple in both role-playing and video games. Mechanisms Because skills and abilities are not usually lost, a game designer might decide to limit the use of such an ability by linking its use to magic points. This way, after using an ability, the player is required to rest or use an item to replenish their character's MP. This is done for balancing, so that each skill does not have an infinite casting ability with equal results every time. \\"Magic\\" may be substituted with psychic powers, spiritual power, advanced technology or other concepts that would allow a character to influence the world around them that is not available in real life. Magic is often restricted to a specific class of character, such as a \\"mage\\" or \\"spellcaster\\", while other character classes have to rely on melee combat or physical projectiles. Other character classes, such as those that rely on melee attacks, may also have a \\"magic\\" bar that limits their special abilities, although they are usually called something different, such as the Barbarian's \\"Fury\\" in Diablo 3. In video games, MP can often be restored by consuming magic potions or it may regenerate over time. Status effects are temporary modification to a game character's original set of stats. A character may cast a spell that inflicts a positive or negative status effect on another character. =In role-playing games= In both tabletop role-playing games and role-playing video games, magic is most usually used to cast spells during battles. However, in tabletop RPGs, unlike in video games, magic has many uses outside of combat situations, such as using love spells on NPCs to gain information. Some games base the strength and amount of a character's magic on stats such as \\"wisdom\\" or \\"intelligence\\". These stats are used because they are easy to keep track of and develop in pen-and-paper RPGs. Some games introduce a separate point system per skill. For example, in the Pok√©mon games, each skill of each fighting character has its own \\"Power Points\\" (PP). If the PP of only one of its skills are depleted, that specific Pok√©mon still has three other skills to choose from. =In god games= In god games, the player's power is usually called mana and grows along with the number and prosperity of the player's worshipers. Here, the population size influences the maximum amount of mana the player has and the rate at which their mana restores itself when it is below that maximum. Using \\"godly powers\\" consumes mana, but such actions are necessary to increase the number and prosperity of the population.

Woolloomooloo is 1.5 kilometres east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Sydney. It is in a low-lying, former docklands area at the head of Woolloomooloo Bay, on Sydney Harbour. The Domain sits to the west, the locality of East Sydney is near the south-west corner of the suburb and the locality of Kings Cross is near the south-east corner. Potts Point is immediately to the east. Woolloomooloo was originally a working-class district of Sydney and has only recently changed with gentrification of the inner city areas of Sydney. The redevelopment of the waterfront, particularly the construction of the housing development on the Finger Wharf, has caused major change. Areas of public housing (Housing NSW a.k.a. \\"Housing Commission\\") still exist in the suburb. History =Aboriginal culture= The current spelling of Woolloomooloo is derived from the name of the first homestead in the area, Wolloomooloo House, built by the first landowner John Palmer. There is debate as to how Palmer came up with the name with different Aboriginal words being suggested. Anthropologist J.D. McCarthy wrote in 'NSW Aboriginal Places Names', in 1946, that Woolloomooloo could be derived from either Wallamullah, meaning place of plenty or Wallabahmullah, meaning a young black kangaroo. In 1852, the traveller Col. G.C. Mundy wrote that the name came from Wala-mala, meaning an Aboriginal burial ground. It has also been suggested that the name means field of blood, due to the alleged Aboriginal tribal fights that took place in the area, or that it is from the pronunciation by Aborigines of windmill, from the one that existed on Darlinghurst ridge until the 1850s. Woolloomooloo Bay in 1855 (watercolour) =European settlement= After the First Fleet's arrival in Sydney, the area was initially recognised as Garden Cove or Garden Island Cove after the nearby small wooded Garden Island, off the shore. The first land grant was given to John Palmer in 1793 to allow him to run cattle for the fledgling colony. In the 1840s the farm land was subdivided into what is now Woolloomooloo, Darlinghurst and parts of Surry Hills. Originally the area saw affluent residents building grand houses, many with spectacular gardens, attracted by the bay and close proximity to the city and Government House. The area slowly started to change after expensive houses were built in Elizabeth Bay and further east and a road was needed from Sydney. It was for this reason that William Street was built, dividing the land for the first time. =Trams= The Woolloomooloo tram line opened in stages between 1915 and 1918. This line branched off from Park Street and ran north along Haig Avenue, St John Young Crescent and Lincoln Crescent to Brown's Wharf at Woolloomooloo. Through service ran from Circular Quay via Elizabeth and Park Streets. The line was an early closure, in 1935, being replaced by a bus service from Pyrmont. = Green ban = In February 1973, the Builders Labourers Federation placed a two-year long green ban on the suburb to stop the destruction of low- income housing and trees. It succeeded and 65% of the houses were placed under rent control.  Heritage listings  Woolloomooloo has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Cowper Wharf Road: Finger Wharf * 43-51 Cowper Wharf Road: The Gunnery, Woolloomooloo Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 4,011 people in Woolloomooloo. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.1% of the population. * 45.4% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were England 6.3% and New Zealand 3.3%. * 61.8% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 2.6%. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 38.7% and Catholic 19.3%. Landmarks Overlooking Woolloomooloo from the Domain Park, with the Bells Hotel (red brick building) in the foreground Woolloomooloo is home to the Finger Wharf, known for its remarkable size. It is long and wide and stands on 3,600 piles. The Sydney Harbour Trust built the Finger Wharf, or Woolloomooloo Wharf, between 1911 and 1915 with the charter to bring order to Sydney Harbour's foreshore facilities. The wharf became the largest wooden structure in the world. The area's commerce was dominated by shipping at the wharf and by the regular influx of sailors and officers from the Garden Island base of the Royal Australian Navy. The wharf's influence diminished for Woolloomooloo during the 1970s when other more modern wharves were preferred. By the 1980s the wharf lay derelict and empty and in 1987, the state government decided to demolish the Wharf. A new complex was approved to replace the wharf in Woolloomooloo Bay, but when demolition work was due to begin in January 1991, locals blocked entrance to the site. Unions imposed a green ban, which stopped demolition crews from undertaking work. Aerial view In the mid-1990s the wharf was renovated into 300 private residential apartments and a boutique hotel with 104 guestrooms. It also has several restaurants and bars, including the popular Water Bar, frequented by many visiting celebrities. At first, the hotel was launched as \\"W Sydney - Woolloomooloo\\" and was the W Hotels brands' first internationally launched property outside of the United States. The hotel's licensing expired in 2007 and rebranded as \\"Blue Hotel\\", managed by Taj Hotels & Resorts. Notable residents include actor Russell Crowe, who lives in a $14 million penthouse which as a result has become famous in Australia and abroad and one of the most expensive and sought after places in the country. Another prominent resident is controversial former Australian radio presenter John Laws.

It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1771. Dreyer described it as \\"very bright, very rich, very large.\\" M46 is about 4,920 light-years away. There are an estimated 500 stars in the cluster with a combined mass of , and it is thought to be some 251.2 million years old. The cluster has a tidal radius of and a core radius of . It has a greater spatial extend in the infrared than in visible light, suggesting that the cluster is undergoing some mass segregation with the fainter (redder) stars migrating to a coma region. The fainter stars that extend out to the south and west may form a tidal tail due to a past interaction. The planetary nebula NGC 2438 appears to lie within the cluster near its northern edge (the faint smudge at the top center of the image), but it is most likely unrelated since it does not share the cluster's radial velocity. It is an example of a superimposed pair possibly similar to that of NGC 2818. On the other hand, the illuminating star of the bipolar Calabash Nebula shares the radial velocity and proper motion of Messier 46, and is at the same distance, so is a bona fide member of the open cluster. M46 is located close by to another open cluster, Messier 47. M46 is about a degree east of M47 in the sky, so the two fit well in a binocular or wide-angle telescope field.

The village is beside the River Cam, close to where a southern branch of the Icknield Way crossed the river. The eastern and southern boundaries of the parish form part of the county boundary with Essex, and the Essex town of Saffron Walden is only about southeast of the village. The village is mainly grouped around three streets: Abbey Street, Frogge Street, and Church Street, which leads into Brookhampton Street. The village is at the eastern end of its parish, which extends to the west. Archaeology A Neolithic axe-head has been found in the parish, suggesting a human presence before 2500 BC. About southwest of the village near Valance Farm is a late Bronze Age bowl barrow, close to the supposed route of the pre- Roman Icknield Way. The barrow and its surrounding ditch are well-preserved, about in diameter and high. Other Bronze Age remains found in the parish include a spear-head, a gold bracelet and a torq. South of the village on the side of Coploe Hill is a series of earth banks that may also be Bronze Age. They start about south of the village and extend south, as far as the Essex county boundary. About south of the parish church, just west of Frogge Street, is the site of a Roman villa. The site is just across the River Cam from the site of a Roman fort at Great Chesterford. The villa was of modest size, and it had an outhouse or barn. The site was excavated in 1842. About north of the village, just over the boundary in Duxford parish, is the site of a Romano- British settlement. Manors Wrought iron village sign There are records of continuous Anglo-Saxon settlement at Ickleton for at least 1,000 years. Its toponym is derived from Old English, meaning \\"Icel's farm\\" or \\"estate associated with a man named Icel\\". In the late 10th or early 11th century Elfhelm of Wratting, a thegn of King Edgar the Peaceful, left one hide of land at Icelingtune to his kinsman, also called Elfhelm. In the reign of Edward the Confessor in the middle of the 11th century, 20 hides of land were being farmed in the parish. Squitrebil held 19 of them from the King, and Estred held the other hide from √Ülfgar, Earl of Mercia. After the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 most English estates were taken from their owners and granted to Norman barons. In 1067 William the Conqueror granted the manor of Hichelintone to Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, making Ickleton part of the Honour of Boulogne. The Domesday Book of 1086 records 43 tenants in the parish, In 1125 Stephen of Blois and Eustace II's granddaughter, Matilda of Boulogne, were married, making Stephen Count of Boulogne jure uxoris. In 1135 Stephen became King of England and in 1141 he granted Ickleton to Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex. However, Mandeville became an outlaw in 1143 and was killed in 1144, and Ickleton seems to have reverted to the Crown. In about 1150 Stephen and Maud granted Ickleton to Eupheme, second wife of Aubrey de Vere, 1st Earl of Oxford, as a wedding present. In about 1153 Eupheme granted ¬£5 worth of land at Ickleton to Colne Priory. By the end of that year Eupheme had died and the rest of Ickleton seems to have reverted to the Honour of Boulogne. When William I, Count of Boulogne died in 1159, King Henry II took possession of the Honour. =Lesser estates= There was a number of smaller manors in the parish. Valence or Vallance By 1162 the hospital at Montmorillon in Poitou, France held an estate at Ickleton. The steward of William I, Count of Boulogne had granted the land, and the Hundred Rolls of 1279 recorded that it covered about and was tenanted by one Thomas the deacon. In 1300 Montmorillon hospital conveyed the estate to Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. In 1305 Thomas relinquished his tenancy, and the Earl granted the estate to a Sir John Wollaston for the rest of the latter's life. When the Earl died in 1324 he left the estate to his granddaughter Elizabeth de Comyn, but it continued to be called the Valence manor. Elizabeth and her husband Richard Talbot, 2nd Baron Talbot sold the manor in 1332 and it changed hands again in 1333, 1334 and 1344. In 1344 Valence manor was bought jointly by John Illegh, who was rector of Icklingham, Suffolk and Thomas Keningham, a fellow of Michaelhouse, Cambridge. In 1345 Illegh made over his share of the estate to Michaelhouse. In 1546 during the Reformation Michaelhouse was dissolved by Act of Parliament, along with King's Hall, Cambridge, and the two were merged to form Trinity College, Cambridge. The Valence manor was granted to the new college, and in 1612 it was expanded to . When Ickleton parish was inclosed in 1814 Trinity College was allotted , which was named Vallance Farm. It increased this to by 1946, when Vallance Farm was sold. There was a Valence manor house by 1324, and there are subsequent records of it in 1461 and 1508. It may have been the same as the Valence manor house recorded in 1612, 1685 and 1726 on the south side of Mill Lane. It was a substantial house with six rooms on the ground floor and two solars upstairs. The present Vallance farm in Grange Road has a brick farmhouse built in about 1825 for Trinity College's tenant. The Hovells, a 16th-century former manor house that was the seat of one of Ickleton's lesser estates Hovells By 1183 Ralph Brito held land at Ickleton of the Honour of Boulogne. By 1221 it had passed by marriage to Robert Hovel, whose bride was the daughter of Ralph's heir Thomas Brito. In 1222 a William Brito released a carucate of land to Hovel. The small estate passed to a Ralph Hovel and came to be called Hovells Manor. In 1253 Ralph Hovel confirmed a grant of of land, apparently Hovells Manor at Ickleton, to the Cistercian Tilty Abbey in Essex. Certainly Tilty Abbey held Hovells Manor by 1279, when the Hundred Rolls recorded that it covered . Under the feudal system Tilty Abbey held the estate of Robert Hovel, who in turn held it of the Honour of Boulogne. The present Hovells house in Frogge Street was the manor house. It is an early 16th-century timber-framed building, altered and extended in the 17th century. Durham's By 1199 Hamon Walter, a younger brother of Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler and the Archbishop of Canterbury Hubert Walter had granted a small estate at Ickleton called Durhams Manor to the Premonstratensian West Dereham Abbey in Norfolk. In about 1235 it was assessed at one hide. The Hundred Rolls record that in 1279 the Abbey held in Ickleton about \\"of Robert the son of Ryenold the knight\\" and possibly of Ickleton Priory. The present Durham's Farmhouse in Butcher's Hill is a late 16th-century timber-framed building with 17th-century or later additions. Caldress or Caldrees Before 1213 the Cistercian Calder Abbey in Cumberland had received land and half a watermill at Ickleton from Richard de Luci. The estate came to be called Caldress Manor after the Abbey, which in 1279 held it of Thomas de Multon. This would seem to be the Thomas de Multon who was a descendant of Thomas de Multon, Lord de Luci, father of Thomas de Multon, 1st Baron Multon of Gilsland and died in 1287. The present Caldress Manor house in Abbey Street may have 16th- or 17th-century origins. It was added to in about 1800. Later in the 19th century the house was altered again for Robert Herbert, first Premier of Queensland, Australia, who was born in Ickleton. The original part of the house is timber-framed and the additions are brick. Norman Hall, a 15th-century house with 16th-century and later alterations, became the seat of Brays manor until 1867 Brays In 1279 John le Bray held land at Ickleton, and in 1302 the same or a later John le Bray held land at Ickleton of the Honour of Boulogne. By 1346 the holding had passed to a John Sawston but it was still called Brays manor. It then passed through different owners and the record of succession is incomplete until 1523. In 1604 a member of the Crudd family (see Mowbrays, below) bought much of the land, and by 1704 Brays and Mowbrays manors were owned by the same Thomas Crudd. He died unmarried in 1714, leaving both manors to the Hanchett family, into which two of his sisters had married. In the inclosure of 1814 Samuel Hanchett was allotted . Brays stayed in the Hanchett family until it was sold in 1867. Robert Herbert (see Caldress or Caldrees, above) bought part of the land but sold much of it in 1873. There was a messuage with Brays manor in 1279, but by 1545 the house on the site had gone. By 1730 the house for the manor was Little Farm, east of the churchyard. This was later combined with the house next door to form Norman Hall, which in 1867 was sold and ceased to be a farmhouse. The oldest part of Norman Hall is not Norman at all but a 15th-century timber-framed medieval hall with a cross-wing. It was altered in the 16th century and added to in the 18th and 19th centuries. The exterior is finished with a combination of flint, brick and 18th-century pargetting. Limburys By 1279 Roger de Neville held about of demesne under Thomas de Multon. In 1302 Philip de Neville held of a knight's fee at Ickleton, which by 1316 had passed to Sir John Limbury. In 1335 Sir John was Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and held at Ickleton of the de Multons. The estate passed to Sir John's heirs and descendants and came to be called Limburys manor. In 1433 Elizabeth, Lady Swinburne (n√©e Limbury) died and in 1456 her executor sold the manor with about to Clare Hall, Cambridge. Limbury manor had a messuage by 1279 and two in 1388 and 1389. In 1545 the farmstead was in Frog Street. In 1704 the farm-buildings were still there but there was no house. After Clare Hall bought Mowbrays manor in 1819 it let Limburys and Mowbrays together and the tenants lived at Mowbrays (see below). The present house called Limburys is a flint rubblestone house in Abbey Street dating probably from the early to mid 19th century. Mowbrays In 1279 the heirs of a William de Beauchamp of Bedford held at Ickleton of West Dereham Abbey (see above). This descended by a female heir to the Mowbray family, and when John de Mowbray, 4th Baron Mowbray died in 1368 is estate included 30 acres at Ickleton held of the Honour of Boulogne. He left the estate to his son Thomas, who in 1397 was created 1st Duke of Norfolk. The manor stayed in the Mowbray family until John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk and his wife Elizabeth conveyed it to feoffees in 1469. The estate continued to be called Mowbrays manor, and in the 1540s it was among lands bought by an Ickleton yeoman, John Crudd, who enlarged the estate. Mowbrays descended in the Crudd family and its heirs the Hanchett, Warner and Brooke families. A Mrs Brooke held more than in 1810 and died leaving the estate to her children in 1812. They were allocated south of the village in the inclosure of 1814, which they then sold to Clare College, Cambridge in 1819. The college still owned the farm in 1972. Mowbrays seems to have had no manor house in the 14th century but there may have been one in 1438. The present house called Mowbrays in Church Street is a late 15th- or early 16th-century timber-framed, jettied, gabled building, which originally had a central hall and two cross-wings. Late in the 17th century it was raised to two storeys and a west wing was added. Red-brick diagonal chimneystacks were built, which have the date 1690 scratched on them. The back of the house is decorated with pargetting. Mowbrays is a Grade II* listed building. Sir Robert Herbert, Lord of the Manor 1859‚Äì1905, encouraged many of Ickleton's young men to emigrate to Queensland =Later history= After 1538 the manors of Hovells, Caldress and Durhams, along with the estate of the former Ickleton Priory (see below) descended together, but legally remained separate entities. In 1600 Martin Heton, the new Bishop of Ely, surrendered the four manors to the Crown, which in 1602 sold them to a John Wood of nearby Hinxton, who had already been leasing the land. In 1623 Wood sold the combined estate to the Holgate family of Saffron Walden, with whom it remained until at least 1717. By 1719 the Holgates had sold the estate to the Irish peer Henry O'Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond. Ickleton was inherited by the 8th Earl's nephew Percy Wyndham-O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond in 1741 and by George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont in 1774. The 3rd Earl gave Ickleton to his younger brother the Hon. Percy Charles Wyndham in 1784, who thereafter lived at Caldress Manor. In 1833 Wyndham left Ickleton Manor to his nephew Algernon Herbert, an Oxford scholar and antiquary who became a barrister of the Inner Temple. Herbert died at Ickleton in 1855, leaving the manor to his young son Robert Herbert (born 1831), who also became a barrister at the Inner Temple but made his career as a colonial civil servant. Robert (later Sir Robert) Herbert never married, and died at Ickleton in 1905 leaving the manor to a descendant of his uncle Rev. William Herbert. The estate eventually descended to William Herbert's great- grandson Percy Mundy, who died in 1959. Priory, weekly market and annual fair Abbey Farm, said to be on the site of Ickleton Priory Ickleton Priory was a small house of Benedictine nuns, founded in the mid-12th century. It existed certainly by 1181 and may have been founded in or before 1163. The priory was dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. The priory was neither large nor wealthy, but it became Ickleton's principal manor and dominated the life of the parish. By 1536 it held of the cultivated land in the parish, but in that year the priory was suppressed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the last prioress was pensioned off by the Crown. A charter issued under Henry III between 1222 and 1227 granted the prioress the right to hold at Ickleton a weekly market, an annual fair and a court leet. The charter may have been in confirmation of an earlier one that the priory claimed was granted by King Stephen. The market was every Thursday and the annual fair was on the feast of St Mary Magdalene, 22 July. The annual fair survived the priory's suppression. In the latter part of the 16th century it was still being held in the former priory's barnyard, still took place around the feast day of St Mary Magdalene, and lasted five days. In the 18th and early 19th century it was a one-day event on the feast day itself, trading mainly in horses and cheese. In 1872 the fair was owned by the farmer of Abbey Farm when the Home Secretary, Henry Bruce, abolished Ickleton Fair under the Fairs Act 1871. Rectory In the Middle Ages the parish rectory lands were appropriated to Ickleton Priory and treated as a single estate with the priory's own lands. When the priory was suppressed in 1536 the combined estate passed to the Crown (see above) so the rectory continued only as tithes from the parishioners. In 1547 the Crown granted Ickleton rectory to the Dean and Canons of Windsor. By 1579 the Wood family, tenants of the demesne, were in dispute with the Dean and Canons over tithe payments. The dispute was still continuing in 1620, despite consistent court judgement in favour of the Dean and Canons. Eventually the tithes were commuted from payment in kind to money in lieu. In 1776 the Dean and Canons proposed reverting to payments in kind, to which the villagers objected. In the inclosure of 1814 the Dean and Canons received in lieu of tithes. The Dean and Canons leased the rectory and hence the tithe income. Lesees included the Dean of Arches, William Bird from 1615 to 1624 and Sir William Acton, 1st Baronet from 1630. Lessees after the inclosure of 1814 included Lieutenant- General William Inglis in 1861‚Äì62. In 1867 the Dean and Canons' estates were vested in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The Commissioners sold the estate in 1920. Places of worship =Church of England= The Anglican parish church is St Mary Magdalene Church, Ickleton. =Early Dissenters= By 1669 a few villagers in Ickleton were Dissenters, probably Quakers. The number of Dissenters slowly grew, and in 1690 they invited two ministers from Cambridge to preach at Ickleton every third Sunday. Their numbers remained small throughout the 18th century, for most of which time they used a barn as their meeting-place. The congregation had no resident minister, relying instead on ministers from Cambridge, Linton and Saffron Walden. =Congregationalism= In 1842 a Congregational chapel and schoolhouse were built in Ickleton. The chapel was successful enough to be enlarged in 1876 and 1896, after which it could seat 200 people and was served fortnightly by the Congregational minister from Duxford. It was closed in about 1954, sold in 1956 and derelict by 1972. =Methodism= In 1824 there were Methodists meeting in two houses in Ickleton. The 1851 Census recorded 80 people meeting for evening worship led by a Primitive Methodist minister from Saffron Walden. The Primitive Methodist chapel in Abbey Street was built the following year, in 1852. It could seat 160 people, and in 1877 had 95 people in its congregation. The chapel was still in use for worship in 1972 but has since closed. =Salvation Army= The Salvation Army briefly ministered in Ickleton, having a hall that was recorded in 1899 and 1903. Economic and social history =Population= The number of Ickleton's inhabitants has been in the low hundreds throughout its history. Early documents record the number of tenants, households or adults rather than total population, so there are no precise figures until the 1801 Census. The number of tenants rose from 43 at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 to 115 in the Hundred Rolls of 1279. The number of households was 68 in 1563 and 65 in 1662, but rose sharply to 98 in 1666. In 1707 there were 120 families and in the 1801 Census there were 121, and this first census counted a total population of 493 people. The population grew for the next half-century, peaking at 813 in the 1851 Census. Ickleton depended almost entirely on farming and in 1707 many of the families had been poor. Both conditions still applied 150 years later, so many of Ickleton's young men emigrated. Robert Herbert, who inherited the Manor of Ickleton in 1855 and joined the colonial service, encouraged many of them to settle in Queensland, Australia. Herbert was Premier of Queensland 1859‚Äì66 and a civil servant at the Colonial Office in London 1866‚Äì92. After 1851 Ickleton's population fell for seven decades, until after the First World War the 1921 Census recorded a low of 543 people. Thereafter the number slowly increased again, but then reached a new low of 526 in the 1971 Census. Since then it has increased substantially, possibly encouraged by the arrival of the M11 motorway in 1979 and the electrification of the railway to in 1987 (see Transport, below). The 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 709. Ickleton's early 19th-century former tower mill, now a private house =Mills= The Domesday Book records that in 1086 the parish had two watermills, presumably on the River Cam. One was at Ickleton itself, and the other was at Brookhampton just north of the village. By 1432 the road now called Mill Lane was called the fulling-mill street. The mill at the village had gone by 1545, but in 1818 a new watermill was built on the south side of the village. In 1927 the last miller was killed in the water-wheel and the mill was closed. By 1432 one of the hills of the parish was called Windmill Hill, suggesting that the parish had a windmill by then. By 1545 the windmill was on or close to its present site, about northwest of the village, west of Duxford Road. Early in the 19th century it was replaced with a brick-built tower mill. The mill closed soon after 1900, and by 1925 it had been converted into a house. =Historic houses= The Ickleton Lion, the only pub still trading in the village The village prospered in the 15th and 16th centuries. A number of buildings survive from that time: Mowbrays in Church Street has already been noted (see Lesser estates, above). Padcot in Abbey Street is another Grade II* listed building dating from about 1500. It is a timber- framed building, originally one house and later divided into two cottages. It was built as a hall house, but early in the 17th century a floor was inserted in part of the house. The house has a cross wing with a crown post roof. =Public houses= Ickleton Social Club Ickleton has had a number of public houses. In 1592 there was the Bell, and in the same century there was an inn that may have been called the Rose. In the 17th century there was the White Lion, which was in Church Street south of the village green and burnt down before 1699. The Chequer was built in the same site and was recorded in 1778. By 1847 it was called the Duke of Wellington. In about 1957 it ceased trading and it is now a private house. It is a timber-framed building from the end of the 17th century with 19th-century additions. By 1728 there was a pub in Abbey Street called the Lion. This may be the same as the Red Lion recorded in 1800, which is a timber-framed building dating from about 1700 with 18th and 19th century alterations. It is currently called the Ickleton Lion and is controlled by Greene King Brewery. There was a New Inn in Brookhampton Street that was trading in 1884. and The Greyhound in the south of the parish on the edge of Great Chesterford was open by 1851 and still trading in 1972. It closed before the end of the 20th century. As well as the Ickleton Lion, the village has a social club. =Schools= Former parish school, now the village hall There are records from 1601 and 1625 that Ickleton had a schoolmaster, and from 1638 and 1678 that part of the church was used as the schoolroom. However, the school later lapsed and it was not until 1804 that the vicar started a Sunday school. There was a day school in the parish by 1825 and two by 1833, which seem to have been dame schools. In 1846 a British School was opened in the Congregational chapel's schoolroom. It had 70 pupils an 1870, was still open in 1888 but there is no later record of it. The vicar started a Church of England day school in about 1848 in a room in Mill Lane. A purpose- built school and schoolmaster's house for the school in Church Street were completed in 1871 and enlarged in 1884. The number of pupils increased from 57 in 1872 to 103 in 1888. The school closed in 1961, was bought by the village and converted into the village hall. =Transport= In 1845 the Eastern Counties Railway opened its extension from (Essex) down the Cam Valley to , and beyond. The line crosses the river at Ickleton and skirts the eastern edge of the parish. The nearest station is across the river at , about southeast of Ickleton village. British Rail electrified the line in 1987. It is now the West Anglia Main Line. In 1979 the M11 Motorway was extended from Stansted in Essex to Stump Cross, about east of Ickleton on the Essex‚ÄìCambridgeshire boundary. In 1980 the motorway was extended again, from Junction 9 to Cambridge, passing through Ickleton parish only about west of the village. Current amenities The village shop and post office As well as the Ickleton Lion and Ickleton Social Club, the village has a combined village shop and post office and a few small businesses providing employment in the village, notably Team Consulting, a medical device design & development consultancy, based at the Abbey Barns business campus.

It is named after Alberto Cantino, an agent for the Duke of Ferrara, who successfully smuggled it from Portugal to Italy in 1502. It measures 220 x 105 cm. This planisphere is the earliest surviving map showing Portuguese geographic discoveries in the east and west, and is particularly notable for portraying a fragmentary record of the Brazilian coast, which the Portuguese explorer Pedro √Ålvares Cabral explored in 1500, and for depicting the African coast of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans with a remarkable accuracy and detail. History Tordesillas line depicted - Cantino planisphere detail Major wind rose of the Cantino planisphere In the beginning of the 16th century, Lisbon was a buzzing metropolis where people from diverse backgrounds came in search of work, glory or fortune. There were also many undercover agents looking for the secrets brought by the Portuguese voyages to remote lands. Among them was Alberto Cantino, who was sent to Portugal by Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, with the formal intention of horse trading, while secretly collecting information on Portuguese Discoveries. Cantino's diligence is shown in one of his five remaining letters to the Duke, dated 17 October 1501, where he describes, amongst other things, hearing Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real detailing his latest voyage to Newfoundland (Terra Nova) to King Manuel I. A popular theory, introduced in the earliest studies of the map,Duarte Leite (1923), 225-32 suggests that the Cantino Planisphere was ordered to an official Portuguese mapmaker, who made a copy of the royal cartographic pattern, the so-called Padr√£o Real, kept in the Armaz√©ns da √çndia. However, there is no historical evidence that such order was ever made and the theory is weakened by the presence of numerous mistakes. One would expect a carefully made copy of an official standard, if it existed in Portugal at that time, would be accurate.Gaspar (2012), 181-82 A more plausible explanation is that the map was surreptitiously acquired shortly after it was made for some nobleman or official client.Gaspar (2010), 182; 195 From a letter sent by Cantino to his patron, the Duke of Ferrara, on 19 November 1502, we know that he paid 12 golden ducats for it, which was a considerable amount for the time. An Italian inscription in the back of the map reads: Carta de navigar per le Isole nouam trovate in le parte de India: dono Alberto Cantino al S. Duca Hercole, which translates as 'Navigational chart of the islands recently [discovered]... in part of the Indies: from Alberto Cantino to Duke Hercole'. While it enlightened the Italians to many new territories yet unknown to them, it was obsolete within months due to subsequent mapping voyages by the Portuguese. Nevertheless, its importance to the Portuguese‚ÄìItalian trade relations should not be understated; this map provided the Italians with knowledge of Brazil's coastline and that of much of the Atlantic Coast of South America long before other nations even knew South America extended so far to the south. It also supplied great details of the Indian Ocean. A peninsula to the northeast of Cuba has been identified by some others as Florida while others argue that it was actually intended to represent part of China, Cuba itself, or the Yucatan Peninsula. The geographical information given on the Cantino map was copied into the Italian-made Canerio (or Caveri) map shortly after the Cantino map arrived in Italy and the Canerio, in turn, became the primary source for the design of the newly discovered western lands on the highly influential wall map of the world produced by Martin Waldseem√ºller in 1507 under the auspices of Rene, Duke of Lorraine. This old map, made-up by 6 glued parchment sheets, was kept in the Ducal Library, Ferrara, for about 90 years, until Pope Clement VIII transferred it to another palace in Modena, Italy. More than two centuries later, in 1859, the palace was ransacked and the Cantino Map lost. It was found by Giuseppe Boni, Director of the Biblioteca Estense, in that same year, in a butcher's store in Modena. The Cantino world map can currently be found in Modena, Italy, at the Biblioteca Estense.  Construction  The rhumb-line construction scheme and geographic lines in the Cantino planisphere. Adapted from Gaspar (2012), Plate 3 The Cantino planisphere is the earliest extant example of the so-called latitude chart, which was developed following the introduction of astronomical navigation, during the second half of the fifteenth century. Contrarily to the portolan charts of the Mediterranean, which were constructed on the basis of magnetic courses and estimated distances between places, in the latitude chart places were represented according to their latitudes. In the Cantino planisphere, latitudes were incorporated only in the coasts of Africa, Brazil and India, while Europe and the Caribbean Sea continued to be represented according to the portolan-chart model Gaspar (2012), 129-82). The construction of the rhumb line system in the Cantino planisphere uses two circles (some charts use only one, others use as many as three, depending of size): the western circle is centered on the Cape Vert Islands, the eastern circle is centered in India. The circumference of each circle is marked with sixteen equally spaced points, from which radiate the 32 classic rhumbs: 0¬∞, 11 1/4¬∞, 22 1/2¬∞, 33 3/4¬∞, etc. The western and eastern outer circles are tangent to each other at a large wind-rose in central Africa, with a fleur-de-lis indicating North. This dense rhumb-line mesh was used in navigation as a reference, for reading and marking directions (courses) between places. Six scale bars graduated in Iberian leagues, with a variable number of sections (or logs), are distributed over the chart's area. These were used to measure distances between places. Illustrations are few, but elaborate. Two cities are grandly depicted - Venice and Jerusalem. There is also an elaborate depiction of the Portuguese castle of S√£o Jorge da Mina (Elmina Castle, on the Gold Coast of west Africa), flanked by two African towns. Other illustrations include a lion-shaped mountain representing the Sierra Leone mountain range, the Alexandria lighthouse (laid horizontal), the mythical Mountains of the Moon (legendary source of the Nile River) in central Africa, and either the Table Mountain or Drakensberg range in South Africa. Along the central African coast are the various cross stone markers (padr√µes) erected by Diogo C√£o and Bartolomeu Dias in the 1480s. In north Africa, there is the \\"Montes Claros\\" in the usual place of the Atlas mountains, the legend below on the left reading that \\"this is the land of King Organo, whose king is very noble and very rich\\", and to the right that this is the \\"land of the King of Nubia, the king of which is continuously making war on Prester John and is a moor and a great enemy of Christians\\".  Discoveries  The Brazilian coast was certainly the last to be added and reached its present form in three phases: to the first belong an initial coastline running to southeast from Golfo fremosso to Cabo Sam Jorge, and from there, to north of Porto Seguro, continuing further south to the tip of the landmass. Only a relatively small portion of the coast, between the flag near the Vera cruz inscription and the northern side of the baia de todos os santos would have been surveyed, in 1500, by the fleet of Pedro √Ålvares Cabral. To the second phase belongs the pasting of the strip of parchment between Rio de s√£ franc¬∞ and Golfo fremosso, which would have been based on the information brought by the fleet of Jo√£o da Nova, who arrived in Lisbon in September 1502. In the third phase the island namedquaresma, together with some names written in cursive would have been added.Roukema (1963), p. 7-8 The European rediscovery of Greenland is thought to have been by Jo√£o Fernandes Labrador and Pedro de Barcelos between 1495 and 1498, and also visited by Giovanni Caboto (John Cabot), in the English expedition of 1498. But the depiction of the island on the map suggests it was based on the Portuguese mission of Labrador and Barcelos. Newfoundland was probably visited by an English expedition in 1497‚Äì98, and again, by the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real in 1500 and 1501. The map makes clear that the land was discovered and charted for Portugal by Gaspar Corte-Real, for King Manuel I of Portugal.  North America  Fragment of 1502 Cantino map, showing Cuba and land to its northwest. A depiction of what might be Florida from the 1502 Cantino map Newfoundland, which was visited in 1500 and 1501 by Gaspar Corte-Real and his brother Miguel, members of the Portuguese royal household, is labeled as Terra del Rey de Portuguall on the Cantino map. According to certain authors, a stretch of mainland North American coastline is represented on the Cantino map. If the peninsula drawn northwest of Cuba represented the coasts of Florida, it would mean it had been discovered 11 years before Ponce de Le√≥n got credit for discovering it in 1513. However, other authors dismiss that theory and identify that peninsula with the mainland of Asia, which Columbus believed to have reached, or with the Yucat√°n Peninsula.

It was later independently discovered again, under the current name NGC 2422. There is actually no cluster in the position indicated by Messier, which he expressed in terms of its right ascension and declination with respect to the star 2 Puppis. However, if the signs of Messier's coordinate differences are changed, the position matches that of NGC 2422. Until the equivalency of M47 with NGC 2422 was found, M47 was considered a lost Messier Object. The discovery that M47 and NGC 2422 were the same cluster only came in 1959 with a realization by Canadian astronomer T. F. Morris. M47 is at a distance of about 1,600 light- years from Earth with an estimated age of about 78 million years. The member stars of M47 have been measured down to about red dwarfs at apparent magnitude 19. There are around 500 members, the brightest being HD 60855, a magnitude 5.7 Be star. The cluster is dominated by hot class B main sequence and giant stars, but a noticeable colour contrast comes from several bright red giants. M47 is located about a degree away from Messier 46, which is much older and much further away.

It is defined by the inability of a person to process and perceive stimuli on one side of the body or environment, where that inability is not due to a lack of sensation. Hemispatial neglect is very commonly contralateral to the damaged hemisphere, but instances of ipsilesional neglect (on the same side as the lesion) have been reported. Presentation Hemispatial neglect results most commonly from strokes and brain unilateral injury to the right cerebral hemisphere, with rates in the critical stage of up to 80% causing visual neglect of the left- hand side of space. Neglect is often produced by massive strokes in the middle cerebral artery region and is variegated, so that most sufferers do not exhibit all of the syndrome's traits. Right-sided spatial neglect is rare because there is redundant processing of the right space by both the left and right cerebral hemispheres, whereas in most left-dominant brains the left space is only processed by the right cerebral hemisphere. Although it most strikingly affects visual perception ('visual neglect'), neglect in other forms of perception can also be found, either alone or in combination with visual neglect. For example, a stroke affecting the right parietal lobe of the brain can lead to neglect for the left side of the visual field, causing a patient with neglect to behave as if the left side of sensory space is nonexistent (although they can still turn left). In an extreme case, a patient with neglect might fail to eat the food on the left half of their plate, even though they complain of being hungry. If someone with neglect is asked to draw a clock, their drawing might show only the numbers 12 to 6, or all 12 numbers might be on one half of the clock face with the other half distorted or blank. Neglect patients may also ignore the contralesional side of their body; for instance, they might only shave, or apply make-up to, the non-neglected side. These patients may frequently collide with objects or structures such as door frames on the side being neglected. Neglect may also present as a delusional form, where the patient denies ownership of a limb or an entire side of the body. Since this delusion often occurs alone, without the accompaniment of other delusions, it is often labeled as a monothematic delusion. Neglect not only affects present sensation but memory and recall perception as well. A patient suffering from neglect may also, when asked to recall a memory of a certain object and then draw said object, draw only half of the object. It is unclear, however, if this is due to a perceptive deficit of the memory (to the patient having lost pieces of spatial information of the memory) or whether the information within the memory is whole and intact but simply being ignored, the same way portions of a physical object in the patient's presence would be ignored. Some forms of neglect may also be very mild‚Äîfor example, in a condition called extinction where competition from the ipsilesional stimulus impedes perception of the contralesional stimulus. These patients, when asked to fixate on the examiner's nose, can detect fingers being wiggled on the affected side. If the examiner were to wiggle his or her fingers on both the affected and unaffected sides of the patient, the patient will report seeing movement only on the ipsilesional side. =Effects= Though it is frequently underappreciated, unilateral neglect can have dramatic consequences. It has more negative effect on functional ability, as measured by the Barthel ADL index, than age, sex, power, side of stroke, balance, proprioception, cognition, and premorbid ADL status. Its presence within the first 10 days of a stroke is a stronger predictor of poor functional recovery after one year than several other variables, including hemiparesis, hemianopsia, age, visual memory, verbal memory, and visuoconstructional ability. Neglect is probably among the reasons patients with right hemisphere damage are twice as likely to fall as those with left-side brain damage. Patients with neglect take longer to rehabilitate and make less daily progress than other patients with similar functional status. Patients with neglect are also less likely to live independently than patients who have both severe aphasia and right hemiparesis. Causes Brain areas in the parietal and frontal lobes are associated with the deployment of attention (internally, or through eye movements, head turns or limb reaches) into contralateral space. Neglect is most closely related to damage to the temporo-parietal junction and posterior parietal cortex. The lack of attention to the left side of space can manifest in the visual, auditory, proprioceptive, and olfactory domains. Although hemispatial neglect often manifests as a sensory deficit (and is frequently co-morbid with sensory deficit), it is essentially a failure to pay sufficient attention to sensory input. Although hemispatial neglect has been identified following left hemisphere damage (resulting in the neglect of the right side of space), it is most common after damage to the right hemisphere . This disparity is thought to reflect the fact that the right hemisphere of the brain is specialized for spatial perception and memory, whereas the left hemisphere is specialized for language - there is redundant processing of the right visual fields by both hemispheres. Hence the right hemisphere is able to compensate for the loss of left hemisphere function, but not vice versa. Neglect is not to be confused with hemianopsia. Hemianopsia arises from damage to the primary visual pathways cutting off the input to the cerebral hemispheres from the retinas. Neglect is damage to the processing areas. The cerebral hemispheres receive the input, but there is an error in the processing that is not well understood. Theories of mechanism Researchers have argued whether neglect is a disorder of spatial attention or spatial representation. =Spatial attention= Spatial attention is the process where objects in one location are chosen for processing over objects in another location. This would imply that neglect is more intentional. The patient has an affinity to direct attention to the unaffected side. Neglect is caused by a decrease in stimuli in the contralesional side because of a lack of ipsilesional stimulation of the visual cortex and an increased inhibition of the contralesional side. In this theory, neglect is seen as disorder of attention and orientation caused by disruption of the visual cortex. Patients with this disorder will direct attention and movements to the ipsilesional side and neglect stimuli in the contralesional side despite having preserved visual fields. The result of all of this is an increased sensitivity of visual performance in the unaffected side. The patient shows an affinity to the ipsilesional side being unable to disengage attention from that side. =Spatial representation= Spatial representation is the way space is represented in the brain. In this theory, it is believed that the underlying cause of neglect is the inability to form contralateral representations of space. In this theory, neglect patients demonstrate a failure to describe the contralesional side of a familiar scene, from a given point, from memory. To support this theory, evidence from Bisiach and Luzzatti's study of Piazza del Duomo can be considered. For the study, patients with hemispatial neglect, that were also familiar with the layout of the Piazza del Duomo square, were observed. The patients were asked to imagine themselves at various vantage points in the square, without physically being in the square. They were then asked to describe different landmarks around the square, such as stores. At each separate vantage point, patients consistently only described landmarks on the right side, ignoring the left side of the representation. However, the results of their multiple descriptions at the different vantage points showed that they knew information around the entire square, but could only identify the right side of the represented field at any given vantage point.When asked to switch vantage points so that the scene that was on the contralesional side is now on the ipsilesional side the patient was able to describe with details the scene they had earlier neglected. The same patterns can be found with comparing actual visual stimuli to imaging in the brain (Rossetti et al., 2010). A neglect patient who was very familiar with the map of France was asked to name French towns on a map of the country, both by a mental image of the map and by a physical image of the map. The image was then rotated 180 degrees, both mentally and physically. With the mental image, the neglect stayed consistent with the image; that is, when the map was in its original orientation, the patient named towns mostly on the East side of France, and when they mentally rotated the map they named towns mostly on the West side of France because the West coast was now on the right side of the represented field. However, with the physical copy of the map, the patient's focus was on the East side of France with either orientation. This leads researchers to believe that neglect for images in memory may be disassociated from the neglect of stimuli in extrapersonal space. In this case patients have no loss of memory making their neglect a disorder of spatial representation which is the ability to reconstruct spatial frames in which the spatial relationship of objects, that may be perceived, imagined or remembered, with respect to the subject and each other are organized to be correctly acted on. This theory can also be supported by neglect in dreams (Figliozzi et al., 2007).Doricchi, F.; Iaria, G.; Silvetti, M.; Figliozzi, F.; Siegler, I. (2007). \\"The \\"ways\\" we look at dreams: evidence from unilateral spatial neglect (with an evolutionary account of dream bizarreness\\". Experimental Brain Research: 450-461. The study was run on a neglect patient by tracking his eye movements while he slept, during the REM cycle. Results showed that the majority of the eye movements were aimed to his right side, indicating that the images represented in his dreams were also affected by hemispatial neglect. Another example would be a left neglect patient failing to describe left turns while describing a familiar route. This shows that the failure to describe things in the contralesional side can also affect verbal items. These findings show that space representation is more topological than symbolic. Patients show a contralesional loss of space representation with a deviation of spatial reference to the ipsilesional side. In these cases we see a left-right dissimilarity of representation rather than a decline of representational competence. Diagnosis In order to assess not only the type but also the severity of neglect, doctors employ a variety of tests, most of which are carried out at the patient's bedside. Perhaps one of the most-used and quickest is the line bisection. In this test, a line a few inches long is drawn on a piece of paper and the patient is then asked to dissect the line at the midpoint. Patients exhibiting, for example, left-sided neglect will exhibit a rightward deviation of the line's true midpoint. Another widely used test is the line cancellation test. Here, a patient is presented with a piece of paper that has various lines scattered across it and is asked to mark each of the lines. Patients who exhibit left-sided neglect will completely ignore all lines on the left side of the paper. Visual neglect can also be assessed by having the patient draw a copy of a picture with which they are presented. If the patient is asked to draw a complex picture they may neglect the entire contralesional side of the picture. If asked to draw an individual object, the patient will not draw the contralesional side of that object. A patient may also be asked to read a page out of a book. The patient will be unable to orient their eyes to the left margin and will begin reading the page from the center. Presenting a single word to a patient will result in the patient either reading only the ipsilesional part of the word or replacing the part they cannot see with a logical substitute. For example, if they are presented with the word \\"peanut\\", they may read \\"nut\\" or say \\"walnut\\". =Varieties= Neglect is a heterogenous disorder that manifests itself radically differently in different patients. No single mechanism can account for these different manifestations. A vast array of impaired mechanisms are found in neglect. These mechanisms alone would not cause neglect. The complexity of attention alone‚Äîjust one of several mechanisms that may interact‚Äîhas generated multiple competing hypothetical explanations of neglect. So it is not surprising that it has proven difficult to assign particular presentations of neglect to specific neuroanatomical loci. Despite such limitations, we may loosely describe unilateral neglect with four overlapping variables: type, range, axis, and orientation. Type Types of hemispatial neglect are broadly divided into disorders of input and disorders of output. The neglect of input, or \\"inattention\\", includes ignoring contralesional sights, sounds, smells, or tactile stimuli. Surprisingly, this inattention can even apply to imagined stimuli. In what's termed \\"representational neglect\\", patients may ignore the left side of memories, dreams, and hallucinations. Output neglect includes motor and pre-motor deficits. A patient with motor neglect does not use a contralesional limb despite the neuromuscular ability to do so. One with pre- motor neglect, or directional hypokinesia, can move unaffected limbs ably in ipsilateral space but have difficulty directing them into contralesional space. Thus a patient with pre-motor neglect may struggle to grasp an object on the left side even when using the unaffected right arm. Range Hemispatial neglect can have a wide range in terms of what the patient neglects. The first range of neglect, commonly referred to as \\"egocentric\\" neglect, is found in patients who neglect their own body or personal space. These patients tend to neglect the opposite side of their lesion, based on the midline of the body, head, or retina. For example, in a gap detection test, subjects with egocentric hemispatial neglect on the right side often make errors on the far right side of the page, as they are neglecting the space in their right visual field. The next range of neglect is \\"allocentric\\" neglect, where individuals neglect either their peri-personal or extrapersonal space. Peri-personal space refers to the space within the patient's normal reach, whereas extrapersonal space refers to the objects/environment beyond the body's current contact or reaching ability. Patients with allocentric neglect tend to neglect the contralesional side of individual items, regardless of where they appear with respect to the viewer. For example, In the same gap detection test mentioned above, subjects with allocentric hemispatial neglect on the right side will make errors on all areas of the page, specifically neglecting the right side of each individual item. This differentiation is significant because the majority of assessment measures test only for neglect within the reaching, or peri-personal, range. But a patient who passes a standard paper-and-pencil test of neglect may nonetheless ignore a left arm or not notice distant objects on the left side of the room. In cases of somatoparaphrenia, which may be caused by personal neglect, patients deny ownership of contralesional limbs. Sacks (1985) described a patient who fell out of bed after pushing out what he perceived to be the severed leg of a cadaver that the staff had hidden under his blanket. Patients may say things like, \\"I don't know whose hand that is, but they'd better get my ring off!\\" or, \\"This is a fake arm someone put on me. I sent my daughter to find my real one.\\" Axis Most tests for neglect look for rightward or leftward errors. But patients may also neglect stimuli on one side of a horizontal or radial axis. For example, when asked to circle all the stars on a printed page, they may locate targets on both the left and right sides of the page while ignoring those across the top or bottom. In a recent study, researchers asked patients with left neglect to project their midline with a neon bulb and found that they tended to point it straight ahead but position it rightward of their true midline. This shift may account for the success of therapeutic prism glasses, which shift left visual space toward the right. By shifting visual input, they seem to correct the mind's sense of midline. The result is not only the amelioration of visual neglect, but also of tactile, motor, and even representational neglect. Orientation An important question in studies of neglect has been: \\"left of what?\\" That is to say, what frame of reference does a subject adopt when neglecting the left half of his or her visual, auditory, or tactile field? The answer has proven complex. It turns out that subjects may neglect objects to the left of their own midline (egocentric neglect) or may instead see all the objects in a room but neglect the left half of each individual object (allocentric neglect). These two broad categories may be further subdivided. Patients with egocentric neglect may ignore the stimuli leftward of their trunks, their heads, or their retinae. Those with allocentric neglect may neglect the true left of a presented object, or may first correct in their mind's eye a slanted or inverted object and then neglect the side then interpreted as being on the left. So, for example, if patients are presented with an upside-down photograph of a face, they may mentally flip the object right side up and then neglect the left side of the adjusted image. In another example, if patients are presented with a barbell, patients will more significantly neglect the left side of the barbell, as expected with right temporal lobe lesion. If the barbell is rotated such that the left side is now on the right side, patients will more significantly neglect the left side of the object, even though it is now on the right side of space. This also occurs with slanted or mirror-image presentations. A patient looking at a mirror image of a map of the World may neglect to see the Western Hemisphere despite their inverted placement onto the right side of the map. Various neuropsychological research studies have considered the role of frame of reference in hemispatial neglect, offering new evidence to support both allocentric and egocentric neglect. To begin, one study conducted by Dongyun Li, Hans-Otto Karnath, and Christopher Rorden examined whether allocentric neglect varies with egocentric position. This experimental design consisted of testing eleven right hemispheric stroke patients. Five of these patients showed spatial neglect on their contralesional side, while the remaining six patients showed no spatial neglect. During the study, the patients were presented with two arrays of seven triangles. The first array ran from southwest to northeast (SW-NE) and the second array ran from southeast to northwest (SE-NW). In a portion of the experimental trials, the middle triangle in the array contained a gap along one side. Participants were tested on their ability to perceive the presence of this gap, and were instructed to press one response button if the gap was present and a second response button if the gap was absent. To test the neglect frame of reference, the two different arrays were carefully situated so that gap in the triangle fell on opposite sides of the allocentric field. In the SW-NE array, the gap in the triangle fell on the allocentric right of the object-centered axis along which the triangle pointed. In the SE-NW configuration, the gap in the triangle fell on the allocentric left of the object-centered axis. Furthermore, varying the position of the arrays with respect to the participant's trunk midline was used to test egocentric neglect. The arrays were therefore presented at 0¬∞ (i.e. in line with the participant's trunk midline), at ‚àí40¬∞ left, and at +40¬∞ right. Ultimately, varying the position of the array within the testing visual field allowed for the simultaneous measurement of egocentric neglect and allocentric neglect. The results of this experimental design showed that the spatial neglect patients performed more poorly for the allocentric left side of the triangle, as well as for objects presented on the egocentric left side of the body. Furthermore, the poor accuracy for detecting features of the object on the left side of the object's axis was more severe when the objects were presented on the contralesional side of the body. Thus, these findings illustrate that both allocentric and egocentric biases are present simultaneously, and that egocentric information can influence the severity of allocentric neglect. A second study, conducted by Moscovitch and Behrmann, investigated the reference frame of neglect with respect to the somatosensory system. Eleven patients with parietal lobe lesions and subsequent hemispatial neglect were analyzed during this experiment. A double simultaneous stimulation procedure was utilized, during which the patients were touched lightly and simultaneously on the left and right side of the wrist of one hand. The patients were tested both with their palms facing down and with their palms facing up. This experimental condition allowed the scientists to determine whether neglect in the somatosensory system occurs with respect to the sensory receptor surface (egocentric) or with respect to a higher-order spatial frame of reference (allocentric). The results of this experiment showed the hemispatial neglect patients neglected somatosensory stimuli on the contralesional side of space, regardless of hand orientation. These findings suggest that, within the somatosensory system, stimuli are neglected with respect to the allocentric, spatial frame of reference, in addition to an egocentric, sensory frame of reference. Ultimately, the discoveries made by these experiments indicate that hemispatial neglect occurs with respect to multiple, simultaneously derived frames of reference, which dictate the nature and extent of neglect within the visual, auditory, and tactile fields. Treatment Treatment consists of finding ways to bring the patient's attention toward the left, usually done incrementally, by going just a few degrees past midline, and progressing from there. Rehabilitation of neglect is often carried out by neuropsychologists, occupational therapist, speech-language pathologists, neurologic music therapists, physical therapists, optometrists, and orthoptists. Forms of treatment that have been tested with variable reports of success include prismatic adaptation, where a prism lens is worn to pull the vision of the patient towards the left, constrained movement therapy where the \\"good\\" limb is constrained in a sling to encourage use of the contralesional limb. Eye- patching has similarly been used, placing a patch over the \\"good\\" eye. Pharmaceutical treatments have mostly focused on dopaminergic therapies such as bromocriptine, levodopa, and amphetamines, though these tests have had mixed results, helping in some cases and accentuating hemispatial neglect in others. Caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) has been shown to bring about a brief remission in some cases. however this technique has been known to elicit unpleasant side-effects such as nystagmus, vertigo and vomiting. A study done by Schindler and colleagues examined the use of neck muscle vibration on the contralesional posterior neck muscles to induce diversion of gaze from the subjective straight ahead. Subjects received 15 consecutive treatment sessions and were evaluated on different aspects of the neglect disorder including perception of midline, and scanning deficits. The study found that there is evidence that neck muscle stimulation may work, especially if combined with visual scanning techniques. The improvement was evident 2 months after the completion of treatment. Other areas of emerging treatment options include the use of prisms, visual scanning training, mental imagery training, video feedback training, trunk rotation, galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS). Of these emerging treatment options, the most studied intervention is prism adaptation and there is evidence of relatively long-term functional gains from comparatively short-term usage. However, all of these treatment interventions (particularly the stimulation techniques) are relatively new and randomised, controlled trial evidence is still limited. Further research is mandatory in this field of research in order to provide more support in evidence-based practice. In a review article by Pierce & Buxbaum (2002), they concluded that the evidence for Hemispheric Activation Approaches, which focuses on moving the limb on the side of the neglect, has conflicting evidence in the literature. The authors note that a possible limitation in this approach is the requirement for the patients to actively move the neglected limb, which may not be possible for many patients. Constraint-Induced Therapy (CIT), appears to be an effective, long-term treatment for improving neglect in various studies. However, the use of CIT is limited to patients who have active control of wrist and hand extension. Prism Glasses, Hemispatial Glasses, and Eye-Patching have all appear to be effective in improving performance on neglect tests. Caloric Stimulation treatment appears to be effective in improving neglect; however, the effects are generally short-term. The review also suggests that Optokinetic Stimulation is effective in improving position sense, motor skills, body orientation, and perceptual neglect on a short-term basis. As with Caloric Stimulation treatment, long-term studies will be necessary to show its effectiveness. A few Trunk Rotation Therapy studies suggest its effectiveness in improving performance on neglect tests as well as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Some less studied treatment possibilities include treatments that target Dorsal Stream of visual processing, Mental Imagery Training, and Neck Vibration Therapy. Trunk rotation therapies aimed at improving postural disorders and balance deficits in patients with unilateral neglect, have demonstrated optimistic results in regaining voluntary trunk control when using specific postural rehabilitative devices. One such device is the Bon Saint C√¥me apparatus, which uses spatial exploratory tasks in combination with auditory and visual feedback mechanisms to develop trunk control. The Bon Saint C√¥me device has been shown to be effective with hemiplegic subjects due to the combination of trunk stability exercises, along with the cognitive requirements needed to perform the postural tasks.

It is native to North Africa, temperate Asia, Europe and tropical Asia (Jammu and Kashmir). Description It grows in water that is deep and likes large ponds and lakes. The leaves can be up to in diameter and take up a spread of per plant. The flowers are white and they have many small stamens inside. Taxonomy It was first published and described by Carl Linnaeus in his book 'Species Plantarum', on page 510 in 1753. The red variety (Nymphaea alba f. rosea) is cultivated from lake Fagert√§rn (\\"Fair tarn\\") in the forest of Tiveden, Sweden, where they were discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery led to a large-scale exploitation which nearly made it extinct in the wild before it was protected. Nymphaea candida J. Presl is sometimes considered a subspecies of N. alba (N. alba L. subsp. candida (J. Presl) Korsh.). Distribution and habitat They are found all over Europe and in parts of North Africa and the Middle East in fresh water. In Africa, it is found in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. In temperate Asia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Siberia, Iran, Iraq, Israel and Turkey. It is found in tropical Asia, within the Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir. Lastly, within Europe, it is found in Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russian Federation, Ukraine Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, France, Portugal and Spain. Phytochemistry It contains the active alkaloids nupharine and nymphaeine, and is a sedative and an aphrodisiac/anaphrodisiac depending on sources. Although roots and stalks are used in traditional herbal medicine along with the flower, the petals and other flower parts are the most potent. Alcohol can be used to extract the active alkaloids, and it also boosts the sedative effects. The root of the plant was used by monks and nuns for hundreds of years as an anaphrodisiac, being crushed and mixed with wine. In the earliest printed medical textbooks, authors maintained this use, though warning against consuming large and frequent doses.

His surname changed twice: he was born with the name Wesley, which he changed to Wesley-Pole following an inheritance in 1781. In 1789 the spelling was updated to Wellesley-Pole, just as other members of the family had changed Wesley to Wellesley. Origins The young William Wesley aged 14, painted in 1777 by Benjamin West He was born as William Wesley, at Dangan Castle, the second son of Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington, by his marriage to the Hon. Annie Hill, a daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon. He was the younger brother of Richard Wesley, later Marquess Wellesley, and the elder brother of Arthur, who became Duke of Wellington, and of Henry, who became Lord Cowley. Early life Wesley was educated at Eton (1774‚Äì1776) before entering the Royal Navy as a midshipman, serving in the Navy between 1777 and 1783; most notably aboard HMS Lion, a new ship launched in 1777, at the Battle of Grenada of 1779.National Maritime Museum Records, Greenwich Pole inheritance William Pole (died 1781), of Ballyfin, Ireland, who at his death bequeathed his estate to William Wesley Due to the debts of their father, the Wesley family entered into financial stringency. This was partially alleviated following the death in 1781 of the childless William Pole, of Ballyfin in Ireland, his godfather and the husband of his great-aunt Ann Colley, who bequeathed his estates to Wesley, on the condition which was usual in such situations that he should adopt the surname \\"Pole\\". Pole was descended from Peryam Pole, third son of the antiquary Sir William Pole (1561‚Äì1635) of Shute House, Devon, a brother of Sir John Pole, 1st Baronet. He had married Ann Colley, the sister of Wesley's grandfather Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington (1690‚Äì1758). This Wesley had been born Richard Colley, but had changed his name in 1728, following an inheritance, to Wesley. Thus it was that in 1781, in accordance with the Will of his great-uncle William Pole, Wesley changed his name to Wesley-Pole.Ancestry from Collins Peerage, 1812, (9 vols.) vol. 8, pp. 540‚Äì545 Political career A Tory, Mornington was a Member of the Irish Parliament for Trim from 1783 to 1790 and of the British House of Commons for East Looe from 1790 to 1795 and Queen's County from 1801 to 1821. He served as Secretary of the Admiralty under the Duke of Portland between 1807 and 1809 and as Chief Secretary for Ireland under Spencer Perceval between 1809 and 1812 and was also a Lord of the Irish Treasury between 1809 and 1811 and Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer between 1811 and 1812. Mornington was sworn of both the British Privy Council and the Irish Privy Council in 1809. He served in Lord Liverpool's government from 1814 to 1823 as Master of the Mint. In 1821 he was elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Maryborough, of Maryborough in the Queen's County (now Portlaoise, Co. Laois). In 1823 he was appointed Custos Rotulorum of Queen's County for life. From 1823 to 1830 he was Master of the Buckhounds and from 1834 to 1835 Postmaster-General. From 1838 he held the honorary position of Captain of Deal Castle. Succession to earldom On the death in 1842 of his elder brother Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley and 2nd Earl of Mornington, he succeeded as 3rd Earl of Mornington. Marriage and progeny In 1784 Lord Mornington married Katherine Elizabeth Forbes, daughter of Admiral John Forbes and granddaughter of the George Forbes, 3rd Earl of Granard, and of William Capell, 3rd Earl of Essex. It was said that among the 1st Earl's sons, they had the only happy marriage.

There she became engaged to John Carr Jackson and the couple bought a ranch in Mexico but this did not prosper and the engagement was broken off. She returned to England in 1898 after losing most of her money in a speculative venture.

Second Anglo-Boer War Emily Hobhouse by Henry Walter Barnett When the Second Boer War broke out in South Africa in October 1899, a Liberal MP, Leonard Courtney, invited Hobhouse to become secretary of the women's branch of the South African Conciliation Committee, of which he was president. She wrote > It was late in the summer of 1900 that I first learnt of the hundreds of > Boer women that became impoverished and were left ragged by our military > operations‚Ä¶ the poor women who were being driven from pillar to post, needed > protection and organized assistance.Emily Hobhouse, Anglo-Boer War Museum, > Bloemfontein She founded the Distress Fund for South African Women and Children, and sailed for the Cape Colony on 7 December 1900 to supervise its distribution, and arrived on 27 December. She wrote later: > I came quite naturally, in obedience to the feeling of unity or oneness of > womanhood ... it is when the community is shaken to its foundations, that > abysmal depths of privation call to each other and that a deeper unity of > humanity evinces itself. When she left England, she only knew about the concentration camp at Port Elizabeth, but on arrival found out about the many other camps (45 in total). She had a letter of introduction to the British High Commissioner, Alfred Milner, from her aunt, the wife of Arthur Hobhouse, himself the son of Henry Hobhouse, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Home Office under Sir Robert Peel, and who knew Milner. From him she obtained the use of two railway trucks, subject to the approval of the army commander, Lord Kitchener, which she received two weeks later, although it only allowed her to travel as far as Bloemfontein and take one truck of supplies for the camps, about 12 tons. Conditions in the camps She had persuaded the authorities to let her visit several British concentration camps and to deliver aid. Her report on conditions at the camps, set out in a report entitled \\"Report of a Visit to the Camps of Women and Children in the Cape and Orange River Colonies\\", was delivered to the British government in June 1901. As a result, a formal commission was set up and a team of official investigators headed by Millicent Fawcett was sent to inspect the camps. Overcrowding in bad unhygienic conditions due to neglect and lack of resources were the causes of a mortality rate that in the eighteen months during which the camps were in operation reached a total of 26,370, of which 24,000 were children under sixteen and infants, i.e. the rate at which the children died was some 50 a day. The following extracts from the report by Emily Hobhouse make very clear the extent of culpable neglect by the authorities: > In some camps, two, and even three sets of people, occupy one tent and 10, > and even 12, persons are frequently herded together in tents of which the > cubic capacity is about 500 c.f. > I call this camp system a wholesale cruelty‚Ä¶ To keep these Camps going is > murder to the children. > It can never be wiped out of the memories of the people.

Late in 1901 the camps ceased to receive new families and conditions improved in some camps; but the damage was done. Historian Thomas Pakenham writes of Kitchener's policy turn: > No doubt the continued 'hullabaloo' at the death-rate in these concentration > camps, and Milner's belated agreement to take over their administration, > helped changed K's mind [some time at the end of 1901].

It was effective precisely because, contrary to the Liberals' > convictions, it was less humane than bringing them into camps, though this > was of no great concern to Kitchener. Charles Aked, a Baptist minister in Liverpool, said on 22 December 1901, Peace Sunday: \\"Great Britain cannot win the battles without resorting to the last despicable cowardice of the most loathsome cur on earth‚Äîthe act of striking a brave man's heart through his wife's honour and his child's life. The cowardly war has been conducted by methods of barbarism... the concentration camps have been Murder Camps.\\" Afterwards, a crowd followed him home and broke the windows of his house. =Bloemfontein Concentration Camp= Hobhouse arrived at the camp at Bloemfontein on 24 January 1901 and was shocked by the conditions she encountered: > They went to sleep without any provision having been made for them and > without anything to eat or to drink. I saw crowds of them along railway > lines in bitterly cold weather, in pouring rain‚Äìhungry, sick, dying and > dead. Soap was not dispensed. The water supply was inadequate.

The rations were extremely meagre and when, as I frequently > experienced, the actual quantity dispensed fell short of the amount > prescribed, it simply meant famine. Lizzie van Zyl, visited by Emily Hobhouse in the Bloemfontein concentration camp What most distressed Hobhouse was the sufferings of the undernourished children. Diseases such as measles, bronchitis, pneumonia, dysentery and typhoid had invaded the camp with fatal results. The very few tents were not enough to house the one or more sick persons, most of them children. In the collection Stemme uit die Verlede (Voices from the Past), she recalled the plight of Lizzie van Zyl (1894‚Äì1901), the daughter of a Boer combatant who refused to surrender. The girl died at the Bloemfontein camp. According to Hobhouse, the girl was treated harshly and placed on the lowest rations. After a month, she was moved to the new hospital about 50 kilometres away from the concentration camp, suffering from starvation. Unable to speak English, she was labelled an \\"idiot\\" by the hospital staff, who were unable to understand her. One day she started calling for her mother. An Afrikaner woman, Mrs Botha, went over to comfort her and to tell her she would see her mother again, but \\"was brusquely interrupted by one of the nurses who told her not to interfere with the child as she was a nuisance\\".The Concentration Camps 1899‚Äì1902, boer.co.za; retrieved 23 July 2011. When Hobhouse requested soap for the people, she was told that soap was a luxury. She nevertheless succeeded, after a struggle, to have it listed as a necessity, together with straw, more tents and more kettles in which to boil the drinking water. She distributed clothes and supplied pregnant women, who had to sleep on the ground, with mattresses, but she could not forgive what she called > Crass male ignorance, helplessness and muddling‚Ä¶ I rub as much salt into the > sore places in their minds‚Ä¶ because it is good for them; but I can't help > melting a little when they are very humble and confess that the whole thing > is a grievous and gigantic blunder and presents almost insoluble problems, > and they don't know how to face it. Hobhouse also visited camps at Norvalspont, Aliwal North, Springfontein, Kimberley and Orange River. Fawcett Commission When Hobhouse returned to England she received scathing criticism and hostility from the British government and many of the media, but eventually succeeded in obtaining more funding to help the victims of the war. The British Liberal leader at the time, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, denounced what he called the \\"methods of barbarism\\". The British government eventually agreed to set up the Fawcett Commission to investigate her claims, under Millicent Fawcett, which corroborated her account of the shocking conditions. Hobhouse returned to Cape Town in October 1901, was not permitted to land and was eventually deported five days after arriving, no reason being given. She felt she never received justice for her work. Early the next year Hobhouse went to Lake Annecy in the French Alps where she wrote the book The Brunt of the War and Where it Fell on what she had seen during the war in South Africa. Rehabilitation and reconciliation After the war Hobhouse returned to South Africa where she saw that her mission was to assist in healing the wounds inflicted by the war and to support efforts aimed at rehabilitation and reconciliation. With the help of Margaret Clark she decided to set up a home industries scheme and to teach young women spinning and weaving and lace making so they would have an occupation in their lonely homes. Ill health, from which she never recovered, forced her to return to England in 1908. She traveled to South Africa again in 1913 for the inauguration of the National Women's Monument in Bloemfontein but had to stop at Beaufort West due to her failing health. Her speech which called for reconciliation and goodwill between all races was read for her and received great acclaim. It was during her time there that she met Gandhi. Later life Hobhouse was an avid opponent of the First World War and protested vigorously against it. She organised the writing, signing and publishing in January 1915 of the \\"Open Christmas Letter\\", addressed \\"To the Women of Germany and Austria\\".Oldfield, Sybil. International Woman Suffrage: November 1914 ‚Äì September 1916, p. 46. Taylor & Francis, 2003. . Volume 2 of International Woman Suffrage: Jus Suffragii, 1913‚Äì1920, Sybil Oldfield; . Through her offices, thousands of women and children were fed daily for more than a year in central Europe after this war. South Africa contributed liberally towards this effort, and an amount of more than ¬£17,000 was collected by Mrs. President Steyn (who was to remain a lifelong friend) and sent to Hobhouse for this purpose. South African honorary citizenship She became an honorary citizen of South Africa for her humanitarian work there. Unbeknown to her, on the initiative of Mrs R. I. Steyn, a sum of ¬£2,300 was collected from the Afrikaner nation and with that Emily purchased a house in St Ives, Cornwall, which now forms part of Porthminster Hotel. In this hotel a commemorative plaque, situated within what was her lounge, was unveiled by the South African High Commissioner, Mr Kent Durr, as a tribute to her humanitarianism and heroism during the Anglo Boer War. Death Hobhouse died in Kensington in 1926. Her ashes were ensconced in a niche in the National Women's Monument at Bloemfontein, where she was regarded as a heroine. Her death went unreported in the Cornish press. Legacy The southernmost town in Eastern Free State is named Hobhouse after her. The SAS Emily Hobhouse, one of the South African Navy's three Daphn√© class submarines, was named after her in 1969. In 1994, after the end of minority rule, the submarine was renamed the SAS Umkhonto. In Bloemfontein, South Africa, the oldest residence on the campus of the University of the Free State is named after Hobhouse. There is a statue of Hobhouse at the parish church at St Ive, Cornwall, where she was born.

Some are notable pathogens, including Rickettsia, which causes a variety of diseases in humans, and Ehrlichia, which causes diseases in livestock. Another genus of well-known Rickettsiales is the Wolbachia, which infect about two-thirds of all arthropods and nearly all filarial nematodes. Genetic studies support the endosymbiotic theory according to which mitochondria and related organelles developed from members of this group.Thomas S. (2016). Rickettsiales:Biology, Molecular Biology, Epidemiology, and Vaccine Development. pp.529. Springer‚Ä¢. , The Rickettsiales are difficult to cultivate, because they rely on eukaryotic host cells for their survival.  Rickettsiales phylogeny  The Rickettsiales further consist of three known families, the Rickettsiaceae, the Midichloriaceae, and the Anaplasmataceae. Most studies also support the inclusion of the Holosporaceae, but one study has challenged this view. Here, the Holosporaceae are the sole representatives of their own order, the Holosporales, and as such not part of the Rickettsiales (see the schematic tree below). Other lineages, not clearly part of any family, have been described, as well. Examples include Candidatus Arcanobacter lacustris and Rickettsiales bacterium Ac37b. = Phylogenetic relationship between Rickettsiales and Pelagibacterales (SAR11) = The phylogenetic relationship between these two groups has yet to reach consensus in the scientific literature. Early reports suggested that they represented sister clades to each other. However, later studies suggested that this relationship is false and was due to a phylogenetic artefact, which artificially groups independent AT-rich and fast-evolving lineages (Rickettsiales and Pelagibacterales have both properties) together. Upon correcting for this artefact, the Pelagibacterales form a sister clade to the Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales and Caulobacterales instead. Another study adheres to the sister relationship between the two clades (see schematic tree). In their classification, the relation between the two orders is retained in the subclass, the Rickettsidae, which include the Rickettsiales, the Pelagibacteriales, and the extinct protomitochondrion (mitochondria themselves are not bacteria, but organelles).  Reductive evolution  Rickettsiales genomes are undergoing reductive evolution and are typically small (generally < 1,5 Mbp), AT-rich (generally < 40% GC) with a low coding density (generally < 85%) and a relatively high number of pseudogenes. Reduction in genome size, % GC and coding density and genes are generally attributed to genetic drift and Muller's ratchet. Genetic drift is enhanced in Rickettsiales genomes due to low population sizes (given their endosymbiotic nature) and frequent population bottlenecks. Similarly, Muller's ratchet is activated through the lack of recombination and horizontal gene transfer (the eukaryotic host cell is a natural barrier).

Like the other islands in this part of the lagoon, it was the site one of the earliest settlements in the lagoon which predated the development of Venice. However, these islands then declined and were eventually abandoned. In the 1980s the architect Giancarlo De Carlo built a brightly coloured residential neighbourhood to help to repopulate Mazzorbo. In 2019 its population was 256. It is linked to Burano by a wooden bridge. It was once an important trading centre but is now known for its vineyards and orchards.https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/08/travel-mazzorbo-italy- venice Its main attraction is the fourteenth century church of Santa Caterina. Houses in Mazzorbo Houses in Mazzorbo Geography Mazzorbo is situated next to the island of Burano, to its north, to which it is linked by a bridge, and to the west of the island of Torcello. It lies to the north of the palude di Santa Caterina marsh and to the west of the palude del Monte marsh. The canals around the island are the Canale Borgogni and Canale di Burano channels to the west, the Canale Scomerzera di Mazzorbo channel (the western end of which separates it from Burano) to the south, the Canale Santa Caterina channel (which separates it from the Santa Caterina island) to the east and the Canale di Mazzorbo channel to the north. The latter separates Mazzorbo from the larger Mazzorbetto island. Mazzorbo is linked to the island of Murano and the central part of the lagoon by the Canale Scomerzera di San Giacomo canal. Mazzorbo is part of a group of four islands. To its west there is the island of Santa Caterina to which Mazzorbo is separated by the Santa Caterina channel. The two islands are connected by two bridges. The Santa Caterina island was split into two in 1928 when an extension of the Canale di Mazzorbo channel (the Santa Margherita canal) was dug to connect Mazzorbo‚Äôs northern shore to the Canale Scomerzera San Giacomo canal. To the north there is Mazzorbetto, which is separated by the some-60 m wide Canale di Mazzorbo channel. Although in Italian Mazzorbetto sounds like ‚Äúlittle Mazzorbo,‚Äù it is the largest island of the group. Etymology In the past Mazzorbo was variously called Maioribus or Maiorbo (1137), Maiorbenses (1143) or Maiurbo (1228).Pellegrini,G. B., Dai Veneti ai Venetici, in Storia di Venezia, Vol. 1 - Origini, Et√† ducale, Treccani, 1992 Jacopo Filiasi, a late 18th/early 19th century historian, argued that the origin of the name Mazzorbo was the Latin term Major Urbs, Major Urbi, and Majurbium, Great or Major Town, and that this settlement was the largest town in the whole of Byzantine Venezia Marittima, the coastal area of north-eastern Italy which was under the Byzantines in the 6th century.Filiasi, J., Memorie storiche de' Veneti primi e secondi, Padova, Presso il seminario, 1812 However, the work of many historians, including Roberto Cessi, has shown that Mazzorbo was never mentioned in the ancient and medieval chronicles.Cessi, R., La Repubblica di Venezia e il problema adriatico, Edizioni Scientifiche Italiane, Napoli 1953 Therefore, this hypothesis seems unlikely. It has been suggested that Filiasi‚Äôs interpretation came in the context of the patriotic and aggrandising panegyric typical of 19th century Venice and anti-Austrian rhetoric during the Austrian occupation.Menegaldo, S. Madorbo-Mazzorbo, Note sull‚Äôorigine di un toponimo plavense e lagunare, ‚ÄúProgetto di paesaggio motore dello sviluppo economico‚Äù AIAPP (Associazione italiana di Architettura del Paesaggio) symposium, Mazzorbo, 12 April 2014 In the basis of the lack of mentions of Mazzorbo in the old chronicles, Cristoforo Tentori Spagnuolo, another late 18th/early 19th century historian, argued that the origin of the name Mazzorbo was Medium Urbis, ‚ÄùTown in Between‚Äù or ‚ÄúTown in the Middle‚Äù (of other towns).Abate Cristoforo Tentori Spagnuolo , Saggio sulla storia civile, politica, ecclesiastica e sulla corografia e topografia degli Stati della Repubblica di Venezia ad uso della nobile e civile giovent√π, Book 11, Venice, 1789, pp. 68-69 A Roman stone inscription which was discovered in the 19th century, the Epigrafe Torcellana (Torcello Epigraph), commemorates a donation to the town of Altinum by Tiberius Claudius Nero who, during his consulate (13-14 BCE) built temples, porticoes and gardens. It describes the town, its districts and gates and mentions the Maedium Urbis gate. The inscription was placed on this gate, which was in the northeast of the town. This name also appears in other sources, where it is sometimes written as Medium Urbium or Mediurbium. This was also the name of the sixth district of the town. According to Simone Menegaldo, the refugees from Altinum gave this name to this island because it was in between other islands they settled (Burano, Torcello, and Costanziaco). History It is often held that the settlements in Mazzorbo and the other islands in the northern part of the Lagoon of Venice were built by refugees from the nearby coastal town of Altinum either when it was destroyed by Attila of the Huns in 452 or form the inland areas of the Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia regions when they were conquered by the Lombards in 569-615.Massimiliano Pavan,M., Girolamo Arnaldi, G., Le origini dell'identit√† lagunare, in Storia di Venezia, Vol. 1 - Origini, Et√† ducale - Aquileia, Grado, Malamocco, Treccani, 1992. However, in 1881, archaeologists discovered Mycenaean pottery on the island, which shows that there was already commercial activity in 1600‚Äì1100 BCE.Uggeri, G., La laguna e il mare, in Storia di Venezia, Vol. 1 - Origini, Et√† ducale - Ambiente e insediamenti, Treccani, 1992 Dawkins, R.M., Mycenaean Vases at Torcello, \\"Journal of Hellenic Studies\\", 24, 1904, pp. 125-128 Like the settlements on other islands of the northern part of the lagoon (Torcello, Costanziaco, Ammiana and Burano) Mazzorbo was one of the earliest settlement in the Lagoon which predated the development of Venice. These settlements thrived from the 19th to the 14th century when they were the hub of maritime trade with the Adriatic Sea and the rest of the Mediterranean Sea. Flaminio Corner, an 18th century historian, wrote that \\"[the island of Mazzorbo] is divided into two by a wide canal which flows in the middle and separates the island into a western and eastern part, it lies among other islands, a long time ago it was a breathing space of the Nobles, when they were dedicated to a fruitful maritime trade.\\"Corner, F., Ecclesiae Venetae antiquis monumentis nunc etiam primum editis illustratae ac in decades distributae, vol. I, Venezia, p. 297. Mazzorbo and the other islands in the area declined with the urbanisation of Rivoalto, which developed into the city of Venice and became the dominant centre of the lagoon. Many families moved to Venice. In addition, there was environmental degradation caused by floods which eroded the banks of the islands and various buildings, the expansion of the surrounding marshes and problems with malaria. Eventually, Mazzorbo and other islands in the area were abandoned. With the depopulation of this part of the Lagoon of Venice, many religious institutions were established on these islands. Despite not being a large settlement, Mazzorbo had five monasteries and five parish churches. The monasteries were Santa Eufemia (which was dissolved and demolished in 1768), San Maffio (which was dissolved and demolished during Napoleon's occupation of Venice and its lagoon), Santa Maria Valverde, Santa Maria delle Grazie and Santa Caterina. The parish churches were: San Pietro, San Bartolomeo (which was demolished in 1810 during the Napoleonic occupation), San Angelo, Santo Stefano and Santi Cosma e Damiano.Mazzorbo Scomparsa, With the decline of the island and with the dissolution of churches and monasteries, all of these churches and monasteries, except for the Santa Caterina church, were demolished and no trace of them remains. The above mentioned names (Maioribus, Maiorbo and Maiurbo) referred to a settlement which comprised all of the three-island group (prior to the splitting of the S. Caterina island in 1928). In fact, the San Matteo monastery was on the Santa Caterina island. The Sant' Eufemia monastery was in the southeast of the Mazzorbetto island, along the Canale di Mazzorbo channel and with its entrance facing the Canale Bognoni channel which leads to Torcello. The San Pietro church was at the southwestern end of Mazzorbetto. Not much is known about the life and the politics of Mazzorbo before its abandonment. There are only archival documents which mainly record information about its religious institutions. The monasteries also provided for the education of young noble women. Through this connection with the nobility, the churches and monasteries of Mazzorbo were endowed with artworks by painters and other artists who were renown at the time. Disappeared churches and monasteries =San Pietro Parish Church= The only archival document relating to the parish church of San Pietro is dated to 1207. It was probably Mazzorbo‚Äôs main church. The date of its construction is not known. It seems that it was built with materials from Altinum and thus could be dated to the 7th-8th century. Tradition notes its beauty and the marble columns of its portico and claims that St. Francis and St. Antony preached here. Over the main altar there was a panel with ‚ÄúSt. Peter and St. Paul‚Äù by Pietro Ricchi and over the St. Margaret altar there was the Madonna, St. Bartholomew and St. Margaret panel by Francesco Ruschi.Zanetti, A.M., Descrizione di tutte le pubbliche pitture de la Citt√† di Venezia e isole, Venezia 1733, pag. 459Boschini, M., Le Minere della pittura, Venezia, 1664, p. 547 There was a gilded silver altarpiece which was probably kept in the main altar and then, as noted in a 1681 pastoral visit by the bishop of Torcello, was put at the bottom of a large crucifix in front of the main chapel which shared the nave of the presbytery with an iconostasis with the twelve apostles. It was probably the type of 12th century Venetian goldsmith work inspired by Byzantine iconographic elements. It was made of gilded silver tiles nailed to wooden panels with sacred images which represented the Madonna, the Saints and Christ the Saviour. Archivio Comunale Publico di Venezia, Diocesi di Torcello, v.p. Grimani 1594, v. p. Vianoli 1682.Niero, A., Notizie di Archivio sulle pale di argento delle lagune venete, in ‚ÄúRivista Studi Veneziani‚Äù, Venezia 1979, pag. 281. From the 14th century, Mazzorbo underwent a period of slow decline and became depopulated. San Pietro became impoverished. In 1736, Ferrazzi, a parish priest, complained about having to resort to act as a chaplain for the St. Matthew nuns to get some money because donations to the church were not enough to get by despite getting an annual income from two secular confraternities. With the dissolution of churches and monasteries ordered during Napoleon's occupation of Venice the derelict church was demolished. Now there is only a plot of land which belongs to the current parish church of Santa Caterina. The precious altarpiece was lost. =San Bartolomeo Parish Church= In the eastern part of Mazzorbo there was another very old parish church. It was dedicated to St. Bartholomew There are no documents regarding its foundation. Flaminio Corner wrote that it was dissolved in the 17th century because it was no longer able to sustain itself and was merged with the San Pietro parish church. It was replaced by an oratory at the edge of the parish. In 1775 the bishop of Torcello described it as an oratory with a chaplain.Corner, F., Notizie storiche delle chiese e monasteri di Venezia, e di Torcello, tratte dalle chiese veneziane e torcellane, 1758., p. 589Archivio Comunale Pubblico di Venezia, Diocesi Porcellana, v. p. Da Ponte 1775. Zanetti noted that there was a Saint Bernard panel by Antonio Zanchi.Zanetti, A.M. Descrizione di tutte le pubbliche pitture de la Citt√† di Venezia e isole, Venezia, 1733, p. 459 The oratory was demolished in 1830. A document in the Mazzorbo parish archive it is noted that the materials from its demolition fetched 203 liras. =San Matteo Monastery= In 1218 the bishop of Torcello donated a very old church dedicated to St Mathew to three Benedictine nuns on the island of Costanziaco. This island became uninhabitable due to environmental degradation caused by floods breaking the banks of the island and damaging buildings and malaria. The nuns were moved to Mazzorbo, on the Santa Caterina island, opposite the San Pietro church, on the other side of the canal. Construction of the new monastery begun in 1298. There were disputes in the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1341 the nuns asked to be put under the jurisdiction of the abbot of Piacenza due to disagreements with their superior. The Patriarchs of Constantinople and of Grado were drawn into the dispute. This was resolved by Pope Paul II (1464-71) who had the nuns to submit to the Patriarch of Venice in 1464. In 1521, during the pontificate of Leo X (1513-21), the 50 nuns of S. Matteo were sent to join the 5 nuns of the old Benedictine Monastery of Santa Margherita on the island of Torcello due to minor disciplinary transgressions. In 1806, during the Napoleonic dissolution of Venetian churches and monasteries, S. Matteo was demolished, too. There were many paintings and sculptures in this monastery; 92 paintings and 12 terracotta and wooden sculptures were catalogued. They all have been lost. The Santa Margherita canal (see above) was dug for a better connection between the Scomerzera San Giacomo and Mazzorbo canals on the grounds of this monastery a century later. It was opened in 1928.Zorzi, A, Venezia scomparsa, pp.70,74, 106-10 In the convent‚Äôs church there were four panels by Matteo Ingoli: ‚ÄúSt Helen kneeling with the cross with four putti in the air‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe visit of St. Elizabeth‚Äù, \\"St. Jerome, St. Charles and a blessed abbess‚Äù and \\"St. Margaret and her ascent.‚Äù Above the main altar there was a panel with various saints, a nun and the map of the monastery attributed by Boschini, an art critic, to the Vivarini schools. Modern art historians instead attribute it to Giovanni Mansueti. Today it is kept in Venetian collection of the heirs of the painter Italico Brass. =Santa Eufemia Monastery= Bernardino Scardeonio‚Äôs History of Paduan Antiquity tells that Margherita, a Padua noblewoman, withdrew to Mazzorbo with three noble maidens and founded this monastery. It also records that in 1439 the bishop of Torcello sent the Benedictine nuns of the Sant Angelo monastery on the island of Ammiana, whose numbers had been reduced to three due to environmental degradation and depopulation in that island, to the monastery.Corner, F., Notizie storiche delle chiese e monasteri di Venezia, e di Torcello, tratte dalle chiese veneziane e torcellane, 1758., p. 595 In 1768 the senate of the Republic of Venice dissolved the monastery and its church. The buildings were used for military purposes. In the early 19th century a fort was built here. There is no trace of it left. In Murano there is a well curb which used to be in the courtyard of the monastery. It has this inscription: ‚ÄúIN TEMPO DELLA R.M. SUOR SCOLASTICA PISANI DIG.MA ABBAD. / PUTEUS ACQUAR VIVENTIUMQUAE / FLUUNT IMPETU DE LIBANO / MDLXXXVIII DIE X DECEM‚ÄùPiva, V., Il Patriarcato di Venezia e le sue origini, Venice 1938, vol. I, p. 204Rizzi, A., Vere da pozzo di Venezia, Venezia 1981, p. 95, n. 68 Santa Caterina, the only surviving church This the only surviving church in Mazzorbo. According to a 1715 chronicle by Bernardo Trevisan, a Venetian nobleman, Santa Caterina was built in 783. It was rebuilt between 1283 and 1291 and annexed to a Benedictine nun convent with the same name. The convent was behind the church. It was demolished in 1806 during the Napoleonic dissolution of monasteries. The church was tuned into a parish church. By then it had been in decline. In 1819 it became the only parish church in Mazzorbo. Major restoration work in 1920-25 altered the original structure. Restoration work in 2002 re-established the original bricked wall. Parrocchia di Mazzorbo Chiesa di Santa Caterina di Mazzorbo, Conoscere Venezia, La chiesa di Santa Caterina Its earliest mention is in the acts of a parish synod convened by the bishop of Torcello in 1374. The oldest archival document is a 1398 pledge of loyalty to the bishop of Torcello by the abbess. In the 14th century the nuns experienced hardship. In 1314 the Murano chapter granted them a marsh so that they could benefit from the revenues of its mills. However, this income was not enough, and the number of nuns decreased. In 1432 the revenues of the monastery of Santa Maria della Gaiada on the Tumba della Gaiada island (which was part of the settlement of Ammiana) were incorporated into those of Santa Caterina.Archivio di Stato di Venezia, S. Caterina di Mazzorbo, b. 5 processo 35 In 1492 the dissolved Benedictine monastery of San Nicolo was merged with Santa Caterina. The complex was restored in 1712 by Pietro Tabacco, a nobleman who in the same period founded the Madonna del Rosario church on the Madonna del Monte island, towards Murano. To provide further aid, the Bishop of Torcello merged Santa Caterina with Santa Maria della Gaiada monastery, which had been abandoned. The church has a unique aisle with a ceiling which resembles the hull of a ship dating to the 15th century. There are several paintings. The most important are the ‚ÄúMystical wedding of Saint Katherine‚Äù by Matteo Ponzone and one by Giuseppe Porta. Above the entrance door there is a sculptured marble lunette with the ‚ÄúMystical wedding of Saint Katherine and two Donors.‚Äù Christ is sitting on a throne holding an open book which reads ‚ÄúEGO SUM LUS MUNDI‚Äù in his left hand. With his right hand he puts a ring on the finger of a kneeling St. Katherine. The bell tower was built in the 14th century and has the oldest bell in the lagoon. It dates to 1318. Mazzorbo today Mazzorbo today is a sparsely populated island devoted mainly to agriculture with vegetable growing, vineyards and orchards. Mazzorbetto and Santa Caterina are also devoted to agriculture. In the latter two there are several farmsteads and hardly any inhabitants. At the eastern end of Mazzorbo, by the bridge which connects it to Burano, there is the Scarpa farm. It has a number of buildings, some of which date to the 16th century, vineyards, fruit trees and vegetable areas which are surrounded by a 19th century wall. It was bought by Venice council in 1999 and after it was restored in 2006 it was opened to the public. It has information about the history of local agriculture. The Dordona grape is grown here. This is a fine grape which is native of the lagoon and has been recently been selected from centuries-old vines.Atlante della Laguna [http://www.atlantedellalaguna.it/?q=node/184 Giancarlo De Carlo was an architect who belonged to a new generation of architects who wanted to develop a new type of architecture, one which was better suited to local social and environmental conditions and where man \\"is not reduced to an abstract figure\\". He theorized a more democratic and open \\"participatory architecture\\". In 1979 he built a brightly painted housing neighbourhood to help to repopulate the island.

It was and remains a relatively obscure platform game for the console, having a small following among some players. The game both pays homage to and parodies horror pop culture, alternately featuring enemies and locations based on classic horror icons, and parodic reinterpretations. In the 2000s the game became infamous in online gaming circles when prototype screenshots of a Japanese Famicom version known as began circulating showing different bosses and parodies. No version of the game was ever released in Japan. On May 26, 2011, a prototype of the canceled Japanese release was listed on Yahoo! Japan auctions, closing at a very high price of ¬•483000 (approximately $6000 in American dollars). On July 3, 2014, the unreleased Japanese Famicom version was leaked online.  Story  The story centers on a child named Mark (originally known as Hiroshi („Å≤„Çç„Åó) in the unreleased Japanese prototype) who, on his way home from a baseball game, is approached by a winged, griffin-like alien named Bert (originally known as Value („Éê„É™„É•„Éº) in the unreleased Japanese prototype) who seeks assistance in ridding \\"evil monsters\\" from his realm, \\"Dark World\\". Being the first person he encounters, Bert tries to enlist Mark as his aid in battle. Mark is reluctant to help, but Bert explains that anyone will do, and that Mark's baseball bat will be as good a weapon as any. Bert quickly whisks him away, and on the way to Dark World magically fuses himself to Mark so that they are one being (with Mark able to transform into Bert for a limited time). The bizarre premise and plot introduction sets up a game that is filled with variations on many traditional horror characters and themes (sometimes with ironic twists), as well as relatively novel characters all its own. Some traditional horror bosses the game features include a mummy, giant spiders, zombies, Medusa, a Dragon, and The Grim Reaper. The game also features several enemies drawn from Japanese folklore and Japanese urban legends, such as Banch≈ç Sarayashiki's well and Jinmenken (human faced dogs). Enemies unique to the game include a large, talking caterpillar; walking pants; a giant cat that hurls kittens as projectiles; and a bouncing piece of fried shrimp. After making his way through Dark World and ascending into what appears to be some kind of Heavenly realm, Mark fights and defeats the Dark World Master. His realm now free of monsters, Bert returns Mark home and leaves him with a parting gift for his help. When Mark opens the box, a beautiful princess emerges; after a few seconds, though, she transforms into a hideous monster accompanied by a few monsters who melts Mark's flesh from his bones. Mark suddenly awakens in his bed, his body intact. Believing his adventures in the Dark World was a dream, he prepares to leave the house to school, only to find Bert standing before the front door with Mark's bat. Bert asks Mark if he is ready to go again, and the game ends.  Gameplay  Mark (as Bert) faces one of the game's unconventional bosses: a giant, hopping fried shrimp. Defeating this form turns the monster into an onion ring, which in turn becomes shish kebab. The player takes the role of Mark, who wields his bat to attack and to deflect projectiles. Rebounding projectiles back at bosses is often necessary to defeat them as Mark has limited attack options. Enemies drop hearts, which replenish life, as well as pills which (for a small period of time) turn Mark into Bert, who can fly and shoot beams at a limited distance. The effect of Bert's beams on enemies is stronger than Mark's bat attack, and gradually improves as the player completes levels. Monster Party features eight levels, each of which has a unique password that allows the player to access a particular level without starting the entire game over. The basic objective in each level is to beat particular bosses (and a certain number of them) to earn a key and move on to the next level. Bosses are accessed by doorways found in the main part of the level, which is side-scrolling. However, many of these doors lead to empty rooms, adding challenge. Every door, whether it leads to nothing or a level boss, gives the player a question mark ('?') item, which can either provide the player with health, points, or the transformation into Bert. = Levels = * Dark World: Initially a grassy, mountainous region with blocks bearing smiley faces. After passing a haniwa statute at the midway point, lightning strikes, the faces melt into bloody skulls, and the world becomes a hellish environment. The bosses for this level are a Man-Eating Plant, a giant dead lizard (commonly misinterpreted as a spider, no fighting necessary, as its dialogue box \\"SORRY, I'M DEAD\\" confirms), and a pumpkin- headed ghost who throws smaller pumpkins and wants not to be picked on. * Dark World Dungeon: A sewer-like area infested with fish heads, crocodiles, and a blood-belching creature. Bosses for this level include a Medusa; Shrimp Attack; and a haunted wishing well that throws plates (a reference to the Banch≈ç Sarayashiki ghost story). * Dark World Cave: Bosses for this level include the Guardian of the Giant Sphinx, who complains that his legs are asleep; a Giant Spider; and the Giant Cow Man, whose attack is smaller cows. * Dark World Castle Ruins: A pyramid-like area with desert enemies, such as scorpions. Bosses include Giant Samurai, who is slow-moving and admits it in its dialogue box; a giant cat; and Punk Rocker. * Dark World Lake: This area has two bosses instead of the usual three. Enemies include sharks with large fins and sea serpents. Bosses are The Walking Dead (a pair of invincible, dancing zombies who automatically deteriorate if the player simply watches them perform); and Mad Javelin Man, a large wooden robot. * Dark World Haunted Mansion: A large maze that must be navigated. There is only one boss here, Chameleon Man, a giant, reptilian head that blends into its environment. * Dark World Tower: An upward scrolling tower. Amongst gamers, the level is notorious for a bug that renders the game unwinnable if all three bosses are defeated; the player must only beat two and then proceed to the end of the level in order to beat it. Beating all three bosses will result in the player losing the key. Enemies include umpires, masked elephants, and imps. Bosses include a caterpillar named (Rolls) Royce; the Grim Reaper; and the return of the Giant Spider, with a Roman numeral II on its back. * Dark World Heaven's Gate: A heaven-like area that defies the conventions of platformers by having a \\"hidden\\" area to the left of the starting position. Enemies include dynamite and witches. Bosses are a Pharaoh's Head; Hand Man; and Giant Dragon. After beating the eight levels, the player faces the Dark World Master, seen only as an angry giant zombie face that shoots flying eyeballs. His nose opens into another eye, his only weak spot.  Legacy  The game's title screen as it appears in the US release. Prototype screenshots revealed that the green \\"slime\\" was originally blood. Monster Party is infamous in the retro gaming community for prototype images released in Japan before the game's release in the US. The images reveal a different original concept for the game that was much darker and more graphically complex than the version eventually released. Originally, the title screen was to be covered in blood, and the enemies designed to look much more horrific than in the final game. The first level's setting, presently an abstract black-and-pink pattern, was originally an elaborately drawn mountain range at sunset. Other changes revealed by these images is a change to the first boss, a large plant, which was shown to have a microphone and speaker in the original, a possible reference to Little Shop of Horrors. The game is remembered for its bizarre premise by both fans and critics alike. The horror content that was permitted to remain in the game‚Äînotably large amounts of blood and the use of the word \\"hell\\"‚Äîhave puzzled gamers, as Nintendo was notorious for enforcing censorship policies in the late 1980s and early 90s, when the game was released. In the latter 2000s, following the release of prototype images, gamers realized that an invisible platform inside the man eating plant's chamber was in fact the \\"deleted\\" speaker system, and that programmers had simply covered the sprite in black pixels rather than outright remove it. This led to the establishment of a restoration project, in which gamers began searching through the game's source code in attempt to discover if other \\"deleted\\" content had in fact remained on the cartridge, and reinsert it into a \\"restored\\" version of the game. The project was completed in 2013. Amongst discoveries made by those working on the project was the revelation that many of the game's more incongruous bosses may have originated as copyrighted characters that had to be altered for the game to be released in the United States: The pumpkin ghost with the spinning head was originally an ape from Planet of the Apes, while the giant cat inside of the box seems to have originally been one of the Gremlins, and finally the grim reaper was originally an alien from the Alien franchise.

The film was written by Spade and Fred Wolf, and produced by Robert Simonds.Dirt's character was loosely based on Spade's childhood friend, Ryan Taylor. The plot revolves around a \\"white trash\\" young man, Joe Dirt, who at first seems to be a \\"loser\\", a failure, an antihero. As he travels in search of his parents, his finer qualities are increasingly revealed. He ends up with a new \\"family\\" of close friends, people he has helped and who respect him. Critical reception was mostly negative, but the film was a modest financial success. The film has a cult following. A sequel, Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser, premiered on Crackle on July 16, 2015. Plot Joe Dirt is the janitor at a Los Angeles radio station. A producer drags him into the studio to talk live on the air with a famous disc jockey, shock jock Zander Kelly. Joe tells his life story. As a baby, he had a mullet wig installed because the top of his skull had never formed. At age 8, he was left behind by his parents and sister at the Grand Canyon. He does not know his real surname. After growing up in a series of foster homes and travelling on the road as a kid while camping in the woods, Joe arrived in Silvertown, a small town in the Pacific Northwest, where he met the beautiful Brandy and her dog, Charlie, and became a target for jealousy from Robby, the town bully. After Brandy's alcoholic father shoots Charlie dead, Joe decides to try to find his parents. He strikes up a friendship with Kicking Wing, an unsuccessful Native American fireworks salesman. In Indiana, Joe has an encounter with a skin cannibal named Buffalo Bob. This brings him unwanted attention from the media, but helps his search. He travels to Louisiana and works as a high school janitor with \\"Clem Doore\\", a former NYC mobster in the Witness Protection Program, with whom he becomes good friends. Joe discovers the address of his old family home and travels to Baton Rouge. Listening to Joe's story, both Zander and the radio audience initially find him an object of scorn, but Joe's kindness and optimistic outlook on life, as well as his good-natured self deprecation, win them over. Eventually, Joe lands the janitorial job at the Los Angeles radio station, where he recounts how, after discovering his old home vacant and his parents long gone, he gives up the search and returns to Silvertown to be with Brandy. However, Robby informs him that Brandy found Joe's parents, but instructed Robby not to tell Joe. Robby shows a note from Brandy to prove it. Hearing this, Zander calls Brandy on the phone on air to find out why, with Brandy stating that she wanted to tell Joe in person, but never had the opportunity. Brandy tells Joe his parents were killed the day they were at the Grand Canyon; she pleads with Joe to return to Silvertown. Upset by the news, Joe stays in Los Angeles. Joe is unaware that he has become a media sensation, but he quickly discovers his newfound fame. An appearance on TRL with Carson Daly results in a phone call from a woman claiming to be Joe's mother. Joe realizes that she is indeed his mother and finds his parents' current house, where he and the media discover that his parents intentionally abandoned him at the Grand Canyon, and that they only reconnected with him in order to take advantage of his newfound publicity so they can boost their sales of clown figurines. Angry and sad, Joe storms out, cutting ties with his parents. Joe intends to commit suicide, but Brandy appears and says that she only told him his parents were dead to protect him from their greed. She invites Joe to come home with her, saying he \\"was home all along\\". Before Joe can come down from the ledge, he suffers a head injury in a freak accident when a policeman tries to prevent him from falling using a rope. Joe wakes up in Brandy's house, surrounded by his friends: Brandy, Kicking Wing (who now owns 30 successful firework stands), Clem (now renamed Gert B. Frobe), and Charlene (another friend who is engaged to Doore). Brandy got Joe a new rastafarian dreadlock wig following his head operation. Brandy has retrieved Joe's Hemi, and she has a new dog that Charlie fathered. Robby drives up and tells Joe that no one wants him in Silvertown, no matter how famous he is. Clem threatens Robby, and Charlene insults Robby's car. They all realize that they are like family to Joe. They ride off, leaving a frustrated Robby in the dust, his windshield broken by the stones thrown up by Joe's car. As they drive away, Zander plays a song for Joe on the radio, and fireworks go off in the sky (with special thanks to Kicking Wing).

In particular, the word usually refers to a Japanese word of foreign origin that was not borrowed in ancient times from Old or Middle Chinese, but in modern times, primarily from English or other European languages. These are primarily written in the katakana phonetic script, with a few older terms written in Chinese characters (kanji); the latter are known as ateji. Japanese has many loan words from Chinese, accounting for a sizeable fraction of the language. These words were borrowed during ancient times and are written in kanji. Modern Chinese loanwords are generally considered gairaigo and written in katakana, or sometimes written in kanji (either with the more familiar word as a base text gloss and the intended katakana as furigana or vice versa); pronunciation of modern Chinese loanwords generally differs from the corresponding usual pronunciation of the characters in Japanese. For a list of terms, see the List of gairaigo and wasei-eigo terms.  Source languages  Japanese has a long history of borrowing from foreign languages. It has been doing so since the late fourth century A.D. Some ancient gairaigo words are still being used nowadays, but there are also many kinds of gairaigo words that were borrowed more recently. Most, but not all, modern gairaigo are derived from English, particularly in the post-World War II era (after 1945). Words are taken from English for concepts that do not exist in Japanese, but also for other reasons, such as a preference for English terms or fashionability ‚Äì many gairaigo have Japanese near-synonyms. In the past, more gairaigo came from other languages besides English. The first period of borrowing occurred during the late fourth century A.D., when a massive number of Chinese characters were adopted. This period could be considered as one of the most significant in the history of gairaigo, because it was the first moment when the written communication systems using kanji were formed. The first non-Asian countries to have extensive contact with Japan were Portugal and the Netherlands in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Japanese has several loanwords from Portuguese and Dutch, many of which are still used. The interaction between Japan and Portugal lasted from the late middle age until the early Edo era. (1549-1638). An example of the loanwords from Portuguese is rasha, meaning a thick wool cloth that was indispensable during the period, but not used often nowadays. In the Edo era (1603‚Äì1853), words from the Dutch language, such as glas, gas, and alcohol, started to have an impact in the Japanese language. Also, during the Edo era, many medical words like Gaze (meaning gauze) and neuroses came from German, and many artistic words such as rouge and dessin came from French. Most of the gairaigo since the nineteenth century came from English. In the Meiji era (late 19th to early 20th century), Japan also had extensive contact with Germany, and gained many loanwords from German, particularly for Western medicine, which the Japanese learned from the Germans. Notable examples include (often abbreviated to ) from German (\\"work\\"), and from German Energie. They also gained several loanwords from French at this time. In modern times, there are some borrowings from Modern Chinese and Modern Korean, particularly for food names, and these continue as new foods become popular in Japan; standard examples include ≈´ron (ÁÉèÈæç „Ç¶„Éº„É≠„É≥ \\"oolong tea\\") and kimuchi („Ç≠„É†„ÉÅ \\"kimchi\\"), respectively, while more specialized examples include hoik≈çr≈ç (ÂõûÈçãËÇâ „Éõ„Ç§„Ç≥„Éº„É≠„Éº \\"twice cooked pork\\") from Chinese, and bibinba („Éì„Éì„É≥„Éê \\"bibimbap\\") from Korean. Chinese words are often represented with Chinese characters, but with katakana gloss to indicate the unusual pronunciation, while Korean words, which no longer regularly use Chinese characters (hanja), are represented in katakana. There is sometimes ambiguity in pronunciation of these borrowings, particularly voicing, such as to („Éà) vs. do („Éâ) ‚Äì compare English's Daoism‚ÄìTaoism romanization issue. Some Modern Chinese borrowings occurred during the 17th and 18th centuries, due both to trade and resident Chinese in Nagasaki, and a more recent wave of Buddhist monks, the ≈åbaku school, whose words are derived from languages spoken in Fujian. More recent Korean borrowings are influenced both by proximity, and to the substantial population of Koreans in Japan since the early 20th century. In 1889, there were 85 gairaigo of Dutch origin and 72 gairaigo of English origin listed in a Japanese dictionary. From 1911 to 1924, 51% of gairaigo listed in dictionaries were of English origin, and today, 80% to 90% of gairaigo are of English origin. There have been some borrowings from Sanskrit as well, most notably for religious terms. These words are generally transliterations which were unknowingly borrowed from Chinese.\\"Sanskrit Names And Their Japanese Equivalents\\" = Cognates = In some cases, cognates or etymologically related words from different languages may be borrowed and sometimes used synonymously or sometimes used distinctly. The most common basic example is versus earlier , where they are used distinctly. A similar example is versus earlier ; thus is not redundant but means a drinking vessel specifically made of glass (e.g. as opposed to plastic). A more technical example is (English sorbitol) versus (German Sorbit), used synonymously. = Wasei-kango = In addition to borrowings, which adopted both meaning and pronunciation, Japanese also has an extensive set of new words that are crafted using existing Chinese morphemes to express a foreign term. These are known as wasei-kango \\"Japanese- made Chinese words\\". This process is similar to the creation of classical compounds in European languages. Many were coined in the Meiji period, and these are very common in medical terminology. These are not considered gairaigo, as the foreign word itself has not been borrowed, and sometimes a translation and a borrowing are both used.  Writing  In written Japanese, gairaigo are usually written in katakana. Older loanwords are also often written using ateji (kanji chosen for their phonetic value, or sometimes for meaning instead) or hiragana, for example tabaco from Portuguese, meaning \\"tobacco\\" or \\"cigarette\\" can be written (katakana), (hiragana), or (the kanji for \\"smoke grass\\", but still pronounced \\"tabako\\" ‚Äì meaning-ateji), with no change in meaning. Another common older example is tempura, which is usually written in mixed kanji/kana (mazegaki) as , but is also written as (rare kanji) or (common kanji) ‚Äì here it is sound-ateji, with the characters used for sound value only. Few gairaigo are sometimes written with a single kanji character (chosen for meaning or newly created); consequently, these are considered kun'yomi rather than ateji because the single characters are used for meaning rather than for sound and are often written as katakana. An example is ; see single-character loan words for details. False friends and wasei-eigo There are numerous causes for confusion in gairaigo: (1) gairaigo are often abbreviated, (2) their meaning may change (either in Japanese or in the original language after the borrowing has occurred), (3) many words are not borrowed but rather coined in Japanese (wasei-eigo \\"English made in Japan\\"), and (4) not all gairaigo come from English. Due to Japanese pronunciation rules and its mora-based phonology, many words take a significant amount of time to pronounce. For example, a one-syllable word in a language such as English (brake) often becomes several syllables when pronounced in Japanese (in this case, burƒìki (), which amounts to four moras). The Japanese language, therefore, contains many abbreviated and contracted words, and there is a strong tendency to shorten words. This also occurs with gairaigo words. For example, \\"remote control\\", when transcribed in Japanese, becomes rim≈çto kontor≈çru (), but this has then been simplified to rimokon (). For another example, the transcribed word for \\"department store\\" is depƒÅtomento sutoa () but has since been shortened to depƒÅto (). Clipped compounds, such as wƒÅpuro () for \\"word processor\\", are common. Karaoke (), a combination of the Japanese word kara \\"empty\\" and the clipped form, oke, of the English loanword \\"orchestra\\" (J. ≈çkesutora ), is a clipped compound that has entered the English language. Japanese ordinarily takes the first part of a foreign word, but in some cases the second syllable is used instead; notable examples from English include and . Some Japanese people are not aware of the origins of the words in their language, and may assume that all gairaigo words are legitimate English words. For example, Japanese people may use words like tƒìma (, from German Thema, meaning \\"topic/theme\\") in English, or rimokon, not realizing that the contraction of \\"remote control\\" to rimokon took place in Japan. Similarly, gairaigo, while making Japanese easier to learn for foreign students in some cases, can also cause problems due to independent semantic progression. For example, English \\"stove\\", from which sut≈çbu () is derived, has multiple meanings. Americans often use the word to mean a cooking appliance, and are thus surprised when Japanese take it to mean a space heater (such as a wood-burning stove). The Japanese term for a cooking stove is another gairaigo term, renji (), from the English \\"range\\"; a gas stove is a gasurenji (). Additionally, Japanese combines words in ways that are uncommon in English. As an example, left over is a baseball term for a hit that goes over the left-fielder's head rather than uneaten food saved for a later meal. This is a term that appears to be a loan but is actually wasei-eigo. It is sometimes difficult for students of Japanese to distinguish among gairaigo, giseigo (onomatopoeia), and gitaigo (ideophones: words that represent the manner of an action, like \\"zigzag\\" in English ‚Äî jiguzagu in Japanese), which are also written in katakana. Wasei-eigo presents more difficulties for Japanese and learners of Japanese as such words, once entered the lexicon, combine to form any number of potentially confusing combinations. For example, the loanwords chance, pink, erotic, over, down, up, in, my, and boom have all entered wasei-eigo lexicon, combining with Japanese words and other English loanwords to produce any number of combination words and phrases. 'Up,' or appu, is famously combined with other words to convey an increase, such as seiseki appu (increased results) and raifu appu (improved quality of life). 'My,\\" or mai, also regularly appears in advertisements for any number and genre of items. From \\"My Fanny\\" toilet paper to \\"My Hand\\" electric hand drills, mai serves as a common advertising tool. Infamously, the beverage brand Calpis sold a product regrettably named mai pisu or 'my piss' for a short time. Wasei-eigo is often employed to disguise or advertise risque or sexual terms and innuendos, especially when used by women. Wasei-eigo terms referencing a person's characteristics, personality, and habits also commonly appear as Japanese street slang, from poteto chippusu or 'potato chips' for a hick and esu efu 'SF' for a 'sex friend.' Grammatical function Gairaigo are generally nouns, which can be subsequently used as verbs by adding auxiliary verb . For example, \\"play soccer\\" is translated as „Çµ„ÉÉ„Ç´„Éº„Çí„Åô„Çã (sakkƒÅ o suru). Some exceptions exist, such as , which conjugates as a normal Japanese verb ‚Äì note the unusual use of katakana () followed by hiragana (). Another example is gugu-ru („Ç∞„Ç∞„Çã, \\"to google\\"), which conjugates as a normal Japanese verb, in which the final syllable is converted into okurigana to enable conjugation. Gairaigo function as do morphemes from other sources, and, in addition to wasei eigo (words or phrases from combining gairaigo), gairaigo can combine with morphemes of Japanese or Chinese origin in words and phrases, as in (compare ), (compare ) or . In set phrases, there is sometimes a preference to use all gairaigo (in katakana) or all kango/wago (in kanji), as in (mansurii manshon, monthly apartment) versus (tsukigime ch≈´shaj≈ç, monthly parking lot), but mixed phrases are common, and may be used interchangeably, as in (tenanto bosh≈´) and (ny≈´kyosha bosh≈´), both meaning \\"looking for a tenant\\". Phonology Borrowings traditionally have had pronunciations that conform to Japanese phonology and phonotactics. For example, platform was borrowed as /h≈çmu/, because */fo/ is not a sound combination that traditionally occurs in Japanese. However, in recent years, some gairaigo are pronounced more closely to their original sound, which is represented by non- traditional combinations of katakana, generally using small katakana or diacritics (voicing marks) to indicate these non-traditional sounds. Compare and sumaho („Çπ„Éû„Éõ, \\"smart phone\\"), where traditional sounds are used, and , a variant of the latter word using traditional sounds, where the non-traditional combination (fu-o) is used to represent the non-traditional sound combination /fo/. This leads to long words; e.g., the word for \\"fanfare\\" is spelled out as , with seven kana, no shorter than the Roman alphabet original (it is possible that it was not loaned from English because the \\"e\\" is not silent). Similarly, Japanese traditionally does not have any /v/ phoneme, instead approximating it with /b/, but today /v/ (normally realized not as [v] but as bilabial [Œ≤]) is sometimes used in pronunciations: for example, \\"violin\\" can be pronounced either or , with (literally \\"voiced u\\"+\\"a\\") representing /va/. Another example of the Japanese transformation of English pronunciation is , in which the two- syllable word taxi becomes three syllables (and four morae, thanks to long ƒ´) because consonants don't occur consecutively in traditional Japanese (with the exception of the coda „Çì/„É≥ or /n/), and in which the sound [si] (\\"see\\") of English is pronounced […ïi] (which to monoglot English speakers will sound like \\"she\\") because /si/ in Japanese is realized as such. This change in Japanese phonology following the introduction of foreign words (here primarily from English) can be compared to the earlier posited change in Japanese phonology following the introduction of Chinese loanwords, such as closed syllables (CVC, not just CV) and length becoming a phonetic feature with the development of both long vowels and long consonants ‚Äì see Early Middle Japanese: Phonological developments. Due to the difficulties that Japanese have in distinguishing \\"l\\" and \\"r\\", this expansion of Japanese phonology has not extended to inventing different kana for /l/ vs. /r/. Therefore, words with /l/ or /r/ may be spelled identically if borrowed into Japanese. One important exception is due to the fact that Japanese typically borrows English words in a non-rhotic fashion, so that syllable-final \\"-r\\" and \\"-l\\" can still be distinguished. For example, \\"bell\\" is „Éô„É´ and \\"bear\\" is „Éô„Ç¢, rather than both being „Éô„É´. As a built-in lexicon of English The English words that are borrowed into Japanese include many of the most useful English words, including high-frequency vocabulary and academic vocabulary. Thus gairaigo may constitute a useful built-in lexicon for Japanese learners of English. Gairaigo have been observed to aid a Japanese child's learning of ESL vocabulary. With adults, gairaigo assist in English-word aural recognition and pronunciation, spelling, listening comprehension, retention of spoken and written English, and recognition and recall at especially higher levels of vocabulary. Moreover, in their written production, students of Japanese prefer using English words that have become gairaigo to those that have not.Japanese Loanwords & English Vocabulary Acquisition Misconceptions The word arigat≈ç (Japanese for \\"thank you\\") sounds similar to the Portuguese word obrigado, which has the same meaning. Given the number of borrowings from Portuguese, it may seem reasonable to suppose that the Japanese imported that wordwhich is the explanation accepted and indeed published by many. However, arigat≈ç is not a gairaigo; rather, it is an abbreviation of arigat≈ç gozaimasu, which consists of an inflection of the native Japanese adjective arigatai () combined with the polite verb gozaimasu.arigat≈ç There is evidence, for example in the Man'y≈çsh≈´, that the word arigatai was in use several centuries before contact with the Portuguese. This makes the two terms false cognates. If the Portuguese word had been borrowed, it would most likely have taken the form „Ç™„Éñ„É™„Ç¨„Éâ (oburigado), or maybe ≈çrigado (due to historical afu and ofu collapsing to ≈ç), and while it is even possible that it would be spelled with as ateji, it would regardless start with o rather than a, and the final o would have been short rather than long. Reborrowings from Japanese Some gairaigo words have been reborrowed into their original source languages, particularly in the jargon of fans of Japanese entertainment. For example, anime () is gairaigo derived from the English word for \\"animation\\", but has been reborrowed by English with the meaning of \\"Japanese animation\\". Similarly, puroresu () derives from \\"professional wrestling\\", and has been adopted by English-speaking wrestling fans as a term for the style of pro wrestling performed in Japan. Kosupure (), or cosplay, was formed from the English words \\"costume play\\", referring to dressing in costumes such as those of anime, manga, or videogame characters, and is now used with enthusiasm in English and other languages (also using Western cartoon realms). There are also rare examples of borrowings from Indo-European languages, which have subsequently been borrowed by other Indo-European languages, thus yielding distant cognates. An example is , originally borrowed from Russian –∏–∫—Ä–∞ (ikra), and possibly distantly cognate (from the same Indo-European root) to English \\"roe\\" (fish eggs), though the only indication is the shared \\"r\\".

It is one of the fastest growing plants and was one of the first plants to be spun into usable fiber 50,000 years ago. It can be refined into a variety of commercial items, including paper, textiles, clothing, biodegradable plastics, paint, insulation, biofuel, food, and animal feed. Although cannabis as a drug and industrial hemp both derive from the species Cannabis sativa and contain the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), they are distinct strains with unique phytochemical compositions and uses. Hemp has lower concentrations of THC and higher concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD), which decreases or eliminates its psychoactive effects. The legality of industrial hemp varies widely between countries. Some governments regulate the concentration of THC and permit only hemp that is bred with an especially low THC content. Etymology The etymology is uncertain but there appears to be no common Proto-Indo-European source for the various forms of the word; the Greek term () is the oldest attested form, which may have been borrowed from an earlier Scythian or Thracian word. Then it appears to have been borrowed into Latin, and separately into Slavic and from there into Baltic, Finnish, and Germanic languages. In the Germanic languages, following Grimm's law, the \\"k\\" would have changed to \\"h\\" with the first Germanic sound shift, giving Proto-Germanic *hanapiz, after which it may have been adapted into the Old English form, , . Barber (1991) however, argued that the spread of the name \\"kannabis\\" was due to its historically more recent plant use, starting from the south, around Iran, whereas non-THC varieties of hemp are older and prehistoric. Another possible source of origin is Assyrian , which was the name for a source of oil, fiber, and medicine in the 1st millennium BC. Cognates of hemp in other Germanic languages include Dutch , Danish and Norwegian , Saterland Frisian , German , Icelandic and Swedish . In those languages \\"hemp\\" can refer to either industrial fiber hemp or narcotic cannabis strains. Uses Hemp seed Hemp is used to make a variety of commercial and industrial products, including rope, textiles, clothing, shoes, food, paper, bioplastics, insulation, and biofuel. The bast fibers can be used to make textiles that are 100% hemp, but they are commonly blended with other fibers, such as flax, cotton or silk, as well as virgin and recycled polyester, to make woven fabrics for apparel and furnishings. The inner two fibers of the plant are woodier and typically have industrial applications, such as mulch, animal bedding, and litter. When oxidized (often erroneously referred to as \\"drying\\"), hemp oil from the seeds becomes solid and can be used in the manufacture of oil-based paints, in creams as a moisturizing agent, for cooking, and in plastics. Hemp seeds have been used in bird feed mix as well. A survey in 2003 showed that more than 95% of hemp seed sold in the European Union was used in animal and bird feed. =Food= macro image of hemp seeds Hemp seeds are high in complete protein and a great source of iron. They can be eaten raw, ground into hemp meal, sprouted or made into dried sprout powder. Hemp seeds can also be made into a liquid and used for baking or for beverages such as hemp milk and tisanes. Hemp oil is cold- pressed from the seed and is high in unsaturated fatty acids. The leaves of the hemp plant, while not as nutritional as the seeds, are edible and can be consumed raw as leafy vegetables in salads, and pressed to make juice. In 2011, the US imported $11.5 million worth of hemp products, mostly driven by growth in the demand for hemp seed and hemp oil for use as ingredients in foods such as granola. In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs treats hemp as a purely non-food crop, but with proper licensing and proof of less than 0.2% THC concentration, hemp seeds can be imported for sowing or for sale as a food or food ingredient. In the US, hemp can be used legally in food products and, , was typically sold in health food stores or through mail order. File:HempSeed.jpgWhole hemp seeds File:Konopne seminko loupane.jpgHulled hemp seeds Nutrition A 100-gram portion of hulled hemp seeds supplies 586 calories. They contain 5% water, 5% carbohydrates, 49% total fat, and 31% protein. Hemp seeds are notable in providing 64% of the Daily Value (DV) of protein per 100-gram serving. Hemp seeds are a rich source of dietary fiber (20% DV), B vitamins, and the dietary minerals manganese (362% DV), phosphorus (236% DV), magnesium (197% DV), zinc (104% DV), and iron (61% DV). About 73% of the energy in hemp seeds is in the form of fats and essential fatty acids, mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic, oleic, and alpha-linolenic acids. The ratio of the 38.100 grams of polyunsaturated fats per 100 grams is 9.301 grams of omega‚Äë3 to 28.698 grams of omega‚Äë6. Typically, the portion suggested on packages for an adult is 30 grams, approximately three tablespoons. Hemp seeds' amino acid profile is comparable to other sources of protein such as meat, milk, eggs, and soy. Protein digestibility-corrected amino acid scores (PDCAAS), which attempt to measure the degree to which a food for humans is a \\"complete protein\\", were 0.49‚Äì0.53 for whole hemp seed, 0.46‚Äì0.51 for hemp seed meal, and 0.63‚Äì0.66 for hulled hemp seed. Storage Hemp oil oxidizes and turns rancid within a short period of time if not stored properly; its shelf life is extended when it is stored in a dark airtight container and refrigerated. Both light and heat can degrade hemp oil. =Fiber= Hemp fiber has been used extensively throughout history, with production climaxing soon after being introduced to the New World. For centuries, items ranging from rope, to fabrics, to industrial materials were made from hemp fiber. Hemp was also commonly used to make sail canvas. The word \\"canvas\\" is derived from the word cannabis. Pure hemp has a texture similar to linen. Because of its versatility for use in a variety of products, today hemp is used in a number of consumer goods, including clothing, shoes, accessories, dog collars, and home wares. For clothing, in some instances, hemp is mixed with lyocell.

Such blocks are not strong enough to be used for structural elements; they must be supported by a brick, wood, or steel frame.NNFCC. \\"NNFCC Project Factsheet: Guide to Building with Hemp-Lime Composites, NNFCC 07-001\\", \\"National Non-Food Crops Centre\\", Retrieved on 16 February 2011 However, hemp fibres have been shown to be usable as a replacement for wood for many jobs, including creating durable and breathable homes. The most common use of hemp lime in building is by casting the hemp and lime mix while wet around a timber frame with temporary shuttering, and tamping the mix to form a firm mass; after the removal of the temporary shuttering, the solidified hemp mix is then ready to be plastered with a lime plaster. The first example of the use of hempcrete was in 1986 in France with the renovation of the Maison de la Turquie in Nogent-sur-Seine by the innovator Charles Rasetti. In the UK hemp lime was first used in 2000 for the construction of two test dwellings in Haverhill. Designed by Modece Architects, who pioneered hemp's use in UK construction, the hemp houses were monitored in comparison with other standard dwellings by BRE. Completed in 2009, the Renewable House is one of the most technologically advanced made from hemp-based materials. The first US home made of hemp-based materials was completed in August 2010 in Asheville, North Carolina. A panellized system of hemp-lime panels for use in building construction is currently under test in a European Union-funded research collaboration led by the University of Bath. The panels are being designed to assure high-quality construction, rapid on- site erection, optimal hygrothermal performance from day one, and energy- and resource-efficient buildings. The 36-month work program aims to refine product and manufacturing protocols and produce data for certification and marketing, warranty, insurance cover, and availability of finance. It also includes the development of markets in Britain, France, and Spain. Hemp is used as an internal plaster and is a mixture of hemp hurd (shive) mixed with larger proportions of a lime-based binder. Hemp plaster has insulative qualities.Allin, Steve.

The choice of which bast fiber to use is primarily based on cost and availability. Various car makers are beginning to use hemp in their cars, including Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Chrysler, Honda, Iveco, Lotus, Mercedes, Mitsubishi, Porsche, Saturn, Volkswagen and Volvo. For example, the Lotus Eco Elise and the Mercedes C-Class both contain hemp (up to 20 kg in each car in the case of the latter).

The products are mainly specialty papers such as cigarette paper, banknotes and technical filter papers. Compared to wood pulp, hemp pulp offers a four to five times longer fibre, a significantly lower lignin fraction as well as a higher tear resistance and tensile strength. However, production costs are about four times higher than for paper from wood, since the infrastructure for using hemp is underdeveloped. If the paper industry were to switch from wood to hemp for sourcing its cellulose fibers, the following benefits could be utilized: * Hemp yields three to four times more usable fibre per hectare per annum than forests, and hemp doesn't need pesticides or herbicides. * Hemp has a much faster crop yield. It takes about 3-4 months for hemp stalks to reach maturity, while trees can take between 20 to 80 years. Not only does hemp grow at a faster rate, but it also contains a high level of cellulose. This quick return means that paper can be produced at a faster rate if hemp were used in place of wood. * Hemp paper does not require the use of toxic bleaching or as many chemicals as wood pulp because it can be whitened with hydrogen peroxide. This means using hemp instead of wood for paper would end the practice of poisoning Earth's waterways with chlorine or dioxins from wood paper manufacturing. * Hemp paper can be recycled up to 8 times, compared to just 3 times for paper made from wood pulp. * Compared to its wood pulp counterpart, paper from hemp fibers resists decomposition and does not yellow or brown with age. It is also one of the strongest natural fibers in the world \\\\- one of the reasons for its longevity and durability. * Several factors favor the increased use of wood substitutes for paper, especially agricultural fibers such as hemp. Deforestation, particularly the destruction of old growth forests, and the world‚Äôs decreasing supply of wild timber resources are today major ecological concerns. Hemp's use as a wood substitute will contribute to preserving biodiversity. However, hemp has had a hard time competing with paper from trees or recycled newsprint. Only the outer part of the stem consists mainly of fibers which are suitable for the production of paper. Numerous attempts have been made to develop machines that efficiently and inexpensively separate useful fibers from less useful fibers, but none have been completely successful. This has meant that paper from hemp is still expensive compared to paper from trees. =Jewelry= Hemp and bead jewelry Hemp jewelry is the product of knotting hemp twine through the practice of macram√©. Hemp jewellery includes bracelets, necklaces, anklets, rings, watches, and other adornments. Some jewellery features beads made from crystals, glass, stone, wood and bones. The hemp twine varies in thickness and comes in a variety of colors. There are many different stitches used to create hemp jewellery, however, the half knot and full knot stitches are most common. =Cordage= Hemp rope Hemp rope was used in the age of sailing ships, though the rope had to be protected by tarring, since hemp rope has a propensity for breaking from rot, as the capillary effect of the rope-woven fibers tended to hold liquid at the interior, while seeming dry from the outside. Tarring was a labor-intensive process, and earned sailors the nickname \\"Jack Tar\\". Hemp rope was phased out when manila rope, which does not require tarring, became widely available. Manila is sometimes referred to as Manila hemp, but is not related to hemp; it is abac√°, a species of banana. =Animal bedding= Hemp straw animal bedding Hemp shives are the core of the stem, hemp hurds are broken parts of the core. In the EU, they are used for animal bedding (horses, for instance), or for horticultural mulch.NNFCC. In the US, pet manufacturers use hemp in dog and cat bedding. \\"Crop Factsheet: Hemp\\" , National Non-Food Crops Centre, 9 June 2008. Retrieved on 6 May 2009 Industrial hemp is much more profitable if both fibers and shives (or even seeds) can be used. =Water and soil purification= Hemp can be used as a \\"mop crop\\" to clear impurities out of wastewater, such as sewage effluent, excessive phosphorus from chicken litter, or other unwanted substances or chemicals. Additionally, hemp is being used to clean contaminants at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site, by way of a process which is known as phytoremediation‚Äîthe process of clearing radioisotopes and a variety of other toxins from the soil, water, and air. =Weed control= Hemp crops are tall, have thick foliage, and can be planted densely, and thus can be grown as a smother crop to kill tough weeds. Using hemp this way can help farmers avoid the use of herbicides, gain organic certification, and gain the benefits of crop rotation. However, due to the plant's rapid and dense growth characteristics, some jurisdictions consider hemp a prohibited and noxious weed, much like Scotch Broom. File:Hanflabyrinth Berlin 2009 - 40.jpgThe dense growth of hemp helps kill weeds, even thistle. =Biofuels= Biodiesel sample Biodiesel can be made from the oils in hemp seeds and stalks; this product is sometimes called \\"hempoline\\". Alcohol fuel (ethanol or, less commonly, methanol) can be made by fermenting the whole plant. Filtered hemp oil can be used directly to power diesel engines. In 1892, Rudolf Diesel invented the diesel engine, which he intended to power \\"by a variety of fuels, especially vegetable and seed oils, which earlier were used for oil lamps, i.e. the Argand lamp.\\" Production of vehicle fuel from hemp is very small. Commercial biodiesel and biogas is typically produced from cereals, coconuts, palm seeds, and cheaper raw materials like garbage, wastewater, dead plant and animal material, animal feces and kitchen waste. Processing Separation of hurd and bast fiber is known as decortication. Traditionally, hemp stalks would be water-retted first before the fibers were beaten off the inner hurd by hand, a process known as scutching. As mechanical technology evolved, separating the fiber from the core was accomplished by crushing rollers and brush rollers, or by hammer-milling, wherein a mechanical hammer mechanism beats the hemp against a screen until hurd, smaller bast fibers, and dust fall through the screen. After the Marijuana Tax Act was implemented in 1938, the technology for separating the fibers from the core remained \\"frozen in time\\". Recently, new high-speed kinematic decortication has come about, capable of separating hemp into three streams; bast fiber, hurd, and green microfiber. Only in 1997, did Ireland, parts of the Commonwealth and other countries begin to legally grow industrial hemp again. Iterations of the 1930s decorticator have been met with limited success, along with steam explosion and chemical processing known as thermomechanical pulping. Cultivation The variety of appearances for cannabis. Only C. sativa (left) is suited for industrial hemp, but it also has medicinal varieties. Hemp is usually planted between March and May in the northern hemisphere, between September and November in the southern hemisphere.What Farmers Need to Know About Growing Hemp(https://www.agriculture.com)date=22 July 2019 }} It matures in about three to four months. Millennia of selective breeding have resulted in varieties that display a wide range of traits; e.g. suited for a particular environments/latitudes, producing different ratios and compositions of terpenoids and cannabinoids (CBD, THC, CBG, CBC, CBN...etc.), fibre quality, oil/seed yield, etc. Hemp grown for fiber is planted closely, resulting in tall, slender plants with long fibers. The use of industrial hemp plant and its cultivation was commonplace until the 1900s when it was associated with its genetic sibling a.k.a. Drug-Type Cannabis species (which contain higher levels of psychoactive THC). Influential groups misconstrued hemp as a dangerous \\"drug\\", even though hemp is not a recreational drug and has the potential to be a sustainable and profitable crop for many farmers due to hemp's medical, structural and dietary uses. In the United States, the public's perception of hemp as marijuana has blocked hemp from becoming a useful crop and product,\\"This paper begins with a history of hemp use and then describes how hemp was constructed as a dangerous crop in the U.S. The paper then discusses the potential of hemp as an alternative crop. in spite of its vital importance prior to World War II. Ideally, according to Britain's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the herb should be desiccated and harvested towards the end of flowering. This early cropping reduces the seed yield but improves the fiber yield and quality. In these strains of industrial hemp* the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content would have been very low. The seeds are sown with grain drills or other conventional seeding equipment to a depth of . Greater seeding depths result in increased weed competition. Nitrogen should not be placed with the seed, but phosphate may be tolerated. The soil should have available 89 to 135 kg/ha of nitrogen, 46 kg/ha phosphorus, 67 kg/ha potassium, and 17 kg/ha sulfur. Organic fertilizers such as manure are one of the best methods of weed control. =Cultivars= In contrast to cannabis for medical use, varieties grown for fiber and seed have less than 0.3% THC and are unsuitable for producing hashish and marijuana. Present in industrial hemp, cannabidiol is a major constituent among some 560 compounds found in hemp. Cannabis sativa L. subsp. sativa var. sativa is the variety grown for industrial use, while C. sativa subsp. indica generally has poor fiber quality and female buds from this variety are primarily used for recreational and medicinal purposes. The major differences between the two types of plants are the appearance, and the amount of Œî9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) secreted in a resinous mixture by epidermal hairs called glandular trichomes, although they can also be distinguished genetically. Oilseed and fiber varieties of Cannabis approved for industrial hemp production produce only minute amounts of this psychoactive drug, not enough for any physical or psychological effects. Typically, hemp contains below 0.3% THC, while cultivars of Cannabis grown for medicinal or recreational use can contain anywhere from 2% to over 20%.Hemp and Marijuana: Myths & Realities written by David P.

The plants are cut at 2 to 3 cm above the soil and left on the ground to dry. Mechanical harvesting is now common, using specially adapted cutter-binders or simpler cutters. The cut hemp is laid in swathes to dry for up to four days. This was traditionally followed by retting, either water retting (the bundled hemp floats in water) or dew retting (the hemp remains on the ground and is affected by the moisture in dew and by molds and bacterial action). File:Nutzhanf - getrennte Ernte.webmHarvesting industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa) - This is a separate harvest for a different form of processing: The upper part of the plant with the leaves will be collected for cold pressing, while the lower part remains for producing fiber and initially it is left on the field.

Waterlogged acidic, compressed or extremely light (sandy) soils primarily affect the early development of plants. Steep and high altitudes of more than 400 m above sea level are best avoided. Hemp is relatively insensitive to cold temperatures and can withstand frost down to ‚àí5 ¬∞C. Seeds can germinate down to 1‚Äì3 ¬∞C. Hemp needs a lot of heat, so earlier varieties come to maturation. The water requirement is 300‚Äì500 l/kg dry matter. This is around 1/14th that of cotton, which takes between 7,000 and 29,000 l/kg, according to WWF. Roots can grow up to 3 feet into the soil and use water from deeper soil layers. Hemp benefits crops grown after it. So, it is generally grown before winter cereals. Advantageous changes are high weed suppression, soil loosening by the large hemp root system, and the positive effect on soil tilth. Since hemp is very self-compatible, it can also be grown several years in a row in the same fields (monoculture). = Pests = Several arthropods can cause damage or injury to hemp plants, but the most serious species are associated with the Insecta class. The most problematic for outdoor crops are the voracious stem-boring caterpillars, which include the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, and the Eurasian hemp borer, Grapholita delineana. As the names imply, they target the stems reducing the structural integrity of the plant. Another lepidopteran, the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea, is known to damage flowering parts and can be challenging to control. Other foliar pests, found in both indoor and outdoor crops, include the hemp russet mite, Aculops cannibicola, and cannabis aphid, Phorodon cannabis. They cause injury by reducing plant vigour because they feed on the phloem of the plant. Root feeders can be difficult to detect and control because of their below surface habitat. A number of beetle grubs and chafers are known to cause damage to hemp roots, including the flea beetle and Japanese beetle, Popillia Japonica. The rice root aphid, Rhopalosiphum rufiabdominale, has also been reported but primarily affects indoor growing facilities. Integrated pest management strategies should be employed to manage these pests with prevention and early detection being the foundation of a resilient program. Cultural and physical controls should be employed in conjunction with biological pest controls, chemical applications should only be used as a last resort. =Diseases= Hemp plants can be vulnerable to various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, nematodes, viruses and other miscellaneous pathogens. Such diseases often lead to reduced fiber quality, stunted growth, and death of the plant. These diseases rarely affect the yield of a hemp field, so hemp production is not traditionally dependent on the use of pesticides. =Environmental impact= Hemp is considered by a 1998 study in Environmental Economics to be environmentally friendly due to a decrease of land use and other environmental impacts, indicating a possible decrease of ecological footprint in a US context compared to typical benchmarks. A 2010 study, however, that compared the production of paper specifically from hemp and eucalyptus concluded that \\"industrial hemp presents higher environmental impacts than eucalyptus paper\\"; however, the article also highlights that \\"there is scope for improving industrial hemp paper production\\". Hemp is also claimed to require few pesticides and no herbicides, and it has been called a carbon negative raw material. Results indicate that high yield of hemp may require high total nutrient levels (field plus fertilizer nutrients) similar to a high yielding wheat crop. Producers The world-leading producer of hemp is China, which produces more than 70% of the world output. France ranks second with about a quarter of the world production. Smaller production occurs in the rest of Europe, Chile, and North Korea. Over 30 countries produce industrial hemp, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Ukraine. The United Kingdom and Germany resumed commercial production in the 1990s. British production is mostly used as bedding for horses; other uses are under development. Companies in Canada, the UK, the United States, and Germany, among many others, process hemp seed into a growing range of food products and cosmetics; many traditional growing countries continue to produce textile- grade fibre. Dried hemp stalks displayed at the International Hemp Fair in Vienna Air-dried stem yields in Ontario have from 1998 and onward ranged from 2.6‚Äì14.0 tonnes of dry, retted stalks per hectare (1‚Äì5.5 t/ac) at 12% moisture. Yields in Kent County, have averaged 8.75 t/ha (3.5 t/ac). Northern Ontario crops averaged 6.1 t/ha (2.5 t/ac) in 1998. Statistic for the European Union for 2008 to 2010 say that the average yield of hemp straw has varied between 6.3 and 7.3 ton per ha. Only a part of that is bast fiber. Around one tonne of bast fiber and 2‚Äì3 tonnes of core material can be decorticated from 3‚Äì4 tonnes of good-quality, dry-retted straw. For an annual yield of this level is it in Ontario recommended to add nitrogen (N):70‚Äì110 kg/ha, phosphate (P2O5): up to 80 kg/ha and potash (K2O): 40‚Äì90 kg/ha. The average yield of dry hemp stalks in Europe was 6 ton/ha (2.4 ton/ac) in 2001 and 2002. FAO argue that an optimum yield of hemp fiber is more than 2 tonnes per ha, while average yields are around 650 kg/ha. =Australia= In the Australian states of Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales, and most recently, South Australia, the state governments have issued licences to grow hemp for industrial use. The first to initiate modern research into the potential of cannabis was the state of Tasmania, which pioneered the licensing of hemp during the early 1990s. The state of Victoria was an early adopter in 1998, and has reissued the regulation in 2008. Queensland has allowed industrial production under licence since 2002, where the issuance is controlled under the Drugs Misuse Act 1986. Western Australia enabled the cultivation, harvest and processing of hemp under its Industrial Hemp Act 2004, New South Wales now issues licences under a law, the Hemp Industry Regulations Act 2008 (No 58), that came into effect as of 6 November 2008. Most recently, South Australia legalized industrial hemp under South Australia's Industrial Hemp Act 2017, which commenced on 12 November 2017. =Canada= Commercial production (including cultivation) of industrial hemp has been permitted in Canada since 1998 under licenses and authorization issued by Health Canada (9,725 ha in 2004, 5450 ha in 2009). In the early 1990s, industrial hemp agriculture in North America began with the Hemp Awareness Committee at the University of Manitoba. The Committee worked with the provincial government to get research and development assistance and was able to obtain test plot permits from the Canadian government. Their efforts led to the legalization of industrial hemp (hemp with only minute amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol) in Canada and the first harvest in 1998. In 2017, the cultivated area for hemp in the Prairie provinces include Saskatchewan with more than , Alberta with , and Manitoba with . Canadian hemp is cultivated mostly for its food value as hulled hemp seeds, hemp oils, and hemp protein powders, with only a small fraction devoted to production of hemp fiber used for construction and insulation. =France= France is Europe's biggest producer (and the world's second largest producer) with cultivated. 70‚Äì80% of the hemp fibre produced in 2003 was used for specialty pulp for cigarette papers and technical applications. About 15% was used in the automotive sector, and 5-6% was used for insulation mats. About 95% of hurds were used as animal bedding, while almost 5% was used in the building sector. In 2010/2011, a total of was cultivated with hemp in the EU, a decline compared with previous year.Jordbruksverket: 2.1‚Äì2.3, 2.5 Marknadssituationen f√∂r spannm√•l, oljev√§xter, proteingr√∂dor, ris,2011-03-10, (Swedish Board of Agriculture, Report from an expert group in the European Union about the market situation for a number of agricultural products.

The main production areas were in Ukraine, the Kursk and Orel regions of Russia, and near the Polish border. Since its inception in 1931, the Hemp Breeding Department at the Institute of Bast Crops in Hlukhiv (Glukhov), Ukraine, has been one of the world's largest centers for developing new hemp varieties, focusing on improving fiber quality, per-hectare yields, and low THC content.Hemp will help Ukraine to grow wealthy Interview with Dr. V. G. Virovets, the head of the Hemp Breeding Department at the Institute of Bast Crops (1998) After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the commercial cultivation of hemp declined sharply. However, at least an estimated 2.5 million acres of hemp grow wild in the Russian Far East and the Black Sea regions. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, cultivation licences are issued by the Home Office under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. When grown for nondrug purposes, hemp is referred to as industrial hemp, and a common product is fibre for use in a wide variety of products, as well as the seed for nutritional aspects and the oil. Feral hemp or ditch weed is usually a naturalized fibre or oilseed strain of Cannabis that has escaped from cultivation and is self-seeding. =United States= As of December 2018, hemp is legal to grow in the United States under federal law. The Hemp Farming Act was included in the 2018 Farm Bill. The bill changed hemp from a controlled substance to an agricultural commodity, legalizing hemp federally, which made it easier for farmers to get production licenses, get loans to grow hemp, and allowed them to get federal crop insurance. Some states still consider it illegal to grow hemp, but 47 states have enacted legislation to make hemp legal to grow at the state level, as of 2019. The process to legalize hemp cultivation began in 2009, when Oregon began approving licenses for industrial hemp. Then, in 2013, after the legalization of marijuana, several farmers in Colorado planted and harvested several acres of hemp, bringing in the first hemp crop in the United States in over half a century. After that, the federal government created a Hemp Farming Pilot Program as a part of the Agricultural Act of 2014. This program allowed institutions of higher education and state agricultural departments to begin growing hemp without the consent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Hemp production in Kentucky, formerly the United States' leading producer, resumed in 2014. Hemp production in North Carolina resumed in 2017, and in Washington State the same year. By the end of 2017, at least 34 U.S. states had industrial hemp programs. In 2018, New York began taking strides in industrial hemp production, along with hemp research pilot programs at Cornell University, Binghamton University and SUNY Morrisville. As of 2017 the hemp industry estimated that annual sales of hemp products were around $820 million annually; hemp-derived CBD have been the major force driving this growth. Despite this progress, hemp businesses in the US have had difficulties expanding as they have faced challenges in traditional marketing and sales approaches. According to a case study done by Forbes, hemp businesses and startups have had difficulty marketing and selling non-psychoactive hemp products, as some online advertising platforms and financial institutions do not distinguish between hemp and marijuana. History Hemp is possibly one of the earliest plants to be cultivated. An archeological site in the Oki Islands near Japan contained cannabis achenes from about 8000 BC, probably signifying use of the plant. Hemp use archaeologically dates back to the Neolithic Age in China, with hemp fiber imprints found on Yangshao culture pottery dating from the 5th millennium BC.Barber, E. J. W. (1992). Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean. Princeton University Press. p. 17. The Chinese later used hemp to make clothes, shoes, ropes, and an early form of paper. The classical Greek historian Herodotus (ca. 480 BC) reported that the inhabitants of Scythia would often inhale the vapors of hemp-seed smoke, both as ritual and for their own pleasurable recreation. Textile expert Elizabeth Wayland Barber summarizes the historical evidence that Cannabis sativa, \\"grew and was known in the Neolithic period all across the northern latitudes, from Europe (Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Romania, Ukraine) to East Asia (Tibet and China),\\" but, \\"textile use of Cannabis sativa does not surface for certain in the West until relatively late, namely the Iron Age.\\"Barber, E. J. W. (1992). Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean. Princeton University Press. p. 18. \\"I strongly suspect, however, that what catapulted hemp to sudden fame and fortune as a cultigen and caused it to spread rapidly westwards in the first millennium B.C. was the spread of the habit of pot-smoking from somewhere in south-central Asia, where the drug-bearing variety of the plant originally occurred. The linguistic evidence strongly supports this theory, both as to time and direction of spread and as to cause.\\"Barber (1992). p. 19. Jews living in Palestine in the 2nd century were familiar with the cultivation of hemp, as witnessed by a reference to it in the Mishna (Kil'ayim 2:5) as a variety of plant, along with Arum, that sometimes takes as many as three years to grow from a seedling. In late medieval Germany and Italy, hemp was employed in cooked dishes, as filling in pies and tortes, or boiled in a soup.Regional Cuisines of Medieval Europe: A Book of Essays (2002), edited by Melitta Weiss Adamson, , pg. 98, 166 Hemp in later Europe was mainly cultivated for its fibers and was used for ropes on many ships, including those of Christopher Columbus. The use of hemp as a cloth was centered largely in the countryside, with higher quality textiles being available in the towns. Cannabis sativa from Vienna Dioscurides, 512 AD. The Spaniards brought hemp to the Americas and cultivated it in Chile starting about 1545. Similar attempts were made in Peru, Colombia, and Mexico, but only in Chile did the crop find success. In July 1605, Samuel Champlain reported the use of grass and hemp clothing by the (Wampanoag) people of Cape Cod and the (Nauset) people of Plymouth Bay told him they harvested hemp in their region where it grew wild to a height of 4 to 5 ft. Champlain, Samuel, Henry P. Biggar. 1929. The Works of Samuel de Champlain, vol 1. Toronto: Champlain Society. pp. 341‚Äì56. In May 1607, \\"hempe\\" was among the crops Gabriel Archer observed being cultivated by the natives at the main Powhatan village, where Richmond, Virginia is now situated;Gabriel Archer, A Relatyon of the Discoverie of Our River..., printed in Archaeologia Americana 1860, p. 44. William Strachey (1612) records a native (Powhatan) name for hemp (weihkippeis). and in 1613, Samuell Argall reported wild hemp \\"better than that in England\\" growing along the shores of the upper Potomac. As early as 1619, the first Virginia House of Burgesses passed an Act requiring all planters in Virginia to sow \\"both English and Indian\\" hemp on their plantations.Proceedings of the Virginia Assembly, 1619 , cf. the 1633 Act: Hening's Statutes at Large, p. 218 The Puritans are first known to have cultivated hemp in New England in 1645. =United States= George Washington pushed for the growth of hemp as it was a cash crop commonly used to make rope and fabric. In May 1765 he noted in his diary about the sowing of seeds each day until mid-April. Then he recounts the harvest in October which he grew 27 bushels that year. It is sometimes supposed that an excerpt from Washington's diary, which reads \\"Began to the Male from the Female hemp at Do.&‚Äîrather too late\\" is evidence that he was trying to grow female plants for the THC found in the flowers. However, the editorial remark accompanying the diary states that \\"This may arise from their [the male] being coarser, and the stalks larger\\" In subsequent days, he describes soaking the hemp (to make the fibers usable) and harvesting the seeds, suggesting that he was growing hemp for industrial purposes, not recreational. George Washington also imported the Indian Hemp plant from Asia, which was used for fiber and, by some growers, for intoxicating resin production. In a 1796 letter to William Pearce who managed the plants for him, Washington says, \\"What was done with the Indian Hemp plant from last summer? It ought, all of it, to be sown again; that not only a stock of seed sufficient for my own purposes might have been raised, but to have disseminated seed to others; as it is more valuable than common hemp.\\" Other presidents known to have farmed hemp for alternative purposes include Thomas Jefferson,Bear, James A. Jr., and Lucia C. Stanton, eds. Jefferson's Memorandum Books: Accounts, with Legal Records and Miscellany, 1767‚Äì1826. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997, 1:383.

Print Historically, hemp production had made up a significant portion of antebellum Kentucky's economy. Before the American Civil War, many slaves worked on plantations producing hemp.James F. Hopkins, \\"Slavery in the Hemp Industry\\", Drug Library In 1937, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was passed in the United States, levying a tax on anyone who dealt commercially in cannabis, hemp, or marijuana. The passing of the Act to destroy the U.S. hemp industry has been disputed to involve businessmen Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst and the Du Pont family.Earlywine, 2005: p. 24Peet, 2004: p. 55 One claim is that Hearst believed that his extensive timber holdings were threatened by the invention of the decorticator that he feared would allow hemp to become a cheap substitute for the paper pulp used for newspaper. Historical research indicates this fear was unfounded because improvements of the decorticators in the 1930s ‚Äì machines that separated the fibers from the hemp stem ‚Äì could not make hemp fiber a cheaper substitute for fibers from other sources. Further, decorticators did not perform satisfactorily in commercial production. Another claim is that Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury and the wealthiest man in America at that time, had invested heavily in DuPont's new synthetic fiber, nylon, and believed that the replacement of the traditional resource, hemp, was integral to the new product's success. The company DuPont and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp, nylon became immediately a scarce commodity. Nylon had characteristics that could be used for toothbrushes (sold from 1938) and very thin nylon fiber could compete with silk and rayon in various textiles normally not produced from hemp fiber, such as very thin stockings for women. While the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 had just been signed into law, the United States Department of Agriculture lifted the tax on hemp cultivation during WW II. Before WW II, the U.S. Navy used Jute and Manila Hemp from the Philippines and Indonesia for the cordage on their ships. During the war, Japan cut off those supply lines. America was forced to turn inward and revitalize the cultivation of Hemp on U.S. soils. Hemp was used extensively by the United States during World War II to make uniforms, canvas, and rope. Much of the hemp used was cultivated in Kentucky and the Midwest. During World War II, the U.S. produced a short 1942 film, Hemp for Victory, promoting hemp as a necessary crop to win the war. U.S. farmers participated in the campaign to increase U.S. hemp production to 36,000 acres in 1942. This increase amounted to more than 20 times the production in 1941 before the war effort.

In the United States, hemp cultivation is legally prohibited, but during World War II farmers were encouraged to grow hemp for cordage, to replace Manila hemp previously obtained from Japanese- controlled areas. The U.S. government produced a film explaining the uses of hemp, called Hemp for Victory. =Historical cultivation= Hemp has been grown for millennia in Asia and the Middle East for its fibre. Commercial production of hemp in the West took off in the eighteenth century, but was grown in the sixteenth century in eastern England. Because of colonial and naval expansion of the era, economies needed large quantities of hemp for rope and oakum. In the early 1940s, world production of hemp fiber ranged from 250 000 to 350 000 metric tonnes, Russia was the biggest producer. In Western Europe, the cultivation of hemp was not legally banned by the 1930s, but the commercial cultivation stopped by then, due to decreased demand compared to increasingly popular artificial fibers. Speculation about the potential for commercial cultivation of hemp in large quantities has been criticized due to successful competition from other fibers for many products. The world production of hemp fiber fell from over 300,000 metric tons 1961 to about 75,000 metric tons in the early 1990s and has after that been stable at that level. Japan Japanese Shinto shrine with rope made of hemp In Japan, hemp was historically used as paper and a fiber crop. There is archaeological evidence cannabis was used for clothing and the seeds were eaten in Japan back to the J≈çmon period (10,000 to 300 BC). Many Kimono designs portray hemp, or asa (), as a beautiful plant. In 1948, marijuana was restricted as a narcotic drug. The ban on marijuana imposed by the United States authorities was alien to Japanese culture, as the drug had never been widely used in Japan before. Though these laws against marijuana are some of the world's strictest, allowing five years imprisonment for possession of the drug, they exempt hemp growers, whose crop is used to make robes for Buddhist monks and loincloths for Sumo wrestlers. Because marijuana use in Japan has doubled in the past decade, these exemptions have recently been called into question. Portugal The cultivation of hemp in Portuguese lands began around the fourteenth century. The raw material was used for the preparation of rope and plugs for the Portuguese ships. Portugal also utilized its colonies to support its hemp supply, including in certain parts of Brazil. In order to recover the ailing Portuguese naval fleet after the Restoration of Independence in 1640, King John IV put a renewed emphasis on the growing of hemp. He ordered the creation of the Royal Linen and Hemp Factory in the town of Torre de Moncorvo to increase production and support the effort. In 1971, the cultivation of hemp became illegal, and the production was substantially reduced. Because of EU regulations 1308/70, 619/71 and 1164/89, this law was revoked (for some certified seed varieties).

It lies within the metropolitan borough of the City of Salford in the Boothstown and Ellenbrook ward, which had a population at the 2011 Census of 9,599. The village is in the west of the City of Salford, bordered to the north by the East Lancashire Road A580 and to the south by the Bridgewater Canal. Historically, it was a hamlet partly in Worsley township in the parish of Eccles, and partly in Tyldesley in the parish of Leigh. Bothstown lies northwest of Salford, northwest of Manchester and southeast of Wigan. Astley is to the west, to the north is Walkden and to the east is Worsley where there is a transport interchange between the M60, M62 and M602 motorways. Once known for its mining community, Boothstown is now a mainly residential area. History Evidence of the Romans in this area is that in 1947, workmen digging in Boothstown at discovered a hoard of over 550 bronze Roman coins dating between 259 AD and 278 AD. A second hoard of coins dated 289 - 296 A.D. was found at Boothsbank in 1989. =Manor= In 1323 the estate or manor of Booths was held by the de Worsley family and remained with that family, held of the king by a rent of 2s, until the reign of Elizabeth I. In the 17th century the manor was held by Charnock and then by Sherington. Booths Old Hall was built about 1343 and New Booths Hall was built in the early-17th century. The hearth-tax returns of 1666 show nearby Wardley Hall was the largest residence with 19 hearths, Worsley Hall and Booths had 17 each. There were 276 hearths in the township, Worsley proper had 191. The house, in the latter part of the 18th century, was owned by the Clowes family who owned Garrett Hall in neighbouring Tyldesley. Lord Francis Egerton bought the estate from Robert Haldane Bradshaw in 1836 and Booths and became part of the Manor of Worsley. =Industrial Revolution= Boothstown Mines Rescue StationIn 1795 the Bridgewater Canal was extended from Worsley, through Boothstown to Leigh. The growth of Boothstown was based on coal and cotton. Cookes Meadow Pit at Ellenbrook dated from 1760-70 but deep mining came with the sinking of Mosley Common Colliery in the 1860s. An early colliery tramway moved coal from the pits at Ellenbrook down to the canal at Boothstown Basin by gravity, using the slope of the land. Boothstown's underground canal, the Chaddock Level, was used to transport coal during the 19th century. It connected the Bridgewater Canal at a small basin approximately 100m east of Moss House Lane to Chaddock Colliery, the Queen Anne Pit (1810 to 1820) and Henfold Pit in Tyldesley. The keystone on the entrance to the Chaddock Level is dated 1816. The pits on the Tyldesley side of Boothstown had closed by 1870. In 1931 Boothstown Mines Rescue Station was built along with housing for the rescue team members and other staff, it is a Grade II Listed building. A Mr Smith built a small cotton mill in Boothstown Delph by the Stirrup Brook in 1812. In 1891 Edward Makin of Garden Mill had 260 looms weaving \\"regattas, stripes, ginghams etc.\\" and William Yates' Boothstown Mill had 9,000 spindles and 242 looms producing fine quality cotton from 1875 until the mill closed in 1968. Governance From the 11th century, Boothstown was part of the township of Worsley in the ancient ecclesiastical parish Eccles in the hundred of Salford, and county of Lancashire. In 2017 the Boothstown and Ellenbrook ward is represented by three Conservative councillors: Jillian Collinson, Robin Garrido and Bob Clarke. Geography The A572 crosses Boothstown west to east connecting it to Worsley and Wigan. the A580 East Lancashire Road is now the boundary between Tyldesley and Boothstown and crosses west to east at the northern edge of the village. The Bridgewater Canal crosses east to west in the south of the village. There is agricultural and open land in the south of the Boothstown area that forms part of the Green Belt. To the south of the Bridgewater Canal the Geological Formation consists mainly of the pebble beds of the new red sandstone, north of Boothstown are coal measures. Transport Boothstown is served by bus routes to/from Salford, Manchester city centre, Walkden, Wigan and Leigh.

The series ran for a single season on NBC from September 11, 1975, to April 4, 1976 featuring the titular sleuth. The series stars Jim Hutton as the titular character, and David Wayne as his father, Inspector Richard Queen. Each episode revolves around author Queen investigating a murder, usually with the assistance of his father. The series uses some of the same dramatic devices found in the early Queen novels and radio shows. This includes Hutton breaking the fourth wall, to challenge the viewer to solve the mystery. Plot Set in the post-World War II New York City ‚Äì more specifically, the first episode is set on New Year's Eve of 1946 ‚Äì the show revolved around author and amateur detective Ellery Queen (Jim Hutton), a bachelor who lives with his widowed father, Inspector Richard Queen (David Wayne). Ellery solves various cases while writing his latest book, usually with assistance from his father, and Inspector Queen's right-hand-man, Sergeant Velie (Tom Reese). Similar to the early Queen books and radio episodes, the audience is challenged to solve the mystery. For the television series, this led to Hutton breaking the fourth wall before the confrontation scene. This gave the viewers a short exposition about the case, and leaving the viewer to put together the clues. The final act always used the detective clich√© of calling together all the suspects, with Ellery Queen presenting the solution (except in one episode when the elder Queen took over). The great detective's detailed exposition allowed audience members to assess how they had guessed right and wrong. In some episodes, Queen's explanation disproved the theory of a rival sleuth. The series departed from the original stories in two respects. An element of mild humour was added by making the Ellery Queen character slightly physically clumsy, and the character of rival radio detective Simon Brimmer (John Hillerman) was created for the series.\\"Interview with screen writer William Link‚Äù from disk 6, Ellery Queen Mysteries, DVD release September 2010.

The pilot, directed by Barry Shear, aired as a television movie on NBC on November 19, 1971. Peter Lawford and Harry Morgan had portrayed Ellery and Inspector McQueen, respectively, with E. G. Marshall and Stefanie Powers in co-starring roles, and Bill Zuckert as Sgt. Velie. However, Levinson and Link did not like the changes to the script made by producer Leonard Ackerman, and used the pseudonym ‚ÄúTed Leighton‚Äù as the credited writer. NBC did not order a series from the pilot. In 1974, Levinson and Link retooled their idea into a new pilot, this time with Jim Hutton and David Wayne as Ellery and Inspector Queen. A television pilot premiered on March 23, 1975, with the made-for-TV movie Ellery Queen: Too Many Suspects. Levinson and Link adapted the script from the 1965 Ellery Queen novel The Fourth Side of the Triangle. NBC ordered a series based on the pilot in May 1975. A total of 22 episodes followed in the show's single season. The theme music was by Elmer Bernstein. The last episode aired on April 4, 1976, after which NBC cancelled the series. The series ranked 68 out of 97 shows that season. Levinson and Link later retooled the idea of an author and amateur sleuth who solves murders, with a list of notable and up-and-coming guest stars, into the CBS series, Murder, She Wrote. =Reception= Richard Schickel, reviewing the series at its premiere in September 1975, called it \\"a garage-sale period piece\\"; he said \\"the presence of Guy Lombardo, some ancient autos and the oldest of detective story conventions (all suspects are assembled in one room to await the results of the detective's ratiocinations) are supposed to evoke nostalgia. They do not and the format's stasis is numbing.\\" In 1979, Levinson and Link won a Special Edgar Award for creating the Columbo and Ellery Queen TV series. Thirty-five years later, David Wiegand, reviewing the series when it was released on DVD, called the show's formula a \\"completely satisfying guilty pleasure\\" and asserted that the \\"appeal of the series is that the clues are actually there in the development of each show, and just before the denouement, Ellery breaks the 'fourth wall' and asks if you've figured it out.\\" Episodes Home media The series, including the pilot, was released on DVD - in Australia (region 4, PAL) on 15 September 2010 and in the US by Entertainment One (region 1, NTSC) on September 28, 2010. The Australian release also includes Ellery Queen: Don't Look Behind You. In 2016, the complete series of Ellery Queen was released on DVD in the UK.

It is common in the coastal sage scrub of Southern California and northern Baja California. Black sage has a dark appearance, especially during drought.  Description  Black sage is a perennial shrub that grows approximately tall. It is covered with simple hairs with some glandular hairs, which makes it highly aromatic. The leaves are oblong-elliptic to obovate in shape and are about long. The upper surface of the leaf is somewhat glabrous, while the lower surface of the leaf is hairy. The inflorescence occurs in wide clusters. The flowers are usually a pale blue or lavender color, and rarely a pale rose color. The upper lip of the flower is 2-lobed. The style and stamens are slightly exserted. The fruit produced by the black sage is a schizocarp composed of four brown nutlets.  Ecology  Black sage grows in the coastal sage scrub and lower chaparral plant communities. It occurs from sea level to elevation. Black sage is able to grow on a variety of different soils, including sandstone, shale, granite, serpentinite, and gabbro or basalt. It is semi-deciduous, depending on the location and severity of drought, shallow rooted, and drought tolerant by leaf curling rather than drought-avoiding through leaf drop. Black sage readily hybridizes with three other coastal scrub Salvias: Salvia apiana (white sage), Salvia leucophylla, and Salvia clevelandii. It rarely hybridizes with the annuals Salvia columbariae and Salvia carduacea. Traditional use The Chumash people used a strong sun tea of the leaves and stems of the plant. This was rubbed on the painful area or used to soak one's feet. The plant contains diterpenoids, such as aethiopinone and ursolic acid, that are pain relievers. The Black Sage also produces a nectar that Black Sage honey is made from. This honey is typically peppery and strong, and is prized as a rare honey due to the plant's dry climate. Black Sage honey can only be made when specific rain conditions are met and the plant produces enough nectar.

As of 2011, it had a population of 55,784. Maun is the \\"tourism capital\\" of Botswana and the administrative centre of Ngamiland district. Francistown and Maun there are linked by the A3 highway. It is also the headquarters of numerous safari and air-charter operations who run trips into the Okavango Delta. Although officially still a village, Maun has developed rapidly from a rural frontier town and has spread along the Thamalakane River. It now has shopping centres, hotels and lodges as well as car hire, although it retains a rural atmosphere and local tribesmen continue to bring their cattle to Maun to sell. The community is distributed along the wide banks of the Thamalakane River where red lechwe can still be seen grazing next to local donkeys, goats and cattle.  History  The settlement was founded in 1915 as the tribal capital of the Batawana people, it has had a reputation as a hard-living 'Wild West' town helping the local cattle ranching and hunting operations. However, with the growth of the tourism industry and the completion of the tar road from Nata in the early 1990s, Maun has developed swiftly, losing much of its old town character. It is now home to over 55,000 people. Maun is today a thriving tourist town, infamous for its infestation of donkeys and to a lesser extent goats. These animals can be seen standing around town as the local farmers arrive in the innumerable taxis to sell their wares on the curbside. With the influx of tourism dollars, the typical traditional rondavels have been replaced by square, cinderblock homes roofed with tin and occasionally tiles. Mobile phone service in Maun is excellent out to about , depending on weather. Maun is also becoming a regional transshipment hub for materials and tradespeople who service both the local camps and safari centres and the burgeoning mineral exploration camps in northwestern Botswana. There are a wide variety of services in stores as well as many local entrepreneurs with welding ventures operated from the back of a cart. Tourists often fly into the Maun International Airport. Often, these tourists hire a fully equipped 4x4 cars for camping and game viewing in the parks, or otherwise fly to several tourist camps in the Okavango Delta or the Makgadikgadi. Maun, like most areas in southern Africa, has a protracted aviation history.  Climate  Maun has a hot semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSh).  Etymology and logistics  The name Maun is derived from the Seyei word 'maung', which translates 'the place of river reeds'. Before the arrival of Batawana Maun was a small Yei village. The village in 1915 became the capital for the Tawana people. The capital was transferred from Toteng after victory over Ndebele King Lobengula. In a broader sense Maun is a gateway for exploring much of northern Botswana; for example it is the natural hub for visitors from outside the region to explore the Tsodilo Hills and the Makgadikgadi Pans. The Thamalakane River discharges to the Boteti River, whose seasonal high flow reaches the Makgadikgadi.  Commercial development  Sedia Hotel in Maun In 2011, Maun had branches of Barclays Bank, First National Bank Botswana, Stanbic Bank and Standard Chartered Bank with ATM facility. Maun has three main hotels; Sedia Riverside Hotel, Riley's Hotel and Maun Lodge. There are many other accommodations and campsites, oriented towards the safari business like Okavango River Lodge, Thamalakane Lodge, the old Bridge Backpackers and others.  Education  Maun Senior Secondary School is located in Maun.  Sports  Maun also hosts the Sankoyo Bush Bucks, a football (soccer) team promoted to the Botswana Premier League in 2013-14.  In popular culture  The 7th leg of the 22nd installment of the US television program The Amazing RaceThe Amazing Race 22#Leg 7 (Botswana) is focused on what happens to the race participants while in and around Maun. The music video for \\"Am I Wrong\\" by Nico and Vinz, was filmed in Maun, as well as in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. The 2012 TV series \\"Bush Pilots\\" was filmed in Maun.

Today it continues to be used in almost all of the countries that were created after the dissolution of Yugoslavia ‚Äì Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia use it in its original form, while Croatia has switched to a new identification number called the Personal Identification Number (Croatian: Osobni identifikacijski broj, OIB). History The JMBG was introduced on January 8, 1977Law on the introduction of the Unique Master Citizen Number (¬ªOfficial Gazette of SFRY¬´, No. 58/76., reg. 840., pp 1823. & 1824.) was published on 1976-12-31. The Law reached validity on 1977-01-08. Also the Article 12 of the Law gave a five years deadline for the introduction of the Unique Master Citizen Number and applied to all citizens born before then and alive at the time. All six republics passed a law on the Unique Master Citizen Number. Although the Republic of Croatia continued to use the JMBG after the independenceCroatian Law on JMBG from 1992 - Zakon o matiƒçnom broju - Narodne novine 1992-9 in 2002 the official name of the number there was changed to Matiƒçni broj graƒëana (Master Citizen Number), acronym MBG. Changes in the Croatian Law on MBG from 2002 - Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Zakona o matiƒçnom broju - Narodne novine 2002-66 Full text of the Croatian master citizen number law at the Croatian Ministry of Interior Affairs Advocates of the right to privacy argued that JMBG was a piece of personally identifiable information that needed to be protected by information privacy law, mostly because it was unique and it included the person's date of birth. When the law to that effect was passed in 2003, Narodne novine 2003-103 it was no longer possible to use JMBG on identity cards, driver's licenses and similar documents. Even though law hid MBG from personal documents, various institutions (e.g. banks, schools, insurance companies ...) continued to demand citizens to give their MBG while signing various contracts, since MBG was natural unique identifier of each citizen. Seeing flaw of hiding MBG, on January 1, 2009 Croatia passed a new law, Narodne novine 2008-60 that introduced a different unique identifier called the Personal Identification Number (Croatian: Osobni identifikacijski broj, acronym OIB). The OIB consists of 11 randomly chosen digits and has been assigned to all Croatian citizens, companies registered in Croatia and foreign nationals residing in Croatia.OIB - Croatia Although the OIB is in use, the MBG law remains in effect, and the MBG number is still issued. It is used for data coordination among government registries. MBG no longer appears on Croatian identity cards since 2003, instead OIB does, since 2013.  Composition  The number is made up of 13 digits in a form \\"DD MM YYY RR BBB K\\" (whitespaces are for convenience; digits are written without separation) where: : DD - day of birth : MM - month of birth : YYY - last three digits of the year of birth : RR - political region Agreement on allocation of registry numbers for the Unique Master Citizen Number (¬ªOfficial Gazette of SFRY¬´, No. 13/78., reg. 240.) of birth (for persons born before 1976, political region where they were first registered) :* 01-08 - foreign citizens Bylaw on the means for determining the Unique Master Foreigner Number (¬ªOfficial Gazette of SFRY¬´, No. 43/80., reg. 705., pp 1431. & 1431.) published on 1980-08-01 and reached legal validity on 1980-08-09.

History The Byzantine-style establishment may have existed as early as the 8th century, though the present structure is usually said to have been begun in 1104 during the reign of Ordelafo Faliero, although there is no evidence for such a precise date. It definitely existed by the early 13th century. However, if this date is precise, that would make the factory years old today (). Initially the state dockyard worked merely to maintain privately built naval ships, but in 1320 the Arsenale Nuovo () was built, much larger than the original. It enabled all the state's navy and the larger merchant ships to be both constructed and maintained in one place. The Arsenal incidentally became an important center for rope manufacture, and housing for the Arsenal workers grew up outside its walls. Venice developed methods of mass-producing warships in the Arsenal, including the frame-first system to replace the Roman hull- first practice. This new system was much faster and required less wood. At the peak of its efficiency in the early 16th century, the Arsenal employed some 16,000 people who apparently were able to produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly built galley with standardized parts on a production-line basis not seen again until the Industrial Revolution. View of the Entrance to the Arsenal by Canaletto, 1732. The staff of the Arsenal, who were united by their distinct professional identity, also developed new firearms at an early date, beginning with bombards in the 1370s and numerous small arms for use against the Genoese a few years later. The muzzle velocity of handguns was improved beyond that of the crossbow, creating armor-piercing rounds. Arsenal-produced arms were also noteworthy for their multi-purpose utility; the Venetian condottieri leader, Bartolomeo Colleoni, is usually given credit as being the first to mount the Arsenal's new lighter- weight artillery on mobile carriages for field use. The Arsenal's main gate, the Porta Magna, was built around 1460 and was one of the first works of Venetian Renaissance architecture. It was based on the Roman Arch of the Sergii, a triumphal arch in Pula in Istra, now in Croatia but then Venetian territory.Wolters, Wolfgang and Huse, Norbert, The Art of Renaissance Venice: Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting, 1460-1590, p. 13, 1993, University of Chicago Press It was perhaps built by Antonio Gambello from a design by Jacopo Bellini. Two lions taken from Greece situated beside it were added in 1687. One of the lions, known as the Piraeus Lion, has runic defacements carved in it by invading Scandinavian mercenaries during the 11th century. In the late 16th century, the Arsenal's designers experimented with larger ships as platforms for heavy naval guns. The largest was the galleass, already used at the Battle of Lepanto against the Ottoman Turks, and developed from the old merchanting \\"great galley\\". It was huge, propelled by both sails and oars, with guns mounted on wheeled carriages along the sides in the modern fashion. It was slow and unwieldy in battle, however, and few were ever built. The galleon, also developed at the Arsenal, was an armed sailing ship, a slimmer version of the merchant \\"round ship\\". It was useful in major naval battles, but not in the small bays and off the extensive lee shores of the Dalmatian coast. Significant parts of the Arsenal were destroyed under Napoleonic rule, and later rebuilt to enable the Arsenal's present use as a naval base. It is also used as a research center and an exhibition venue during the Venice Biennale, and is home to a historic boat preservation center. Venetian Arsenal, 1724 engraving by Joan Blaeu Mass production The Venetian Arsenal's ability to mass-produce galleys on an almost assembly-line process was unique for its time and resulted in possibly the single largest industrial complex in Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution. So much so, that it was mentioned in Dante's Inferno: The Arsenal's capacity for production was rare in a time when \\"most of Europe had no manufacturing abilities more efficient than the guild system, the slow and tradition-bound way craftsmen had of passing on skills to their sons or apprentices while monopolizing production and sale of craft pieces in a given region... The Arsenal was something different, a harbinger of future times.\\"Dolinsky, Anton. \\"Inventory Management History Part Three: Venetian Arsenal - Ahead of Their Time\\". Almyta Systems. http://www.almyta.com/Inventory_Management_History_3.asp The Venetian Arsenal was not the mass production facility that it was to be until about 1320 with the creation of the Arsenale Nuovo. The Arsenale Nuovo was simply a larger and more efficient version of the original. Prior to this time the Arsenal had served mainly as a place to maintain privately built ships. With the creation of the Arsenale Nuovo, and the development and introduction of the Great Galley, the Venetian Arsenal would start to take on its industrial form. The invention of the Great Galley itself is significant because they were able to be built frame-first. This process used less timber than the earlier hull- first building system, resulting in much faster build times. This was crucial to the process that would lead to the Arsenal becoming a mass-production center. By the 16th century, the Arsenal had become the most powerful and efficient shipbuilding enterprise in the world. Not only did it supply ships, rigging, and other nautical supplies, it was also a major munitions depot for the Venetian navy and was capable of outfitting and producing fully equipped merchant or naval vessels at the rate of one per day. In the rest of Europe the production of a similar sized vessel could often take months. This large production capacity was a result of the massive number of people that the Arsenal employed, almost 16,000, and the streamlining of production within the Arsenal itself. Production was divided into 3 main stages: framing, planking and cabins, and final assembly. Each stage employed its own workers who specialized in that particular stage of production as well as using standardized parts to produce an almost assembly-line process. The Arsenal often kept up to 100 galleys in different stages of production and maintenance. That way, once a galley was launched, another could be immediately put into the finishing stages of production. The layout of the Arsenal itself was modified to enable minimal handling of materials during the stages of production. The Arsenal also saw the use of standardized, interchangeable parts. One revolutionary aspect of the Arsenal was its employment of the moving assembly line. The galleys, through the use of a canal, were moved along during their stages of construction, allowing them to be brought to the materials and workers, instead of the materials and workers going to the galley itself. This assembly approach was repeated in the rest of the world only starting from the early 20th century when Henry Ford began using the modern assembly line. Galileo and the Arsenal Statue of Galileo Galilei In 1593, Galileo became a consultant to the Arsenal, advising military engineers and instrument makers and helping to solve shipbuilders' problems, many of them relating to matters of ballistics. He was also responsible for creating some major innovations in the production and logistics of the Arsenal. As a result of his interactions with the Arsenal, Galileo published a book later in his life addressing a new field of modern science, that concerned with the strength and resistance of materials. This science largely saw its roots in the knowledge of the shipwrights of the Venetian Arsenal. It is also supposed that Galileo's initial visits to the Arsenal were as a result of his initiative to further investigate Aristotle's questions concerning shipbuilding and navigation, found in the Mechanical Questions of Aristotle. As a result of these investigations, which were pursued by observing the work of the shipwrights, Galileo was asked to help in resolving a specific problem with the rowing units of the galleys. As a result of his study of Aristotle, and in particular Question 4 regarding the propulsion of ships by oar, Galileo was able to produce a response to this question and ended up becoming a major source of information for the shipbuilders of the Arsenal concerning matters of rowing, instruments, and ballistics.Valleriani, Matteo. Galileo Engineer. Springer: New York, 2010 Venice's naval power Venetian Arsenal at Govino Bay, Corfu Venice's wealth and power rested in its ability to control trade in the Mediterranean. This would not have been possible without an extremely large navy and merchant force. By 1450, over 3,000 Venetian merchant ships were in operation, both as supply ships for Venetian merchants and as warships for the Venetian navy. The fleet required constant maintenance and outfitting. The Venetian Arsenal was not only able to function as a major shipyard, but was also responsible for these routine maintenance stops that most Venetian galleys required. This required financing, for which the Venetian government spent almost 10% of its revenues. This naval power resulted in the domination of Mediterranean commerce. Venice's leading families, largely merchants and noblemen, were responsible for creating some of the grandest palaces and employing some of the most famous artists ever known. This opulence and wealth would not have been possible without the naval force constructed by the Arsenal. With the creation of the Great Galley and the mass production capacity of the Arsenal, \\"the fleets of Venice were the basis for the greatest commercial power the European world had yet seen\\".Frederic Chapin Lane, Venice: A Maritime Republic (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1973): 1-2. Current Use After years of disuse and neglect, parts of the Venetian Arsenal complex have been modernized and repurposed to serve as the operations center for Venice's MOSE Project, a flood defense system intended to protect the Venetian Lagoon from tidal flooding. Greece Venice built an arsenal in Corfu as part of a network of Venetian arsenals, serving primarily the purpose of repair, and naval stations in Greece, including shipyards in the Aegean Sea, Epirus, the Peloponnese and the Kingdom of Candia (modern Crete). Aside from Corfu, such locations in Greece included Methoni, Koroni, Chalkis, Preveza, Chania and Heraklion. The arsenal at Gouvia in Corfu was supposed to be used for ship repairs during the winter after the two fleets stationed on the island had returned from their yearly campaign during peacetime. The arsenal was also used as storage for the Venetian ships. However, the Venetian Senate, in order to protect the operations of its own arsenal in Venice, chose to limit the kind of repair activities undertaken at the Corfu arsenal. Consequently, the shipyard operations at Gouvia were restricted to basic maintenance such as cleaning and caulking, and many captains instead of repairing their damaged ships at the arsenal chose to sink them. As time went on, the number of ships being serviced at the location declined. Further reading Robert C.Davis (1991).

This galaxy was discovered by French astronomer Charles Messier on February 16, 1777. As an elliptical galaxy, Messier 49 has the physical form of a radio galaxy, but it only has the radio emission of a normal galaxy. From the detected radio emission, the core region has roughly 1053 erg (1046 J or 1022 YJ) of synchrotron energy. The nucleus of this galaxy is emitting X-rays, suggesting the likely presence of a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of , or 565 million times the mass of the Sun. X-ray emissions shows a structure to the north of Messier 49 that resembles a bow shock. To the southwest of the core, the luminous outline of the galaxy can be traced out to a distance of 260 kpc. The only supernova event observed within this galaxy is SN 1969Q, discovered in June 1969. This galaxy has a large collection of globular clusters, estimated at about 5,900. By contrast, this count is far more than the roughly 200 orbiting the Milky Way, but is exceeded by the 13,450 globular clusters orbiting the supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87. On average, the globular clusters of M 49 are about 10 billion years old. Between 2000 and 2009, strong evidence for a stellar mass black hole was discovered in an M 49 cluster. A second candidate was announced in 2011. Messier 49 was the first member of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies to be discovered. It is the most luminous member of that cluster and more luminous than any galaxy closer to the Earth. This galaxy forms part of the smaller Virgo B subcluster located 4.5¬∞ away from the dynamic center of the Virgo Cluster, centered on Messier 87. Messier 49 is gravitationally interacting with the dwarf irregular galaxy UGC 7636. The dwarf shows a trail of debris spanning roughly 1 √ó 5 arcminutes, which corresponds to a physical dimension of .
