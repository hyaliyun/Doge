The film's plot is very loosely based on the French folktale of a nobleman whose latest wife grows curious when he tells her she may enter any room in his castle but one. Plot Set in Austria in the 1930s, Baron Kurt von Sepper is a World War I veteran fighter pilot with a reputation as a \\"ladykiller\\" and a frightening blue-tinged beard. In public the Baron carefully maintains his image as a war hero, a seemingly devout Catholic and a patriotic member of the Fatherland Front, but the Baron has two dark secrets he is keen to hide. All of his previous wives have died in mysterious circumstances, victims of the Baron's impossibly high standards, and he exploited the chaos of the Austrian Civil War to instigate a pogrom against a Jewish community.

Filming took place in Budapest, Hungary and Rome, Italy. In February, 1972, Burton's wife, Elizabeth Taylor celebrated her 40th birthday in Budapest. The party, held at the Hotel Intercontinental, was attended by several celebrities, including Michael Caine, Grace Kelly, Ringo Starr, David Niven, and Raquel Welch, and became a huge media sensation in the then-Communist country. Release Bluebeard had its world premiere at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood on August 15, 1972. It was released in West Germany on December 15, 1972. Reception Critical response Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and wrote, \\"There is no longer any novelty in watching the sad disintegration of Richard Burton's acting career.\\" Roger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote: \\"I have rarely seen a horror film so coyly aware of its own camp potential. But it is better at being foolishly serious than at being slyly humorous, and its few good moments come before it admits that its spook lightning and its maybe 3,000 pounds of phony cobwebs are essentially a joke.\\"Greenspun, Roger (August 19, 1972). \\"Screen: Richard Burton as Bluebeard—He Plays Slayer of 7 Beautiful Women Baron Relates Story in Series of Flashbacks\\".

After escaping from the Pied-du-Courant Prison by allegedly feigning madness, Poutré published a pamphlet giving an account of his experiences, under the title Échappé de la potence (later translated in English as Escaped from the gallows). The work earned him considerable fame, his story being embodied in Louis-Honoré Fréchette's historical play also entitled Félix Poutré (1892). However, it was later revealed that Poutré served as a spy for the British government, which he kept informed on the Patriot insurgents' plans while they were in exile in the United States and, later on, during their incarceration at the Pied-du-Courant Prison. This came following the affirmation of Benjamin Sulte that he had been an \\"employee of the government\\" and the disclosure by Gustave Lanctot in 1913 of compromising documents, which unmasked him as a bogus patriote.\\"Poutré, Félix\\".

After World War I he served the Frontparij in the Belgian parliament from 1929 to 1932. He quit the Frontpartij in 1933 to join Verdinaso and soon became known for his pro-Nazi Germany stance in journals such as De Schelde, Volk en Staat and Strijd. His membership came to an end the following year when he argued with Joris van Severen and so left the group to join the Flemish National Union.David Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, London: Heinemann, 1972, p. 155 Serving as an arrondissement leader for the group from 1935 to 1940, he also returned to parliament as a VNV representative from 1939 to 1944. Given his disposition towards Nazism Hermans became an enthusiastic collaborator after the invasion. Along with René Lagrou, he was the founder of the Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen, the Flemish SS, in 1940. Having left his official engagements with VNV in October 1940 to concentrate on this assignment he also edited the new movement's journal SS-Man.

Hermans was sentenced to death in absentia after the Second World War but he was not arrested until his capture in Germany in November 1946. He was returned to Belgium where his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was freed in 1955.

In May 2007, the Senate resolved to probe the use of funds earmarked for the Independent National Electoral Commission. Ugbane, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on INEC, supported the probe but defended himself against allegations that he had not exercised sufficient oversight. In 2008, Ugbane was vocal in the campaign against corruption and fraud in the power sector during the period when President Olusegun Obasanjo was in power (1999–2007). In April 2008, Ugbane was a panelist at a conference on developing and supporting critical energy infrastructure in Nigeria. In October 2008, Ugbane was a speaker on developing Nigeria's power structure at the 9th Annual State of the Nigerian Nation Symposium held in Washington, DC, United States. In December 2008, Ugbane of Kogi East, which is also the base of Kogi State governor Ibrahim Idris, became involved in a dispute with Senator Smart Adeyemi of Kogi West over nomination of ministers from the state. He stated that nomination of Humphrey Enemakwu Abah for a ministerial position would violate Section 14 of the Nigerian Constitution, which deals with Federal Character. That month Ugbane donated a library to SS Peter and Paul Academy, Egume in Kogi state. EFCC prosecution In May 2009, Ugbane submitted himself to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, chaired by Farida Mzamber Waziri for investigation. As Chairman of the Senate committee on Power he was alleged to have interests in companies that won major contracts in the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), and to have been a beneficiary of the N6 billion rural electrification contract scam. His bail request was refused. Senate Spokesman Senator Ayogu Eze said that the Senate expected justice to be done, but that they would not protect Ugbane if he were found guilty. Also arrested was Ndudi Elumelu, chairman of the House of Representatives power committee. The EFCC was said to be searching for the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Iyiola Omisore, to give an explanation of the way in which the electrification projects became included in the 2009 budget.

It is also the first original game in the series to debut on a portable system (the PSP).http://www.konamistyle.jp/ecitem/item60848.html The game celebrated the 15th anniversary of the Tokimeki Memorial franchise. A special edition package of the game included an OVA, the soundtrack, a character box, and sketches from the artists of the game.http://www.konamistyle.jp/sp/tk4_sp/ The game featured the return of the Tree of Legend from the first Tokimeki Memorial game, as well as the return of the Kirameki High school setting, set 15 years after the first game. Main characters :Voiced by: Asuka Ōgame The female lead of Tokimeki Memorial 4, Maki is a compassionate, cheerful, sincere, and honest person who can get along with everyone and likes to help people around her. Due to this, she readily volunteers to become the class representative and later on the president of the student union. Her favorite hobby, other than helping people, is listening to J-pop music. Her closest friend is Tsugumi Godo. Player will encounter Maki for the first time on the first day of class, as she will sit next to you. Even if you don't date her, she will still help you with a lot of things, especially with setting \\"special skills,\\" which allows the player to obtain skills useful in variety of aspects. Maki's storyline mainly involves around her wish to become a nurse and hesitation that comes with it. :Voiced by: Juri Takita A one-year older student and the president of Kirameki High School Student Union. She bears a number of resemblances to Shiori Fujisaki, the main female lead of the first Tokimeki Memorial, and excels at everything she does. Due to the large load of work she is responsible for, she is very busy and seen carrying a folder all the time. Her closest friend is Kai Ryukoji. In the beginning of her story, she invites the protagonist to join the student union. After he joins the union with Maki, Yu instructs them something that needs to learn in the student union. When the protagonist makes a good relationship with Yu, he knows her weakness, like she always loses her way, and her stories what he hasn't known. The player will also realize the reason why Yu is very similar to Shiori: Shiori is a relative of Yu and the inspirational figure that she has always looked up to since she was young. She believes that if she can become perfect like Shiori, she will be able to find the person she loves and confess her love to him under the legendary tree on the graduation day, like Shiori did. However, when her graduation day comes, she ends up not being courageous enough to confess to the protagonist (who is one year below her), and thus misses the opportunity she has always dreamed of. In the end, on the graduation day of the protagonist, she will appear to confess her love to the protagonist under the legendary tree, saying that it does not matter even if it is not her graduation day. After all, the only thing that matters to her is the protagonist, not the legend, and she believes that they will be together always. Like Shiori, Yu is the hardest character to end with in Tokimeki memorial 4. To win her heart, player is required to have very high status points in every area, as well as able to gain admission to the first rate university. :Voiced by: Sayuri Yahagi Tsugumi is Maki's closest friend who overly cares for Maki and is ready to do everything to protect her. She initially hates the protagonist for being friends with Maki and will continue to do so unless the player dates her to a certain point. Tsugumi is very talented at language and literature. She is often found reading books in the school library. She belongs to Kirameki's literature club. After she graduates, she also continues her education in specialized school of language and literature. While she is academically excellent, she is very bad at sports. Unlike conventional eye-glassed nerdy girls, Tsugumi is neither soft- spoken nor gentle. On the other hand, she is morose and sulky,ready to snap at everyone who irritates her. She is also brave, once seen trying to protect Maki from a group of thugs. Due to these characteristics, Tsugumi is considered the \\"tsundere\\" girl of Tokimeki Memorial 4. Tsugumi's storyline is mainly about how she has to accept the fact that she and Maki have their own lives and that she could not protect Maki all the time. :Voiced by: Kana Hanazawa A genius music prodigy, Rhythmy (a homonym of 'Rizumi') devotes all of energy for music composition. She is seen wearing headphones all the time, which makes people afraid to talk to her. She also does not talk much at all. As a result of her personality, she does not have many friends at school. Rhythmy has excellent sense of hearing, as she can hear and distinguish every kind of sound, regardless of how far it is. Once, she even tells the protagonist the model of an airplane just by listening to its engine sound, despite the fact that the plane is so far away that the protagonist cannot even see it. Her incredible (and sometimes too good) sense of hearing is part of reasons why she has to wear headphones. She also likes quiet places as she will not have to hear and get disturbed by all kinds of sound. Rhythmy's storyline is mainly about her composition based on her high school life. Because she does not do much at school besides spending time alone composing music, she has a hard time imagining how this piece of music will turn out. Her relationship with the protagonist helps her understand more and more what it means to be a high school student. She also appears in Tokimemki Memorial 4 Mobile. :Voiced by: Chie Matsuura The daughter and the only successor of Ryukochi Zaibatsu, Kai is brought up like a boy and has a lot of masculine characteristics. She is very good at fighting and does not hesitate to beat up anyone who annoys her. This makes her a frightening figure among the local thugs. Her closest friend is Yu Satsuki. At school, Kai is a delinquent, hardly going to class or participating in any activities. During school, she spends most of her time taking a nap on the rooftop, chilling out at Kirameki riverside park, or going to game arcade. Despite her delinquency, Kai does surprisingly well in exams and often stays among the top of the class. Kai's storyline is mainly about her decision to succeed Ryukochi Zaibatsu or to be a normal girl. Choosing the later will definitely go against her father's will and may eventually escalate to a familial feud. The protagonist will play an important role in helping her make the decision that is best for everyone. :Voiced by: Emiri Katō Itsuki is a tomboy who has passion in sports, especially soccer. She is in Kirameki girl soccer club and is the best player in the team. She is always seen dribbling a soccer ball. Her closet friend is Miyako Okura. Besides athletic skills, Itsuki is also good at mechanics, as it is related to her family's business :Voiced by: Kanako Tateno She transfers to Kirameki High School in the protagonist's second year. Although she has a blond hair and blue eyes, she is a half-blooded Japanese born in Miyagi Prefecture. She is very interested in the Japanese culture and has a very good skill in Kendo. Fumiko Yanagi is her best friend. Once the protagonist becomes close to Elisa, he will learn that she is very concerned about her being half- Caucasian. She feels that just because of her blond hair, she is different from other Japanese people, and will never be able to really blend in, despite her love in Japanese culture. For this reason, she is never seen wearing Yukata or Kimono, as she feels it will look bad on her. However, if the protagonist can get her to confess her love under the legendary tree at the end, she will be waiting there, wearing Kimino. She will thank the protagonist and say that because of him, she can finally believe that her appearances do not define who she truly is. She also appears in Tokimemki Memorial 4 Mobile. Voiced by: Umeka Shōji Aki is an upperclassman who is extremely talented in chemistry. She always comes up with new recipes for supplemental nutrition and does not hesitate to distribute them to girls who are interested. The protagonist encounters her when she persuades him to try her new formula, which turns out to have bad effects on the protagonist's health. Although Aki spends most of her time researching, she is surprisingly mature and caring. She often gives meaningful advice to the protagonist if he joins the chemistry club, as well as tries to take care of him. This is partly because She is very conscious about the fact that she is an upperclassman, which is reflected in her calling the protagonist \\"Kouhai\\" (underclassman) throughout the game. It is revealed later on that Aki is so interested in making supplemental nutrition because her mother works very hard to support the family, so she wants her to stay beautiful and young. Voiced by: Yuka Iguchi Fumiko is a student in broadcasting club who is very social and loves having fun. She is clumsy, running into the protagonist for many times. She loves cute stuff and considers herself a cute person. Sometimes, she is seen dressed in an animal mascot walking around the school. Despite her small figure, Fumiko is fond of eating. She is also scared easily, so it is not a good idea to bring her to places like haunted mansions. Secret Characters :Voiced by: Misato Fukuen Miyako is the protagonist's childhood friend and also neighbor. She is generally a cheerful, straightforward, and impatient person. She helps the protagonist with a lot of things, including waking him up in the morning, bringing him monthly allowance, and giving him information about other girls in Kirameki high school. Miyako always carries with her a bunny doll that she and the protagonist made when they were young. The bunny's appearance is a cameo of the reoccurring Silent Hill object known as Robbie the Rabbit, subtly foreshadowing Miyako's hidden nature with a company in-joke. At the beginning of the game, Miyako's roles are more like protagonist's male friends in previous Tokimeki Memorial games. Player can ask her girls' profile and their feelings towards the player just. She is initially not datable. However, if the player asks her out for a certain number of times, she will eventually agree to date the protagonist. Once the player starts dating Miyako, a series of events will lead her to misunderstand that the protagonist does not really care for her. As a result, she suffers psychosis and her personalities totally change. She becomes quiet, starts to dress in black, and always talks about scary things. She no longer tells the protagonist girls' information and stops bringing him monthly allowance. She also stalks the protagonist heavily, knowing when he goes out with other girls. If the protagonist dates any girl during this period, he will have to fight the evil spirit of the bunny doll. Miyako will become normal again if the player continues dating her for a while. However, even so, the player will no longer be able to ask her about girls. Also, the player will hardly be able to go home with other girls, given that he will have to fight the bunny before he could do so. Due to all mentioned, Miyako is considered the \\"yandere\\" girl of Tokimeki Memorial 4, and probably is the first one in Tokimeki Memorial series. :Voiced by: Kaori Mizuhashi A big sister of Tadashi and a student of Hibiki High School, which is the setting of Tokimeki Memorial 2. She is a cheerful person who can remain optimistic even in a time of crisis. She likes anime and video games very much, and considers herself an otaku. For that reason, she always disguises as Tadashi and infiltrates Kirameki High School to look for something she wants. She also likes drawing dōjin manga. In the Christmas of the third year, the protagonist will not go to Kirameki Christmas party, instead spending all night helping her with the manga which has to be presented at the Comic Convention the day after. :Voiced by: Yūmi Kikuchi A one-year younger student who is studying Kirameki part-time High School. She calls herself a nickname 'Haru' (lit. Spring) on her diary and wants someone to share the feeling each other, until the protagonist suddenly finds her diary and decides to exchange a diary every month. She works in a sweet shop everyday and has a dream to be a pâtissière.

The series, co-written by Sonia Borg and Hyllus Maris, was composed of four 60-minute episodes to portray the lives of four Aboriginal women in Australian society from the 1820s to the 1980s. It was the first series that dealt with such subject matter, and later received several awards including two Awgies and five Penguin Awards following its release. It also won the United Nations Media Peace Prize and the Banff Grand Prix in 1983. Plot The first episode, titled Alinta: The Flame, dealt with the first contact between tribal Aborigines and Europeans. Set in 1820s, the story begins when two English convicts are found washed up on the beach by the Nyari. They are nursed back to health by the tribe, providing them with food and shelter, despite warnings by the tribal elders. The tribe is eventually encountered by early Australian settlers searching for grazing land. Their culture and rituals are threatened by these newcomers, who begin to settle on their lands, and leads to the annihilation of the tribe. Alinta (Yangathu Wanambi) and her child are the only survivors and the episode ends with Alinta determined that her daughter \\"carry the torch for her culture and the future\\". Maydina: The Shadow takes place in the 1860s and follows a young Aborigine woman, Maydina, who lives with a group of seal-hunters. It is revealed that she was abducted by the hunters as a child and, after years of abuse by her captors, she attempts to escape with her half-caste daughter Biri. They are taken in by Mrs. McPhee, founder and head of a church mission, where mother and daughter are separated when Maydina is employed into service with the church. While there, she and another Aborigine man fall in love and attempt to leave with Biri so that can return to their traditional life and culture in the Australian Outback which the Europeans think is devil art. Mrs. McPhee sends troopers after the three and soon catch up to them. The man is shot and killed by the soldiers while Maydina's child is presumably taken away from her permanently. \\"Nerida Anderson\\" is the third episode in the series and is based on the real-life events of the \\"Cummeragunja walk-off\\" which transpired in 1939. The political actions of the titular character Nerida (Justine Saunders), are loosely based on the exploits of Aboriginal civil rights leader Jack Patten. Nerida is a young and rebellious Aboriginal woman, who returns to the government-established Aboriginal reserve after working in the city as a bookkeeper. She finds the conditions on the reservation have seriously deteriorated since leaving and attempts to encourage the rest of the tribe to improve conditions themselves. Her activities are opposed by the reserve manager who, in anger, orders Nerida and her family tried for treason. The charge is dismissed but the manager keeps his position. As the young men of the tribe are drafted into the Australian Army during the Second World War, life on the reservation continues to worsen. Finally, Nerida leads her family and the rest of the tribe to leave the reserve, never to return. The fourth and final segment, \\"Lo-Arna\\", is set in the then-present 1980s and focuses on 18-year-old Ann Cutler, who lives with her adoptive parents, Doug (Max Phipps) and Joy Cutler (Fiona Spence), in a small country town. Ann's relationship with her parents suddenly changes when she discovers she is of Aboriginal descent and not French Polynesian as she believed. She also learns that she is the biological child of her adopted father Doug Culter and Alice Wilson, an Aborigine woman who lives in a nearby shanty town. In an attempt to \\"resolve her emotional turmoil\\", she considers contacting her birth mother.

She formed a successful collaboration with Sonia Borg, an award- winning screenwriter, and spent five years working on the script. A television series was eventually commissioned by SBS Television, partly because of the efforts of producer Bob Weis, who later recalled his first meeting with the network. The series was directed by James Ricketson, David Stevens, Stephen Wallace and Geoffrey Nottage, then some of the top directors in the industry, and shot on location in Victoria. While many of the Aboriginal cast members were non-professional actors, the series also featured a number of high- profile television actors and actresses, including William Zappa, Reg Evans, Julia Blake, Roger Oakley, Chris Heywood, Tommy Dysart, Justine Saunders, Graham Rouse, Robin Cuming, Max Phipps, Fiona Spence, Bob Maza and Amanda Muggleton. Singer, Yvette Isaacs (Maroochy Barambah) appeared in episode 3. Australian indigenous rights activists Essie Coffey and Wangjuk Marka also made a cameo appearances. Reception The series was aired on SBS Television, and later the Australian Broadcasting Company, during July 1981. Its unique and groundbreaking storytelling challenged conventional Australian history and received almost immediate international and national acclaim following its release. Women of the Sun won several awards during the next two years including two Awgies, five Penguin Awards, the United Nations Media Peace Prize and the Banff Grand Prix. The series, more importantly, for the first time provided the opportunity to tell the Aboriginal story through the eyes of its women, in their own language, and made available to national audience. It also had a significant impact on Aboriginal communities as the series brought up key issues affecting its culture. In 2006, series producer Bob Weis interviewed the leading actresses who appeared in each of the four episodes. He then discussed with them the impact it had had on their lives, as well as on his own, and the issues facing them and the Aborigine culture today. A feature-length documentary was released based on these interviews titled Women of the Sun: 25 Years Later and which premiered at the Melbourne International Film Festival. The series was presented by Macleay Museum at the University of Sydney's Old Geology Lecture Theatre on 25 January 2007, the day before the anniversary of Australian colonization. It was accompanied by the final viewing of the Macleay Museum's \\"Living Water\\" art exhibition which featured \\"artistic expressions of Aboriginal identity\\".

A pattern maker makes clothes. One word.. patternmaker makes patterns for Foundries. In the 1930s to the '60s a patternmaker made more in wages than doctors and lawyers.  Clothing  Apparel patternmakers draft patterns based on a designer's sketch of a style. The designer gives the sketch to the patternmaker, who can ask questions to determine details the designer is looking for. Patterns may be drafted on paper or in a computer program designed for patternmaking. Most of the time, in modern American samplerooms, the patternmaker pulls an existing pattern (or block) and makes a modified copy of it to match the new style, either on paper or on computer. If the style is completely new, the patternmaker will usually drape a rough draft in muslin fabric on a dress form, then show it to the designer to discuss any changes before transferring the markings to paper to create the pattern for cutting. Patterns may also be drafted from measurements, this method can also produce well fitting garments as long as the patternmaker has a good handle on shapes and balance. Patternmakers are also asked to copy existing garments without damaging them. This is a common practice in American samplerooms. Patternmakers have a combination of engineering and design skill. They need to be able to understand what the designer wants, and translate that into the lines of a pattern that will cause the garment to fit correctly. Ideally, the pattern captures not only the fit, but also the flair intended by the designer. Patternmaking is taught in conjunction with fashion design education, as it is vital for designers to understand the apparel development process. It is also taught as a major at certain trade schools. There are many books on the subject, but it is rare for a patternmaker to become a professional through teaching oneself. Apprenticeships are almost unheard of in modern America, but would serve well to improve the transition from student to professional status. Because this occupation is relatively unknown outside of the apparel industry, there is a serious lack of patternmakers who can accurately interpret designs in Los Angeles, and possibly other fashion capitals.  Metal casting patterns used in foundries  The patternmakers' workshop at the Thomas-Morse Aircraft Corporation, 1922 Foundry patternmakers have historically been woodworkers with skills of a woodcarver, woodturner, and cabinet maker. When an object is made from cast iron, cast aluminum or any liquified metal the patternmaker is employed to make a wood model of the object. The original pattern has to be made slightly larger, as metal shrinks when it cools; and often the pattern is made in puzzle-like parts, as the sand mold must be \\"rammed up\\" in a certain manner and the parts of the pattern must be removed from the sand mold without altering the negative space which is left behind in the sand. Pattern makers may also cut negative spaces into blocks of steel where sheet metal will be pressed between two matching shapes. A dinner fork is a good example: a block of steel is made to mirror the back of the fork and a block of steel is made to mirror the top of the fork.

He worked closely with Benito Mussolini and his fascist movement. Path to fascism After studying law, Costamagna joined the fascist movement in 1920 and in 1924 was appointed National Secretary of Technical Councils.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 68 Politically Costamagna was highly conservative and saw fascism as a transitory phase that existed only for the imposition of corporatism. On this point he had a long-running intellectual debate with Sergio Panunzio who was a strong supporter of the fascist state as an end in itself rather than just a means to economic change. He edited his own journal, Lo Stato, which he founded in 1930.Roger Griffin, Fascism, Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 84 Academic career As an academic he was appointed Professor of Corporate Law at the University of Ferrara in 1927, going on to hold similar posts at the University of Pisa and the University of Rome. His corporatist theories were strongly influenced by the statism of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.P. Davies & D. Lynch, Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right, 2002, p. 203 Government work Alongside his role in the academic world Costamagna was also involved at various level of politics in Fascist Italy. Between 1926 and 1927 he was involved in drafting a series of laws with fellow legal expert Alfredo Rocco and economist Giuseppe Bottai designed to convert Italy to a fascist state. The concept of the \\"ethical state\\" that they developed became the official ideology thereafter.Piero Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 17 He then moved on to take a leading role in the Ministry of Corporations. He became a member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1929 and served in its successor the Chamber of Fasces and Corporations. He was admitted to the Italian Senate in 1943, by which time he had become part of the circle around the writer Julius Evola.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 69 Post-war Costamagna did not face prison for his involvement in the fascist government after the Second World War but he was barred from any university involvement as a consequence. He was involved in the formation of the Italian Social Movement and, with his combination of conservative ideals, corporatist economics and Evola-inspired mysticism became one of the leading exponents of the Italian version of the Conservative Revolutionary movement.

Hubbard (born 1939) is an American academic administrator. He was the president of Northwest Missouri State University from 1984 until 2009—the longest of any president in the school's history. During Hubbard's tenure the school avoided an announced closing and created the first electronic campus in the United States. It also experienced success in sports, with Northwest appearing in six national title games and playing some games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. Before retiring in 2009 a program was started to replace students' printed textbooks with the electronic books or ebooks. Before Northwest Missouri Hubbard received bachelor's and master's degrees from Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Michigan. While living in South Korea from 1966 to 1971 he received a degree in Korean language from Yonsei University in Seoul. He then received a Ph.D. from Stanford University. In 1972 he became a consultant at Union College in Nebraska. He rose to become chief academic officer and then the school's president in 1980. Northwest Missouri In 1984 he moved to Northwest where he launched his plan for a computer in every room to make the claim to be the first electronic public university campus in the United States by the time it was rolled out in 1987. In 1988 Hubbard resolved a crisis when the Missouri Department of Education under John Ashcroft proposed closing Northwest and designating Missouri Western State University 40 miles south in St. Joseph, Missouri as the only state university in northwest Missouri. Seeking to differentiate Northwest Missouri from Missouri Western, Hubbard launched a strategy emphasizing a culture of quality. Northwest Missouri State won Missouri Quality Awards — modeled on the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, and currently administered by the Midwest Excellence Institute — in 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2008, the most of any organization in Missouri history. Football powerhouse The most visible differentiation was Hubbard's hiring of Mel Tjeerdsma in 1994 as head football coach for the Northwest Missouri Bearcats. Tjerdsma went 0-11 in his first season. In 1996 his team made the NCAA Division II playoff and won back to back championships in 1998 and 1999. It has appeared in the championship games in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. The success has resulted in several of its games being broadcast live from the Northwest campus. In 2000–2003 he oversaw the $5 million overhaul of Bearcat Stadium (renamed from Rickenbrode Stadium). Attempt to rename the Administration Building In 2009 students at the school actively sought to rename the school's landmark Administration Building the Dean L. Hubbard Administration Building. When the University Regents refused saying the building should not be named for anybody, the students sought unsuccessfully to oust the regents. Later the Student Senate in April 2009 voted 23-3 in a vote of no confidence in the Board and specifically asked for the removal of Bill Loch, President of the Regents.

Bethel Island is an island in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta of Contra Costa County, California, approximately east of Antioch. The island describes itself as \\"the heart of the California Delta.\\" The population at the 2010 census was 2,137, a 7.6 percent decline from 2,312 at the 2000 census.Bethel Island, California Population Retrieved December 20, 2013. History Bethel Island was named for the Bethell Brothers, Frank and Warren Bethell, who formed the first successful farm on the island, called Sand Mound Ranch. Frank Bethell was appointed postmaster of the first post office; however, a pious clerk at the U.S. Postal office did not want the name \\"Bet Hell\\" and dropped the additional \\"L\\" to make it \\"Bethel\\", like the Hebrew term בית אל beth el which translates to \\"House of God,\\" is known for its recreational activities. The island's reputation as such began in 1930, with Blanche and Jack Farrar founding a park with swimming, picnicking and other outdoor activities. This park would eventually be called Farrar Park. Remsburg Marina was started by Warren Remsburg in 1938, and in 1944 a fishing resort called Frank's had gained popularity on the island. The resort was built by the Andronico family. By the 1950s the area became popular with sport fishermen and the rich. Frank Bethell and Warren Bethell's widow, Ann Youree (Hamilton) Bethell sold their interest in the island in 1901. Ann went on to form a successful ranch in Almaden Valley and established the Bethell Block in downtown San Jose (site of the current Federal Building).

Its predecessor was the Alliance for Chile. The constituent parties are the Independent Democratic Union, National Renewal, ChileFirst, the movements Grand North, and Christian Humanism. This coalition speech aspired to leave behind divisions that have polarized Chilean society, and his objective was to work together for the future of Chile by creating a democracy representative of the diverse creeds with respect, tolerance and friendship. El Maule Nace la Coalición por el Cambio History After his separation from the Concert of Parties for Democracy (Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia) and having founded the political movement ChileFirst, Senator Fernando Flores integrated the independent platform next to Carlos Cantero, who renounced from National Renewal to found the Movement Grand North; Carlos Bianchi; and Adolfo Zaldívar, ex Christian-democrat with close ties to the Regionalist Party of the Independents (Partido Regionalista de los Independientes). This group of senators was key in proposing the coalition of right-wing Alliance for Chile, as in the destitution of the Minister Yasna Provoste La Tercera Yasna Provoste: Auge y caída de una ministra for embezzlement and in the naming of Jovino Novoa (UDI) as the president of the Chilean Senate. La Nacion, Duro emplazamiento de Escalona por Jovino Novoa After having joined the list \\"Clean Chile. Happy Vote\\" (Chile Limpio. Vote Feliz, formerly Por Un Chile Limpio), a separation was generated between the founding members of ChileFirst in respect to the position the party would take before the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2009. Meanwhile, Jorge Schaulsohn and Fernando Flores supported the candidate of the Alliance for Chile Sebastián Piñera, Esteban Valenzuela, also a member of parliament, rejected the union with the center-right and renounced ChileFirst in order to support Marco Enríquez-Ominami. La Nacion Valenzuela dejó Chile Primero por apoyo a Piñera The support for Sebastián Piñera by the part of ChilePrimero was made official on May 6, 2009, the same day the Coalition for Change itself became official, joining the Alliance for Chile, ChileFirst and other minor political movements. For the 2009-2010 presidential elections, the candidate for the Coalition for Change, Sebastián Piñera, won the first round with more than 44% of the votes. During the run-off election, Sebastián Piñera won with 51.61% of the Chilean vote, with which he succeeded in retaining the presidency for the period of 2010-2014. Piñera took the presidential oath on March 11, 2010. In 2013, the coalition was composed only of the National Renewal and the Independent Democratic Union.

X-Tazy eventually added progressive elements to their songwriting, and released the album Double Face in Tunisia via USB flash drives in 2005. The album gained some notice in Europe, leading to a contract with France's Bremmis Music. Now known as Myrath, the band became the first Tunisian act to sign with a European label. During this period they met French musician Kevin Codfert, who has been their producer ever since. Their first album under the name Myrath, produced by Codfert, was Hope in 2007. At this time the band included Arbia and Bouchoucha with bassist Anis Jouini, who became a permanent member, plus drummer Saif Louhibi. Shortly after the release of Hope, singer Zaher Zorgati joined the band and took over lead vocals from Bouchoucha. Zorgati's ability to combine Islamic chants with heavy metal wailing became a key component of Myrath's sound, while the band's lyrics began to focus on Tunisian folklore. The album Desert Call was released in 2010; this album's sound was compared favorably to that of Orphaned Land. Tales of the Sands followed in 2011. Drummer Morgan Berthet joined the band in 2012, and its lineup has remained consistent ever since. They began to play European summer festivals regularly, and their first American appearance was at the ProgPower USA festival in 2013. Myrath opened for Symphony X during a high-profile tour of England in 2016. The album Legacy, featuring lyrics contributed by Tunisian poets, was released later in 2016. Also that year, Zorgati made a guest appearance on the album The Source by Ayreon. Myrath then toured around the world consistently for more than two years. During this period they signed an international deal with EarMusic. In 2017, Myrath performed in their native Tunisia for the first time in three years with a concert at the historic Theatre of Carthage. Their latest album Shehili was released in 2019. They appeared at the Sweden Rock Festival in 2019 as a last- minute replacement for Behemoth; and have been invited to return for future versions of the festival.

Sound wave control is accomplished through manipulating parameters such as the bulk modulus β, density ρ, and chirality. They can be engineered to either transmit, or trap and amplify sound waves at certain frequencies. In the latter case, the material is an acoustic resonator. Acoustic metamaterials are used to model and research extremely large-scale acoustic phenomena like seismic waves and earthquakes, but also extremely small-scale phenomena like atoms. The latter is possible due to band gap engineering: acoustic metamaterials can be designed such that they exhibit band gaps for phonons, similar to the existence of band gaps for electrons in solids or electron orbitals in atoms. That has also made the phononic crystal an increasingly widely researched component in quantum technologies and experiments that probe quantum mechanics. Important branches of physics and technology that rely heavily on acoustic metamaterials are negative refractive index material research, and (quantum) optomechanics. The artwork \\"Órgano\\" by sculptor Eusebio Sempere is large-scale example of a phononic crystal: it consists of a periodic array of cylinders in air (the 'metamaterial' or 'crystal structure') and its dimensions and pattern is designed such that sound waves of specific frequencies are strongly attenuated. It became the first evidence for the existence of phononic band gaps in periodic structures.Gorishnyy, Taras, Martin Maldovan, Chaitanya Ullal, and Edwin Thomas. \\"Sound ideas.\\" Physics World 18, no. 12 (2005): 24. History Acoustic metamaterials have developed from the research and findings in metamaterials. A novel material was originally proposed by Victor Veselago in 1967, but not realized until some 33 years later. John Pendry produced the basic elements of metamaterials in the late 1990s. His materials were combined, with negative index materials first realized in 2000, broadening the possible optical and material responses. Research in acoustic metamaterials has the same goal of broader material responses with sound waves. Research employing acoustic metamaterials began in 2000 with the fabrication and demonstration of sonic crystals in a liquid. This was followed by transposing the behavior of the split-ring resonator to research in acoustic metamaterials. After this, double negative parameters (negative bulk modulus βeff and negative density ρeff) were produced by this type of medium. Then a group of researchers presented the design and test results of an ultrasonic metamaterial lens for focusing 60 kHz. Acoustical engineering is typically concerned with noise control, medical ultrasound, sonar, sound reproduction, and how to measure some other physical properties using sound. With acoustic metamaterials the direction of sound through the medium can be controlled by manipulating the acoustic refractive index. Therefore, the capabilities of traditional acoustic technologies are extended, for example, eventually being able to cloak certain objects from acoustic detection. The first successful industrial applications of acoustic metamaterials were tested for aircraft insulation. Basic principles Properties of acoustic metamaterials usually arise from structure rather than composition, with techniques such as the controlled fabrication of small inhomogeneities to enact effective macroscopic behavior. Bulk modulus and mass density Bulk modulus - illustration of uniform compression The bulk modulus β is a measure of a substance's resistance to uniform compression. It is defined as the ratio of pressure increase needed to cause a given relative decrease in volume. The mass density (or just \\"density\\") of a material is defined as mass per unit volume and is expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). In all three classic states of matter—gas, liquid, or solid—the density varies with a change in temperature or pressure, with gases being the most susceptible to those changes. The spectrum of densities is wide-ranging: from 1015 g/cm3 for neutron stars, 1.00 g/cm3 for water, to 1.2×10−3 g/cm3 for air. Other relevant parameters are area density which is mass over a (two-dimensional) area, linear density - mass over a one-dimensional line, and relative density, which is a density divided by the density of a reference material, such as water. For acoustic materials and acoustic metamaterials, both bulk modulus and density are component parameters, which define their refractive index. The acoustic refractive index is similar to the concept used in optics, but it concerns pressure or shear waves, instead of electromagnetic waves.  Theoretical model  Comparison of 1D, 2D and 3D phononic crystal structures where the metamaterial exhibits a periodic variation of sound speed in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions (from left to right, respectively).Acoustic metamaterials or phononic crystals can be understood as the acoustic analog of photonic crystals: instead of electromagnetic waves (photons) propagating through a material with a periodically modified optical refractive index (resulting in a modified speed of light), the phononic crystal comprises pressure waves (phonons) propagating through a material with a periodically modified acoustic refractive index, resulting in a modified speed of sound. In addition to the parallel concepts of refractive index and crystal structure, electromagnetic waves and acoustic waves are both mathematically described by the wave equation. The simplest realization of an acoustic metamaterial would constitute the propagation of a pressure wave through a slab with a periodically modified refractive index in one dimension. In that case, the behavior of the wave through the slab or 'stack' can be predicted and analyzed using transfer matrices. This method is ubiquitous in optics, where it is used for the description of light waves propagating through a distributed Bragg reflector.  Negative refractive index acoustic metamaterials  In certain frequency bands, the effective mass density and bulk modulus may become negative. This results in a negative refractive index. Flat slab focusing, which can result in super resolution, is similar to electromagnetic metamaterials. The double negative parameters are a result of low-frequency resonances. In combination with a well-defined polarization during wave propagation; k = |n|ω, is an equation for refractive index as sound waves interact with acoustic metamaterials (below): ::n^2=\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\beta} The inherent parameters of the medium are the mass density ρ, bulk modulus β, and chirality k. Chirality, or handedness, determines the polarity of wave propagation (wave vector). Hence within the last equation, Veselago-type solutions (n2 = u*ε) are possible for wave propagation as the negative or positive state of ρ and β determine the forward or backward wave propagation. In electromagnetic metamaterials negative permittivity can be found in natural materials. However, negative permeability has to be intentionally created in the artificial transmission medium. For acoustic materials neither negative ρ nor negative β are found in naturally occurring materials; they are derived from the resonant frequencies of an artificially fabricated transmission medium, and such negative values are an anomalous response. Negative ρ or β means that at certain frequencies the medium expands when experiencing compression (negative modulus), and accelerates to the left when being pushed to the right (negative density). Electromagnetic field vs acoustic field The electromagnetic spectrum extends from below frequencies used for modern radio to gamma radiation at the short-wavelength end, covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom. In comparison, infrasonic frequencies range from 20 Hz down to 0.001 Hz, audible frequencies are 20 Hz to 20 kHz and the ultrasonic range is above 20 kHz. While electromagnetic waves can travel in vacuum, acoustic wave propagation requires a medium. Mechanics of lattice waves right In a rigid lattice structure, atoms exert force on each other, maintaining equilibrium. Most of these atomic forces, such as covalent or ionic bonds, are of electric nature. The magnetic force, and the force of gravity are negligible. Because of the bonding between them, the displacement of one or more atoms from their equilibrium positions gives rise to a set of vibration waves propagating through the lattice. One such wave is shown in the figure to the right. The amplitude of the wave is given by the displacements of the atoms from their equilibrium positions. The wavelength λ is marked. There is a minimum possible wavelength, given by the equilibrium separation a between atoms. Any wavelength shorter than this can be mapped onto a long wavelength, due to effects similar to aliasing. Research and applications Applications of acoustic metamaterial research include seismic wave reflection and vibration control technologies related to earthquakes, as well as precision sensing. Phononic crystals can be engineered to exhibit band gaps for phonons, similar to the existence of band gaps for electrons in solids and to the existence of electron orbitals in atoms. However, unlike atoms and natural materials, the properties of metamaterials can be fine-tuned (for example through microfabrication). For that reason, they constitute a potential testbed for fundamental physics and quantum technologies. They also have a variety of engineering applications, for example they are widely used as a mechanical component in optomechanical systems.Eichenfield, M., Chan, J., Camacho, R. et al. Optomechanical crystals . Nature 462, 78–82 (2009). https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08524 Sonic crystals In 2000, the research of Liu et al. paved the way to acoustic metamaterials through sonic crystals, which exhibit spectral gaps two orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength of sound. The spectral gaps prevent the transmission of waves at prescribed frequencies. The frequency can be tuned to desired parameters by varying the size and geometry. The fabricated material consisted of high- density solid lead balls as the core, one centimeter in size and coated with a 2.5-mm layer of rubber silicone. These were arranged in an 8 × 8 × 8 cube crystal lattice structure. The balls were cemented into the cubic structure with an epoxy. Transmission was measured as a function of frequency from 250 to 1600 Hz for a four-layer sonic crystal. A two-centimeter slab absorbed sound that normally would require a much thicker material, at 400 Hz. A drop in amplitude was observed at 400 and 1100 Hz. The amplitudes of the sound waves entering the surface were compared with the sound waves at the center of the structure. The oscillations of the coated spheres absorbed sonic energy, which created the frequency gap; the sound energy was absorbed exponentially as the thickness of the material increased. The key result was the negative elastic constant created from resonant frequencies of the material. Projected applications of sonic crystals are seismic wave reflection and ultrasonics. Split-ring resonators for acoustic metamaterials Copper split-ring resonators and wires mounted on interlocking sheets of fiberglass circuit board. A split-ring resonator consists of an inner square with a split on one side embedded in an outer square with a split on the other side. The split- ring resonators are on the front and right surfaces of the square grid and the single vertical wires are on the back and left surfaces. In 2004 split-ring resonators (SRR) became the object of acoustic metamaterial research. An analysis of the frequency band gap characteristics, derived from the inherent limiting properties of artificially created SRRs, paralleled an analysis of sonic crystals. The band gap properties of SRRs were related to sonic crystal band gap properties. Inherent in this inquiry is a description of mechanical properties and problems of continuum mechanics for sonic crystals, as a macroscopically homogeneous substance. The correlation in band gap capabilities includes locally resonant elements and elastic moduli which operate in a certain frequency range. Elements which interact and resonate in their respective localized area are embedded throughout the material. In acoustic metamaterials, locally resonant elements would be the interaction of a single 1-cm rubber sphere with the surrounding liquid. The values of the stop band and band gap frequencies can be controlled by choosing the size, types of materials, and the integration of microscopic structures which control the modulation of the frequencies. These materials are then able to shield acoustic signals and attenuate the effects of anti-plane shear waves. By extrapolating these properties to larger scales it could be possible to create seismic wave filters (see Seismic metamaterials). Arrayed metamaterials can create filters or polarizers of either electromagnetic or elastic waves. Methods which can be applied to two-dimensional stop band and band gap control with either photonic or sonic structures have been developed. Similar to photonic and electromagnetic metamaterial fabrication, a sonic metamaterial is embedded with localized sources of mass density ρ and the bulk modulus β parameters, which are analogous to permittivity and permeability, respectively. The sonic (or phononic) metamaterials are sonic crystals. These crystals have a solid lead core and a softer, more elastic silicone coating. The sonic crystals had built-in localized resonances due to the coated spheres which result in almost flat dispersion curves. Movchan and Guenneau analyzed and presented low-frequency band gaps and localized wave interactions of the coated spheres. This method can be used to tune band gaps inherent in the material, and to create new low-frequency band gaps. It is also applicable for designing low-frequency phononic crystal waveguides. Phononic crystals Phononic crystals are synthetic materials formed by periodic variation of the acoustic properties of the material (i.e., elasticity and mass). One of their main properties is the possibility of having a phononic band gap. A phononic crystal with phononic band gap prevents phonons of selected ranges of frequencies from being transmitted through the material. To obtain the frequency band structure of a phononic crystal, Bloch wave theory is applied on a single unit cell in the reciprocal lattice space (Brillouin zone). Several numerical methods are available for this problem, such as the planewave expansion method, the finite element method, and the finite difference method. In order to speed up the calculation of the frequency band structure, the Reduced Bloch Mode Expansion (RBME) method can be used. The RBME applies \\"on top\\" of any of the primary expansion numerical methods mentioned above. For large unit cell models, the RBME method can reduce the time for computing the band structure by up to two orders of magnitude. The basis of phononic crystals dates back to Isaac Newton who imagined that sound waves propagated through air in the same way that an elastic wave would propagate along a lattice of point masses connected by springs with an elastic force constant E. This force constant is identical to the modulus of the material. With phononic crystals of materials with differing modulus the calculations are more complicated than this simple model. A key factor for acoustic band gap engineering is the impedance mismatch between periodic elements comprising the crystal and the surrounding medium. When an advancing wave-front meets a material with very high impedance it will tend to increase its phase velocity through that medium. Likewise, when the advancing wave- front meets a low impedance medium it will slow down. This concept can be exploited with periodic arrangements of impedance-mismatched elements to affect acoustic waves in the crystal. The position of the band gap in frequency space for a phononic crystal is controlled by the size and arrangement of the elements comprising the crystal. The width of the band gap is generally related to the difference in the speed of sound (due to impedance differences) through the materials that form the composite. Double-negative acoustic metamaterial In-phase waves Out-of-phase waves Left: the real part of a plane wave moving from top to bottom. Right: the same wave after a central section underwent a phase shift, for example, by passing through metamaterial inhomogeneities of different thickness than the other parts. (The illustration on the right ignores the effect of diffraction whose effect increases over large distances). Electromagnetic (isotropic) metamaterials have built-in resonant structures that exhibit effective negative permittivity and negative permeability for some frequency ranges. In contrast, it is difficult to build composite acoustic materials with built-in resonances such that the two effective response functions are negative within the capability or range of the transmission medium. The mass density ρ and bulk modulus β are position dependent. Using the formulation of a plane wave the wave vector is: :::::: \\\\vec{k} = \\\\frac{\\\\ |n\\\\omega}{c}. \\\\, With angular frequency represented by ω, and c being the propagation speed of acoustic signal through the homogeneous medium. With constant density and bulk modulus as constituents of the medium, the refractive index is expressed as n2 = ρ / β. In order to develop a propagating plane wave through the material, it is necessary for both ρ and β to be either positive or negative. When the negative parameters are achieved, the mathematical result of the Poynting vector \\\\scriptstyle \\\\overleftarrow{s} is in the opposite direction of the wave vector \\\\scriptstyle \\\\overrightarrow{k}. This requires negativity in bulk modulus and density. Natural materials do not have a negative density or a negative bulk modulus, but, negative values are mathematically possible, and can be demonstrated when dispersing soft rubber in a liquid. Even for composite materials, the effective bulk modulus and density should be normally bounded by the values of the constituents, i.e., the derivation of lower and upper bounds for the elastic moduli of the medium. The expectation for positive bulk modulus and positive density is intrinsic. For example, dispersing spherical solid particles in a fluid result in the ratio governed by the specific gravity when interacting with the long acoustic wavelength (sound). Mathematically, it can be proven that βeff and ρeff are definitely positive for natural materials. The exception occurs at low resonant frequencies. As an example, acoustic double negativity is theoretically demonstrated with a composite of soft, silicone rubber spheres suspended in water. In soft rubber, sound travels much slower than through the water. The high velocity contrast of sound speeds between the rubber spheres and the water allows for the transmission of very low monopolar and dipolar frequencies. This is an analogue to analytical solution for the scattering of electromagnetic radiation, or electromagnetic plane wave scattering, by spherical particles - dielectric spheres. Hence, there is a narrow range of normalized frequencies 0.035 < ωa/(2πc) < 0.04 where the bulk modulus and negative density are both negative. Here a is the lattice constant if the spheres are arranged in a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice; ω is angular frequency and c is speed of the acoustic signal. The effective bulk modulus and density near the static limit are positive as predicted. The monopolar resonance creates a negative bulk modulus above the normalized frequency at about 0.035 while the dipolar resonance creates a negative density above the normalized frequency at about 0.04. This behavior is analogous to low-frequency resonances produced in SRRs (electromagnetic metamaterial). The wires and split rings create intrinsic electric dipolar and magnetic dipolar response. With this artificially constructed acoustic metamaterial of rubber spheres and water, only one structure (instead of two) creates the low-frequency resonances to achieve double negativity. With monopolar resonance, the spheres expand, which produces a phase shift between the waves passing through rubber and water. This creates a negative response. The dipolar resonance creates a negative response such that the frequency of the center of mass of the spheres is out of phase with the wave vector of the sound wave (acoustic signal). If these negative responses are large enough to compensate the background fluid, one can have both negative effective bulk modulus and negative effective density. Both the mass density and the reciprocal of the bulk modulus decrease in magnitude fast enough for the group velocity to become negative (double negativity). This gives rise to the desired results of negative refraction. The double negativity is a consequence of resonance and the resulting negative refraction properties. Metamaterial with simultaneously negative bulk modulus and mass density In 2007 a metamaterial was reported which simultaneously possesses a negative bulk modulus and negative mass density. This metamaterial is a zinc blende structure consisting of one fcc array of bubble-contained-water spheres (BWSs) and another relatively shifted fcc array of rubber-coated-gold spheres (RGSs) in special epoxy. Negative bulk modulus is achieved through monopolar resonances of the BWS series. Negative mass density is achieved with dipolar resonances of the gold sphere series. Rather than rubber spheres in liquid, this is a solid based material. This is also as yet a realization of simultaneously negative bulk modulus and mass density in a solid based material, which is an important distinction. Double C resonators Double C resonators (DCRs) are rings cut in half, which can be arranged in multiple cell configurations, similarly to the SRRS. Each cell consists of a large rigid disk and two thin ligaments, and acts as a tiny oscillator connected by springs. One spring anchors the oscillator, and the other connects to the mass. It is analogous to an LC resonator of capacitance, C, and inductance, L, and resonant frequency √1/(LC). The speed of sound in the matrix is expressed as c = √ρ/µ with density ρ and shear modulus μ. Although linear elasticity is considered, the problem is mainly defined by shear waves directed at angles to the plane of the cylinders. A phononic band gap occurs in association with the resonance of the split cylinder ring. There is a phononic band gap within a range of normalized frequencies. This is when the inclusion moves as a rigid body. The DCR design produced a suitable band with a negative slope in a range of frequencies. This band was obtained by hybridizing the modes of a DCR with the modes of thin stiff bars. Calculations have shown that at these frequencies: *a beam of sound negatively refracts across a slab of such a medium, *the phase vector in the medium possesses real and imaginary parts with opposite signs, *the medium is well impedance-matched with the surrounding medium, *a flat slab of the metamaterial can image a source across the slab like a Veselago lens, *the image formed by the flat slab has considerable sub-wavelength image resolution, and *a double corner of the metamaterial can act as an open resonator for sound. Acoustic metamaterial superlens In 2009 Shu Zhang et al. presented the design and test results of an ultrasonic metamaterial lens for focusing 60 kHz (~2 cm wavelength) sound waves under water. The lens was made of sub-wavelength elements, potentially more compact than phononic lenses operating in the same frequency range. The lens consists of a network of fluid-filled cavities called Helmholtz resonators that oscillate at certain frequencies. Similar to a network of inductors and capacitors in an electromagnetic metamaterial, the arrangement of Helmholtz cavities designed by Zhang et al. have a negative dynamic modulus for ultrasound waves. A point source of 60.5 kHz sound was focused to a spot roughly the width of half a wavelength, and there is potential of improving the spatial resolution even further. Result were in agreement with the transmission line model, which derived the effective mass density and compressibility. This metamaterial lens also displays variable focal length at different frequencies. This lens could improve acoustic imaging techniques, since the spatial resolution of the conventional methods is restricted by the incident ultrasound wavelength. This is due to the quickly fading evanescent fields which carry the sub-wavelength features of objects. Acoustic diode An acoustic diode was introduced in 2009, which converts sound to a different frequency and blocks backward flow of the original frequency. This device could provide more flexibility for designing ultrasonic sources like those used in medical imaging. The proposed structure combines two components: The first is a sheet of nonlinear acoustic material—one whose sound speed varies with air pressure. An example of such a material is a collection of grains or beads, which becomes stiffer as it is squeezed. The second component is a filter that allows the doubled frequency to pass through but reflects the original. Acoustic cloaking An acoustic cloak is a hypothetical device that would make objects impervious to sound waves. This could be used to build sound proof homes, advanced concert halls, or stealth warships. The idea of acoustic cloaking is simply to deviate the sounds waves around the object that has to be cloaked, but realizing has been difficult since mechanical metamaterials are needed. Making such a metamaterial for a sound means modifying the acoustic analogues to permittivity and permeability in light waves, which are the material's mass density and its elastic constant. Researchers from Wuhan University, China in a 2007 paper reported a metamaterial which simultaneously possessed a negative bulk modulus and mass density. A laboratory metamaterial device that is applicable to ultrasound waves was demonstrated in 2011 for wavelengths from 40 to 80 kHz. The metamaterial acoustic cloak was designed to hide objects submerged in water, bending and twists sound waves. The cloaking mechanism consists of 16 concentric rings in a cylindrical configuration, each ring having acoustic circuits and a different index of refraction. This causes sound waves to vary their speed from ring to ring. The sound waves propagate around the outer ring, guided by the channels in the circuits, which bend the waves to wrap them around the outer layers. This device has been described as an array of cavities which actually slow the speed of the propagating sound waves. An experimental cylinder was submerged in a tank, and made to disappear from sonar detection. Other objects of various shapes and densities were also hidden from sonar.

The grant was bounded on the east by the Sierra Nevada Mountains, on the south by the Yuba River, on the west by the Feather River, and included present day Honcut and Ramirez. Diseño del Rancho Honcut History In 1842, John Sutter leased Rancho New Helvetia land to Theodor Cordua, a native of Mecklenburg, Germany, who raised livestock and, in 1843, built a home and trading post he called New Mecklenburg, the site of present-day Marysville. It soon became commonly known as Cordua's ranch. In 1844, Cordua obtained from the Mexican government, a seven square league land grant directly north of his leased land.Memorial and Biographical History of Northern California, 1891, The Lewis Publishing Company, ChicagoHistory of Yuba County California,1879, Thompson & West. In 1848, Cordua decided he needed a partner to help him run the ranch. So he sold a half-interest in Rancho Honcut to a former employee, Charles Julian Covillaud (b. 21 Nov 1816 in Cognac, France; d. 05 Feb 1867 in Marysville). Covillaud had come overland from Missouri in 1846 and worked for Theodor Cordua. He was among the first to mine for gold on the Yuba River in 1848. In 1848 Charles Covillaud, married Mary Murphy (1831–1867), a survivor of the Donner Party. Mary had been briefly married to William Johnson (d.1863) owner of the nearby Rancho Johnson.Meriam Marjory Murphy In 1849, Cordua, sold his remaining half-interest in Rancho Honcut to Michael C. Nye and William M. Foster, brothers-in-law to Covillaud's wife, Mary Murphy. Cordua lost most of the money he made from the sale of the ranch on investments in Suttersville real estate and gold mines, and left California in 1852. Cordua Bar on the Yuba River is named for him. The Memoirs of Theodor Cordua:The Pioneer of New Mecklenburg in the Sacramento Valley Michael C. Nye (1821-1905), an American born of German parents, came overland to California with the Bartleson-Bidwell Party in 1841 and married Harriet Frances Murphy (1828 - 1870), a survivor of the Donner Party. William McFadden Foster (1815 - 1874), also a survivor of the Donner Party, married Sarah Ann Charlotte Murphy (1826 - 1906). Foster Bar on the Yuba River is named for him. William McFadden Foster In September, 1849, Nye and Foster sold their interest to Covillaud, who then had title to the whole grant. A few days later, Covillaud sold half of his property to José Manuel Ramirez and John Sampson. Ramirez came with Sampson from Chile in 1849, to mine for gold. The town of Ramirez is named for him. During the same month, Covillaud sold half the remaining half of his property to Theodore Sicard. Sicard was a French sailor, who from 1842 to 1843, worked for Sutter as the manager of Hock Farm. Sicard Flat on the Yuba River is named for him. In addition to Cordua's Rancho Honcut, the four partners Covillaud, Ramirez, Sampson, and Sicard, known as Covillaud & Co., also bought Cordua's leased land on Rancho New Helvetia from Sutter. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

It lies entirely within the territorial waters of Canada although only about five kilometres from the international border between Canada and the United States. It is approximately long and wide, and in area. The interior is low scrub and bog with small lakes, Little Italy, Hambone, and Deer Lake among many unnamed ones. Several of the lakes are maintained by beavers and all are several feet above Lake Superior.  History  Caribou Island was considered for an emergency landing airport (YCI) during World War II but it was never built because of the proximity of the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, only about 80–90 miles SE. However an interior lake, Deer Lake on the center East side of the island, was used as an Amphibian base with a dock and ramp built by the last private owners of the island because of the unpredictable water/wave condition of Lake Superior. A small three room cabin was built on the east shore of Lake Superior adjacent to Deer Lake and the Amphibian base.Carter, J.L. 1979. A trip to lonely Caribou-island outpost of the lakes (in two parts). Inland Seas. 35, pp. 4-12, 95-103. The island was privately held by a group of hunters and stocked with caribou in the late 1800s. It was considered a private hunting preserve through the early 1900s. The caribou were very aggressive, treeing the lighthouse keeper for hours on several occasions. It is rumored that the light house keepers poached caribou and beaver. One winter, in the 1920s, the caribou just walked off the island when the lake froze over. Because of the Great Depression, the island was not restocked and the island was more or less abandoned by the approximately 15 owners-in-common. The island was acquired completely by the Roys A. Ellis family in the 1960s and was transferred to the Mellon Conservancy Trust of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in the early 1980s to never be developed. In 2018 6 caribou were moved to Caribou Island from Michipicoten Island to the north, due to pressure from Michipicoten First Nation. https://globalnews.ca/news/5094395/wolves-michipicoten-island/  Geology  According to the available information, Caribou Island consists of a mixture of glacial sediments and Precambrian sandstone. Caribou Island is part of a large glacial moraine that accumulated south of Michipicoten Island.Dell, C.I., 1976. Sediment distribution and bottom topography of southeastern Lake Superior. Journal of Great Lakes Research, 2(1), pp.164-176. In addition, exposures of gently dipping, friable Jacobsville Sandstone, have been reported from Caribou Island.Halls, H.C. and West, G.F., 1971. A seismic refraction survey in Lake Superior. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 8(6), pp. 610-630. The Jacobsville Sandstone is the uppermost and youngest layer comprising about of sandstone and conglomerate that underlies Lake Superior and fills the upper part of the Lake Superior segment of the Midcontinent Rift. These sedimentary strata overlie an additional of basaltic volcanic strata and mafic intrusions that fill the remainder of the Midcontinental Rift.Cannon, W.F., Green, A.G., Hutchinson, D.R., Lee, M., Milkereit, B., Behrendt, J.C., Halls, H.C., Green, J.C., Dickas, A.B., Morey, G.B. and Sutcliffe, R., 1989.

Geophysical investigations and crustal structure of the North American Midcontinent Rift system. Tectonophysics, 213(1-2), pp. 17-32.  Navigation hazards  A dangerous reef known as \\"Six Fathom Shoal\\" stretches more than north of the north point of the island, and is rumored to be the one the SS Edmund Fitzgerald shoaled on prior to sinking. A shallow reef to the southwest of Caribou Island Lighthouse lies only below the lake's surface. The now unmanned lighthouse which is owned by the Canadian Coast Guard is located on a tiny adjacent island called Lighthouse Island a few hundred feet across and positioned west of the southern tip of the island. When originally built, it was visible for and operated on a 30-second revolving cycle. These reefs are not coral reefs. Instead they consist of bedrock ridges and interfluves that lie between northerly trending bedrock valleys, which are known as tunnel valleys. These tunnel valleys were excavated by subglacial meltwater at the base of the Laurentide Ice Sheet along pre-existing fractures and joints that exist within the bedrock floor of Lake Superior.Laidly, W.T., 1961. Submarine Valleys in Lake Superior. Geographical Review, 51(2), pp. 277-283.Regis, R.S., Patterson, C.J., Wattrus, N., and Rausch, D., 2003.

North Central Geological Society of America Abstracts with Program, Paper 19–10. Samples dredged from a shoal northwest of Caribou Island and close to one of these valleys resemble Jacobsville Sandstone. The lateral continuity and consistent and parallel direction of the tunnel valleys indicated that they are carved from friable sandstones that underlies the floor of most of eastern Lake Superior.Wold, R.J., Hutchinson, D.R. and Johnson, T.C., 1982. 14: Topography and surficial structure of Lake Superior bedrock as based on seismic reflection profiles.

During the French Revolutionary Wars, he played a significant role at the Battle of Rivoli in 1797 and became a general officer. He led brigade- and division-sized forces during the Italian campaign of 1799. In the Napoleonic Wars, he twice commanded a division and was so badly wounded in 1809 that he was forced to retire from the army. From 1806 until his death he was proprietor of the Lusignan Infantry Regiment. Early career Lusignan was born into an old Spanish family on 23 June 1753 at Jaca in modern-day Spain. In 1771, he entered the Habsburg service as a Fahnrich (ensign) in the Ferraris Infantry Regiment # 14. He fought with a Freikorps during the War of the Bavarian Succession. He became a Major in 1789, when he was stationed in the Austrian Netherlands. The following year he distinguished himself in action near Liège, overthrowing a large body of Belgian rebels with a small force. He received the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa for his efforts.Smith & Kudrna, Lusignan While an Oberstleutnant, Lusignan commanded 800 infantry and 100 cavalry during two days fighting near Virton, a town in modern-day Belgium near the border of France. Under his leadership were four companies of the Bender Infantry Regiment # 41, four companies of the Le Loup Jägers, and one squadron of the Esterhazy Hussar Regiment # 32. On 22 October, his force was attacked at Latour village by Jean-Baptiste Cyrus de Valence's Advance Guard of the Army of the Ardennes, altogether 3,500 French infantry, 1,500 cavalry, and six field pieces. His troops suffered a minor defeat, and the battle continued at Virton the next day. On 23 October, his outnumbered troops were defeated again with the loss of 43 men and 11 horses.Smith, p 29 He fought at the Battle of Jemappes in November 1792. A month later, the French captured him and held him until he was exchanged. In 1794, he became Oberst (colonel) and assumed command of the Klebek Infantry Regiment # 14. In 1795, he fought on the Upper Rhine River under the command of Dagobert von Wurmser and captured a redoubt during the Battle of Mainz in 1795. He commanded one of two advance guards in the corps of Peter Quasdanovich during the actions leading up to the Battle of Lonato in August 1796.Boycott-Brown, p 378 Rivoli In January 1797, Jozsef Alvinczi assigned Lusignan command of the 1st Column during the fourth attempt to relieve the Siege of Mantua. His commander ordered him to take four battalions and 12 companies of light infantry, totalling 4,556 men, on the army's extreme right flank.Boycott-Brown, p 492 \\"Lusignan was faced with the almost Herculean task of leading his men along the top of the chain of mountain peaks (collectively known as Monte Baldo) that separates the Adige from the northern arm of Lake Garda, and runs parallel with them. In the winter, it was a featureless wasteland of snow and ice, the highest point of which lay ten miles north of Rivoli, and rose to the not inconsiderable height of 7,279 feet.\\"Boycott- Brown, p 496 Monte Baldo in summer Not surprisingly, Lusignan's march fell behind schedule in the next few days. However, he persevered under the extraordinary conditions and reached his assigned position. During the Battle of Rivoli, Alvinczi instructed him to make another flank march, this time to a position in rear of Napoleon Bonaparte's French army. He carried out his orders, but found himself isolated on a hill far from the action. By the afternoon of 14 January, Bonaparte defeated the other Austrian columns. Attacked from the north by André Masséna's troops and blocked from the south by a division under Gabriel Venance Rey, Lusignan tried to break out to the west. His soldiers were captured by the hundreds as they collapsed from their recent exertions.Boycott-Brown, p 515 Historian David G. Chandler states that 3,000 men from the 1st Column were taken prisoner.Chandler, p 120 However, Lusignan escaped capture. On 28 February 1797, Lusignan became a General- Major. While commanding the rearguard two weeks later, he was captured during Archduke Charles's retreat from northeast Italy. He served in Italy during the War of the Second Coalition. On 5 April 1799, he led a brigade in Michael Frölich's division at the Battle of Magnano,Smith, p 151 where he was wounded three times. At times during 1799, he served as acting commander of the division.Acerbi, Austrians Advance He led a division in action at Marengo on 16 May 1799,Smith, p 155 He commanded a brigade under Michael von Melas at the Battle of Novi on 15 August.Smith, 163 Emperor Francis II promoted him Feldmarschallleutnant on 30 January 1801. Napoleonic Wars In 1805, Lusignan took command of a division in the Tyrol. In 1806 he became Proprietor (Inhaber) of Lusignan Infantry Regiment # 16, a position which he held until his death. The War of the Fifth Coalition found him in command of a division in the III Armeekorps under the command of Prince Friedrich of Hohenzollern- Hechingen.Bowden & Tarbox, p 67 While leading his troops at the Battle of Teugen-Hausen on 19 April 1809, he was wounded in the head. Though forced into retirement by his injury, a grateful emperor elevated him to the rank of Feldzeugmeister on 29 May. He died on 23 December 1832 at Ivanovice na Hané in the modern-day Czech Republic.

Edited by David Harriman with the approval of Rand's estate, it was published in 1997, 15 years after her death. Some reviewers considered it an interesting source of information for readers with an interest in Rand, but several scholars criticized Harriman's editing as being too heavy-handed and insufficiently acknowledged in the published text. Background When Rand died in 1982, her private papers were left to her student and heir Leonard Peikoff. Starting in 1983, Peikoff began authorizing the publication of excerpts from her journals and other unpublished writings. From 1983 to 1994, several such excerpts appeared in The Objectivist ForumThe excerpts published in The Objectivist Forum were: \\"Philosophic Journal\\" (August 1983) \\"Notes for Atlas Shrugged\\" (December 1983) \\"Notes for Atlas Shrugged\\" (April 1984) \\"Philosophic Notes\\" (August 1984) \\"Notes for The Fountainhead\\" (December 1984) and The Intellectual Activist.The excerpts published in The Intellectual Activist were: \\"From Ayn Rand's Notes for Atlas Shrugged\\" (January 1992) \\"Notes on Scene in Roark's Apartment\\" (January 1993) \\"Notes on the Thomas Committee\\" (November 1993) \\"'Memory-Storing' Epistemology\\" (January 1994) \\"Ayn Rand's Journals: Selections from The Moral Basis of Individualism\\" (November 1995) \\"From Ayn Rand's Journals: Notes on The Fountainhead\\" (January and March 1997) David Harriman, a physicist and a speaker for the Ayn Rand Institute, edited Rand's journals for publication in book form. The hardcover edition of the fully edited Journals of Ayn Rand was published by Dutton in 1997. A paperback edition was published by Plume in 1999. Contents In a foreword for the book, Peikoff describes Rand's journals, with a few exceptions, as being \\"written for herself, for her own clarity\\" and not intended for publication. A preface by Harriman describes the material as being about three-quarters of Rand's \\"working journals\\", collected from \\"numerous boxes of papers she left behind at her death\\". He describes his editing as consisting of \\"selection, organization, line editing, and insertion of explanatory comments.\\" He says that \\"not a great deal of line editing was required\\", and that his editorial insertions and \\"omissions of passages\\" are marked in the published text. The majority of the book consists of Rand's edited journals, divided into five major sections. The first section, titled \\"Early Projects\\" includes scenarios for silent movies that Rand developed when she first moved to Hollywood in the 1920s. There are also notes and outlines for her first published novel, We the Living, and for another early novel that was never completed. Entries in an early \\"philosophic journal\\" from April and May 1934, are described by Rand as \\"the vague beginnings of an amateur philosopher.\\" The second section, titled \\"The Fountainhead\\", consists of material related to her novel of that name. She took extensive notes from her research on architecture, and created profiles for each character, often based on information about real people. There are several outlines of the plot and notes she made while the novel was being written. The third section, titled \\"Transition Between Novels\\", includes draft material for three unfinished projects. The first was a non-fiction book to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism. The second was a movie about the development of the atomic bomb, tentatively titled Top Secret. The third was an essay called \\"To All Innocent Fifth Columnists\\", to be circulated by a proposed organization of conservative intellectuals that never formed. This section also reprints a transcript of Rand's 1949 testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee, along with her own notes about the committee's efforts to investigate Communism. The fourth section, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", has her notes and outlines for her final novel. In addition to planning for characters and plot points, her notes include research on the railroad and steel industries, and thoughts on various philosophical issues to be addressed in the novel. The fifth and final section, \\"Final Years\\", covers the years 1955 to 1977. It includes notes about \\"psycho-epistemology\\" and ideas for two possible books. One was a non-fiction book about Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. The other was a novel to be titled To Lorne Dieterling. Reception Objectivist philosopher David Kelley described the material in Rand's journals as \\"contain[ing] a number of passages that explain key points in her philosophy more fully and clearly than anything she published.\\" Kelley called the book \\"a treasure\\" and said Harriman's editing was \\"skillful\\", although he criticized Harriman for not providing more complete notes on cases where Rand had later changed her positions from those documented in the journal entries. Writing for the libertarian magazine Reason, Walter Olson said the book was \\"a less-than-ideal place to start for those not already closely familiar with the Russian-born author's work.\\" However, he said it did \\"furnish a deep popcorn bowl of sheer fan value\\" for those interested in Rand. A brief review in The Washington Post called it a \\"valuable sourcebook\\" for those interested in Rand. In The New York Times Book Review, conservative writer David Brooks offered his \\"harsh assessment\\" that the insights Rand had about the dangers of collectivism were \\"made absurd only by the philosophy she piled on top of it.\\" For aspiring writers, he said, \\"The journals' central lesson is that one should never underestimate the importance of pomposity.\\" This review produced responses in the form of a short article in Liberty calling it an \\"uninformed hatchet job\\" and a letter from philosopher Allan Gotthelf calling it \\"the usual sneers\\". In a bibliography of Rand's works, Mimi Reisel Gladstein said the book \\"illustrates Rand’s dedication to her craft and her meticulous preparation for writing.\\" Both Brooks and Gladstein indicated that the term 'journals' was misleading because the material focuses on Rand's works and ideas, instead of more personal thoughts. Describing Rand as a rigorous but misanthropic thinker, Booklist said her journals would \\"be of vital interest to many\\". In contrast, Publishers Weekly said it was of interest only for those who were \\"lovers and loathers\\" of Rand, describing the book as being \\"As intriguing yet sometimes numbing as her fiction\\". Choice recommended the book for academic libraries, saying it would be welcomed by \\"Rand aficionados\\". Reviews of the book were also published in Kirkus Reviews and the Los Angeles Times. Concerns about editing In a review of the book in Liberty magazine, Stephen Cox questioned the editorial choices made by Harriman. He said that Harriman tried \\"to steer a middle course\\" between casual and scholarly readers of Rand's work, but he wondered \\"where should the line be drawn?\\" He cited examples given by Harriman as the types of passages omitted, saying some of them were \\"precisely the kind of note that scholars want to see\\". Cox also said that Harriman's editing for grammar and \\"wordiness\\" was insufficiently explained, which acted \\"to undermine the objective authority of the text.\\" In an article in the next issue of Liberty, Rand scholar Chris Matthew Sciabarra raised additional concerns about how Harriman had edited the material. Sciabarra compared a passage that had been published previously in The Intellectual Activist with the corresponding passage in the book. He found differences between the two, including the omission of a reference to Albert Jay Nock in the book version. He quoted Harriman's preface about how changes from the original were supposed to be noted in the text, and said, \\"When such editorial changes are not made explicit, when not even ellipsis points are provided to indicate missing text, doubt is cast unnecessarily on the volume's authenticity.\\" Citing Sciabarra's essay, Gladstein gave the book as an example of publishing efforts by Rand's estate that \\"have not always exhibited a confidence-inspiring level of academic rigor.\\" In his book The Ayn Rand Cult, journalist Jeff Walker suggested the published journals might be \\"completely unreliable and ... may have been thoroughly twisted in the interests of the present-day cult\\". While writing a biography of Rand, historian Jennifer Burns worked with the original journals in the Ayn Rand Archives, and compared the material there with published versions. She said Rand's journals had been edited in ways that are \\"significant and problematic.\\" Burns said Harriman's changes \\"significantly alter Rand's meaning\\" in a number of cases, transforming the tentative and evolving ideas in Rand's notes into \\"a slick manufactured world in which all her ideas are definite, well formulated, and clear.\\" In an entry on her blog describing her experiences at the archives, Burns said the staff of the archives \\"heartily disapproved\\" of how the book was edited.

The current Head of School is Tomohiro Hoshi.https://ohs.stanford.edu/about/staff Stanford OHS used to be part of the wider offerings of the Education Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY). With the restructuring of EPGY into Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies, Stanford OHS became fully separate in its administration from the other components of the program. Stanford OHS is accredited through the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.https://www.acswasc.org/ History In April 2005, EPGY Executive Director, Raymond Ravaglia, proposed the idea of expanding its online course offerings into a full-fledged online school. This informal proposal, made to the Malone Family Foundation of Englewood, Colorado, was well received and the Foundation requested a full proposal. Over Summer 2005, Ravaglia fleshed out his ideas into a full-blown design for an online school for gifted students. In January 2006, EPGY received a substantial gift from the Foundation http://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/april19/ohs-041906.html Stanford Reporthttp://www.docstoc.com/docs/4592601/Press-Release-The-EPGY- Online-High-School-at-Stanford Stanford Press Release to develop the school.

The school accepted thirty students for the inaugural year and projected an eventual enrollment of up to 600 full-time equivalent students. In 2006 Stanford Online High School received official accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The school was approved as an online provider by the University of California in 2008.http://www.best-online-schools.org/standford- university-online-high-school.html BOS Article Ninth grade was added for the 2008-09 academic year, and with the 2009-10 school year, supported by an additional gift from the Malone Family Foundation, it was able to add a middle-school component for students in grades seven and eight. In January, 2015, Stanford OHS became the first online school to be accredited by CAIS. Until the 2014-15 school year, OHS used Saba Centra in order to host its classes, but switched to Adobe Connect for the 2014-15 year and has used this platform since then. Academics Stanford OHS offers classes in nine major subjects: English, Humanities, Laboratory Sciences, Mathematics, History, Computer Science, Foreign Languages, Wellness, and the Core Sequence. Of these nine, the first seven disciplines offer both honors and Advanced Placement classes. Stanford OHS also offers university level classes in English, Laboratory Sciences, and Mathematics. Seminar classes In seminar courses, web-based video conferencing technology is employed.http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/home-schooling- college/745571-stanford-epgy-ohs-calling-ryanone-tokenadult.html OHS parent Concurrent video feeds enable each student to see their classmates and instructors during the seminar, maximizing interaction and engagement. Placement by ability At Stanford OHS students are placed in course levels by their individual ability, not by grade level. Each student's schedule is individualized, allowing them to be challenged at every level. Core Sequence The four courses offered in the Core Sequence cover subjects in science, history of science, political theory, and philosophy.https://ohs.stanford.edu/our-curriculum The four-year interdisciplinary Core Sequence focuses on critical thinking, and oral and written argumentation. Placement in these courses is correlated with grade level, but not restricted for students who place higher. Placement in Core typically follows the students' placement in English courses due to the strong writing components of each Core course. There are two optional 7th and 8th grade classes. *Logos, Cosmos, and Doubt (LCD) optional for 7th grade *Human Nature and Society (HNS) optional for 8th grade * Methodology of Science: Biology (MSB), which introduces students to scientific reasoning, statistical analysis, and philosophical thinking using biology for context. * History and Philosophy of Science (HSC), which focuses on teaching basic philosophical problems, and the methods used to test the resulting explanations. * Democracy, Freedom, and the Rule of Law (DFRL), where students study changing conceptions of how political states should be organized. * Critical Reading and Argumentation (CRA), which focuses on philosophical thinking about modes of reasoning, philosophical discussions of religious concepts, the nature and limits of knowledge, the nature and content of ethics, and the mind’s relation to the world. Enrollment Options Stanford OHS offers three levels of enrollment, determined by the number of courses a student is enrolled in each academic year. All enrolled students receive an official transcript for courses taken at the school regardless of their enrollment level, and are welcome to participate in Student Life activities online and in-person. College Counseling is only available to full-time students. *Full-time: 4-5 courses *Part-time: 2-3 courses *Single course: 1 course (or two semester-long courses) Student Life The Stanford OHS community includes over 100 student-led clubs and circles (unofficial clubs) and a student newspaper. The school offers a fully functional student government composed of class representatives, board chairs, and executive senate members. In addition, the school provides academic advising, college counseling, wellness counseling, and opportunities (such as office hours) to connect with instructors. Select school clubs include: *Astronomy Club *Chinese Club *Debate Club *Girls Can Code *Math Competition Club *Model UN *Quizbowl Club *Robotics Club *Pre- Veterinary Club *Theoretical Physics Club *Yearbook *Spanish Club *Marvel Circle In-Person Events Stanford OHS offers a variety of in-person events, sponsored by the school or hosted by current families. Stanford OHS hosts an annual winter formal, spring festival, graduation weekend, and high school prom at Stanford University campus. Stanford OHS has also hosted a homecoming dance every year since 2015, which has historically been held in Boston on the same weekend of the MIT Splash! event. In-person events hosted by families are known as meetups, the purpose of which is social interaction between students in different cities around the world. Students also have the opportunity to travel on educational trips with instructors. Past trips have included the Galapagos Islands, London, and Rome. Summer Residential Program Each August, Stanford OHS hosts the Summer@Stanford optional residential summer program, open only to students enrolled at the school. The middle school program is 1 week long, and the high school program is 2 weeks long, and both middle- and high school students stay in Stanford University residence halls for the duration of the program. The Summer@Stanford program is open to both returning and new students each year, giving students a chance to connect in person while engaging in a hands-on and enriching academic program. Application and admissions As of 2019, the application requires two essays, two recommendation forms, a standardized test score, one student written work sample, a parent questionnaire, and various other items. The standardized tests accepted by Stanford OHS are: the Middle & Upper SSAT, Middle & Upper ISEE, PSAT 8/9, PSAT, PreACT 8/9, PreACT, SAT, and ACT. Students can apply as full-time students (4-5 courses), part-time students (2-3 courses), and single-course students, and the application process is the same for each applicant regardless of desired enrollment level.

It is also colloquially known as the Baucus Health Bill, the Baucus Health Plan, or BaucusCare. Baucus initially publicly released a 223-page summary of the proposal. It started going through the Senate mark-up process on September 22. That amendment process finished Oct. 2, and was passed by the Finance Committee on October 13 by a 14 to 9 vote,. An October CBO report stated that enacting the proposal would, on net, end up reducing the federal deficit by $81 billion over the 2010–2019 period. History behind the proposal Chairman Baucus was known as the head of a bipartisan group called the 'Gang of Six' in the Senate Finance Committee. Senators Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Kent Conrad of North Dakota made up the other Democratic members of the 'gang', while Olympia Snowe of Maine, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and Mike Enzi of Wyoming made up the Republican side. They underwent months of negotiations and compromises over the summer of 2009 to achieve a healthcare plan. In the first week of September, Baucus began saying that he would push through a plan even if he could not obtain bipartisan backing. He remarked that \\"time has come for action, and we will act\\" on September 9. Before the proposal was made, President Barack Obama publicly promised that he would not support a plan that would cost more than $900 billion over the next ten years. He also said that a plan could not add to the federal deficit, with every bit of new spending completely offset. The Baucus proposal stalled in the committee in August 2009 due to the town hall meetings faced by members of Congress, in which many opponents attended. Alleged conflicts of interests in its creation Senator Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, received over $3 million from the health and insurance industries from 2003 to 2008, more than any other member of Congress. The Republican Ranking Member on the Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, received more than $2 million since 2003. Commentator Jack Cafferty and representatives from the Physicians for a National Health Program and Campaign Money Watch have argued that this lobbying creates a conflict of interest for the Senators. Baucus disputes the allegations, referring to a 2007 meeting reported on by The Wall Street Journal in which he told medical lobbyists \\"[y]ou should worry about me coming after you.\\" Economic background According to Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME), the cost of the average employer-provided insurance plan will rise to nearly $31,000 in several years if no health care reform measures are done. Proposal details Components of the proposal The proposal specifies the creation of health insurance cooperatives, which would be member- controlled, non-profit forms of health insurance that would compete with private insurers. It does not include a public insurance plan. The co- operatives would receive $6 billion in federal funding in 2012 to start off, but they would operate independently after that point. The introduction of the co-ops is intended to drive health care costs downward. The proposal also creates an individual mandate that requires people to either buy insurance or pay a penalty. Those with incomes below three times the federal poverty level would receive subsidies to purchase their plans. For a family of four, $66,150 would be the dividing line. The penalty would be up to $950 per person or $3,800 per family each year. These measures would come into effect for all American residents in 2013. According to Politico: > Senator John Ensign (R-NV) received a handwritten note Thursday from Joint > Committee on Taxation Chief of Staff Tom Barthold confirming the penalty for > failing to pay the up to $1,900 fee for not buying health insurance. > Violators could be charged with a misdemeanor and could face up to a year in > jail or a $25,000 penalty, Barthold wrote on JCT letterhead. He signed it > 'Sincerely, Thomas A. Barthold'. Individuals would be able to buy their insurance from an exchange created in their state, which would be created in 2010. Premiums would be capped at 13% of the buyer's income, with the rest of the costs paid by subsidies. Insurance companies would be required to cover certain services such as hospitalization, maternity care, newborn care, chemotherapy, and pediatric care. Their plans would be presented as either bronze, silver, gold, and platinum options, sorted by the least to the most expensive. Only individuals and firms with fifty or fewer employees would be eligible to use the exchanges until 2017, when states would bring in larger employers. In 2022, they would become open to all. Persons who are not lawfully in the United States would not be permitted to participate in the exchange, either with or without subsidies. According to Baucus: > In order to prevent undocumented immigrants from accessing the state > exchanges obtaining federal health care tax credits, the Chairman's Mark > requires verification of the following personal data. Name, social security > number, and date of birth will be verified with Social Security > Administration (SSA) data. For individuals claiming to be U.S. citizens, if > the claim of citizenship is consistent with SSA data then the claim will be > considered substantiated.Max Baucus, \\"Chairman's Mark: America's Healthy > Future Act\\" Although the proposal does not establish an employer mandate, which would have required firms to provide insurance for their workers or pay a penalty, the proposal requires businesses with more than fifty employees to pay fees going towards the aforementioned subsidies. The maximum possible fee would either be $400 per full-time employee or the average cost of the subsidies a firm's employee's take in multiplied by the number of those receiving them. The proposal forbids insurance companies from restricting coverage based on 'pre- existing conditions'. The insurance premiums can take into account tobacco use, age, family size, and geographic location. Insurance companies would also be forbidden from setting up lifetime or annual caps that specify a maximum amount of care that customers can receive. The proposal also includes a new excise tax on so-called 'Cadillac' health care plans that are more expensive and comprehensive than the majority of plans. Any plan costing over $8,000 for an individual and $21,000 for a family would be subject to a 35 percent tax on the amount past those levels. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that about 10 percent of families have plans that would be subject to the tax. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has argued that this tax is beneficial both because it grows fast enough to keep up with new costs and because it can helps to slow health care cost growth. The group has also stated that the tax will cause employers to offer workers higher (taxable) cash wages instead of health benefits, thus generating more government revenue. According to Congress' joint committee on taxation, the proposal would create $215 billion in the next ten years from the tax. Another $93 billion in funds will come from new annual fees imposed on groups such as pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers. Additionally, the Senate Finance Committee approved provisions that would lump Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) together with high-cost insurance plans and subject them to the excise tax, which would likely cause many employers to reconsider offering FSAs altogether.Associated Press Flex Spending Accounts Face Hit in Health Overhaul Other funds come a reduction in future Medicare spending, which would be over $400 billion in the next decade. Specifically, payments under the Medicare Advantage system would be decreased by $113 billion in the next decade. The so-called 'doughnut hole' in prescription drug coverage would be closed. In the long term, the proposal would set up an independent commission that could alter payments further. Additionally, a small portion of funds would come from a new cap imposed on Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), pre-tax health benefits that enable millions of Americans to manage their out-of-pocket health care costs. Americans Healthy Future Act would impose a $2,500 limit on contributions to FSAs. Unfortunately, 7 million Americans have FSAs above $2,500, and those with the highest out-of-pocket health care costs- the sickest – would be hit the hardest by the restrictions.USA Today. Health Expense Accounts Could Face Cuts CBO scoring of the bill Ford House Office Building, where the CBO is located. The proposal was initially designed to cost $856 billion over the next ten years. However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) stated on September 16 that it would only cost about $774 billion over that period. The CBO report stated that enacting the proposal would, on net, end up reducing the federal deficit by $16 billion in 2019. It also estimated that, by 2019, the number of non- elderly uninsured people would fall about 29 million, which would leave about 25 million of the non-elderly (about one-third undocumented immigrants) still uninsured. Thus, the number of non-elderly legal residents with insurance would rise from about 83% being covered to about 94% being covered. A Forbes.com report has stated that \\"it's not entirely clear what will happen to health care costs in 2020 and beyond.\\" On September 24, the CBO re-evaluated the proposal, taking into account the changes created by the Senate Committee. The CBO stated that the proposal would bring in $23 billion in the first ten years. Specifically, the Committee decreased the penalties for avoiding buying insurance, expanded the subsidies, and lowered the excise tax on high end insurance plans. A CBO report issued on October 7 stated that enacting the proposal would, on net, end up reducing the federal deficit by $81 billion over the 2010–2019 period. That report prompted praise from White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), who called the scoring a \\"landmark occasion\\". Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), criticized the numbers as misleading given that the Baucus proposal would not come into effect for about another five years. Changes to the proposal On September 25, the health correspondent for the News Hour with Jim Lehrer reported that the Committee had cut the proposed tax to medical supplies that belong to 'Class A', which includes items such as condoms and band-aids that cost below $100. Only the other classes would be taxed. On October 14, journalists from the Financial Times stated that the 'Cadillac plans' tax would now impose a 40% fee on any plans exceeding $8,000 a year for individuals and $21,000 a year for families. They also described the individual mandate requirement as \\"much watered-down\\", with those earning less than 300% of the federal poverty now subject to a penalty of between $750 and $1,500 a year. The premium subsidies for low-income individuals included in the final bill were structured to initially limit the premium middle-income people would have to pay for coverage to 12 percent of income.Julie Appleby, \\"Finance Bill's Fine Print May Cause Sticker Shock For Some Consumers\\", Kaiser Health News, Kaiser Family Foundation, October 29, 2009January Angeles and Judith Solomon, \\"Finance Committee Health Reform Bill Makes Improvements, But Still Falls Short of What Is Needed for Many People to Afford Health Care\\", Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, October 13, 2009 After the first year, however, the subsidy would be based on a percentage of premium rather than a percentage of income. Because costs are expected to rise more quickly than income, over time cost of coverage after subsidies will rise above the initial 12% of income limit. Comparisons with other bills Both the House health care reform bill (HR 3200) and the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee's bill (S 1679) had a public plan, however Baucus' proposal did not. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is considered to be more liberal than the Finance Committee. According to Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, the Health Committee's proposal and the House bill would both lead to budget deficits, in contrast to the Baucus plan, which would reduce the debt. Ornstein has argued that this is an important advantage for the Baucus plan. Howard Dean has stated that the majority of Senate Democrats support a more liberal plan. If it reaches the Senate floor, Baucus' proposal will have to be amalgamated with the Health Committee's proposal. On September 29, the Finance Committee rejected two amendments to add a public plan to Baucus' proposal. Senator Jay Rockefeller's amendment was rejected 15 to 8, with five Democrats (Baucus, Kent Conrad, Blanche Lincoln, Tom Carper, Bill Nelson) and all Republicans voting no. Senator Chuck Schumer's amendment was defeated 13 to 10, with three Democrats (Baucus, Conrad, Lincoln) and all Republicans voting no. Finance Committee debate and votes Responses from Finance Committee members Committee Chairman Max Baucus (center) pictured with Ranking Committee Member Charles Grassley (left) According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the proposal was \\"much-anticipated\\" and it represented the only attempt by a Senate committee to reach bipartisan compromise. McClatchy Newspapers has also called the proposal \\"closely watched\\". After its release, the proposal divided Congressional Democrats and attracted no support at all from Congressional Republicans according to National Public Radio health correspondent Julie Rovner. All of the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee initially announced opposition to the proposal. Senator Mike Enzi (R-WY) remarked, \\"[t]his bill does not do enough to lower costs, and in many cases, it will actually increase health-care costs through the new taxes mandated.\\" Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) released a statement on Sept. 22 reading that \\"the mark before us is a solid starting point—but we are far from the finish line.\\" She said in the first week of October that she had not yet decided whether or not to vote for the plan. Norman Ornstein of the AEI has stated that the high cost \\"Cadillac\\" insurance plans, which would face a new tax under the Baucus plan, are more common in Maine compared to other states. Amendments and proposed amendments Sen. Charles Schumer. The amending process, known officially as the 'mark-up', began on September 22. The committee members offered 564 possible amendments, which involved a wide variety of issues. Baucus said in his opening statement, \\"[t]his is our opportunity to make history.\\" The members, collectively, spent over three hours in their opening comments. Baucus played a key role in facilitating the recent agreement between the Obama administration and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in which the group promised an $80 billion reduction in Medicare drug prices over ten years. The administration then promised in return not to make any more financial demands on the group in the future. On Sept. 25, Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) created an amendment to reverse the deal. The Committee voted 13–10 to reject the amendment. The Finance Committee also rejected, by 14–9, an amendment removing the individual mandate from the proposal. Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY) proposed the change, which he said would remove an 'un- American' requirement. Baucus labeled the amendment \\"mortally wounding\\" to the health care system set forth in the proposal. Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, who was Vice-Chairman of the Senate Democratic Conference, introduced an amendment to include a public plan in the proposal. The committee rejected his amendment on September 29, in a 13 to 10 vote. Three Democrats (Baucus, Conrad, Lincoln) and all the Republicans voted no. Schumer had said on September 24, \\"I think we have a strong chance on the Senate floor to get it.\\" Finance Committee vote On October 13, the Senate Finance Committee made their final vote on the Baucus proposal. The committee passed its bill 14 to 9. All Republicans voted no with the exception of Sen. Olympia Snowe. She later commented, \\"When history calls, history calls.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle referred to her vote as \\"a coup\\" for Baucus, coming after criticism from his fellow Democrats for making too many compromises. Snowe, as well as some moderate Democratic members of the committee, have vowed that they will drop their support for the Baucus plan if a 'public option' is added at any point. Responses Responses from other lawmakers Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), who became Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions following the death of Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA), generally praised the proposal and was reported as then becoming more \\"optimistic\\" that health care reform would pass the Congress in 2009. He also commented, however, that the co-operatives system leaves \\"a lot to be desired\\". Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), a key figure behind the rival Healthy Americans Act, expressed concern that Baucus' plan would not do enough to promote competition in the private insurance marketplace. In an official GOP weekly message in mid-October, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas argued that \\"Americans inherently know government interference drives costs up, not down.... The massive health care plans being crafted behind closed doors in Washington will ultimately allow the government to decide what doctors we can see, what treatments the government thinks you deserve and what medicines you can receive.\\" Responses from the Obama administration The day after Baucus made his proposal, President Barack Obama referred to the plan during a speech at the University of Maryland. He declined to endorse Baucus's plan directly, but he criticized the opponents of his broader goals in health care reform. The crowd of left-leaning college students booed at the mention of Baucus' proposal and cheered at Obama's other comments. Obama praised the Senate Finance Committee's vote in support of the Baucus plan on a September 13 address. He described the vote as a \\"critical milestone\\" and stated that it \\"has brought us significantly closer to achieving the core objectives I laid out\\". The President also said, \\"We are now closer than ever before to passing health care reform, but we're not there yet... Now's the time to dig in and work even harder to get things done.\\" However, according to Millier in 2019, \\"The Trump administration is working to repeal the law.\\" Other responses The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Baucus and Ranking Republican Member Chuck Grassley that labeled the proposal \\"unacceptable in many areas\\" while still \\"the most balanced health reform proposal to be marked up by Congress to date\\". The group highlighted the proposed tax on high-value insurance plans as unacceptable. Michael D. Tanner, a CATO Institute senior fellow, criticized several aspects of the proposal such as the health care materials tax, which he said \\"will result in higher health care costs that will be passed on to consumers\\", and the individual mandate, which he labeled \\"heavily punitive\\". Harold A. Schaitberger, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, stated that the proposal \\"puts a bigger tax on middle-income Americans who are already paying enough\\". Jim Hoffa, president of the Teamsters union, and Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) also expressed opposition to the health plan tax. President Barack Obama expressed support for the proposed tax, saying that \\"I do think that giving a disincentive to insurance companies to offer Cadillac plans that don't make people healthier is part of the way that we're going to bring down health care costs for everybody over the long term.\\" Republicans in the Finance Committee have called the tax a violation of Obama's campaign promise to not raise taxes on anyone earning less than $250,000 a year. The AARP has not objected to the cuts to future Medicare spending in the proposal. Charles Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, has called the proposal \\"the right thing to do.\\" The Washington Post has labeled the possible changes as \\"designed to be relatively painless\\". The National Council of La Raza opposes the measures in the proposal that require individuals to prove their citizenship status before receiving coverage. The group has created a campaign to leave Senators voice mail messages about the issue. Former CIGNA VP-turned health care activist Wendell Potter has criticized the Senate Committee for rejecting a public option. He charged that Senators are only taking their positions due to pressure from insurance industries in an interview with Amy Goodman. Howard Dean, former Democratic National Committee chairman, has remarked that \\"The Baucus bill is the worst piece of healthcare legislation I've seen in 30 years.\\" He has also said, \\"it's a $60 billion giveaway to the health insurance industry every year... It was written by healthcare lobbyists, so that's not a surprise. It's an outrage.\\" Americans United for Life (AUL), the first national pro-life organization in the US, has stated that federal taxpayer funding of abortion could still be mandated by the Baucus bill, despite claims to the contrary. AUL's CEO Dr. Charmaine Yoest stated that the bill \\"provides $6 billion for the establishment of health insurance cooperatives which would be permitted to cover abortion\\". He also said that if the Hyde Amendment is not renewed, coverage for all abortions would be mandated, under this legislation. The editors of National Review criticized the plan, arguing that \\"his proposal resorts to the same kinds of arbitrary fee cuts, taxes, and regulatory payment-control schemes that have been tried many times before and have never worked.\\" The Weekly Standard also ran an article blasting the proposal and stating that it would increase the cost of health insurance premiums through controls such as making individuals buy more comprehensive insurance than they would otherwise want.\\"Same Old Obamacare\\". By Yuval Levin. The Weekly Standard. Volume 015, Issue 04. Retrieved October 10, 2009. The Wall Street Journal editorialized that Baucus' plan, a \\"Rube Goldberg proposal\\", would eventually lead to a total government takeover of the health care industry. B'nai B'rith International and the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism both released statements praising the Senate Finance Committee after its vote in favor of the Baucus plan on October 13. The latter group stated that \\"Jewish tradition teaches that human life is of infinite value and that the preservation of life supersedes all other consideration. Providing health care is not just an obligation for the patient and the doctor, but for society as well.\\" It also referred to Maimonides' placing of health care first on his list of the ten most important communal services in Maimonides' work Mishneh Torah (Hilchot De'ot IV: 23). On October 14, journalists from Financial Times stated that \\"[t]he bill claims that it will bend the fiscal curve by reducing the rate of healthcare inflation.... Economists are sceptical on whether it will achieve this aim.\\" Shawn Tully, editor at large for Fortune, stated on Oct. 9 that the Baucus bill would provide incentives for employers not to provide insurance to its employees. She further argued that at worst the plan would add $90 billion to the CBO's original projection annually.

Hickman, and Charles Ray. It was directed by Raymond B. West and produced by Thomas H. Ince, the screenplay was written by C. Gardner Sullivan. Plot Leila Aradella (played by Glaum), a young and egotistical woman, finds pleasure from preying on weak men with her charm and beauty. John Morton (played by Hickman), a brilliant lawyer, is ruined both morally and financially by her. Rex Walden (played by Ray), the big-hearted son of a society matron, Mrs. Walden (played by Claire), then falls for Leila and proposes marriage. The family and friends of Rex, who has become her complete slave, protest his decision, believing that Leila is trouble. Mrs. Walden sends his older brother, Franklin Walden (played by Standing), to attempt to stop Leila from playing with Rex's affections. Franklin, however, falls in love with her himself. When Rex learns that Leila has left him for his brother, he is driven to commit suicide by her callous behavior. Mrs. Walden, now desperate, enlists Adele Harley (played by Temple), a girl of strong moral character, to win Franklin's affections away from Leila. Franklin is gradually drawn away from Leila and Adele's victory causes Leila to lose her confidence. In a drunken and angry state, Leila falls through a massive mirror and her face is cut by a shard of glass. After \\"marring the beauty of her face so utterly that her power to charm men is forever lost,\\" the permanently disfigured Leila ends up a broken and lonely woman. Cast *Louise Glaum as Leila Aradella *Howard C. Hickman as John Morton *Charles Ray as Rex Walden *Wyndham Standing as Franklin Walden *Gertrude Claire as Mrs. Walden *Marjory Temple as Adele Harley Production The film attracted attention for the special effect of Glaum's character falling headlong through a large mirror. One newspaper reported on the effect as follows: \\"The effect is declared to be among the most sensational ever filmed, and for that reason the director and his camera man refuse to divulge their secret. So far, in fact, is it removed from ordinary photographic trickery that it bewildered the studio folk when they saw it in the projecting room.\\" Newspaper advertisements for the film called Leila \\"a modern siren,\\" a woman who \\"regards men as her rightful prey.\\" The studio's advertising also touted C. Gardner Sullivan's script for its \\"daring disregard for the artificialities of conventional dramatic construction,\\" noting that he \\"has no mercy on the 'Wolf Woman' and crowns her career of self glorification and malicious destruction with ruin and disfigurement.\\" Sullivan said that he intended Glaum's character to be \\"a living proof of the triumph of the flesh, in whose creed the lure of the physical was placed above moral, spiritual or mental worth, and in whose incense-laden apartments the idol of sensuality replaced the crucifix or family Bible.\\" Critical reception After seeing the film, it was reported that New York critics unanimously pronounced Glaum as \\"the greatest vampire woman of all time.\\" Another reviewer noted that Glaum had become famous for her \\"vampire\\" characterizations and billed The Wolf Woman as the \\"Greatest Vampire picture of all.\\" References External links The Wolf Woman at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films * Category:1916 films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:1916 drama films ","title":"The Wolf Woman"},{"id":"24476870","text":"Fighter Squadron 3 or VF-3, was an aviation unit of the United States Navy.

He has been a columnist for the Salt Lake Tribune since 1994, focusing on the quirks of Utah and Mormon culture. Biography Kirby was born into a military family. in Barstow, California. He served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Uruguay, where he met his future wife. Salt Lake Tribune accessed 15 March 2017 On his return from Uruguay, he was hired as a police officer with the Grantsville Police Department, and later the Springville Police Department (1979). Kirby began writing columns for the local newspapers the Springville Daily Herald and Utah County Journal under the pseudonym Officer John \\"Blitz\\" Kreeg In 1989, Kirby quit the police force to write full-time. The Salt Lake Tribune has published his column since 1994, winning the 2007 Utah Headliners Award. In September 2018, Kirby was suspended from the Salt Lake Tribune for three months without pay, following an internal investigation into a social media allegations by Provo-based blogger and occasional columnist at the Tribune's rival, the LDS Church-owned Deseret News, of inappropriate behavior toward her at a Mormon conference in July. Courtney Kendrick, then 41, wrote she felt “belittled and embarrassed” after Kirby, 65, made sexually tinged comments and persuaded her to eat an edible dose of marijuana, then mocked her before a Sunstone Symposium audience by declaring Kendrick was “high.” Kirby issued a written apology stating he was \\"sorry that my actions have offended people\\" and acknowledged that there was some truth to the allegations. Subsequent statements carried a fuller acknowledgement of his responsibility and his understanding of the harmful nature, however initially unintended, of his words and actions: \\"In his own written statement, Kirby said: “I’m profoundly sorry that my actions have offended people in the community. I have a lot of work to do in understanding the pain I have caused. “After discussing my conduct with Tribune management,” he continued, “I am more aware of the consequences of my actions and I will be undergoing training and counseling to become a better person.” Writing style Kirby, who is active in the LDS Church, often writes about its teachings and how its members interpret those teachings in their daily lives. Since many of the Salt Lake Tribune's readers are non-Mormon, Kirby attempts to explain (usually in a humorous way) the Mormon way of thinking to outsiders. At one time he referred to himself as an \\"OxyMormon\\". This approach either alienates those Latter-day Saints who feel their beliefs should not be satirized, or endears itself to the reader. . . . I have come to think of [Kirby] as a rather peculiar uncle who shows up every few days to say something quirky and walks out, leaving everyone to think for a moment. I know when I see his name that I'm going to have a good morning.

The National Equality March was a national political rally that occurred October 11, 2009 in Washington, D.C. It called for equal protection for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in all matters governed by civil law in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The march was called for by activist David Mixner and implemented by Cleve Jones,Cleve Jones Joins Call for National LGBT March on Washington D.C. and organized by Equality Across America and the Courage Campaign. Kip Williams and Robin McGehee served as co-directors. Leaders like actress Michelle Clunie, Courage Campaign marketing director, Billy Pollina and New York gubernatorial aide Peter Yacobellis hosted the first fundraiser in the spring of 2009. This was the first national march in Washington, D.C. for LGBT rights since the 2000 Millennium March. Many groups joined by also organizing other events for the weekend, which coincided with National Coming Out Day on October 11 and marked eleven years since the beating and murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard, which prompted national attention and action to expand hate crime laws. Equality Across America, which is fiscally sponsored by the non-profit Tides Center, states it intends to develop a network of decentralized organizers from each of the 435 U.S. Congressional districts. History Hundreds of thousands of LGBT rights activists marched on Sunday, October 11, 2009 from the White House to the Capitol, demanding that President Barack Obama keep his promises to allow gays to serve openly in the military and work to end discrimination against LGBT people. Many organizers were outraged after the passage of California's Proposition 8, which overturned the right of gays to get married in that state, and over perceived slights by the Obama administration. Though there were no official crowd estimates, mainstream media outlets estimated as many as 200,000 people participated. Unlike the first national LGBT march in 1979 and others in 1987, 1993 and 2000 that included celebrity performances and drew as many as 500,000 people, the event was driven by grassroots efforts and was expected to be more low-key. Because organizers made extensive use of online social media tools to recruit and organize participants, the event was organized faster and more economically than those previous events. Organizers spent $156,000 to produce the event, and raised approximately $260,000. The surplus funds are being used by Equality Across America to pursue full Federal equality for LGBT people.  March route  15th Street NW closed for staging between I Street NW and M Street NW. The march began at the intersection of I Street NW and 15th Street NW and initially headed south on Vermont Avenue NW then turned right on H Street NW. The march proceeded west past Lafayette Park, south on 17th Street NW, and then east on the closed portion of Pennsylvania Avenue immediately facing the White House before turning south on 15th Street NW. Finally, the march followed Pennsylvania Avenue to the United States Capitol. Workshops There were a series of workshops, including one on tactics for repealing \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\", a law prohibiting gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces. In addition, other workshops were on \\"How to Organize on Campus\\" and \\"Adoption Option: Adoption Is an Option.\\" A \\"Transgender Community Building Caucus\\" was held.House OKs Matthew Shepard Act to protect gays, Los Angeles Times, October 8, 2009 Cleve Jones and Sherry Wolf held a workshop at Busboys and Poets café, with several hundred attending, on The Struggle for LGBT Liberation.

Andrew Austin, Thomas L. Hungerford (2010). Market Structure of the Health Insurance Industry Congressional Research Service. Library of Congress. Australia Australia's national health insurance program is known as Medicare, and is financed by general taxation including a Medicare levy on earnings; use of Medicare is not compulsory and those who purchase private health insurance get a government-funded rebate on premiums. Individuals with high annual incomes (A$70,000 in the 2008 federal budget) who do not have specified levels of private hospital coverage are subject to an additional 1% Medicare Levy Surcharge. People of average incomes and below may be eligible for subsidies to buy private insurance, but face no penalty for not buying it. Private insurers must comply with guaranteed issue and community rating requirements, but may limit coverage of pre-existing ailments for up to one year to discourage adverse selection. Japan Japan has a universal health care system that mandates all residents have health insurance, either at work or through a local community-based insurer, but does not impose penalties on individuals for not having insurance.http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/85466/E92927.pdf The Japanese health ministry \\"tightly controls the price of health care down to the smallest detail. Every two years, the doctors and the health ministry negotiate a fixed price for every procedure and every drug. That helps keep premiums to around $280 a month for the average Japanese family.\\" Insurance premiums are set by the government, with guaranteed issue and community rating.http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN020063.pdf Insurers are not allowed to deny claims or coverage, or to make profits (net revenue is carried over to the next year, and if the carryover is large, the premium goes down). Around 10% evade the compulsory insurance premium; municipal governments do not issue them insurance cards, which providers require. Voluntary private insurance is available through several sources including employers and unions to cover expenditures not covered by statutory insurance, but this accounts for only about 2% of health care spending. In practice, doctors will not deny care to patients in the low-priced universal system because they make up the great majority of patients nationwide, and doctors would not be able to earn enough by serving only the small number of patients with private insurance. Total spending is around half the American level, and taxpayers subsidize the poor.T.R. Reid (April 14, 2008). \\"Japanese Pay Less for More Health Care\\" Morning Edition (NPR). Accessed August 13, 2011. Netherlands The Netherlands has a health insurance mandateRobert E. Leu, Frans F. H. Rutten, Werner Brouwer, Pius Matter, and Christian Rütschi (January 2009). The Swiss and Dutch Health Insurance Systems: Universal Coverage and Regulated Competitive Insurance Markets The Commonwealth Fund Accessed August 14, 2011. and allows for-profit companies to compete for minimum coverage insurance plans, though there are also mutual insurers so use of a commercial for-profit insurer is not compulsory. The government regulates the insurers and operates a risk equalization mechanism to subsidize insurers that insure relatively more expensive customers. Several features hold down the level of premiums which facilitate public compliance with the mandate. The cost of health care in the Netherlands is higher than the European average but is less than in the United States. Half of the cost of insurance for adults is paid for by an income-related tax with which goes towards a subsidy of private insurance via the risk reinsurance pool operated by the regulator. The government pays the entire cost for children. Forty percent of the population is eligible for a premium subsidy. About 1.5 percent of the legal population is estimated to be uninsured. The architects of the Dutch mandate did not envision any problem with non-compliance, the initial legislation created few effective sanctions if a person does not take out insurance or pay premiums, and the government is currently developing enforcement mechanisms.Administering Health Insurance Mandates, Steuerle, C E and Van de Water, Paul N. National Academy of Social Insurance Switzerland Switzerland's system is similar to that of the Netherlands with regulated private insurance companies competing to provide the minimum necessary coverage to meet its mandate. Premiums are not linked to incomes, but the government provides subsidies to lower-class individuals to help them pay for their plans. About 40% of households received some kind of subsidy in 2004. Individuals are free to spend as much as they want for their plans and buy additional health services if desired. The system has virtual universal coverage, with about 99% of people having insurance. The laws behind the system were created in 1996. A recent issue in the country is their rising health care costs, which are higher than European averages. However, those rising costs are still a little less than the increases in the United States. United States  History  An individual mandate to purchase healthcare was initially proposed by the politically conservative Heritage Foundation in 1989 as an alternative to single-payer health care. Stuart Butler, an early supporter of the individual mandate at the Heritage Foundation, wrote: The Heritage Foundation changed its position in 2011, calling the individual mandate unconstitutional. From its inception, the idea of an individual mandate was championed by Republican politicians as a free-market approach to health care reform. Supporters included Charles Grassley, Mitt Romney, and the late John Chafee. The individual mandate was felt to resonate with conservative principles of individual responsibility, and conservative groups recognized that the healthcare market was unique. In 1993, President Bill Clinton proposed a health care reform bill which included a mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations and an individual mandate. However, the Clinton plan failed amid concerns that it was overly complex or unrealistic, and in the face of an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry. At the time, Republican Senators proposed a bill that would have required individuals, and not employers, to buy insurance, as an alternative to Clinton's plan. Hillary Clinton's plan in 2008 also included an individual mandate.  Purpose  The need for mandates to carry coverage in a system structured as currently in the U.S. arises when there is an attempt to make health insurance available to all people, regardless of their pre-existing conditions. It is a tool used when insurance companies are required to offer insurance at the same rates to all those who want it, as they are under the Affordable Care Act. The purpose of the federal or state mandates to carry coverage is to avoid free-rider problems and adverse selection problems in health insurance pools, so that there are not disproportionately many sicker people, or older people more likely to get sick, in the insurance pools. When there is excessive adverse selection, premiums can get high, or very high, and there can be so called \\"death spirals\\", where premiums rise to extreme levels, as only the sickest people are in the pools.  Massachusetts  An individual health-insurance mandate was initially enacted on a state level: the 2005 Massachusetts health care reform law. In 2006, Republican Mitt Romney, then governor of Massachusetts, signed an individual mandate into law with strong bipartisan support. In 2007, a Senate bill featuring a federal mandate, authored by Bob Bennett (R-UT) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), attracted substantial bipartisan support. Before the law was passed, per capita health care costs in Massachusetts were the highest for any part of the country except D.C. From 2003 to 2008 (three years prior and two years after enactment) Massachusetts insurance premiums continued to outpace the rest of United States, however the rate of growth year to year for Massachusetts for that period slowed as a result of the law. , more than 97 percent of Massachusetts residents were insured, which made it the state with the lowest percentage of people without health insurance. The Massachusetts state mandate to carry coverage was not stopped during the ACA, and for many years there was both a Federal and state mandate to carry coverage for MA residents. Post the stopping of the Federal mandate in 2018, the state mandate remains in place. Some have criticized the state of Massachusetts related to the mandate because post-ACA, the state has kept Medicaid estate recovery regulations broader than the federally-required-minimum (long-term-care associated expenses) so that they recover from estates all medical expenses paid on behalf of Medicaid recipients age 55 and older, including those 55 and older who get the ACA's expanded Medicaid. The criticism is that people affected are subject to having their estates need to pay back full medical expenses, not even just some kind of premium equivalent. The people affected are subject to the mandate, and would have to pay a penalty for declining the Medicaid or ACA expanded Medicaid. What could be considered unfair is that, although the mandate is for the stated purpose of allowing risk to be pooled effectively for insurance, the people subject to estate recovery of all medical expenses in fact have no risk pooling for themselves, and have to potentially pay back all medical bills paid for them. Other state individual mandates New Jersey and the District of Columbia adopted an individual healthcare insurance mandate effective January 1, 2019, and California, Rhode Island, and Vermont have done so effective January 1, 2020. Other states provide community rating and guaranteed issue without mandates.  Affordable Care Act  Romney's success in installing an individual mandate in Massachusetts was at first lauded by Republicans. During Romney's 2008 Presidential campaign, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) praised Romney's ability to \\"take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured.\\" Romney himself said of the individual mandate: \\"I'm proud of what we've done. If Massachusetts succeeds in implementing it, then that will be the model for the nation.\\" In the 2008 Presidential campaign Senator Barack Obama campaigned against an individual mandate. Obama attacked Hillary Clinton and John Edwards for their support of the individual mandate during primary debates and in television ads. However, following the adoption of an individual mandate as a central component of President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009, Republicans began to oppose the mandate. In 2009, every Republican Senator (including Bennett, who had co- written the 2007 bill featuring a mandate) voted to describe the mandate as \\"unconstitutional\\". (Explaining his opposition, Bennett later said: \\"I didn't focus on the particulars of the amendment as closely as I should have, and probably would have voted the other way if I had understood that the individual mandate was at its core. I just wanted to express my opposition to the Obama proposal at every opportunity.\\") The New York Times wrote: \\"It can be difficult to remember now, given the ferocity with which many Republicans assail it as an attack on freedom, but the provision in President Obama's health care law requiring all Americans to buy health insurance has its roots in conservative thinking.\\" Other Republican politicians who had previously supported individual mandates, including Romney and Orrin Hatch, similarly emerged as vocal critics of the mandate in Obama's legislation. Writing in The New Yorker, Ezra Klein stated that \\"the end result was... a policy that once enjoyed broad support within the Republican Party suddenly faced unified opposition.\\" The Affordable Care Act signed in 2010 by Obama included an individual mandate to take effect in 2014.See Internal Revenue Code section 5000A, . On August 30, 2013, final regulations for the individual mandate were published in the Federal Register (), with minor corrections published December 26, 2013 ().Codified at 26 C.F.R. sections 1.5000A-0 through 1.5000A-5. By the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is repealed effective 2019. On December 14, 2018, District Judge Reed O'Connor of Texas ruled that the Obamacare individual mandate was unconstitutional because [the] \\"Individual Mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power and is still impermissible under the Interstate Commerce Clause—meaning the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional.\\"  Constitutional challenges  The ACA mandate was challenged in federal courts by Republican state Attorneys General. On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the provision as Constitutional. Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the majority opinion in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, which upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by a 5-4 vote. The Court ruled that although the \\"individual mandate\\" component of the act was not constitutional under the Commerce Clause, it was reasonably construed as a tax and was therefore valid under the Congressional authority to \\"lay and collect taxes.\\" There was also disagreement as to whether federal mandates could be constitutional. In 2010, a majority of the 50 states filed litigation contending that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, and newly elected Republican governors campaigned promising to add their states to the list in 2011. The federal district courts initially split on the constitutionality issue, which ultimately was expected to reach the Supreme Court; also, state legislative actions may at least cause delay. The Militia Acts of 1792, based on the Constitution's militia clause (in addition to its affirmative authorization to raise an army and a navy), would have required every \\"free able-bodied white male citizen\\" between the ages of 18 and 45, with a few occupational exceptions, to \\"provide himself\\" a weapon and ammunition; however, it was never enforced so its constitutionality was never litigated. In 1994, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report describing an individual mandate as \\"an unprecedented form of federal action.\\" The agency also wrote, \\"The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States.\\" In a September 2010 working paper, a forthcoming article in the NYU Journal of Law and Liberty, and a lecture given at NYU, Randy Barnett of Georgetown University Law Center argues that the mandate is unconstitutional under the doctrine of the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses, and that enforcing it is equivalent to \\"commandeering the people.\\" Penalizing inaction, he argues, is only defensible when a fundamental duty of a person has been established. He also asserted that Congress fails to enforce the mandate under its taxing power because the penalty is not revenue-generating according to the Act itself. The U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the individual mandate was rendered in June 2012, in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius.  Criticism of individual mandate  Insurance lobbyists (AHIP) in the United States advocate that the mandate is necessary to support guaranteed issue and community rating, which limit underwriting by insurers; insurers propose that the mandate is intended to prevent adverse selection by ensuring healthy individuals purchase insurance and thus broaden the risk pool. The mandate has been considered at the heart of health care reform proposals in the United States and \\"absolutely necessary\\" pre-condition to universal health care, since any non-compulsory reform would fail to expand coverage. A 2008 AHIP/Kaiser forum cited Dutch and Swiss mandates (see above); AHIP's published report does not mention penalties but says Switzerland \\"enforces the rules in many ways...\\" In October 2009, Kaiser Health News reported that \\"The insurance industry is clearly worried about the mandate being defanged.\\" Some studies of empirical evidence suggest that the threat of adverse selection is exaggerated, and that risk aversion and propitious selection may balance it. For example, several US states have guaranteed issue and limits on rating, but only Massachusetts has an individual mandate; similarly, although Japan has a nominal mandate, around 10% of individuals do not comply, and there is no penalty (they simply remain uninsured - see above). Without mandates, for- profit insurers have necessarily relied on risk aversion to charge premiums over expected risks, but have been constrained by what customers are willing to pay; mandates eliminate that constraint, allowing insurers to charge more. Governments that impose a mandate must subsidize those who cannot afford it, thus shifting the cost onto taxpayers.http://www.ct.gov/sustinet/lib/sustinet/referencelibrary/sustinet_jama_re_cost_shifting_9-2-09.pdfhttp://mdpolicy.org/policyblog/detail/a-bad- exchange University of Chicago economist Casey B. Mulligan argues that, despite adverse selection, an individual mandate is unnecessary and reducing efficiency as long as insurance is subsidized enough. “Consumers who turn down the government aid by failing, say, to buy a subsidized plan are owed gratitude by us Federal taxpayers. The ACA did the opposite with its ‘individual mandate’….” A cost-benefit analysis confirming Mulligan’s argument appeared in the 2019 Economic Report of the President, which also concludes that adverse selection is not sufficient economic justification for prohibiting unsubsidized plans that exclude “essential benefits” such as coverage for maternity or mental health. The insurance mandate faced opposition across the political spectrum, from left-leaning groups such as the Green Party and other advocates of single-payer healthcare to right-leaning groups such as the Heritage Foundation, FreedomWorks, and the Cato Institute as well as some members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Opponents such as Michael Cannon, Director of Health Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, make a philosophical argument that people should have the right to live without government social interference as a matter of individual liberty. He has stated that federal, state, and local governments are not willing or able to raise the necessary funds to effectively subsidize people who cannot currently afford insurance. He has also stated that the costs of increasing coverage are far higher than other reforms, such as reducing the number of errors and accidents in treatment, which would accomplish as much or more benefit to society. Public opinion polls from 2009 through 2012 continued to find that most Americans rejected penalizing people for not buying health insurance.http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/06/09/healthcare.pdf Employer mandates In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) includes both employer and individual mandates that take effect in 2014. The PPACA's employer mandate requires that all businesses with 50 or more full-time employees provide minimum affordable health insurance to at least 95% of their full-time employees and dependents up to age 26, or pay a fee by 2016. In the two largest EU countries, France and Germany, Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) mandates employers and employees pay into statutory sickness funds. In France, private health insurance (PHI) is voluntary and used to increase the reimbursement rate from the statutory sickness system. The same applies in Germany where it is also possible to opt out of SHI if you are a very high earner and into a PHI but if a person has reached the age of 55 and is in the PHI sector he or she must remain covered by PHI and cannot opt back into SHI. Persons who are unemployed can usually continue their payments through social insurance and the very poor receive support from the government to be insured. Most workers are insured through compulsory membership of \\"sickness funds\\" that are non-profit entities established originally by trades unions and now given statutory status. In Germany and France, as is the case with most European health care finance, the personal contribution to health care financing varies according to a person's income level and not according to their health status. Only 0.2% of Germans are uninsured, mainly self-employed, rich and poor, and persons who have failed to pay contributions to the statutory insurance or premiums to the private health insurance. Between 1990 and 2000 the share of French SHI income coming directly from employees via salaries fell from around 30% to just 3% and employer direct contributions also fell. The difference was made up by a rise in income from government taxation, thus widening the mandatory contribution base to the health insurance system.http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/80703/E85472.pdfhttp://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/80694/E83126.pdf  See also  * Individual shared responsibility provision References External links * Individual Mandates for Health Insurance - Slippery Slope to National Health Care * The argument for an employer mandate Category:Health insurance Category:Health policy in the United States Category:Individual mandates ","title":"Health insurance mandate"},{"id":"24476989","text":"Shazia Manzoor (Punjabi, ) is a popular Pakistani singer.

Produced by Quai Sud Télévisions, since September 2013 is shown daily by TMC in the early evening. The presenter's mission is to help out viewers confronted with major consumer problems or with neighbours, with the help of a team of mediators, lawyers and on the spot journalists. Format The show is made up of two main parts for each problem that is treated: a reportage outlining the problem with the help of reconstructions, confrontations between the protagonists using hidden cameras, different elements of proof etc. During the second part, the presenter attempts to contact the defendants by telephone with the participation of the lawyers, negotiators and other experts, and tries amicable negotiation with them in order to find a satisfactory solution, which often leads to heated discussions. The investigation therefore often follows with telephone calls to the victim's or adversary's family, witnesses and other victims, in order to gather the most amount of evidence which are useful to challenge the \\"good faith\\" in which most of the \\"confidence tricksters\\" pretend to have acted. Once the situation is truly insoluble, or the incriminated party does not answer the telephone, the journalists attempt to contact them at their home or work in order to attempt negotiation between the two parties. In the rare cases where the affair cannot be settled immediately, the victim is invited to return to the show once the problem is finally resolved. Special dossiers Each summer, from 2006 to 2008, TF1 broadcast the \\"best of\\" the show in Les dossiers de Sans aucun doute. These special thematic episodes were shown each Friday. These dossiers were cancelled in 2009. Spin-offs The success of the show resulted in spin-offs in different formats: * Les 7 Péchés Capitaux (The 7 sins); * Les Voisins : Vont-ils se mettre d'accord ? (The neighbours: will they come to an agreement?), 45-minute show broadcast periodically early evening devoted to one sole case of problems often very sensitive between neighbours; * Le Grand Frère (the Big Brother), 45-minute show broadcast, and Les Voisins (the Neighbours), where a social centre worker, upon request by the parents, to attempt to put their children back on \\"the right track\\". These two shows are produced by the \\"La Concepteria\\", Julien Courbet's production company; * La Grande Soirée Anti- Arnaque (The big anti-scam night), formatted along the lines of a game show where the public helped by stars have to reply correctly to many series of 4 on a particular consumer subject. Reportages concerning the scandals associated with the themes covered intersperse the show where a team of lawyers give details about law to the viewers; * Voisins, vont ils se mettre d 'accord (Neighbours, will they agree) the show broadcast during primetime in January 2006 was watched by more than 7 million viewers, and came back in March to 6 million, not enough at the time for the broadcaster. Now the \\"neighbour\\" reportages and mediations are integrated into Sans aucun doute, with the journalist Hervé Pouchol. The same show is broadcast on RTL from Monday to Friday from 9:30 to 11:30 under the name Ça peut vous arriver (That can happen to you). There is also a weekly magazine \\"Stop Arnaques\\" (Stop scams) and the editor-in-chief is one of the show's team of lawyers, and a series of books, \\"Stop aux Arnaques\\" (Stop the scams), each dedicated to a particular theme. The two publications are intended to help people in difficulty to resolve their problems and inform them of their rights. Team The show uses many lawyers and journalists as experts in the affairs handled on set. With the arrival of Christophe Moulin, almost all of the team of lawyers, mediators and experts were replaced. *During September 1994 – June 2008: ** Maître Didier Bergès ** Maître Eric de Caumont, specialist in the automobile industry ** Doctor Dominique Courtois, medical consultant ** Maître Nathalie Fellonneau, lawyer ** Maître Caroline Guesdj, lawyer ** Maître Gérard Michel, lawyer at the Bar association of Nancy ** Maître Sylvie Noachovitch, criminal lawyer who left the show in April 2007 to pursue her political career ** Maître Marilyne Olivié, who replaced Sylvie Noachovitch ** Hervé Pouchol, mediator (also worked on Les 7 Péchés Capitaux) **Bernard Sabbat, consultant ** Loïc Scornec, specialist in harassment ** Timothée Vienne, journalist *From September 2008 to date: ** Ève Bartoli, journalist ** Maître Jean-Philippe Coin ** Doctor Dominique Courtois, medical consultant ** Maître Sabine Cordesse, lawyer ** Maître Denis Del-Rio, lawyer ** Joseph Elmaleh, mediator ** Maître Gérard Haas, lawyer ** Sandrine Pégand, lawyer ** Hervé Pouchol, mediator in neighbour conflicts ** Maître Isabelle Steyer, lawyer Viewer numbers Sans aucun doute was once one of the regular shows which had the largest share of the French television market, with between 40 and 55%, because of the length of the programme (2 hours 30 minutes). The number of viewers was around 2 million. Since 2007, the market share has greatly dropped to less than 30%. The first broadcast of the 2008 season with Christophe Moulin, on Friday 12 September 2008, was watched by 1.47 million viewers for a market share of 32.2%. This is considered a reasonable figure given the erosion of television channels with the arrival of TNT. The audience has remained stable since at around 35%. In February 2008 Sans aucun doute broadcast its 500th show. Broadcasts Sans aucun doute has been broadcast since 7 September 1994; initially during the second part of every Wednesday evening (September 1994 – September 1996), and since September 1995 the second part of every Friday evening.

Cremony (1815 – August 24, 1879) was an American soldier who wrote the first dictionary of the Apache language and later became a newspaperman in San Francisco. Early life Cremony was born in Boston in 1815 and claimed to have been of Cuban descent. He ran away to sea where he bore witness to piracy and the slave trade. He enlisted in the Massachusetts Volunteers in 1846 at the onset of the Mexican–American War, and served as a Spanish-language interpreter and rose to the rank of lieutenant.Soldier in the California Column, The Diary of John W. Teal, Arizona and the West, Vol. 13, No. 1 (Spring, 1971), pp. 33–82 After the war with Mexico, Cremony returned to Massachusetts and briefly worked as a newspaper reporter until 1850 when he returned to the west and served as a Spanish-language interpreter for the U.S. Boundary Commission which laid out the Mexican and United States Border between 1849–1852. When the Boundary Commission returned to the East, Cremony remained in San Diego, California and sought his fortune as a miner and prospector. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Cremony joined the California Volunteers. In 1861 as a captain in Company B, 2nd Regiment California Volunteer Cavalry a unit of California Volunteers, he arrived in the New Mexico Territory as part of the California Column. He eventually achieved the rank of major in 1864 and commanded the 1st Battalion of Native Cavalry, California Volunteers until 1866.Varner, K.(2007)John Cremony.Cypress Lawn Heritage Newsletter . 5(3)p.6 In the southwest Cremony served most of his military career in the Southwest and personally knew Apache Chiefs Mangas Coloradas and Cochise. He was the first white man to become fluent in the Apache language, learning it in his role as an interpreter, and publishing the first written compilation of their language as a glossary for the army.Geronimo (edited by Barrett) Geronimo, His Own Story New York: Ballantine Books 1971. . As a result, Cremony was often able to resolve numerous issues between the military, reservation authorities, and the Apache tribes. Not all of Cremony's discourses with the Apache were peaceful, however. He killed one warrior in a grueling knife fight and chronicled a non-stop 21-hour chase when he was pursued by a band of Sierra Blanca Apache (White Mountain Apache) for some through the desert of New Mexico while on horseback, of which were at a full gallop. Cremony authored Life Among the Apaches, published in 1869, in which he described his experiences with the tribe. Post military life After retiring from the army, Cremony settled in San Francisco, becoming a founding member of the Bohemian Club and establishing the club's membership guidelines in 1872. He was the first editor of San Francisco's Weekly Sunday Times newspaper and editor of the Commercial Herald and Market Review. Cremony died of tuberculosis on August 24, 1879Soldier in the California Column, The Diary of John W. Teal, Arizona and the West, Vol. 13, No. 1 (Spring, 1971), p. 33 and is buried at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park on the Laurel Hill Mound in San Francisco, California. Legacy Although he was one of the first Americans who could speak the Apache language, Cremony never lived among the Apache in the way the title of his book suggests. Historians of the West have come to deem many of Cremony's accounts of his Indian campaigns extravagant or embellished. The Arizona Evening Star compared his veracity to that of Baron Munchhausen, and a soldier who served under him did not \\"believe anything he says except when he says he wants whiskey.\\"Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography: A-F, p. 343.

United States Militia act The Militia Acts of 1792, based on the Constitution's militia clause (in addition to its affirmative authorization to raise an army and a navy), would have required every \\"free able-bodied white male citizen\\" between the ages of 18 and 45, with a few occupational exceptions, to \\"provide himself\\" a weapon and ammunition. (See Conscription.) The Militia Acts were never federally enforced, so their constitutionality was never litigated. Seaman relief act An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen, signed into law by President John Adams in 1798, required employers to withhold 20 cents per month from each seaman's pay and turn it over to a Collector of the Federal Treasury when in port, and authorized the President to use the money to pay for \\"the temporary relief and maintenance of sick or disabled seamen,\\" and to build hospitals to accommodate sick and disabled seamen. In 2012, Eliot Spitzer credited what he called \\"spectacular historical reporting by Professor Einer Elhauge,\\" who was employed by the campaign to re-elect President Obama, for finding 18th century legislation that Spitzer and Elhauge called individual mandates. However, as it was similar to workers' compensation, Social Security Disability Insurance, and Medicare, there exists some debate as to whether it can be properly called an individual mandate, because it did not require anyone to purchase anything themselves. Health insurance 2006 Massachusetts health care reform As part of Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's health care reform efforts, Chapter 58 of the Acts of 2006 established a system to require individuals, with a few exceptions, to obtain health insurance either through an employer or individual purchase. The penalty for not having insurance is enforced in the calculation of personal income tax. Individuals are exempt from penalty if there is no insurance plan available at a price that satisfies an affordability formula (based on income) defined by the Massachusetts Health Connector Board. Affordable Care Act In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama imposed a health insurance mandate which took effect in 2014. Under this law, insurance companies are restricted in their ability to alter insurance rates based on the current health of the individual buying the insurance. Without incentives or a mandate, healthier individuals would tend to opt out of the system, since they make fewer claims and their premiums support the claims of the less-healthy, for the time being. Insurance companies would then raise rates to make up the lost revenue. That further increases the pressure on healthier individuals to opt out of buying health insurance, which will further increase rates, until such a market collapses. Mandated insurance is intended to prevent such a downward spiral. The penalty for not having insurance that meets the minimum coverage requirements, either from an employer or by individual purchase is enforced in the calculation of personal income tax. This was the first time the federal government had enacted a mandatory purchase requirement for all residents.In 1994, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report describing an individual mandate to buy insurance as \\"an unprecedented form of federal action... The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States.\\" In 2010, a number of states joined litigation in federal court arguing that Congress did not have the power to pass this law and that the Commerce Clause power to \\"regulate\\" commerce does not include an affirmative power to compel commerce by penalizing inaction. In 2011, two of four federal appellate courts upheld the individual mandate; a third declared it unconstitutional, and a fourth said the federal Anti- Injunction Act prevents the issue from being decided until taxpayers began paying penalties in 2015. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius upheld the health insurance mandate as a valid tax under the Taxing and Spending Clause of the Constitution. In separate opinions, a majority agreed it would not be justified under the Commerce Clause, even if combined with the Necessary and Proper Clause. On , final regulations were published in the Federal Register (), with minor corrections published (). On , President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which eliminated the federal tax penalty for violating the individual mandate, starting in 2019. (In order to pass the Senate under reconciliation rules with only 50 votes, the requirement itself, at $0, is still in effect).The Effect of Eliminating the Individual Mandate Penalty and the Role of Behavioral Factors Individual mandates on the state level In 2018, as a response to the cancellation of the individual mandate penalty on the federal level, a number of states and the District of Columbia considered legislation to create state or local requirements. Massachusetts had never stopped its penalty for not carrying coverage, and maintained it post ACA, in addition to the Federal penalty associated with the ACA. After the 2018 dropping of the Federal penalty, the state penalty continues to exist in Massachusetts. As of December 2018, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia passed legislation to penalize individuals for not having health insurance starting from 2019. Vermont also passed similar legislation that would apply to years 2020 and onward. Other states that will likely consider similar measures in 2019 are Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, Minnesota, California, Washington, and Hawaii. Australia In Australia, all states and territories now have legislation that requires home and building owners to install smoke alarms. Thus, if they have not been installed, for example, in older homes and buildings, owners must procure or purchase, and install, smoke alarms.

Often described as one of the most representative Romanian critics of the interwar period, he took part in the cultural debates of the age, and, as a left-wing sympathizer who supported secularism, was involved in extended polemics with the traditionalist, far right and nationalist press venues. From early on in his career, Cioculescu was also noted for his selective approach to literary modernism and the avant-garde, preferring to place his cultural references with Neoclassicism. Acclaimed for his research into the work and biographies of writers Ion Luca Caragiale and Tudor Arghezi, and considered one of the leading experts on these subjects, he was primarily a literary columnist. Throughout his lifetime, Cioculescu worked with prominent Romanian press venues, among them Adevărul, Curentul, Dreptatea, Gazeta Literară and România Literară. Marginalized by fascist governments during World War II and persecuted by the communist regime up to the 1960s, Cioculescu later developed an ambiguous relationship with the national communist authorities, returning to the cultural mainstream and regaining his influence over the literary scene. It was during the latter interval that Cioculescu provoked several controversies, primarily by speaking out against the rebellious Onirist writers and the innovative poetry of Nichita Stănescu. Cioculescu had a complex relationship with the critics of his generation, between a lifelong friendship with Vladimir Streinu and a fluctuating rivalry with George Călinescu. He was brother to essayist, critic and victim of the communist regime Radu Cioculescu, and father to writer Barbu Cioculescu. Biography Early years As he was to recall later in life, Șerban Cioculescu was a sickly and inhibited child, who enjoyed spending his time in the family garden. Simona Cioculescu, \\"Amintirile lui Șerban Cioculescu\\", in România Literară, Nr. 24/2007 Simona Cioculescu, \\"Printre uriași\\", in Ziarul Financiar, 19 October 2007 Al. Săndulescu, \\"Mâncătorul de cărți\\", in România Literară, Nr. 11/2008 Born in Bucharest, he was the second son of engineer N. Cioculescu, and the younger brother (by one year) of Radu, who later made himself known for both his original literary works and his translations from Marcel Proust. Iulian Băicuș, \\"Marcel Proust și românii\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 70, June 2001 Both parents died when the brothers were still young children: their father in 1912, their mother in 1914. They were assigned to the care of his grandparents, who reputedly favored a severe approach to education. According to Cioculescu, although objectionable, his grandmother's stern nature ultimately contributed to fortifying his internal self, given that \\"happiness has no educational virtues.\\" Cioculescu's primary education was completed at the Schewitz-Thierrin boarding school, which left him with other similarly unpleasant memories. He later graduated from the Traian High School in Turnu Severin, a Danube port in western Romania. He subsequently attended Bucharest University's Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, where he specialized in the study of the French language. Cioculescu had among his professors critics Mihail Dragomirescu and Ovid Densusianu, comparatist Charles Drouhet, as well as historians Nicolae Iorga and Vasile Pârvan. He made himself known early on by speaking out his mind during Dragomirescu's lectures, and taking distance from his teacher's opinions.Călinescu, p.914 It was during one of Dragomirescu's classes that Cioculescu first met Vladimir Streinu, who became his best friend. He was also acquainted to and fell in love with his female colleague Maria (Mioara) Iovițoiu, whom he soon after married. Cioculescu made his press debut in 1923, when he began publishing reviews in the literary supplement of Facla, the magazine created and led by socialist writer N. D. Cocea. As he later recalled, Cocea encouraged him to pursue this activity further, telling him: \\"I believe you have the fabric of a critic.\\" Over the following years, he had numerous articles and regular columns published in several venues, including the left-wing daily Adevărul and Camil Petrescu's weekly Săptămâna Muncii Intelectuale și Artistice. He was also a frequenter of Sburătorul circle, established by his older colleague, literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu. He underwent further training in France (1926–1928), studying at the University of Paris' École Pratique des Hautes Etudes and the Collège de France. Alex. Ștefănescu, \\"Șerban Cioculescu\\", in Convorbiri Literare, August 2004 Planning to write his Ph.D. on the life and work of French man of letters Ferdinand Brunetière, he had initially applied for a state scholarship, but lost it when the state police, Siguranța Statului, having caught rumor that he held suspicious left-wing ideas, opened a file on him. Instead, he relied on money inherited from his maternal family, the Millotens, to finance both his trip and studies and provide for his pregnant wife. Their son, Barbu Cioculescu, was born before the end of their sojourn, an event which increased the family's expenses. During the same period, Cioculescu frequented other Romanian students in Paris—sociologist Mircea VulcănescuEliade (1990), p.132 and linguist Alexandru Graur. Debut Shortly after his return from Paris, Cioculescu established himself as a presence on the literary scene, and began frequenting the informal and bohemian literary club formed around Casa Capșa restaurant. One of his earliest polemics was carried with his colleague Perpessicius by means of Adevărul journal: Cioculescu found his adversary's aesthetic relativism and rejection of \\"sectarianism\\" to be incompatible with the mission of critic.Paul Cernat, Avangarda românească și complexul periferiei: primul val, Cartea Românească, Bucharest, 2007, p.316. Between 1928 and 1929, Cioculescu and Streinu were on the staff of Kalende, a literary magazine published in Pitești, Argeș County. After a short interval during which he worked as a schoolteacher in Găești town (where he was notably a contributor to the short- lived modernist review Cristalul), Dumitru Hîncu, \\"Anii '30 – O revistă 'juvenilă'... și 'matură' \\", in România Literară, Nr. 5/2007 Cioculescu entered the civil service, becoming an inspector of Romanian schools. This was the alleged start of a documented lifelong rivalry between Cioculescu and literary historian George Călinescu: the inspector reportedly chose to intervene during an Italian-language class Călinescu was giving to high school students, and managed instead to infuriate him. Between 1928 and 1937, when the newspaper was banned, Cioculescu was, with Felix Aderca and Lovinescu, one of the main literary columnists of Adevărul, writing studies on novels by Camil Petrescu, Liviu Rebreanu and Mihail Sadoveanu. Florentina Tone, \\"Scriitorii de la Adevĕrul\\" , in Adevărul, 30 December 2008 His contributions also included polemical pieces on generically cultural subjects, such as a 1929 essay on the Romanians, their process of ethnogenesis and the links with the Roman Empire (titled Latinitatea noastră, \\"Our Latinness\\"). In 1934, another one of his essays was published by the state-sponsored literary review Revista Fundațiilor Regale. It was an overview of diverse novels and novelists to have made themselves remarked during the previous year: Mircea Eliade, Gib Mihăescu, Cezar Petrescu, Gala Galaction, Constantin Stere, Ionel Teodoreanu, Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște, Damian Stănoiu and George Mihail Zamfirescu, alongside Dragomirescu, Lovinescu, Camil Petrescu, Rebreanu and Sadoveanu. Claudia Daboveanu, Valeriu Râpeanu, \\"Scriitorul periferiei românești\\", in Jurnalul Național, 28 July 2009 His earliest contribution to publishing was a 1935 volume covering the final part of Ion Luca Caragiale's life, as reflected by the correspondence between the writer and literary critic Paul Zarifopol. His interest in the 19th-century author also covered the unpublished notes of his recently deceased son, novelist Mateiu Caragiale. He studied and partly transcribed Mateiu's notes, some of which reportedly made hostile claims about his father—both the notes and a large portion of his rendition (borrowed by Cioculescu himself to Mateiu's half-sister Ecaterina) mysteriously disappeared over the following decade. Paul Cernat, \\"Spre Ion Iovan, prin Mateiu Caragiale\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 153, February 2003 Paul Cernat, \\"De la Barbu Cioculescu citire\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 319, May 2006 Cioculescu and the \\"new generation\\" controversies At the time, he also made the acquaintance of Mircea Eliade, a rebellious essayist and modernist novelist who exercised his influence over a large part of Romanian public opinion, and who called for a spiritual revolution. Literary historians Z. Ornea and Nicolae Manolescu both note that, although Cioculescu and his group were very close to Eliade in terms of chronology, the difference in attitude made them seem and be referred to as the \\"old generation\\".Ornea (1995), p.162-163 Nicolae Manolescu, \\"Mircea Eliade, 13 martie 1907 – 22 aprilie 1986\\", in România Literară, Nr. 13/2007 Cioculescu reviewed Eliade's Itinerariu spiritual (\\"Spiritual Itinerary\\") collection for Viața Literară magazine. According to Eliade himself, this was done \\"critically but with great sympathy\\", while Italian researcher Emanuela Costantini defined the entire debate as having been carried out in \\"rather tame tones\\".Emanuela Costantini, Nae Ionescu, Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran. Antiliberalismo nazionalista alla periferia d'Europa, Morlacchi Editore, Perugia, 2005, p.107. This opinion is partly shared by Manolescu, who views Cioculescu's original reaction as \\"somewhat benevolent\\", while the subsequent articles on the subject featured a more polemical nature. Cioculescu acknowledged Eliade's \\"impressive erudition\\" and status as \\"column leader\\" of a generation concerned with Romanian Orthodox spirituality and mysticism, but contended that Eliade's manner was \\"occasionally plethoric, poetically inebriating itself through abuse\\". Ion Hadârcă, \\"Mircea Eliade la începuturi\\" , in Revista Sud-Est, Nr. 1/2007 While the two figures continued to criticize each other in writing over theoretical aspects, Cioculescu admired Eliade the novelist. In 1932, the former was among the jury members granting the Editura Cultura Națională annual prize for literature, and was instrumental in assigning the distinction to Eliade's Bengal Nights novel.Eliade (1990), p.238, 249 In late autumn, he attended a session of Eliade's group Criterion, which was at the time a platform organizing public debates around intellectuals of various hues, and was admitting speakers from the far left, the far right, and various moderate fields in between. The conference, which discussed the attitudes of French novelist and Marxist essayist André Gide, was interrupted by members of the fascist and antisemitic National-Christian Defense League, who heckled the speakers and threatened them with violence.Ornea (1995), p.150, 152–153 The incident was reported by the League's newspaper Asaltul, which praised the affiliates for standing up against Gide's communism and homosexuality, and accused Cioculescu, Vulcănescu and sociologist Mihai Ralea of representing both pro-Soviet sentiment and pacifism.Ornea (1995), p.152-153 Cioculescu also offered a good review to Eliade's novel Întoarcerea din rai (\\"Return from Paradise\\"), first published in 1934. Also in 1934, Cioculescu was scandalized by the Nu (\\"No\\"), a radically voiced manifesto by Eugène Ionesco (later known as a dramatist), and, with fellow critic Tudor Vianu, voted against granting him the Editura Fundațiilor Regale prize (they were the only ones to do so).Mariano Martín Rodriguez, introduction to Eugène Ionesco, Destellos y teatro. Sclipiri și teatru, Editorial Fundamentos, Madrid, p.23-24. Reputedly, Nu had especially scandalized Cioculescu for denying the merit of Tudor Arghezi's poetry, and for defining Arghezi himself as a \\"mechanical poet\\". Nu also featured provocative remarks and allegations about critics in general and Cioculescu in particular: \\"A critic is a stupid animal. [...] The stupid man is the man to whom realities are opaque. The literary critic has to be stupid. In fortunate cases, the critic is stupid by obligation, because of professional habit, and some other times the critic is stupid by vocation. A professional with a vocation is somebody who cannot have any other profession except the one he has and who, if that profession does not exist, invents it. [Example of a] critic by professional habit: Mr. Șerban Cioculescu.\\"Eugène Ionesco, \\"About Critics\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 11/2001 Other debates of the 1930s In parallel, Cioculescu was making himself known for his resistance to the traditionalist and far right calls for state-imposed censorship, based on allegations that modernism was equatable to pornography. His defense of Arghezi's poetry and its daring themes in front of traditionalists also made him an adversary of his former teacher Iorga. In reaction, Cioculescu joined fellow literary columnists Perpessicius, Streinu and Pompiliu Constantinescu on Gruparea Criticilor Literari Români (GCLR, the Group of Romanian Literary Critics), a professional association which aimed to protect its members' reputation.Ornea (1995), p.442 The society, which also included Mihail Sebastian, Ion Biberi and Octav Șuluțiu, entered a polemic with Iorga's Cuget Clar magazine, defending Arghezi against accusations of obscenity repeatedly launched by Iorga and his journalist colleague N. Georgescu-Cocoș. However, Cioculescu himself associated modernism with pornography, and expressed his distaste for erotic literature in general. In a 1934 article, he claimed that Lady Chatterley's Lover, the controversial novel of English author D. H. Lawrence, like various works of pulp fiction translated from English, served to titillate \\"the impubescent and the perverted\\".Magda Jeanrenaud, \\"La traduction entre l'accumulation et la redistribution de capital symbolique. L'exemple des Editions Polirom\\", in Gheorghiu & Dragomir, p.212 He urged Romanian publishers to review their criteria by opting for aesthetic value in favor of commercial success. Writing for Adevărul journal in late 1936, Cioculescu reprimanded Eliade for what he perceived as inconsistency: himself repeatedly accused of being a pornographer by sections of the far right, the novelist had reacted against \\"opportunistic\\" colleagues who published erotic texts in order to commercially exploit the controversy.Eliade (1990), p.318 Contrasting his works with theirs, Eliade claimed that he had introduced \\"aggressive and savage\\" erotic scenes to his novels so as to provide \\"a vital dimension\\" to his characters. Recalling the critic's reaction to this perspective, he assessed: \\"[Cioculescu was] showing through my own example that the distinction I wanted to make between 'writers' and 'opportunists' was an impractical one. The article did not convince me.\\" By the mid-1930s, Cioculescu rallied with several initiatives associated with left politics and the cause of anti-fascism. In 1934, he declared himself favorable to the deescalation of tensions between the Soviet state and Romania (strained by the issue of Bessarabia), and signed his name to a leftist manifesto which created the Amicii URSS society (outlawed later that year by Premier Gheorghe Tătărescu).Adrian Cioroianu, ', Editura Curtea Veche, Bucharest, 2005, p.114, 116. During 1937, questioned by Azi newspaper on the issue of political censorship he stated that his beliefs were both anti-fascist and anti- communist, arguing that such phenomena could only be permitted \\"in the totalitarian state, fascist as well as communist\\".Ornea (1995), p.455 World War II Cioculescu's stances resulted in his marginalization early during World War II, when, after the fall of King Carol II's National Renaissance Front, the fascist and antisemitic Iron Guard took over (see Romania during World War II). Dumitru Caracostea, appointed by the National Legionary government as head of Revista Fundațiilor Regale suspended the contributions of critics whom he considered supporters of Jewish literature: Perpessicius, Cioculescu and Streinu. Nicoleta Sălcudeanu, \\"Generație prin lustrație\\", in Viața Românească, Nr. 12/2008 The measure raised angry comments from the anti- fascist Lovinescu, who deemed it \\"idiotic\\". Instead, Cioculescu made his living teaching French language at Bucharest's Saint Sava National College. He had among his students G. Brătescu, the future physician and medical historian, also known as a Communist Party militant after the war (before being marginalized and excluded by the group in the late 1950s). In his 2003 autobiography, Brătescu recalled that Cioculescu's method went beyond the Romanian curriculum and parallel to the National Legionary requirements, introducing his students to innovative French 19th- and 20th-century authors, from Arthur Rimbaud to Marcel Proust.Brătescu, p.79-80 Also according to Brătescu, Cioculescu introduced his students to the banned or unpublished works of Arghezi, and openly praised the poet's political stance.Brătescu, p.80, 92 In late 1940, Cioculescu also reacted to the Iron Guard's mass murders of politicians affiliated with previous regimes—the Jilava Massacre and the killings of Iorga and economist Virgil Madgearu. His Saint Sava student Brătescu, who frequented Iorga's circles in Vălenii de Munte, presented him with some of Iorga's final texts for Cuget Clar.Brătescu, p.83 These incidents came shortly before the Iron Guard's own ouster from power (the Legionary Rebellion). Cioculescu maintained a low profile during the following period, when the country was placed under an authoritarian regime presided upon by the Guard's former ally, Conducător Ion Antonescu. The period saw Cioculescu focusing on his activities as a literary historian, publisher and editor. In 1940, he published his synthesis Viața lui I. L. Caragiale (\\"The Life of I. L. Caragiale\\"). For a while, he accepted the offer made by official journalist Pamfil Șeicaru to manage the literary supplement of his Curentul newspaper. Barbu Cioculescu, \\"1944 din primăvară până în toamnă\\", in România Literară, Nr. 33/1944 The journal also published the fragments from Iorga's works in his possession. The following year, he was, with Perpessicius, Vianu and Streinu, co-author of Editura Vremea's special volume of praise for Lovinescu, who was at the time marginalized by the Antonescu regime. Mircea Iorgulescu, \\"Posteritățile lui E. Lovinescu (I)\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 698, July 2003 In 1942, Cioculescu oversaw the revised edition of Peregrinulu transelvanu (\\"The Transylvanian Pilgrim\\"), a travel account by the 19th century author and activist Ion Codru-Drăgușanu, detailing the author's impressions of England and France.Lucian Boia, Romania: Borderland of Europe, Reaktion Books, London, 2001, p.198, 314. By 1944, he was reintegrated into the corps of school inspectors by the Antonescu cabinet's Education Minister Ion Petrovici (who had also employed Streinu as his adviser). According to a rumor spread by Jewish Romanian author Sergiu Dan (and passed on by diarist Emil Dorian), the antisemitic Petrovici intended to task Cioculescu and Streinu with compiling an official history of Romanian literature to compete with George Călinescu's liberal version (the 1941 Istoria literaturii române); reportedly, the goal was to eliminate all Jewish contributions to local letters, about which Călinescu had spoken in detail.Rotman, p.176 The Cioculescu family's condemnation of official antisemitic policies and the Holocaust in Romania was however stated by Radu Cioculescu, who had witnessed and exposed murders committed by the Romanian Army on the Eastern Front.Rotman, p.95-96 In early 1944, when, as a result of Antonescu's Axis commitment, Bucharest was subject to a massive air bombardment, the Cioculescus took refuge to the southwestern periphery of Bucharest, moving into a small house in Ciorogârla. They subsequently moved into a villa owned by Șeicaru, where, as the Red Army troops entered Romanian territory; according to Barbu Cioculescu, the host and guest would debate the future of Romania in the post-fascist era—with Șeicaru expressing his hope in the Western Allies' anti-communism, and Cioculescu believing in a restoration of democracy with Soviet consent. According to the same author, Cioculescu-father was thrilled by the fall of Vichy France and ridiculed French Nazi collaborators who had escaped to Bucharest. Șeicaru left the country soon before the Royal Coup of August 1944, which aligned Romania with the Allied Powers, and the house was soon after occupied by Romanian soldiers of the Soviet-commanded Tudor Vladimirescu Division, leaving the family to move back into central Bucharest. Late 1940s and communist persecution Between 1944 and 1947, Cioculescu held a column in Dreptatea, the main press organ of the National Peasants' Party—a main representative of the opposition to the increasingly powerful Romanian Communist Party. Also in 1944, he joined Vianu and Streinu in authoring Istoria literaturii române moderne (\\"The History of Modern Romanian Literature\\"). The following year, he made his debut as a theater critic and chronicler, after accepting to collaborate with the short- lived newspaper Semnalul (published by lawyer Sebastian Șerbescu). \\"Cartea de teatru. Șerban Cioculescu, Cronici teatrale, in Ziarul Financiar, 19 June 2009 Shortly after Lovinescu's death, Cioculescu was also one of the literary professionals on the commission granting the newly established Lovinescu memorial award, presented to aspiring authors such as Ștefan Augustin Doinaș. Ștefăniță Regman, \\"Cerchiștii înainte de coborârea în Infern\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 23/2007 His next book, Introducere în opera lui Tudor Arghezi (\\"An Introduction to the Work of Tudor Arghezi\\"), was printed in 1946. Cioculescu eventually took his Ph.D. in 1945, with a monograph on Dimitrie Anghel, the early-20th-century poet and representative of Romania's Symbolist school. Ștefan Agopian, \\"La România Literară (XVI)\\", in Academia Cațavencu, 5 August 2009 Simona Cioculescu, \\"20 de ani de la moartea lui Șerban Cioculescu\\", in România Literară, Nr. 24/2008 As he himself recalled, this decision came after Dean Constantin Balmuș promised him a teaching position at the University of Iași Faculty of Letters, if he agreed to obtain the necessary qualifications within a short interval. His dissertation reviewer was Tudor Vianu, and the commission evaluating his candidature for the teaching post comprised George Călinescu, who assured him of being \\"my candidate\\". In July 1946, after earning approval from the commission, Cioculescu took over his new assignment, sharing the chair with Călinescu. The critic again found himself marginalized with the 1947–1948 establishment of the Romanian communist regime.Călinescu & Vianu, p.147Lucia Dragomir, \\"Une position marginale dans le camp littéraire roumain à l'epoque communiste: le groupe onirique\\", in Gheorghiu & Dragomir, p.262-263 Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"O carte despre Cameleonea (II)\\", in România Literară, Nr. 38/2009 As early as October 1947, he was stripped of his University of Iași position through an ex post facto decision adopted by Education Minister Ștefan Voitec (and which reputedly contradicted Romanian law). Cioculescu braved political persecution and communization, attending, with Strainu, the clandestine literary meetings organized by his fellow critic Pavel Chihaia. Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Destinul unui rezistent: Pavel Chihaia\\", in România Literară, Nr. 41/2001 During the state-endorsed supremacy of the Socialist Realist establishment, Cioculescu was targeted by communist censorship, being closely scrutinized and having his publishing privileges reduced to a minimum.Călinescu & Vianu, p.147-148 Ștefan Agopian, \\"La România Literară (XIV)\\" , in Academia Cațavencu, 22 July 2009 In a 1949 piece, communist ideologue Leonte Răutu singled out Cioculescu for his conclusion on 19th century Romanian author Mihai Eminescu, widely seen as Romania's national poet. Răutu's article, a negative review of \\"cosmopolitan\\" tendencies in local literature, reacted against Cioculescu's interpretation of Eminescu's work as a late consequence of German Romanticism. After 1954, however, Cioculescu was allowed to contribute articles for Gazeta Literară, a new magazine headed by communist figure Paul Georgescu. By 1950, Cioculescu and Streinu were attending the clandestine cultural circle formed around Barbu Slătineanu, an art historian and aristocrat.Constantin Bălăceanu-Stolnici, \\"Barbu Slătineanu, a Lover of Beauty and a Victim of Bolshevism\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 21/2004 Marius Oprea, \\"Moartea domnului Slătineanu\\", in Ziarul Financiar, 23 March 2007 According to Mircea Eliade, who was living in self-exile to Western Europe and later the United States, Cioculescu was implicated in the 1955–1956 affair that led to the communist prosecution of tens of intellectuals, among them philosopher Constantin Noica and critic Dinu Pillat. The main pieces of evidence in this case were samizdat translations of texts by Romanian diaspora authors, primarily Emil Cioran, which were circulated in the anti-communist milieus.Călinescu & Vianu, p.345 Another incriminating evidence used by the communist authorities was a clandestine translation of Eliade's own Noaptea de Sânziene novel, transported into Romania and made accessible to Cioculescu. According to Eliade, although Cioculescu \\"didn't have to suffer the consequences\\", it was he who lent a copy to Pillat, Streinu and writer Nicolae Steinhardt, all of whom were arrested and sentenced to long prison terms.Eliade (1989), p.124 Slătineanu was also among those arrested, and died a mysterious death while being investigated. When confronted with news of his friend's death, Cioculescu wrote: \\"a world is gone\\". Writer Ștefan Agopian, who met Cioculescu during the 1980s, recalled that the literary community was puzzled as to why Cioculescu himself was not arrested, and claims that his rescue was largely owed to Paul Georgescu, who secretly harbored anti- Stalinist convictions of his own. Agopian cites Georgescu saying: \\"He had done nothing wrong, so he was still usable, we could not afford to lose a guy like Cioculescu just so we could have our prisons filled. Cioculescu's luck was that the idiots upstairs listened to me.\\" However, according to the account of comparatist Matei Călinescu, who was then working for Gazeta Literară, Georgescu took personal part in censoring Cioculescu's work: in one such case, Cioculescu had written a political text on the occasion of May Day, believing that the Party was requesting a sign of loyalty from him, but unaware that authors with few political credentials were in fact barred from publishing around national holidays. Ștefan Agopian, \\"La România Literară (XV)\\" , in Academia Cațavencu, 29 July 2009 According to this account, Georgescu was infuriated by his subordinate's action, and made a point of disavowing it publicly—an attitude linked by him with Georgescu's dogmatism.Călinescu & Vianu, p.148 According to Agopian, this was nevertheless a subtle attempt to prevent Cioculescu from discrediting his name by associating it with communist messages. 1960s recuperation and later life Cioculescu's attitude and status changed radically in the 1960s. At the time, as Gazeta Literară was taken out of circulation, Cioculescu became editor in chief of Viața Românească, one of the country's oldest literary reviews.Călinescu & Vianu, p.341 Writing in 2001, critic Iulian Băicuș described the writer as a \\"convert on the Road to Damascus, which back then was passing through Moscow\\". According to historian Vladimir Tismăneanu, Cioculescu, like George Călinescu and Vladimir Streinu, was persuaded by the national communist discourse adopted by previously Stalinist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, which implied a rapprochement between the regime and the intellectuals.Vladimir Tismăneanu, Stalinism for All Seasons: A Political History of Romanian Communism, University of California Press, Berkeley, 2003, p.183. In 1961, his brother, Radu Cioculescu, was a victim of communist repression, dying as a political prisoner in Dej penitentiary. According to a testimony by fellow inmate Ion Ioanid, the last months of Radu Cioculescu's life were marked by a fall-out with his brother, probably caused by their ideological rift: he was returning packages sent by Șerban and repeatedly denying him visits. Cioculescu's prestige continued to increase during the spell of liberalization corresponding to the early rule of Gheorghiu-Dej's successor Nicolae Ceaușescu. He was granted chairmanship of the Bucharest Faculty of Letters in 1965, holding it for ten years. During the same interval, he was also assigned chairmanship of the Romanian Academy Library, overseeing some of Romania's largest collections of books. According to his student, literary historian Alex. Ștefănescu, Cioculescu established his reputation as \\"an old fashion erudite\\" among those who attended University during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and was the hero of several anecdotes popular with students. Ștefănescu argues that this was part of a larger phenomenon, which implied the recovery of interwar culture by young intellectuals: \\"For the world of communism, he miraculously personified the intellectual climate of the pre-war period. Not by accident, almost all the interviews he gave would obsessively return to questions about his advanced age, to the spiritual testament he dedicated to his followers and so on. This almost indecent inquisitiveness was explained not by the age as such, but by the feeling that the literary historian and critic belonged to another epoch.\\" Around 1967, the Ceaușescu regime convinced both Cioculescu and Streinu to travel abroad and initiate contacts with Eugène Ionesco, whom it wished to co-opt as an external backer. However, upon meeting, all three men decided to discuss purely literary matters.Liviu Țăranu, \\"Eugen Ionescu în arhivele Securității\\", in Magazin Istoric, December 2009, p.45 After a twenty-year hiatus, Cioculescu returned with a volume of essays, Varietăți critice (\\"Critical Variations\\", Editura pentru literatură, 1966) and a monograph on Caragiale (I. L. Caragiale, Editura Tineretului, 1967). They were followed by a second revised edition of Viața lui I. L. Caragiale (Editura pentru literatură, 1969). Also in 1969, Cioculescu provoked controversy by participating in the renewed condemnation of the Onirists, a faction of modernist writers who had already been persecuted for rejecting the politicization of literature and for discussing communism as an anguishing, Kafkaesque reality. According to Matei Călinescu, Cioculescu had enjoyed the earliest poetry samples of Onirist co-founder Leonid Dimov, and had intended to have them published in Viața Românească. His later anti-Onirist polemical pieces, published by the Contemporanul review and the Communist Party's official organ Scînteia, condemned the group for escapism, as well as for ignoring the \\"Marxist-Leninist view of existence\\" and \\"the natural order of things\\" by depicting psychological phenomena which, he claimed, only occurred on \\"other meridians\\" (that is, in capitalist countries). At around the same time, Cioculescu also caused a stir by rejecting the entire work of debuting poet Nichita Stănescu, whose experimental pieces had nevertheless earned endorsement at all other levels. In 1970, the critic also contributed a piece on the relationship between communist thinker Vladimir Lenin and literature, published in an anthology edited by the official figure Mihai Novicov. Several new volumes of Cioculescu's essays were published during the early 1970s. They included a 1971 book documenting his interest in French culture (Medalioane franceze, \\"French Medallions\\", Editura Univers), the 1972 Aspecte literare contemporane, 1932–1947 (\\"Contemporary Literary Aspects, 1932–1947\\", Editura Minerva).Ornea (1998), p.10 In collaboration with Editura Eminescu, he followed up with the collections Itinerar critic (\\"Critical Itinerary\\"), published by Editura Eminescu as five volumes (printed between 1973 and 1989) and a 1974 corpus of his lifelong studies on Caragiale (Caragialiana). He was made a full member of the Academy in 1974. Membri români ai Academiei: C, at the Romanian Academy site; retrieved 25 September 2009 His reception speech, a study on the life and work of Bessarabian author Teodor Vârnav, was issued as a separate volume (published by Editura Academiei) in 1975. Also in 1975, Editura Eminescu published his memoirs, Amintiri (\\"Recollections\\"), followed in 1976 by the Museum of Romanian Literature's book of interviews 13 rotonde prezidate de Șerban Cioculescu (\\"13 Round Tables Hosted by Șerban Cioculescu\\"). Retirement and final years Cioculescu retired from academia the same year, but was still a regular visitor of the Academy Library, spending much of his time in the Manuscript Section, where he verified primary sources on Romanian literature. According to Ștefănescu, he used the site as his place of meeting with envoys from various magazines, to whom he submitted his articles and reviews. It was during the 1970s that his son, by then a known literary critic and journalist, married Simona Cioculescu, a specialist in Czech literature, and, in this extended form, the family often left Bucharest and traveled into the countryside areas of Mogoșoaia or Cumpătu, where villas had been set aside by the state for the benefit of writers. In his eighties, Cioculescu withdrew to his small villa in Cotroceni neighborhood, while his activity as a cultural journalist centered on a regular column in the Romanian Writers' Union nationally circulated magazine România Literară. In summer 1978, Cioculescu and his wife were in France. It was there that the critic was reunited with his friend and rival Eliade, while negotiating with Éditions Payot the translation rights for two of Eliade's works on the history of religions.Eliade (1989), p.312 The novelist later claimed that the two of them had discussed the unexpected consequences of Bengal Nights: Cioculescu reportedly confessed having met in Romania Maitreyi Devi, the Indian poet who is believed to have inspired the work, and who is alleged to have had a physical affair with young Eliade—rumors she repeatedly denied, most notably in her own Na Hanyate book. According to this account, Maitreyi was asked by the Romanian critics and librarians to approve of a local version for Na Hanyate, but requested an unaffordable sum of American dollars in return.Eliade (1989), p.312-313 Cioculescu's published the last of his princeps edition volumes during the 1980s. In addition to Itinerarii critice, these included the 1982 Poeți români (\\"Romanian Poets\\", Editura Eminescu), as well as the 1985 collected commentary on Mihai Eminescu (Eminesciana, Editura Minerva) and similar contribution on Arghezi's career (Argheziana, Editura Eminescu). His final volume, a book of interviews, was published in 1987 as Dialoguri literare (\\"Literary Dialogues\\"). Work Context and style Cioculescu is often understood as one in a generation of prominent interwar critics who, although diverse in their views, built on the legacy of Junimea, a 19th-century literary society, and on the tenets of its leader, Titu Maiorescu. The definitions of this group vary somewhat, but definitions usually include Cioculescu, Lovinescu, Streinu, Vianu, George Călinescu, Pompiliu Constantinescu and Perpessicius.Ornea (1998), p.145, 377 Cioculescu viewed Maiorescu as a providential figure, who had prevailed over a climate of cultural chaos, but believed his skills as a critic were not outstanding.Ornea (1998), p.10, 125 Z. Ornea believes that Cioculescu and his colleagues nuanced the Junimist conservative outlook and belief in art for art's sake by borrowing from the historicism of its main left-wing adversaries, the Poporanists and socialists grouped around Viața Românească journal.Ornea (1998), p.377-378 He argued that such a synthesis was foremost illustrated by Cioculescu's affiliation with Adevărul, which maintained close relations with the Viața Românească group.Ornea (1998), p.378 Also according to Ornea, the post-Junimist group, alongside Mihail Sebastian and Octav Șuluțiu, was also the leading school of interwar critics, without whom \\"interwar literature would be hard to imagine.\\"Ornea (1995), p.438 Literary historian Sami Damian sees Cioculescu and several of the others among the \\"eminent\\" group of authors directly influenced by the older Lovinescu, opting to \\"apply a program of aesthetic independence\\".Sami Damian, \\"Sub dinastia Caragiale – un nivel al performanței\\", in Idei în Dialog, January 2009 Similarly, critic and historian Mircea Iorgulescu discussed Cioculescu as a member of Lovinescu's \\"first posterity\\". Șerban Cioculescu's own literary style was judged by Alex. Ștefănescu to represent a peak of the interwar tradition, and a link with classical mindset, characterized by calm and erudition, as well as by \\"the [...] individualism of an urban dweller with a sense of humor\\". He found its \\"pedantic and digressive style\\" similar to that of 19th-century writer Alexandru Odobescu, author of the complex essay Pseudo- cynegetikos, but noted that Cioculescu matched Odobescu's \\"reverie\\" with \\"malicious soberness.\\" In a 1989 essay, literary reviewer Ion Simuț spoke about \\"the ironic style\\" of articles and studies authored by Cioculescu, as well as by his colleagues Călinescu and Cornel Regman, and identified by him as inspired by the comediography of Ion Luca Caragiale.Mihăilescu, p.220 However, Cioculescu did not relate to criticism as an integral aspect of literature, believing that it lacked a creative dimension, and warned against the danger posed by subjectivity. Alex. Ștefănescu argued that, largely as a result of this approach and his preoccupations, Cioculescu did not produce \\"a monumental work\\", his writings being structured as summaries \\"on the margin of documents, magazine, books.\\" Citing Cioculescu's own admission that he lacked necessary \\"grain of insanity\\", he also noted that such contributions were nonetheless leading in their field of choice. A characteristic trait of Cioculescu's work was viewed by Ștefănescu as his attachment to Neoclassicism, Neoromaticism and Symbolism, with the implicit rejection of newer currents. His writings, the same commentator noted, were tied to cultural references such as Charles Baudelaire, Benedetto Croce, Victor Hugo and Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, and viewed the Comte de Lautréamont and Stéphane Mallarmé as factors of innovation. According to Simona Cioculescu, her father-in-law found a kindred spirit in French Renaissance essayist Michel de Montaigne. Ștefănescu believes that he preserved this hierarchy in assessing Romanian literature, by focusing his study on the pre-1900 age, by regarding the interwar as an unrepeatable peak, and by interpreting the avant-garde as a \\"heresy\\". In Ștefănescu's definition, this was primarily a matter of \\"taste\\", as his pronouncements on the nature of modern poetry, which aimed to defend some interwar modernists against others, were equally applicable to \\"the poetry of Nichita Stănescu, that is to say the very person whom Șerban Cioculescu considered a distasteful representative of the modernist heresy.\\" When critic Gheorghe Grigurcu argued that the positions adopted by Cioculescu in the 1960s made him a voice of the official communist-generated direction, Ștefănescu claimed the opposite: \\"There are still many proofs, among them the systematic (and, of course, unjust) rejection of the poetry written by Nichita Stănescu, an almost unanimously accepted poet, that [Cioculescu] carried on reading Romanian literature in solitude until the end of his life, refusing to become a state-appointed critic.\\" Worldview and related polemics Although Cioculescu was a prominent and constant participant in the other cultural debates of his age, he was, according to Ștefănescu, ill-suited for the purpose of representing a side, and, as a natural \\"spectator\\", would have little interest in popularizing a collective viewpoint. The same commentator also notes that this tactic was to prove the most efficient, since it replaced the \\"bull's merciless assault\\" with a \\"torero's pirouette\\". In reviewing the \\"opposition against unanimity\\" displayed by Cioculescu, Ștefănescu also argued that it proved a valuable position in itself, even at times when the critic was being proved wrong: \\"He happened to be wrong, but on principle he was right.\\" Even though their group was traditionally viewed as a monolith, the members of Cioculescu's generation often aimed their critical remarks at each other. The debate between Călinescu and Cioculescu was therefore echoed in the former's History of Romanian Literature (first edition 1941), which spoke of Cioculescu as \\"a major personality\\" with \\"an enormous capacity for literary pleasure\\", but reproached his \\"fear of commitment\\" and his \\"slowness\\" in entering cultural debates, as well as his interest in details. Ștefănescu writes that Cioculescu made a point of downplaying Călinescu's synthesis, \\"with the manifest intent of finding cracks in the marble monument\\". Călinescu also viewed his colleague's tastes as problematic, particularly in matters of poetry assessment, and claimed that such pronouncements tended to fluctuate between \\"the minimum and the maximum.\\" In his view, Cioculescu had failed to adequately understand the narrative power of works by Liviu Rebreanu (Răscoala) and Mihail Sadoveanu, and had preferred to state objections to minor aspects of their work—all while maintaining an exterior politeness which \\"promises nothing good to the victim.\\" The book also featured references to clashes between Cioculescu and various other critics of the day, noting that the former's tone \\"is very cold, but the patients are being led to the door with ceremony\\".Călinescu, p.914-915 Commenting with irony on his entry in the same volume, Cioculescu himself stated, years after his rival's death: \\"I would be an ingrate not to thank the shadow of G. Călinescu for having publicly spared me, it being more suited to him to have me destroyed 'in confidence'.\\" While subdued with time, such tension was even passed into Călinescu's evaluation of his colleague's examination for the University of Iași post, as published by Monitorul Oficial: \\"Mr. Șerban Cioculescu is a good literary historian with a slow and still sound slow course, and a critic without amplitude or major perspectives, but also lacking the extra-literary prejudice that have stained the activity of many others.\\" The verdict amused its recipient, who stated: \\"With this 'epochal' reference [...], 'warm' but vague to the nth power [...], I was appointed titular professor of modern Romanian literature\\". The main targets of Cioculescu's objections were the mysticism, traditionalism and political radicalism embraced by the right-wing or far right intellectuals in reaction to the political and cultural establishment of Greater Romania. His older colleague Lovinescu, who shared his concerns and defended the notion of liberal democracy, recognized in him an unexpectedly efficient ally: \\"people with more astute critical senses should have organized themselves long ago into a common front against the enemy that stood on the horizon [...]. They nevertheless failed to understand the danger, its concreteness, and only fought casually. More gifted in this area, Șerban Cioculescu has himself been firing a number of rifle shots and hit his target. The scattered articles against mystics and mystagogues are the finest, the only ones to transpose the fight on an ideological ground, to legitimize it.\\" Alex. Ștefănescu deemed his teacher \\"a convinced rationalist, whom neither moments of collective exultation contaminated nor the perils managed to turn into an anxious being.\\" As early as his time with Kalende, Cioculescu took the side of secularism in the debate about the specific values of Romanians, the notion of \\"Romanian spirituality\\" and the role the Romanian Orthodox Church could claim in defining them. Early on, he stated that a typical national spirituality was a \\"desideratum\\", not a historical reality.Erwin Kessler, \\"Ideas and Ideology in Interwar Romania\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 29/2007 Ornea included Cioculescu among the secularists providing a convincing reply to the Orthodox group at Gândirea magazine, and notes that, in doing so, the group also expressed support for Westernization.Ornea (1995), p.36 Early in the 1930s, Cioculescu nominated Gândirea, alongside its partners Curentul and Cuvântul, as a partisan of a dogmatic Orthodoxy \\"plagued by nullification\\". According to Ornea's assessment, Cioculescu also shared the belief that Orthodoxy could not support national specificity, since it was closely related to the global Eastern Orthodox Church, and not limited geographically to Romanian-inhabited areas.Ornea (1995), p.79, 106, 147–148 In this context, Cioculescu's main grievance against Eliade was the latter's rejection of rationalist approaches, as well as Eliade's exclusive focus on the Romanian Orthodox Church as a vehicle of Romanian spirituality. In particular, Cioculescu noted that Eliade's ideas, borrowed from his mentor Nae Ionescu, vainly attempted to transform the local Orthodoxy into a political movement, and did so by imitating the Roman Catholic Church.Ornea (1995), p.147-148 To this, he argued, were added Eliade's own eclecticism and \\"mystical spasms\\", which he believed explained why the thinker had tried to reconcile Orthodoxy with Anthroposophy, Eastern philosophy, Liberal Christianity or Urreligion. In his replies to Cioculescu's articles, Eliade explained that he neither excluded reason nor prioritized Orthodoxy, but that he believed in the importance of intuition and understood the local church as just one of several supports of a spiritual revolution.Ornea (1995), p.148 In tandem, Cioculescu also reacted against his fellow secularist, philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, who viewed Romanian spirituality as tied not to a religious institution, but to rural traditions and an immutable village—in Cioculescu's view, even this theory was proven false by the \\"rapid evolutionary process\\" which had transformed the Romanian peasantry.Z. Ornea, \\"Tradition and Modernity in the 1920s (IV)\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 29/2007 Complimenting his colleague's stance, Lovinescu listed their common adversaries as \\"Orthodoxism\\" (favoring a theocracy around the Orthodox Church), Trăirism (the existentialist school formed around Nae Ionescu), the radicalized Criterion group, and the currents which, based on theories stated by historian Vasile Pârvan, placed emphasis on the Thracians and Dacians' contribution to Romanian ethnogenesis at the detriment of Romanization. Speaking about the latter trend, Lovinescu underlined that the objective of his opponents was in overshadowing the \\"Roman background\\" of Romanian culture (see Protochronism). Cioculescu himself is also credited with having referred to such interpretations as tracomanie (\\"Thracomania\\").Mihăilescu, p.178, 203 His role in combating these phenomenons was acknowledged by Eugène Ionesco, who mentioned his former rival among the critics who preserved the \\"modernist, Westernized, rationalist\\" line from a traditionalist one which blended echoes from Iorga's Sămănătorul magazine with mystical or anti-Western messages (and whom Ionesco identified with Nae Ionescu, Vasile Pârvan, Lucian Blaga, Emil Cioran and Constantin Noica). Irina Ungureanu, \\"De la omul de teatru la 'spectacolul angajat': Eugène Ionesco față cu trădarea intelectualilor\\", in the Babeș-Bolyai University's Ephemerides, Nr. 1/2009, p.180 Main critical studies The two main subjects of Cioculescu's work were Caragiale and Arghezi, seen by Alex. Ștefănescu as his \\"elective affinities\\" (the same critic notes that the 1945 study of Dimitrie Anghel \\"was not preceded or followed by works on the same subject\\"). In Caragiale's case, Ștefănescu argued, Cioculescu proved his \\"admirable philological rigor\\", but did not produce a unitary interpretation of his subject: \\"There is not [...] a single Caragiale as seen by Șerban Cioculescu.\\" He added: \\"The finality of Șerban Cioculescu's enterprise is something other than erecting a temple, and is in effect the preservation of interest for I. L. Caragiale's work.\\" This was explicitly stated by the author, who was quoted by George Călinescu as stating: \\"[Caragiale] will indisputably find a writer of great talent to enliven his face.\\"Călinescu, p.915 According to Călinescu: \\"[Cioculescu's] contributions on the subject of Caragiale merit a perfect trust. [...] The biographical talent, which he will not attribute to himself, is nonetheless present in Șerban Cioculescu.\\" Noting that the main techniques used by his colleague were \\"insinuation\\" and \\"repetition\\", Călinescu proposed: \\"For the reader used to architecture, the effect may prove disappointing, but for the refined, especially one bored with the sublime style, the impression is relevant. All the essential characteristics of Caragiale the man are lightly touched, pinned down with needles, presented for the internal eye to see.\\" The main focus of Cioculescu's efforts regarded the recovery and publication of documents detailing the least known aspects of Caragiale's biography and literary output, an activity for which he earned the praise of his peers. He notably discussed Caragiale's political convictions, being among the exegetes who agreed that the writer lacked political ambitions, and personally demonstrating that, by the end of his life, Caragiale was disappointed with the National Liberal–Conservative two-party system.Ornea (1998), p.207-209 In addition to these tasks, Ștefănescu notes, the critic carried out polemics with Caragiale's various detractors, and produced critical commentary on the characteristics of his diverse writings and personality, as well as on those of his two sons Mateiu and Luca. Mateiu Caragiale, who, despite his hectic lifestyle and eccentricity, established himself as a novelist, was viewed with noted severity by Cioculescu—according to Ștefănescu, the researcher's take came as Mateiu was being \\"pampered by posterity\\", while reviewer Paul Cernat sees in him \\"Mateiu's most hostile critic\\". According to literary historian Eugen Simion, Cioculescu looked favorably on the post-1960 lift of communist censorship over Mateiu's work, but still found Mateiu's texts to be innately inferior to those of his father. Eugen Simion, \\"Arta marelui Mateiu...\\" , in Curentul, 29 December 2001 Cioculescu's other main interest, Arghezi's literary contribution, was the subject of many articles and essays. They pursued a lifelong literary conflict with Arghezi's opponents, responding to claims that his poems were often unintelligible, and commented at length on its \\"diversity\\" (bridging modernism and traditionalism). In one such instance, Cioculescu dismissed the claim that Arghezi's Inscripție pe un portret (\\"Inscription on a Portrait\\") was riddled with obscure meanings, by offering his interpretation and presenting the issue as soliciting one's perspicacity. Ștefănescu, who described Arghezi as \\"Don Quixote\\" to Cioculescu's \\"Sancho Panza\\", noted that the critical process resulted in the two of them switching roles, and that the critic himself largely invented the arguments against Arghezi to support his own thesis. Cioculescu's other topical interests illustrated his circumspect approach to modernism. A modernist reviewed in the 1930s by Cioculescu was novelist Camil Petrescu: commenting on Petrescu's work Ultima noapte de dragoste, întâia noapte de război, the critic joined several of his colleagues who believed the text functioned as two independent ones, a psychological novel and a war novel.Zaciu, p.111 Cioculescu viewed Petrescu's stylistic innovation as having abolished \\"the technical duality of the novel: external observation and internal analysis\\", merging such elements into a \\"dynamic psychology\\".Zaciu, p.119 During the late stages of communism, when the regime tolerated the recovery of works by Symbolist poet George Bacovia and thus caused a Bacovian fashion among young writers, Cioculescu cautioned the readers not to take their hero's contributions at face value. Eugen Lungu, \\"Bacovia: o operă în expansiune... (2)\\", in Revista Sud-Est, Nr. 3/2006 In agreement with the theories of George Călinescu, he argued that the deep pessimism which had captivated the public was essentially artificial, and, citing the recollections of Bacovia's colleague I. M. Rașcu, noted that the everyday Bacovia was a cheerful and gregarious figure. Memoirs The critic was the author of several works outside his field of expertise and themselves ascribable to literature. In addition to his memoirs and interviews, these include travel accounts detailing his vacations in Western Europe (where he followed in the footsteps of literary greats Guillaume Apollinaire and Stendhal). Amintiri, completed when Cioculescu was aged 73, details a large portion of his early life, in terms that Cioculescu himself wished plain. As in his outlook on criticism, the writer rejected the notion that his was a creative text, and indicated that he did not wish to make himself seem \\"more interesting than I really am.\\" In one section of his text, the author claimed that lyricism \\"does not agree with me\\". Nevertheless, Simona Cioculescu contends, the book was also an aesthetic revelation, which showed her father-in-law was a versed author of prose. In critic Al. Săndulescu's view: \\"The author willingly ignored his own sensitivity and artistic taste, his humor, punctuated here and there with some malicious remark, and ultimately his verve and his virtues as an expansive talker [...], in reality the virtues of a raconteur, who, contradicting his excessively self-critical opinion, often produces a literary effect.\\" He adds: \\"The memoirist enjoys and cultivates chitchat, even if he tarnishes it here and there with too many 'philologicals' and an exaggerated bibliographic exactitude.\\" In addition to his early childhood memories, which, according to Săndulescu, include a \\"micro-monograph\\" of Turnu Severin, the text comprises portraits of significant people in his life, and renditions of incidents occurring between him and various literary figures. Cioculescu looks back on his student years, describing Ovid Densusianu as a \\"short, limping man\\" who \\"did not make a great impression on first sight\\", referring to Charles Drouhet as \\"the greatest comparatist of his time\\", and recalling the stir he had caused after questioning Mihail Dragomirescu's dogmatic opinions. In one chapter, Cioculescu recalls having been one of the enthusiastic young men who voluntarily strapped themselves to the carriage taking Nicolae Iorga home for his 50th birthday of 1921. Elsewhere, he comments on the physical traits of his first employer N. D. Cocea, with \\"his roguish appearance of a bald satyr, [...] whose always unruly locks of hair by the temples resembled horns.\\" In recalling his meeting with Arghezi, Cioculescu stated having developed the same admiration as the late-19th-century youth for Eminescu, and went on to mention his \\"stunning\\" skills as a polemicist, which he believed were as good in conversation as they were in writing. The account offers short characterizations of many other writers who crossed paths with Cioculescu, including critics such as Lovinescu (who \\"had the capacity to contain his feelings and maintain his smile\\") and Alexandru Rosetti (\\"of an unsettling beauty\\" and \\"a gentleman\\"), novelists such as Camil Petrescu (depicted as a megalomaniac) and Mihail Sorbul (whose appearance reportedly made a waiter think that he was exiled Soviet politico Leo Trotsky), poets such as Ion Barbu (who did most of his work in coffeehouses), Păstorel Teodoreanu (who had memorized and could recite over 500 lines from the poetry of Paul Verlaine). Among the more unusual aspects of his memoir pieces is their frank discussion of substance abuse and drug addiction among his colleagues, in particular Ion Barbu's heavy use of narcotics, inhalants and caffeine. Andrei Oișteanu, \\"Scriitorii români și narcoticele (3). De la Emil Botta la Ion Barbu\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 949, May 2008 In his depiction of Bucharest's bohemian scene, the author also sketches the portraits of writers Alexandru Cazaban, Victor Eftimiu, Oscar Lemnaru, Adrian Maniu, Ion Minulescu, Cezar Petrescu, Liviu Rebreanu, and of actor Puiu Iancovescu. The book includes recollections of many other literary figures whom Cioculescu befriended or was acquainted with, among them Constantin Beldie, Marthe Bibesco, Lucian Blaga, Pompiliu Constantinescu, Dinu Pillat, Tudor Șoimaru and Ionel Teodoreanu. Several distinct episodes focus on the friendship between the author and Streinu. Cioculescu mentions his original encounter with the poet, which he likens to the first meeting between Caragiale (himself) and Eminescu (Streinu). He recounts that, as a result of this analogy, he began referring to his companion as \\"Făt Frumos of Teiu\\" (a pun on Streinu's native village and Eminescu's story Făt-Frumos din tei). The book discusses their common causes and their anti-fascism, but also recounts how, in private, they would frequently quarrel over literary issues: Cioculescu accused Streinu of letting his poet's mindset interfere with his critical judgment, and stood accused of being limited in recognizing the importance of metaphors. One such portion recounts Streinu's heated exchange with an Iron Guard member, allegedly occurring during the Legionary Rebellion. To the activist's claim that \\"for one thousand years, no one shall be talking about you\\", Streinu is said to have replied with irony: \\"Fine by me. They'll be talking afterward.\\" In his 2008 review of the volume, Săndulescu noted that the text omitted important details from its author's life. Given the date of completion, he describes as understandable that Cioculescu failed to mention facts about his anti- communist brother and his death in confinement, and believes it natural that the book does not include any detail about the critic's own affiliation with the anti-communist Dreptatea. However, he sees a bizarre tendency in that Amintiri skips over Cioculescu's time in Paris. Legacy In George Călinescu's assessment, Cioculescu's formal politeness and \\"maximal protocol\\", while reaching the status of an \\"individual nuance\\", was also a direct influence of Streinu. According to Paul Cernat, Șerban Cioculescu's legacy, particularly in matter of \\"inquisitive\\" style, is foremost illustrated by his son Barbu Cioculescu. He believes the fundamental difference between them is that Cioculescu-son was a noted admirer of Mateiu Caragiale, to whom he dedicated several of his texts. Cioculescu's critical work and George Călinescu's attitudes were also formative instruments for the literary essays of poet Marin Sorescu. Nicolae Manolescu, \\"Marin Sorescu (19 februarie 1936-6 decembrie 1996)\\", in România Literară, Nr. 8/2006 On his 100th birthday in 2002, Șerban Cioculescu was commemorated through festivities held at the Museum of Romanian Literature in Bucharest; the place chosen for this was a conference hall where he had presided over several writers' reunions in the 1960s and 1970s. \\"Centenar Șerban Cioculescu\\", in Adevărul, 21 September 2002 Among the many reprints of his works before and after the 1989 Revolution is a 2007 third edition of Amintiri, edited by Simona Cioculescu and accompanied by his travel writings. In 2009, she also edited a collected edition of his theater chronicles for Semnalul. Șerban Cioculescu's name was assigned to streets in Găești and Pitești, as well as to a private high school in Turnu Severin. Notes References *G. Brătescu, Ce-a fost să fie.

Dave Patton was born in 1879 and began his career using two mules to haul merchandise for local merchants. He gradually built up his own business, becoming a prominent real estate entrepreneur and contractor. He is known to have built many of the area's roads and schools. Patton died in 1927.

It was formerly the home to Sir Isaac Newton and later to the Chamberlayne family, whose descendants now own and occupy the house and surrounding park and farmland. The house and park are not generally open to the public, although open days are occasionally held. History Early years Cranbury was originally an important hamlet of Hursley, with many distinct farms and cottages, but now the name belongs only to Cranbury House and Park. The first recorded tenant of Cranbury is a Mr. Shoveller, who surrendered it to Roger Coram before 1580. Coram rented Cranbury at £17 2s per annum from the Lord of the Manor of Merdon, Sir Thomas Clarke. An incident is recorded of a dispute between Coram and Clarke regarding the rights of the tenants and the Lord of the Manor: Following the death of Coram, Sir Edward Richards held the property until the 1640s, when he let it to Dr John Young, dean of Winchester. During the Commonwealth era, when Young was expelled from the deanery, he lived in quiet retirement at Cranbury. His widow occupied the estate in 1650, and later transferred the house to Sir Charles Wyndham, who married her daughter in 1665. Sir Charles, who (like Coram before him) was noted as \\"a zealous assertor of the tenants' rights\\", was Member of Parliament for Southampton from 1679 to 1698 and for St Ives in Cornwall from 1698 to 1701. He died in 1706, although his wife survived him until 1720. A small monument was raised for them in Hursley Church. John Conduitt and Sir Isaac Newton On the death of Lady Wyndham, the house and estate were sold to John Conduitt. In May 1721, Conduitt married Catherine Barton, half-niece and adopted daughter of Sir Isaac Newton. Shortly after his marriage, Conduitt became MP for Whitchurch, Hampshire. Towards the end of his life, Newton became resident near to Otterbourne at Cranbury Park, remaining there until his death in 1727. On Newton's death, Conduitt succeeded him as Master of the Mint. In 1734, although Conduitt was re-elected to his seat at Whitchurch he chose to represent Southampton instead. Conduitt had a sundial installed in the gardens at Cranbury Park, which was calculated by Sir Isaac Newton. The sundial has been described thus: The Dummers and Lady Dance-Holland Conduitt died in 1737, leaving a daughter, Catherine, whose guardians sold Cranbury Park to Thomas Lee Dummer, who succeeded him as MP for Southampton, retaining that position for four years. In 1747, he was elected as MP for Newport on the Isle of Wight and continued to represent that town until his death in 1765. On his death, the estate was left to his son, Thomas, who also succeeded him as MP for Newport. Thomas was subsequently to become MP for Yarmouth (1769–1774), Wendover in Buckinghamshire (1775–1780) and Lymington (1780–1781). He was also elected to represent Downton in Wiltshire in 1774, but his election was declared invalid. The Castle, Cranbury Park. Built from fragments of the north transept of Netley Abbey moved to Cranbury Park in the 1760s. In 1770, Thomas purchased the City Cross (also known as the Buttercross) from the Corporation of Winchester, intending to have it re-erected at Cranbury. When his workmen arrived to dismantle the cross, they were prevented from doing so by the people of the city, who \\"organised a small riot\\" and they were forced to abandon their task. The agreement with the city was cancelled and Dummer erected a lath and plaster facsimile, which stood in the park for about sixty years before it was destroyed by the weather. Undaunted by his failure to acquire the City Cross to grace the estate, Dummer turned his attention to the ruins of Netley Abbey, which he also owned, and moved the north transept of the abbey to Cranbury Park, where it can be still be seen as a folly in the park, at . The ruins comprise an arch, the base of a pillar, and a scaled-down gateway tower. The rear of the gateway has been made into a keeper's cottage and is known to the village of Otterbourne as \\"the Castle\\" and is marked as such on the Ordnance Survey map. Thomas Dummer died without heirs in 1781, leaving his property at Cranbury and Netley and also at Horninghold in Leicestershire first to his widow, Harriet, with reversion to Thomas Chamberlayne, a member of a family with which the Dummers had been previously connected. Harriet Dummer (the daughter of Sir Cecil Bishopp, 6th Baronet) then married the artist Nathaniel Dance (later Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland, Bt), whose brother George Dance had designed the present-day house, built in 1780. Like many of his predecessors and successors, Dance-Holland was an MP serving East Grinstead in East Sussex from 1790 to 1802 and again from 1807 to his death in 1811, and Great Bedwyn from 1802 to 1806. The Chamberlayne family Dance-Holland died in 1811, but his wife survived him until 1825; on her death, William Chamberlayne, MP for Southampton, came into the property under the terms of the will of Thomas Dummer. William Chamberlayne (1760–1829) was MP for Southampton from 1818 until his death. Whilst serving the town, William Chamberlayne was also chairman of the company supplying gas lighting to the town of Southampton and donated the iron columns for the new gas street-lights, also the public baths at Northam. In 1822, the townspeople erected a memorial to William Chamberlayne in gratitude, consisting of an iron Doric column; In 2000 the column was moved to its current location in Houndwell Park. On the death of William Chamberlayne in 1829, the estate passed to his cousin Thomas Chamberlayne. Thomas (1805–1876) was a keen yachtsman who sailed his yacht, Arrow, in the inaugural America's Cup race in 1851. This race was won by the America. See \\"The Field\\" of May 1, 1886, and \\"The Graphic\\" of June 18, 1887. In 1852 The Arrow beat the famous America in the race at Ryde for the Queen's Cup. He also played cricket for Hampshire and was a great hunting and coursing enthusiast, who built both new stables and a cricket pitch at Cranbury Park. On his death in 1876 the estate passed to his son, Tankerville Chamberlayne. Tankerville Chamberlayne was also MP for Southampton from 1892 until 1896, when he was disqualified for electoral fraud in the 1895 General Election; despite this he was returned to office in 1900 until he lost his seat in 1906. It was only after his retirement from politics that Tankerville Chamberlayne took up permanent residence at Cranbury, having previously resided at his Weston Grove estate in Southampton. Chamberlayne died in 1924 and was succeeded by his son Tankerville Chamberlayne, who had married Magaret Frances Bertram in 1922. He in turn was succeeded by his only daughter Penelope Mary Alexandra Chamberlayne in 1943. She married Major Nigel Donald Peter Macdonald (son of Sir Godfrey Middleton Bosville Macdonald of the Isles (15th Baronet)), changing their surname to \\"Chamberlayne-Macdonald\\". Major Chamberlayne-Macdonald died on 15 August 2013. The family are still resident at Cranbury Park. During the Second World War, the house was briefly the base for Canadian troops prior to their embarkation for the Normandy landings. The house Cranbury House The present-day house was built in 1780 for Thomas Dummer and his wife, to the designs of George Dance the Younger.Dorothy Stroud, George Dance, Architect, 1741—1825, 1971:93-95, plates 23-2; see also Stroud in Country Life 25 October, 8 and 15 November 1956.. The house is built in red brick with stone dressings. The entrance is through a porte-cochère either side of which are large columned windows flanked by columns, set in arch-headed reserves, with roundels in relief in each tympanum and above the porch. All the other windows of both floors repeat the Venetian window motif which was added along with balustrade by Thomas Chamberlayne in the 1830s. Balustrades surmounted by urns run around the parapet, framing the whole house to give a very pleasing prospect within the landscape. Of the interior, Nikolaus Pevsner wrote that it was an \\"unforgettable experience\\" to behold the hall with its coffered tunnel-vaults to the full height of the house and the beautiful ballroom. There is a starfish vault derived from the tombs of the ancients. The main rooms are arranged around a central hall and staircase, and there is a good deal of fine plaster decoration in the William Kent style, especially in the drawing room on the south front. The ballroom designed by George Dance the younger has a circular domed ceiling. The library was designed by John Buonarotti Papworth for Thomas Chamberlayne in about 1830.Dorothy Stroud, in Country Life, 15 November 1956, noted in Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600-1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Papworth, John Buonarotti\\". Writing in 1898, John Keble described the house thus: In 1984, the house was scheduled as a Grade I listed building. The estate Scout Camp site in Cranbury Park The house stands on a hill at 85 metres above sea level and from the extensive grounds beautiful views are obtained of Southampton Water and the Isle of Wight to the south. The extensive pleasure grounds were laid out in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by John Papworth, and include fountains, a rose garden, specimen trees and pinetum, the lakeside walk and the fern walk. The folly known as \\"The Castle\\", built from material plundered from Netley Abbey, is situated in the southern corner of the park. A stream rises in the park passing through the Upper and Lower Ponds, close to The Castle. From here it passes through Hiltingbury Lake, then under Merdon Avenue in Chandler's Ford, before joining Monks Brook. Between the Upper Pond and The Castle is the campsite of the Chandler's Ford & District Scout Group.

Life Deodat van der Mont was born on or shortly before 24 September 1582 (the date of his baptism) in Sint-Truiden. His parents were Ghuilliam van der Mont, a goldsmith, and Margriet Pruynen. His family was influential locally but was not a part of the aristocracy as has been assumed by some sources. His father moved to Antwerp in 1590 after he was forced to leave the Prince-Bishopric of Liège due to accusations of money forgery.G. Baeck, \\" Mont, Deodatus van der (1582–1644), schilder en architect \\", in Nationaal biografisch woordenboek, (1970), VII 603–605 Adoration of the Magi Del Monte's life is closely connected to Rubens. According to contemporary witnesses, del Monte and Rubens were best friends from an early age. Del Monte would also have been his earliest pupil, at least in the area of painting. It is believed that he became a pupil of Rubens between 1598 (the year in which Rubens became a master) and 1600. He possibly studied under another master before becoming Rubens' pupil. Del Monte travelled with Rubens to Italy in 1600, according to some sources in Rubens' service while others state that they travelled as best friends.Hans Vlieghe. \\"Monte, Deodaat del.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 3 December 2013. The pair were together in Italy most of the time for a period of 8 years. This is evidenced by del Monte's witnessing in 1608 of a contract between Rubens and the Oratorians for the execution of an altarpiece for the San Filippo Neri church in Ferro, Italy. Immediately upon his return to Antwerp with Rubens in 1608, del Monte was registered as a 'wijnmeester' ('wine master') of the local Guild of St Luke.Deodat van der Mont at the Netherlands Institute for Art History As this is a title reserved for the sons of members of the Guild, the conclusion can be drawn that his father was or had been a member of the Guild. Del Monte joined the next year the 'sodaliteit of bejaerde jongmans', a fraternity for bachelors established by the Jesuit order. He served as the 'consulteur' of the fraternity in December 1609, 1610 and 1614. He worked as a painter and is recorded as having a workshop with two pupils in 1610. His earliest commission was for a triptych for the main altar of the Saint Benedict Church in Mortsel. This work was completed in 1612 but was later replaced by a work by Anton Goubau and is now lost. Equestrian portrait of Wolfgang Wilhelm von Pfalz-Neuburg Del Monte married Geertruyt vanden Berghe on 26 October 1614. The couple would have three sons. The early biographer Cornelis de Bie asserts in his Het Gulden Cabinet of 1662 that del Monte was in the service of Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg for some time. Some historians place this period of service in the 1610s but this is unlikely since during this time there are ample records of del Monte's presence in Antwerp. It is, however, likely that del Monte was in Wolfgang Wilhelm's service since the Count Palatine knighted him in 1626 and allowed him to have a coat-of-arms. It is further believed that he entered the service of the then governors of the Southern Netherlands, the Archdukes Albert and Isabella. He also worked as an architect and military engineer for King Philip III of Spain. The King granted him several privileges that were threatened in his later years. Cornelis de Bie alleged that the king's son Philip IV of Spain intervened on Del Monte's behalf with his brother Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, who at the time was the governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, and his privileges were restored. In his later years del Monte's financial situation deteriorated, probably because he was no longer able to work due to illness. He died in 1644, having long predicted from the stars that he would die in his 63rd year.Cornelis de Bie, Het Gulden Cabinet (Antwerp, 1661), p. 136. Del Monte's pupils included Boudewyn Claessen (1610), Thomas Morren (1610), Thomas van Bemelen (1621–22), Jakus Adriaenssen (1622–23), van den Berch (1623–24) and Martin Goes (1625–26). Work There is little information about del Monte's painterly oeuvre as only a few signed works have survived. He worked in de genres of history painting and portrait painting. In 1610 he made an altarpiece for the St Benedict church of Mortsel, which is lost. In 1614 he painted a Transfiguration for the Antwerp Cathedral which is now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp. There is a signed The Descent from the Cross (1623) in the Onze-Lieve-Vrouw Hemelvaart Church in Munsterbilzen.The Descent from the Cross in Munsterbilzen. These works show the classical plasticity that characterise the works that Rubens painted between 1612 and 1618. The four elements An Adoration of the Magi (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) has been attributed to del Monte. This work is of much higher quality than the signed works of del Monte. It possibly helps explain why he was so highly regarded in his time and why the early artist biographer Cornelis de Bie dedicated more space to del Monte than to Jacob Jordaens and Antony van Dyck. Other attributions to del Monte include a painting on The four elements (sold at Jean Moust) dated 1644, which must then have been painted in the year he was ill and died.Deodat Delmonte, The four elements at Jean Moust The still life in the composition is attributed to Osias Beert the Younger.Attributed to Deodat van der Mont and Osias Beert (II), The four elements at the Netherlands Institute for Art History A Triumph of Bacchus in India was attributed to del Monte when sold in 2000 but to Simon de Vos when sold by the same auction house Dorotheum in 2002.Attributed to Deodat van der Mont, The Triumph of Bacchus at the Netherlands Institute for Art History A drawing entitled Anointing the Dead Christ in the Fogg Museum has been attributed to del Monte.

In 1993, Galbraith moved to Los Angeles, California, where he eventually earned an M.A. from the University of Southern California's School of Cinema- Television. Galbraith's Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Films, the first English-language book about the genre, was published in 1994, and was soon followed by The Japanese Filmography. Galbraith's 1998 book Monsters Are Attacking Tokyo! The Incredible World of Japanese Fantasy Films was an oral history of the genre, told by such filmmakers as Kinji Fukasaku, Jun Fukuda, Kihachi Okamoto, and Noriaki Yuasa, and actors Mie Hama, Kumi Mizuno, and Akira Takarada. Career After graduation, Galbraith worked as an archivist for the USC-Warner Bros. Archives, and later worked at the Warner Bros. Corporate Archives before writing The Emperor and the Wolf, a joint biography of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune, and the first biography of either man published outside Japan. As with Monsters Are Attacking Tokyo!, the 800-page book featured original interviews with collaborators including Shinobu Hashimoto, Kyoko Kagawa, Takeshi Kato, Yoshiro Muraki, Masaru Sato, and Senkichi Taniguchi. After that book's publication, Galbraith returned to archive work, as a \\"film detective\\" for MGM, tracking down the original camera negatives to more than three dozen \\"lost\\" films. On DVD, Galbraith's essays have accompanied Criterion's three-disc Seven Samurai, Optimum's Rashomon, and BCI Eclipse's The Quiet Duel. He was an associate producer for the DVDs of the classic poolroom drama The Hustler and Sidney Lumet's The Verdict. He provided audio commentary (with director Richard Fleischer) for the Special Edition DVD of Tora! Tora! Tora!, and interviewed Oscar-winning cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond for his audio commentary track for The Sadist. Galbraith's audio commentary for Classic Media's Invasion of Astro-Monster was released in 2007 and nominated for a Rondo Hatton Award. Since August 2003, Galbraith has been a reviewer for the website DVD Talk, where he has published more than 1,900 reviews. Galbraith has been selected as a member of the Online Film Critics Society. Career in Japan In 2003 Galbraith moved to Kyoto, Japan, with his wife, Yukiyo Nishi. Their daughter, Sadie, was born in 2007. In addition to his work as a cinema scholar, until 2009 Galbraith published a monthly home video column for the English-language edition of the Daily Yomiuri. He also records narration and voice-over for industrial and educational films. Galbraith's The Toho Studios Story was published in 2008, and Japanese Cinema, edited by Paul Duncan, was published by Taschen in 2009.

Criticism Unusual for films of this period, the main character is not presented as a gallant Southerner who is eager to fight in the war. However, consistent with practice when the film was made, black characters were played by non-black actors in blackface. Another 1915 film, The Birth of a Nation, used whites in blackface to represent all of its major black characters, but reaction against that film's racism largely put an end to this practice in dramatic film roles, although blackface continued to be used in comedies. The acting in the film has also been noted to have been much more naturalistic than had been common in prior silent films, with cutting and camera angles aiding the actor's use of facial expressions and pauses to convey dramatic tension.

The first volume is a biography and the second a compilation of Blake's poetry, prose, artwork and illustrated manuscript. The book was largely written by Alexander Gilchrist, who had spent many years compiling the material and interviewing Blake's surviving friends. However, Gilchrist had left it incomplete at his sudden death from scarlet fever in 1861. The work was published two years later, having been completed by his widow Anne Gilchrist with help from Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti. The book became the first standard text on the Blake, a foundation of the extensive scholarship on his life and work. The original 1863 edition was subtitled \\"Pictor Ignotus\\", Latin for \\"unknown artist\\", a common phrase used for unattributed artworks. Here it refers to Blake's obscurity at the time. The phrase was taken from the recently published poem of that title by Robert Browning, part of which was used as an epigraph.\\"The sanctuary's gloom at least shall ward Vain tongues from where my pictures stand apart.\\" \\"Pictor Ignotus\\", by Robert Browning. cited in Volume 1, 1863 A second edition was published in 1880; this included additional material and revisions to the earlier transcripts of Blake's work and Gilchrist's bibliographical details. Both are referred as Gilchrist's Blake or Life. Gilchrist: Life of William Blake, 1863, title page Several of Blake's short poems, such as \\"The Tyger\\", were typeset during his lifetime and had become widely known since the author's death in 1827, having been reproduced in commonplace books by William Wordsworth and others; however, the larger corpus of his work remained in relative obscurity. The second volume, edited and annotated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, included most of Blake's songs, verse and other poetry, his prose, and letters. These were often the first publication in typeset. The editors sometimes adapted the works during transcription, printing \\"Tyger\\" as \\"Tiger\\" for the well known example, and largely excluded discussion and republication of the 'Prophetic Books'. The transcriptions included the Poetical Sketches (selections), the Songs of Innocence and of Experience, the Book of Thel, and unpublished poetry from manuscript as \\"Ideas of Good and Evil\\". Prose works include the rare Descriptive Catalogue, Blake's description of the paintings exhibited at his solo exhibition in 1809. It includes his analysis of Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, and an account of his panoramic depiction of the pilgrims leaving London. The work reproduced many of Blake's illustrations from public and private collections, interspersed throughout the biography and series of plates from his illuminated books. Many of these were engraved by William James Linton. Other designs, commentary and the second edition's cover were provided by Frederic Shields. Anne Gilchrist appended a memoir of her husband, Alexander, to the second volume. A review by James Smetham of the first edition was included in the second as an \\"Essay on Blake\\". The biography of the second edition was expanded with Blake's letters, obtained in an 1878 sale at Sothebys.

Melrose Place  When the series starts, she is married to Dr. Michael Mancini and works in a clothing boutique on Melrose Ave. In Los Angeles, Jane and Michael serve as the apartment building's superintendents as well as having separate careers. A major plot point for Jane and Michael in the first season is their inability to find time to be together and manage their busy work schedules. At the end of the season one, Jane and Michael's once happy relationship begins to crumble when Michael cheats on Jane with fellow doctor Kimberly Shaw. Jane then divorces Michael. Jane's younger sister Sydney Andrews moves into her apartment and begins to have an affair with Michael behind Jane's back. After Sydney blackmails Michael into marrying her, Jane begins dating Robert Wilson. Jane breaks up with Robert after he sleeps with a prostitute that Michael and Sydney set him up with as part of a deal. After Robert, Jane starts dating Australian businessman Chris Marchette. Chris turns out to be a con artist, and embezzles money from Jane's design business. Chris wants to marry Jane for her money, while also becoming obsessed with Sydney, wanting to use her as his concubine. Michael eventually rescues Jane from Chris after he finds about Chris' true intentions. Jane eventually becomes business partners with Richard Hart, and later becomes engaged to him. However, Jo Reynolds revealed to Richard that Jane did not truly love him, and Richard begins seeing Jo instead. This causes a rift in Jane and Jo's friendship. Jane then starts dating Jake Hanson, but ends the relationship after Richard rapes her. Planning revenge, Jane teams up with Sydney in conspiring to murder Richard, but it does not go as planned. Richard is then later killed by the police. Shortly after being robbed at gunpoint several episodes later, Jane leaves Melrose Place and moves back to her hometown of Chicago. She eventually moves back to L.A. for the final season of the show. Jane and Michael rekindle their relationship, and they marry each other for a second time. However, his old ways eventually caused her to leave him again. It is also revealed that she cheated on him the night before her first wedding to him. After divorcing Michael again, she starts a relationship with Kyle. She later finds out that she is pregnant with Michael's baby. Although Kyle knows the baby is not his, he agrees to raise the baby with her. In the series finale, Jane and Kyle are still together, and they find out they are having a girl.  Melrose Place (2009)  Jane reappears in the 2009 follow-up series as the new landlord of the Melrose apartment building. Her character in the follow-up series became a scheming, devious, crafty, and downright amoral and evil person just like all of the other characters. At the aftermath of her sister's death, Jane meets Ella Simms (Katie Cassidy), but actually threatens to show the police incriminating e-mails Ella sent Sydney unless the publicist makes her client wear one of Jane's designs, hoping to make a comeback after her boutique burned down years ago (in an arson fire, which implies, but never fully explains, that Jane may have set the fire to her own boutique to collect a fire insurance payment). Violet Foster (Ashlee Simpson-Wentz) reveals herself as Sydney's illegitimate daughter and Jane seemingly accepts Violet, but she immediately betrays Violet for no clear reason by tipping off the police of Violet's past (stealing money from her foster parents to search for her mother). Jane also goes back on her word to Ella and informs the police of Ella's incriminating e-mails. Jane returns in \\"Santa Fe\\" to check up on Amanda to make sure that Ella pays for pulling the red carpet under her. Jane and Michael reunite also with Jo.

Known as an Invisible-in-the Canal (IIC) hearing aid, the Beltone microInvisa is custom-manufactured to conform to a patient's ear canal. That allows the hearing device to sit comfortably within the ear canal, out of sight. Other popular models fall into the lightweight Behind-the-Ear (BTE) category. A very small case hides in the shadow behind the ear, and connects to the ear canal via a tiny, clear tube.

Matt was an openly gay man working as a social worker in Los Angeles. Initially Matt was not the focus of ongoing storylines, a situation that would not substantially change until the series became a serial drama in its second season. Matt Fielding appeared as a regular character from 1992 until 1997, when he was killed off-screen in a car crash. In contrast to the promiscuous sexual behaviour and relationship issues that drove the stories for Melrose's straight characters, Matt's storylines tended to be about subjects like gay bashing and workplace discrimination. Matt occasionally became romantically involved with another man but the character was never shown in any sexual situations. The one planned instance of Matt's kissing another man was edited to remove the kiss, with a reaction shot of another character substituted. Broadcaster Fox and series creator Darren Star feared backlash from social conservatives and advertisers should Matt engage in any sexual conduct. Critics questioned this decision throughout Matt's tenure on the series. Although Matt was killed, Savant expressed interest in returning for the 2009 series revival but producers were not interested.  Fictional biography  Matt Fielding is a social worker at the L.A. Halfway House for Teens, one of a group of friends who live together in the same West Hollywood apartment complex. Shortly after being gay bashed by three people, Matt is fired from his job at the halfway house for being gay. He sues the center and accepts a $10,000 settlement, which he donates to a gay legal defense fund. Michael Mancini (Thomas Calabro) helps Matt get a job as a social worker at Wilshire Memorial Hospital, a favor he makes Matt repay by faking the results of Michael's blood alcohol level test in the wake of Michael's automobile accident in which Kimberly Shaw (Marcia Cross) is critically injured and presumed dead. While working at Wilshire Memorial, Matt meets Katya Petrova (Beata Pozniak), a Russian doctor who expresses a romantic interest in him. Matt does not reciprocate her feelings, but they enter into a green card marriage so Katya and her daughter Nikki (Mara Wilson) can stay in the United States. Katya and her daughter return to Russia anyway a few months later. Matt meets Jeffrey Lindley (Jason Beghe), a closeted lieutenant in the United States Navy. Matt encourages him to come out, which leads to Jeffrey's being transferred to the East Coast. Jeffrey returns later and he and Matt resume their relationship.Miller, p. 287 A few days later, Jeffrey reveals that he has tested positive for HIV. After initially struggling, Matt decides to commit himself to the relationship. Jeffrey, however, decides they are better off simply being friends. When Matt is gay bashed a second time, a gay detective, John Rawlings (Tom Schanley), is assigned to the case and begins to become obsessive, eventually taking Matt and photographer friend Jo Reynolds (Daphne Zuniga) hostage. Following the end of his relationship with Jeffrey, Matt becomes involved with Dr. Paul Graham (David Beecroft) a married plastic surgeon. Paul murders his wife and frames Matt for the crime, temporarily landing Matt in jail. Matt clears himself by tricking Paul into admitting his guilt. Exonerated of the murder charges, Matt once again faces discrimination when the chief of staff fires him from his social work job at the hospital. Matt wins his case following the doctor's homophobic outburst at a deposition. He begins dating movie star Alan Ross (Lonnie Schuyler). Alan's refusal to come out leads Matt to take up with David Erikson, the man who replaced him as the hospital social worker. Matt and Alan break up when David tells Alan he and Matt had sex. and Alan marries a closeted lesbian actor.Miller, p. 288 Unable to keep up with his med school studies, Matt begins abusing prescription uppers (speed). When his drug addiction becomes known, he enters a rehabilitation facility and becomes romantically involved with rehab director Dan Hathaway (Greg Evigan). Matt breaks up with him because Dan is physically and emotionally abusive. Matt's niece Chelsea (Katie Wright) comes to live with him after her father dies, but her mother Denise (Nancy Lee Grahn) files a custody suit. Matt loses custody but Chelsea ends up living with him anyway when Denise decides she would be better off with him. The two move to San Francisco where Matt takes a job working with AIDS patients. About a year later, word arrives at the apartment complex that Matt has been killed in a car accident. With his death, a diary surfaces, in which Matt had recorded the secrets told him by several residents of the complex.  Development and criticism  Melrose Place was criticized for not featuring Matt and his love life as prominently as it did other characters. In the 90 minute series premiere, Matt got 90 seconds of screen time and would not appear more regularly until episode four, when he began serving as \\"the show's conscience\\", acting as a confidante to the show's heterosexual characters.Capsuto, p. 282 Several months after the series premiere, the network announced Matt's first story arc, the gay bashing arc. In response, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force representative Robert Bray said of the character, \\"I'm still waiting for the guy to have a gay identity...we're still waiting for something, anything to tell us that he's gay.\\" Series creator Darren Star, himself openly gay, acknowledged the criticism. \\"I think because [Matt] is gay, people are definitely more sensitive to the fact that we're not exploring him. My feeling from the beginning was, let's establish this character first as a person who's likable, part of this group, whose sexuality is not an issue.\\" While understanding that this aspect of the character could not remain undeveloped forever, Star expressed his hope that as people became more familiar with the character that resistance both among viewers and advertisers to Matt's having a sex life would lessen. In the 1994 episode \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\", Matt is attracted to Rob (Ty Miller) a friend of neighbor Billy Campbell's (Andrew Shue), who returns his interest. As filmed, the episode included a kiss between the two men. As aired, Matt and Rob move toward each other in slow motion and, just before their lips meet, the scene shifts to a reaction shot of a shocked Billy watching them from his apartment before cutting back to the men separating. Fox, which had previously allowed two women to kiss in a 1990 episode of 21 Jump Street, ordered the change. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, took out a full page ad in Variety a week before the episode was aired, urging Fox not to edit the kiss.Capsuto, p. 338 Fox executives were mindful of the controversy that had surrounded \\"Strangers\\", a 1989 episode of the ABC television series thirtysomething which showed two men in bed together after having had sex. The two did not come in physical contact with each other, but five of the show's regular sponsors still pulled out of the episode, costing the network approximately $1.5 million in advertising revenue.Becker, p. 138 Fox Entertainment Group president Sandy Grushow asserted that the network would have lost a million dollars in advertising revenue. \\"Our ratings aren't as high as some other networks'. We couldn't afford to take the financial hit.\\"quoted in Capsuto, p. 338 In contrast, GLAAD cited \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\", a critically and financially successful episode of the series Rosanne which included a kiss between two women. In December 1994, LGBT-interest magazine The Advocate put Matt Fielding on its cover, asking \\"Why can't this man get laid?\\" Inside, Star reiterated the difficulty in developing Matt's sexual and romantic lives. \\"The nature of television and television advertising is such that we cannot permit Matt to have real physical relationships on-screen like the other characters. We walk on eggshells in terms of telling stories about his character. So we have to find ways of implying things about his love life by creating plots for him.\\" Co- executive producer Aaron Spelling, who had faced similar fights over gay- inclusiveness in productions like Dynasty and HeartBeat, concurred, saying, \\"We've not been allowed by the sales department to do things we want to do. To not be able to show two people kissing—it's 1994, for Christ's sake.\\" Actor Doug Savant expressed frustration with the limitations placed on the role, saying \\"While I would like Matt's character to have more teeth, he's definitely a good, ethical guy. Somebody has to wear the white hat in the show, and it may as well be the gay character.\\" Nonetheless, Savant was grateful for the opportunities the role afforded him. \\"It's been an incredibly interesting trip playing a gay character. It's opened my eyes to a lot of things....The fact that I've been able to make a difference in some people's lives makes it all worthwhile.\\"  Return  According to Savant's wife and Melrose Place co-star Laura Leighton, Savant was interested in discussing the possibility of returning to the role in the 2009 series revival. However, having already brought Leighton's character Sydney Andrews back from the dead for the new series, producers were uninterested in doing the same with a second character.

In the 1970s she was one of the leading actresses of the cinemas of Hong Kong and Taiwan, particularly for her roles in wuxia films and her work with director King Hu. In 1981 she retired from her career as an actress, but a few years later she returned to the film industry as a producer and went on to produce several award-winning movies. Among them was Chen Kaige's Farewell My Concubine, which won the Palme d'Or (1993) and the BAFTA Award for Best Film not in the English Language (1994) and was nominated for an Academy Award and a César for best foreign film as well. Early life Feng was born in Taiwan. Her father was originally from Fujian and her mother from Manchuria. Her father died when she was 6 and her mother remarried. Feng later became the oldest sister of three half siblings. She got her start in film as a means of financially supporting her poor family. Feng answered a casting ad at age 15, which led to a minor role in King Hu's film Dragon Gate Inn (1967).  Career  Acting  About two years later after her small role in Dragon Gate Inn at the age of 19 she got a leading part in King Hu's classic martial arts epos A Touch of Zen (1971). She played the daughter of general Yang, who had to flee the capital after her father was murdered by assassins of the imperial eunuch Wei. Her performance was later described by the film critic Richard Corliss (Time) as the screen's gravest, most ravishing woman warrior. A Touch of Zen later also changed Hsu's outlook on films. Originally she just viewed them simply as a commercial product and means to earn living, but after traveling with King Hu to the Cannes Festival to represent A Touch of Zen, she started to regard films as an art form as well. While A Touch of Zen (1971) was still in post production, Hsu starred in another film called Ten Days in Dragon City (1969) for which she received the Golden Horse Award for Best New Performer She continued to collaborate with King Hu in a string of films. In The Fate of Lee Khan (1973), The Valiant Ones (1975) and Raining in the Mountain (1979) she was portraying martial artists again and for her role in the ghost story Legend of the Mountain (1979) she received a nomination for the Golden Horse Award for Best Actress. She won the Golden Horse Award as best actress twice for her performances in Assassin (1976) and The Pioneers (1980).  Producing  After resigning from her career as an actress in 1981 and a hiatus from the film industry in general, Hsu embarked on a career as producer. She set up her own production company Tomson Films in 1983 and specialized primarily on the production of artistic films. Among others she produced Red Dust (1990), Five Girls and a Rope (1992), Farewell, My Concubine (1993), Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker (1994) and Temptress Moon (1996). For Red Dust she received the Golden Horse Award for the best film. Farewell, My Concubine and Temptress Moon were both directed by Chen Kaige and became international successes. In particular the former received several international awards among them the Palme d'Or (1993), the Golden Globe (1993) and BAFTA (1994) Awards for best foreign film.  Other work  Hsu served as a member of the jury at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994 and at the 61st Venice International Film Festival in 2004. 2017 she was awarded a Golden Horse lifetime award for her contributions to Taiwanese cinema.Christie Chen: Actress-producer Hsu Feng to receive Golden Horse lifetime award.

It has the largest network of branches in Georgia. History Liberty Bank is the successor to the state-owned “AgroMretsvBank” which was privatised in 1994 and renamed to “People’s Bank of Georgia” in 2002. The People's Bank of Georgia had the largest customer service network in Georgia. Under the leadership of George Goguadze, the Bank opened 210 branches across the country. As Goguadze's strategy was to establish extensive coverage around the country, the Bank was able to win a state tender for the rights of issuance of pensions and other social benefits. At the end of 2008 which was the last year of Goguadze's executive operation at the JSC People's Bank, the Bank had 1.5 million clients which represent about 30% of entire Georgia's population. In September 2009 91.2% of its shares were acquired by Liberty Investments Holding B.V., a newly established joint venture of Georgia's former Prime Minister, Lado Gurgenidze and Romanian tycoon Dinu Patriciu, while the bank was renamed Liberty Bank. In 2017, Liberty Bank announced a change of control, whereby European Financial Group B.V. , a company established and organised under the laws of the Kingdom of Netherlands, purchased 74.64% of equity interest in the Bank.

The episode was written and directed by series creator and executive producer Joss Whedon, and aired in the United States on Fox on September 25, 2009. \\"Vows\\" follows the first season finale, \\"Omega\\", and takes place several months after the events of that episode. Therefore, it is set in the present as opposed to the unaired thirteenth episode, \\"Epitaph One\\". In the episode, Echo is sent on an engagement as a young woman who marries an elusive international arms dealer, played by Jamie Bamber, and Ballard is offered a position as Echo's new handler. Dr. Saunders struggles with the revelation that she is a Doll and gets some surprising revelations from Topher. A U.S. Senator starts an investigation into the Rossum Corporation. The episode was met with mostly positive reviews. Plot The episode starts with Echo getting an imprint. Paul Ballard is seemingly concerned at whether Echo can handle this, but Topher reassures Ballard everything will be fine. During the imprinting process, Topher experiences glitches with his computer and suspects it is Dr. Saunders who is messing with him and goes to sleep. Adelle and Boyd discuss the dangers of keeping Ballard on staff, but Adelle seems unfazed. Echo is then seen on an engagement and is getting married. Topher wakes up and finds that there are rats in the cupboard placed in there by Dr. Saunders. Topher calls Dr. Saunders, who accuses Topher of faulty imprinting and Topher quickly rebuffs this saying that his work is perfection and her \\"mental health\\" is her fault. Boyd then walks into the room to speak with Dr. Saunders, handing in a report about Victor and his plastic surgery to mend his scars. Dr. Saunders does speak up about how Victor was given the surgery and not her, but says she is fine with it. Boyd asks her out to dinner but Dr. Saunders declines, saying she is scared of open spaces and it is just how she was made. Boyd rebuffs this saying it is an excuse and ultimately we are all a series of excuses. Echo returns to Paul after spending the night with her \\"husband\\". It turns out Ballard is using Echo as an undercover agent to finally put the people away that he missed during his time at the FBI. Echo is then brought in for a check-up and whilst under examination by Dr. Saunders, she recalls an engagement they had together. Echo calls Dr. Saunders Whiskey and they re- account the details that sent Echo to the position of number one doll. In Adelle's office, Senator Perin is investigating the Rossum Corporation for withholding medical advancements. Boyd immediately suspects Ballard, but Ballard disregards the accusations. Adelle then offers Ballard the position of Echo's handler given how much he cares for her, despite how unhealthy it seems. Meanwhile it seems Echo has been found out. There have been photos taken of her and Paul Ballard drawing suspicion towards her. Dr. Saunders tries to seduce Topher while he is trying to sleep. Dr. Saunders hypothesizes that she was programmed to hate Topher so they would fall in love, in a sense something that is more real than a \\"love slave\\". Topher declines Dr. Saunders' sexual advances and in a heated exchange, Topher reveals that he had not programmed her to hate him. He only programmed her to disagree with him so that they would not miss \\"something\\" that could potentially hurt the dolls. The decision to hate was made only by Dr. Saunders. Dr. Saunders subsequently breaks down under this information and Topher tries to comfort her. It is revealed Dr. Saunders chose not to find out who she was in \\"Omega\\" because she doesn't want to give the body back to the original personality, thereby \\"dying\\" as Whiskey/Saunders. Echo's husband confronts Echo with the picture of her and Paul Ballard. She is struck in the head and this seemingly triggers her past imprints. As she is about to talk herself out of her situation she states that she is Eleanor Penn (from \\"Ghost\\"). She is subsequently confused about her state of mind. Echo's husband then goes to make his arms deal, bringing Echo with him. Ballard follows her and calls Topher who notices spikes in her feed and is alarmed that her handler did not call it. Ballard goes in by himself and then accuses Echo of failing the engagement and strikes her several times, trying to make her recall the \\"fighter\\" imprint from \\"Man on the Street\\". They are able to disable all the guards and stop the arms deal. Dr. Saunders leaves the Dollhouse, leaving only a note for Boyd saying \\"I'm running out of excuses\\". Victor's scars have fully healed and he and Sierra are seen holding hands walking together. Echo reveals to Ballard that she can recall her imprints, even hear them, but she knows none of them are her real self and she asks for help from Ballard. He then takes up the offer from Adelle and becomes her new handler. Production Material was filmed for this episode featuring Mag (Felicia Day), Zone (Zack Ward) and the child imprinted with Caroline's personality (Adair Tishler), set in the dystopic future of \\"Epitaph One\\". The scenes were cut because \\"Vows\\" was \\"long and crowded with information\\", but the material was eventually used, along with newly shot footage, in the series finale, \\"Epitaph Two: Return\\". Reception Reviews Hercules from Ain't It Cool News said that Vows was \\"funny, suspenseful, sexy and willing to kick around more than a few Very Big Ideas...\\" and that the episode \\"roughly triples my investment in this series' fate.\\" Eric Goldman from IGN said \\"Dollhouse definitely feels stronger now than it did in Season 1, with a more layered story going on...\\" He went on to praise the Saunders/Whiskey storyline and Amy Acker in particular, saying it \\"included some of the most emotional and complex material this show has dealt with so far, all of which is terrifically performed by Amy Acker.\\" Ratings When originally broadcast, \\"Vows\\" was viewed by 2.56 million viewers, down 41% from the series premiere, but almost on par with the first season finale, which was broadcast in May 2009. It received a 1.0/3 ratings share among adults 18-49.

The Frontier Force Regiment, Aldershot: Gale & Polden Ltd.North, REFG. (1934). The Punjab Frontier Force: A Brief Record of Their Services 1846-1924. DI Khan: Commercial Steam Press. Early history The regiment was raised on 1 January 1846 at Ludhiana as the 4th Regiment of Infantry The Frontier Brigade by Captain C Mackenzie from men transferred from the Umballa Police Battalion and the 6th and 11th Regiments of Bengal Native Infantry. In 1847, it was designated 4th Regiment of Sikh Local Infantry, becoming the 4th Regiment of Sikh Infantry in 1857. In 1851, it became part of the Punjab Irregular Force, which later became famous as the Punjab Frontier Force or The Piffers. The Piffers consisted of five regiments of cavalry, eleven regiments of infantry and five batteries of artillery besides the Corps of Guides. Their mission was to maintain order on the Punjab Frontier; a task they performed with great aplomb. In 1852, the regiment volunteered for service in the Second Burmese War 1852-53, returning to India in 1854. On the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny in 1857, the regiment marched from Abbottabad to Delhi; 560 miles in thirty days in an Indian June, going into action soon after their arrival. In 1895, it served in the Chitral Campaign. 54th Sikhs (Frontier Force) Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 54th Sikhs (Frontier Force). In 1914, the regiment's class composition was four companies of Sikhs, two of Punjabi Muslims, and one each of Pathans and Dogras. During the First World War, the regiment remained deployed on the North West Frontier of India. In 1918, it moved to Egypt to take part in the Palestine Campaign and fought in the Battle of Megiddo, which led to the annihilation of Turkish Army in Palestine. After serving in the Russian Transcaucasia and Turkey, it returned to India in 1920. In 1917, the 54th Sikhs raised a second battalion, which served in the Third Afghan War of 1919. The 2/54th Sikhs was disbanded soon after. Subsequent History After the First World War, the 54th Sikhs were grouped with the 51st, 52nd and 53rd Sikhs, and the two battalions of Guides Infantry to form the 12th Frontier Force Regiment in 1922. Soldiers of the 54th Sikhs formed part of the command of Brigadier General Reginald Dyer which fired into the crowd at the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. The 54th Sikhs became 4th Battalion (Sikhs) of the new regiment. During the Second World War, 4/12 FF served with great distinction in the Burma Campaign 2 very distinguished officers from the Battalion were Maj (Later Field Marshal) Sam Maneckshaw of the Indian Army and Maj (Later Lt Gen) Attiq ur Rahman of the Pakistan Army, both winners of the Military Cross. In 1947, the Frontier Force Regiment was allotted to Pakistan Army. In 1956, the Frontier Force Rifles and the Pathan Regiment were merged with the Frontier Force Regiment, and 4/12 FF was redesignated as 6 FF. During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, the battalion distinguished itself the advance towards Akhnur and then in the Battle of Chawinda. In 1971, 6 FF served at Sulemanki, where Major Shabbir Sharif was awarded the Nishan-i-Haider, Pakistan's highest gallantry award for valour. Maj Shabbir Shareef's brother Raheel Shareef was later Commissioned into the Battalion and rose to the rank of General and became the COS of the Pakistan Army.Attiqur Rahman, Lt Gen M. (1980). The Wardens of the Marches – A History of the Piffers 1947-71. Lahore: Wajidalis. The battalion has the distinction of having a field marshal, albeit in the Indian Army, Sam Manekshaw who was commissioned in the 4th/12th FFR in 1934, later winning a Military Cross in 1942 in the Burma campaign during World War II.

He served as consul in AD 131, alongside Marcus Antonius Rufinus, during the reign of Hadrian. Name Pontianus is not mentioned in ancient writers, and although his name occurs in a number of inscriptions, his precise nomenclature is uncertain. His praenomen is given as Marcus in an inscription from Samothrace,\\"M(arco) S(ervio) Le[na(te)] Ponti[ano]\\", . but in all other inscriptions he is either Servius or Sergius. Servius could be either a praenomen or a nomen gentilicium; both were widespread, but not particularly common. The gentile name Sergius was better known, and frequently substituted for Servius in inscriptions; this may explain why several inscriptions record Pontianus' name using the standard abbreviation for Servius,\\"Ser(gio) Octavio Laenat{a}e Pontiano\\", , \\"Ser(vius) Laena(s) Pontianu[s]\\", , \\"Ser(vi) Octavi Laenatis Pontiani\\", . Interpretations as given in the Clauss-Slaby Epigraphik-Datenbank. while in others it was apparently written Sergius.\\"[Ser](ius) Octav[ius Lae]n[as?] Pontianus\\", , \\"Serius Octavius Laenas Pontianus\\", , \\"Serg(io) Octavio Ponti[...] Felici Successo\\", NSA, 1937-6.In other inscriptions, this portion of his name is inferred; \\"S(ervio) Octavio Lenat[e]\\", , \\"[Sergio Octavio] Laen[ate] Pontiano\\", , \\"[Ser(vio) Octavi]o Laenate Pontiano\\", , \\"[Ser(vio) Octavio Laen]ate Pontiano\\", ZPE 193-249. However, the abbreviation could be used for the gentile name Servius as well as the praenomen; and further complicating matters, in imperial times it was not uncommon for members of the Roman aristocracy to possess part or all of two or more complete nomenclatures.Salway, \\"What’s in a Name?\\", pp. 131–133. Thus, it is entirely possible for Pontianus to have been named Marcus Sergius Octavius, Marcus Servius Octavius, Sergius Octavius, or Servius Octavius, in which Marcus, Servius, or both could be praenomina. A small amount of epigraphic evidence weighs in favour of Sergius in connection with the Octavia gens, which regularly used the praenomen Marcus, but not Servius. A second-century inscription from Vienna in Gallia Narbonensis mentions a Marcus Sergius Octavius, who dedicated a grave for his mother, Vennonia Iarilla; but given the location and his mother's name, it is doubtful whether he is the same man.. An undated inscription from Rome mentions a boy, Sergius Octavius Caricus, buried by his father, who is not named.. But perhaps the best indication of whether Pontianus inherited the name Servius or Sergius comes from the tomb of Nerva's mother, apparently Pontianus' great-aunt: according to the inscription, her name was \\"Sergia Plautilla\\", and she was the daughter of a Laenas, Pontianus' proavus.\\"Sergiae Laenatis f(iliae) Plautillae matri Imp(eratoris) Nervae Caesaris Aug(usti)\\", . Descent Pontianus was probably born in the late first century to an otherwise unknown Octavius Laenas; the surname Pontianus suggests that his mother may have been named Pontia. Because so little is known of his life, his historical significance is based less on his consulship, which seems to have been uneventful, and more on his descent from Tiberius, and his relationship to Nerva.Grainger, Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis, p. xiv (table 3). Besides the inscriptions mentioning his consulship, Pontianus had a monument built at Tusculum in memory of his grandmother, Rubellia Bassa, the daughter of Gaius Rubellius Blandus and Julia.\\"[Rub]elliae [Bla]ndi f(iliae) Bassae Octavi Laenatis Serius Octavius Laenas Pontianus aviae optimae\\", . Rubellia's father was from a rather obscure family, but he had been consul in AD 18. Her mother, Julia, was the daughter of Drusus Julius Caesar, the natural son of Tiberius, and Livilla, a grandniece of Augustus. Few of Pontianus' contemporaries could have claimed descent from the Julio-Claudian Dynasty. One possible exception was Sergius Rubellius Plautus, whose name has been found on a lead pipe at Rome;\\"Serg(i) Rubelli Plauti\\", . he may have been a son of Blandus and Julia, or perhaps another relative.Syme, \\"The Marriage of Rubellius Blandus\\", p. 68. In the paternal line, Pontianus was related to the emperor Nerva. The emperor's mother, Sergia Plautilla, was a sister of Gaius Octavius Laenas, consul in AD 33, and the husband of Rubellia Bassa, making Pontianus the emperor's first cousin once removed.Syme, \\"The Marriage of Rubellius Blandus\\", pp. 67, 68. Career Pontianus was consul for the first four months of AD 131, alongside Marcus Antonius Rufinus, about midway through the reign of Hadrian. The emperor was away from Rome, visiting Egypt during their consulship, which seems to have been uneventful. Although the consulship remained the chief executive magistracy, under the authority of the emperors, much of its significance—and the reason why several different pairs of consuls shared the office each year—was to prepare able administrators to hold provincial governorships and other important positions throughout the empire. But while Pontianus probably held a variety of magistracies and other appointments before and after the consulship, none of the inscriptions mentioning him give any details of his career, except that he seems to have been a member of the College of Pontiffs.\\"[Ser](ius) Octav[ius Lae]n[as(?)] [P]ontianus pont(ifex) pec(unia) pub(lica) fac(iendum) cur(avit)\\", .

The architects of the award-winning high-tech building were the Richard Rogers Partnership. Construction began in 1980 and was completed by 1982. The factory was the first building to be designed by Richard Rogers in Wales. Later, he would design the Senedd building in Cardiff, which is the debating chamber for the National Assembly for Wales. Design and construction Inmos Ltd commissioned the Richard Rogers Partnership, now known as Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, to design its UK microprocessor manufacturing facility at Newport. The design criterion was for a fast construction, so that it was ready for operation within one year of starting. Richard Rogers until then was known for designing the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Lloyd's building in London. The main contractor for the construction of the building was Laing Construction, the structural engineers were Anthony Hunt Associates, the services engineers were YRM Engineers and the quantity surveyors were GA Hanscomb Partnership. The technical requirements were that it would house controlled conditions for the production of electronic microchips, a service area for various offices and a staff canteen, all under one roof. The Inmos factory was designed to be a model factory that could be constructed in a variety of locations. The speed of the design process and construction time of the building were critical. The single-storey building was designed to be fabricated off-site, and assembled on the Newport site. The building is divided into clean and \\"dirty\\" areas. The cleanroom being for microchip production and the dirty area for all others services in the building. The building has a central spine which is wide and from which all the services and production area emanates from eight bays with the potential to increase this to 20 bays. Suspended beams span 40m from the central spine with masts along the length of the building allowing for a post- free area, and so providing a flexible interior and the possibility of large work areas. Reyner Banham, the architectural critic and writer, said of the Inmos factory that it was \\"the first really challenging building of the 1980s.\\" Usage Although the building was commissioned by Inmos for their use, by July 1984 Thorn EMI had taken over Inmos. Thorn EMI later sold Inmos to SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV in March 1989. A management buyout took over the factory in 1999, renaming the business, European Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited. In March 2002, the factory was sold to International Rectifier Company (GB) Limited, who are the present day owners of the site.

The band comprised two key members: Christopher Owens, songwriter and lead singer, and Chet \\"JR\\" White, who played bass and produced. Girls' sound was heavily inspired by the music of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, with their sound being described as lo-fi, surf rock, rock and roll, psychedelic rock, pop rock, country rock, and garage rock. Girls' debut full-length, Album, was released in 2009 to critical acclaim. Its 2011 follow-up, Father, Son, Holy Ghost, was also well received. On July 2, 2012, Owens announced that he was leaving the band and would continue to record as a solo artist. History Formation and Album (2007–09) Owens was born into the fundamentalist cult Children of God, but absconded at the age of sixteen from their community in Slovenia to Amarillo, Texas. It took him years of exploring common technology, hardcore punk and nihilism, among other things, to cope in mainstream society. He began busking, which gave him an outlet and contact with the outside world. In an interview with Exclaim! magazine, Owens related much of how being part of the Children of God cult informed his childhood and his music. While there, he was not allowed to listen to music from outside the group, but was allowed to watch films from which he absorbed music like Queen and Guns N' Roses. In Amarillo, Owens was taken in by Stanley Marsh 3, working as his personal assistant for four years. When Owens turned 25, he moved to San Francisco, where he started making music and taking drugs such as cocaine and heroin. While in California, Owens became a member of Holy Shit with Ariel Pink and Matt Fishbeck. Owens then met Chet \\"JR\\" White, a Bay Area native who was raised in Santa Cruz, California, who began recording bands in his parents' garage in his teens. Upon meeting, the two developed a strong bond and interest in similar music, as well as a shared background in punk/hardcore music. Shortly thereafter, Owens and White started recording what was to later be their debut album, titled Album. Album received critical acclaim when it was released. Pitchfork rated the single \\"Hellhole Ratrace\\" at 383 of the top 500 songs of the 2000s. The same website gave the album a grade of 9.1/10 and was rated the 10th best album of 2009. Father, Son, Holy Ghost (2010–2011) In 2010, Girls released the EP Broken Dreams Club, an EP Owens described as \\"a taste of things to come.\\" On July 20, 2011, they released the song \\"Vomit\\" from their upcoming album as a free download. This was followed by a video of the same song in August. \\"Honey Bunny\\" was the second cut off the record. The band released their second full-length album Father, Son, Holy Ghost on September 9, 2011 in UK/Europe and on September 13 in the USA. In November 2011, Girls announced a standalone single, \\"Lawrence\\", released on heart-shaped vinyl on November 28, 2011; The song was written as a tribute to Felt lead singer Lawrence. Coachella. Like Album, Father, Son, Holy Ghost received much acclaim. \\"Vomit\\" and \\"Honey Bunny\\", the first and second single from the album, received \\"Best New Music\\" designations from Pitchfork. The same website gave the album a grade of 9.3 and was ranked number five on their Top 50 Albums of 2011 list. Billboard said \\"with Father, Son, Holy Ghost the band has vaulted the equivalent of three albums ahead, taking the conciseness of the EP and confounding expectations.\\" Spin gave the album a 9/10 rating, saying \\"with Father, Son, Holy Ghost's exquisite, beyond-indie melodies, arrangements, and musicianship (the playful \\"Magic,\\" the elegant \\"Just a Song,\\" the fiery \\"Die\\"), (Christopher Owens) and bassist-producer JR White flirt with perfection.\\" The songs on the album deal with love and Owens' drug addiction; Owens stated that he needed to detox prior to tours in order to make it through them. Father, Son, Holy Ghost brought even more exposure to the band. The album peaked at no. 37 on the Billboard 200. On the tour in support of the album, the band performed at the St Jerome's Laneway Festival and the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. In addition, the band performed songs from the album on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Conan. Breakup (2012) On July 1, 2012, Christopher Owens announced via his Twitter feed that he was leaving the band though he will continue to record music on his own. Owens cited the band's constantly shifting lineup as the reason for his departure, saying in an interview with Pitchfork: \\"[W]e were replacing members for every other tour; I didn't feel like I had other people who were maturing alongside me. I counted out the amount of people that were in the band over the years. It was 21 – a giant amount of people. That's feeling disappointed 21 times over.\\" The breaking point for Owens came when guitarist John Anderson, one of Owens' closest friends, left the band. In a March 2013 Paste magazine article, Chet \\"JR\\" White talked to writer Philip Cosores. After the band's disbandment, White denied all requests for interviews. White told Corsores there was an initial shock after reading Owens' email and tweets about the band's breakup; but after they spoke less during the Father, Son, Holy Ghost sessions, he \\"knew it [the breakup] could be coming soon\\". Owens released his debut solo album Lysandre on January 15, 2013. He followed this up with A New Testament in September 2014. Owen's has since voiced his displeasure over the bands shared name with the HBO series Girls. Musical style Girls were heavily influenced by the music of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, with their sound being described as lo-fi, surf rock, rock and roll, psychedelic rock, pop rock, country rock, and garage rock. For the band's first album Album, critics identified The Beach Boys, Elvis Costello, Buddy Holly, Spiritualized, Galaxie 500, Felt, and Ariel Pink as possible influences. The band's second album, Father, Son, Holy Ghost, kept most of the surf rock sound of the first album, but also saw their sound expand into metal and gospel music.

Works He has made concert music pieces, works with video, and installations with acoustic instruments and, in some recent pieces, computer- generated electronics, drawing inspiration from investigations of the sounding and perception of small number relations (Just Intonation), American folk and experimental musics, Minimal Art. His work is presented internationally in radio broadcasts and at festivals of new music including the Bludenzer Tage zeitgemäßer Musik, Donaueschinger Musiktage,Donaueschingen Archive at SWR Radio MaerzMusik,MaerzMusik Artist Archive Darmstadt and Carnegie Hall.Berlin In Lights Festival Program, Carnegie Hall His works do not fall into a single personal style, but they generally share a crystalline clarity of texture and a seek to focus listeners' perception of sounding structures into a process of musical 'thinking'. Sabat is a frequent collaborator, having worked often with visual artists and other composers, including brother painter and filmmaker Peter Sabat. Other collaborators include John Oswald (composer), Martin Arnold, Nicolas Fernandez, Matteo Fargion, Wolfgang von Schweinitz, and Stefan Bartling. Most recently, since 2006 he has been working on a series of works placing compositions in scenery with works of Düsseldorf-based artist Lorenzo Pompa. Sabat's music may be heard on the Plainsound Music Edition YouTube Channel.Plainsound on YouTube Research Since the early 1990s, Sabat has been reinvestigating harmony by studying the theory and musical applications of Just Intonation. Together with Wolfgang von Schweinitz he conceived and developed a method of staff notation for JI ratios called The Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation.The Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation He has also studied JI intervals empirically on string and brass instruments, developing a list of so-called \\"tuneable intervals\\": ratios within a three-octave span which can readily be tuned by ear using electronic or acoustic sounds. These intervals have been used in a number of recent compositions and also are the basis of a self-tuning computer algorithm (\\"Micromaelodeon\\")An Algorithm for Real-Time Harmonic Microtuning which is currently under development. The most recent version was implemented in April 2009 on a Haken Audio Continuum Fingerboard and programmed in MaxMSP. Current and Upcoming Projects Recent projects include a concerto for piano and 14 instruments, \\"Lying in the grass, river and clouds\\", premiered by Daan Vandewalle in Bludenz with Ensemble Contrechamps commissioned by Alexander Moosbrugger with funding from the Ernst von Siemens Musikstiftung and the Canada Council, premiered at the 2012 Bludenzer Tage zeitgemäßer Musik, a songcycle and cantata on texts by Uljana Wolf, a trio for Magnus Andersson, Rohan de Saram and Pascal Gallois, a bass solo for Frank Reinecke. Studies, Teaching, Residencies Sabat studied at the University of Toronto, at the Juilliard School in New York, as well as working privately with Malcolm Goldstein, James Tenney and Walter Zimmermann. He attended courses in electronic and computer music at McGill University. In 2008-9 he took part in a postgraduate pilot project initiated by the Berlin University of the Arts, the Graduiertenschule für die Künste und die Wissenschaften. He teaches courses in composition, acoustics and experimental intonationUdK Composition Faculty Listings at the Universität der Künste Berlin, and has been a guest artist at the California Institute of the Arts, at the Escola Superior in Barcelona, the Janáček Music Academy in Brno and the Paris Conservatoire. In fall 2010, he was artist-in-residence of the Villa Aurora in Los Angeles,Villa Aurora Grant Recipients followed in 2011 by a one-year Stipendium at the German Academy in Rome, Villa Massimo.Villa Massimo Stipendiaten 2011 Previous residencies include Akademie Schloss Solitude (1997–98, music juror: Christian Wolff), Herrenhaus Edenkoben (1996, music juror: Peter Eötvös). Career as Violinist Beginning in the 1980s, Sabat has also been active as a performer on violin and adapted viola, concentrating primarily on American Experimental Music of the 20th Century. He has recorded CDs of music by James Tenney, Morton Feldman, Christian Wolff, and Maria de Alvear, amongst others. In the 1990s, whilst living in Toronto, he formed a duo with pianist Stephen Clarke, as well as performing with the Modern Quartet and Arraymusic. Like the great American pianist and electronic musician David Tudor, in recent years Sabat has largely abandoned a concert career in favor of creating his own music.

c. 1256 – after 1314) was the second daughter of Stephen V of Hungary and his wife Queen Elizabeth, daughter of Seyhan, chieftain of the Cumans. Catherine became Queen consort of Serbia by her marriage to Stephen Dragutin of Serbia. Family Catherine was the second of six children. Her sister Elizabeth also became a Queen of Serbia, by her marriage to Stephen Dragutin's brother, Stefan Uroš II Milutin of Serbia. Another sister, Maria married Charles II of Naples and had fourteen children. Catherine's third sister, Anna married Andronikos II Palaiologos. Catherine's brother was Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Catherine's paternal grandparents were Béla IV of Hungary and his wife Maria Laskarina. Her maternal grandparents were Seyhan, leader of a tribe of Cumans, his wife was Mstislawna, a Russian noblewomen who may have royal connections. Marriage The efforts of Catherine's grandfather, Bela IV of Hungary to secure his southern boundary while moving toward the Adriatic included establishing leaders in Srem (John Angelos) and Slavonia (Rostislav Mikhailovich) who were not only capable but also closely connected to the royal family. It is quite reasonable that an effective way to at least neutralize Serbia under Uros would be to connect him through dynastic marriage to Hungarian nobility, whether by diplomacy or force. Such use of dynastic marriage occurred, for example, in 1268 when Stephen Uroš I of Serbia unsuccessfully attempted to conquer Macva (Macsó). The result was the marriage of Catherine to his son Stephen Dragutin of Serbia in c.1268. A detailed reexamination of the relations between Hungary and Serbia in the period 1240-1265, and especially around 1250, would be expected to show that the marriage of Helen of Anjou and Stephen Uros was a natural outcome of political factors. Such a study would also aid in illuminating later developments in Hungarian-Serbian relations. For example, it is well known that Dragutin was given Macva, Usor and Soli by his brother-in-law Ladislas IV of Hungary after yielding the Serbian throne to his brother Milutin in 1282. It has been assumed that he was known as King of Srem because these territories south of the Sava included those which at one time were called Sirmia ulterior by the Hungarians, even though only Sirmia citerior between the Sava and Danube was normally known as Srem. Dragutin received many of these lands due to his marriage to Catherine.On Hungarian-Serbian Relations in the 13th Century:John Angelos and Queen Jelena Catherine and Stephen Dragutin had three children: *Stefan Vladislav II, king of Srem (1316–1325). *Elisabeth, married in 1284 to Stephen I, Ban of Bosnia, becoming mother of Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia. *Urošic, monk. Catherine's children were heirs to the throne of Hungary when Catherine's brother Ladislaus died childless, after neglecting his wife, Elizabeth of Sicily, for the sake of their Cuman family. However, Catherine's children did not inherit Hungary, her distant cousin, Andrew III of Hungary inherited instead, though his claim was in question because other European monarchs believed that Hungary was in their possession. However, Catherine's son Stefan Vladislav II of Syrmia was always a pretender to Hungary even after the death of Andrew III in 1301. Catherine and her son were in competition with her nephews. Catherine's nephew, Charles Martel of Anjou gave them the province of Slavonia even though it did not belong to him. A Byzantine envoy who visited the Serbian court about 1268 to participate in ultimately failed negotiations for a marriage alliance wrote of the conditions at court disparagingly: The Great King [Uroš] as he is called, lives a simple life in such a way that would be a disgrace for a middling official in Constantinople; the king's Hungarian daughter-in-law [Katalin] works at her spinning wheel in a cheap dress; the household eats like a pack of hunters or sheep-stealers.

Aldershot: Gale & Polden Ltd.North, REFG. (1934). The Punjab Frontier Force: A Brief Record of Their Services 1846–1924. DI Khan: Commercial Steam Press. Early history The regiment was raised on 18 May 1849 by Captain JE Gastrell at Leiah as part of the Transfrontier Brigade. In 1851, the brigade was expanded and redesignated as the Punjab Irregular Force, which later became famous as the Punjab Frontier Force or The Piffers. The Piffers consisted of five regiments of cavalry, eleven regiments of infantry and five batteries of artillery besides the Corps of Guides. Their mission was to maintain order on the Punjab Frontier; a task they performed with great aplomb. The 5th Punjab Infantry took part in numerous frontier operations besides the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857–58, when it operated in Oudh and Nepal. During the Second Afghan War of 1878–80, the regiment fought in the Battle of Peiwar Kotal and took part in the defence of Sherpur Cantonment at Kabul. In 1897, it took part in the Tirah Campaign. 58th Vaughan's Rifles (Frontier Force) Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 58th Vaughan's Rifles (Frontier Force). In 1914, the regiment's class composition was three companies each of Pathans and Sikhs, and one company each of Dogras and Punjabi Muslims. During the First World War, the regiment served on the Western Front in 1914–15, fighting in the Battles of Givenchy-les-la-Bassee, Neuve Chapelle, Aubers Ridge and Loos. In 1915, it served in Egypt moving to Palestine in 1917, where it fought in the Third Battle of Gaza, the Battle of Nebi Samwil and the Capture of Jerusalem. In 1918, it fought in the Battle of Megiddo, which led to the annihilation of Turkish Army in Palestine. Subsequent History After the First World War, the 58th Vaughan's Rifles (Frontier Force) was grouped with the 55th, 57th, 59th, and the two battalions of 56th Punjabi Rifles (Frontier Force) to form the 13th Frontier Force Rifles in 1922. The 58th Vaughan's Rifles became 5th Battalion of the new regiment. During the Second World War, the battalion served in Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, North Africa and Italy. In 1947, the Frontier Force Rifles was allotted to Pakistan Army. In 1948, 5 FF Rifles fought in the Kashmir War against India. In 1956, the Frontier Force Rifles and the Pathan Regiment were merged with the Frontier Force Regiment, and 5 FF Rifles was redesignated as 10 FF. During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, the battalion fought in the Battle of Khem Karan in the Kasur Sector.Attiqur Rahman, Lt Gen M. (1980).

Early life and family Cook was born in Felsted, Essex in 1922. He was the eldest of the six children of Reginald Thomas Cook, a customs and excise officer, and his wife, Ethel, Saxon, who was active in the Congregational church. His family were active churchgoers and Cook retained a lifelong Christian commitment. He was educated first at the village school at Felsted, then at West Leigh School and finally (from 1933) at Westcliff High School for Boys. In 1939 he won a major entrance scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.Malcolm S. Longair, Cook, Sir Alan Hugh (1922–2004)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2008; online edn, Oct 2008 accessed 25 Nov 2010 On 30 January 1948 he married Isabell Weir Adamson. The couple had a son and a daughter. He died from cancer on 23 July 2004 at Arthur Rank House, Cambridge. Academic and scientific career Cook entered Corpus Christi College in 1940, reading 'the natural science tripos' (physical sciences, biological sciences and the history and philosophy of science) and geology, receiving a BA in 1943. On graduation, he was drafted into the Admiralty Signals Establishment (now part of the Admiralty Research Establishment) as a temporary experimental officer, in the field of electronic counter-measures. After the war he returned to Cambridge, where he studied for his doctorate under Edward Bullard and B. C. Browne. His dissertation was on precise measurements of gravity in the British Isles. This developed into his core research interest: precision measurement in a wide range of areas the physical sciences. Thereafter, he did post- doctoral work there in geodesy and geophysics.Sir Alan Cook, obituary, The Times, 6 August 2004 Cook followed Bullard to the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington, working at the meteorological department, where he carried out a number of experiments, including the absolute measurement of the density of mercury, important for precise estimates of atmospheric pressure; measuring the absolute acceleration of falling bodies, and determining the Earth's gravitational potential, by using the precisely known orbits of the Sputnik satellites. His interests included precision measurement for time and length standards, particularly using hyperfine lines in the spectrum of cadmium and interference spectroscopy, laser interferometry and masers. In 1966 he became superintendent of the Laboratory's quantum metrology division. In 1969 he became professor of geophysics at Edinburgh University, founding that university's geophysics department. Three years later, he was appointed Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, where he set up the laboratory astrophysics group. His work there included experiments in microwave spectroscopy and tests of the inverse square law of gravitation at short distances. In 1979 he became head of the Laboratory, and from 1983 to 1993 was master of Selwyn College. His PhD students included the future astronaut Michael Foale. After retiring he took a strong interest in the history of science, and was the editor, from 1996, of Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, that Society's main journal on the history of science.

During the 1950s, she was a popular commercial model and pin-up girl. After marrying entrepreneur Joe Weider in 1961, she began a lengthy career as a spokesperson and trainer in the health and bodybuilding movements. She has been a longtime magazine columnist and co-authored several books on fitness and physical exercise. Early life Betty Choloe Brosemer was born in Pasadena, California, on August 6, 1929, to Andrew Brosemer and Vendla Alvaria Pippenger. Her first name has sometimes been reported as Elizabeth, but she has stated that this is incorrect.Sullivan, p. 215. She lived her early childhood in Carmel but later, from about the age of ten, grew up in Los Angeles. Naturally small and slight of frame, Brosmer embarked on a personal bodybuilding and weight training regimen before she was a teenager. Raised as a sports fan by her father, she excelled in youth athletics and was \\"something of a tomboy\\". A photo of Brosmer appeared in the Sears & Roebuck catalog when she was 13 years old. The following year she visited New York City with her aunt and posed for pictures with a professional photographic studio; one of her photos was sold to Emerson Televisions for use in commercial advertising, and it became a widely used promotional piece, printed in national magazines for several years thereafter. Modeling career Brosmer returned to Los Angeles and was soon asked to pose for two of the most celebrated pin-up artists of the era, Alberto Vargas and Earl Moran. Encouraged, her aunt took her back to New York City again in 1950, and this time they took up residency. Brosmer built her photographic portfolio while attending George Washington High School in Manhattan. Despite her age, over the next four years Brosmer found frequent work as a commercial model, and graced the covers of many of the ubiquitous postwar \\"pulps\\": popular romance and crime magazines and books. As she explained, \\"When I was 15, I was made up to look like I was about 25\\".Sullivan, p. 216. Some of her most famous photo work during this period include glamour appearances in Picture Show (December 1950, cover); People Today (July 1954, centerspread); Photo (January 1955); and Modern Man (February 1955; May 1955).Sullivan, p. 218. She was also employed as a fashion model, and in 1954 posed for Christian Dior. She won numerous New York area beauty contests in the early 1950s, most famously \\"Miss Television\\"; in that capacity she appeared in TV Guide, as well as on the widely seen programs of Steve Allen, Milton Berle, Jackie Gleason and others. Her fame had grown so much by the age of eighteen that when she left New York and returned to California – this time to Hollywood – her departure was noted in the celebrity column of Walter Winchell. Back on the West Coast, Brosmer maintained a busy freelance workload in fashion and commercial modeling, while at the same time continuing her education, majoring in psychology at UCLA. She also entered into a lucrative contract with the glamour photographer Keith Bernard, and she worked steadily with him for the rest of the decade. For Bernard, a well- established photographer who had worked with Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield, Brosmer would prove to be the top-selling pin-up model of his career.Graysmith, pp. 159–160. Brosmer's publication work during the late 1950s includes appearances in Modern Man (October 1956, cover); Photoplay (April 1958, cover); and Rogue (July 1958 and February 1959, covers).Sullivan, pp. 221–222. During this time, Brosmer was said to be the highest paid pin-up model in the United StatesWeider & Weider (2006), p. 120. – she was seen in \\"virtually every men's magazine of the era\\".Sullivan, p. 221. Playboy magazine pursued Brosmer for an exclusive pictorial, and a photo shoot was set up in Beverly Hills. The resulting picture set was rejected, however, after Brosmer declined to do any nude posing: \\"I wore sort of a half-bra or low demi-bra with nothing showing ... and that's what I thought they wanted.\\"Sullivan, p. 220. Playboy threatened a lawsuit over the alleged breach of contract, but ultimately relinquished the case. The photos were eventually sold to Escapade magazine and published in its anthology issue Escapade's Choicest #3 (1959).Sullivan, p. 222. Brosmer never did any nude or semi-nude modeling throughout her long career: as she explained later in life, \\"I didn't think it was immoral, but I just didn't want to cause problems for others ... I thought it would embarrass my future husband and my family\\". That future husband would turn out to be bodybuilding enthusiast and magazine publisher Joe Weider, who had first become aware of Brosmer through his contact with Keith Bernard for fitness models. Brosmer's first photos for a Weider magazine appeared as a four-page layout in Figure & Beauty in December 1956. After that, Weider regularly sought out her work among Bernard's submissions. She was known to be his favorite model and he requested her more and more frequently after their first face-to-face meeting in 1959.Sullivan, p. 223. The two grew close due to their mutual professional and personal interests in fitness and psychology, and they were married on April 24, 1961. The marriage was Joe Weider's second, and he had one daughter from his previous wife; he and Brosmer had no children together. Their marriage would last over fifty years, until Joe Weider's death in 2013 at the age of 93. Fitness career After marriage, Brosmer ceased posing as a pin-up, but she continued to be frequently photographed. For many years she was seen routinely in Weider publications helping to advertise a wide range of fitness products.Sullivan, p. 224. She remained a highly visible presence among the various magazines, and was continuously included in their editorial photo work as well. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, she appeared in many pictorial layouts, and also often on the covers of Weider titles like Jem, Vigor, and Muscle Builder. Her later cover appearances were sometimes paired with other prominent bodybuilders of the day like Frank Zane, Mike Mentzer, and Robby Robinson; her final cover shot was on Muscle and Fitness in May 1988, with Larry Scott.Sullivan, p. 225. Under her marital name Betty Weider, she served as a regular contributing writer for Muscle and Fitness for over three decades. As her writing style developed, she focused on her own monthly M&F; columns, \\"Body by Betty\\" and \\"Health by Betty\\". She also worked as associate editor for the female-oriented Weider magazine, Shape. With her husband, she authored two book-length fitness guides, The Weider Book of Bodybuilding for Women (1981) and The Weider Body Book (1984). With Joyce Vedral, she designed an all-ages workout regimen for women, published in 1993 as Better and Better. In 2004, the Weiders donated $1 million to the University of Texas at Austin to support the physical culture collection of the H.J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports. The gift was key to the Stark Center's establishment of a permanent exhibition space, now known as the Joe and Betty Weider Museum of Physical Culture. The museum holds hundreds of items in its 10,000 square foot gallery space, and was opened to the public in August 2011. In popular culture In The Dirty Dozen (1967), pin-ups of Brosmer can be seen on the walls of the MP barracks. Posters of her are also seen hanging on gym walls in the documentary Pumping Iron (1977), and she makes a walk-on appearance as an audience member at a bodybuilding competition in Pumping Iron II: The Women (1985). She is portrayed by actress Julianne Hough in the Weider family biopic Bigger (2018).

Knut Detlef Folkerts (born 1 January 1952 in Singen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) is a former member of the terrorist group, the Red Army Faction (RAF). In 1977 he was sentenced to 20 years in prison in the Netherlands for murder. Later he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in West Germany for crimes including the murder of public prosecutor Siegfried Buback: however he was then released from prison in 1995 when doubts were raised about the reliability of the original conviction in Germany.  Time with the RAF and arrest  Memorial plate for policeman Arie Kranenburg in Utrecht Folkerts was sentenced in a Frankfurt court together with Willy-Peter Stoll for the robbery of a firearms business on 1 July 1977. In an interview in 2007 he denied any involvement.Spiegel Online: „Ex-Terroristen entlasten Klar und Folkerts als Buback-Mörder“ (21. April 2007) On 22 September 1977 Folkerts and Elisabeth von Dyck set out to return a car to a Dutch car rental business. The car had been rented by Sigrid Sternebeck and used in connection with the kidnapping and murder of Hanns Martin Schleyer. The surroundings were under surveillance and the police tried to arrest Folkerts. Folkerts fatally shot Dutch policeman Arie Kranenburg (born 10 June 1931) and seriously wounded a second officer. Folkerts was arrested, Elisabeth von Dyck, originally mistaken for Brigitte Mohnhaupt, managed to escape. The German authorities offered Folkerts a new identity in the USA and one million Deutschmarks if he agreed to betray the hiding place of Hanns Martin Schleyer. Folkerts claimed later that the BKA at the same time threatened him with hanging if he rejected the offer. Trials and imprisonment Knut Folkerts was sentenced in Utrecht to 20 years in prison for the murder of Arie Kranenburg. After one year in Dutch custody however he was transferred to Germany where he faced further serious charges. On 31 July 1980 he was sentenced in Stuttgart to two life terms in prison for the murder of public prosecutor Siegfried Buback and his two bodyguards, for forming a terrorist organisation and for the robbery at the firearms business in Frankfurt am Main.Interview mit Knut Folkerts in: Der Spiegel 20/2007, Seite 60. On 16 October 1995 he was released early. Former RAF-members had stated that Folkerts had been in Amsterdam at the time of the murder, and so was not involved directly in the action. In May 2007 Folkerts said in an interview with Spiegel magazine, that he knew about the Red Army Faction plan to kill Siegfried Buback, but he was not directly involved. The lawyer Michael RosenthaI, interviewed by the news magazine Der Spiegel in 2007, reiterated doubts about the reliability of witnesses who had testified to having seen Folkerts at the scene of the crime.Rechtsanwalt in Spiegel Diskussion:…„denkbar, dass damals alle Zeugen geirrt haben“ (20. August 2007) Legal controversy On 5 August 2005, the Dutch authorities demanded, not least because of pressure from the murdered policeman's widow, Joke Kranenburg, that Folkert should serve the rest of his sentence for the Utrecht murder. They submitted a Judicial Assistance application to the German legal authorities. The Dutch move was designed to circumvent a recent (July 2005) judgement by the German Constitutional Court which had blocked the extradition of German citizens. On 31 May 2006, a court in The Hague ruled that Folkerts must serve a sentence of 20 years in the Netherlands. However, on 16 June 2011 the Hamburg Regional High Court determined that the Dutch application was inadmissible for reasons of proportionality. The Hamburg court determined that Folkert had renounced terrorism and behaved well since his release in 1995, and they also noted that he had expressed his regrets to the widow of the policeman whom he had killed. On 28 December 2007 the investigating judges of the German Federal Court of Justice made a Coercive Detention Order of up to six months against the former RAF members Knut Folkerts, Christian Klar and Brigitte Mohnhaupt. This was intended to force the detainees to make a statement on the 1977 murder of Siegfried Buback. Folkerts' lawyer stated that he would not testify.Anwälte erwarten keine Aussagen bei Beugehaft auf welt.de (5.

Probably the mistake is caused by the fact that Jacques sounds more French, but the French scientist referred to in this article was called Jack Arthur Masquelier. Jack Masquelier was a French scientist. In July 1948 he published his doctoral thesis based on his successful isolation and chemical description of the phytonutrient we know today as oligomeric proanthocyanidins or OPCs. That same year he filed a patent for the industrial method of producing the first botanical product based on OPCs. Based on Masquelier's role in the research and development of OPCs-products, their isolation, identification and therapeutic and dietary applications, two other botanical products followed. In the 1960s, a botanical medicine based on OPCs isolated from Pinus maritima bark was produced, followed ten years later by another OPCs-based medicinal product manufactured from Vitis vinifera seeds. These medicinal products are still sold in France today. During the 1980s these complex but well characterized phytonutrients were introduced on the natural products market and are now sold around the world as dietary supplements. The postwar period, when Masquelier began his research, was marked by a surge in interest in flavanols, the group of bioactives to which proanthocyandins belong. In 1951, Australian scientist W.G.C. Forsyth first isolated flavonols from fresh coco- beans. In that same year, using Masquelier's OPCs, the English phytochemist E.C. Bate-Smith, working at Cambridge (UK), developed and first described a coloration method to detect the presence of proanthocyanidins in plant materials. Masquelier's scientific work was important in the early development of two areas of science: phytochemistry and human health. Finding that the nomenclature used in the fields of phytochemistry and botany could easily lead to confusion and imprecision when applied in the field of dietary and pharmaceutical products, Masquelier, together with his lifetime friend and colleague Dr. Jean Michaud, focused on, and succeeded in the characterisation of OPCs-based products in conformity with nutritional and pharmaceutical standards, thus fitting for the field of human health. Through his scientific investigation Masquelier revealed the many health benefits of OPCs. The key early finding of Masquelier was that OPCs strengthen and protect blood vessels and vascular function, so essential for the function of every organ in the body. This set in motion a series of independent clinical studies by several other scientists that sustained his findings and provided conclusive support for the use of Masquelier's OPCs-compounds in the French vasculo-protective medicines. In 1985, Masquelier was able to further explain the intense and instant positive effects that OPCs have on the human body when he discovered that OPCs neutralize free radicals, the common cause of seemingly unrelated degenerative conditions and early onset of age-associated changes in the body. He found that OPCs are powerful antioxidants and are unique in their ability to work in both aqueous and lipid phase to provide superior antioxidant support. Masquelier's discoveries have influenced human health worldwide, and have gained significance in this era when life expectancy has increased while accompanied by an equally dramatic increase in cardiovascular and other degenerative diseases.

It remains a key textbook in the modern Hawza and has been the subject of numerous commentaries. Makasib and the notable work of Akhund Khorasani, Kefayah al- osul, are taught in advanced classes at the seminaries. This book is one of the resources for the examination of the Assembly of Experts. Author Sheikh Morteza Ansari (1781, Dezful – 1864, Najaf) was one of the most influential Shia scholars of the 19th century. He trained more than a thousand students. He was the leading Shia scholar in the late Qajar period. After Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi, Ansari became the general Marja' of Shia. Two of his most significant works are Makasib and Faraed al-Osul, which are both used as textbooks on Shia law. Concept of the book This book has three sections. The first section is about forbidden transactions (), the second is about sale (), and the third is about options in the sale (). The end of the book is devoted to other issues, such as Taqiya, inheritance, and rada. Commentaries Makasib has been the subject of commentaries by Sheikh Abbas Qomi, Akhund Khorasani, Muhammad Hossein Naini, Agha Zia Addin Araghi, Mirza Abu'l-Hassan Azarbaijani Meshkini, and Sheikh Mousavi Khansari.

In the succeeding section a strongly marked rallentando was achieved, which made for a pleasing contrast when the livelier tempo was resumed.\\" Harper was conductor from 1920 to 1964. Performances by the band, in October 1939, were broadcast on national radio stations, 4QN (Townsville), 7NT (Launceston), and 2FC (Sydney). They performed the national anthem for the Australian Governor-General, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in August 1945 during his visit to Ipswich. Later they \\"played a specially selected programme. Items were: Marches, 'Invicta' and 'Contemptibles'; song marches, 'Waltzing Matilda', 'There'll Always Be an England', 'We Did It Before so We'll Do It Again' and 'Advance Australia Fair'; song, 'Cherie'.\\" In October 1954 the band moved into their new headquarters, a hall, in East Ipswich. Note: includes photo of the hall and another of the band performing. They established a public appeal to fund the purchase. In 1967 it was named, Harper Hall, in honour of their long-term former conductor. As from February 2017 the band still performs, rehearses and meets in the hall. Their repertoire consists of, \\"Australiana, film and television scores and themes from animated productions.\\"  References  External links * www.ipswichmodelband.org.au Category:Ipswich, Queensland Category:1906 establishments in Australia ","title":"Ipswich Model Band"},{"id":"24478483","text":"István Bujtor (5 May 1942 – 25 September 2009), born István Frenreisz, was a Hungarian actor, director, producer and screenplay writer.

The ride was constructed by Intamin and opened on 20 March 2010. It is the world's first vertical freefall drop roller coaster, on which the track and train freefall approximately five metres in darkness. The ride replaced and is built on the former site of the Corkscrew, which resided at Alton Towers for 28 years between 1980 and 2008. Development history Thirteen under construction in October 2009 Alton Towers first revealed their plans for the ride in October 2008 when it was announced that Corkscrew would be removed. Planning permission was initially delayed due to concerns about an Iron Age hill fort in its vicinity. However, in March 2009, Staffordshire Moorlands District Council accepted planning permission for the ride (with conditions) and groundwork construction commenced about three months later. During the planning stages and construction, the ride was codenamed Secret Weapon 6. John Wardley, a ride consultant for Merlin Entertainments, spoke about the development of Thirteen in an interview shortly after the ride's opening. The initial idea for the secret element originated from a previous rollercoaster plan that he designed for Alton Towers, in which a piece of track tilted back and forth during the ride. The ride, if it had been built, would have been similar to Winjas Fear and Force at Phantasialand, Germany. The ageing Corkscrew roller coaster was removed ahead of the new ride's development. The coaster model was decided as an Intamin family coaster, chosen for the lightweight trains to perform the vertical drop element. The concept and theme was designed by Merlin Magic Making (MMM). The Alton Towers marketing team made an effort to keep the \\"world's first\\" element secret so that the surprise feature would not be revealed until the ride was opened. In 2008, concept art showing possible themes for the new ride were leaked online but only appeared briefly after they were deleted at Alton Towers' command. In a press statement that was released several months after construction started, the ride was promoted as a 'psychoaster' and was said to create a level of psychological fear. Marketing Some of Thirteen's theming Various phrases and slogans were used to promote the ride. In August, a banner was erected next to the construction site on 8 October reading: \\"Ride into the Unknown\\". Alton Towers released a new marketing campaign later inviting readers to \\"Ride the Demon of the Dark Forest\\" and \\"Surrender in March 2010\\". However, neither of these campaigns expressly revealed the name of the new ride. The attraction's name was officially announced as Thirteen on 11 December 2009 through a press release. The ride's main slogan was used after: \\"If you go down to the woods today, you'd better not go alone.\\" During the park's 2009 Scarefest, hooded wraiths were seen roaming around the Ug Land area in the build-up to the new ride. Warning signs were put up explaining their appearance was linked to \\"next year's new ride\\". The resort has also used viral marketing through social-networking websites to promote the ride. Alton Towers released many online and television teaser videos in the run up to the opening of the ride. These included a video of a truck supposedly delivering the \\"secret weapon\\", and three promotional blipverts which featured a possessed girl walking in a forest. The full adverts were released before opening day, with a pre-watershed and post-watershed version. The advertisement to be shown after 9 pm included the same girl seen in previous videos being entangled by moving branches as she whispered: \\"If you go down to the woods today, you'd better not go alone... 13\\". The advert also uses a short but 'darker' version of the Alton Towers theme music (Edvard Grieg's In the Hall of the Mountain King).  Publicity  An early press release initially stated that thirteen - deemed to be the scariest rollercoaster ever created (with a world's first element) would require a signed waiver of liability just to ride. They also said there would be an age restriction of 16–55 years old allowed on. This however was only a marketing ploy and there were no age limits or other restrictions put in place, aside from the height restrictions: riders must be over 1.2 metres and under 1.96 metres to ride. On 22 July 2010, Alton Towers announced on their Facebook page that Thirteen would be closed on Friday 13 August 2010, because of superstitious reasons. Morwenna Angove, Head of Marketing at the Resort, stated: \\"Our research has revealed that Britons are a seriously superstitious bunch, and as our latest ride is named after the unluckiest of numbers, we've taken the decision to close that ride on Friday 13 to reassure our visitors.\\" It was later revealed that the ride was to be renamed 'Fourteen' (stylized as FOU13TEEN) throughout Friday 13 August 2010 instead of closing. New limited merchandise was available during the day featuring the 'Fourteen' name. Most signage to the ride was temporarily changed to feature the new name. In 2010's Scarefest event, in addition to the wraiths, the girl from the adverts promoting the ride would also appear. In 2011's Scarefest event, a fictional warning was played at the station of Thirteen which told that they had caused disappearances and deaths and told that if \\"you don't touch them, they will not touch you\\". Ride experience One of the ride's trains exiting the station The ride starts with a sharp, unbanked turn out of the station into a lift hill up to the main drop, which sends the train speeding into woodland at up to 41 mph. Thirteen's track layout performs many airtime hills (limited by the many trim brakes on the layout) and banked turns, before entering a second lift hill which leads into a dark crypt where the surprise element takes place. Sections of the outdoor track have been fitted with speed-reducing devices due to early problems with the ride entering its second lift hill too quickly. The entry door is closed behind the train as it comes to a halt and the sound of creaking wood is heard. Suddenly, the lights go out and the train jolts, before the track and train freefall drop around 5 metres. A wraith figure is illuminated in front of the train and compressed air blasts towards riders. The carriage is propelled backwards out of the crypt, down a drop and into a disorienting backwards helix. The train emerges from the darkness and stops behind a transfer track, which switches the path of the train back towards the station before the train is propelled forwards and arrives at the offload platform. 'World's First' element Since the project was announced in late 2008, the ride was confirmed to join the growing line of world first rides at Alton Towers. It was confirmed that the well-kept 'secret weapon' element would take place in the showroom section, a building next to the station. It was revealed on 17 March 2010, that the ride is the \\"world's first free-fall drop roller coaster\\". This was shown on GMTV, on a special feature about Thirteen and also had an on-ride video of some of the first riders. A view of the ride was also shown on Central Tonight, and shows the freefall section in brighter lighting than GMTV had shown earlier on in the day. This surprise sequence consists of a horizontal section of track, on which the train stops, which freefalls downwards, making Thirteen the world's first vertical free-fall roller coaster.

The school provides an education for children from Maternelle – Year 12 and is linked to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is approved by the AEFE (Agency for French Teaching Abroad), and regulated by French authorities. The IB Diploma Programme is approved by the International Baccalaureate Organization. The school is a member of the Association of Independent Schools. The petite and moyenne section of maternelle are approved by the NSW Department of Education. History The school was established in 1969, and was renamed to 'Lycée Condorcet' in 1988 on the eve of the bicentenary of the French Revolution of 1789. This name was based on Marie Jean Antoine Caritat, the marquis of Condorcet, the famous father of French Education. In 2003, the school moved to its current location in Maroubra, on the site of the former Maroubra High School. Education The curriculum taught at the Lycée Condorcet follows the French education system, with the exception of the English classes which follow the NSW curriculum. Staff at the school are mostly French trained teachers. The International French school accepts enrolments from all students with a working knowledge of French in primary school and secondary school and students who only speak English are welcome to join the school from year 10 onwards as part of the International Baccalaureate program. Students from grade 10 to 12 are classed in the upper secondary school, considered the 'international section' by the school. Students in these years are prepared for their upcoming International Baccalaureate exams or they prepare the French Baccalaureate. Those students taking the International Baccalaureate (IB) are taught by teachers entirely in English for the rest of these years whereas those taking the French Baccalaureate study entirely in French. Despite being in New South Wales, the school does not formally conform to the Department of Education's curriculum, but is registered by the NSW government as a specialist school from preschool level to year 12. Unlike non-government or government schools in the state, the students are not required to wear uniform whilst attending classes, as is the custom in France. The school year follows roughly the European calendar. It begins in August and ends in June, unlike the Australian education system which starts the year in January and ends it in December. Students The student population at the school is made up of over 20 nationalities and the school has initiated effort to make sure non-Francophone students learn French via foreign language classes.

He has been open about both his own homosexuality and depicting gay themes in his films, despite the subject being particularly taboo in Southeast Asian society. His first film, Solos, was withdrawn from its début screening at the 20th Singapore International Film Festival due to its explicit depiction of homosexual sex. Instead it premièred at the 12th Busan International Film Festival in the city of Pusan in South Korea and became the first Singaporean film to be selected for the American Film Institute Festival in Los Angeles, going on to win the Nuovo Sguardi Award in the 23rd Turin Gay and Lesbian Festival, in the city of Turin in Italy. It was awarded by the jury to the film which \\"reflects the evolution of queer cinema\\". Loo appeared in Pleasure Factory (Kuaile Gongchang), a film directed by Thai director Ekachai Uekrongtham about the red-light district in Geylang, Singapore. The film premiered in the Un Certain Regard section of the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. In February 2012, as part of the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival, Loo staged a one-night only performance of Cane, which re-enacted a performance art piece by Singaporean artist Josef Ng that resulted in a 10-year no-funding rule for performance art. In December 2012, Loo organised his first solo exhibition Archiving Cane at The Substation, which consisted of an installation of 12 artefacts to do with Cane and Loo's artistic practice, along with a durational performance. From October to December 2013, Loo put on Artists' General Assembly – The Langenbach Archive, a durational performance-cum-installation as part of Ghost: The Body at the Turn of the Century group exhibition, a parallel event of the Singapore Biennale. The installation archived a selection of approximately 150 of Dr. Ray Langenbach's materials surrounding the Artists' General Assembly and its peripheral events.

Loo told The Straits Times: \\"As a queer person, I have always been inspired by Paddy's strength and fortitude. I often wonder, if I was put in his position, whether I would have the courage to step out like he did.\\" With/Out featured the first public screening of taped performances from three evenings of Completely With/Out Character, which Chew performed a few months before his death. With/Out was restaged in 2017, commissioned as part of The Studios season featuring the works by Singaporean playwright Haresh Sharma at Esplanade, Theatres on the Bay. The restaging featured actor and ex-Member of Parliament Janice Koh performing the text from Completely With/Out Character in cadence with video documentation of the 1999 performance.

The word alcazaba, from the Arabic word (; al-qaṣabah), signifies a walled fortification in a city. History In 955, Almería gained the title of medina (\\"city\\") by the Caliph of Cordoba, Abd ar-Rahman III: construction of the defensive citadel, located in the upper sector of the city, began in this period. The alcazaba, provided not only with walls and towers but also with squares, houses and a mosque, was to be also the seat of the local government, commanding the city and the sea nearby. The complex was enlarged under caliph Al-Mansur and, later, under Al-Jairan, first king of the independent taifa of Almería (1012–1028). Its intention was to protect the hugest city of that moment, Pechina. The majority of the objects of an archaeological site found at the Alcazaba are kept in the Museo de Almería, although some pieces are kept in the Museo de la Alhambra. Description The first line of walls is a wide enclosure corresponding to the first Muslim military camp, used as shelter for the population in case of siege. For this task it was provided with large cisterns. The first enclosure is separated by the second one by the so-called Muro de la Vela (\\"Wall of the Sail\\"), taking its name from a bell that warned the population in case of events such as the arrival of a ship in the port, danger, fires etc. This wall was built by King Charles III of Spain. In the second enclosure was the residence for the governors, their soldiers and their servants. It included also the mosque, baths, tanks, tents etc. The third enclosure, the most external, is also the most modern in the complex. After the Christian conquest of Almería, the Catholic monarchs Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon had a castle built in the most elevated sector of the town, more apt to resist the new gunpowder artillery. Cinema The Alcazaba has been used to film Conan the Barbarian, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Never Say Never Again, and most recently Wonder Woman 1984, as well as the syndicated TV series Queen of Swords used the inner courtyard and gardens. Wonder Woman 1984 production company will donate 18.000 € to preserve and investigate the Alcazaba. The sixth season of the TV series Game of Thrones was shot in locations from Andalusia to Catalonia, including the Muralla de Jayrán, and the Alcazaba fortress, which is the capital of Dorne, the kingdom of the House Martell.

He served as Director of Overseas Intelligence for the Office of War Information in World War II and also wrote several works intersecting cognition, psychology and philosophy. Biography Born on March 3, 1909 in New York, Professor Doob received a B.A. from Dartmouth College in 1929 and an M.A. from Duke University the following year. From 1930 to 1933, he studied psychology and sociology at the University of Frankfurt in Germany, taught at Dartmouth and then received a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1934. His dissertation, started in Germany, was a study of news propaganda. He was an accomplished professor and scholar of Yale University from 1935 until resigning in 1999. In that time, he worked for the United States Office of War Information (OWI) during World War II, conducted several cross-cultural analyses and developed conflict resolution strategies in Africa and other conflict zones from the 1960s through the 80s, also publishing several compilations of African poetry during that time, and pioneered other works in psychology and philosophy up to the end of his long and prolific career. He was most active shortly before his death with his most recent book (Pursuing Perfection: People, Groups and Society) having been published in 1999. Leonard Doob died on March 29, 2000 in Hamden, Connecticut, predeceased by his wife, Eveline Bates Doob, and leaving his sons, Christopher, Anthony, and Nicholas, and grandchildren, Gabriella, Joshua and Crockett. Career A self-described liberal social psychologist, Professor Doob served as Executive Editor of The Journal of Social Psychology for over a third of a century, resigning shortly before his death in 2000. He joined the Yale faculty in 1934. In 1935 he published his first major, and most well-known work, Propaganda: Its Psychology and Techniques. A book widely used by students in American colleges and universities before World War II. The book represented an effort to illuminate the process by which propaganda changed attitudes, with a view toward helping to induce some resistance to the phenomenon, concluding with a survey of such leading propagandists as Ivy Lee, Edward Bernays, and the Communist Party, and explored newspaper, radio, movies, and other channels of communication.J. Michael Sproule (1997) Propaganda and Democracy: The American Experience of Media and Mass Persuasion, Cambridge University Press . As the storm of Nazi Germany was gathering, Doob was quick to realize, and well positioned to do something about, raising awareness among scholars, government officials, and the general public to increasing foreign propaganda. He conducted several communication studies, some of which analyzed rumors spreading within several communities in the US and Canada. Through World War II he served as researcher, policy chief and director of the Bureau of Overseas Intelligence within the United States Office of War Information (OWI). Here he was instrumental in developing, applying and improving social scientific methodology to the work of analyzing propaganda.L.

He also wrote articles on aggression and frustration, attitudes, communication, and persuasion, before moving into cross-cultural analyses of developing countries and investigating previously unexplored topics in psychology. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Sciences in 1966, also served as chair of Yale's Council on African Studies and as director of the Division of Social Studies before retiring in 1977. He continued to teach and publish before resigning shortly before his death in 2000. Psychology and propaganda Doob's approach believed understanding propaganda meant understanding communications and the behavioral sciences. Doob set out the mental context of propaganda by discussing motivation, attitudes, stereotypes, personality, and values. His psychological interpretation went to great lengths to describe the factors that influence and construct human behavior.Propaganda: It's Psychology and Technique (1935) He explained much of public opinion to stem from enduring collective attitudes and sentiments, learnt through socialization.Public Opinion and Propaganda (1940) While noting that propaganda was not automatically successful, he observed that people were susceptible to suggestion, especially from prestigious sources, and thus the symbols of propaganda might arouse and recombine pre-existing attitudes. Propaganda sometimes resulted from the explicit intentions of a persuader but also could be unintentional, as when educators indirectly transmitted the social heritage of a culture. Drawing on Freud, Lasswell, and others, Doob examined the psychology of suggestion created by stimuli and stimulus- situations. Added to the exploration of attitudes, beliefs, suggestions and associations, Doob, appreciating the power in the personalization of the process, also explored how stimulating aspects of individual identity, emotion, pride, guilt and shame can influence decision making, behavior, and attitudes.See also Robert K. Merton's Mass Persuasion: The Social Psychology of a War Bond Drive (1947) He defined propaganda in 1948 as \\"the attempt to affect the personalities and to control the behavior of individuals towards desired ends.\\"Origins of mass communications research during the American Cold War ... - Page 22 by Timothy Richard Glander - Language Arts & Disciplines - (2000) He saw the objective of propaganda as action, not merely readiness to respond. Action, and just sentiment and attitudes, are the target. The learned attitude - the pre-action response - most affects behavior. Propaganda is concerned with learned attitudes insofar as they predispose and influence a desired response. The suggestive power of words depend on the primary and secondary meanings and upon the pre-existing attitudes which they arouse. His study of newspapers shed light on this definition, demonstrating how headlines have a pronounced influence on the way stories are perceived by readers. If individuals are controlled through the use of suggestion, then regardless of intention or source, the process may be called propaganda. In an essay he wrote in 1989, Doob came to believe a clear-cut definition of propaganda was neither possible nor desirable because of the complexity of issues related to behavior in society and differences in times and cultures. The essential ingredients of successful propaganda, for Doob, contained three elements: repetition, cultural congruence, and flattery. Utilizing these three components, if the target is known and objectives clear, then the right acts combined with the right words, at the right time, can carry tremendous leverage. Ultimately, Leonard W. Doob was no advocate for propaganda, like his contemporary, Edward Bernays was. Instead, he viewed propaganda, like others such as Robert K. Merton and Jacques Ellul, through a critical lens, as a form of social control. He recognized its increasing role in modern forms of power and his analysis was intended to increase this awareness in order to minimize its manipulation of society, politics, and culture. In the process of research, however, Doob brought to light the organic relationship that exists between modes of communication systems and the development of cultures and their psychology. Like many, if not all, of his fellow theorists on the subject, he recognized propaganda as an integral component of modernization. Conflict resolution Doob also studied the psychological dimensions of nationalism, modernity, and the role of media and communication systems on different developed and developing societies. He sought to explain why people modernize and what happens to them when they do, developing several methodological indicators to do so. He worked on developing scales of assaying psychological modernization amongst tribal societies in Africa, concluding that acculturation tends to lead to increased aggression and discontent\\"Scales for Assaying Psychological Modernization in Africa\\", Public Opinion Quarterly, Vol. 31, Nov. 3, 1967 AND Becoming More Civilized (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1960) and producing one of the most comprehensive lists of African communicative forms that exists to this day. In the late 1960s and early 1970s several scholars of international relations developed conflict management training workshops, the purpose of which was to support a process towards peace in the context of intractable conflicts. Doob began experimenting with the application of human relations training methods to destructive conflicts in the Horn of Africa, Cyprus and Northern Ireland, helping to pioneer a third-party intermediary approach to conflict resolution. John Burton, Leonard Doob, and Herbert Kelman, among others, conducted \\"controlled communication\\" or problem solving workshops with high-level representatives of groups involved in protracted communal disputes in these societies.Resolving Conflict in Africa (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1970) Publications * Propaganda: Their Psychology and Techniques (1935) * Memorandum on Research in Competition and Co-operation.

In 1982 she became the last of ten former RAF members who escaped from West to East Germany and received support from state authorities including the Ministry for State Security. After reunification, convicted of attempted murder, she was sentenced to a thirteen-year jail term, but was released early in 1997, by which time she had, while still in prison, published her first book. Described sometimes in sources as a \\"retired terrorist\\", she differs from other leading participants in West Germany's extremist-terrorist wave of the 1970s in the extent to which she has been willing to talk about, and indeed to write about, those events from the activist perspective. Her participation in street demonstrations and apparent absence of contrition over her involvement with left-wing militancy continue to attract media interest and comment.  Life   Early years  Inge Viett was born in Stemwarde, a short distance to the east of Hamburg in the British occupation zone. The authorities removed her from her mother's care and she spent her early years, between 1946 and 1950, living in an orphanage in Schleswig-Holstein. In March 1950 she was placed with a foster family in a village of three hundred souls near Eckernförde. Viett would later describe the experience, especially with regard to her foster mother's attempts to bring her up, as \\"very burdensome\\" (\\"sehr belastend\\").\\"Nie war ich furchtloser\\" (\\"I was never free from fear\\"): Autobiography. Edition Nautilus, Hamburg 1997, . Rowohlt Taschenbuchverlag Reinbek 1999, ); pp. 18, 45, 53-61, 68, 80-86, 91-94, 107, 202, 256, 263, 307-326 Her comments on the wider community in the area would be more damning still. At one stage she was raped by a local farmer. She attended school in the village. When she was fifteen she ran away from the foster family. With the support of the local minister she obtained a place for a year in a Youth Facility at nearby Arnis where she was taught about house-keeping and child- care. The authorities then intervened to have her sent to train as a child- care assistant. Viett herself wanted to train to be a sports-teacher and found the training for work as a child-care assistant \\"ghastly\\" (\\"gräßlich\\"). The situation led her to a suicide attempt. The training nevertheless continued, and during her final \\"practical\\" year she was sent as a children's carer to a prosperous family in Hamburg. Here Inge Viett suffered on account of the authoritarian propensities of the father. She also had a good relationship at the time with a twenty year old supporter-trainer in Schleswig who took on responsibility for her progress and made it possible for her to attend the sports school. In addition, she became involved with an Afro-American soldier. In 1963 she embarked on a Sports and Gymnastics course at Kiel University, but after six terms - shortly before graduation - she broke off these studies. Now she moved back to Hamburg, struggling with a succession of casual jobs. For two months she worked as a stripper in the city's St. Pauli quarter. During this period her appreciation crystallised that \\"capitalism was the cause of social injustice\\". With her partner she then moved again, setting up home in Wiesbaden where she worked as a graphics assistant. After the two women's relationship broke up she took work in a succession of support roles, working variously as a tour guide, film cutter, domestic servant and barmaid.  Außerparlamentarische Opposition  In 1968 Viett relocated to the Kreuzberg district in West Berlin where she moved in to what one source describes as \\"a women's apartment\\" at number 22 \\"Eisenbahnstraße\\" (\\"Railway Street\\") with three other politically aware women, Waltraut Siepert, Anke-Rixa Hansen and Ursula Scheu. With the others she took part in meetings, demonstrations and other actions of the APO, a group of mainly student aged political activists committed to expressly \\"extra-parliamentary\\" opposition to the West German political establishment. She later wrote that a defining element in her own politicisation was a trip lasting several months that she took to North Africa. She was deeply impressed by the contrast between the poverty she encountered there and the prosperity of many in the west, along with accompanying excesses. During a street demonstration she was arrested by a civilian official after involvement in throwing a paving stone, and was held overnight in police custody. This brief experience of imprisonment, she later asserted, marked a deep break with her past. Professionally she was at the time undertaking an internship with a film copying business in order to be able to embark on an apprenticeship at a later date. But her night in the police cell led her to hand in her notice in order to devote herself to her political activism. Participation in \\"militant actions\\" followed. In the early 1970s an arson attack on the vehicle fleet of the Axel Springer publishing house failed because of \\"technical difficulties\\". She learned how to prepare and use Molotov cocktails. In December 1971 Inge Viett was one of the \\"squatters\\" involved in the occupation of the so-called Georg von Rauch House, close to her home in Berlin-Kreuzberg. When police made a move towards the house, and took up positions directly in front of it, it was her fellow squatters who prevented her from throwing Molotov cocktails at them from the roof. Other \\"actions\\" in 1971 were directed against the display windows of wedding dress shops and sex shops. On at least one occasion she undertook her actions with fellow activist Verena Becker: people clearing up the broken glass of the shop windows found printed calling cards had been left behind with the mysterious warning, \\"Die schwarze Braut kommt\\" (\\"The black bride is coming\\"). Beauty pageants in department stores were also targeted. She became involved in organised theft campaigns against department stores, sending the items stolen to those who had been arrested. During the early 1970s she moved to the \\"Liebenwalde Street\\" commune, described as a centre of \\"Schwarze Hilfe\\" (loosely: \\"Black support\\").  2 June movement  She ended up as a member of the 2 June Movement, recruited by Bommi Baumann. She moved back to her former home at 22 Eisenbahnstraße in order to escape the state surveillance to which the \\"Liebenwalde Street\\" commune was presumed to be subject. It was at the Eisenbahnstraße that she and the three others formed an activist cell which later grew to number seven members. They needed to finance their activities so started with an attack, in which Viett participated, on a bank. That was unsuccessful and had to be aborted, but a later bank attack succeeded. Following the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" killings in Derry, in January 1972 the group planned a bomb attack on a British officers' casino in Berlin. The conspirators intended that the bomb should explode during the night of 2 February 1972, but in the event it was placed by one of them, identified as a student, Harald Sommerfeld, outside the door of the adjacent address, which was a British Yacht Club. Sommerfeld omitted to activate the fuse and the bomb was found by the boat builder and Yacht Club concierge, Erwin Beelitz. Beelitz took the bomb and placed it in a clamp, apparently intending to work on it. The bomb now exploded, killing Beelitz. Viett later described her reaction as one of shock. She did not consider herself responsible for the death of Beelitz, however, which she characterised as a fatal accident. On 7 May 1972 Inge Viett was one of a number of people arrested at Bad Neuenahr in connection with alleged terrorist activities. Others detained included Ulrich Schmücker. She was held in the penitentiary at Koblenz for four months and then transferred to a women's prison along the Lehrter Straße in Berlin. From January 1973 (sources are inconsistent as to precise dates) she was participating in a five-week nationwide prisoners' hunger strike in support of demands for better conditions. Later that year, using a file that a fellow inmate had smuggled into the establishment, she was able to escape through the barred window of the first-floor television room which the prisoners were permitted to use for two hours each week. She moved for a few days into a women's residential collective and resumed her links with the 2 June Movement, devoting herself to a reorganisation of it. She also took the opportunity to learn to use a gun in Berlin's Grunewald (forest) and Tegel forest. Early on the group now attacked a gun shop, thereby upgrading their weapons collection. They then planned the kidnap of a prominent member of the political establishment as a way to apply pressure for the release of prisoners. Viett was centrally involved in the planning. Following the death of Holger Meins during the hunger strike campaign, there was a perceived need for a swift reaction. They selected as their kidnap target Günter von Drenkmann, the chairman of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce. However, the attempt, launched on 10 November 1974, went wrong. Von Drenkmann was shot, and a few hours later died in hospital. Their next target was Peter Lorenz, lead candidate for the CDU (party) in the forthcoming Berlin elections. Again, Viett was centrally involved in the planning and execution of the Lorenz kidnap. The result of the \\"action\\" was that several terrorist members of the 2 June Movement were released. Lorenz also survived and was released on 4 March 1975. After this Viett and a fellow \\"2 June\\" member fled to Beirut intending to meet up with prisoners who had been released and with other contacts who had fled to South Yemen. She spoke with Ali Hassan Salameh and with Abu Iyad, but apparently without any concrete results. After several weeks she returned to Europe. That was followed by a further visit to Lebanon where she undertook a military training course covering technical aspects of weapons, before again returning to Berlin. Later in the summer of 1975 the 2 June Movement undertook two bank attacks in West Berlin, during at least one of which they attracted additional headlines by distributing \\"chocolate kisses\\" (marshmallows coated in chocolate) to bank customers caught up in the raid. A further arrest followed on 9 September 1975. Viett was detained in a police exercise that also led to the arrests of Ralf Reinders und Juliane Plambeck. In a succession of further arrests the police now rapidly captured almost all the members of the 2 June Movement. Viett found herself back in the same cell that she had occupied before at the women's prison in Berlin's Lehrter Straße. An escape attempt on 24 December 1975 failed. She was part of a successful escape plan that was implemented on 7 July 1976 which involved getting hold of duplicate keys and overpowering two prison officials. Those who escaped also included Gabriele Rollnik, Monika Berberich und Juliane Plambeck. Berberich was recaputured while Viett and the other two travelled to Baghdad where, this time, they were reunited with some of the freed prisoners from 1975. She travelled in South Yemen where she spent three months in a Palestinian training camp. Here she adopted the cover name \\"Intissar\\". Returning to Europe, Viett and other members of the movement went to Vienna where the businessman Walter Palmers was kidnapped for ransom. He was released against a payment of slightly more than 30 million schillings. Viett escaped to Italy. Then, with the intention of carrying out another prisoner-release exercise in West Berlin, she travelled via Prague and Berlin-Schönefeld (then in East Berlin), to West Berlin. She was approached, while still in East Berlin, by officers of the Ministry for State Security who, much to her surprise, knew her real identity. A two-hour discussion followed. Since the erection in 1961 of the Berlin Wall travel between the two halves of Berlin had been severely restricted, but during her discussion Viett received assurances from Colonel Harry Dahl that the East German authorities would not be collaborating with the West German police in her case, and that she could therefore be assured of free access to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). This level of backing from the East German authorities would later turn out to be more important than would necessarily have been apparent when Viett received the assurances. On 27 May 1978 a \\"2 June commando group\\" succeeded in extracting Till Meyer from West Berlin's Moabit Jail. (An attempt to free Andreas Vogel at the same time failed.) Viett then travelled with Meyer and the commandos to East Berlin, using the Friedrichstraße frontier crossing. Weapons concealed on their bodies proved problematic, and Viett pleaded with the officials, recalling her earlier meeting with the Ministry for State Security officials. The group were permitted to enter East Germany, although the weapons had to be handed over. They then travelled on to Bulgaria. On 21 June 1978 Till Meyer, Gabriele Rollnik, Gudrun Stürmer and Angelika Goder were (re)captured by a West German anti-terrorism unit at Burgas Airport. However, Viett and two others managed to evade capture and travel to Sofia, from where they moved on to Prague. At Prague she was interrogated for three days by the Czechoslovak authorities. She then quoted a \\"cover name\\" and demanded to be put in touch with the East German authorities. As a result, three Ministry for State Security officers from East Germany turned up, removed her from her prison cell and took her back to East Germany. For two weeks she was accommodated in a Ministry property: then she was taken to Berlin Schönefeld Airport from where the authorities arranged a flight to Baghdad for her. She stayed in Baghdad for three months before returning the Europe where Inge Viett settled in Paris. She later described her own mood and that of fellow group members at this time as \\"somewhat resigned\\".  Red Army Faction  Around this time Inge Viett became involved in discussions over a possible merger of the 2 June Movement and the Red Army Faction (RAF). On 5 May 1980 Sieglinde Hofmann, Ingrid Barabass, Regina Nicolai, Karola Magg and Karin Kamp were all arrested while participating in a meeting in Paris to discuss the merger. Not for the first time, Inge Viett avoided arrest. On 2 June 1978 the 2 June Movement dissolved itself. Many of its members were now in prison. A handful of those still at liberty, including Inge Viett, decided to switch over to the RAF. Within the RAF, Viett took on responsibility for relations with the East German Ministry for State Security whose agenda evidently sometimes coincided with that of the West German terrorist group. An issue arose concerning eight \\"drop out\\" RAF members who no longer wished to participate in the group's violent activities and had become stranded without credible identity papers in Prague. Viett sought help from her Stasi contacts to have these individuals conducted to safety in \\"Black Africa\\". The Stasi expressed concern that the proposal was impractical on several levels, not leastly because the RAF \\"drop outs\\" might disclose what they knew of links between the East German ministry and the West German terrorist group. Instead the eight were invited to relocate to East Germany where they were issued with new identities and coached till they had mastered their cover stories, before being distributed across the remoter corners of East Germany and permitted to start new lives, albeit under surveillance, and without being able to contact one another. After agreeing the transfers of the eight from Prague and seeing them safely into East Germany Viett herself headed back to South Yemen to think through her own position. Within the RAF she felt herself hemmed in. After six weeks she returned to Europe and, together with three other RAF members, undertook a further stint of military training in East Germany. Then she returned to the west and lived clandestinely in a house run by the RAF in Namur in francophone Belgium.  Fatal moped incident in Paris  In August 1981 Inge Viett took a ride through Paris on a Suzuki moped that she had purchased. Regulations by this time required that moped riders should wear a helmet, but she was not wearing a helmet. Two traffic policemen signalled her to stop after she \\"jumped a traffic light\\" and she did what she could to get away from them. The policemen were on relatively powerful motor bikes and gave chase. One of them fell off, but the other continued the pursuit alone. A lengthy chase through Paris ensued, with Viett eventually abandoning her moped and making her way on foot. In a parking garage she came across one of the policemen and approached him, pointing a gun at him. According to Viett the policeman reached for his own gun at which point she shot him from a distance of around four meters. Francis Violleau, the policeman, suffered a neck injury as a result of which he was confined to a wheel chair for nineteen years after which, in 2000, he died, aged 54.Willi Winkler: Die Geschichte der RAF. 2. Aufl., Hamburg 2008, p. 381. Viett was identified from finger prints found on her moped and on her abandoned handbag, but by that time she had returned to the house in Namur. She then took another trip to South Yemen. By this time she was nurturing increasing doubts over the effectiveness of the \\"armed struggle\\". She realised that the RAF was socially isolated, and that even within the political left, any messages from its \\"actions\\" really only reached the most marginalised groups.  Flight to East Germany  In 1982 Inge Viett became the RAF's tenth (and final) \\"drop out\\" and slipped across to East Germany. For the next six months she lived in a secluded apartment provided by the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) while she prepared her new self. Her new name was \\"Eva- Maria Sommer\\". The original plan would have been to bury her West German connections, but frequent memory lapses meant she continued to use western words, such as \\"Supermarkt\\", in place of their East German equivalents, such as, here, \\"Kaufhalle\\". She was unable to master the endless acronyms specific to East Germany such as EOS, POS, NSW, SW, AWG, KWV…. The decision was therefore made to \\"relaunch\\" her as a newly arrived immigrant from West Germany. That avoided the likely pitfalls from her failure to master East German idioms, but immigrants from West Germany were vanishingly rare in East Germany and she accordingly risked standing out in any crowd on account of her western provenance. The newly arrived migrant from West Germany settled in a quarter in Dresden. While West German police feverishly sought the terrorist Inge Viett, in the Dresden quarter of Prohlis Eva-Maria Sommer started to build her new life. She undertook and completed an apprenticeship in printing and copying and took a job at the \\"Völkerfreundschaft\\" (\\"People's Friendship\\") printing shop at Riesaer Straße 32 in Dresden. She was also recruited to the Stasi's vast network of Informal collaborators. On 25 February 1983 she was logged as \\"IMB Maria Berger\\" (\\"Informal collaborator - watcher, Maria Berger\\") with the reference number XV/2385/83 for Department XXII/8. (Department XXII/8 was the ministry's sub-department for counter-terrorism.)Regine Igel: Terrorismuslügen; pp. 164–166  Dresden years  Colleagues must have realised quickly that their new comrade from the west was well connected. Just six months after taking her job, she acquired a car. Normally comrades would have had to save massively and then spend several years with their names on a waiting list before acquiring any car. Eva-Maria Sommer's car was not just any car: it was a Lada. Aware of the envy her car attracted from colleagues she then switched her Lada for a Trabant. She acquired a new life-partner with a newspaper \\"lonely hearts\\" announcement placed in Autumn 1983: \\"Seeking hiking friend for passing the hours together\\" (\\"Suche Wanderfreundin für gemeinsame Stunden...\\"). Eva-Maria Sommer's time in Dresden ended abruptly after three and a half years. One colleague had been permitted to travel to West Germany where she had found herself with time to kill at Frankfurt Station (Frankfurt a/M Hbf). Her eye was caught by a \\"wanted\\" poster featuring twelve photo- portraits of RAF terrorist suspects. Only nine of the suspects were featured since for each of three of them - presumably the most important three - there were two pictures. Two faces on the bottom row showed a girl in a long blonde wig who looked strangely familiar. The poster also mentioned a distinguishing feature for Inge Viett. There was a 1 cm scar on the right index finger: its position on the finger was described with teutonic precision. Eva-Maria Sommer was Inge Viett. Viett recognised she must disappear fast. Disclosure that East Germany was harbouring wanted West German terrorist suspects could be incalculably damaging to East Germany. The ministry organised her disappearance with characteristic speed and thoroughness: Eva-Maria Sommer's true identity remained undisclosed for another six years. She needed to think and decided to travel to South Yemen. But this time she stayed in East Germany, moving to a discreet apartment in East Berlin's Marzahn district while work began on creating another new identity for her.  Magdeburg years  Viett's new identity, which she was ready to inhabit, after nine months of preparation, in 1987, was as Eva Schnell. She was evidently by now sufficiently familiar with East German culture and phrases to be able to present herself as an East German citizen of long standing, who had worked with her husband in his small business until she was widowed. Now, in her early 40s, she was embarking on a new life in Magdeburg where she lived at an address in an apartment block along the Hans-Grundig-Straße in a quarter in the north of the city. She was employed as a group leader in a children's holiday camp run for employees of the \\"Karl-Liebknecht Heavy Machinery Conglomerate\\" (as it was known at that time). She was responsible for a budget of one million marks and a team of three co-workers: she would describe the work environment as \\"initially very tense\\". To her the operation appeared \\"larger and more complex than the entire city of Magdeburg\\", and in those early months she frequently felt she had lost control. An annual cultural high-point for Eva Schnell was the Magdeburg Cabaret which was \\"permanently sold out\\", but for which she was nevertheless able frequently to obtain tickets.  Reacting to the changes in the 1980s  After spending the first 36 years of her life as a spectacularly critical citizen of West Germany, Viett was broadly supportive of the \\"East German project\\". She was nevertheless critical, in particular, of the level of press reporting and, above all, of the political analysis that appeared in the press. Inge Viett lived in East Germany during a decade of changes which, at the time, were reported only superficially in western media. There was a rising tide of underground political protest which, as the 1980s progressed, increasingly spilled onto the streets. As the bracing winds of Glasnost swept across from, of all places, Moscow, the ruling party was no longer confident that it could rely on fraternal intervention of Soviet troops that had brutally suppressed the protests in 1953, or, in Prague in 1968. In the context of the country's important industrial sector, of which the \\"Karl-Liebknecht Heavy Machinery Conglomerate\\" was a part, industrial modernisation in the Soviet Union meant that in commercial terms the two socialist partner countries were increasingly finding themselves competing as rivals in shared export markets. Viett was critical of the changes and what came to be known as the Peaceful Revolution. She attended a \\"Monday demonstration\\" in the cathedral. Unlike others present, she found the speeches \\"aggressive\\". A \\"group of churchmen in black skirts\\" pushed her aside as they made their way past. \\"Fascist leaflets\\" were on display by the main door. Viett wondered where to find the \\"counter- revolution\\". At East Germany's first and last free and fair general election, held on 18 March 1990, Eva Schnell helped out as an election assistant at her local polling station. Innovative features of the election included giving voters a choice between several different candidate lists. Under the \\"single list\\" system used previously voters were invited to vote \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" to the party's list of candidates and then, if they exercised the right to vote \\"no\\", risking serious social and economic penalties such as being demoted or fired from their jobs or expelled from school, etc., used a different box for their voting paper. The 1990 election in March effectively marked the end of one- party dictatorship and operated as a precursor to reunification which formally took place in October 1990. The Ministry for State Security, which had sponsored Viett's presence in the country, had also been terminated. She nevertheless continued to live and work, as before, in Magdeburg even after the arrest, on 6 June 1990, of Susanne Albrecht who was the first of eight former RAF members to be found living with new identities in what was still, in June 1990, known as the German Democratic Republic.  Arrest in Magdeburg and conviction in Koblenz  On 12 June 1990 Inge Viett was arrested as she walked towards the lift/elevator in the entrance hall of the Magdeburg apartment block in which she lived. A neighbour had recognised her and reported her to the police as one of the terrorist suspects. She was held for four weeks in East Germany and then handed over to the West German authorities. Till 1990 prosecutors in West Germany had been unable to unravel with sufficient precision the roles of individual of RAF members for the series of terrorist murders that took place in 1977. After 1990, with the suspected ex-terrorists extracted from East Germany, prosecutors were able to offer reduced sentences in exchange for information that could be used to secure convictions in court. Nevertheless, when the district high court in Koblenz convicted Inge Viett in 1992, the charge was one of \\"attempted murder\\". The prosecutors had chosen to charge her not in respect of alleged terrorist offences in the 1970s, but in respect of her having shot a policeman in Paris during the summer of 1981, a case concerning which the evidence was less inscrutable. She was sentenced to thirteen years in jail.  Release  In January 1997 Viett reached the halfway point in her sentence. She was therefore released, and the remaining seven-year term was converted into a suspended sentence. Her first book, the autobiographical work \\"Nie war ich furchtloser: Autobiographie\\" had already been published by the time she emerged, and she has worked as an author since that time. She has never sought to distance herself from the \\"armed actions\\" of the Red Army Faction (RAF). The film producer Volker Schlöndorff used themes from her autobiographical work for his film Die Stille nach dem Schuss (The Legend of Rita). Viett accused him and his script-writer, Wolfgang Kohlhaase, of plagiarism. The parties reached an \\"out of court\\" settlement.  The unbowed radical  On 24 February 2007 Viett published a piece in Junge Welt in which she contextualised and defended the terrorism of the RAF. The \\"political-military struggle\\" was at that time \\"the appropriate expression for [their] opposition to capitalism\\". Looking back, she lamented the way that in the appetite for liberation \\"the guerilla fight in West Germany and in all the imperialist countries excluded from the headlines the more experienced, intelligent, persistent and constructitive aspects\\" of the movement. The \\"armed actions\\" by the RAF represented one element as \\"class struggle from below\\". Forty years ago there was a small collection of people who took the decision to take up the struggle against the German elite and their power structure. Viett asserted that they were motivated by anti-colonialism and national liberation movements. On 28 July 2008 Viett was briefly arrested at a demonstration against the German army being held at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. A few months later, following criticism by politicians, she was quoted in the Berlin edition mass market Bild newspaper defending her involvement, \\"That was an anti-militarist action. And every anti-militarist action is good.\\" Eventually she faced trial, on 22 October 2009. Noting that she was \\"a pensioner\\", the court released Viett on the original charges but fined her 225 Euros for \\"resisting the power of the state\\" (\\"Widerstand gegen die Staatsgewalt\\"), reflecting the manner in which she had resisted the police arresting her. On 8 January 2011 Viett participated in a panel discussion at the International Rosa Luxemburg Conference in Berlin. The press were in attendance. She called for the construction of a \\"revolutionary communist organisation with secret structures\\". That was all part of a \\"kämpferische Praxis\\", a (barely) nuanced phrase capable of interpretation as a call for violence. \\"Bourgeois legal structures\\" (\\"bürgerliche Rechtsordnung\\") could not set the standards in this context. \\"If Germany conducts war, and German army weaponry is torched in an anti-war action, then the action is a legitimate one: so is sabotaging munitions stores. Wildcat strikes, occupation of businesses or homes, militant anti-fascist actions, countering police attacks etc....\\". The CDU lawyer- politician Wolfgang Bosbach, at that time chairman of the parliamentary home affairs committee, went on record with his opinion that this amounted to a \\"call for a violent struggle against the state\\" (einen \\"Aufruf zum gewaltsamen Kampf gegen den Staat\\"). In November 2011 a Berlin district court fined Viett 1200 Euros for \\"endorsing criminal acts\\" (\\"Billigung von Straftaten\\").  Published output (selection)  * Einsprüche!

During World War I they were part of the 9th (Secunderabad) Division in the 27th Bangalore Brigade. This brigade served away from its parent division and served in British East Africa as part of the Indian Expeditionary Force B. After returning to India they took part in the Third Afghan War. After World War I the Indian government reformed the army moving from single battalion regiments to multi battalion regiments.Sumner p.15 In 1922, the 61st Pioneers now became the 1st Battalion 1st Madras Pioneers, which was disbanded in 1933.

It was one of the pievi, or isolated churches with baptistries, among which the territory of Val Camonica was divided. The complex, which stands on a ridge overlooking the river Oglio, can be reached via a staircase built in the 1930s. The foundation of the church in its present form probably dates to the end of the 11th century, although a fragment of a Roman inscription on a lancet window suggests that a Roman building was previously located on the site, and later converted into a house of Christian worship between the eighth and ninth centuries. In the crypt elements are present in pre-Romanesque capitals and columns. The bell-tower appears to be an addition of the fifteenth century. Following the visit to Val Camonica of St. Charles Borromeo in 1580 some parts of the church were rebuilt, including the ceiling of the nave. Major works of restoration began in 1912 under the auspices of the state. Fragments of stone which had fallen from the portal were returned to place, the whole north wall of the choir was rebuilt and both the cross-vaulting of the aisles and the coffering of the nave were done away with. The walls of the crypt and its access stair were also rebuilt. In a later restoration the pavements of the nave and crypt were raised and remade using slabs of local stone. In the early 1990s structural works were undertaken to secure the building and its campanile. The structure has an east–west orientation, with three apses, and a very elaborate entrance on the south side, carved with symbols and fantastic flowers. Inside, the sanctuary is elevated from the central nave and the two side aisles. Even in the crypt the subdivision in three apses is maintained. On the back wall to the west there are a number of steps that had to serve, according to tradition, catechumens. From these leads to a door that went into the sacristy and the bell tower. From this church comes the altarpiece of the Master Paroto stored at New York City, signed and dated 1447 (or 1444).Millard Meiss, \\"An early Lombard altarpiece\\", Arte antica e moderna 13/16 (1961:125-33), The large baptismal font inside the church is probably formed from the basin of a Roman or early medieval wine press.‘Sulle orme dei camuni’, Valcamonica: escursioni, Banca Popolare di Sondrio.

He made his film debut in 1935 with Dhuwandhar, and went on to play character roles in both Hindi mainstream and arthouse films. He was also cast in small parts in a few international productions such as Maya (1966), The Guru (1969) and Gandhi (1982). Palshikar was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor twice, in 1962 and 1965. He was recognised with an award in the same category by the Bengal Film Journalists' Association in 1965. Career Palshikar made his first film appearance in 1935 along with Leela Chitnis in Sukumar Chatterjee's Dhurandhar. He appeared in two more films in this decade, Kangan and Durga (1939), both of which were produced at the Bombay Talkies production house and were the two final films directed by German director Franz Osten. After a long break of 14 years, between which he appeared only in one film Bahurani (1940), he returned to the screen in Bimal Roy's 1953 picture Do Bigha Zamin (Two Acres of Land), in which he played Dhangu Maheto, alongside actors such as Balraj Sahni and Nirupa Roy. The film was a major critical success and won several national and international honours. He followed it with supporting roles in other successful films of this decade, such as V. Shantaram's Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje, Bimal Roy's Devdas, Raj Kapoor's Shree 420, Sombhu Mitra's Jagte Raho and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Anari. In 1960, Palshikar appeared in Kanoon, a courtroom drama involving a murder case. Directed by B. R. Chopra, the film saw Palshikar playing Kaalia, a petty thief who is caught and charged with murder for no fault of his own. Palshikar's performance earned him his first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. In a retrospective review in 2009, The Hindu noted: \\"the star of the second half is Nana Palshikar, who slips into the role of a petty thief with a commanding performance.\\" In 1963, Palshikar appeared in Khwaja Ahmad Abbas's Shehar Aur Sapna (The City and The Dreams). It is a social film which portrays the struggle of pavement dwellers in the backdrop of rapid industrialisation. The film, a love story that takes place in a drain pipe, received the President's Gold Medal Award and the National Film Award for Best Feature Film. Palshikar's performance as Johnny earned him his second Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, and he was acknowledged as Best Supporting Actor (Hindi) by the Bengal Film Journalists' Association. John Berry's Maya (1966) saw Palshikar playing Sajid Khan's father. In 1969, James Ivory cast him in the foreign co-production The Guru. Ivory said: \\"I didn't know a great deal about him when we cast him... He was said to be a very good actor, which I took on faith.\\" Judith Crist from the New York Magazine described his small part of \\"The Guru's Guru\\" in the film as \\"an unforgettable cameo\\". In the 1970s, Palshikar continued to portray father figures or authoritative characters such as judges. For instance, he played a father in many films such as B. R. Chopra's Dhund, based on Agatha Christie's play The Unexpected Guest in 1973 and Yaaron Ka Yaar in 1977. However, these roles were generally relatively minor and he was often uncredited for his performances, such as his role as a judge in Jwar Bhata in 1972. He continued playing a father into the 1980s, appearing in Aakrosh (1980), playing Om Puri's dad. His last major film was in the epic film Gandhi in 1982, a Richard Attenborough directed biographical film based on the life of Mohandas Gandhi, who led the nonviolent resistance movement against British colonial rule in India during the first half of the 20th century. However, his role was very minor, playing a villager. His last ever appearance was shortly before his death in 1984 in the film Kanoon Kya Karega, again playing a parent. He died on 1 June 1984 in Bombay, aged 77.

This was another production that saw constant meddling from Hearst. He fired director Clarence Badger and brought in George W. Hill and Joseph Urban and re-shot extensive sections of the film. He reportedly burned the original footage. Hearst wanted the sand storm finale to outdo the storm scene in D. W.

The film was a hit. Davies recalled a circus sequence in which she was to enter the cage of a lion. She was so terrified of the lion that she refused to do the scene. Charlie Chaplin, whom she had recently met in Hollywood and who was visiting the set, supposedly donned her costume and did the scene with the lion. Davies' longtime assistant, however, claimed the scene was more likely done by a stuntwoman. The scene is not in the surviving print, but there are production stills showing Davies in a circus setting. This was the third and final teaming of Davies with Harrison Ford.Lorusso, Edward (2017) The Silent Films of Marion Davies, CreateSpace, p. 109.

Due to the angle and depth of the anthracite in this part of Wales, Pentremawr was a slant mine, and hence access and extraction of the coal did not need a shaft. However, the commercial extraction of coal is limited by geological faults in the area. The first two attempts were aborted in 1870, after a huge fault was encountered. But eventually three slants known as Capel Ifan No's 1, 2 and 3 were opened to the Gwendraeth, Braslyd, Gras and Trichwart seams. By 1896, there were 160 men working at the colliery, and it was during this time of operation that Colliery Chief Mechanic Jones Jones (1879–1976), invented the renowned Pontyberem safety lamp.Mining-Memorabilia http://www.mining- memorabilia.co.uk/Pontyberem-Part%20II.htm In 1913, a fourth slant was driven to work the Pumquart seam, and so by 1923 there were 956 men working at the colliery. In 1927, Pentremawr Colliery Company Ltd. was absorbed into the Amalgamated Anthracite Combine, with records showing that 1,007 men employed. The company ploughed in money to fix problems associated with the initial local geological fault, resulting in the discovery of the Big Vein seam in 1939. Post World War II, in 1956 900 men produced 226,273 tons. Due to the geological faults in the area, the mine was susceptible to incursion from methane gas. Two miners were killed from explosions caused by methane gas and coal dust explosions in 1945, and one in 1965. But on 1 September 1966, Pentremawr was the site of the largest outburst of methane and fine coal dust in the UK, when 1,000 tons of coal dust erupted from the Big Vein: no one was killed on that occasion. However, on 6 April 1971, six men were killed and 69 others suffered varying degrees of asphyxia. Developing geological problems brought about the closure of the No.4 Pumquart slant in 1968. In 1974, the National Coal Board amalgamated Pentremawr with the Cynheidre Colliery, which itself closed in 1989. Proposed opencast development In 2009, Draeth Developments proposed developing the site of Pentremawr to extract 300,000 tonnes of coal via an opencast mining development. Opposed by local residents and Llanelli MP Nia Griffith and AM Helen Mary Jones, the scheme is subject to planning permission.

When the Cabinet-Ekman I resigned in September 1928, Gustav Rosén returned to Umeå - first as political editor of VK and from 1931 until his death in 1942 as County Governor of Västerbotten County. Bäckström In 1929 Rosén sold the majority of his shares to master builder J.M. Bäckström, who began building a new publishing house the following year at the block Rind, at Rådhusesplanaden 10 in central Umeå. The VK building was completed by the end of 1930/1931 and housed VK until 1988. In 1949 VK was the first news paper in Norrland to hire its own press photographer, Harry Lindwall, who would remain in service until his retirement in 1985. VK was owned by the Bäckström family until 1971, 15 years after the death of JM Bäckström. After a disagreement between the Sundsvall branch of the heirs (who wanted to sell) and the Umeå branch (who wanted to keep the VK as a liberal and freethinking news paper) the paper was first sold to the small printing company Folk och Samhälle (People and Society) and later around 1978 to the Stiftelsen VK-Press (VK- Press Foundation). Modern era In 1982, VK bought land in the industrial area Västerslätt to build a new printing house. The printing house got a boost when the newspaper Dagens Nyheter decided to have their Norrland edition printed there. The printing house was opened in autumn 1984 and a few years later, in 1988, another printing house in the same area. In the 1990s and 2000s VK faced competition from the Norrländska Socialdemokraten (NSD, Norrland Social-Democrats) based in Luleå for the title of largest daily news paper of Norrland. VK also became the majority owner of its competitor Västerbottens Folkblad in 2001. In 2003 the ownership increased to 91%. In 2003 VK acquired the magazine Nöjesmagasinet City, a free magazine focused on entertainment, trend and lifestyle that is published in different editions for Umeå, Sundsvall and Luleå. In December 2012 VK had 199 staff. The paper started the website VK.se in 1997, which was built by editor Tom Juslin. It was twice (2007 and 2008) nominated for the Stora Journalistpriset prize in the category Innovator of the Year. Circulation The circulation of VK was 34,700 copies in 2010. The paper had a circulation of 32,400 copies in 2012 and 30,800 copies in 2013. VK-guldet Since 1937 the newspaper annually honor the best sportsman or sportswoman from Västerbotten with the so-called VK-guldet (VK Gold). Among the prizewinners are Ingemar Stenmark, Anja Pärson, Marta Vieira da Silva and Assar Rönnlund.

Since then, any airline within the European Economic Area is free to operate any domestic or international route. Braathens rejected a proposal from the main competitor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) for a merger; instead the helicopter division was sold and the company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. New routes were opened from Oslo Airport, Fornebu to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, but the routes from Bergen to these cities were terminated. International routes to Rome, Nice and Jersey were introduced. In 1996, Braathens SAFE bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede, and started flying on the Oslo–Stockholm route. The following year, Transwede, with its five domestic routes, was merged into Braathens SAFE. The same year, KLM bought 30% of Braathens SAFE and the airlines started a partnership. In 1998, the airline changed its name to Braathens and introduced two-class cabins. Full-fare passengers traveled in the \\"Best\\"-class, while discounted travelers traveled in the \\"Back\\"-class. It also bought the Swedish airline Malmö Aviation. Oslo Airport, Gardermoen replaced Fornebu as the airline's main hub, and a price war started against SAS and the new low-cost airline Color Air. The availability of slots increased the frequency of flights for all three airlines to an unsustainable level. After a year, Color Air was bankrupt, but Braathens had suffered large losses, and terminated many routes, including all services in Sweden. In 2001, the airline was bought by SAS, and the following year the two coordinated their services so as not to compete. On 1 May 2004, they merged to create SAS Braathens, that re-branded to Scandinavian Airlines in 2007. Deregulation A Braathens SAFE Boeing 737-500 The deregulation process, which would eliminate the need for concessions for routes, was driven by Norway's application for membership of the EU. This was supported by the Labor Party and the right-winged Conservative Party and Progress Party. The plans from the EU indicated that international routes within EU should be deregulated from 1 January 1993, with Norway and Sweden joining from 1 July. Full, domestic liberalization should be performed by 1 April 1997. SAS and Braathens SAFE proposed a solution where only Norwegian airlines could compete until 1997, which was thought to efficiently hinder other airlines, rather than these two, until then. SAS announced its support for competition on 4 February 1993, while Braathens SAFE stated that it no longer was in favor of competition, despite having arguing for this for the whole of the company's history. The company stated that stability was needed and that competition would result in marginalized routes, that were being cross-subsidized, being closed. SAS stated that with competition, prices would fall 20–30%, and that SAS wanted to operate with a loss to force Braathens SAFE close services.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 320–322 During the discussion about deregulation, Braathens SAFE considered several possibilities to strengthen itself. In particular, it had discussions with the large European airlines Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM about an alliance, but these were rejected by Braathens SAFE, stating that the agreements were all about getting traffic to the partner's hub. Minister of Transport, Kjell Opseth and director of SAS in Norway, Jan Reinås, both proposed a merger between Braathens SAFE and SAS, to ensure that the company had a 100% market share on the primary routes before the merger. This would, according to them, secure that no foreign company could compete with the merged company. The proposal was rejected by Braathens SAFE's management. Still, negotiations started between the companies in 1992, although they were quickly abandoned. The press reported the price of Braathens SAFE to be NOK 1.2 billion, but that this had been rejected as too expensive by SAS.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 308–317 Prior to a government report being presented on 30 March 1993, SAS had launched 1 November 1993 as their preferred date of free competition, while Braathens SAFE had launched 1 April 1997 as their preferred date. Braaathens SAFE was worried that the high debt the company had due to the purchase of new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war. Bjørn G. Braathen stated that the company had bought the new aircraft based on the belief that deregulation would occur in 1997, giving the airline time to pay more of the debt. On 2 June 1993, with 76 against 18 votes, parliament voted to deregulate the domestic airline market from 1 April 1994. It was supported by the Labor, Conservative and Progress Party. With this, Norway became the third country in Europe to fully deregulate, after Sweden and the United Kingdom.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 327–334 Both Braathens SAFE and SAS had been cross-subsidizing their routes. Through the regulations, the airlines had agreed to fly to unprofitable airports, in exchange for making higher profits on other routes. With free competition, this would not be followed, and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not profitable. To finance these, a NOK 10 fee would be charged on all primary routes. The cost of collecting this fee was so high that SAS and Braathens SAFE announced it was cheaper to continue to fly to the unprofitable airports. Braathens SAFE stated that their routes Haugesund–Bergen and Oslo–Røros–Trondheim were not profitable.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 334–335 A Braathens employee working on a CFM International CFM56 turbofan engine To meet the free market situation, the company's management introduced measures to keep costs low. On 19 August 1993, ten of eleven trade unions agreed to a three-year wage contract, which contained bonuses for all employees based on the company's profit. The cabin crew's union had a two-day strike, before reaching an agreement. At the same time, the company needed NOK 400 million in share capital. Braathens Rederi sold the sister company Braathens Helikopter to Helkopter Service for NOK 225 million on 30 September 1993, and the money was used to buy Braathens SAFE stock. The company raised further capital in an initial public offering, and the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 10 January 1994. After the listing, Braathens Rederi retained 69% of the company.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 336–339 On 1 April, Braathens SAFE increased the number of services. The daily number of flights from Oslo to Bergen increased to nine, and the airline introduced four new services to Northern Norway from Oslo: two each to Tromsø and Harstad/Narvik. Later, the frequency to Tromsø increased to four, and from 28 June there were also two daily round trips to Bodø. SAS increased its services on the routes from Oslo to Stavanger and Trondheim, and from Bergen to Stavanger. The liberalization did not result in a price war, and prices remained constant.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 340–341 The following two years, Braathens SAFE also introduced scheduled international flights to Rome, as well as summer routes to Jersey and Nice. However, Braathens SAFE terminated their routes from Bergen to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, making the passengers switch planes in Trondheim. In 1995, Braathens signed agreements with many of the large companies in Norway as a prioritized airline. Several of the contracts had been secured by the airline offering discounts to the companies in exchange for not allowing their customers to collect frequent flyer points. SAS had not allowed this scheme, and had lost companies such as Statoil, Aker and the Government of Norway. Expansion into Sweden Braathens Boeing 737-300 in hybrid Transwede livery—this was the only -300 operated by Braathens In 1996, Braathens SAFE started negotiations to purchase the Swedish airline Transwede Airways from its owners, Transpool. After SAS had bought Linjeflyg, Transwede had become the second-largest domestic airline in Sweden, operating five Fokker 100s. In 1995, Braathens SAFE had a revenue of NOK 4 billion, with a profit of NOK 242 million. The same year, Transwede had lost NOK 200 million with a revenue of NOK 1.2 billion. The company had been split in two, a charter and a scheduled company, and Braathens SAFE started negotiating to purchase the scheduled company. Transwede's scheduled services were at the time form Stockholm-Arlanda Airport to Halmstad, Jönköping, Luleå, Sundsvall and Umeå, plus a service from Luleå to Sundsvall. It had a 13% market share, transporting 800,000 people in 1995, and had been through a major restructuring the year before, where the fleet had been reduced from seven to five aircraft. On 18 June, Braathens SAFE announced that starting on 27 October, the company put one aircraft into service on the route from Oslo to Stockholm. SAS had at the time fifteen round trips on the route, and Braathens planned to introduce seven. The route was considered one of the most profitable for SAS. The purchase of Transwede was confirmed on 25 June; Braathens SAFE bought 50% of the company's scheduled division, Transwede Airways, with an option to purchase the rest in 1997. The companies planned to integrate their networks, to allow connection between Braathens SAFE's and Transwede flights at Stockholm. Services to Stockholm started on 6 November; after three months, the airline had captured 14% of the Oslo–Stockholm market. In 1996, Braathens SAFE had a 51% domestic market share in Norway, transporting 9.5 million passengers. On 3 February 1997, the airline announced it had ordered six 134-seat Boeing 737-700 aircraft for NOK 1.5 billion. These aircraft would be delivered in 1998, prior to the opening of the new airport at Gardermoen. In addition, the airline had an option for additional ten planes to be delivered after 2000. In 1997, Transwede started replacing its Fokker 100s with Boeing 737s. In May 1997, Braathens SAFE was criticized by the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association because it was using retired Braathens SAFE pilots to fly Transwede aircraft, due to Transwede not having certified pilots for their new Boeing 737-300. Braathens SAFE stated that this was within the rules of the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration and the Joint Aviation Authorities. Fokker 100 in combined Braathens and Malmö Aviation livery In 1997, SAS announced that it was going to reduce its commission to travel agents from 9 to 5%. Braathens followed, reducing from 8 to 5% from 1 January 1998. However, to try to attract more business passengers, the airline retained the 8% commission on their international routes. At the same time, the Government of Norway abandoned its old regime of negotiating prices with the airlines for state-employed civil servants' flights. Instead, they introduced an annual tender for the routes. It was awarded to SAS, who also won all subsequent tenders. For Braathens SAFE, this meant that state-employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did not fly. The contract was worth NOK 500 million for SAS. On 1 April 1997, the European airline market was fully deregulated. At this time, British Airways announced increased activity to Scandinavia, based in part on a cooperation with Braathens SAFE concerning their frequently flyer program; holders of Bracard were allowed to collect frequent flyer points on British Airways' flights. On 3 April, Braathens SAFE, Transwede and Finnair signed an agreement involving codesharing on Finnair's flights from Stockholm and Oslo to Helsinki, Bracard members would be granted points on Finnair flights, and Braathens SAFE took over Finnair's handling services in Oslo. On 18 December, Braathens SAFE bought the remaining half of Transwede, paying 2 Swedish krona for the who company. However, due to an agreement about converting debt into share capital, the company was sold for SEK 13 million. With the take-over, the company changed its name to Braathens Sverige AB. At the same time, management announced that they planned to replace all the company's Fokker 100s with 737-300s. Partnership and new identity A Braathens SAFE Boeing 737-400 with special 50-year anniversary markings On 18 August 1997, Braathens SAFE announced a strategic partnership with the Dutch airline KLM. The partnership replaced the agreement with British Airways, and became active in 1998. Analysts stated that the partnership came as a reaction to SAS' alliance with Lufthansa, the Star Alliance, that had been created the previous year. Braathens SAFE had also been in negotiations with British Airways. The agreement involved KLM purchasing a 30% stake in Braathens SAFE from Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi for NOK 800 million. In addition, Braathens SAFE started flying from several Norwegian cities to KLM's main hub at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. In addition, the partnership involved a coordination of scheduling, prices, frequent flyer programs, corporate customer agreements, maintenance and procurement. The partnership also involved cooperation with the American airline Northwest Airlines. In 1997, Braathens SAFE and Transwede had a revenue of NOK 5.4 billion and made a profit of NOK 206 million, down 88 million from 1996. Starting in March, Braathens SAFE took over KLM's routes from Stavanger to Amsterdam, and started a new route from Trondheim to Amsterdam. From 26 March 1998, Braathens SAFE moved its flights to London from Gatwick to London Stansted Airport. At the same time, it announced that the number of daily services from Oslo to London would increase from one to three, following the opening of Gardermoen. In addition, KLM-partner AirUK would become an agent for Braathens SAFE, and the company hoped that 40% of the sales on the route would be sold in the United Kingdom. The agreement also involved a codesharing agreement with AirUK, including some onwards flights from London, notably the route to Dublin. At the same time, Braathens SAFE announced that the airline would start selling more discounted tickets on the London-flights, to compete with Ryanair's new route from Stanstad to Sandefjord Airport, Torp. In 1997, Braathens changed its name and introduced a new livery, here seen on a Boeing 737-700 On 23 March 1998, Braathens SAFE changed its name and corporate identity to Braathens. It introduced a new livery with a blue bottom, and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract, silver wing, that became the company's new logo. The re-branding was an attempt to create an international identity, and tone down the Norwegian national symbols that had been on the airplanes since 1946. At the same time, a two-class configuration was introduced: the 'Best' section, accounting for 70% of the planes capacity, received higher seat pitch, complimentary in- flight drinks, meals and newspapers, priority boarding and refundable tickets. The 'Back' section was for discount ticket holders, who received a no-frills service with a smaller seat pitch, and were located at the back of the aircraft behind a curtain. Best tickets became NOK 300 more expensive, while it became easier to purchase discounted tickets. The scheme was, according to Erik G. Braathen, an attempt to differentiate between the full-fare customers, with whom Braathens was competing with SAS, and the low-fare customers, who Braathens was competing with Ryanair and the to-be established Color Air. The scheme as first introduced on the first 737-700 that was delivered. The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions encouraged its 800,000 members to not fly with Braathens due to the introduction of a segregated classes. SAS did not follow the same policy, and offered its discounted customers to travel in the same class as Braathens', including complimentary service. After introduction, the concept increased the work load on handing employees, who needed to check the passengers' tickets to ensure they sat in the right class. There were also complaints from Best-passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced. The domestic concourse at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, with planes from Braathens, Scandinavian Airlines and Color Air On 17 August 1998, Braathens bought Malmö Aviation, that flew from Stockholm-Bromma Airport to Göteborg Landvetter Airport and Malmö Airport. In addition, it served all three airports from London City Airport. The airline had eleven British Aerospace 146 jets. In 1997, it had 772,000 passengers, 450 employees, a revenue of SEK 900 million and a profit of SEK 40 million. The airline cost SEK 600 million and the deal gave Braathens and Malmö Aviation a 25% domestic market share in Sweden. Price war In January 1998, Olav Nils Sunde, owner of the cruiseferry company Color Line, announced that he would start a domestic low-cost airline. They company aimed for a 15–20% domestic market share and was named Color Air. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend. From 1 April, a new NOK 65 tax was introduced on all domestic flights. Braathens and SAS decided to divide the cross-subsidize the taxes between their routes, something Color Air was not able to do. This was because the tax was only valid for routes within Southern Norway; Braathens and SAS could therefore tacitly collude to increase the prices to Northern Norway, and thereby subsidize their routes in Southern Norway. Color Air on the other hand would be forced to put the full tax on all its departures. While the government had no way to hinder the incumbents from doing this, Gudmund Restad, Minister of Finance from the Center Party, encouraged the airlines to not \\"cheat\\", and follow the intentions of the law, even if he admitted that there was nothing the government could do to hinder the airlines from cross-subsidizing. Color Air started with flights from Gardermoen on 1 August, two months before the airport opened. Gardermoen was taken into use on 8 October by SAS and Braathens. Both immediately increased the number of flights. Braathens established a route to Haugesund, while SAS started routes to Ålesund and Kristiansand. The number of daily trips from Oslo for SAS increased from 59 to over 80. In total, the three companies increased their daily round trip from 138 to 200, and the daily seat capacity from 18,000 to 26,000. Ålesund had the largest increase, from seven daily round trips with only Braathens, to seventeen offered by all three companies. Braathens bought Malmö Aviation in 1998 In late 1998 and early 1999, KLM and Braathens introduced direct flights from Sandefjord and Kristiansand to Amsterdam. Braathens also started flights from Sandefjord to Stavanger and Bergen.Tjomsland, 2005: 212 On 1 May 1999, Northwest Airlines started flights to its hub at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in the United States. This service was terminated in October. The Northwest service had a connection to Stockholm as well as a new route from Oslo to Gothenburg, operated by Braathens. After Northwest announced the withdrawal of their service, the Gothenburg service was also terminated. In November 1998, Color Air introduced a new cheapest ticket for NOK 345. After the winter settled, the ice front between Color Air and Braathens grew colder following Braathens' denying Color Air to use their deicing equipment at Ålesund, resulting in the plane being stuck at the airport. By the end of 1998, it became clear that Braathens had increased capacity with 20%, but only achieved a 5.2% ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen. Similar numbers were applicable for SAS. The business market, in particular the large corporations with divisions in several cities, were demanding high frequencies on the routes. Color Air could get by with fewer departures, because they mainly targeted the leisure segment. In particular, the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization; to Ålesund there were 1.2 million flown seats annually, but only 345,000 passengers, giving a 29% cabin load. In September 1999, SAS announced that if Braathens took the first step to reduce capacity between Bergen and Oslo, they would follow immediately to reduce the overcapacity in the combined 37 daily departures. However, Braathens was not willing to reduce. On 15 September, Color Air announced that they would start flying five round trips from Oslo to Stavanger on 1 October, following the delivery of their fourth aircraft. At the same time, the airline would reduce the number of round trips to Ålesund from four to two. In January 1999, Braathens applied to register twenty of its Norwegian aircraft in Sweden, following their discovery that foreign-registered aircraft, such as Color Air's and SAS', did not have to pay value added tax on good sold on board. This was rejected by the Norwegian Armed Forces, who based their need of transport of military personnel during wartime on requisition of civilian, Norwegian-registered aircraft. The same month, Geir Olsen, head of Braathens in Sweden, withdrew from his position, due to disagreements about the corporate strategy. On 27 September 1999, Color Air terminated all flights and ceased operations. On the day of the termination, the stock price of Braathens increased by 16%. Immediately following the bankruptcy, the two airlines increased their prices. Subsequently, Braathens increased their ticket price by 15%, but stated that this had nothing to do with the elimination of competition, since the price increase was not on any Oslo routes. In November, Braathens started to remove routes, and announced they would increase prices by 20%. They also reintroduced the Flag of Norway on the tail, which since the rebranding had been replaced by a silver, abstract wing. Both Braathens and SAS lost more than NOK 1 billion in 1999, totaling the cost of the price war between the three airlines to exceed NOK 3 billion. Crisis Boeing 737-400 at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. This was the last livery used by Braathens, modified with the re-introduction of the Norwegian flag on the tailplane. On 23 July 1999, Braathens replaced its CEO with Arne A. Jensen. He introduced the program Improve 800, that was to improve the bottom line with NOK 800 million. In February 1999, Braathens merged the Swedish division with Malmö Aviation, to create Braathens Malmö Aviation. At the same time, the airline removed the 'Best' and 'Back' scheme on domestic Swedish flights. In November, Braathens terminated all services in Sweden that were inherited from Transwede. The Fokker 100 aircraft and Boeing 737-300 aircraft were sold, and the service from Oslo to Stockholm taken over by the company's Norwegian department. Malmö Aviation retained on flights from Stockholm-Bromma to Gothenburg and Malmö, as well as to London City. In addition, a Stockholm to Halmstad Airport service was started. In 1999, Braathens lost SEK 300 million in Sweden, bringing the total loss of Braathens Swedish operations since 1996 to SEK 600 million. At the same time, Braathens terminated its services from Sandefjord to Stavanger and Bergen, and the route from Oslo to Haugesund. From 25 June 2000, the company also terminated its Oslo to Stockholm route. Instead, the planes were put into service to Málaga and Alicante. During 1999, domestic air ticket prices increased 9.2%, and another 17% the following year. By 2001, the domestic capacity was below the level before Gardermoen opened. Braathens and SAS started cooperating to set the full-price tickets on routes to eleven cities. This meant that the prices were identical on all the routes where both airlines flew, although they were not allowed to make such cooperation with discounted tickets. During the crisis, Braathens had sold several aircraft and started leasing them back to gain liquidity. The company announced in 2000 that they were considering purchasing a smaller type of aircraft, that would replace the 737s on some routes, and that would allow Braathens to start operating the Norwegian Air Shuttle services themselves. The 'Best' and 'Back' service was highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE had a strong image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE was seen as the people's airline. It also drew goodwill from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly in the beginning of the service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew. On 25 November 2000, Braathens terminated the route to Murmansk. On 2 January 2001, they also terminated the routes from Molde to Kristiansand and from Kristiansand to Trondheim, the routes to Røros from Trondheim and Oslo, and the services from Oslo to Newcastle. The routes from Bergen to Haugesund were reduced from five to three round trips, and the Bergen–Molde–Trondheim route was reduced from four to three. The capacity on the routes from Oslo to Molde and Kristiansund were increased. A second round trip was introduced from Stavanger to Newcastle, flown by Norwegian Air Shuttle. From 15 February, the airline introduced four weekly services from Oslo to Barcelona, and from 1 March, three weekly round trips to directly from Longyearbyen to Oslo. A direct service was introduced from Bergen to Alicante from 7 April. Take-over Boeing 737-400 in 2004; the Braathens livery is still in use, but with the subtext \\"Member of the SAS Group\\" On 21 May 2001, SAS and Braathens announced that KLM and Braathens Rederi had agreed to sell their 69% stake in Braathens for NOK 800 million to SAS—valuating Braathens to NOK 1.1 billion. Braathens had contacted British Airways, but they had stated that they did not wish to purchase Braathens. The deal with SAS was initiated by Braathens; they stated that this would allow the two companies to cooperate to eliminate the overcapacity in the domestic market. Because both airlines operated a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, about NOK 150 million could be saved in maintenance. The agreement also involved that Malmö Aviation would have to be sold before the take-over. If not, the Braathens family would purchase the airline for NOK 1\\\\. At the same time, the family-owned companies guaranteed for about NOK 1 billion in the Swedish subsidiary. The Norwegian Competition Authority announced that since the new company would have all domestic scheduled services between primary airports, it was unlikely that the take- over would receive permission from them. However, it was stated that one solution could be that the companies discontinue their frequent flyer programs. On 20 August, the Competition Authority declared that SAS was not allowed to purchase Braathens; the ruling was appealed by SAS and Braathens. Analysts stated that Braathens could be bankrupt by the time the appeal was processed. The Competition Authority stated that their denial of the take-over was that the reduction of capacity would remove the airline's incentive to provide discounted tickets, because they would not have to use them to capture travelers with lower willingness to pay from the competitor, and that they would not need low-paying customers to fill up the vacant seats. Instead, the authority wanted the politicians to reduce the taxes on flights. While Braathens also was opposed to the tax, they felt that removing it then was too late to save the company. CEO Arne A. Jensen stated to the press that he felt that the cause of the problems were made in 1993, when the airline failed to make the correct choices in relation to the deregulation. He stated that he felt that part of the cause was that KLM and the Braathens family had cancelled a planned private placement. He further stated that a monopoly was the best for society, the passengers and the employees. He also stated that if the appeal failed, he had a \\"Plan B\\", involving a much smaller airline that would compete with SAS on the main routes. From October, the airline terminated its service to Milan and reduced capacity on some domestic routes; this removed the need for two aircraft. In addition, the airline increased all ticket prices with 5%, due to higher insurance costs. On 23 October 2001, the Competition Authority granted permission for SAS to purchase Braathens. The rationale was that there were no other realistic purchasers for the airline, and that a bankruptcy was imminent without the take-over. As a condition, the authority decided to regulate a ban on frequent flyer programs, and stated that it would ban cross-subsidization aimed at underbidding or operating at a loss to force new entrants out of the market. Coordinated operation A SAS Braathens Boeing 737-500 By then, SAS had taken sixteen aircraft out of service, reduced production with 12% and fired 1,000 employees. The airline stated that they wished to renegotiate the agreement with the Braathens family and KLM to reduce the price. Because there had arrisen a situation with high over-capacity of aircraft, the value of planes had fallen. In addition, SAS demanded that Braathens reduce its fleet from 33 to 23 aircraft if the deal was to go through, threatening to terminate the purchase if the airline did not abide. On 2 April 2002, SAS and Braathens split all the routes between them. SAS started flying on the main-haul routes from Oslo to Trondheim, Bergen and Stavanger, with only a few flights to Stavanger flown by Braathens to get planes to the technical base there. From Oslo and Trondheim to Northern Norway, all routes were taken over by Braathens, with exception of a few flights made by SAS to Tromsø and Bodø. SAS also withdrew their flights from Oslo to Kristiansand and Ålesund, and Braathens increased their frequency on the route. Braathens retained the routes it had flown where SAS had not formerly flown. Braathens also kept the international flights to Barcelona, Nice, Málaga and Alicante. This reduced the overcapacity in the market, and allowed the SAS Group to save between NOK 600 and 900 million. For a short period, members of both Wings and SAS' EuroBonus could collect points from the other airlines. But from 1 July, the awarding of frequent flyer miles on domestic flights was no longer permitted. From 1 April 2003, the West Coast routes, which had been on contract with Norwegian Air Shuttle, were taken over by SAS Commuter. On 24 April 2002, SAS announced that all handling services operated by Braathens would be taken over by SAS Ground Services. All SAS employees would be prioritized in the rationalization process, and 800 Braathens employees were laid off. Three hundred Braathens' employees were offered jobs with SAS Ground Services, but these lost their seniority. No employees in SAS lost their jobs. The case ended in the courts, where 369 former Braathens employees sued SAS to receive the same seniority as they had in Braathens. On 15 October 2003, Asker and Bærum District Court decided that only 42 of the employees, those working in Kristiansund and Molde, had right to keep their seniority. The case was appealed, and on 18 March 2005, Borgarting Court of Appeal, with four against three votes, decided in favor of SAS, denying the employees their claim. The matter was not settled until 31 January 2006, when the Supreme Court of Norway ruled in favor of the employees. By 2004, Braathens had managed to cut costs sufficiently to make a profit. At the same time, SAS was having problems making a profit. SAS announced on 10 March 2004 that SAS and Braathens would be merged into a single company, SAS Braathens, in May. At the same time, the airline would create separate national airlines for Sweden and Denmark. SAS Braathens would operate 50 aircraft, all variations of the 737. The company took over the operating licence of Braathens, including the IATA and ICAO code, and callsign. Because all the operations streamlined and coordinated, there would be no further downstaffing due to the merger. From 1 June 2007, SAS Braathens was rebranded to Scandinavian Airlines, making it identical to the branding in Sweden and Denmark, although it remain a separate limited company named SAS Norge AS.

As of September 2009, Operation Crooked Code had resulted in charges against more than two dozen individuals, 13 of them city inspectors charged with bribery and bribery related crimes. The investigated is spearheaded by Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the United States Attorney in Chicago, with lead prosecutors Assistant U.S. Attorneys Juliet Sorensen, April Perry and Christopher Hotaling. As of September 2009, the investigation had netted 12 convictions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, City of Chicago Inspector General's Office, and United States Postal Inspection Service participated in the investigation of the Zoning and Building Departments Bribery Case. The evidence against the defendants includes recordings made by cooperating informants and a court-authorized wiretap on the developer Beny Garneata, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison in September 2009. Cooperating informants include a city inspector and an expediter, who acted as a \\"bagman\\" for developers to pay bribes in exchange for approval of building projects. In announcing the arrests of 15 individuals as part of the Crooked Code investigation in May 2008, U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald said, \\"The picture painted by the criminal charges filed today shows sadly that the permit process in Chicago is governed by a separate set of rules for those who pay to corrupt the system. These charges also show that last year's arrests did not change the system enough. It didn't stop the bribery. It just changed how the bribery was done; they got sneakier. Today's charges put on notice everyone who would think about paying, receiving, arranging or delivering a bribe that they will be caught and, when they are, will face jail.\\" The arrests and charges of the 15 defendants were announced by Patrick J.

The 15 defendants held positions including: property owners, developers, contractors, and seven city of Chicago inspectors.

In seven of these cases, defendants solicited help from a cooperating witness. Through this witness, a longtime businessperson who takes permit applications and other construction issues to the city on behalf of homeowners and developers, defendants were able to pay or receive bribes without physically presenting themselves. Former Chicago Inspector General David H. Hoffman said: \\"Taxpayers pay city inspectors to enforce the law. Instead, the city employees charged today used their position to help people violate the law. For thousands of dollars in bribes, they wrote false inspection reports and issued fraudulent certificates.

The regiment could trace its origins to 1759, when it was raised as the 4th Battalion Coast Sepoys. History One of the oldest regiments in the British Indian Army, the Palamcottah Light Infantry took part in the Carnatic Wars, the Battle of Sholinghur in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the Battle of Mahidpur in the Third Anglo-Mysore War, and the Battle of Ava in the Second Anglo-Burmese War. They were then sent to China as part of the British Empire forces that took part in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion, although without seeing active service. Recruitment basis After 1902 the basis of recruitment for most of the Madras regiments of the Indian Army shifted to the \\"martial races\\" of the Punjab and other northern regions. The Palamcottah Light Infantry however continued to be recruited in southern India. In 1914 four of its eight companies were Madrasi Muslims, two were Tamils and the remainder Parayans and Christian Madrasis. The regiment had about 13 British officers and 17 Indian officers. The India Army List dated October 1914 records the 63rd Light Infantry as sharing a regimental centre at Trichinopoly with the 61st Pioneers, the 64th Pioneers and the 83rd Light Infantry. Under the system of \\"linked battalions\\" in force at the time the 63rd shared recruits with any of the other regiments listed, according to individual unit needs. World War I During World War I the regiment initially remained in India on internal security duties as part of the 5th (Mhow) Division. In October 1914 the Palamcottah Light Infantry moved to British East Africa as part of the Indian Expeditionary Force B. It was part of the British landing force defeated by German colonial troops at the Battle of Tanga.J.A. Sibley, p26-p33 \\"Tanganyikan Guerrilla - East African Campaign 1914-18\\", At an early stage in the landing the regiment disintegrated when it came under heavy fire from the 6th Field Company of German askaris. Of 762 officers and men present at Tanga, the 63rd Light Infantry lost 85 killed, wounded and missing. It spent the remainder of the War on lines of communication service in East Africa before returning to India. Disbandment After World War I the Indian Army was restructured with the infantry moving from single battalion regiments to multi-battalion regiments.Sumner p.15 Following the allocation of individual battalions to the twenty new \\"large\\" regiments the nine remaining single battalion regiments were disbanded. These included the 63rd Palamcottah Light Infantry, which ceased to exist on 13 September 1922.John Gaylor, page 19 \\"Sons of John Company - the Indian & Pakistan Armies 1903-1991\\", Predecessor names *4th Battalion Coast Sepoys - 1759 *4th Carnatic Battalion - 1769 *3rd Carnatic Battalion - 1779 *3rd Madras Battalion - 1784 *1st Battalion, 3rd Madras Native Infantry - 1796 *3rd Madras Native Infantry (Palamcottah Light Infantry) - 1812 *3rd Madras Native Light Infantry - 1885 *63rd (Palamcottah) Madras Light Infantry - 1901 *63rd Palamcottah Light Infantry - 1903 Insignia and Uniform The Palamcottah Light Infantry had the usual bugle horn badge of light infantry regiments, in brass with the number 63 in the curl of the bugle and a crown above.

It is situated at the junction of Farm Roads 91, 432, and 2379 in northwestern Wilbarger County, approximately 15 miles northwest of Vernon. Wanderers Creek borders the community to the west. History The community was founded in 1908 as a railroad station on the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway. It was named after New York civil engineer J.T. Odell. Many of Odell's early residents came from Haulk, a nearby settlement. Upon the arrival of the railroad, a number of Haulk citizens were lured to a better location on land donated by T.H. Holloway. A post office was established on April 27, 1909. By 1919, thirty businesses were operating in Odell and the community thrived throughout the 1920s. In 1928, Odell was incorporated. The population was 424 at the 1930 census. Within a short time, however, the community began to decline. Several factors, including the Great Depression and a series of fires in the mid-1930s, accelerated the level of decline. The population fell to 301 in 1940, 238 in 1950, and 131 in 1960. Soon after, Odell reverted to the status of an unincorporated community. By the mid-1980s, a few stores and churches remained active in Odell. Cotton, cattle, grain, and oil formed the base of the local economy. Throughout the latter half of the twentieth century and into 2000, Odell was home to approximately 131 residents.

Trained as a nurse in Sydney, Corkhill enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 4 June 1915. After serving in France at the 1st and 3rd Australian General Hospitals, Corkhill was assigned to the 38th British Casualty Clearing Station near Abbeville on 21 August 1918. On 23 August, while the camp was being heavily bombed by enemy aircraft, Corkhill remained calm and continued to tend to her patients, despite the danger. For her bravery, she was awarded the Military Medal, one of only seven Australian nurses to be so decorated in the First World War. Following the Armistice, she went on to work as a nurse at various public hospitals, and donated a large collection of her father's photographs to the National Library of Australia. Early life alt=Childhood photo of the Corkhill sisters Corkill was born on 11 March 1887, the second child of William Henry Corkhill, a grazier and photographer, and Francis Hawtrey née Bate. Growing up on the family ranch, \\"Marengo\\", near Tilba Tilba in southern New South Wales, Corkhill, her sister Edith and brother Norman's lives were extensively recorded by their father, who by 1890 had become a professional photographer. She was first educated by a governess before attending the public school in town. She undertook nursing training at a private hospital in Summer Hill, Sydney and qualified as a general nurse in 1914. Military years On 4 June 1915, Corkhill enrolled as a staff nurse in the Australian Imperial Force. She left Fremantle aboard the A62 Wandila on 25 June 1915, and arrived in Egypt in July that year. She was assigned to the 1st Australian General Hospital, and assisted in the treatment of soldiers involved with the Gallipoli Campaign. On 24 March 1916, Corkhill was among a group of nurses sent to Marseille aboard the Braemar Castle, a hospital ship. Arriving in early April, she was then sent aboard a train destined for the 2nd British General Hospital in Le Havre. The train was poorly equipped and was missing many amenities, such as toilets or water, so the women were forced to improvise by washing with cologne. In her time at the British hospital, Corkhill looked forward to returning to an Australian hospital and being \\"amongst our boys\\"; the Australian soldiers often found their compatriots to be friendlier than the British nurses. On Anzac Day 1916, a year after the landing at Gallipoli, Corkhill and two other Australian nurses commemorated the occasion. They wore gum tree leaves on their capes, and gave small packets of cigarettes and matches to the Australians who were interned at the hospital as gifts. Corkhill went back to serve at the 1st Australian General Hospital in Rouen on 16 June 1916 for the remainder of the year. On 23 January 1917, she went to England on leave until 9 February. She then served at the Australian Hospital until July 1918, with the exception of her two leaves; to England in October 1917 and to Paris in February 1918. On 15 May 1918, Corkhill was sent to Abbeville to join the 3rd Australian General Hospital, and was briefly posted to the 38th British Casualty Clearing Station on 2 June. After serving in with the 3rd Australian General Hospital for a further two months, she was again posted to the Casualty Clearing Station on 21 August 1918. Military Medal Governor-General Lord Foster presenting Corkhill with the Military Medal.|alt=Pearl Corkhill is presented with the MM by the Governor-General Casualty Clearing Stations were deliberately sited as close to the front line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than the time to travel to a field hospital allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As a result of its proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients. For her actions, she was recommended for and later awarded the Military Medal. Corkhill was initially unconvinced that she deserved the award, being more concerned about having to purchase a new dress to wear while meeting the King. The award was more heavily celebrated by the men than by Corkhill herself, as she described in a letter to her mother: Later service alt=1st AAH Group Portrait The day following the action, 24 August, Corkhill was posted to the 1st Australian General Hospital, and went on leave in the United Kingdom. She was retained for service at the 1st Australian Auxiliary Hospital in Harefield, London on 27 August 1918. She was promoted to the rank of Sister on 1 October, and continued to serve at the hospital until She returned to Australia on 24 January 1919. She was discharged on 22 June 1919. Later life A alt=A Supper cloth made by Corkhill. A memorial commemorating Corkhill's efforts in the war was erected in Tilba, and she was presented with the medal by Governor-General Lord Foster. Following the war, Corkhill went on to pursue a nursing career. After serving as a nurse in various hospitals both in Australia and overseas, Corkhill became the senior sister at the District Hospital in Bega, New South Wales in 1951. In 1975, she donated a large collection of her father's photographs to the National Library of Australia. Amongst the one thousand piece collection were personal photographs along with pictures of the Tilba area, which were later used to create a book, Taken at Tilba, and an engagement calendar. Corkhill was a skilled horsewoman, and was the lead in the centenary Cooma Show. A supper cloth made by Corkhill while on duty has been used as an example of decorative crafts of the era, and a number of photographs she had taken while on duty were donated to the Australian War Memorial. Corkhill died on 4 December 1985 in Dalmeny, New South Wales. She was unmarried.

Due to the unmatched count of items, the number of people who answered \\"yes\\" to the awkward question can be mathematically deduced.  Example  The control group is asked how many of the following statements apply: *I have moved house in the past. *I own a pet. *I like to go to the theatre. *I have never been in a traffic accident. Let the total number of \\"yes\\"-answers from this group be 410. The second group additionally gets a question concerning the point of interest: *I have cheated on an examination. Let the total number of \\"yes\\"-answers from this group be 460.  Evaluation  The number of \\"yes\\"-answers in the control group is called the baseline. It is assumed that the second group would have given the same number, were it not for the critical question. Thus, their additional \\"yes\\"-answers (50 in the example) are due to the critical question. Their percentage is used to estimate the percentage of cheaters in the population. Let the number of participants in each group be 300. As expectation value, 50 of them answered \\"yes\\" to the critical question, meaning that approximately 17% of the population have cheated on examinations.

Nicknamed the \\"Southern Hero\\", he is a righteous knight-errant with incredible martial arts skills, often helping Prefect Bao Zheng uphold justice. Emperor Renzong of Song made him a 4th rank royal guard and gave him the title \\"Royal Cat\\" for his swift movements. Stories Saving Bao Zheng at the Gold Dragon Monastery Zhan Zhao sees a Taoist priest attempting to commit suicide and saves him. The priest reveals that two lecherous monks have killed the old monk in the Gold Dragon Monastery, and are using the place to hide women they kidnap. The priest reported them, but the government took in bribes and physically punished the priest instead. Meanwhile, Bao Zheng and servant Bao Xing arrive at the monastery for overnight lodging. At night, Zhan climbs over the wall and discovers that the monks have locked the pair up with plans to murder them for money. Zhan helps them escape while he stays behind. A few hours later, Bao Zheng sees a huge fire from the direction of the monastery. Saving Bao Zheng at Earth Dragon Crag While passing through Earth Dragon Crag, Zhan Zhao is confronted by a bandit named Zhao Hu and defeats him quickly. Other bandits come to help and Zhan sees that his old friend Wang Chao is the leader. Wang invites Zhan to the crag where he rules with blood brothers Ma Han, Zhang Long and Zhao. Zhan discovers that they have two prisoners and recognizes them as Bao Zheng and Bao Xing whom he had saved once before. He asks the bandits to release them and after talking, suggests to the four that instead of remaining as bandits, they should help Bao Zheng serve the country. Eventually his suggestion is followed. Unfoiling Bao Zheng's Assassination Plot Near Chenzhou, Zhan Zhao sees a woman crying and learns that Marquis Pang Yu had kidnapped a beautiful woman Jin Yuxian. At night, Zhan climbs over the wall to Pang Yu's palace and discovers a plot by Pang and Governor Jiang Wan to assassinate Bao Zheng, on his way to Chenzhou to investigate Pang's wrongdoings. Zhan follows the assassin Xiang Fu and notifies Bao beforehand. At night, Xiang is spotted on the roof by Bao's vigilant entourage and when he tries to escape, Zhan shoots him down with an arrow. Using Zhan's tips, Bao also saves Jin and arrests Pang. Engagement to Ding Yuehua Zhan Zhao is invited by Ding Zhaohui to visit the Ding Family Village. There he tries sword dancing with a famous sword from the village, Zhanlu, and remarks that Zhanlu is much lighter than his own sword, Juque. Outraged, the younger cousin Ding Yuehua challenges Zhan to a duel as she is Zhanlu's owner. Zhan is very impressed with Ding Yuehua's skills and admits defeat when she cuts off his bandanna. However, Ding Zhaolan notices that Zhan has actually cut off Ding Yuehua's earring which is much more difficult. With the blessings of the entire Ding family, Zhan and Ding Yuehua exchange swords as engagement gifts. Dueling with Bai Yutang Zhan Zhao learns that Bai Yutang is in the capital looking to challenge him, as a result of him getting the nickname \\"Royal Cat\\" from Emperor Renzong. While Zhan talks about it in the Kaifeng court, Zhao Hu makes a comment that Bai is not to be feared. As soon as Zhao finishes the sentence, someone listening to the conversation outside throws something that breaks the wine cup Zhao has in hand. Zhan quickly goes outside and engages in a battle with this man in the night. Zhan is impressed with Bai's agility and feels his anger. He also gets serious and breaks Bai's sabre. Zhan pursues Bai, but Bai throws a stone, knocking off Zhan's bandanna and manages to escape. Being Captured by Bai Yutang Bai Yutang steals three treasures and leaves a note specifically challenging Zhan Zhao to follow him to Hollow Island. Jiang Ping and Gongsun Ce suggest that Zhan wait until Han Zhang is found. However, Zhan gets impatient and goes to Hollow Island by himself. The guards at Hollow Island would not open the gate and provoke him. Angry, Zhan climbs the wall at night and finds Bai's place well-lit. He goes inside, and after passing through a few rooms, steps on a spring-lock and falls in a trap. On the third day of his imprisonment he is saved by Ding Zhaohui and gets the three treasures back. Career He was the royal guard of the palace. He was assigned to work together with Bao Zheng who was a governor of Kaifeng city, the capital city of Northern Song. He was a very honest person who was good at martial arts. In his life he was known for serving Bao Zheng even more than being a royal guard of the imperial court. Zhan Zhao was best known for his martial art skills. He was the body guard of Bao Zheng and the third ranking royal guard of the Song's Royal Palace. His title was \\"The Royal Cat\\" (御猫, yùmāo). He was the only man who was allowed to enter the Inner Palace armed. People said that he represented the Wu (martial) aspect while Bao Zheng represented the Wen (civil) aspect. He was also the leader of Bao Zheng's' guards, namely Wang Chao, Ma Han, Zhang Long and Zhao Hu. Before Zhan Zhao became a royal guard, he was just a man traveling around the land. He was trained with high power martial art. There was one time that he fought against \\"The Five Rats\\" who each had a special power, specializing in water and others underground. Zhan Zhao was once ordered to catch Bai Yutang who was one of the \\"Five Rats\\". He invaded their island in order to fight against the five rats. He was able to defeat all of them. Of the Five Rats, Bai Yutang was the best among them and the youngest brother of Five Rats. Media Adaptations Justice Bao (1993 TV Series) One of the most well-known media adaptations of Zhan Zhao is the 1993, 236-episode Justice Bao television series. Zhan Zhao, played by Hong Kong actor Kenny Ho, is portrayed as a righteous, yet gentle and kind knight-errant who assists Bao Zheng, often taking on roles such as Bao's personal body guard, policeman, and detective. Zhan Zhao's signature garments of the red robe is especially memorable for many, and is often repeated by other television adaptations following this one. It is also because of the red robe appearance that fans describe Kenny Ho's version of Zhan Zhao using these lines: 青锋昭律义 红袍展仁心, \\"the sword that serves justice, the red robe that displays a kind heart,\\" thus incorporating Zhan Zhao's name (), his personalities, and appearance. Justice Pao (1995 TV Series) Following the popular 1993 TV series is this 80-episode series produced by Television Broadcast Limited. Zhan Zhao, played by Hong Kong actor Felix Wong, once again wears his signature red robe. This version of Zhan Zhao is similarly portrayed as the righteous and sympathetic paladin who aids Bao Zheng in his criminal cases.  Three Heroes and Five Gallants (2016 TV Series)  A new adaptation of Shi Yukun's The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants produced by Huayi Brothers and Tianxing Yiyuan Entertainment (), with actor Yan Yikuan playing Zhan Zhao / Shen Zhongyuan. Zhan Zhao is again portrayed as a righteous and clever hero who takes on the persona of Shen Zhongyuan in order to spy on enemies of the people and to complete missions assigned to him by Bao Zheng. It also allows him to team together with the Five Rats. References *Bao Qingtian. Zhan Zhao VS Five Rats. Jin Chaoqun, Kenny Ho. CTS, 1994.

Life Born at Conwy in North Wales, he was the second son of John Robinson, by his wife Ellin, daughter of William Brickdale. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1545 as a sizar, proceeded B.A. in 1548, and was a fellow from 1548 to 1563. In 1551 he commenced M.A., was bursar of his own college in 1551–3, and a proctor in the university for 1552, dean of his college 1577–8, and vice-president of his college in 1561. Plays written by him were acted at Queens' College in 1550, 1552, and 1553, the last being a comedy entitled Strylius. In 1555 he subscribed the Roman Catholic articles. He was ordained at Bangor by William Glynn, first as acolyte and sub-dean on 12 March 1557, then deacon on the 13th, and priest on the 14th, under a special faculty from Cardinal Pole. On 20 December 1559 Matthew Parker licensed him to preach throughout his province, and he was then, or about that time, appointed one of his chaplains. He proceeded at Cambridge B.D. in 1560 and D.D. in 1566. A sermon preached by him at St. Paul's Cross in December 1561 was commended by Edmund Grindal. After this preferment came quickly. He was appointed on 13 December 1561 to the rectory of Shepperton in Middlesex; on 16 June 1562 to the archdeaconry of Merioneth; and on 26 August of the same year to the sinecure rectory of Northop in Flintshire. He also became rector of Witney in Oxfordshire. By right of his archdeaconry he sat in the convocation of 1563, when he subscribed the Thirty-nine Articles, and voted against the defeated proposal which was made for modification in rites and ceremonies. In 1564 he also subscribed the bishops' propositions concerning ecclesiastical dress, and wrote Tractatus de vestium usu in sacris. He was at Cambridge during Queen Elizabeth's visit in August 1564, and prepared an account of it in Latin; a similar account was written by him of the queen's visit to Oxford in 1566. He was one of the Lent preachers before the queen in 1565. Robinson was elected bishop of Bangor, in succession to Rowland Meyrick, after much deliberation on the part of the archbishop, under a licence attested at Cambridge on 30 July 1566. He also held in commendam the archdeaconry of Merioneth, and the rectories of Witney, Northop, and Shepperton. The archdeaconry he resigned in 1573 in favour of his kinsman, Humphrey Robinson, but he took instead the archdeaconry of Anglesey, which he held until his death. He resigned Shepperton about November 1574. For the next few years Robinson acted against the non-Protestant customs in his diocese. On 7 October 1567 he wrote to Sir William Cecil, noticing the use of images, altars, pilgrimages, and vigils. On 23 April 1571 he was acting as one of the commissioners for ecclesiastical causes at Lambeth, and in the convocation held that year he subscribed the English translation of the Thirty-nine Articles and the book of Canons. About 1581 he was still suspected of Catholic tendencies; on 28 May 1582 he wrote two letters, one to Francis Walsingham and the other to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, justifying himself. He died on 13 February 1585, and was buried on the 17th in Bangor Cathedral on the south side of the high altar. His effigy and arms were delineated in brass, but the figure had been removed at the time of Browne Willis's survey in 1720. Works Robinson made a collection on Welsh history, which was formerly preserved in the Hengwrt Library. He sent to Archbishop Parker a copy of part of Eadmer's history. He translated into Latin a life of Gruffydd ab Cynan from an old Welsh text at Gwydyr; the text and translation were edited by the Rev. Robert Williams for the Archaeologia Cambrensis for 1866. William Morgan, in the dedication of his Welsh version of the bible (published in 1588), acknowledges assistance from a bishop of Bangor, presumed to be Robinson. Family Robinson married Jane, daughter of Randal Brereton, by Mary, daughter of Sir William Griffith of Penrhyn, chamberlain of North Wales, and by her he had numerous sons, including Hugh, and William, his eldest, whose son was John Robinson (1617–1681) the royalist.

An OBDuino may be assembled and customised by an electronics hobbyist; it displays information such as instantaneous fuel economy (e.g. miles per gallon, L/100 km or kilometres per litre), engine tuning parameters etc. on an LCD. OBDuino utilises the On-Board Diagnostics interface found in most modern cars. Features * Most OBD-II PIDs or derived values may be displayed. Common values include ** Fuel: cost, used or remaining, wasted while idling, consumption, measured in mpg or l/100 km ** Engine: load, RPM ** Temperatures: coolant, air intake ** Vehicle speed ** Tank distance ** Remaining distance that can be travelled on the current tank of fuel ** Throttle position ** Battery voltage ** CAN status, for CAN protocol only, display TX and RX error * Displays instantaneous values, average, maximum and minimum values calculated per trip, per outing, or per tank of fuel * Menu system for configuring parameters * Relatively cheap compared to commercial alternatives * Customisable and extendable OBDuino does not display or reset engine fault codes (which are available over the OBD interface). Design The key components of the design are: * A microcontroller. One of the various AVR- based Arduino kits is typically used for this, although one of several Atmel AVR microcontrollers may be used directly in a custom OBDuino circuit. * An interface to the car's management system, using the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) connector found in most modern cars. This requires a cable and a circuit. There are several variations of this circuit depending on the particular OBD protocol implemented: *# ISO 9141/ISO 9141-2/ISO 14230, using Freescale MCZ33290EF *# CAN, using MCP2515 and MCP2551 *# Generic (SAE J1850 PWM & VPW/ISO 9141/ISO 9141-2/ISO 14230/CAN protocols), using an ELM327 from ELM Electronics. Although this gives a more versatile trip computer compatible with most modern vehicles, the ELM327 chip adds significant cost to the circuit and requires a significant supporting circuit for different protocols. It removes the complexity of interpreting the various OBD protocols. *#STN1110 which is software compatible with the ELM327. Unfortunately, this IC is not pin-compatible with the ELM327, therefore the circuit would require some changes. * An LCD and three input buttons. A typical LCD is 2 rows x 16 characters or 4x20 character, based on the HD44780, with a circuit based on the mpguino circuit. * Microcontroller code. This is a C++ program based on the Arduino framework, called a Sketch in Arduino terminology. This is loaded on the microcontroller over a USB or serial interface using the free Arduino integrated development environment. Many Arduino-based projects have either custom printed circuit boards available which include the AVR microcontroller (removing the need for an Arduino board), or extension boards that contain the extra circuit and that plug directly into the standard Arduino circuit board. No such PCBs are available for the OBDuino as of September 2009. Project The OBDuino project was started in 2008 based on the MPGuino project, with the desire to simplify wiring to the vehicle, instead of using the standard OBD-II socket that does not directly wire to the vehicle's fuel injection system and digital vehicle speed sensor, and to access the wide range of engine management data available using OBD. The project is centred on the discussion forum on ecomodder.com and the wiki and code hosting provided by Google code, project is released under the GPL license. The main OBDuino thread on the eccomoder forum was started by jmonroe on 1 June 2008 as a fork of MPGuino discussions. Magister posted an OBDuino announcement to the Arduino forum on 4 December 2008. As of September 2009, the OBDuino32K code credits these developers: > Main coding/ISO/ELM: Frédéric (aka Magister on ecomodder.com) > LCD part: Dave (aka dcb on ecomodder.com), optimized by Frédéric > ISO Communication Protocol: Russ, Antony, Mike > Features: Mike, Antony > Bugs & Fixes: Antony, Frédéric, Mike > The 32K in the obduino32K name differentiates the code targeted at the Atmega328 with 32k flash memory (i.e. Arduino 2009) version from the Atmega168 16k (Arduino 2008) version. Variations * An OBDuino variant is described in the book Practical Arduino (2009) by Jonathan Oxer and Hugh Blemings. Based on the Arduino Mega, the OBDuino is extended to log GPS and OBD data to a USB stick. * A Graphical OBD MPGuino graphs values such as miles per gallon and OBD-II PIDs, etc., on a 128*64 pixel LCD. * OBDuino author Magister is working on a commercial prototype with a CAN-only protocol. Related alternatives * Scangauge is a commercial trip computer using the OBD interface. In addition to the trip-computer-style features in OBDuino, the Scangauge also includes features for displaying and resetting engine fault codes. * The mpguino is another Arduino-based trip computer, and is mainly limited to fuel usage measurement. It may be used in any vehicle which has an electric fuel injection system and digital vehicle speed sensor. The mpguino links directly to these sensors so it doesn't require an OBD2 interface. It can report instant and tank MPG, remaining miles till the tank is empty etc. The mpguino is available in kit form from several suppliers. * The SuperMID (English tr.) is an enthusiast/hobbyist trip computer, designed originally for the Toyota Prius, although it may be used in any vehicle which has an electric fuel injection system and digital vehicle speed sensor. The SuperMID interfaces directly to the engine ECU or sensors, rather than using a standard OBDII connector. * Bruce D. Lightner's entry won a 2004 Circuit Cellar design contest. Lightner's design uses an AVR microcontroller connected to an OBD-II interface to drive an analogue gauge displaying fuel consumption in mpg. This only implements the SAE J1850 VPW variant of the OBD-II protocol suite (so it only works with mostly GM cars that use VPW). * An OBD II Car Computer design\\"OBDii for KPW protocol\\". Nerdkits.com is described by NerdKits using their AVR-based microcontroller kit. This implements the SAE J1850 VPW variant of the OBD-II protocol suite (so it only works with certain cars that use VPW) and displays RPMs, Coolant Temperature, Vehicle Speed and Percent Throttle on an LCD. This is partly derived from Bruce D. Lightner's design. * OBD2-LCD is an AVR based OBD-II trip computer, designed by Florian Schäffer. It implements the ISO 9141 and ISO 14230 (KW 2000) OBD-II variants, with design and code published and available in kit form. The new kit supports CAN (ISO 15765) too.

She was the first Swedish woman in these fields. Edberg was a pioneer in making the art of swimming and ice skating accepted for women in Sweden Idun (1890): Nr 15 (121)  Biography  Nancy Edberg was taught to swim by her father. At this point, there was little physical education for females, one of few female role models being Gustafva Lindskog, the first instructor in physical education in 1818. Nancy Edberg was employed as a swimming instructor at the newly founded bath house for women in Stockholm in 1847. This was the first bath house open to women in the nation: first located at Riddarhuset, it was moved to Kastellholmen the following year. In 1851, she was made swimming master at Åbomska simskolan (Åbom Swimming School), and from 1853, she held her own swimming lessons at Djurgården. She was given the license to open her own bath house by King Oscar I of Sweden in 1856, and in 1856-1858, she held public swimming exhibitions at Gjörckes simskola (Gjörcke Swimming School) with her students to finance the opening of her own bath house, likely the first public swimming exhibitions by women in Sweden and, possibly, also Europe. She inaugurated her own bath house in July 1859, and served as its swimming master until 1866. Louise of the Netherlands, then Queen of Sweden, and her daughter Louise (later Queen of Denmark) were among Edberg's students between 1862 and 1864. The art of swimming was initially not regarded as being entirely proper for women, but when the Queen and her daughter supported it by attending the lessons, swimming was quickly made fashionable and became accepted for women. The same thing happened when Nancy Edberg introduced lessons in teaching women to ice skate (1864); this was initially considered so improper that a covered fence was put up around the place where the lessons took place to hide the women from public view; but when the queen and her daughter themselves joined the class, ice skating quickly became fashionable and accepted for women, and the fence was pulled down. Among her other students in swimming was the Princess of Wales, Alexandra of Denmark, and the Empress of Russia, Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark). At the swimming exhibition at Gjörckes simskola in Stockholm on 24 August 1864 \\"Mamsell Nancy Edberg displayed her skill in the art of swimming\\".Berg, P. G. & Stålberg, Wilhelmina (red.), Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor, P. G. Berg, Stockholm, 1864-1866 In 1865, she introduced swimming for women in Oslo in Norway, and then travelled to Saint Petersburg in Russia on a scholarship and recommendation from the royal couple to the Russian Emperor and Empress. Edberg introduced swimming for women in Copenhagen, Trondhjem and a multitude of Swedish cities \\"from Ystad to Östersund\\". She married the Danish lithographer Carl Andrésen (d. 1873) in 1867. Nancy Edberg was given a front page biography as a tribute for her pioneer work at the feminist publication Idun in 1890.

The title was a pun on seraph (an angelic being) and sheriff, reflecting the Western shows that were popular on TV at the time. Background By 1959, the Marx Brothers were still popular but, in their sixties and seventies, were considered too old to make films or a regular television series. They hadn't appeared together in a decade, since their final film Love Happy in 1949. On March 8, 1959, Chico and Harpo starred together in an episode of General Electric Theater called \\"The Incredible Jewel Robbery\\". The brothers played Harry and Nick, two inept robbers who try to pull a jewelry heist wearing Groucho Marx disguises. When they are caught and placed in a police lineup, the real Groucho shows up and is immediately fingered as the thief. Groucho delivers the only line in the otherwise silent program: \\"We won't talk until we see our lawyer!\\" Pilot Encouraged by the audience reaction, in April the brothers began filming a pilot for Deputy Seraph, a proposed weekly TV series in which Chico and Harpo were angels whose job was to possess people for brief periods of time: bringing two lovers together, exposing a criminal, and so forth. Groucho was cast as a \\"Deputy Seraph\\" who would appear in approximately every third show to help undo some of the pandemonium created by his brothers. He would contact \\"the man upstairs\\" via telephone: saying, \\"Phone, please!,\\" would cause a telephone handset to magically appear in his hand. (\\"I must find out how they do that,\\" Groucho marveled). Phillip Rapp, a lifelong Marx Brothers fan, came up with the concept and served as the show's producer. The pilot story involved a triangle between a young composer, the niece of a compulsive gambler/concert pianist and a sleazy casino owner. A psychiatrist attributes the pianist's strange habit of shooting the piano keys and speaking in an impossible Italian accent to various childhood traumas (these predilections, of course, were Chico trademarks). In the end, the girl and boy get together and the villain gets his comeuppance. Since the Marxes only had to film a fraction of each episode (with other actors/characters impersonating them for most of each show), the concept seemed ideal. The brothers were filmed in Hollywood, while the other scenes would have been shot at Pinewood Studios in England. The pilot was never completed. When doctors discovered that Chico was suffering from arteriosclerosis (which would kill him two years later) and thus could not be insured, the producers had to cancel the project.Marxology website Availability All that remains of the pilot episode of Deputy Seraph is about fifteen minutes of raw, unedited footage, available at the Marx Brothers website.Marxology website References External links *Filmfax magazine article *Deputy Seraph on YouTube Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series Category:Marx Brothers (film series) ","title":"Deputy Seraph"},{"id":"24479748","text":"Ophiusa hopei is a moth of the family Erebidae.

Ó Laoí was a descendant of a hereditary medical family to the O'Flahertys, who were first mentioned in Crichaireacht cinedach nduchasa Muintiri Murchada, c. 1000. They moved west across Lough Corrib with the O'Flahertys, continuing their profession into the 17th century. Ó Laoí lived in Letterdeskert, just west of Carna, County Galway. Hy-Brazil Hy-Brazil is a mythical island said to be found off the west coast of Galway. In an account written in 1684, Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh states: > There is now living, Morogh O'Ley, who immagines he was himself personally > in O'Brazil for two days and saw out of it the iles of Aran, Golamhead, > Irrosbeghill and other places of the west continent he was acquainted with. > The manner of it he relates, that being in Irrosainhagh, in the month of > April, Anno Domini 1668, going alone from one village to another, in a > melancholy humour, upon some discontent of his wife, he was encountered by > two or three strangers, and forcibly carried out by boat into O'Brazil, as > such as were within it told him, and they could speak both English and > Irish. He was ferried out hoodwink'd, in a boat, as he immagins, till he was > left on the sea point by Galway; where he lay in a friend's house for some > dayes after, being very desperately ill, and knowes not how he came to > Galway then.

In a version given to John O'Donovan in 1839, Ó Laoí was a member of a ship's crew who landed on the island, and were warned off by a man who told them it was enchanted. As they were leaving, the man gave Ó Laoí a book, telling him not to open it for seven years. Ó Laoí obeyed the instructions, and was able to practise surgery and medicine. O'Donovan was told that Ó Laoí descendants had recently sold the book in Dublin. The Book of Hy-Brazil However fanciful its given origins, the Book of Hy-Brazil exists. It was written, in Irish and Latin, in the 15th-century giving lists of diseases, their symptoms and cures under various columns. In his notes to Iar-Connacht, James Hardiman supposes that with the loss of the family lands during the Cromwellian era, Murrough invented the Hy-Brazil adventure to establish and set himself up in business, using the old family book.

The origins of the poem lie in Southey's wanting to write a poem describing Spain and the story of Rodrigo. Originally entitled \\"Pelayo, the Restorer of Spain,\\" the poem was later retitled to reflect the change of emphasis within the story. It was completed after Southey witnessed Napoleon's actions in Europe, and Southey included his reactions against invading armies into the poem. The poem was successful, and multiple editions followed immediately after the first edition. The story describes fighting over the inheritance of the Spanish throne and how Roderick manages to take over. After Roderick rapes Florinda, daughter of his important ally Count Julian, Julian and others change their allegiance and aid the invading Moorish army. During a battle against the Moors, Roderick is wounded and escapes to start a new life. Eventually, Roderick travels across Spain before determining that he must return to rescue Pelayo, an heir to the Spanish throne who was held prisoner by the Moors. After freeing Pelayo, he meets Florinda who reveals that her rape was not Roderick's fault. The group allies itself with Count Pedro, and they build an army to wage war against the Moors. While fighting, Count Julian is assassinated by his own allies, and the Moorish army is broken and defeated. The poem ends with Roderick returning to the wilderness. Roderick ,the last King of Visigoths in Spain. Southey, like other poets who described the story of Roderick at the time, connected the Moorish invasion of Spain with Napoleon's invading of other countries. The story is also used to discuss the relationship of Islam and Christianity while promoting Southey's own views on religion. Regarding the rape scene, it is possible that Southey removed Roderick's guilt to create a more sympathetic character. Critics gave the work mixed reviews but many believed that Roderick the Last of the Goths was Southey's greatest work. Some critics pointed out various flaws in the work, but most felt that the subject was well handled and appropriately chosen. Background The idea for Southey to write a poem about historical Spain, which would later become Roderick, originated in his writing a monodrama on Cava and her being raped by Rodrigo. In 1805, he decided to use the subject for his final epic.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 131–132 In 1808, Southey resumed working on his poem Curse of Kehama after he almost gave up poetry because of the reception of Thalaba the Destroyer and Madoc. This return to writing was promoted by the poet Walter Savage Landor who encouraged Southey to complete the epic along with writing the work \\"Pelayo, the Restorer of Spain\\". This poem would later be retitled Roderick the Last of the Goths. By 1812, Southey was working on various works, including the collection Omniana, and he continued to add sections to Roderick.Spech 2006 pp. 126, 150 After 1810, Southey began to change from Jacobin political feelings to support of the establishment and monarchies.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 132 While writing the epic, his feelings were shaped by the events of Napoleon's conquests in Europe and his invasion of Spain. Napoleon's actions provoked Southey to disapprove of one nation controlling another nation. These changing beliefs helped to shape Roderick, which involved the Moorish invasion of Spain. The poem was completed 14 July 1814. During this time, Southey was made a member of the Royal Spanish Academy. It was put into print in August and published in November. It was the last long poem that Southey would write.Spech 2006 p. 159, 161 When Southey was told that Francis Jeffrey was going to write a bad review of the poem, he claimed, \\"Jeffrey can no more stand in my way to fame than Tom Thumb could stand in my way in the street. I consider him a public nuisance and shall deal with him accordingly.\\"Speech 2006 qtd. p. 162 The poem had a second and third edition published in 1815. A fourth edition was published in 1816. The printed poem also included a series of notes, a common feature to his long poems, which drew complaints from reviewers.Madden 1972 pp. 175, 188 Poem Southey's story of Roderick originally described Pelayo as the hero of the story and his enemy, Roderick, last Visigoth king, as the villain. However, Roderick was portrayed a more sympathetic life as the story changed focus from the focus on Spain to the focus on the tragedy of Roderick. The Visigoths, original rulers of Spain, fall under the invading Moors, which was provoked by the rape of Florinda by Roderick. However, the fall of the Visigoths was also due to internal strife and political disorder. In particular, there was disorder with the ascension of Roderick to the Spanish throne, as Roderick attained it after his father, Theodofred, was blinded by his uncle Witiza. During this time, Pelayo, cousin to Roderick and whose father was killed by Witiza at the prompting of his traitorous mother Favila, fled for his life from Spain. When Roderick takes over, he defends Witiza and spares his other relatives, but the survivors along with Count Julian also aid the Moors in invading Spain.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 132–133 In the sub plot, Roderick's rape of Florinda leads to Count Julian, her father, turning against Roderick and aiding the Moors. However, Florinda feels that she possibly misled Roderick and caused the incident. She confesses these feelings to Roderick who at that time was using the disguise of Father Maccabee. In her confession, she admits that they kissed and promised to meet again because she was passionately in love with him. However, she decided that her actions were wrong because he was married and she determined that she would become a nun. When she met with Roderick later, he tells her that he wants to leave his wife. In turn, she reveals that she wanted to become a nun, which leads to a fight and, without any description or explanation, she was taken.Spech 2006 pp. 159–161 The poem's story begins shortly after the Moors invade. The Visigoths are conquered at Guadalete in 711 AD, and Roderick escapes from the battle to start a new life as a hermit. He is plagued with remorse and he feels that all he has brought is suffering. He constantly dreams of Christ bleeding and sees images of Florinda's rape. Eventually, Romano, a monk, is able to comfort Roderick as they travel to a coast hermitage. However, Romano dies and Roderick is left with only his despair as a companion. This life is interrupted by a dream of Rusilla, Roderick's mother, chained and imprisoned until Pelayo saves her. He interprets the dream as a command from God to help his country. Roderick, changed and aged, travels through his country to the unconquered land of Cantabria. After he enters into a ruined city, he meets Adosinda, a woman burying her family. She, the only survivor, tells how the Moors had killed everyone and left her alive to be a concubine. She escaped by killing her captor in his sleep and returned to the city to mourn over the dead. Roderick is given a new name, Maccabee, and is sent by Adosinda to avenge the people killed by the Moors.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 133–134 Roderick travels to a monastery and learns of the fall of the Visigoths. The only one who has not abandoned the country is Pelayo, but he was a captive at Cordoba. At the monastery, Roderick is ordained before he sets off to free Pelayo. While travelling, he hears stories about himself and people debating over the cause was of the Moorish invasion. Roderick overhears one old man defend him, who turns out to be his tutor Siverian. Siverian, also seeking to free Pelayo, joins with Roderick and they go to Cordoba. They stop by Roderick's old home before going to the tomb of Theodofred. While there, an individual challenges them to fight, and it is revealed that it is Pelayo, who was allowed leave to pray. Roderick and Pelayo discuss how to save their country before Roderick accepts Pelayo as his king. Pelayo returns to his imprisonment while planning his escape, where he is joined by Alphonso, the son of Count Pedro who wishes to marry Pelayo's daughter, and by Florinda, who is hiding to avoid marriage. Together, they escape the city and meet up with Roderick and Siverian.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 134–135 While in the desert, Florinda confesses the events of her rape to Roderick and reveals that she truly loved Roderick whereas his wife, Egilona, was now married to Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, a Moorish leader. She also admits that she felt guilty for the seduction. Roderick accepts that his sin was from tragic circumstances and not from his own fault. After the confession, they travel to the land of Count Pedro, father of Alphonso. While there, they discover an army of men wanting to be led off to war. When Pedro sees that the hostages, Pelayo and Alphonso, are free, he decides to go to battle. To settle any past family problems, Pelayo's daughter and Pedro's son marry, and Alphonso is made the heir of the Kingdom of León and promises to keep fighting until the Moors are defeated. However, Moors come and attack at the same time but are stopped by the warriors. A captured Moor tells Pelayo that another invasion force was sent to Pelayo's old castle and the army sets out.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 135–137 When they arrive at the castle, there is no one to be found. It turns out that Pelayo's family was led by his wife, Gaudiosa, into hiding. When the Moors came, Adosinda was able to defeat the raiding party and free any captives. After blowing a horn as a signal to his people, Pelayo is reunited with his people. Roderick is reunited with his mother but quickly leaves before he talks to her. When Siverian goes to find out what was wrong, he realises that Roderick is overcome with emotion and figures out that Roderick was his old student. The plot transitions to the Moors army as they are busy attacking any rebels. The army is supported by the Spanish traitors. Orpas, a Moorish leader who wanted Florinda as his wife and Julian's lands as his own, begins to work against Julian and turns the Moors against him. After Orpas accuses Julian of inability to convert his own daughter to Islam, Florinda returns to her father with Roderick at her side. After fighting over religion, Roderick tells Julian that Julian is responsible for Spain's misery. Julian attacks Roderick for raping his daughter, but Florinda intervenes and defends Roderick.Bernhardt- Kabisch 1977 pp. 137–139 The rest of the story describes the reconquest of Spain and the defeat of the Moors by internal fighting. The Moor Abd al-Aziz is assassinated. This causes further suspicions to be laid against Julian, and his rivals decide to assassinate him. Guisla, Pelayo's sister, pretends to join the Moors and convinces them to attack the city of Covadonga. The Spanish army sets a trap in a valley and surrounds the Moors. A quick battle follows, and the Spaniards are able to avenge themselves upon the Moors. At the same time, Julian is assassinated. As he dies, Julian, knowing he was betrayed, tells his loyal troops to join up with the Spaniards. Before he finally passes, he is brought to a chapel dedicated to St. Peter and is received back into the Christian faith. The poem ends with Julian's men joining Pedro's forces as Orpas is killed by Roderick. Taking up a horse, Roderick leads Pelayo's and Pedro's troops against the Moors and everyone realises Roderick's true identity as the previous king. As they begin to fight against the Moors, the Spanish change \\"Roderick the Goth\\" and \\"Roderick and Vengeance\\" as they began to kill all of the Moors in sight. After the battle, Roderick disappears once again into hermitage.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 141–133 Themes Like Walter Scott and Landor, Southey connects the events surrounding Napoleon with the Moors' invasion of Spain within his work.Spech 2006 p. 159 In a letter to Landor, Southey described the rape scene: \\"here you have a part of the poem so difficult to get over even tolerably that I verily believe if I had at first thought of making Roderick any thing more than a sincere penitent this difficulty would have deterred me from attempting the subject.\\"Spech 2006 qtd. p. 161 To overcome the problem with having his main character rape a woman, Southey decided to put some of the responsibility on Florinda and make Roderick more sympathetic.Spech 2006 p. 161 It is also possible that there are autobiographical elements to the scene, especially with Roderick's problematic marriage to a woman he did not love as possibly describing the events of his friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge's life and his love for Sara Hutchinson. This would allow Southey to deal with events from his life in a poetic form.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 136–137 In terms of religion, Southey depicts a debate between Islam and Christianity. Although Julian defends his faith and attacks Roderick as a sinner, Roderick says that Christianity is a religion of forgiveness and that Julian has turned from God. Although Roderick is a Catholic, his arguments are actually a combination of Deistic theology, Stoic philosophy, and generic Christian ethics that reflect many of Southey's views.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 139–140 Critical response Southey's contemporary James Losh believed that the poem was \\"superior to anything before written by Southey\\".Spech 2006 qtd. p. 159 A letter from Charles Lamb to Southey dated 6 May 1815 said, \\"I have, since the receipt of your present, read it quite through again, and with no diminished pleasure. I don't know whether I ought to say that it has given me more pleasure than any of your long poems. Kehama is doubtless more powerful, but I don't feel that firm footing in it that I do in Roderick\\".Madden 1972 qtd. p. 186 An anonymous review in the December 1814 Theatrical Inquisitor argued, \\"It is scarcely possible to view the errors of exalted genius without breathing a sigh of compassion and regret. The generous mind feels humiliated at the contemplation [...] Such are the feelings that must be excited by the reader of Southey's poems [...] The story of the present poem is interesting, and would probably have made an excellent romance. It has, however, several capital defects, that make it altogether unfit for an heroic poem\\".Madden 1972 qtd. pp. 175–176 This was followed by a March 1815 review by John Herman Merivale in the Monthly Review, which claimed, \\"We have no scruple in declaring our opinion that this production will contribute to the advancement of the author's legitimate fame more largely than any of his former poems. Its principal faults are that it is too long by half, too declamatory, and consequently often cold and spiritless where it ought to be most impassioned, and that it is incumbered by a pervading affection of scriptural phraseology\\".Madden 1972 qtd. p. 176 Not everything was a problem: \\"these defects are counterbalanced by a well chosen subject, happily suited to the prevailing enthusiasm of the author's mind in favour of Spanish liberty, by a deep tone of moral and religious feeling, by an exalted spirit of patriotism, by fine touches of character, by animated descriptions of natural scenery [...] and by an occasional excellence of versification worthy of the best and purest age of English poetry. We are sorry to be obliged to qualify this praise by repeating that it applies to the work before us only in part\\".Madden 1972 qtd. pp. 176–177 Grosvenor Bedford, in an April 1815 Quarterly Review article, stated, \\"The critic who undertakes to give an epitome of a poem of so high a rank as Roderick, has little to do but to point out in the mass of admirable matter those things which strike him as most worthy of admiration. Original in its plan, true in its fundamental elements, and consistent in its parts, it rouses the feelings, and stimulates those powers of the imagination, which rejoice in the consciousness of exertion.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. p. 179 The review concluded, \\"Of the versification which Mr. Southey has employed we have given our readers sufficient specimens to enable them to judge for themselves. The variety of its cadences gives a spirit which relieves its grandeur, and the redundant syllable at the end of many of the lines prevents the majesty of its tone from oppressing the ear. The language is such as the best authors of the best era of our literature would acknowledge, nor can we give it higher praise than to say that its standard worth would be admitted in the mint of Queen Elizabeth's age.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. p. 182 Also in April 1815 was John Taylor Coleridge's review for the British Critic, which read, \\"This is the first time that we have had an opportunity of paying Mr. Southey the attention which he deserves; and we avail ourselves of it gladly [...] Mr. Southey is eminently a moral writer; to the high purpose implied in this title, the melody of his numbers, the clear rapidity of his style, the pathetic power which he exercises over our feelings, and the interesting manner of telling his story, whether in verse or prose, are all merely contributive.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. pp. 183–184 The review concluded: \\"here is plenty of sword and dagger, war-horse and chariot, a bugle or two, some little love, several beauties, and even a marriage in prospectu, with all the other ingredients of a 'charming poem.' If any one doat so desperately on 'love and glory,' that this does not content him, we are very sorry, but we cannot honestly recommend Don Roderick to his attention.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. pp. 185–186 An anonymous review in the September 1815 Christian Observer stated, \\"To the poem of Roderick, Mr. Southey has annexed a voluminous collection of notes. The taste of our elder authors in this respect is now entirely obsolete. Our Shakespeares and Miltons never thought it necessary to ballast their poetry with a mass of prose, and perhaps felt secure that, if they found the text, posterity would not fail to find the commentary.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. p. 188 The review concluded, \\"Those productions, in the mean time, have a far more than compensating merit. On the present occasion, if the commentator of Roderick appears scarcely worthy of the poet, yet he must be a very fastidious, or a very dull reader, who does not find the evil of possessing the commentary, infinitely overpaid by the gratification of reading the poem.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. p. 189 Another anonymous review, in the November 1815 British Review, declared, \\"The plot naturally claims our first notice, and we think that in this Mr. Southey has been very successful. It is highly dramatic, and affords scope for much play both of passion and feeling, though the latter predominates. Its materials are of heroic caliber, sufficiently dignified for the epic tone, yet blended with those topics to which a chord vibrates in every heart, and to relish which the common feelings of our nature are the only requisite qualification.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. p. 190 Like the previous poem, the November review concluded with an emphasis on the notes: \\"We cannot conclude without entering a strong protest against the modern fashion of encumbering a poem with a body of notes, swelled by quotations, which nobody reads, and every body must pay for. It is a heavy tax on the reading part of the community, and we doubt whether it is one which answers in the end even to those who impose it\\".Madden 1972 qtd. p. 193 In 1909, Maurice Fitzgerald claimed, in regards to the description of Florinda's rape and confession, that \\"there are few scenes in English poetry of a more intense dramatic feeling\\".Fitzgerald 1909 p. vi Ernest Bernhardt-Kabisch agreed and claimed the scene as \\"one of the most moving and successful of the poem, and, indeed, was Southey's own favorite.\\"Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 135 However, he went on to argue that \\"The scene is far from perfect. While the perversity of Florinda's past behavior represents an advance from the flatness of Southey's usual character portraits, it still lacks substance to be fully convincing. The brittle illogic of her action seems less an outgrowth of her psychology than a convenience for the poet, enabling him to exculpate the king without simply abandoning the rape motif of the legend. Even so [...] the scene is a touching one, and the predicament it recalls surprises by its humanity. For once Southey seems to have confronted reality without barricading himself behind moral absolutes.\\"Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 136 In 2006, William Spech claimed that Roderick was \\"the last of Southey's long poems, is also the greatest [...] It is a fine, swashbuckling tale, and told with zest.\\" Notes References * Bernhardt-Kabisch, Ernest.

Operational Air Force consisted of 4 fighter, and 4 bomber brigades, one independent bomber group of two squadrons, one independent reconnaissance group of two squadrons, and one independent fighter squadron. In total it numbered 300 airplanes of different types (61 Bf 109 E, 8 IK-2, 6 IK-3, 25 Hawker Hurricane, 30 Hawker Fury, 60 Dornier Do 17, 40 Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, 58 Bristol Blenheim). Army Air Force was equipped with 150 outdated reconnaissance airplanes Breguet 19 and Potez 25. Naval Air Force units were equipped with 150 seaplanes. Operational Air Force suffered heavy losses during the invasion of Yugoslavia. 49 planes were shot down by enemy, 42 were damaged, 85 were destroyed on the ground by enemy, 75 were destroyed on the ground by Yugoslav personnel in order to avoid enemy seizure, 21 broken or damaged on takeoff or landing, 6 were shot down by friendly fire, and only 23 machines continued the fighting: 11 flew to Soviet Union, and 12 to Greece. 1942 The ZNDH flew many missions in support of Army troops in limited scale operations against the Partisans mostly over eastern and western Bosnia, as well as over Croatia using biplane Breguet 19 and Potez 25 aircraft. By September 1941, the ZNDH introduced larger aircraft for bombing Partisan forces and territory. Visual reconnaissance missions using hand-held cameras were also flown. Aerial reconnaissance supplied the Croatian Army with vital data about Partisan movements and positions and about the situation in Partisan territory in general. This was all the more important because the Croatian Army desperately lacked radio equipment of all kinds. Light aircraft were frequently used for liaison duties, particularly connecting the surrounding NDH garrisons and higher command. Often the Army requested one or two aircraft to be temporarily attached to particular Army units to closely co-operate with ground troops.Frka, May 1993, p. 30. In 1942 the ZNDH participated in a large German offensive against the Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia. Initially, the Regia Aeronautica also participated in this campaign, but after a tragic incident where an Italian bomber mistakenly attacked German positions near Vlasenica, the German command assigned the ZNDH the responsibility for providing the entire aerial support mission for formations on the ground. At this time there were no significant Luftwaffe forces based in Yugoslavia. Aside from constant bombing sorties, Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft were also used for daily supply missions to the besieged Croatian Army garrison at Rogatica. They would land under fire at a small improvised grass landing strip, unloading ammunition and other supplies while keeping their engines running and taking off as soon as was possible.Likso, et al., 1998, p. 31. Most of the missions were performed by the 2nd and 3rd Group's squadrons based at Sarajevo, which was the strongest operational base at that time. The Zagreb air base was principally employed in attacking Partisan positions in western Slavonia and Bosnia. Not only did this medium bomber force fly reconnaissance and bombing missions against Partisan forces, but also flew deep into territory under Partisan control and attacked railway stations, road traffic, agricultural depots and food stocks. The Yugoslav Partisan forces were aware of the threat to their operations that the ZNDH provided and were constantly trying to improve their anti-aircraft defence, which relied mainly on machine guns.Frka, June 1993, p. 26. December 1942 also saw the return of the Croatian Air Force Legion (HZL) bomber squadron to Croatia from service on the Eastern Front. Upon its return the Legion's bomber squadron was redesignated 1./(Kroat.)KG after having flown its 9 Dornier Do 17Z bombers from Russia back to Croatia. The Dorniers proved a welcome addition to the strike power of the Axis forces fighting the Yugoslav Partisans right up to the end of 1944.Likso, et al., 1998, p. 34. 1943 On 20 January 1943, the German HQ in Yugoslavia launched an offensive codenamed \\"Fall Weiss\\" (Case White), intending to regain the lost territory. The attack was supported by aircraft from the Luftwaffe, Regia Aeronautica and the ZNDH. Aircraft from the 2nd and 3rd Groups from Sarajevo and the 6th Group from Banja Luka were involved in bombing raids as well as leaflet dropping missions. By mid-1943, following the capture of southern Italy, Allied aircraft started to appear over the Balkans. NDH military command was aware of this danger and was trying to persuade the Germans to provide at least two squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters to the ZNDH. However, instead of Messerschmitts, the only reinforcement fighters that came from Germany were the first of a batch of 36 overhauled captured French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters in October, plus another dozen which arrived in December. The Germans also supplied 25 Beneš-Mráz Beta-Minor sporting two seater monoplanes, which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty, as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron level was still evident.Frka June 1993, p. 29. Attacks on Yugoslav Partisan forces continued however, and on 3 October 1943 seven ZNDH Dornier Do 17Zs caught 2. bataljon of Brigada Braća Radić (2nd battalion of the Radić Brothers Brigade) on the move at Šemovac, on the Varaždin-Ludbreg road. In over one hour's concentrated aerial bombardment, the battalion sustained some sixty casualties, including 42 dead.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 91. 1944/1945 Allied aircraft specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe bases and aircraft for the first time as a result of the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944. Up until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude. Yugoslav Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse for the first time, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.Ciglic, et al., 2007, p. 113. Balkan Air Force Spitfires of the No 352 (Y) Squadron RAF before the unit's first mission on 18 August 1944. The aircraft were based in Canne - Italy, Yugoslav Aeronautical Museum The Allied Balkan Air Force (BAF) was based at Bari in Italy, and activated on 7 June 1944 to take command of operations in the area separately from the Italian campaign. It mainly supported the operations of the Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito, against German and Independent State of Croatia (NDH) forces in Yugoslavia. It transported supplies to the partisans, evacuated wounded, dropped agents to help them, and provided air support in their operations against German and NDH troops. In this it was decisive in enabling the Partisans to withstand the Raid on Drvar (Seventh Offensive). The Allies had begun limited air operations in the Balkans in late 1943 to protect its flank. Aircraft flew anti-shipping missions against the Adriatic coast. This was followed by attacks on strategic facilities.\\"The Balkans and the Middle East\\" The Balkan Air Force was a multinational unit, with 15 types of aircraft and men from eight nations: Greece, Co-belligerent Italy, Poland, South Africa, Yugoslavia (two squadrons of fighters),Savic and Ciglic 2002, p. 74. the UK, USA and USSR (a transport squadron). Between its inception and May 1945 the BAF flew 38,340 sorties, dropped 6,650 tons of bombs, delivered 16,440 tons of supplies and flew 2,500 individuals into Yugoslavia and 19,000 (mostly wounded) out.The Oxford Companion to World War II p. 79. The Dornier Do 17 medium bombers of the ZNDH were still hitting back when and where they could and on 31 December 1944 a Dornier Do 17E attacked an RAF 148 Squadron Handley Page Halifax bomber on the ground at the Partisan airfield at Grabovnica near Čazma, destroying it with bombs. On 10 February 1945, a single ZNDH Dornier Do 17Z caught 1. Zagorska Brigada (1st Zagorje Brigade) marching in the open near Daruvar. The Yugoslav Partisan unit suffered some two dozen casualties.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 118. On 15 April 1945, a force made up of a Dornier Do 17Z, escorted by two Messerschmitt 109Gs destroyed two aircraft of the Yugoslav Partisans at their airfield at Sanski Most.Ciglic and Savic 2007, p. 120. Towards the end of its existence, the BAF operated a small number of units from Yugoslav soil to harass the retreating Germans. However, disagreements with Tito (particularly the arrest of members of the Special Boat Squadron on 13 April 1945, although they were quickly released) meant that all British ground forces were withdrawn, although BAF aircraft operating from Zadar continued to support the Partisan offensive. Between 19 March and 3 May they flew 2,727 sorties, attacking the German withdrawal route from Sarajevo to Zagreb and supporting the Fourth Yugoslav Army advancing from Bihać to Fiume (Rijeka).The Oxford Companion to World War II p. 80. On 16 May 1945 351 and 352 Squadron RAF were administratively transferred to Yugoslav Air Force.

Background  Territory of the First Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century. With the succession of Khan Krum on the Bulgarian throne in 803 began the last and decisive part of the prolonged succession of Byzantine–Bulgarian conflicts which started in 756. For a little over a decade until his death in 814, Krum achieved significant successes over the Byzantine Empire, seizing the important city of Serdica in 809 and decisively defeating the Byzantine armies at the Varbitsa pass and at Versinikia. His son and successor Omurtag tried to continue Krum's aggressive policy but his campaign in 814 was stopped by the Byzantines.Cedrenus, ed. Bon., II, р. 54Zonaras, ed. Dindorfi, III, p. 381 As both countries were exhausted by the sustained military effort, peace negotiations began.  Signing of the treaty  Leo V the Armenian. In the beginning of 815 Omurtag sent emissaries to Constantinople to negotiate the peace. The signing ceremony was a solemn event and performed in the presence of numerous people. The agreement envisaged that the Byzantine Emperor must vow according to the pagan Bulgarian customs and Omurtag's emissaries according to the Christian laws. The Byzantine historians were outraged by the emperor's actions.Ignatii Diaconi. Vita Nicephori in appendices to Nicephori Opuscula historica, ed. C. de Boor, Lipsiae, 1880, p, 206—207 They recorded that the \\"most Christian\\" ruler had to pour out water on the ground from a cup, to personally turn round horse saddles, to touch triple bridle and to lift grass high above the ground.See Andreev, p. 58: The pagan oath of the Bulgars had a deep symbolic meaning. The pouring of water was a reminder that if the oath is broken, blood would pour out. In the same sense was explained the turning of the saddle - a warning that the violator would not be able to ride or would fall dead from his horse during battle. The triple bridle symbolized the toughness of the agreement and the lifting of grass reminded that no grass would remain in the enemy country if the peace was broken. The sacrifice of dogs was a common custom among the Turkic peoples which further strengthened the treaty. Another historian added that Leo V had to even cut up dogs as witnesses to his vow.Andreev, J. The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars (Balgarskite hanove i tsare, Българските ханове и царе), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 58,  Terms  The Bulgarian ruler Omurtag sends delegation to the Byzantine emperor. Byzantine records for the conditions of the treaty have not been preserved, but the first two of the treaty's four articles survive in the Greek-language Syuleymankyoy Inscription:Zlatarski, p. 385 * 1st Article, determining the border between Bulgaria and Byzantium. It started at Debelt near the Black Sea coast and passed along the old trench of Erkesiya up to the upper stream of the river Choban Azmak, a tributary of Tundzha. From there it reached the Maritsa river to the north of Harmanli, near the ancient town of Constantia and continued to the west to the modern village of Uzundzhovo.for the interpretation of the settlements see Zlatarski, Notices for the Bulgarians, pp. 67—68 After that the border continued to an unidentified mountain, most probably one of the ridges of the eastern Rhodope Mountains. According to the Süleymanköy Inscription, the border was ratified to that mountain. The explanation of the historians is that the region of Philippopolis (Plovdiv) was to be transferred to Bulgaria after some years while the Byzantine garrisons gradually withdrew from the area; until that time the borderline followed the old border up to Sredna Gora.Zlatarski, p. 387 The Bulgarians kept some fortresses around Adrianople as a guarantee for the cession of Philippopolis, which were returned to the Byzantine Empire after Khan Malamir (831–836) took possession of the city.Zlatarski, pp. 429-430 With that article the expansion of the Bulgarian borders to the south was officially recognized although the Bulgarians had to return some of the occupied towns, notably Adrianople. Khan Omurtag. * 2nd Article, concerning the exchange of prisoners of war between the two countries. The Bulgarians agreed to release the Byzantines captured during the disastrous campaign of Emperor Nikephoros I in 811, as well as the population captured during the later raids of Krum. The Byzantines had to release the Slavs who had been captured by Leo V, as well as those who inhabited border regions of the Byzantine Empire around Strandzha and the Rhodope, even though some of them had never been subjects of the Bulgarian khans. The article then continued with details for the process of exchange. Notably, the Byzantines not only had to agree to exchange man for man, but also to give two heads of cattle for every released Byzantine soldier, on the condition that their soldiers would return in their homes. In that way the Bulgarians ensured the reduction of the Byzantine border garrisons.Zlatarski, p. 389  Aftermath  Although the treaty was in Bulgaria's favour, it was a welcome respite by the Byzantines, who had to regroup their forces after successive defeats, and who faced another round of internal turmoil because of the revival of iconoclasm. Bulgaria on the other hand also faced religious problems, as the growing number of Christians disturbed Omurtag: the Khan began anti-Christian persecutions, to which his eldest son Enravota also fell victim. The Bulgarians also had to restore their economy following the bloody conflicts of the first decade of the century, while their capital Pliska still lay in ruins. The peace treaty was reaffirmed in 820, when Emperor Michael II seized the Byzantine throne. Omurtag and Michael II additionally agreed to provide help to each other in case of danger. True to his word, in 823 Omurtag relieved the siege of Constantinople by the rebel Thomas the Slav and defeated his army.

History  Work on the line began already in October 1959. Following the 1961 coup, the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction started South Korea's first five-year plan, which included a construction program to complete the railway network, to foster economic growth. The line from Neunggok on the Gyeongui Line to Uijeongbu on the Gyeongwon Line was incorporated into the program and was completed on August 20, 1963. Operation Currently, the line is single-track, unelectrified, sees very little use and has no scheduled passenger service. Irregular freight train service was stopped in October 2013; Ilyeong Station was downgraded to unattended station on January 24, 2014.After that, the line became inoperational and used for model photoshooting etc. more or less legally until test run of freight trains resumed at the end of 2015 until end of January 2016.

Att. 13, 12, 3 \\"biennium praeteriit cum ille Καλλιππίδης adsiduo cursu cubitum nullum processerit\\". The Roman Emperor Tiberius was said to have made preparations almost yearly for a visit to the provinces and the armies stationed there, which he always cancelled at the last minute, with the result that \\"he was jokingly referred to as Callippides, who was known in the Greek proverb to run and make not a cubit of progress\\".Suetonius Tib. 38 \\"ut … per iocum Callippides vocaretur, quem cursitare ac ne cubiti quidem mensuram progredi proverbio Graeco notatum est\\".

Interpretation The proverb scholar August Otto writes that Callippos was apparently a runner who despite all his efforts never reached the finish. Otto suggests that since Callipides is the patronymic of Callippos, it can mean \\"another Callippos\\", so that the original name would be Callippos, as in the Greek collection, rather than Callipides.Otto (1890) 66. Others suggest emending the Greek text to Callippides to agree with the references in Cicero and Suetonius.Leutsch (1851) ad loc.; Shackleton Bailey in his commentary to Cic. Att. 13, 12, 3. Some have seen in him not a runner, but the famous fifth century actor Callippides.See Leutsch (1851) II 757, and Shackleton Bailey in his discussion of Att. 13, 12, 3, both of whom reject the view.

Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is an 1886 novella written by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson. It is about a London lawyer who investigates strange occurrences between his old friend, Dr. Henry Jekyll and the misanthropic Mr. Hyde. The work is known for its vivid portrayal of a split personality, and since the 1880s dozens of stage and film adaptations have been produced, although there have been no major adaptations to date that remain faithful to the narrative structure of Stevenson's original. Most omit the figure of Utterson, telling the story from Jekyll's and Hyde's viewpoint and often having them played by the same actor, thus eliminating entirely the mystery aspect of the true identity of Hyde, which was the original's twist ending and not the basic premise it is today. Many adaptations also introduce a romantic element which does not exist in the original story. While Hyde is portrayed in the novella as an evil-looking man of diminutive height, many adaptations have taken liberties with the character's physical appearance, sometimes depicting him with bestial or monstrous features. There are over 123 film versions, not including stage and radio, as well as a number of parodies and imitations. Troy Howarth calls Stephenson's novella \\"the most filmed work of literature in the silent era.\\". Notable examples are listed below in chronological order.

Book * 1890, The Untold Sequel of the Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Frances H. Little is a 're-telling' of the story based on the idea that Edward Hyde was an actual person, a former actor whom Jekyll had met in America and brought to London, and not the alter-ego of Henry Jekyll. Told from the perspective first of Utterson and then of Hyde, the story recounts Hyde murdering first Sir Danvers Carew in an opium-induced fit of rage, then Jekyll for the inheritance stated in Jekyll's will, and finally hiding Jekyll's body in a secret room in Jekyll's house. Hyde finally tricks Lanyon with a false transformation before committing suicide as in Stevenson's book. * 1979, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Holmes, by Loren D. Estleman, is a 'retelling' of the story based on the idea that Utterson hired Sherlock Holmes to investigate Hyde's connection to Jekyll in the belief that Hyde is a blackmailer. The novel is written in a manner that suggests it was essentially taking place 'behind the scenes' of the familiar storyline, with Utterson hiring Holmes to investigate the apparent blackmail and the Queen herself later asking Holmes to investigate the death of Sir Danvers. The story culminates with Holmes and Watson confronting Hyde just as he consumes the last sample of the potion to turn back into Jekyll, Jekyll telling them his story before forcing Holmes to kill him as he recognizes that Hyde will never commit suicide. In the novel's final chapter, Holmes shares the story with Robert Louis Stevenson, but asks that Stevenson leave Holmes and Watson out of his version of the story to prevent anyone realizing that it is a chronicle of real events and to avoid facing the legal issue of Holmes killing Jekyll even if in self-defence. * 1990, Robert Bloch's The Jekyll Legacy acts as a sequel to the novel, in which Hester Lane, a reporter from Canada, discovers that she's Jekyll's heir. However, someone is continuing Jekyll's experiments. The novel takes an even more sinister turn as Jekyll's butler Poole and Mr. Utterson are bludgeoned to death. *2001, Ludovic Debeurme's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde illustrated edition adapted for young readers. * The Robert Swindells book Jacqueline Hyde concerns the protagonist's struggle with her 'Hyde' after smelling a bottle, the contents of which releases her bad side. * The 2014 Daniel Levine book, Hyde, acts as the original book's companion, telling it from Hyde's perspective, adding new elements to the plot Appearances in other fiction * Mad Monster Party?, a 1967 American animated comedy film, features Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as guests at a party thrown by Baron Boris von Frankenstein. * A \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" character was a part of the \\"1970 Parallel Time\\" storyline (March 27, 1970 - July 17, 1970) of the ABC daytime serial Dark Shadows, where Dr. Cyrus Longworth (played by Christopher Pennock) creates a formula that turns him into the dark-haired, mustachioed and totally evil \\"John Yaeger\\" (also played by Pennock). * Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters, a 1972 American animated \\"prequel of sorts\\" to Mad Monster Party?.

The film adaptation stars Jason Flemyng as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the latter using prosthetic makeup. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are employed by The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to combat The Fantom. The version of Hyde depicted in both comic and movie bears more resemblance to the Hulk than the malevolent dwarf of the novel, possessing great strength and size. As in the comic book on which it is based, this is attributed to Hyde \\"growing, free from boundaries, free from limitations\\" (Although the film version is still dependent on Jekyll drinking the serum to transform rather than Hyde no longer requiring the potion to manifest). * 2004, film Van Helsing. Robbie Coltrane provides the voice of a CGI animated Mr. Hyde, who Van Helsing unintentionally kills at the cathedral of Notre Dame when pursuing him through Paris. Like in The League of Extraordinary Gentleman, Mr. Hyde is also portrayed as a large, hulking brute. When Hyde dies, he transforms back into Dr. Jekyll. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is also the focus of the film's animated prequel Van Helsing: The London Assignment, where Hyde is shown as Jack the Ripper, stealing souls each night for a youth potion that Jekyll, in the guise of a royal physician, uses to restore Queen Victoria's youth and seduce her. * 2008, animated film, Igor: a major character is Jacqueline and Heidi. * 2010, television series, Sanctuary, the character Adam Worth's story was stolen by a former friend and retold under the \\"fictional\\" title of the Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

In this version, Rumplestiltskin helps Dr. Jekyll to create his formula, hoping to benefit from Dr. Jekyll's work. Dr. Jekyll still has evil tendencies at times, and Hyde can be nice. The characters separate and appear in the present day. *In season 10 of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, the serial killer Charles DiMesa aka Dr. Jekyll is active. *In Power Rangers Dino Super Charge, the name of the character Heckyl refers to Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde because he has a split personality and shares a body with Snide. *2017, Russell Crowe plays Dr. Jekyll(and Mr. Hyde) in The Mummy, which is the first installment in the Dark Universe and is a role which will be elaborated on in further films within the series. *An dating sim app by game company NTT Solmare titled \\"Guard me, Sherlock\\" Has a version of Jekyll and Hyde, both characters were created in 2018.

It came into existence when the Sukhumi- Abkhazian Eparchy declared on 15 September 2009 that it no longer considered itself part of the Georgian Orthodox Church and that it was \\"re-establishing the Catholicate of Abkhazia disbanded in 1795\\". Vissarion Aplaa is the Primate of the Abkhazian Orthodox Church since 2009 and is the self-proclaimed catholicos of the Church.It has two eparchies in Pitsunda and Sukhumi and is organized in 9 parishes. History Catholicate of Abkhazia (1470s-1814) The Catholicate of Abkhazia () was a subdivision of the Georgian Orthodox Church that existed as an independent entity in western Georgia from the 1470s to 1814 in areas generally known as Abkhazia presently. The Catholicate of Abkhazia was headed by the Catholicos (later, Catholicos Patriarch), officially styled as the Catholicos Patriarch of Imereti, Odishi, Ponto-Abkhaz-Guria, Racha-Lechkhum-Svaneti, Ossetians, Dvals, and all of the North. The residence of the Catholicoi was at Bichvinta (now Pitsunda) in Abkhazia (hence, the name of the Catholicate), but was moved to the Gelati Monastery in Imereti in the late 16th century. The Abkhazian Orthodox Church considers itself to be the continuation of the Catholicate of Abkhazia. Russian church control (1814-1917) After the conquest of Imereti by Imperial Russia in 1810, the Catholicate of Abkhazia was abolished by the Russian authorities in 1814, by the Russian authorities, and annexed to the Exarchate of Georgia, a subdivision of the Russian Orthodox Church. Consequently, the office of the Catholicos of Abkhazia was abolished by the Russian Empire that said it would take control of the Georgian church. The Catholicate of Abkhazia was disbanded in 1814, and all local dioceses were taken over by the Russian Orthodox Church. Georgian church control (1917-1993) In 1917, following the fall of the Russian Tsar Nicholas II with the Communist Revolution, the dioceses became part of the Georgian Orthodox Church. The Abkhazian orthodox dioceses fell under the canonically recognized territory of the Georgian Orthodox Church as the Sukhumi-Abkhazian eparchy. This move restored the unified and autocephalous Georgian Orthodox Church in 1917 under one Catholicos Patriarch, namely Kyrion II under the title Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia. He was assassinated in 1918. He was succeeded by Leonid of Georgia in 1918. The War and the Intermediate period (1993-2009) The Georgian church control was seriously compromised with the 1992-1993 war in Abkhazia. Ethnically Georgian priests had to flee Abkhazia and the Georgian Orthodox church effectively lost control of Abkhazian church affairs. The last Georgian monks and nuns, based in the upper Kodori Valley, were expelled early in 2009 after they resisted pressure from the Abkhaz authorities to sever allegiance to the Georgian church.Abkhazia: \\"We'll kick out anyone\\". Forum 18. 7 April 2009 The ethnically Abkhaz Vissarion Aplaa was the only remaining priest after the early 1990s war and he became acting head of the Sukhumi-Abkhazian eparchy. In the following years, recently consecrated clerics from the neighbouring Russian Maykop Eparchy arrived in Abkhazia. The new priests (archimandrite Dorotheos Dbar, hieromonk Andrew Ampar, hierodeacon David Sarsania) came into conflict with Vissarion, but through the mediation of Russian church officials, the two sides managed to reach a power-sharing agreement in Maikop in 2005. Under the agreement, the Eparchy would thenceforth have co-chairs and be named the Abkhazian Eparchy with undefined canonical status, to stress its separation from the Georgian Orthodox Church. The agreement did not hold however, when Priest Vissarion refused to share the leadership and continued to sign documents using the old name of the Eparchy.Вновь обострился конфликт внутри православной общины Абхазии.

Retrieved on June 26, 2007 Complete separation and reestablishment of the Catholicate of Abkhazia (2009-present) Abkhazian Orthodox Church standard On 15 September 2009 the leadership of the Sukhumi-Abkhazian Eparchy defying the authority of Ilia ii, Catholicos Patriarch of All Georgia, declared that it no longer considered itself part of the Georgian Orthodox Church, and that it was re-establishing the Catholicate of Abkhazia, and that it would henceforth be known as the Abkhazian Orthodox Church. Its leader Vissarion Aplia asked both the Russian and Georgian Orthodox churches to recognize the \\"Abkhazian Orthodox Church\\". A spokesman for the Georgian patriarchate said the decision to separate from the Georgian Orthodox Church was taken by a \\"group of impostors\\", while the Russian Orthodox Church confirmed that it continued to view Abkhazia as the canonical territory of the Georgian Church.Georgian patriarchy refuses to recognize Abkhaz Orthodox Church.

William Cleaver (1742–1815) was an English churchman and academic, Principal of Brasenose College, Oxford, and bishop of three sees. Life He was the eldest son of the Rev. William Cleaver, who was the headmaster of a private school at Twyford in Buckinghamshire, and his wife Martha Lettice Lushden. He was the elder brother of Euseby Cleaver, Archbishop of Dublin from 1809 to 1819. He was at Magdalen College, Oxford, and after taking his B.A. degree, 1761, was a fellow of Brasenose College; he became M.A. on 2 May 1764. In 1768 he was a candidate for the Bodleian librarianship. The votes between him and his competitor John Price were equal, and the latter was appointed on account of being a few months the senior. Cleaver became tutor to George Nugent-Temple-Grenville. He was successively made vicar of Northop in Flintshire, prebendary of Westminster (1784), Principal of Brasenose College (1785), bishop of Chester (1787), bishop of Bangor (1800), and bishop of St Asaph (1806). He retained the headship of Brasenose until 1809, and almost constantly lived there. At Bangor in 1802, he cautioned an old servant who let apartments against a stray lodger who the bishop thought might be no better than a swindler. This suspicious personage was Thomas De Quincey, who mentioned the incident in his English Opium-eater. Cleaver died 15 May 1815 in Bruton Street, London. He was interested in the higher education of women. Works Among his writings were De Rhythmo Graecorum, 1775, and Directions to the Clergy of the Diocese of Chester on the Choice of Books, 1789. He also edited the edition of Homer printed at Oxford by the Grenville family.

Price was initially elected in April 1996 to succeed his fellow Republican, Paul Spitzfaden, a three-term Mandeville mayor. Background Like his eponymous relative Eddie Price, Eddie Price, III, played football for New Orleans' Jesuit High School and for the Tulane University Green Wave. He was first elected mayor of Mandeville in 1996 after serving on the Mandeville City Council for a 16-year period characterized by exponential growth as well as administration largely free of controversy.Cindy Chang, Scandals threaten Mandeville mayor's political future, New Orleans Times-Picayune, May 17, 2008. Causeway accident During his fourth term as mayor in 2008, Price became increasingly surrounded by scandals, one of them involving a wee-hours accident on April 22, when Price drove a city-owned luxury sport utility vehicle (SUV) into a tollbooth at the north end of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway; he admitted that he had been drinking, but the failure of the causeway police to give the mayor a sobriety test, along with the failure of the police to issuer a ticket until two weeks later when the story was in the hands of news reporters, augmented the controversy.Matthew Penix, Congemi new Causeway chief, Saint Tammany News (Covington, Louisiana), July 25, 2008; .

In February 2009 a petition to recall Price from the mayoralty failed to collect enough signatures prior to its deadline.Doug Mouton, Attempt to recall Mandeville mayor falls short, reported by WWL-TV Channel 4 (CBS-TV affiliate, New Orleans); Bob Warren, Recall petitions face big obstacles, Times-Picayune, February 21, 2009, Saint Tammany Edition, p. B5. At time of failure of the Price recall petition, recall drives on matters unrelated to Price were afoot in adjacent New Orleans—one to recall U.S. Representative Anh \\"Joseph\\" Cao and one to recall New Orleans City Councilwoman Stacy Head. Soon after failure of the recall—and on the same day (March 6, 2009) as the inauguration of a city vehicle policy which Councilwoman Trilby Lenfant criticized as deficient in accountability—Price again began driving the city's SUV, which, according to Cindy Chang in the New Orleans Times-Picayune, ::remains fitted with illegal \\"ghost\\" license plates—untraceable plates intended for use by undercover officers—until the arrival of a new public plate.Cindy Chang, \\"Eddie Price gets city SUV back\\" in Times-Picayune, March 11, 2009, Saint Tammany Edition, pp. A1, A9 (web version = Price returns to driving city SUV). Indictment On August 13, 2009, Price was indicted for perjury in a case against Gary Kopp, owner of SpeeDee Oil Change & Tune-Up Company. Price maintained his innocence and refused to resign even as the Times-Picayune editorially urged him to do so.\\"Mayor Price's failings\\" (editorial) in Times-Picayune, August 14, 2009, p. B4.

A4). Instead, he announced plans to select a new police chief,Cindy Chang, \\"Indicted mayor presses to hire new chief\\" in Times-Picayune, August 23, 2009, Metro Edition, pp. A1, A12. whereupon the Times-Picayune published a second editorial calling for him to resign.\\"Mandeville needs a mayor\\" in Times- Picayune, August 27, 2009, Saint Tammany Edition, p.

Lyons (born 1929) is a former mayor of Houma, president of Terrebonne Parish, and member of the Terrebonne Parish police jury. After retiring to Mandeville, he served for 5 months on the Mandeville City Council in 2000 to complete the unexpired term of Jack McGuire.

Conviction On June 17, 2010, Judge Martin Feldman sentenced Price in U.S. district court in New Orleans on charges of income tax evasion as well as corruption. The sentence was for 64 months to commence on August 12, 2010. Price continued to face sentencing for the perjury charges.Jeff Adelson, Judge scolds Price, gives him five years in Times-Picayune, 2010 June 18, Saint Tammany Edition, pp. A1, A13 (accessed 2010 June 17). Two days before Price's sentence was to begin, Feldman granted a delay of the start of the prison term until September 11, 2010.Jeff Adelson, \\"Price granted 1-month prison reprieve: Ex-mayor will stay free until hearing\\" in Times-Picayune, 2010 August 11, Saint Tammany Edition, pp. A1, A9. On September 29, 2010, Feldman reset the start of the prison term to October 27, 2010 and shortened it to 40 months. The U.S. Attorney's Office agreed Price should be resentenced under the guidelines for traditional mail fraud, which carries a less severe sentence than the crime Price pleaded guilty to. After serving forty months, Price was released in the spring of 2013 from the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. Personal life According to the mayor's biographical sketch on the Mandeville city web site, Eddie and Sarah \\"Sally\\" Price have five children: Shawn, Sarah, Shannon, Eddie and Samantha. Eddie Price, III, a board member for the American Public Works Association (APWA), has served in leadership roles with the St. Tammany Parish Municipal Association, the St. Tammany Homebuilders Association, the Saint Tammany Parish Republican Party Political Action Council, and the St. Tammany Republican Parish Executive Committee).

Auslin, p. 77 British version of events Arrival of the Posadnik On 13 March 1861, the Russian corvette Posadnik (Посадник, 1856), captained by Nicolai Birilev, arrived in Tsushima island in the inlet of Ozaki, the captain demanding landing rights. This event triggered fear in the Japanese Shogunate, as the Russians had already attempted to breach Japan's isolation policy in the northern island of Hokkaido with the events involving Adam Laxman in 1792, the burning of villages there in 1806, and the events leading to the arrest of Vasilii Golovnin in 1811.Negotiating with Imperialism, Michael R. Auslin, p. 78 At that time, only a few Japanese ports were open to foreign ships (Hakodate, Nagasaki, Yokohama), and Tsushima was clearly not one of them, thus suggesting unfriendly intentions on the part of the Russians. If taken over by the Russians, Tsushima could have become an effective base for further aggression. Japan received British help to support its policy.Negotiating with Imperialism, Michael R. Auslin, pp. 78–9 As tension rose, a second Russian ship arrived, and requests were made by the Russians to build a landing base and to receive supplies.Negotiating with Imperialism, Michael R. Auslin, p. 79 Clash A modern replica of Kankō Maru On 13 May 1861, the Russians sent a launch to explore the eastern coast of the island, despite the presence of two Saga Domain warships, Kankō Maru and Denryū Maru, as well as one British warship. On May 21, 1861, a clash took place between the Russian sailors of a launch and a group of samurai and farmers, in which one farmer was killed and one samurai, who soon committed suicide, was captured by the Russians. In mid- July, Hakodate bugyō Muragaki Norimasa went directly to the Russian Consulate in Hakodate, demanding the departure of the ship to the Russian Consul Goshkevitch.Negotiating with Imperialism, Michael R. Auslin, p. 80 Russian retreat As this strategy did not work, the Japanese asked the British to intervene, as they also had an interest in preventing the Russians from extending their influence in Asia. Admiral Hope arrived in Tsushima with two warships on 28 August, and on 19 September 1861 Posadnik finally had to leave Tsushima.Negotiating with Imperialism, Michael R. Auslin, p. 81 Russian version of events Background The late 1850s saw a period of Russian expansion into the Sea of Japan, with the setting up a post in the estuary of the Amur in 1850, the acquisition of the present Primorsky Krai by the Treaty of Aigun (1858) and the Convention of Peking (1860), and the establishment of Vladivostok in 1860. In 1858 the Imperial Russian Navy leased a strip of Nagasaki Bay coastline across the village of Inasa as a winter anchorage for the Chinese Flotilla's emerging Pacific Fleet (all domestic anchorages froze up in winter).Shirokorad, p. 175 Flotilla commander Admiral Ivan Likhachev realized the dangers of basing the fleet in a foreign port,His fears were not improved by the well-publicized murder of unarmed midshipman Roman Mofet in Nagasaki on August 13, 1859 - Shirokorad, p. 180 and settled on establishing a permanent base in Tsushima. He was aware that the British had attempted to set their flag there in 1859 and had conducted hydrographic surveys around the island in 1855.Shirokorad, p. 176 In 1860 he requested a go-ahead from the government in Saint Petersburg; the cautious foreign minister, Alexander Gorchakov, ruled out any incursions against British interests, while General Admiral Konstantin Nikolayevich suggested making a private deal with the head of Tsushima-Fuchū Domain, as long as it did not disturb \\"the West\\". In case of failure the Russian authorities would deny all knowledge of the expedition.Memorandum of Likhachev to General Admiral Great Prince Konstantin of 21 May 1860, in The Central State Navy Archive (St Petersburg), fund 410, folder 2, No. 2386, and No. 2386; further O. Belomor in Morskoi Sbornik', 1914, No.6.' Landing In line with Likhachev's will and Konstantin's advice Posadnik left Hakodate February 20, 1861 and on March 1 reached the village of Osaki on the western coast of Asō Bay (Tatamura Bay in historical reports).Shirokorad, p. 177 Sō Yoshiyori, head of Sō clan, immediately informed the Bakufu government, however, the cautious cabinet of Andō Nobumasa delayed their response and Yoshiyori had to act on his own. Birilev, captain of Posadnik, made personal contact with Sō, exchanged courtesy gifts, and secured Yoshiyori's consent to survey the Imosaki Bay; Posadnik arrived there on April 2. The crew disembarked, raised the Russian flag, and began building temporary housing, a landing jetty and prepared to refit the ship which needed repairs to propeller and stern tube. Japanese officials tacitly agreed with de facto establishing a naval base and even assigned a team of fifteen local carpenters to help the Russians; the latter rewarded Sō with a gift of small naval cannons.Shirokorad, p. 178 Likhachev inspected the bay twice, March 27 on board Oprichnik and April 16 on board Svetlana and recorded friendly behaviour of the Japanese, however, in April the situation irreversibly changed. Clash On April 12, 1861 when the Russians disembarked from their launches, a group of local peasants led by one Matsumura Yasugorō attempted to bar entrance and drive the Russians back. In the ensuing clash Yasugorō was killed, two Japanese peasants taken hostage, the rest fled; no Russian fatalities were recorded. Sō appeased the population, ordering them to wait for a Bakufu pronouncement, and did not take any action. Russian sources say nothing about presence of Japanese or British warship in the area. Aftermath Oguri Tadamasa attempted to negotiate the departure of the Russians from Tsushima in 1861 Japanese Embassy to the United States in 1860) Oguri Tadamasa, the messenger of Bakufu, arrived in Tsushima in May and politely told Birilev to leave; Birilev explained that he would not move unless his own Admiral ordered him to retreat. After 13 days of waiting in vain Oguri left; he left a letter allowing contacts between Birilev and local administration without prejudices against further radical action by the Japanese. Birilev used the permit to the full, and persuaded the council of Japanese officials to issue a charter agreeing with Russian naval presence in Tsushima. Tsushima elders granted the coastline between Hiroura and Imosaki exclusively to the Russians and agreed to bar entrance to any other foreign nation. The charter, however, clearly said that all these concessions depended on good will of the central government. The latter vehemently opposed the deal and called the British envoy Rutherford Alcock for help. Alcock immediately dispatched two ships under command of Vice Admiral James Hope.Shirokorad, p. 179 Retreat Likhachev, as instructed by Konstantin, ordered a general retreat and sent the message to Tsushima with the Oprichnik. Birilev and Posadnik left Tsushima on September 7, 1861, while Oprichnik and Abrek stayed in the harbor; both left at the end of September 1861. Likhachev later said that the failure had its upside: \\"We did not allow the British conquest of the islands\\", an opinion indirectly supported by contemporary personal meetings between Gorchakov and ambassador Francis Napier; the latter, however, never gave a definite answer about British plans in Tsushima. Likhachev was demoted from his command and tendered a voluntary resignation, which was rejected; the admiral was given command of a Baltic Fleet squadron. The Russian Navy stayed at Nagasaki until the completion of the Port Arthur base in China.Shirokorad, p. 180 See also * Sakoku * Empire of Japan–Russian Empire relations Notes Sources * Alexandr Shirokorad (2005).

It is observed for different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of the Indian cultural sphere. Theoretically, there are four seasonal Navaratri. However, in practice, it is the post-monsoon autumn festival called Sharada Navaratri that is the most observed in the honor of the divine feminine Devi (Durga). The festival is celebrated in the bright half of the Hindu calendar month Ashvin, which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October. In the eastern and northeastern states of India, the Durga Puja is synonymous with Navaratri, wherein goddess Durga battles and emerges victorious over the buffalo demon to help restore Dharma. In the northern and western states, the festival is synonymous with \\"Rama Lila\\" and Dussehra that celebrates the battle and victory of god Rama over the demon king Ravana. In southern states, the victory of different goddesses, of Rama or Saraswati is celebrated. In all cases, the common theme is the battle and victory of Good over Evil based on a regionally famous epic or legend such as the Ramayana or the Devi Mahatmya. Celebrations include worshipping nine goddesses in nine days, stage decorations, recital of the legend, enacting of the story, and chanting of the scriptures of Hinduism. The nine days are also a major crop season cultural event, such as competitive design and staging of pandals, a family visit to these pandals and the public celebration of classical and folk dances of Hindu culture. Hindu devotees celebrate Navratri by fasting. But, fasting is not the correct way to please Maa Durga during Navratri or Shradha Navratri. Holy Bhagavad Gita has also denied fasting. It is clearly mentioned in Holy Bhagavad Gita Adhyay 6 Shlok 16 that this Yog Sadhna is not successful for those who sleep too much or don't sleep, nor for those who eat too much or don't eat,i.e., fasting. That's the reason we did not get the true fruits of Worship. On the final day, called the Vijayadashami or Dussehra, the statues are either immersed in a water body such as river and ocean, or alternatively the statue symbolizing the evil is burnt with fireworks marking evil's destruction. The festival also starts the preparation for one of the most important and widely celebrated holidays, Diwali, the festival of lights, which is celebrated twenty days after the Vijayadashami or Dussehra or Dashain. Etymology and nomenclature The word Navaratri means 'nine nights' in Sanskrit, nava meaning nine and ratri meaning nights. Dates and celebrations According to some Hindu texts such as the Shakta and Vaishnava Puranas, Navaratri theoretically falls twice or four times a year. Of these, the Sharada Navaratri near autumn equinox (September–October) is the most celebrated and the Vasanta Navaratri near spring equinox (March–April) is the next most significant to the culture of the Indian subcontinent. In all cases, Navaratri falls in the bright half of the Hindu lunisolar months. The celebrations vary by region, leaving much to the creativity and preferences of the Hindu. # Sharada Navaratri: the most celebrated of the four Navaratri, named after Sharada which means autumn. It is observed the lunar month of Ashvin (post-monsoon, September–October). In many regions, the festival falls after the autumn harvest, and in others during harvest. # Vasanta Navaratri: the second most celebrated, named after vasanta which means spring. It is observed the lunar month of Chaitra (post-winter, March–April). In many regions the festival falls after spring harvest, and in others during harvest. The other two Navratris are observed regionally or by individuals: # Magha Navaratri: in Magha (January–February), winter season. The fifth day of this festival is often independently observed as Vasant Panchami or Basant Panchami, the official start of spring in the Hindu tradition wherein goddess Saraswati is revered through arts, music, writing, kite flying. In some regions, the Hindu god of love, Kama is revered. # Ashada Navaratri: in Ashadha (June–July), the start of the monsoon season. The Sharada Navaratri commences on the first day (pratipada) of the bright fortnight of the lunar month of Ashvini. The festival is celebrated for nine nights once every year during this month, which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October. The exact dates of the festival are determined according to the Hindu lunisolar calendar, and sometimes the festival may be held for a day more or a day less depending on the adjustments for sun and moon movements and the leap year. The festivities extend beyond goddess Durga and god Rama. Various other goddesses such as Saraswati and Lakshmi, gods such as Ganesha, Kartikeya, Shiva, and Krishna are regionally revered. For example, a notable pan-Hindu tradition during Navaratri is the adoration of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of knowledge, learning, music, and arts through Ayudha Puja. On this day, which typically falls on the ninth day of Navaratri after the Good has won over Evil through Durga or Rama, peace and knowledge is celebrated. Warriors thank, decorate and worship their weapons, offering prayers to Saraswati. Musicians upkeep their musical instruments, play and pray to them. Farmers, carpenters, smiths, pottery makers, shopkeepers and all sorts of tradespeople similarly decorate and worship their equipment, machinery, and tools of trade. Students visit their teachers, express respect and seek their blessings. This tradition is particularly strong in South India, but is observed elsewhere too. Significance of each day Navadurga - The nine goddesses worshipped in Navaratri. The festival is associated to the prominent battle that took place between Durga and demon Mahishasura and celebrates the victory of Good over Evil. These nine days are solely dedicated to Goddess Durga and her nine Avatars – the Navadurga. Each day is associated to an incarnation of the goddess: ;Day 1 – Shailaputri Known as Pratipada, this day is associated with Shailaputri (literally \\"Daughter of Mountain\\"), an incarnation of Parvati. It is in this form that the Goddess is worshiped as the consort of Shiva; she is depicted as riding the bull, Nandi, with a trishula in her right hand and lotus in her left. Shailaputri is considered to be the direct incarnation of Mahakali. The color of the day is red, which depicts action and vigor. ;Day 2 – Brahmacharini On Dwitiya, Goddess Brahmacharini, another incarnation of Parvati, is worshiped. In this form, Parvati became Sati, her unmarried self. Brahmacharini is worshiped for emancipation or moksha and endowment of peace and prosperity.

Blue color depicts tranquility yet strong energy. ;Day 3 – Chandraghanta Tritiya commemorates the worship of Chandraghanta – the name derived from the fact that after marrying Shiva, Parvati adorned her forehead with the ardhachandra (lit. half-moon). She is the embodiment of beauty and is also symbolic of bravery.

She is a form of Maha Lakshmi ;Day 7 – Kalaratri Considered the most ferocious form of Goddess Durga, Kalaratri is revered on Saptami. It is believed that Parvati removed her fair skin to kill the demons Sumbha and Nisumbha. The color of the day is White.

The light blue color of the day portrays an admiration towards nature's beauty. Regional practices Navaratri is celebrated in different ways throughout India. Some fast, others feast. Some revere the same Mother Goddess but different aspects of her, while others revere avatars of Vishnu, particularly of Rama. The Chaitra Navaratri culminates in Rama Navami on the ninth day, and the Sharada Navaratri culminates in Durga Puja and Dussehra. The Rama Navami remembers the birth of Rama, preceded by nine days of Ramayana recital particularly among the Vaishnava temples. In the past, Shakta Hindus used to recite Durga's legends during the Chaitra Navaratri, but this practice around the spring equinox has been declining. For most contemporary Hindus, it is the Navaratri around the autumn equinox that is the major festival and the one observed. To Bengali Hindus and to Shakta Hindus outside of eastern and northeastern states of India, the term Navaratri implies Durga Puja in the warrior goddess aspect of Devi. In other traditions of Hinduism, the term Navaratri implies something else or the celebration of Hindu goddess but in her more peaceful forms such as Saraswati – the Hindu goddess of knowledge, learning, music, and other arts. In Nepal, Navaratri is called Dasain, and is a major annual homecoming and family event that celebrates the bonds between elders and youngsters with Tika Puja, as well as across family and community members. Eastern India, West Bengal and Nepal Dashain ritual The Navaratri is celebrated as the Durga Puja festival in West Bengal. It is the most important annual festival to Bengali Hindus and a major social and public event in eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates the religious life. The occasion is celebrated with thousands of temporary stages called pandals are built in community squares, roadside shrines and large Durga temples in West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, eastern Nepal, Assam, Tripura and nearby regions. It is also observed by some Shakta Hindus as a private, home-based festival. Durga Puja festival marks the battle of goddess Durga with the shape-shifting, deceptive and powerful buffalo demon Mahishasura, and her emerging victorious. The last five days of Navratri mark the popular practices during Durga Puja. The festival begins with Mahalaya, a day where Shakta Hindus remember the loved ones who have died, as well the advent of the warrior goddess Durga. The next most significant day of Durga Puja celebrations is the sixth day, called Shashthi where the local community welcomes the goddess Durga Devi and festive celebrations are inaugurated. On the seventh day (Saptami), eighth (Ashtami) and ninth (Navami), Durga along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartikeya are revered and these days mark the main Puja (worship) with recitation of the scriptures, the legends of Durga in Devi Mahatmya and social visits by families to elaborately decorated and lighted up temples and pandals (theatre like stages). After the nine nights, on the tenth day called Vijayadashami, a great procession is held where the clay statues are ceremoniously walked to a river or ocean coast for a solemn goodbye to Durga. Many mark their faces with vermilion (sindooram) or dress in something red. It is an emotional day for some devotees, and the congregation sings emotional goodbye songs. After the procession, Hindus distribute sweets and gifts, visit their friends and family members. North India An 1834 sketch by James Prinsep showing Rama Leela Mela during Navaratri in Benares. In North India, Navaratri is marked by the numerous Ramlila events, where episodes from the story of Rama and Ravana are enacted by teams of artists in rural and urban centers, inside temples or in temporarily constructed stages. This Hindu tradition of festive performance arts was inscribed by UNESCO as one of the \\"Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\\" in 2008.Ramlila, the traditional performance of the Ramayana, UNESCO The festivities, states UNESCO, include songs, narration, recital and dialogue based on the Hindu text Ramacharitmanas by Tulsidas. It is particularly notable in historically important Hindu cities of Ayodhya, Varanasi, Vrindavan, Almora, Satna and Madhubani – cities in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. The festival and dramatic enactment of the virtues versus vices filled story is organized by communities in hundreds of small villages and towns, attracting a mix of audiences from different social, gender and economic backgrounds. In many parts, the audience and villagers join in and participate spontaneously, some helping the artists, others helping with stage set up, create make-up, effigies and lights. The most famous Navaratri festival is organized at Katra in Jammu Province. It is an annual event promoted by Directorate of Tourism, Jammu and Shri Mata Vaishno Deviji Shrine Board. Hundreds of thousands of devotees pay their attendance at Katra for the festival. Navaratri has historically been a prominent ritual festival for kings and military of a kingdom. At the end of the Navratri, comes Dussehra, where the effigies of Ravana, Kumbhakarna, and Meghanada are burnt to celebrate the victory of good (Rama) over evil forces on Vijayadashami. Navratri is also a festival for feasting with friends and family. Elsewhere, during this religious observance, goddess Durga's war against deception and evil is remembered. A pot is installed (ghatasthapana) at a sanctified place at home. A lamp is kept lit in the pot for nine days. The pot symbolizes the universe. The uninterrupted lit lamp symbolizes the Adishakti, i.e. Durga Devi. Bihar In parts of Bihar, Durga Devi is revered during the autumn of Navaratri. In other parts, such near Sitamarhi close to Nepal border, the spring Navratri attracts a large Ramanavami fair which marks the birth of Lord Rama as well as a reverence for his wife Sita who legends place was born at Sitamarhi. It is the largest cattle trading fair and attracts a large handicraft market in pottery, kitchen, and houseware, as well as traditional clothing. Festive performance arts and celebrations are held at the local Hindu temple dedicated to Sita, Hanuman, Durga, and Ganesha.Sitamarhi, Encyclopedia Britannica (2014) Gujarat Navaratri in Gujarat is one of the state's main festivals. The traditional celebrations include fasting for a day, or partially each of the nine days such as by not eating grains or just taking liquid foods, in remembrance of one of nine aspects of Shakti goddess. The prayers are dedicated to a symbolic clay pot called garbo, as a remembrance of the womb of the family and universe. The clay pot is lit, and this is believed to represent the one Atman (soul, self). Garba dancing is a Navaratri tradition in Gujarat. In Gujarat and nearby Hindu communities such as in Malwa, the garbo significance is celebrated through performance arts on all nine days. The most visible is group dances from villages to towns called Garba accompanied by live orchestra, seasonal raga or devotional songs. It is a folk dance, where people of different background and skills join and form concentric circles. The circles can grow or shrink, reaching sizes of hundreds, sometimes thousands of people, dancing and clapping in circular moves, in their traditional costumes, at the same time. The garba dance sometimes deploys dandiyas (sticks), coordinated movements and striking of sticks between the dancers, and teasing between the genders. Post dancing, the group and the audience socializes and feasts together. Regionally, the same thematic celebration of community songs, music and dances on Navaratri is called garbi or garabi. Goa Some regions produce and sell special Navaratri miniature golu dolls, such as of Krishna above. In the temples of Goa, on the first day of the Hindu month of Ashwin, in temples (and some households), a copper pitcher is installed surrounded by clay in which nine varieties of food grains are placed inside the sanctum sanctorum of Devi and Krishna temples. The nine nights are celebrated by presenting devotional songs and through religious discourses. Artists arrive to perform folk musical instruments. Celebrations include placing the goddess image in a specially- decorated colorful silver swing, known as Makhar in Konkani language and for each of the nine nights, she is swung to the tune of temple music (called as ranavadya) and devotees singing kirtan and waving lamps. This is locally called Makharotsav. The last night of the Goa Navaratri festival is a major celebration and attracts larger participation. It is locally called the makhar arati.

This Hindu tradition is so popular that Christian organizations have copied it and ritually observe it inside many churches.Thiruvananthapuram gears up for Vidyarambham day, The Hindu (11 October 2013) However, Navratri traditions of Hindus is not the only tradition observed by Kerala Christians, many other Hindu ritual traditions are celebrated in Churches. Maharashtra Traditionally dressed for Navaratri festival celebrations The Navaratri celebrations vary across Maharashtra and the specific rites differ between regions even if they are called the same and dedicated to the same deity. The most common celebration begins on the first day of Navaratri with Ghatasthapana (sthapana of a ghat), which literally means \\"mounting of a jar\\". On this day, rural households mount a copper or brass jar, filled with water, upon a small heap of rice kept on a wooden stool (pat). Additionally, with the jar, is typically placed other agriculture symbols such as turmeric root, leaves of mango tree, coconut and major staple grains (usually eight varieties). A lamp is lighted symbolizing knowledge and household prosperity, and kept alight through the nine nights of Navaratri. The family worships the pot for nine days by offering rituals and a garland of flowers, leaves, fruits, dry-fruits, etc. with a naivedya, and water is offered in order to get the seeds sprouted. Some families also celebrate Kali puja on days 1 and 2, Laxmi puja on days 3, 4, 5 and Saraswati puja on days 6, 7, 8, 9 along with Ghatasthapana. On the eighth day, a \\"Yajna\\" or \\"Hom\\" is performed in the name of Goddess Durga. On the ninth day, the Ghat puja is performed and the Ghat is dismantled after taking off the sprouted leaves of the grains. In many families, a woman from Matang community is called and offered food and blessings are sought from her. She is considered as a form of the Goddess \\"Matangi\\". The Goddess Lalita is worshipped on the fifth day of the festival. On the ninth day or Khande Navami of the festival, men participate in worshipping all kinds of tools, weapons, vehicles and productive instruments. Girls dressed up for music and dance performance, Amman Navarathiri Tamil Nadu Navaratri has been a historic tradition within Tamil Nadu, with Lakshmi, Saraswati and Durga goddesses the focus. Like the rest of India, the festival has been an occasion for performance arts, particularly Hindu temple dances such as Bharatanatyam and Mohiniyattam. Major palaces, community centers, and historic temples have embedded dance halls. For example, the Padmanabhapuram Palace built about 1600 CE has had a large dance hall with intricately carved pillars, a structure entirely made of stone. This dance hall has traditionally been known as Navratri Mantapa. The festivities begin with Vedic chants inaugurating the dances and other ceremonies. Other Tamil Hindu temples, such as those associated with Sri Vaishnavism, also celebrate the Navarathri festivities. A large sculpted dance hall inside Padmanabhapuram Palace near Kanyakumari is called Navarathri Mandapam. It features goddess Saraswati and large dance hall. Another notable Tamil tradition is a celebration of the festival with Golu dolls (also spelled as Gollu). These include gods, goddesses, animals, birds and rural life all in a miniature design. People set up their own creative themes in their homes, called Kolu, friends and families invite each other to visit their homes to view Kolu displays, then exchange gifts and sweets. This tradition is also found in other parts of South India such as Andhra Pradesh where it called Bommala Koluvu, and Karnataka where it is called Gombe Habba or Gombe totti.'Gombe habba' in all its splendour Deccan Herald (9 October 2013) Evidence of Gombe totti tradition as a Hindu celebration of the artisan arts goes back to at least the 14th-century Vijayanagara Empire. In the evening of \\"Vijayadasami\\", any one doll from the \\"Kolu\\" is symbolically put to sleep and the Kalasa is moved a bit towards North to mark the end of that year's Navaratri Kolu. The family offers a prayer of thanks, and wraps up the display. Golu dolls arrangement in Coimbatore Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu, each and every home will be decorated during the occasion of navaratri. Tamil people all around the world will keep golu in their homes which displays beautiful golu dolls with various puranic background. The daily poojas in the night time will include different offerings to the god such as food (neivedyam), flower decorations, fruits, floral decorations, etc. Then singing devotional songs, reading puranam,traditional prayers will also takes major place. In Tamil Nadu most celebrated deities during navaratri will be the tridevi (\\"Mupperumdevigal\\" in Tamil) , the three major goddesses of Hinduism includes Durgai(Parvati), Lakshmi and Saraswati. On the ninth day of navaratri Ayudha poojai and Saraswati poojai will takes place everywhere in Tamil Nadu followed by the tenth day which will be celebrated as Vijayadasami, the victory day and end of navaratri golu. During Vijayadasami Tamil people will join their children in schools. This practice is because of celebrating the victory. In temples of Tamil Nadu, Navaratri is celebrated for Devi's dwelling in each temple. The temples are decorated, ceremonial lamps are lit, and Vedic chantings are performed. Popular Tamil Nadu temples celebrating Navaratri are Madurai Meenakshi Temple, Chennai Kapaleeswarar temple, Kulasekarapattinam Devi temple, Perambur Ellaiamman temple, Srirangam Ranganathan temple and 8th century Kumari Amman temple. Priests and visitors to some of these temples wear a special yellow colored 'promise of protection' thread on their wrists, called kappu (Tamil) or raksha bandhana (Sanskrit). It is believed to symbolize a vow to the goddess and protection from the goddess against evil.Burton Stein (1977), Temples in Tamil Country, 1300–1750 A.D, The Indian Economic & Social History Review, SAGE Publications, Volume 14, Issue 1, pages 11–45; Carol Breckenridge (1977), From Protector to Litigant, The Indian Economic & Social History Review, SAGE Publications, Volume 14, Issue 1, pages 78–83, 86–93 Telangana A lamp above a Bathukamma flower arrangement, a Telugu Navaratri tradition. In Telangana, Navaratri is celebrated as in the rest of India and it ends with Dasara. During the Navaratri nights, a notable Telangana tradition involves Telugu Hindu women who produce Bathukamma for Navratri goddesses. It is an artistic flower decorations driven event, particularly using marigolds, which revere three different aspects Devi, called Tridevi. In 2016, 9,292 women simultaneously participated to create a 20 feet high flower arrangements, one of the world's largest festive flower arrangement.Bathukamma sets Guinness World Record The New Indian Express (9 October 2016)Thousands of women turn up for Maha Bathukamma, The Hindu (9 October 2016) Bathukamma celebrations will be started with the Mahalaya Amavasya (Pitru Amavasya), a day before actually Navaratri starts. The main deity of worship is goddess Gowri, form of goddess Durga/Parvati who is symbolised or personified with turmeric powder idol and is placed on the floral arrangement called bathukamma. The festival will go for nine nights with women whirling around the bathukamma clapping their hands or with sticks along with recitation of Ramayana, stories of Shiva, Gowri, Ganga and common day-to-day life of women in the form of rhythmic songs resembling Garba and Dandiya at public gatherings. Every night bathukamma is immersed in nearby water resources like ponds or rivers and a new bathukamma is made next day. This nine nights festival end with Durgashtami, when goddesses Durga is believed to be worshipped in the form of Maha Gowri. Like elsewhere in India, Ayudha Puja is observed by Telangana Hindus where weapons are maintained, decorated and worshipped. Tradesmen and farmers similarly clean up, decorate and worship their own equipment of the trade. On the 10th day, i.e. Dussehra (Vijayadashami), grand feasts are arranged with family members and friends. The 10 day long festival ends with Shami (Jammi) puja which is performed at evenings in open spaces, where leaves of plant are exchanged with each other by greeting dussehra wishes and taking blessings of elders symbolising victory over evil and recognizing the importance of shami plant in the epic of Mahabharata. Animal sacrifice Animal sacrifice is a part of some Durga puja celebrations during the Navratri in eastern states of India. The goddess is offered sacrificial animal in this ritual in the belief that it stimulates her violent vengeance against the buffalo demon. According to Christopher Fuller, the animal sacrifice practice is rare among Hindus during Navratri, or at other times, outside the Shaktism tradition found in the eastern Indian states of West Bengal, Odisha and Assam. Further, even in these states, the festival season is one where significant animal sacrifices are observed. In some Shakta Hindu communities, the slaying of buffalo demon and victory of Durga is observed with a symbolic sacrifice instead of animal sacrifice. The Rajput of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses on Navratri, and formerly offered a sacrifice of a goat to a goddess revered as Kuldevi – a practice that continues in some places. The ritual requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. The Kuldevi among these Rajput communities is a warrior-pativrata guardian goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during Rajput-Muslim wars. The tradition of animal sacrifice is being substituted with vegetarian offerings to the Goddess in temples and households around Banaras in Northern India. Outside India The Hindu diaspora that migrated as indentured servants during colonial era to various plantations and mines around the world, as well as those who migrated on their own, continued to mark their Navaratri traditions. Tamil Hindus in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, for example, built Hindu temples in southeast Asia in the 19th century, and Navratri has been one of their major traditional festivals. In Trinidad and United Kingdom, Navratri and Diwali have been one of the most visible celebrations of the local Hindu communities from about mid 20th- century. Simple Golu in New Jersey Post colonial era, the Hindu diaspora around the world continue to value and respect their origin. They continue to celebrate native festivals with joy even though they are miles away from homeland. Other religions Navaratri and goddess worship is mentioned in the historic Sikhism literature, particularly in the Dasam Granth traditionally attributed to Guru Gobind Singh. According to Louis Fenech, the Sikhs have historically mirrored the reverence for Devi Shakthi and the worship of weapons in a manner similar to those by Shakta Hindus. The second Guru of Sikhism, Guru Angad was an ardent devotee of goddess Durga. The Jains have observed the social and cultural celebrations of Navaratri with Hindus, such as the folk dances. The stavan poetry of Jainism, states M. Whitney Kelting, \\"draw much of their imagery from the garba poems\\" of Hinduism.

As such, he was named by American Libraries as one of the 100 most influential people in Library Sciences in the last 100 years.Kniffel, Leonard; Sullivan, Peggy; McCormick, Edith, (1999) '\\"100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century\\".American Libraries, 30,(11), pp. 35-45. Background McCarthy was born in 1908 in Eden Valley, Minnesota and attended St. Thomas College in St. Paul, Minnesota; he earned his BA from Gonzaga University, and his PhD at the University of Chicago.Wedgeworth, Robert (ed.), (1993). World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science. (pp. 527-529). Chicago: American Library Association Career Primarily known for his work in academic libraries, he was one time Executive Director of the Association of Research Libraries. In that role he advised a congressional committee on the 1976 Copyright law about what constituted \\"fair use\\" of copyrighted materials. Principally at issue was the proper use of copyrighted materials as regarded photocopying. The ARL joined fifteen other organizations in developing guidelines and advising the Senate committee on the so-called fair use of copyrighted material.National Commission on New Technology Uses of Copyrighted Works, (1978). Republished: Hollaar,Lee A., (2008). Retrieved September 25, 2009. McCarthy himself was an important player in advocating the revision of copyright laws, and he also “served on the USOE (US Office of Education) Advisory Committee on the Publication of Copyrighted Materials in 1968 and 1969.”Miller, Jonathan, (2008). “Publishers did not take bait,”: A forgotten precursor to NIH Public Access Policy. Presented at Florida Library Association Annual Conference, (p. 13). Retrieved September 23, 2009. While he is most recognized for his influence on fair use laws, he was first and foremost a champion of libraries and librarianship. In his lifetime McCarthy served as Assistant Director of the University of Nebraska Library, Assistant Director of the Columbia University Library, Director of the Cornell University Libraries, President of the New York Library Association, and President of the Nebraska Library Association. His dedication to good librarianship is made evident by the fact that he initially refused to accept the job as Director of Cornell University Libraries because of the poor condition they were in when he arrived at Ithaca. Eventually, he accepted the job because he was promised that the libraries would be brought up to date and have resources available to make them state of the art. McCarthy himself would play a large role in developing the collection at Cornell and his tenure saw the unification of the 16 campus libraries.Cornell University Library History: Cornell’s University Librarians, “Stephen McCarthy,” (2006). Retrieved September 23, 2009 from Cornell University Library. He also undertook a major reclassification project at Cornell, moving the cataloguing system from the Harris system to the Library of Congress Catalogue. The Cornell University Library website boasts that it was during his tenure that the Cornell library system became one of the greatest research library systems in the country. They write, > \\"The staff grew from 70 to 323, while total annual library expenditures > increased from about $360,000 to nearly $3.7 million. Some 170,000 volumes > were added each year under his administration, compared with about 33,000 > annual additions in 1946. Cornell Library’s total collections reached three > million volumes by 1967.\\" The Cornell Library website maintains that his lasting legacy at the University is that he initiated the construction of the Olin Library. McCarthy left a substantial impact on research librarianship as is evidenced by his numerous directorships and committee assignments. He personally advocated financial support for academic and college libraries as he recognized the importance they played in advancing the educational mission of universities.McCarthy, Stephen, (1941). Financial Support of College and University Libraries. University of Illinois, 2005-2009 pp. 105-122. Retrieved September 25, 2009.

It is not known whether the film currently survives,Progressive Silent Film List: The Lady of Red Butte at silentera.com and it may be a lost film. Plot Dorothy Dalton portrays Faro FanFaro Fan inherits a saloon and gambling hall in Red Butte and runs it with such wholesomeness that she has a positive influence on the peaceful town. Fan also devotes her time to the care of a group of orphans she has adopted. Everything is peace and harmony when an evangelist, Webster Smith, arrives in Red Butte. \\"Fanatically devout, crack-brained and believing every word of his intolerant dogma, he calls forth a curse on the gambling house and all who are in it.\\" A fever strikes the town's inhabitants, and Smith takes credit for it. Smith then prays for a fire to cleanse the town and destroy every building except the church as a sign of his wrath and mercy. A fire does sweep through the town, but it destroys Webster's church and every other building in Red Butte except Faro Fan's saloon. The salvation of the gambling house sends the religious fanatic into a rage, and he attacks the Lady of Red Butte. She hits him on the head, and his sanity is restored. He then becomes the personification of love and kindliness and later wins the Lady's heart. Production For the scene showing the destruction of Red Butte, an entire western street was built of solid lumber and then burned to the ground at a cost of several thousand dollars. The village was two blocks long with buildings on both sides of the street. It was built at Inceville on a high elevation far from all other buildings so the flames would not spread to other property. The Santa Monica Fire Department and one chemical wagon from Los Angeles Fire Department were on hand to prevent the flames spreading to the shrubbery and timber on the mountains. When Thomas H. Ince gave the word, the fire was ignited, and the flames were \\"fanned into a fury by three huge wind machines.\\" Between the walls of roaring flames, Dorothy Dalton, Thomas Holding and the two hundred players acted several dramatic scenes, as seven cameras shot the action under the direction of Victor L.

Examples of divine madness can be found in Hellenism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Shamanism. It is usually explained as a manifestation of enlightened behavior by persons who have transcended societal norms, or as a means of spiritual practice or teaching among mendicants and teachers. These behaviors may seem to be symptoms of mental illness to mainstream society, but are a form of religious ecstasy, or deliberate \\"strategic, purposeful activity,\\" \\"by highly self-aware individuals making strategic use of the theme of madness in the construction of their public personas\\". Cross-cultural parallels Yan Hui depicts the crazy-wise Hanshan 寒山. Color on silk. Tokyo National Museum According to June McDaniel and other scholars, divine madness is found in the history and practices of many cultures and may reflect religious ecstasy or expression of divine love. Plato in his Phaedrus and his ideas on theia mania, the Hasidic Jews, Eastern Orthodoxy, Western Christianity, Sufism along with Indian religions all bear witness to the phenomenon of divine madness. It is not the ordinary form of madness, but a behavior that is consistent with the premises of a spiritual path or a form of complete absorption in God. DiValerio notes that comparable \\"mad saint\\" traditions exist in Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic and Christian cultures, but warns against \\"flights of fancy\\" that too easily draw comparisons between these various phenomena. Georg Feuerstein lists Zen poet Hanshan (fl. 9th century) as having divine madness, explaining that when people would ask him about Zen, he would only laugh hysterically. The Zen master Ikkyu (15th century) used to run around his town with a human skeleton spreading the message of the impermanence of life and the grim certainty of death. According to Feuerstein, similar forms of abnormal social behavior and holy madness is found in the history of the Christian saint Isadora and the Sufi Islam storyteller Mulla Nasruddin. Divine madness has parallels in other religions, such as Judaism and Hinduism. Ancient Greece and Rome: theia mania Theia mania () is a term used by Plato and his teacher Socrates to describe a condition of divine madness (unusual behavior attributed to the intervention of a God) in the Platonic dialogue Phaedrus.Plato, Phaedrus, 256b, 244-255. In this work, dating from around 370 BC, the Socrates character describes this state of divine inspiration as follows: Plato further described divine madness as a gift of the gods, with Socrates stating in Phaedrus, \\"in fact the best things we have comes from madness\\", and expounds upon the concept in Plato's Ion. In eastern cultures, it has been deployed as a catalyst and means for the deeper understanding of spiritual concepts. The poet Virgil, in Book VI of his Aeneid, describes the Cumaean Sybil as prophesying in a frenzied state: > ...from her face its color flew, Her twisted locks flowed free, the heaving > breast Swelled with her heart's wild blood; her stature seemed Vaster, her > accent more than mortal man, As all th' oncoming god around her > breathed...http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0054%3Abook%3D6%3Acard%3D42 In the classical world, the phenomenon of \\"love at first sight\\" was understood within the context of a more general conception of passionate love, a kind of madness or, as the Greeks put it, theia mania (\\"madness from the gods\\").Tallis, Frank (February 2005). \\"Crazy for You\\". The Psychologist 18 (2). Most importantly in regards to divine madness in ancient Greek culture were the Maenads and Bacchae. These woman experienced a violent form of madness associated with the god Dionysus. Abrahamic religions Christianity The 6th-century Saint Simeon, states Feuerstein, simulated insanity with skill. Simeon found a dead dog, tied a cord to the corpse's leg and dragged it through the town, outraging the people. To Simeon the dead dog represented a form of baggage people carry in their spiritual life. He would enter the local church and throw nuts at the congregation during the liturgy, which he later explained to his friend that he was denouncing the hypocrisy in worldly acts and prayers. Michael Andrew Screech states that the interpretation of madness in Christianity is adopted from the Platonic belief that madness comes in two forms: bad and good, depending on the assumptions about \\"the normal\\" by the majority. Early Christians cherished madness, and being called \\"mad\\" by non-Christians. To them it was glossolalia or the \\"tongue of angels\\". Christ's behavior and teachings were blasphemous madness in his times, and according to Simon Podmore, \\"Christ's madness served to sanctify blasphemous madness\\". Religious ecstasy-type madness was interpreted as good by early Christians, in the Platonic sense. Yet, as Greek philosophy went out of favor in Christian theology, so did these ideas. In the age of Renaissance, charismatic madness regained interest and popular imagination, as did the Socratic proposal of four types of \\"good madness\\": # Prophesy, the manic art; called Ecstasy, according to Socrates it is caused by the God Apollo # mystical revelations and initiations; called Telestika, caused by Dionysos # poetic arts; called Enthusiasm, attributed to the Muses # madness of lovers; called Delirium, caused by Aphrodite and Eros The theory of the gods causing madness were of course removed by Christianity due to it being a pagan philosophy. In a Christian theological context, these were interpreted in part as divine rapture, an escape from the restraint of society, a frenzy for freedom of the soul. In the 20th-century, Pentecostalism – the charismatic movements within Protestant Christianity particularly in the United States, Latin America and Africa – has encouraged the practice of divine madness among its followers.John Gordon Melton, Pentecostalism, Encyclopaedia Britannica The wisdom and healing power in the possessed, in these movements, is believed to be from the Holy Spirit, a phenomenon called charism (\\"spiritual gifts\\"). According to Tanya Luhrmann, the associated \\"hearing of spiritual voices\\" may seem to be \\"mental illness\\" to many people, but to the followers who shout and dance together as a crowd it isn't. The followers believe that there is a long tradition in Christian spirituality, where saints such as Augustine are stated to have had similar experiences of deliberate hallucinations and madness. Islam: Sufism Other adepts that have attained \\"mad\\" mental states, according to Feuerstein, include the masts and the intoxicated Sufis associated with shath. In parts of Gilgit (Pakistan), the behavior of eccentric faqirs dedicated to mystical devotionalism is considered as \\"crazy holiness\\". In Somalia, according to Sheik Abdi, Moḥammed ʻAbdulle Hassan eccentric behavior and methods led some colonial era writers to call him \\"mad mullah\\", \\"crazy priest of Allah\\" and others. According to Sadeq Rahimi, the Sufi description of divine madness in mystical union mirrors those associated with mental illness. He writes, In West African version of Sufism, according to Lynda chouiten, examples of insane saints are a part of Maraboutisme where the mad and idiotic behavior of a marabout was compared to a mental illness and considered a form of divine folly, of holiness. However, adds Chouiten, Sufism has been accommodating of such divine madness behavior unlike orthodox Islam. Indian religions Hinduism The theme of divine madness appears in all major traditions of Hinduism (Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism), both in its mythologies as well as its saints, accomplished mendicants and teachers. They are portrayed as if they are acting mad or crazy, challenging social assumptions and norms as a part of their spiritual pursuits or resulting thereof. Avadhuta According to Feuerstein, the designation avadhūta (Sanskrit: अवधूत) came to be associated with the mad or eccentric holiness or \\"crazy wisdom\\" of some paramahamsa, liberated religious teachers, who reverted the social norms, as symbolized by their being \\"skyclad\\" or \\"naked\\" (Sanskrit: digambara). Avadhuta are described in the Sannyasa Upanishads of Hinduism, early mediaeval Sanskrit texts that discuss the monastic (sannyasa, literally \\"house-leaver\\") life of Hindu sadhus (monks) and sadhvis (nuns). The Avadhuta is one category of mendicants, and is described as antinomian. The term means \\"shaken off, one who has removed worldly feeling/attachments, someone who has cast off all mortal concerns\\". He is described as someone who is actually wise and normal, but appears to others who don't understand him as \\"mad, crazy\\". His behavior may include being strangely dressed (or naked), sleeping in cremation grounds, acting like an animal, a \\"lunatic\\" storing his food in a skull, among others. According to Feuerstein, \\"the avadhuta is one who, in his [or her] God-intoxication, has \\"cast off\\" all concerns and conventional standards.\\" Feuerstein further states that in traditional Tibet and India, \\"the \\"holy fool\\" or \\"saintly madman\\" [and madwoman] has long been recognized as a legitimate figure in the compass of spiritual aspiration and realization.\\" Bhakti The bhakti tradition emerged in Hinduism in the medieval era. It is related to religious ecstasy, and its accompanying states of trance and intense emotions. According to McDaniel, devotional ecstasy is \\"a radical alteration of perception, emotion or personality which brings the person closer to what he regards as sacred.\\" It may be compared to drsti, direct perception or spontaneous thought, as opposed to learned ideas. The bhakta establishes a reciprocal relationship with the divine. Though the participation in the divine is generally favoured in Vaishnava bhakti discourse throughout the sampradayas rather than imitation of the divine 'play' (Sanskrit: lila), there is the important anomaly of the Vaishnava-Sahajiya sect. McDaniel notes that the actual behavior and experiences of ecstatics may violate the expected behavior as based on texts. While texts describe \\"stages of religious development and gradual growth of insight and emotion,\\" real-life experiences may be \\"a chaos of states that must be forced into a religious mold,\\" in which they often don't fit. This discrepancy may lead to a mistaken identification of those experiences as \\"mad\\" or \\"possessed,\\" and the application of exorcism and Ayurvedic treatments to fit those ecstatics into the mold. McDaniel refers to William James, who made a distinction between gradual and abrupt change, while Karl Potter makes a distinction between progress and leap philosophies. Progress philosophy is jativada, gradual development; leap philosophy is ajativada, \\"sudden knowledge or intuition.\\" Both approaches can also be found in Bengal bhakti. In ritual ecstasy, yogic and tantric practices have been incorporated, together with the idea of a gradual development through spiritual practices. For spontaneous ecstatics, the reverse is true: union with the divine leads to bodily control and detachment. The same distinction is central in the classical Zen-rhetorics on sudden insight, which developed in 7th-century China. The path of gradual progression is called sastriya dharma, \\"the path of scriptural injunctions.\\" It is associated with order and control, and \\"loyalty to lineage and tradition, acceptance of hierarchy and authority, and ritual worship and practice.\\" In contrast, the path of sudden breakthrough is asastriya, \\"not according to the scriptures.\\" It is associated with \\"chaos and passion, and the divine is reached by unpredictable visions and revelations.\\" The divine can be found in such impure surroundings and items as burning grounds, blood and sexuality. Divine experience is not determined by loyalty to lineage and gurus, and various gurus may be followed. According to McDaniel, divine madness is a major aspect of this breakthrough approach. Tibetan Buddhism: nyönpa, drubnyon, and \\"Crazy Wisdom\\" Holy Madmen In Tibetan Buddhism, nyönpa (), tantric \\"crazy yogis,\\" are part of the Nyingma-tradition and the Kagyu-tradition. Their behavior may seem to be scandalous, according to conventional standards, but the archetypal siddha is a defining characteristic of the nyingma-tradition, which differs significantly from the more scholarly orientated Gelugpa-tradition. Its founder, Padmasambhava (India, 8th century), is an archetypal siddha, who is still commemorated by yearly dances. Milarepa (c.1052–c.1135 CE), the founder of the Kagyu-school, is also closely connected to the notion of divine madness in Tibetan Buddhism. His biography was composed by Tsangnyön Heruka (1452-1507), \\"the Madman of Tsang,\\" a famous nyönpa. Other famous madmen are Drukpa Kunley (1455–1529) and the Madman of Ü. Together they are also known as \\"the Three Madmen\\" (smyon pa gsum). Indian siddhas, and their Tibetan counterparts, also played an essential role in the Tibetan Renaissance (c.950-1250 CE), when Buddhism was re-established in Tibet. According to DiValerio, the Tibetan term nyönpa refers to siddhas, yogins and lamas whose \\"mad\\" behavior is \\"symptomatic of high achievement in religious practice.\\" This behavior is most widely understood in Tibet as \\"a symptom of the individuals being enlightened and having transcended ordinary worldly delusions.\\" Their unconventional behavior is seen by Tibetans as a sign of their transcendence of namtok (Sanskrit: vipalka), \\"conceptual formations or false ideations.\\" While their behavior may be seen as repulsive from a dualistic point of view, the enlightened view transcends the dualistic view of repulsive and nonrepulsive. It is regarded as manifesting naturally, not intentionally, though it is sometimes also interpreted as intentional behavior \\"to help unenlightened beings realize the emptiness of phenomena, or as part of the yogin's own training toward that realization.\\" It may also be seen as a way of training, to transcend the boundaries of convention and thereby the boundaries of one's ordinary self- perception, giving way to \\"a more immediate way of experiencing the world - a way that is based on the truth of emptiness, rather than our imperfect habits of mind.\\" While the well-known nyönpa are considered to be fully enlightened, the status of lesser-known yogins remains unknown, and the nature of their unconventional behavior may not be exactly determinable, also not by lamas.'''' According to DiValerio, the term drupton nyönpa is regarded by Tibetans as an oxymoron, a \\"contradictio in terminis\\": Yet, DiValerio also argues that their unconventional behavior is \\"strategic, purposeful activity, rather than being the byproduct of a state of enlightenment,\\" and concludes that \\"the \\"holy madman\\" tradition is constituted by highly self-aware individuals making strategic use of the theme of madness in the construction of their public personas,\\" arguing that Crazy Wisdom In some Buddhist literature, the phrase \\"crazy wisdom\\" is associated with the teaching methods of Chögyam Trungpa, himself a Nyingma and Kagyu master, who popularized the notion with his adepts Keith Dowman and Georg Feuerstein. The term \\"crazy wisdom\\" translates the Tibetan term drubnyon, a philosophy which \\"traditionally combines exceptional insight and impressive magical power with a flamboyant disregard for conventional behavior.\\" In his book Crazy Wisdom, which consists of transcripts of seminars on the eight aspects of Padmasambhava given in 1972, the Tibetan tülku Chögyam Trungpa describes the phenomenon as a process of enquiry and letting go of any hope for an answer: Since Chögyam Trungpa described crazy wisdom in various ways, DiValerio has suggested that Trungpa did not have a fixed idea of crazy wisdom. According to DiValerio, Keith Dowman's The Divine Madman: The Sublime Life and Songs of Drukpa Kunley is \\"the single most influential document in shaping how Euro- Americans have come to think about Tibetan holy madman phenomenon.\\" Dowman's understanding of the holymadmen is akin to the Tibetan interpretations, seeing the Tibetan holy madmen as \\"crazy\\" by conventional standards, yet noting that compared to the Buddhist spiritual ideal \\"it is the vast majority of us who are insane.\\" Dowman also suggests other explanations for Drukpa Künlé’s unconventional behavior, including criticising institutionalized religion, and acting as a catalysator for direct insight. According to DiValerio, Dowman's view of Künlé as criticising Tibetan religious institutions is not shared by contemporary Tibetan religious specialist, but part of Dowman's own criticism of religious institutions. DiValerio further notes that \\"Dowman’s presentation of Drukpa Künlé as roundly anti-institutional [had] great influence [...] in shaping (and distorting) the Euro-American world’s thinking on the subject.\\" According to Feuerstein, who was influenced by Chogyam Trungpa, divine madness is unconventional, outrageous, unexpected, or unpredictable behavior that is considered to be a manifestation of spiritual accomplishment. This includes archetypes like the holy fool and the trickster. Immediatism Arthur Versluis notes that several or most of the teachers who are treated by Feuerstein as exemplary for divine madness, or crazy wisdom, are exemplary for immediatism. These include Adi Da, the teacher of Feuerstein, and Rajneesh. \\"Immediatism\\" refers to \\"a religious assertion of spontaneous, direct, unmediated spiritual insight into reality (typically with little or no prior training), which some term \\"enlightenment\\".\\" According to Versluis, immediatism is typical for Americans, who want \\"the fruit of religion, but not its obligations.\\"American Gurus: Seven Questions for Arthur Versluis Although immediatism has its roots in European culture and history as far back as Platonism, and also includes Perennialism, Versluis points to Ralph Waldo Emerson as its key ancestor, who \\"emphasized the possibility of immediate, direct spiritual knowledge and power.\\" Versluis notes that traditional Tibetan Buddhism is not immediatist, since Mahamudra and Dzogchen \\"are part of a fairly stricted controlled ritual and meditative practice and tradition.\\" yet, he also refers to R.C. Zaehner, \\"who came to regard Asian-religion-derived nondualism as more or less inexorably to antonimianism, immorality, and social dissolution.\\" Versluis further notes that in traditional Mahamudra and Dzogchen, access to teachings is restricted and needs preparation. Versluis further notes that immediatist teachers may be attractive due to their sense of certainty, which contrasts with the post-modernist questioning of truth- claims. He further notes the lack of compassion which is often noted in regard to those immediatist teachers. Shamanism According to Mircea Eliade, divine madness is a part of Shamanism, a state that a pathologist or psychologist is likely to diagnose as a mental disease or aberrant psychological condition. However, state Eliade and Harry Eiss, this would be a misdiagnosis because the Shaman is \\"in control of the mystic state, rather than the psychotic state being in control of him\\". A Shaman predictably enters into the trance state, with rituals such as music and dance, then comes out of it when he wants to. A mental illness lacks these characteristics. Further, at least to the participants, the Shaman's actions and trance has meaning and power, either as a healer or in another spiritual sense.

Life and career Born in Waterford, Ireland, Stewart grew up in Dublin. He began playing guitar when he was thirteen, influenced by guitarists Les Paul and Barney Kessel. Stewart began his professional career performing in Dublin showbands. In 1968 he won an award as the most outstanding soloist at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Soon after, he spent three years with Benny Goodman. Stewart recorded his debut album, Louis the First in Dublin, and then recorded in London with Billy Higgins, Peter Ind, Sam Jones, Red Mitchell, and Spike Robinson. From the mid to late 1970s he worked with George Shearing, touring America, Brazil, and playing European festivals, and recording eight albums, including several for the MPS label in a virtuosic trio with Shearing and the great Danish bassist Niels-Henning Orsted-Pedersen. Louis has also appeared on albums by Joe Williams and J. J. Johnson, and worked with many of the greatest names in jazz. The best Jazz musician he played with was, of course, Tubby Hayes.

His up-tempo virtuosity is balanced by a laid-back approach to ballads, which catches the mood of the piece without sacrificing the rhythmic emphasis that keeps it moving.\\" Stewart was prominently featured in Norman Mongan's important book \\"The History Of The Guitar In Jazz\\" (1983; Oak Publications) in a chapter devoted to guitarists who were considered to be contemporary masters (along with players like Jim Hall, Pat Martino, and George Benson). In a review of Stewart's tour de force live album Overdrive (Hep, 1993), AllMusic stated, \\"Louis Stewart is one of the all-time greats, and it is obvious from the first notes he plays on any occasion\\". Stewart received an honorary doctorate from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1998. In 2009, he was elected to Aosdána, an Irish affiliation of people engaged in literature, music, and visual arts that was established by the Irish Arts Council in 1981 to honour those whose work has made an outstanding contribution to the creative arts in Ireland.

Bred in Maryland by Jim and Eleanor Ryan and raced under their Ryehill Farm banner, he had a record of 27: 11-8-2 with career earnings of $716,426. Early career Smarten was a versatile horse that won in route races and won sprint, he won on the dirt and won on the turf. Smarten was also a very consistent colt that performed well and gave his all in every outing. His winning percentage of 11 out of 27 of 41% is exceptional, but his in-the-money percentage of 22 of 27 lifetime towers over all but the greatest of thoroughbreds racing over two dozen times at an incredible 81%.Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database . In his two-year-old season he won four of five races that included a maiden win, an allowance win and two stakes wins. He won the City of Miami Handicap a stakes race for two-year-olds at Calder Race Course. Smarten also won the Senatorial Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse in the winter of 1978. Three- year-old season In his sophomore year of 1979, Smarten, trainer Woody Stephens and jockey Sam Maple teamed up to accomplish accolades that connections of any colt would be proud of. Smarten placed in the top three in 15 of 17 races in one year including six graded stakes wins - Woodlawn, Illinois Derby, Pennsylvania Derby, Ohio Derby, American Derby, Marylander in a row! Also, six graded stakes runner-up finishes - in a row - Travers, Secretariat, Lawrence Realization, Rutgers, Meadowlands Cup, Discovery. Maple rode Smarten to wins in four grade two Derbys, capturing the Illinois, the Pennsylvania Derby, the American and the Ohio while placing a close second by a head in the grade two Arkansas Derby. His trainer was meticulous about planning and picking the right spots for his colt. Stephens intentionally avoided hooking up with that year's super horse Spectacular Bid in the Triple Crown races.

St Thomas' Bay (), also known as the Bay of Żejtun (), is a bay in southeastern Malta, located in the limits of the seaside town of Marsascala, formerly in the limits of Żejtun. About The bay takes its name from an ancient medieval chapel dedicated to St Thomas the Apostle. The exact location of the chapel cannot be ascertained, however, its location is linked to a shrine to St Thomas on the main road to Żejtun. Historically, the bay formed part of the nearby town of Żejtun, which lies immediately uphill of the inlet. The bay and Munxar point are popular with residents of Żejtun and other inland villages for swimming, hunting and bird-trapping. Some historians contend that St Thomas' Bay marks the true landfall of the Paul the Apostle following his shipwreck on Malta. This theory is based on both geography, as well as archaeological findings of ancient Roman anchors in the bay. St Thomas' Bay includes a number of fortifications, including the Grade 1 scheduled Riħama Battery at its southern end. A large fortress, St Thomas tower was built at the tip of Il-Gżira ta' Wied il-Għajn in 1614 after an Ottoman fleet anchored in the bay and raided Żejtun. The town of Marsascala developed on the northern shores of the bay, while the headland of Il-Munxar forms the southern edge of the bay. The bay contains a number of smaller inlets, some with sand, while the bay also serves as a harbour for a number of small boats. In its inner creek, there are a number of boathouses.  Munxar headland  In this 1681 map, the name La Serta is used to describe the stacks and reefs at the tip of Munxar Bay. Italian word for a saw, a tool which in Maltese is called munxar. Four sea stacks can be seen in this 1767 map by John Brekell, in his book Euroclydon: or the dangers of the sea considered and improved, in some reflections upon St. Paul's voyage and shipwreck. Munxar headland (Maltese: Ras il-Munxar) is a rock-bound peninsula on the southern edge of the bay. The headland takes its name from a number of stacks, long since eroded into submerged reefs, which used to extend into the Mediterranean sea from Munxar point. The old Italian placename for the stacks jutting out of the headland was La Serta (English: The Wreath). In other maps, the group of stacks is called La Serra, that is, 'the saw.' The Maltese word for saw is 'Munxar.' The headland is an unspoiled part of the Delimara peninsula, facing St. Thomas' Bay. It has a number of terraced fields, and commands good views of the bay from its heights. The fields are typical Maltese agricultural land, consisting of small plots. The soil depth is less than two feet on average, containing mainly silty-sandy soil. The plots are terraced on levels with rubble walls. As Munxar lacks water supply, the site is only viable to be cultivated by winter crops like fodder. Part of the promontory forms part of a designated national park, and the headland is a scheduled Area of High Landscape Value. Munxar headland is close to the recorded megalithic remains at Xrobb l-Għaġin, and includes a number of fortifications, including St. Paul's tower and chapel. french occupation of malta. Munxar headland today. St Thomas' Bay can be seen in the background. In 1995, the land was proposed for development into a tourist village, but the plans were successfully resisted by residents and activists of the surrounding villages, and were shelved in 1996. More recent applications were filed for an agri-tourism village and for solar farms. These were either deemed incompatible with the area or withdrawn.  Notes  : [A]. Munxar headland should not be confused with a village in Gozo with the same name.

Mass, M.D. (born June 11, 1946) is an American physician and writer. A co-founder of Gay Men's Health Crisis, he wrote the first press reports on the epidemic that later became known as AIDS. He is the author of numerous publications on HIV, hepatitis C, STDs, gay health, psychiatry and sex research, and on music, opera, and culture. He is also the author/editor of four books/collections. In 2009 he was in the first group of physicians to be designated as diplomates of the American Board of Addiction Medicine. Since 1979, he has lived and worked as a physician in New York City, where he resides with his life partner, writer and activist Arnie Kantrowitz. Having written for the New York Native since the 1970s, he currently writes a column for The Huffington Post. An archival collection of his papers are at the New York Public Library. Biography Mass was born in Macon, Georgia, in 1946, received his B.A. from the University of California at Berkeley in 1969, and his M.D. from the University of Illinois's Abraham Lincoln School of Medicine in 1973. Completing his residency in anesthesiology at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital (in association with Harvard Medical School), Mass encountered homophobia during his interviews in Chicago for a residency in psychiatry when he disclosed that he was gay. This treatment became the catalyst for his activism that he pursued via journalism, making him the first openly gay physician to write on a regular basis for the gay press. Early focus on psychiatry Mass focused initially on the field of psychiatry, which retained many of its past homophobic practitioners, practices and positions even after the American Psychiatric Association in 1973 declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder. Besides writing for the gay press, Mass became newsletter editor for the Gay Caucus of Members of the American Psychiatric Association, the fledgling organization of gay psychiatrists that began organizing in the aftermath of the declassification. Under Mass, the newsletter ran politically charged headlines such as its first, \\"Psychoanalytic Statute Prevents Legal Entry of Gay Aliens,\\" calling attention to the fact that discredited psychoanalytic theories of \\"the homosexual\\" as a form of \\"psychopathic personality\\" were still sources of discriminatory public policies. Writing for the gay press His writing for the gay press examined the leading roles of sociology and sex research in shaping contemporary thinking about sexuality and homosexuality. Mass chronicled the shift in academic and scientific thinking about homosexuality and sexuality. He conducted and published many interviews with such leading figures in the discourse as Judd Marmor, Richard Pillard, Thomas Szasz, John Money, Charles Silverstein, Masters and Johnson, Richard Green, Mary Calderone, John Boswell, John D'Emilio and Estelle Freedman, and Martin Duberman. A selection of these interviews is republished in his two Dialogues of the Sexual Revolution collections. As a physician writing for the gay press, Mass also was one of the first to address the 1970s spread of a number of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis B and amebiasis. In May 1981, Mass authored the first press report appearing in the New York Native, followed in July 1981 by the first feature article, \\"Cancer in the Gay Community,\\" on the then-new HIV/AIDS epidemic. \\"Disease Rumors Largely Unfounded\\" was the headline of Mass's article. The New York Native cover story was among the opening displays of the Newseum in Arlington, Va., now in Washington, DC. Mass continues to report on HIV/AIDS. Co-founder of Gay Men's Health Crisis In 1982, Mass joined Larry Kramer, Edmund White, Paul Rapoport, Paul Popham and Nathan Fain in co-founding Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC), the world's first and still largest AIDS information and service organization. For 10 years, through four revisions, Mass authored GMHC's guide, Medical Answers About AIDS, which usually concluded with an appeal for civil liberties for sexual minority persons and the sanctioning of same sex relationships as \\"essential considerations in the preventive medicine of AIDS and other STDs.\\" At the start of the AIDS epidemic, the issue of anti-Semitism also interested Mass. As described on the dust jacket of his memoir, \\"Confessions of a Jewish Wagnerite\\": \\"Confessions of a Jewish Wagnerite\\" is the story of Mass's voyage of discovery from his adolescent infatuation with Wagner to his friendship with the great-grandson of the composer and life- partnership with a fellow gay activist and Jewish-American writer. Editor of anthology on Larry Kramer Mass's entangled concerns about Jews, Jewishness, anti-Semitism, and the internalization of antisemitism provide an unanticipated lens through which to view the subject of his subsequent book, a collection on the life and legacies of author and AIDS activist Larry Kramer. The anthology We Must Love One Another or Die: The Life and Legacies of Larry Kramer begins with \\"Larry versus Larry,\\" the story of Mass's sometimes stormy 40-year relationship with Kramer, and includes contributions from a number of key figures from the AIDS movement, including historical and critical evaluations by Rodger McFarlane, Anthony Fauci, Michelangelo Signorile, Gabriel Rotello, Tony Kushner, and John D'Emilio. While Kramer is likely to remain best known for his achievements around AIDS and grass roots activism, Mass was most inspired by Kramer's experience as a writer, especially his very personal voice, bravery and perseverance in the face of harsh criticism and rejection. Chapters by Andrew Holleran, Christopher Bram, Alfred Corn, Michael Denneny and others complete the picture of, as the dust jacket puts it, \\"one of the most original and influential voices of the twentieth century.\\" Ongoing interest in gay health issues By the mid-1990s, thanks largely to the efforts of Kramer and ACT UP, HIV infection had become largely manageable with medical care, and gay activist concerns began to shift. Mass has continued to write about more recent health problems afflicting gay men, including the escalation of HIV among minority teens and the elderly, the crystal meth epidemic, hepatitis C and anal cancer. Beginning in the late 1990s, Mass extended his public health interests to the bear subculture of the gay community. He has addressed in a regular column a range of health topics of interest to this subculture, initially consisting of middle-aged overweight men, first for American Bear Magazine and later for A Bear's Life magazine. The papers of Mass and Kantrowitz are designated for deposit with the New York Public Library.
