It compiles electronic dance tracks of acts including Claude VonStroke, Flying Lotus and R√∂yksopp. It featured sound effects and dialog from the Star Wars films, but does not contain any of John Williams' music for the series. Hollywood Records and American Recordings released Star Wars Headspace in digital forms on February 19, 2016 and in physical forms on March 18, to decent commercial performance, beginning at number one on the United States Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart and becoming the second various artists compilation to top the chart. However, it also garnered a mixed response from music critics, praise going towards its eccentric concept and criticism that it would likely only be enjoyed by fans of the film series. Composition Star Wars Headspace is a compilation album of electronic dance music featuring sound effects and samples from the Star Wars films. Musicians Rick Rubin and Kevin Kusatsu, who executively produced the album, gave the producers files of these sounds, but were also instructed by Lucasfilm to not sample any of John Williams' score from the films. Flying Lotus, who said that he was proud of being a part of the project, felt that the concept made sense given that the sounds used in the Star Wars would be a precursor of what was yet to come in electronic music. Therefore, he felt \\"close\\" to the sounds he was using to reflect the universe of the films. Critic Jonah Bromwich analyzed that the beginning half of Star Wars Headspace consists of the producers sampling from the movie while making music in their common style, making it feel like \\"obvious tribute material\\". The first track, Kaskade's \\"C-3P0's Plight\\", represents Star Wars' humor and C-3PO's melodramatic character aspect, featuring sounds of Wookiee's roar and shots from a Blaster weapon. Rubin's Trap remix of \\"Jabba Flow\\", a composition by J.J. Abrams and Lin-Manuel Miranda used in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, is the fifth track on the compilation, which is followed by Claude VonStroke's \\"R2 Knows\\", featuring vocals from Barry Drift and described in a review by Pitchfork Media as a silly anthem similar to releases from Todd Terje. Another track by Rubin, \\"NR-G7\\", has many samples such as R2-D2 blips playing over a \\"driving\\" four on the floor instrumental with \\"dazzling jet-stream\\" synthesizers. However, Bromwich also wrote that the later songs on the track list focus less on the artists making music in their typical trend and more on replicating what made John Williams score so great. Consequence of Sound's Derek Staples noted Norwegian duo R√∂yksopp's ‚ÄúBounty Hunters‚Äù to be less of a bright song and more of a dark synthwave track than their usual material. \\"Sunset Over Manaan\\" by Attlas, a producer signed under the label mau5trap, has a melody reminiscent of Williams' \\"Leia's Theme\\", and has a more \\"cinematic\\" atmosphere than his previous work. The record closes with \\"Star Tripper\\" by French producer Breakbot, a downtempo funk song featuring orchestration reflecting the neo-romantic aspect of Williams' soundtrack. Promotion and release On February 8, 2016, the release date and cover art of Star Wars Headspace was announced, and pre-ordering of the record began. That same day, Beats 1, an Apple Music radio show by New Zealand DJ and producer Zane Lowe, promoted the compilation with an interview with Flying Lotus about his involvement, as well as premiering three tracks, \\"Cantina Boys\\", \\"NR-G7\\" and \\"R2 Where R U?\\"; the latter song was a \\"World Record\\" premiere. \\"Help Me!\\" was released on Beats 1 a day later, while on February 18 the channel Freeform premiered \\"Force\\" shortly before the album's midnight release. Hollywood Records issued the album in digital form on February 19, 2016, followed by a physical release on March 18. Selling 3,000 copies in the United States on its first Billboard chart week, Star Wars Headspace topped the Dance/Electronic Albums chart, the first various artists compilation to do so on the chart since 2008's High School Musical 2: Non-Stop Dance Party. It also landed at number 197 on the nation's Billboard 200 and at number eight on the magazine's Compilation Albums chart. In the United Kingdom, the album landed on the Official Charts Company's UK Dance Albums Charts at number twenty and number twenty-two on the Official Charts Company's Soundtrack Albums Chart. Critical reception Critical response to Star Wars Headspace was mixed, holding a weighted mean of a 48 out of 100 on the site Metacritic based on seven reviews. Drew Mcweeny reviewed it for One Thing I Love Today, his daily column on HitFix which is meant to highlight certain aspects of modern-day popular culture. He honored the compilation's concept of an EDM Star Wars tribute as funny: \\"I'm not sure how long I'll listen to it, because in the end, it's still an hour or so of EDM, but it was a delightful soundtrack to a busy weekend, and all of the small surprises built into it should make it something that any Star Wars fan will be able to easily enjoy.\\" A correspondent for The Boston Globe wrote that it was much better than he expected it to be, giving all credit to the producers who contributed to the compilation. Los Angeles Times critic Randall Roberts spotlighted the distinguishing characteristic of each song. Bromwich, who wrote a review for Pitchfork, scored the release a 6.9 out of ten, highlighting the record's goal of just being \\"simple fun\\" and \\"Neither [a] stale tribute nor sloppy lovefest\\". At the same time, however, he also disliked that the nostalgic style was seemingly \\"a way of avoiding risk\\". The album also garnered numerous mixed reviews that felt that it would only be enjoyed by fans of the franchise; Staples described the tracks as \\"musical fan fiction ready for both celestial dance floors and distant forgotten landscapes\\", while Jon Dolan, reviewing for Rolling Stone magazine, rated it two and a half stars out of five, feeling that many of the producers involved with the project didn't experiment enough with the concept that it was \\"hard to get beyond timid fanboy reverence.\\" The harshest review came from Sam Goldner of Tiny Mix Tapes, who bashed the album as a major contributing factor to \\"the nasty details, the blemishes, the facts of this world that truly corrupt our collective sense of well-being and hope\\" in regards to how the Star Wars franchise has been marketed.

He was linked with the Albanian independence movement in Kosovo. In 1938, he killed the Yugoslav Serbian Chetnik vojvoda (captain), Miliƒá Krstiƒá (known as Mili√ß K√´rrsta in Albanian) for his repressive measures against local Albanians. A few months later, he was himself killed. Numerous folk songs have been composed for his deed. His tomb in Cerrca has become a monument and in June 2019, the constitutional process for him to be named Hero of Kosovo began. Life and family Selman Kadria was born in the village of Cerrc√´, near Istok, Ottoman Empire. His father was Kadri Feriz Hasanaj and his mother was Fatime from the nearby village of Moistir. He was born in a poor family and was farmer, land worker and folk singer. He was known for his folk singing and was frequently invited to sing in weddings in the villages of Istok. He married Zoj√´ Blakaj from the nearby village of Vrella. He had one son, Jashar and two daughters, Shkurte and Rroshe. His son was three years old when Kadria was killed. Jashar Selman Hasanaj had five sons and two daughters. His descendants live in the US.  Assassination of Miliƒá Krstiƒá and death After World War I, Istok became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Life for local Albanians was harsh in this period as the new Yugoslav, predominantly Serbian administration engaged in extensive repressive measures against them. The situation further deteriorated when the Yugoslav colonization of Kosovo began. The Yugoslav gendarmerie and Chetnik paramilitary formations were the main organizer of these repressive measures at the local level. Miliƒá Krstiƒá was a Chetnik vojvoda (captain) who led such a paramilitary formation in Istok. Selman Kadria occasionally worked as a land worker for Krstiƒá, who had become a wealthy landowner through his connections to the state apparatus. Whether Kadria's assassination of Krstiƒá was part of a larger plan of the Albanian independence movement in Kosovo remains unknown. Interviews of local witnesses by historians many years after the events, have so far revealed that Kadria acted together with his close friends, folk singers Brahim Uk√´ Kabashi and Ali Kabashi (in other accounts Brahim Rexhaj is named as the third associate). They had three targets: Miliƒá Krstiƒá, Arsen Peroviƒá and Arsen ƒÜiriƒá. In the original plan, Kadria was to kill Peroviƒá and Brahim Kabashi was to kill Krstiƒá, but they switched targets because it made it easier to approach the targets as the would-be assassins in the revised plan were active in the same villages as the would-be targets. After the killings, the three men would meet in the mountainous location √áarrista e Januzajve and then would cross the Yugoslavia-Albania border outside the reach of the Yugoslav gendarmerie. Of the three, only Selman Kadria carried out the plan. It remains unclear why the other two men never put forward the plan. In some accounts, they have been accused of abandoning it and in others, it is mentioned that they were captured immediately after Krstiƒá's assassination and had no time to execute it. The details of the act itself remain unclear, but what is known is that it took place at the banks of the Istok River possibly during a fishing activity and that Kadria used Krstiƒá's own weapon to kill him. In oral history and songs, many versions of the final dialogue between the two have been produced which mainly focus on themes of revenge. The location of the event to this day is known as Pusi i Miliqit. After the killing, Kadria hid in the mountainous location according to the plan. The Yugoslav gendarmerie found the body two days later and immediately began a search to find Kadria. After some time in the mountains, Kadria contacted his mother's uncle Ram√´ Vuthi to assist him with crossing into Albania. Ram√´ Vuthi was to provide him with a horse and supplies, but he betrayed Kadria and mortally wounded and surrendered him to the gendarmerie. The officers wanted to interrogate him in order to find if his actions were part of a larger plan. Kadria, however, bled out and died by the time they arrived in the Serbian Orthodox churchyard of Istok.  Aftermath and legacy  Some time later, the cousins of Kadria, Bardh Hasanaj (14 years old at the time of the revenge killing) and Hasan Zeq√´ Hasanaj took revenge and killed Ram√´ Vuthi. They were jailed for their actions. Ram√´ Vuthi was buried without a funeral because the village imam refused to attend the ceremony. Numerous folk songs have been composed for the actions of Selman Kadria. One the better known ones is \\"K√´ng√´ p√´r Selman Kadriun\\". It is usually accompanied by √áifteli and sharki.The tomb of Kadria has become a local monument over the years. It has been vandalized twice, allegedly by Serb nationalists. In June 2019, Bek√´ Berisha, a representative in the Kosovan parliament, proposed to Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj that Kadria should be named Hero of Kosovo. Haradinaj accepted the proposition and began the nomination process for the decoration.

Estimates about the time of its composition range from between 1931 and 1932 and 1932 alone. The piece was extensively revised in 1939. Performed in its entirety, it lasts for 18 minutes.  Background  The Sextet was composed at the height of Poulenc's Les Six years. It was written around the same time as the cantata Le Bal Masqu√© and the Concerto for Two Pianos. Poulenc did not always find composing to be a quick process, and this work is an example of a time in which that was the case.  Structure and analysis  The piece is divided into three sections: *I. Allegro vivace *II. Divertissement: Andantino *III. Finale: Prestissimo The first movement begins with upward scales by all instruments, before transferring into an energetic beginning section with complex rhythms, jazz undertones, and an underlying line from the pianist. In the middle of the movement is a slower section led in by a bassoon melody which is then repeated by the other instruments. The original tempo returns at the end of the movement. Florent Schmitt gave the piece's premiere a negative review. The second movement is in a \\"slow-fast- slow\\" form. It has been seen as influenced by Classical period music and divertimentos as well as a parody of Mozart's slow movements. It uses a variety of textures in the woodwinds which are accompanied by piano. Orrin Howard of the Los Angeles Philharmonic viewed the fast interlude as a form of musical comic relief. The finale begins with \\"an Offenbachian gallop\\" and is in rondo form. It has jazz and ragtime influences and has been interpreted as a satirical depiction of neoclassicism in music. The finale repeats themes from the previous two movements and ends with a lyrical and solemn coda with influences from Maurice Ravel.  Performance history and revision  The piece was premiered in 1933 with Poulenc himself playing the piano part and Marcel Moyse, Roland Lamorlette, Louis Cahuzac, Gustave Dh√©rin, and R. Blot on flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and horn, respectively. The piece was not well received by traditionalists in the music community, with composer and critic Florent Schmitt of Le Temps criticizing it as wandering and vulgar. A more positive review came from Andr√© George of Les Nouvelles litt√©raires, who wrote that \\"with Poulenc, all of France comes out of the windows he opens.\\" In the composer‚Äôs later life, he performed the piece with the Philadelphia Woodwind Quintet, composed of members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, including John de Lancie. On March 17, 1960, Poulenc entered the rehearsal in normal attire before changing into slippers which he was keeping in his case. Poulenc extensively revised the composition in August 1939 because he was dissatisfied with the original work.* He told composer and conductor Nadia Boulanger, \\"There were some good ideas in [the original] but the whole thing was badly put together. With the proportions altered, better balanced, it comes over very clearly.\\"  References   Bibliography  * Category:1932 compositions Category:1939 compositions Category:Compositions for wind quintet Category:Compositions for piano sextet Category:Compositions by Francis Poulenc ","title":"Sextet (Poulenc)"},{"id":"49368898","text":"Arnolds Mazitis (; 18 July 191315 September 2002) was a Latvian artist and a graduate of the Latvian Academy of Arts in Riga.

Socially, politically and culturally, this was a turbulent period in Latvia's history.Plakans, Andrejs (2011). A Concise History of the Baltic States, Cambridge University Press. The Soviet Union first imposed its demand for military bases on the three independent Baltic nation states in 1939. It then invaded the three Baltics States, including Latvia, in 1940 and in 1941, the German army invaded Latvia. The Soviet Union then re-occupied Latvia in 1944.Buttar, Prit (2015). Between Giants: The Battle for the Baltics in World War II (General Military), Osprey Publishing. Mazitis was mobilised by the German Army in 1944, just before the Soviet Army's advance later that year. Because of his academic training, he became an official war artist for the German Army, along with other Latvian artists, such as G. Matvejevs (1910-1966) and J. Soikans (1920-1995). After the defeat of the German Army, Mazitis sought refuge in L√ºbeck, Germany, then in Malm√∂, Sweden, in 1946, and then in Meerbeck, Germany. Professor ValdemƒÅrs Tone ‚Äì also a refugee ‚Äì joined Mazitis in Meerbeck in 1946, where, with Erasts ≈†veics (1895-1992), they were allowed a small studio above a postal office in the Meerbeck displaced persons camp. Although they were short of materials, they managed to paint, exhibiting in Oldenburg in 1946 and in Bad Oeynhausen in 1948.Latvian Arts and Crafts (1948). Bad Oeyenhausen Latvian Arts Festival Catalogue, p.1. =Life in England= In 1947, his wife, Aina Jansone (1913-1999), went to England with their children to find a place to live and work. Mazitis joined his wife in England in 1949. England accepted refugees from the Baltic States on condition they work a minimum of three years as manual labourers in factories, workshops, hospitals, mines and farms.Grinberga, Laura (2002). Gleznotajs Arnolds Mazitis Thesis, Latvian Academy of Culture. P.20. On his arrival in England, Mazitis started to establish himself in the artistic life of his new home country. In 1950, a portrait of his oldest daughter Ieva, Girl with a Beret, was accepted at the Royal Academy of Arts for its summer exhibition and the portrait was shown in London as well as in Brighton.The Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts MCML Catalogue, W.M.Clowes,(1950) p.52 He joined Smiths Industries in 1954 as a freehand designer, working on speedometers for Rolls Royce and Jaguar cars.Grinberga, Laura (2002). Gleznotajs Arnolds Mazitis Thesis, Latvian Academy of Culture. p.21-22.

In 1973, at the age of 61, Mazitis retired from Smiths Industries to devote the rest of his life to his art.Grinberga, Laura (2002). Gleznotajs Arnolds Mazitis Thesis, Latvian Academy of Culture. p.23. He continued to exhibit new works throughout the 1970s and 1980s and in the 1990s. The Schwartz Sackin and Co. gallery and the Bruton Street Gallery were active sellers of his works. His last public exhibition was in the Haste Gallery in Ipswich in 2000. In 1993 he was awarded the title of Honorary Professor of the Latvian Academy of Arts. Mazitis died in September 2002. Private life In 1938 Mazitis married Aina Jansone (1913-1999), a reader for one of the main Latvian publishing houses, . Their winter wedding inspired a scene in Anslavs Eglitis's (1906-1993) first novel Bride Hunters (Ligava Mednieki, 1954).Anslavs Eglitis, Ligava Mednieki, Daugava, 1954. They were both closely involved in the artistic and literary world of 1930s Latvia. The author Anslavs Eglitis, lived in a neighbouring apartment (#17) at 21 Thomson Street, Riga, and was a fellow artist and a regular chess partner. Jansone was closely involved in the literary life of pre-war Latvia and Mazitis was active in the art world. They had two daughters, Ieva, born in 1943 and, Anna, in 1946. Jansone divorced Mazitis in 1953. In 1955, he married Gaida Trezina (1919-2014), a mezzo-soprano opera soloist and music teacher, from Cesis, Latvia.Grinberga, Laura (2002). Gleznotajs Arnolds Mazitis Thesis, Latvian Academy of Culture. Works In his portraits, still life, and landscapes, the artist's sensory world is expressed through form, colour and texture.

There are currently 13 classified members belonging to the CCT family. A representative list of these proteins is available in the Transporter Classification Database. Homologues are found in a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Clostridium difficile cytotoxins Clostridium difficile, the causative agent of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, possesses two main virulence factors: the large clostridial cytotoxins A (TcdA; TC# 1.C.57.1.2) and B (TcdB, TC# 1.C.57.1.1). Action by large clostridial toxins (LCTs) from Clostridium difficile includes four steps: (1) receptor-mediated endocytosis, (2) translocation of a catalytic glucosyltransferase domain across the membrane, (3) release of the enzymatic part by auto-proteolysis, and (4) inactivation of Rho family proteins. Cleavage of toxin B and all other large clostridial cytotoxins, is an autocatalytic process dependent on host cytosolic inositolphosphate cofactors. A covalent inhibitor of aspartate proteases, 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane or EPNP, completely blocks toxin B function on cultured cells and has been used to identify the catalytically active protease site. The toxin uses eukaryotic signals for induced autoproteolysis to deliver its toxic domain into the cytosol of target cells. Reineke et al. (2007) present an integrated model for the uptake and inositolphosphate-induced activation of toxin B. Clostridium difficile infection, caused by the actions of the homologous toxins TcdA and TcdB on colonic epithelial cells is due to binding to target cells which triggers toxin internalization into acidified vesicles, whereupon cryptic segments from within the 1,050-aa translocation domain unfurl and insert into the bounding membrane, creating a transmembrane passageway to the cytosol. Sensitive residues-clustered between amino acyl residues 1,035 and 1,107, when individually mutated, reduced cellular toxicity by >1,000-fold. Defective variants exhibit impaired pore formation in planar lipid bilayers and biological membranes, resulting in an inability to intoxicate cells through either apoptotic or necrotic pathways. The findings suggest similarities between the pore-forming 'hotspots' of TcdB and the diphtheria toxin translocation domain.  Function  Proteolytically processed clostridial cytotoxins A (306 kDa; TC# 1.C.57.1.2) and B (269 kDa; TC# 1.C.57.1.1) are O-glycosyltransferases that modify small GTPases of the Rho family by glucosylation of threonine residues, thereby blocking the action of the GTPases as switches of signal processes such as those mediated by the actin cytoskeleton. The toxins thus induce redistribution of actin filaments and cause the cells to round up. The catalytic domains of CCTs probably enter the cytoplasm from acidic endosomes. The toxins form ion-permeable channels in cell membranes and artificial bilayers when exposed to acidic pH. pH-dependent channel formation has been demonstrated for C. difficile Toxin B and C as well as Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL). Low pH presumably induces conformational/structural changes that promote membrane insertion and channel formation.  Structure  Cytotoxins of the CCT family are large (e.g., toxin B of C. difficile is 2366 aas long) and tripartite with the N-terminal domain being the catalytic unit, the C-terminal domain being the cellular receptor and the central hydrophobic domain being the channel-former. In this respect, they superficially resemble diphtheria toxin (DT; TC# 1.C.7) although no significant sequence similarity between CCTs and DT is observed. The E. coli toxin B protein (TC# 1.C.57.2.1) and the Chlamydial TC0437 protein (TC# 1.C.57.2.2) are of 3169 aas and 3255 aas, respectively. The distantly related ToxA toxin of Pasteurella multocida (TC# 1.C.57.3.1) is 1285 aas while the E. coli Cnf1 and 2 toxins(TC#s 1.C.57.3.2 and 1.C.57.3.3, respectively) are 1014 aas, and the RTX cytotoxin of Vibrio vulnificus (TC# 1.C.57.3.4) is 5206 aas.

Its objectives were the use of recently captured Salavan as a jumpoff point for occupying Tha Theng and Ban Phong. Key to the plan was a prearranged daily allotment of supportive tactical air power. In the event, the Royalists captured their two objectives. However, they lost both Salavan and Paksong to the North Vietnamese; they also failed to find the Communist transshipment point whose conquest would have interdicted the Trail. Overview The Ho Chi Minh Trail was central to the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) strategy for the conquest of South Vietnam during the Second Indochina War. When a series of nine CIA-sponsored incursions from Military Region 3 (MR 3) and Military Region 4 (MR 4) of the southern panhandle of the Kingdom of Laos during 1969 and 1970 failed to interdict the Trail, the massive Operation Lam Son 719 was staged on 8 February 1971 to cut it. In the wake of this failure, CIA backed Laotian guerrillas and Royal Lao Government military irregulars made further attempts at severing the logistical lines of communication.Nalty, pp. 5‚Äì7; 149‚Äì154.Castle, pp. 108‚Äì109.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 217‚Äì224, 268‚Äì272, 276‚Äì284, 289‚Äì291 A string of Communist transshipment points, called Binh Trams, stretched the length of the Trail. Each garrisoned by approximately a PAVN regiment, and was responsible for construction and maintenance of an assigned Trail segment. A Binh Tram typically consisted of motor transport battalions, combat engineer battalions, antiaircraft units, as well as medical personnel, infantry units for security, and a communications section.Conboy, Morrison, p. 312 note 83. Background In mid-May 1971, Operation Phoutah failed to secure the forward airfield at Moung Phalane as a starting point for Royalist attacks against the Trail.Conboy, Morrison, pp 289‚Äì292. The three-day blood bath of Operation Phiboonpol from 9‚Äì11 June 1971 was indecisive.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 287‚Äì288. From 28 July through 31 October 1971, Operation Sayasila managed to wrest control of Route 23 and the towns of Salavan and Paksong and their associated airstrips from the (PAVN), but failed to conquer the entire Bolaven Plateau.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 304‚Äì307. Also, from 1‚Äì9 November, Operation Bedrock weakened the PAVN troops on the Trail by denying them rice. It also left Groupement Mobile 41 (GM 41) field tested and ready for further operations.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 304‚Äì308. Operation Thao La Operation Thao La was planned to take advantage of improved flying weather during the nascent dry season in Laos. Its objective was Binh Tram 37, 30 kilometers east of Communist-held Thateng, Laos. U.S. Air Force (USAF) tactical air power was arranged, with 18 daily sorties allotted for the first two days, then 24 sorties daily for a fortnight. The dark hours would be covered by two gunship sorties per night. If Thao La was successful in smashing Binh Tram 37, it would both restrict supplies to Communist forces in South Vietnam and starve the Communists off the Bolaven Plateau.Conboy, Morrison, p. 308. Like the preceding Operation Sayasila, Operation Thao La was aimed at regaining control of the Plateau for the Royal Lao Government (RLG). The towns of Thateng and Ban Phone were to be captured from the PAVN in a three column multi-battalion offensive.Hukle, et al, p. 22 As a preliminary move, the gains of Operation Sayasila needed to be protected. On 8 November, Bataillon Infanterie 9 (BI 9) joined Bataillon Volontaire 46 (BV 46) and Bataillon Volontaire 48 (BV 48) in garrisoning Paksong. Four battalions from MR 3 returned to their base at Savannakhet.Hukle, et al, p. 31. Because of the American restrictions on Lao military planning, approval by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff did not come through until 15 November.Anthony, Sexton, p. 353. On 16 November, just prior to Thao La's scheduled start, a purported four battalion force of PAVN were reported by Royalist guerrillas, 19 kilometers northwest of Salavan. Tactical air strikes on the concentration resulted in about 70 enemy troops killed.Hukle, et al, p. 28. On 20 November 1971, the operation was preceded by ten sorties of defensive land mines air-dropped by the U.S. Air Force. Commando Raiders occupied a helicopter landing zone (HLZ) north of Ban Phone. On 21 November, USAF F-4 Phantom IIs struck the HLZ, and the 1,150 Royalist guerrillas of the Groupement Mobile 33 (GM 33) regiment was lifted in unopposed from Salavan. By 1100 hours, it had secured the area with only minor opposition, and all four of its battalions encamped within two kilometers of the village.Hukle, et al, pp. 23‚Äì25. Also on 21 November, three battalions of GM 41 swept south through the rice paddies outside of Salavan. With no appreciable resistance offered by the PAVN, the GM 41 column made it to Ban Nongnok, where they overran the 49th PAVN Field Hospital on the 23rd. At this time, USAF tactical air blasted an HLZ atop Phou Thioum. Although about 50 PAVN troops tried to defend the hilltop, USAF A-1 Skyraider strikes quelled them. After capturing the position, the fourth Royalist battalion of GM 41 established a fire base with a 75mm pack howitzer, three 75mm recoilless rifles, and three 81mm mortars. The Royalists could now drop artillery shells anywhere in the vicinity of Ban Nongnok.Hukle, et al, p. 23. By 25 November, all Royalist objectives had been secured except Tha Theng proper. The following day saw the Royalist reserve of two guerrilla battalions moved north from Lima Site 449 (LS 449) to reinforce the move into Tha Theng; by afternoon, the three year occupation by the Communists had been ended.Hukle, et al, p. 25. On 28 November, GM 33 began clearing Route 16 and its surrounding valley as it handed westward to link up with the Royalist troops in Tha Theng. It covered half the distance in the next two days, while meeting ever-increasing Communist resistance. On 1 December, it captured four trucks. Stretching into battalion line, the irregular regiment swept for PAVN rice caches and supply depots to deprive the Communists of materiel. Westward moving partisans began to struggle with trees downed to block Route 16. In the meantime, PAVN began a series of squad-sized attacks on Tha Theng.Hukle, et al, p. 26. Meanwhile, at Paksong, the 9th PAVN Regiment had probed the Royalist defenses 21 times during November.Hukle, et al, p. 31. On 3 December at Tha Theng, a PAVN battalion attacked an irregular battalion. Meanwhile, intelligence reports made it clear that PAVN forces were coalescing near the former Communist transshipment point. As a counter, the USAF honored an emergency request and dropped aerial denial ordnance along two projected approach lanes to Tha Theng. The USAF also consented to extending the supply of 24 sorties of daily tactical air power for Thao La through 27 December 1971.Hukle, et al, pp. 26‚Äì27. At 2200 hours 5 December, PAVN intruders began probing the Royalist positions at Salavan. Night long close air support by a Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) AC-47 gunship helped the Royalist Bataillon Volontaires 41 (BV 41) hold until near dawn. At 0500 hours, a PAVN force of at least three battalions struck Salavan. Raven Forward Air Controllers directed 60 sorties of tactical air strikes upon them throughout the morning and early afternoon. However, at 1430 hours, the Royalist commander called retreat; the monarchist regulars scattered west and north, leaving Salavan to the Communists, and further isolating the Royalist irregular troops at Tha Theng and Ban Phong.Hukle, et al, p. 29. Even as Thao La unfolded, the PAVN continued their own offensive operations. By the end of the first week in December, Raven FACs noticed freshly built PAVN bunkers within 50 meters of Paksong's defenses. A skirmish on 8 December resulted in two Royalist killed and ten claimed PAVN dead. Air strikes called by the Royalists are estimated to have killed 20 more PAVN soldiers. At 2000 hours on 9 December, four tanks and two PAVN infantry battalions struck GM 41 at Tha Theng. Striking from the north, they split in half to form two attacking columns. One of the tanks penetrated the Tha Theng perimeter, locked one tread, and spun on the other while firing in all directions, dispersing two of the Royalist guerrilla battalions. The two remaining RLG battalions clung to Tha Theng until reinforced. At 0430 on the 10th, the PAVN armor retreated. The Royalists had suffered 20 killed and 23 wounded, in return for unknown enemy losses. Raven FACs directed close air support sorties on the Communists for the remainder of the day. It also requested mining sorties along Route 23, to block or destroy PAVN tanks inbound to Salavan.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 308‚Äì309.Hukle, et al, p. 27. Meanwhile, the PAVN still were trying to take Paksong. Between 10 and 12 December, there were several engagements, ranging from skirmishes between small units up to company engagements of several hours. At its fiercest, the battle escalated to use of B-40 rockets, DK-82 recoilless rifles, and 60mm mortars by the PAVN. In return, the Royalists called in RLAF T-28 Trojan strikes, AC-47 gunship fire missions, and artillery fire. On 13 December, the outpost of irregulars on Phou Nongkin relocated to the two peaks of Phou Thevada lying three kilometers east of Paksong. On 14 December, four battalions of Royalist guerrillas ambushed the PAVN as they gathered north of the town. Two days later, the same guerrilla force was hit by both 60mm and 82mm mortar fire backed by a ground assault from three sides. The guerrillas scattered in retreat.Hukle, p. 32. Presented with the dilemma of which objective was most valuable to their cause, the RLG opted on attempting to retake Salavan while holding Tha Theng. GM 33 was approaching Tha Theng from the east as it moved along Route 16. Leaving a small partisan garrison at Tha Theng, the RLG elected to move its four irregular battalions north for a surprise counterattack on Salavan. Beginning 8 December, troops that had withdrawn from Salavan began to rendezvous 32 kilometers west of town. They were mustered, re-equipped, and resupplied to attack northwards towards Salavan on 15 December. A USAF mission dropped both defensive area denial munitions and land mines under direction of Raven FACs. On 16 December, the four irregular battalions left Tha Theng to assault Salavan. Operation Thao La was officially ended.Conboy, Morrison, p. 309.Hukle, et al, pp. 28‚Äì30. Aftermath The official end of Operation Thao La did not terminate Royalist military action. The recouped guerrillas from Tha Theng had closed to seven kilometers south-southeast of Salavan on 20 December. Two regular Royalist units, Bataillon Volontaires 41 (BV 41) and Bataillon Volontaires 46 (BV 46), were ordered into a flanking attack from the west, although they never budged. The Tha Theng irregulars directed tactical air strikes on the PAVN on 22 and 23 December despite poor flying weather; they followed up with a ground assault. An estimated 250 PAVN were killed in this action, but Salavan remained in Communist hands. The MR 4 command then decided that Salavan could not be held by the RLG even if recaptured. On 24 December, the four battalions of irregulars from Tha Theng joined BV 41 and BV 46 in a retreat from Salavan.Hukle, et al, p. 30. Nor did the PAVN action end coincide with Operation Thao La's finish. Even as a purported 1,000 PAVN troops bombarded forward positions at Paksong with mortar fire, making them difficult to reinforce and resupply, they also angled to cut Route 23 to entrap the Royalists. There was little retaliatory air power available; most tactical air power was being used against Salavan or on the Plain of Jars. On the evening of 18 December, headlights were spotted outside Paksong. On the 19th, tank tread marks were spotted 14 kilometers north of town; at least three tanks were suspected. By 24 December, PAVN troops were spotted on Route 23 between Paksong and the Royalist home base of Pakse. During the next two days, a number of PAVN heavy machine guns moved in on Paksong, complicating Royalist- backed aerial traffic. The bombardment of the town's northern defenses increased.Hukle, et al, pp. 32‚Äì33. On 27 December 1971, two PAVN battalions closed in on Paksong. The two guerrilla battalions on Phou Thevada withdrew into the town. The guerrillas from north of town rushed in after taking 11 killed. Although the Royalist defenders outnumbered the attacking Vietnamese, they fled westward anyhow down Route 23 toward home. Four howitzers, five trucks, and smaller equipment were abandoned to the victors.Hukle, et al, p. 34. On 28 December, the PAVN entered Paksong and torched it. That evening, a tactical air strike destroyed the abandoned howitzers and trucks. Results Operation Thao La gained its two objectives of Tha Theng and Ban Phong by its official end on 16 December. However, it lost its offensive's launching point at Salavan in the process. It also failed to break the PAVN's grip on the eastern Bolavan Plateau where it overwatched the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Although the Royalists had gained their objectives at Tha Theng and Ban Phon, they also lost Salavan and Paksong.Hukle, et al, pp. 25‚Äì29. The RLG casualty list totaled 2,118‚Äî399 killed, 1,376 wounded, and 343 missing. GM 41 was especially hard hit. On the other side, PAVN casualties were deemed to be 653 killed by air, 551 killed in ground combat, and 763 wounded, totaling 1,967 dead or wounded.Hukle, et al, p. 36.

He also previously served as a trustee on the Garden Grove Unified School District Board of Education. Early life and education Nguyen was born in a United Nations refugee camp in Thailand to parents escaping Vietnam, and arrived in the United States when he was 3 months old. He attended school within the Garden Grove Unified School District. He attended Garden Grove High School, and graduated from Pacifica High School. Nguyen graduated from UC Irvine with a bachelor's degree in political science. As an undergraduate, he interned for the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in Rockville, Maryland. Nguyen also earned a master's degree in Indo-Tibetan Buddhist studies from Naropa University. Political career Nguyen was appointed to the Garden Grove Unified School District Board of Education in 2011, after a close race in 2010. He was elected as a trustee in 2012, and served a term as vice president. As a board member, he fought against the exclusion of LGBT Vietnamese from the annual Little Saigon T·∫øt Parade. He resigned from the Board of Trustees in 2014 due to becoming mayor. Nguyen defeated incumbent Bruce Broadwater by 15 votes in the 2014 election to become mayor of Garden Grove. He also became the first Vietnamese-American mayor of the city. As mayor, he sought to improve government transparency and accountability, and to engage voters by making city finance records available online. Nguyen was appointed by the state governor to the Orange County Fair and Event Center Board of Directors. He resigned the position in 2015. The president of the Garden Grove Police Association, a political opponent of Nguyen, \\"surreptitiously recorded a conversation\\" in June 2015 with Nguyen, then newly elected mayor. According to the OC Weekly, \\"during the discussion, Nguyen called [Garden Grove] City Councilman Phat Bui 'a fucking dick,' a reference to efforts by Bui's supporters to label Nguyen a communist sympathizer for not vehemently protesting Riverside's sister-city relationship with Can Tho, Vietnam\\". Nguyen stated the insinuation was inaccurate and that he simply \\"didn't think one city council should tell another what to do\\". In the 2016 elections Nguyen ran for congress in California's 46th district, long held by Loretta Sanchez, with former California State Senate member Lou Correa as his opponent. In the June primary Nguyen came in second with 14.6% of the vote after Correa received 43.7%. In the November Nguyen lost to Correa after receiving just under 30% of the vote in the general election. Nguyen's term as Garden Grove mayor ended in December 2016, and he was succeeded by council member/Mayor Pro Tem, Steve Jones. Personal life In July 2015, Nguyen came out as gay.

It is located within the Weedon Island Preserve, in the northern portion of the city of St. Petersburg, on the western coast of Old Tampa Bay. Weedon Island is archaeologically significant as it serves as a type-site for the Weeden Island Culture. Weedon Island is named for its early owner Dr. Leslie Weedon. History = Early years = Former confederate soldier Captain W. B. Henderson purchased the land that was to become Weedon Island in 1886 with war bonds. When Captain Henderson's daughter Blanche married Dr. Leslie Weedon in 1898, the Captain gave the new couple the Island as a wedding present. Weedon Island was only an island in high tide and during low tide it was connected to the peninsula. Leslie Weedon and his family spent the weekends here from nearby Tampa. At that time there was no bridges across Tampa Bay so they traveled here with their belongings by boat and brought everything back home for the week days. Another family had lived here, The Benjamins who lived on nearby Benjamin Island. Henry R. Benjamin bought Benjamin Island for $1,000 (worth $23,000 in 2016) from Captain W. B. Henderson on April 30, 1878. He kept the land for two years and sold it to his son George M. Benjamin. = Archaeology = In 1923‚Äì24 the island was visited by a Florida archaeologist, Dr. Leslie Weedon preserved Indian mounds here and hoped that they would one day be a place of public heritage. During the winter of 1923‚Äì24 Prof. J. Walter Fewkes the chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology directed excavations of the mounds here. He had concluded there were two waves of migration, the first one of unknown origin and the second one was thought to be from Georgia because the mounds there were very similar. The name for the Weeden Island Culture comes from the island itself. = Development = In 1934, Florida land boom developer Eugene M. Elliot wanted to make the residential community but failed. The San Reno Club did manage to get built by one of his associates, Fred Blair, opening the Sky Harbor Airport (by the 1930s it was known as Grand Central Airport) in 1926. The airport was served by Pitcairn a predecessor of Eastern Air Lines taking passengers to places such as Miami, New York City and Washington, D.C. until the 1930s. On January 27, 1913 the Eastern Air Transport (Eastern Airlines) moved its headquarters here, making it a very busy airport. On February 4, 1927 a man on a motorcycle had reported flames coming out of the island. The next morning an investigation was started and found one dead body and a blood-stained ax. This soon started many different trials and the victim that had died in the shed was identified as George W. Dash, a printer. The man accused of murdering the man and burning down the shed was William Cole. Cole was tried and convicted of murder and pleaded and was freed two years later. He also spent approximately six months in the Pinellas County Jail. = Film = The Weedon Island soon became a popular place for many Hollywood celebrities. In the 1930s the San Reno Club was made into a movie studio which soon burned down and a new one built nearby. In 1933 Sun Haven Studios made three movies Chloe, Playthings of Desire and Hired Wife here. Many performers included: Buster Keaton, Olive Borden, Greta Nissen, James Kirkwood with locals being extras. = National Park Proposal = In the mid 1930s a proposal was to make the island a National park by Pinellas County and St. Petersburg and a committee was formed and sent to Washington, D.C. to meet with the head of the National Park Service at the time, Arno B. Cammerer. The committee had planned that the National Park Service would recognize it as de Soto's official landing site. In 1937, John R. Swanton, an ethnologist and chairman from Harvard University who went on to be part of the Smithsonian Institution's De Soto Commission, decided to research the locations of de Soto's landing site. The exact location was not determined but it was thought to have been at the Little Manatee River. The island did not get the monument and did not become a protected reserve. The landing site of de Soto is still debated today. = World War II = During World War II, the island's airport was converted into a military base due to a surge in aircraft demand. = Decline and later years = The demand during World War II for commercial flights was declining and another contributing factor was that the bridge burned down in 1953. In 1965 and 1970, two teenagers were killed in a car accident on the bridge. The airport soon became vandalized and completely destroyed. In 1955, the Florida Power Corporation (Progress Energy) bought most of the northern end of the island to build a power plant. In 1960, a temporary salt water conversion plant was built here by Progress Energy, Cornell University and the federal government which operated for four years and made 35,000‚Äì50,000 gallons of fresh water a day. In 1970 the Greek Oil Tanker Dellan Apollon almost ran aground while trying to dock at the power plant on the island. By the early 1970s the last commercial land owners had sold the land, showing there was no future for commercial development and only the energy facility was left alone and the rest of the island was converted to a nature preserve. On March 25, 2000 on a clear day a helicopter was returning form St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa and hit a radio tower guy wire and crashed into the mangroves on the island with all three people on board. Today, the island is a preserve.

The company develops software for gesture control and body tracking based on 3D depth data. , Gestigon is developing augmented reality and automotive solutions for Audi, Renault and Volkswagen. The company is also working on AR/VR headsets as well as consumer electronics and smart home devices. In March 2017, Gestigon was acquired by Valeo, a French automotive supplier. History Sascha Klement worked as a student assistant and Ph.D. student for the professors Thomas Martinetz and Erhardt Barth, who have been developing software solutions based on time-of-flight sensors at the University of L√ºbeck since 2002. Together they founded gestigon in 2011 with seed-funding from High-Tech Gr√ºnderfonds, Mittelst√§ndische Beteiligungsgesellschaft Schleswig- Holstein and local business angels. In March 2012 Moritz von Grotthuss joined the company as advisor and later became CEO, being considered a late-founder. The same month, gestigon received an Innovation Award at CeBIT 2012, being one of the 15 startups to receive an award out of 276 candidates. In January 2013, Gestigon participated at CES in Las Vegas and, later that year, also at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York City. The next year Visteon and Volkswagen used Gestigon's gestures solutions in their products presented at CES 2014 and CeBIT 2014 where it won the ‚ÄúCeBIT Innovation Award‚Äù. Further public displays of gestigon's technologies include Audi at CES 2015 and CES 2016; Volkswagen and Infineon. Gestigon launched its Virtual Reality solution Carnival at the TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco in September 2015 using an Oculus Rift and different depth sensors. The first demo using a mobile device was done at the CES 2015. Gestigon has partnered with several companies that develop hardware solutions, especially depth sensors, to provide sensing solutions. In 2015 Gestigon partnered with Inuitive, a 3D computer vision and image processors developer, to create a VR unit. The system was presented at CES 2016 assembled on an Oculus Rift development kit. In July 2015, Gestigon closed its Series A financing round with nbr technology ventures GmbH as a primary investor headed by Fabian von Kuenheim. In this financing round the company received additional investments from High-Tech Gr√ºnderfonds and Vorwerk Direct Selling Ventures. In March 2017, Gestigon developed software that recognizes driving gestures. Products Gestigon develops software that works with 3D sensors to recognize human gestures, poses and biometrical features in real time. Gecko is a feature tracker developed by the company that tracks an individual measuring their biometric features. Flamenco is a software for Finger and Hand Gesture Control. Gestigon has developed Carnival SDK, a software for augmented reality and virtual reality, which allows users see and use their hands in virtual interfaces. Gestigon's solutions are based on skeleton recognition: the software recognizes the body parts in 3D data making the recognition faster and more accurate. The software is sensor agnostic and can work based on the data from any depth module using time-of-flight-, stereo- or structured light technologies.

He explained that the original demo lyrics were \\"bogus\\" and did not have any \\"bite\\", but following the 2014 suicide of Selim Lemouchi, guitarist of the Dutch rock band the Devil's Blood who was friends with members of Ghost, the lyrics materialized. Ghost performed an acoustic version of \\"He Is\\" at the Bandit Rock Awards on January 19, 2016 at the Hard Rock Cafe in Stockholm. A 10\\" picture disc vinyl single of a live recording of \\"He Is\\", that was limited to 500 copies, was released in 2017. Its content was also made available digitally on iTunes. Videos A lyric video for the song was made by Mattias Erik Johansson/Claudio Marino/Nicklas Lindahl. It was uploaded to the band's official YouTube channel on November 9, 2015. On August 24, 2017, Ghost uploaded the final music video from Meliora for \\"He Is\\". It was directed by Zev Deans and premiered at Saint Vitus Bar in New York City the day before. An extended director's cut of the video was released exclusively in collaboration with Metal Injection. Reception Upon Melioras release, \\"He Is\\" was quickly cited as a stand out track and became a fan favorite at concerts. PopMatterss Nathan Stevens wrote that it \\"could be mistaken for a worship song in a mega-church and that's not a demerit against the track. The chorus is massive and begs for a sing along.\\" Sputnikmusic wrote that the track \\"showcases Ghost's keen attention to integrating doom- infused, progressive elements with glistening, pop-oriented sensibilities.\\" They praised the harmonized guitars as \\"marvelous\\" and the \\"ethereal\\" vocals. In an interview with one of the guitarists, Joe Bosso of MusicRadar cited the guitar solo as the musician's best. The Nameless Ghoul then explained the solo is not a tapping one, but a \\"tapping-like technique\\" and that it is one of many parts of the song that is exactly as it was on the demo. In Rolling Stones readers' poll of The 10 Best Songs of 2015, \\"He Is\\" was ranked fourth. Brittany Spanos wrote that with the song Ghost \\"hit a psychedelic note, going back to metal's folkier roots from the Sixties and Seventies.\\" Track listing ;2015 Promo single ;2017 10\\" Vinyl single Personnel * Papa Emeritus III ‚àí vocals * Nameless Ghouls ‚Äì all instrumentalists: lead guitarist 20px, bassist 20px, keyboardist 20px, drummer 20px, rhythm guitarist 20px References External links  Category:2015 singles Category:2007 songs Category:Ghost (Swedish band) songs Category:Songs written by Tobias Forge Category:Songs written by Klas √Öhlund ","title":"He Is (Ghost song)"},{"id":"49369746","text":"Delage was a French automobile manufacturer Delage or Del√¢ge may also refer to: People * Cyrille-Fraser Del√¢ge (1869‚Äì1957), Quebec politician * Guy Delage, French swimmer who claimed to have crossed the Atlantic solo * Louis Del√¢ge (1874‚Äì1947), French automobile engineer and manufacturer * Maurice Delage (1879‚Äì1961) French composer and pianist * Micka√´l Delage (b. 1985), French professional cyclist * Pierre Delage (1887‚Äì1918), French aviator * Yves Delage (1854‚Äì1920), French zoologist Other uses * Delage (band), a British girl pop group in the 1990s * Lac-Delage, Quebec, a town and lake in Canada * Nieuport-Delage, a French aeroplane manufacturing company See also * Delarge (disambiguation) ","title":"Delage (disambiguation)"},{"id":"49369749","text":"Delarge is a French surname and may refer to: * Dzon Delarge (b.1990), a Congolese footballer * Fernand Delarge (b.1904), a Belgian boxer * Jean Delarge (1906-1977), a Belgian professional boxer * Alex DeLarge, a fictional character in Anthony Burgess' novel A Clockwork Orange * thirtytwo Delarge a Greek beatmaker/producer See also * Robert C.

Territorial claims in the South China Sea The article covers events that are related to the South China Sea dispute.  Timeline of events  = 1000 BCE‚Äì2nd century CE= The Sa Hu·ª≥nh culture flourished in coastal South China Sea, especially in southern to central Vietnam, from Mekong Delta to Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh province. The people that support Sa Hu·ª≥nh civilization were sea faring Austronesian-speaking people. The Sa Hu·ª≥nh relics can be found in several sites on the coasts of South China Sea, from Palawan in the Philippines to Orchid Island near Taiwan, suggesting that they sailed, settled and traded around the coasts of South China Sea. = 3rd century BCE = It has been claimed by the People's Republic of China on the argument that since 200 BCE Chinese fishermen have used the Spratly islands. = 3rd century = Two famous Chinese books authored by Wan Zhen of the Eastern Wu State and published during the Three Kingdoms period (220‚Äì280 CE) and a work titled Guangzhou Ji (Chronicles of Guangzhou) authored by Pei Yuan of the Jin dynasties described the Paracel and Spratly islands. The local government of the Jin dynasties exercised jurisdiction over the islands by sending patrolling naval boats to the surrounding sea areas. = 5th‚Äì13th centuries = Naval forces of the Song State of the Southern Dynasties (420‚Äì479 CE) patrolled the Paracel and Spratly islands. In the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907 CE), the islands were placed under the administration and authority of the Qiongzhou Perfecture (now Hainan Province). The Chinsese administration of the South China Sea continued into the North and South Song dynasties (970‚Äì1279). Archaeologists have found Chinese made potteries porcelains and other historical relics from the Southern dynasties (420‚Äì589), the Sui dynasties (581‚Äì618), the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907), the Song dynasties (960‚Äì1279), the Yuan dynasties (1206‚Äì1368), the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) and later eras up to modern times on the South China Sea islands. = 6th‚Äì15th centuries = The South China Sea was known as the \\"Osean sea\\" by ShauShau the explorer and traders in the region. It was named after a Hindu thalassocratic empire Champa that flourished in the actual central Vietnam around that period. In 1596, the Spanish Colonial Government declared that each island in the Kalayaan Islands, now known as the Spratly Islands, had Barangay or Barrio status. = 19th century = French soldiers and local townsfolk pose for the camera in front of a temple in Makung in the Pescadores Islands.

In December 1884, alarmed by Japanese ambitions in Korea, Empress Dowager Cixi ordered her ministers to extricate China from the undeclared war with France that had broken out on 23 August. Important French victories in Tonkin and Formosa in February and early March 1885 strengthened her desire to end the Sino-French War, and although the Chinese won an unexpected victory in Tonkin in late March, defeating General de N√©grier's 2nd Brigade at Bang Bo and reoccupying L·∫°ng S∆°n, this success was counterbalanced by the simultaneous French capture of the Pescadores Islands. China's position in early April 1885 was critical. Seizing the opportunity offered by the fall of the Ferry ministry, the Chinese agreed to implement the provisions of the May 1884 Tientsin Accord, which recognised France's protectorate over Vietnam. In return, the French dropped their longstanding demand for an indemnity for the B·∫Øc L·ªá ambush. After a flurry of negotiations in Paris in the first days of April 1885, peace was made on this basis.Thomazi, 258‚Äì62 * 11 May 1884 ‚Äì The Tientsin Accord or Li‚ÄìFournier Convention, concluded on 11 May 1884, was intended to settle an undeclared war between France and China over the sovereignty of Tonkin (northern Vietnam). The convention, negotiated by Li Hung-chang for China and capitaine de vaisseau Fran√ßois-Ernest Fournier for France, provided for a Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin in return for a comprehensive treaty that would settle details of trade and commerce between France and China and provide for the demarcation of its disputed border with Vietnam.Thomazi, La conqu√™te de l'Indochine, 189‚Äì92 * 9 June 1885 ‚Äì The Treaty of Tientsin, signed on 9 June 1885, officially ended the Sino-French War. The unequal treaty restated in greater detail the main provisions of the Tientsin Accord, signed between France and China on 11 May 1884. As Article 2 required China to recognise the French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin established by the Treaty of Hue in June 1884, implicitly abandoning her own claims to suzerainty over Vietnam, the treaty formalised France's victory in the Sino-French War. * 1887 ‚Äì In the 19th century, Europeans found that Chinese fishermen from Hainan annually visited the Spratly islands for part of the year, while in 1877 it was the British who launched the first modern legal claims to the Spratlys.ed.

The 1887 Chinese-Vietnamese Boundary convention signed between France and China after the Sino-French War said that China was the owner of the Spratly and Paracel islands. The 1887 Convention Respecting the Delimitation of the Frontier Between China and Tonkin between France and the Qing Empire set the coastal boundary in the Gulf of Tonkin but did not state that China was the owner of the Spratly and Paracel islands because these islands are not in the Gulf of Tonkin nor was administered by Tonkin but belonged to the realm of Annam in Central Vietnam. The purpose of this treaty was for a better control of the border by having it follow the Ka Long river in M√≥ng C√°i coastal city, but doing so, the French gave an enclave to China of 7 Vietnamese fishermen's villages.\\"T·∫•m b·∫£n ƒë·ªì ch√≠n g·∫°ch (ch·ªØ U) c·ªßa Trung Qu·ªëc\\" B√°o Ng∆∞·ªùi Vi·ªát Boston Currently there are some suggestions that this part of Fangchenggang district, Guangxi, China belongs to Vietnam, especially after North Vietnam was established and announced to cancel all treaties signed by French colonial Vietnam. Thus Fangchenggang was supposed to be returned to Qu·∫£ng Ninh Province in Vietnam, but this has not been done yet. Most people living in the area are Vietnamese fishermen who became one of the 56 ethnic groups of China, known as ethnic Vietnamese people of China or Gin people. * 1898 ‚Äì The Philippine Islands were ceded by Spain to the United States in the Treaty of Paris following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The Spratly Islands were not part of the Philippines per the Treaty. * 12 April 1898 ‚Äì France seized Guangzhouwan as a treaty port, and took its own concession in the treaty port of Shanghai. Kwangchow Wan, (Guangzhouwan), was leased by China to France for 99 years (or until 1997, as the British did in Hong Kong's New Territories), according to the Treaty of 12 April 1898, on 27 May as Territoire de Kouang-Tch√©ou-Wan, to counter the growing commercial power of British Hong KongA.

Their efforts, however, were hindered by the poverty of the surrounding land. The French retained control of the region until 1943 when the Japanese occupied the area during World War II. At the end of the war, the region returned briefly under French rule before being formally returned to China in 1946 by General Charles de Gaulle, the French head of state.

The local government and many residents escape to Australia. The Spratlys and the Paracels were conquered by Japan in 1939. Japan had set military bases on Woody and Pattle islands in the Paracels and Itu Aba in the Spratlys.

At the same time, the Government and exiles of the Kingdom of Humanity returned to the islands. * 1946 ‚Äì The R.O.C. established garrisons on both Woody (now Yongxing / Ê∞∏ÂÖ¥) Island in the Paracels and Taiping Island in the Spratlys. France protested. The French tried but failed to dislodge Chinese nationalist troops from Yongxing Island/Woody Island (the only habitable island in the Paracels), but were able to establish a small camp on Pattle (now Shanhu / ÁèäÁëö) Island in the southwestern part of the archipelago.ed.

The Republic of China drew up The Southern China Sea Islands Location Map, marking the national boundaries in the sea with 11 lines, two of which were later removed, showing the U shaped claim on the entire South China Sea, and showing the Spratly and Paracels in Chinese territory, in 1947. The Americans reminded the Philippines at its independence in 1946 that the Spratlys was not Philippine territory, both to not anger Chiang Kai-shek in China and because the Spratlys were not part of the Philippines per the 1898 treaty Spain signed with America. * 1950 ‚Äì After the Chinese nationalists were driven from Hainan by the People's Liberation Army (PLA), they withdrew their garrisons in both the Paracels and Spratlys to Taiwan. * 1952 ‚Äì Japan renounced any claims of sovereignty over the Spratly and Paracel archipelagos in accordance with Article 2 Clause (f) of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, but no beneficiary was designated. * 1954 ‚Äì The Geneva Accords, which China was a signatory, settled the First Indochina War end. French Indochina was split into three countries: Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Vietnam was to be temporarily divided along the 17th Parallel. Chapter I, Article 4 say: \\"The provisional military demarcation line between the two final regrouping zones is extended into the territorial waters by a line perpendicular to the general line of the coast. All coastal islands north of this boundary shall be evacuated by the armed forces of the French Union, and all islands south of it shall be evacuated by the forces of the People's Army of Viet-Nam.\\" On 26 October 1955, the Republic of Vietnam \\"South Vietnam\\" replaced the State of Vietnam (part of the French Union) and inherit of its rights. Nothing was said explicitly about offshore archipelagos, which was of small interest by that times, it was clearly understood by all the parties that the Republic of Vietnam inherit of all the French Indochina's Vietnamese territories under the 17th Parallel. As the Paracel and the Spratly archipelagos (which lay below the 17th parallel) were part of the French Indochina since 1933, they were part of \\"South Vietnam\\" territory. The French bestowed its titles, rights, and claims over the two island chains to the Republic of Vietnam. * 1956 ‚Äì North Vietnam Communist government formally accepted that the Paracel and Spratly islands were historically Chinese. But, that same year, South Vietnam reopened the abandoned French camp on Shanhu Island in the Paracels and announced that it had annexed the Paracel archipelago as well as the Spratlys. About the same time, the PLA reestablished a Chinese garrison on Yongxing Island in the Paracels, while the Republic of China (Taipei) put troops back on Taiping Island in the Spratlys.Paracel and Spratly Islands In 1956, Cloma proclaimed the establishment of a new country, \\"Freedomland\\" in the Spratly Islands. The sole function of Freedomland turned out to be issuing postage stamps to collectors. Cloma's announcement of Freedomland caused both Beijing and Taipei to reiterate China's claims to the Spratlys. Taipei sent troops to drive Cloma off Taiping Island. Its forces are still there. Cloma's proclamation of Freedomland was legal in the Philippines because, as Manila noted in its reply to protests of Cloma's actions from Beijing, Saigon, and Taipei, the Philippines had made no claim of its own to the Spratlys. * 16 January 1957 ‚Äì China transferred B·∫°ch Long Vƒ© Island to Vietnam.Official history of Bach Long Vi island * 4 September 1958 ‚Äì China published \\"Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China on China's Territorial Sea published on 4 September 1958\\" to lawfully describe true meaning of \\"nine-dotted line on South China Sea\\". * 14 September 1958 ‚Äì Communist Vietnamese Premier Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng sent Premier Zhou Enlai a formal diplomatic saying respect China's decision on South China Sea. * 1959 ‚Äì The people of the Spratly and Paracel Islands reunite in the Republic of Morac-Songhrati-Meads and vote in a new government. = 1970s = * 1969 ‚Äì A UN sponsored research team discovers oil under the sea floor of the island group. * 1970 ‚Äì China occupies Amphitrite Group of the Paracel Islands * 1971 ‚Äì Philippines announces claim to islands adjacent to its territory in the Spratlys, which they named Kalayaan, which was formally incorporated into Palawan Province in 1972.

In the ensuing naval battle at Shanhu Island, China defeated Vietnamese forces. This enabled Beijing to extend its control to the entire Paracel archipelago, where it has not been effectively challenged since.

However, this caused further skirmishes with Vietnam when, in January 1988, some Vietnamese ships with construction materials tried to approach the reef in a bid to establish structures there.

Fear appeals are commonly used in social marketing campaigns. These are sometimes called ‚Äúthreat appeals‚Äù, however the label ‚Äúfear appeals‚Äù is justified if the appeal can be shown to arouse fear. Methods The fear pattern of an advertisement can largely be identified as either fear-relief or fear-only. A fear-relief pattern involves arousing fear and causing the audience to experience an unpleasant feeling that is then reduced by showing the consequences of the recommended behaviour. A fear-only pattern is created by only arousing fear and not reducing fear by providing relief components within an advertisement. The possibilities for different classifications of fear reduction include no reduction in fear (fear-only), partial reduction in fear (fear-partial relief), or complete reduction in fear (fear-relief). A dynamic, temporal measure of fear is necessary to determine the fear pattern exhibited by a broadcast (TV or radio) anti-speeding advertisement. This requires continuous response measurement (CRM). The fear patterning theory suggests that it is not the absolute amount of fear that drives attitude change or behaviour change, but the sequence of fear then reduction in fear, that is, relief felt by the audience. Relief is an emotion that is normally preceded by some other higher level of arousal, such as fear, or anxiety, that is, relief generally cannot occur without the precursor of the emotion of fear, and is a result of the removal or reduction of the fearful feeling. The fear pattern theory proposes that a sequence of fear then relief stimuli will be optimal in causing attitude and/or behaviour change. The proposed fear pattern theory builds on Hovland, Janis and Kelley‚Äôs fear- as-acquired-drive (drive-reduction) model that was one of the earlier major theories of how fear appeals work, based on the assumption that it is fear reduction that makes such an appeal effective. Drive-reduction theory assumes that ‚Äúthe reduction of emotional tension operates as a reinforcement of the reassuring recommendation.‚Äù That is, once fear is aroused and creates motivation for action (drive), any relief stimuli (such as the recommended behaviour) that decreases the fear is a reinforcement of the recommended behavior. Research The overwhelming majority of previous studies have focused upon the effect of fear arousal, but have not investigated the effect of fear reduction. Both SuttonSutton, Stephen R. (1982), ‚ÄúFear-Arousing Communications: A Critical Examination of Theory and Research‚Äù, in J. Eiser (Ed.), Social Psychology and Behavioural Medicine, 303-337, New York, Wiley and Job signaled the need for research into the effect of fear reduction.

Originally portrayed by Robert Emhardt from 1973 to 1974, Douglass Watson portrayed the role from 1974 until 1989. Mac was one of the Another World's most popular characters, and his pairing with Rachel Davis, portrayed by Victoria Wyndham, was one of the show's most beloved couples. After Watson died unexpectedly in May 1989, his death was written into the show with Mac dying off-screen of a heart attack. Character history =Backstory= Mackenzie Cory was born and raised in Fall River, Massachusetts. After studying at Dartmouth, he served in World War II. Mac then obtained an MA in journalism from Northwestern University. He married his first wife, Emily, in the 1930s. While married to Emily, Mac had an affair with Sylvie Kosloff, who, unbeknownst to him, became pregnant. When Sylvie was sent to prison, she asked Emily to adopt her baby. Emily took the baby home and named her Iris. Emily and Mac decided to raise Iris to believe she was Mac and Emily's biological daughter. Ironically, Mac was completely unaware that Iris was in fact his biological daughter. Mac became a multi-millionaire by building his company, Cory Publishing, into one of the country's biggest publishing houses. =Family= Mac had six children. He had one biological son, Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Cory, and three biological daughters, Iris Wheeler, Amanda Sinclair, and Paulina Carlino. Mac also raised Rachel's son Matthew as his own, and had a close relationship with Rachel's other son, Jamie Frame. Sandy was the product of a fling that Mac had with a woman named Miriam Sanderson. Mac was completely unaware of Sandy's existence until he came to Bay City. Amanda was the only biological child Mac and Rachel shared. Mac never met Paulina, who came to Bay City after his death. Mac had an affair with Paulina's mother, Maria Hernandez DeSilva, 30 years prior when he was a reporter covering the revolution in San Cristobal. Mac was forced to return to the United States, but he had planned to bring Maria over eventually. Those plans were canceled when Mac learned Maria died. Mac never knew that Maria had given birth to his child. Despite not being Matthew's biological father (Matthew was the product of one-night-stand between Rachel and Mitch Blake), Mac loved Matthew as his own from the time he was born. Even after Matthew found out the truth about his parentage, the two remained close until Mac's death, with Matthew considering Mac his father in every way that mattered. Mac also always considered Jamie to be his son as well, and the two of them were also very close. =Life in Bay City= Mac Cory first arrived in Bay City in 1973 to support Iris, whose son, Dennis, was ill. He decided to permanently settle down in Bay City and set up an office of Cory Publishing there. Iris threw a party in honor of her \\"Daddy\\", which Rachel Frame ended up crashing. Iris was having her thrown out when Mac came to Rachel's rescue. Mac sent her flowers the next day, and their romance began. Mac also formed a close bond with Rachel's son, Jamie, while Iris fumed over the relationship. During her relationship with Mac, Rachel began to find new depths in herself now that she had unconditional love and support. On Valentine's Day 1975, Rachel and Mac married at his townhouse in New York City. As a wedding present, Mac bought Rachel the mansion by the bay she used to walk by as a child and dream about living in. They were never happy for long, though, mostly due to Iris interfering every chance she could. Among Iris' many schemes was the hiring of a man to give Rachel horse-riding lessons, hoping the man would try to seduce her. When that didn't work, Iris hired someone at the mansion to cause trouble for Mac and Rachel. A wedge was being driven between Mac and Rachel, but things looked brighter when Rachel became pregnant. In one of her most despicable acts, when Rachel called Iris looking for Mac when she was in terrible pain, Iris just hung up the phone and never told her Daddy. Rachel sadly ended up miscarrying the baby. Mac and Rachel then began to drift apart. He spent his time focusing on moving his company completely to Bay City, while she focused on her art. Over the next decade, Mac and Rachel would divorce twice. However, after each divorce, they would eventually rekindle their romance and then get married again. They also had a child of their own together, a daughter named Amanda. They both also had other lovers and spouses along the way (Janice Frame, Mitch Blake, Alice Frame, and Steve Frame, among others). Having already remarried for the third and final time in 1983, Mac and Rachel renewed their wedding vows in 1986. The two spent the next few years together, committed and in love with each other. In 1989, Mac learned that Iris, who had returned to Bay City after an eight year absence, was in fact his biological daughter. Prior to Iris' return, a mysterious publishing house called Bennett Publishing had nearly brought Cory Publishing to the brink of destruction. The only thing that was known about Bennett Publishing was that it was run by someone called \\"The Chief.\\" Rachel teamed up with Donna Hudson to investigate, and found out \\"The Chief\\" was none other than Iris herself. Rachel confronted Iris about it, demanding that Iris tell Mac. Mac was devastated by the revelation that Iris was responsible for both the hostile takeover attempt of his company and for having him temporarily framed for murder. Mac disowned Iris and went to Maine to reflect on recent events. Mac died there shortly after of a heart attack, without having reconciled with Iris. Rachel was devastated by Mac's death, and tearfully buried the love of her life. He was her anchor, her lover, and her best friend. Although she eventually fell in love again and remarried years later, a part of her heart would always belong to Mac.

Dead bodies of 34 people have resurfaced there for over a period of time. Six months later, a TV channel plans to host a reality show in that haunted house. It is aptly called ‚ÄúDhayyam tho 7 Rojulu, Pattukunte 3 Kotlu‚Äù (Those who spend 7 days in this haunted Nandigama palace and survive will get Rs. 3 crores). Seven individuals namely, Ashwin (Ashwin Babu), Nandu (Chethan Cheenu), Barbie (Eshanya), Bala Tripura Sundari (Dhanya Balakrishna), Shivudu (Dhanraj), M Y Danam (Shankar) and Bujjimma (Vidyullekha Raman) are selected for the show. Program head Pakoddi (Prabhas Sreenu) and Chekodi (Raghu Babu) have arranged all kinds of scares for the contestants. Initially, everything is normal. But after some time, the contestants start feeling paranormal activities around them. Everyone begins to believe that the palace is indeed haunted, especially Ashwin. The only exception is Nandu, a doctor who refuses to accept such supernatural stories. Meanwhile, Ashwin reveals his past to Bala. His brother Dr. Karthik (Rajiv Kanakala) had begun revolution of donating organs. But suddenly, he was found dead, and his body was discovered at the Mahal in Nandigama. Seeing Dr. Karthik's corpse, Ashwin's mother suffered from strokes, and only to pay for the hospital charges, Ashwin has participated in this contest.

From there, he extracts his deceased brother's mobile phone. Ashwin shows the phone to Bala and on turning it on, they find a video shot by Dr. Karthik. The doctor had visited this palace, and discovered the same secret chamber where bodies were being mutilated. However, before he could expose the culprits, he was killed, his death being recorded on the phone. The culprits, caught on camera, are none other than Nandu and Barbie. In the next scene, Ashwin and Bala are injured and captured by Nandu in the chamber.

This whole reality show was set up by Ashwin with the help of police and media to catch the real murderers of his brother, and 30 others who died in the palace. Nandu and Barbie run an organ smuggling racket here. Ashwin had suspected them, which is why they were selected. It is further revealed that all the hauntings that occurred few days ago with Barbie and others were orchestrated by Ashwin and Shivudu (the latter is revealed to be alive in the end).

It was written through several months of interviews with Ben Greenman. The book was published by Da Capo Press on October 11, 2016, one month after the release of co- founder Mike Love's autobiography: Good Vibrations: My Life as a Beach Boy. I Am Brian Wilson supersedes Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story, Wilson's disowned autobiography published in 1991. Background Wilson performing in 2015 The memoir was announced in April 2013, reported to be written with journalist Jason Fine, published by Coronet Books, and given a 2015 release date. While Wilson's website stated that he \\"will describe for the first time the epic highs and lows of his life\\", The Guardian noted that Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story had covered many of the same topics mentioned by the site. However, the 1991 book is considered \\"controversial\\" in Wilson lore, and predates his solo resurgence of the 2000s. In June 2015, Wilson reported: \\"One guy crapped out on me, so I‚Äôm doing it with somebody else. It has to be done.\\" In February 2016, it was reported that the book was \\"years in the making and [has] already seen at least one co-author hired and fired\\". Wilson said that the book was about \\"three-quarters\\" finished and that it was being written with help from friend Ray Lawlor. He likened the writing process to therapy, saying: \\"There are a lot of memories that go along with my book. I have to take the good memories with the bad memories.\\" The book was ultimately completed with New York-based writer Ben Greenman. According to Wilson, the process involved many telephone interviews over the course of eight months, each lasting about 40 minutes. Greenman then put together the book. When asked how he dealt with his inability to recollect some events, Wilson responded: \\"Well, the book needed to be factual. We did the movie [2015's Love & Mercy] first, which was factual‚Äîbut it had parts of it that weren't actually as factual‚Äîbut doing it helped my memory. So that helped with writing the book, which is almost all factual. I hope people can relate to it because none of it's fiction, as wild as some of it seems. It's fact!\\" Legitimacy Free Beacons C.W. Mahoney suggests that the book's authorship may not be any more legitimate than My Own Story. Journalist David Hepworth also wrote that \\"one senses\\" it was \\"guided by Wilson's wife and manager, Melinda\\". Earlier in 2014, the project was met with skepticism by former collaborator Van Dyke Parks, who was approached for questioning by Fine's assistant via Twitter, responding, \\"Doesn't sound 'auto' to me!\\" When asked about negative comments Wilson made in the book, Love responded: \\"He's not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there's not tape of it. But, I don't like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know he has a lot of issues. Out of compassion, I don't respond to everything that is purportedly said by him.\\" As of November 2016, Love has not read Wilson's book. Critical response Forbes Brad Auerbach calls the book \\"a wonderful insight into a troubled genius ... his voice definitely comes through. ... Like many autobiographies, Wilson follows a generally linear approach, but he often skips around a straight chronological approach. This works well, as his mind connects sounds and visions across decades.\\" The Wall Street Journals David Kirby wrote that \\"Wilson‚Äôs poker- faced acceptance [is] a reminder to take life as it comes. Part of the charm of his account is the way he drops little moments into the story with no preamble and then moves on with no follow-through.\\" The New York Times Alan Light reviewed: \\"At its best, I Am Brian Wilson has an odd, unpredictable rhythm, ... it does offer some fascinating glimpses under the hood.\\" Telegraphs Helen Brown characterizes Love's book as \\"more credible but ‚Äì as his book goes on ‚Äì also more tedious ... Wilson‚Äôs book has more sadness ... and more moments of magic.\\" She surmised that it \\"must have been torture\\" for Greenman to \\"drag anything out of Wilson ... [who] admits to memory problems and to making things up to 'test' people. ... Whatever Greenman‚Äôs pain, the torture was probably greater for Wilson, who prefers to evade his traumatic past when questioned and speaks mostly in banalities ‚Äì when he speaks at all.\\" Mahoney believes that Greenman \\"must have languished for hours on end as Wilson oozed in and out of consciousness in his La-Z-Boy ... Greenman did a nice job of capturing Wilson's authorial voice, but is it a voice worth hearing?\\". Hepworth criticizes that both books \\"take themselves preposterously seriously,\\" that neither \\"seem[s] to realise just how absurd his life has been,\\" and that Wilson has a tendency to \\"perfect[ly] recall ... every compliment he has ever been paid by a well-known musician.\\" Mahoney, who compares Wilson to a grown-up version of Anthony Fremont (the child tyrant character from The Twilight Zone), notes that the book contains \\"no real revelations about [Wilson's] troubled family relationships, few lurid stories of his legendary drug abuse, [and] zero epiphanies about his creative mind\\". According to Mahoney, \\"Wilson‚Äôs own experiences have left him completely devoid of insight ... Instead, they regurgitate anecdotes that have been floating around the mythology already ... Wilson also takes the opportunity to elaborate his victim narrative ... While Wilson deserves pity for his struggles with sanity, that pity is stretched to the breaking point when you realize how [many millions of dollars] he could afford to throw away.\\" See also * \\"Brian Wilson is a genius\\" References Category:American biographies Category:Brian Wilson Category:Music autobiographies Category:American memoirs Category:Books about rock musicians Category:Da Capo Press books Category:2016 non-fiction books Category:Literary collaborations ","title":"I Am Brian Wilson"},{"id":"49369955","text":"First Congregational Church of Riverside, CA is located at 3504 Mission Inn Ave. It was founded in 1872 and is part of the United Church of Christ (UCC).

He was born into a cosmopolitan family, with a Czech father and a boyaress mother, but his formative years were marked by life in the small boroughs of Western Moldavia. Trained as a lawyer and employed for a while as a publisher, Dau»ô joined the body of experts at the Ministry of Royal Domains, climbing through the bureaucratic ranks. In parallel, he advanced his literary career: a noted dramatist, he was an unremarked poet and historical novelist prior to World War I. His translation work covered several languages, and includes Romanian versions of The Kreutzer Sonata, Madame Bovary, and Eug√©nie Grandet. After being welcomed into the literary salon headed by Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Dau»ô moved between literary clubs. By 1918, he had adopted a Romanian nationalist discourse in his poetry and, increasingly, in his political career. He had several new commissions in Greater Romania, and in particular Bessarabia, where he is remembered as the first chairman of Chi»ôinƒÉu National Theater. Dau»ô went on to serve in the Assembly of Deputies and Senate, where he affirmed the interests of Bessarabian peasants and advocated radical land reform; initially a member of the local Independent Party, he later caucused with the National Liberals. During the interwar, Dau»ô was also loosely affiliated with the modernist circle SburƒÉtorul. He matured as a writer, earning praise and drawing controversy with works of political fiction which bridged a neo-romantic subject matter with elements of the psychological novel; he also shocked theatergoers with his explicit play about Vlad »öepe»ô. He continued to work for the stage during World War II, and was briefly a manager of Caragiale Theater, dying shortly after the inauguration a communist regime.

Such works were alternated by novels and novellas: StrƒÉbunii (\\"The Forefathers\\", 1900); Du»ômani ai Neamului (\\"Enemies of the Nation\\", 1904); Iluzii (\\"Illusions\\", 1908); Satana (\\"Satan\\", 1912).CƒÉlinescu, p. 1026; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 340; Gancevici, pp. 365‚Äì367 All these were panned by critic Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu, who sees Dau»ô's early career as \\"quite fecund, but producing only countless illegible works.\\"CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 340 Most were focused on the legendary period before and during the Founding of Moldavia.Gancevici, p. 365 Dau»ô became loosely affiliated with Literatorul magazine, which reunited Romanian Symbolists with poets who had left the Hasdeu circle. According to historian Nicolae Iorga, at that stage Dau»ô was still a \\"literary dilettante\\".Iorga, p. 13 His various works were by then carried by publications of many hues, including Familia, LuceafƒÉrul, Vatra, and LiteraturƒÉ »ôi »òtiin»õƒÉ.Colesnic, p. 211; Naghiu, p. 529 In AdevƒÉrul daily, he published several popular translations in feuilleton, using the pen name \\"Adrian Daria\\";Naghiu, pp. 529, 531 other pseudonyms he used for such work include \\"Adina G.\\" and \\"Ludovic D.\\" (the latter used for George Ranetti's Zeflemeaua).Colesnic, p. 211 In 1894, and again in 1897, he and poet Radu D. Rosetti published the literary weekly Doina, named after the singing style. For a while in 1903, with Emil Conduratu, he put out another magazine, Ilustra»õiunea Rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"Romanian Illustration\\").Naghiu, p. 529 =World War I and Bessarabia= A secretary of the prototype Romanian Writers' Society during its first meetings of 1908,Victor Durnea, \\"Societatea scriitorilor rom√¢ni\\", in Dacia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 2/2008 Dau»ô cut off his links with the Literatorul circle. In 1912, he was writing for Floare AlbastrƒÉ, the anti-Symbolist review put out at Ia»ôi by A. L. Zissu.Iorga, p. 243 From 1914, he became a legal expert for the common land department of the Domains Ministry. Dau»ô also returned with poetry volume, √én zƒÉri de foc (\\"Toward Fiery Horizons\\"), which came out in 1915, and with translations of Gustave Flaubert‚ÄîSalammb√¥ in 1913, Madame Bovary in 1915. He is hailed by some scholars as Romania's best Flaubertian translator.Gancevici, p. 367 In late 1916, Romania entered World War I, but was invaded by the Central Powers. In October 1916, his poem honoring the dead of Turtucaia was hosted in Viitorul newspaper and then in George Co»ôbuc's Albina.Ludovic Dau»ô, \\"Turtucaia\\", in Albina. RevistƒÉ EnciclopedicƒÉ PopularƒÉ, Nr. 1‚Äì2/1916, p. 6 With Bucharest occupied by the Germans, Dau»ô fled to Ia»ôi, where the Romanian administration had relocated. During that time, he translated stories by the Countess of S√©gur. Late in the war, his career became focused on Bessarabia, which had recently united with Romania, and he served as founding director (from 1918) of the Chi»ôinƒÉu National Theater.Colesnic, pp. 210‚Äì211; Gancevici, pp. 364‚Äì365 He declared himself especially impressed by the \\"superstitious\\" religiousness and aristocratic dignity of Bessarabian peasants, becoming a champion of their case.Colesnic, p. 213 In 1920, some of his new poetry was hosted in the local journal, Vulturul Basarabean. During his stays in Bucharest, Dau»ô began frequenting with the modernist salon SburƒÉtorul from its inception in 1919 and also published with regularity in the eponymous magazine.Eugen Lovinescu, \\"SburƒÉtorul Literar\\" (manifesto), in SburƒÉtorul Literar, Nr. 1/1921, p. 1 However, according to colleague I. Peltz, was only welcomed there with \\"kind condescension\\" by the SburƒÉtorul house critic, Eugen Lovinescu.Peltz, p. 89 Within this society, Dau»ô mainly associated with older figures, including Alexandru VƒÉitoianu and Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu.Peltz, pp. 85‚Äì86, 89, 108 This positioning also reflected Lovinescu's verdicts: he describes Dau»ô as a neo-romantic in the proximity of SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul traditionalism.Lovinescu, p. 195 Dau»ô, Iustin FrƒÉ»õiman, and Iosif Sanielevici on the Independent Party of Bessarabia ballot, November 1919 election Active politically, Dau»ô joined the minor Independent Party of Bessarabia, established by Iustin FrƒÉ»õiman, Sergiu Ni»õƒÉ, and Constantin Stere, running on its lists during the election of 1919.Svetlana SuveicƒÉ, Basarabia √Æn primul deceniu interbelic (1918‚Äì1928): modernizare prin reforme.

He went on to serve in Greater Romania's Assembly of Deputies and Senate, attending Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences.Gancevici, p. 365; Naghiu, p. 528 He favored a radical land reform that reflected Socialist-Revolutionary influence, excoriating the Bessarabian Peasants' Party for moderating such promises, and singling out Ion Buzdugan and Ion Incule»õ as traitors of the peasants. Rallying with the National Liberal Party, and serving in the Senate during the 1922‚Äì1926 legislature, Dau»ô spoke out for Bessarabian and nationalist causes. Noting the hostile Romanian‚ÄìSoviet relations, he favored annexing the Moldavian ASSR to Greater Romania.Radu Filipescu, \\"Rom√¢nii transnistreni √Æn dezbaterile Parlamentului Rom√¢niei (1919‚Äì1937)\\", in Acta Moldaviae Septentrionalis, Vol. X, 2011, pp. 217, 219 In September 1926, his connections with Bessarabia were severed, as Ion Livescu took over his managerial position at the region's National Theater. The troupe protested at the time, demanding that Dau»ô be reinstated.Colesnic, p. 222 Dau»ô was also director of the State Press, president of the Romanian Athenaeum and of the Bessarabian Press Association, and eventually deputy director of the Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company.CƒÉlinescu, p. 920; Gancevici, pp. 364‚Äì365. See also Naghiu, p. 528 He returned to publishing first as a poet, with the 1919 Valea AlbƒÉ (\\"White Valley\\")‚Äîa dramatic poem about the eponymous battle of 1476; and the 1924 Drumul s√¢ngelui (\\"Trail of Blood\\"). The latter was an homage to the soldiers dead at MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti and elsewhere on the Romanian front.Gancevici, pp. 365, 367. See also Naghiu, p. 529‚Äì530 Dau»ô's translations of verse drama included Victor Hugo Le roi s'amuse and William Shakespeare's King Lear (both 1924). He continued in that field with a new play centered on, and named after, Vlad »öepe»ô, performed at the Bucharest National Theater and published in 1930. It earned notoriety and disgust with its depictions of medieval cruelty, including impalement and death by boiling; reviewer Mihail Sevastos sarcastically noted that Dau»ô only \\"stopped short of cutting off the actresses' breasts\\" and never dramatized Vlad's alleged raping by Mehmed the Conqueror. Also according to Sevastos, the play was political theater, urging for the return of a Vlad-like dictator.Mihail Sevastos, \\"Cronica teatralƒÉ\\", in Via»õa Rom√ÆneascƒÉ, Nr. 2/1931, pp. 187‚Äì188 =Literary prominence and later life= Dau»ô's interwar prose drew more attention, and is generally seen as much more accomplished than his earlier output. According to CrohmƒÉlniceanu, his novels of the 1920s and '30s were \\"interesting, commendable for their social observation\\", with \\"an actual writer's skill.\\" According to Lovinescu, Dau»ô only discovered his literary point of view \\"at the age when most others lose theirs.\\" The series includes 1927's DrƒÉceasca schimbare de piele (\\"A Devilish Shedding of the Skin\\"), in which a middle-aged woman embraces marital infidelity, then insanity, as she changes into the clothes of a courtesan.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 340; Lovinescu, pp. 195‚Äì196; »òƒÉineanu, pp. 108‚Äì109 Among the reviewers of the time, Constantin »òƒÉineanu was largely unimpressed, reading DrƒÉceasca schimbare... as an implausible \\"exceptional, abnormal, sickly case, to be addressed by medical clinics.\\" The eroticized episodes, »òƒÉineanu argues, \\"are supposed to pass for action.\\"»òƒÉineanu, p. 109 Published in 1932, Asfin»õit de oameni (\\"A Dimming of Men\\") documented the decline of boyardom, replaced by \\"a social mix of Levantines\\", depicted \\"with remarkable objectivity and astuteness\\". As noted by CƒÉlinescu, the upstart and murderer Vangheli Zionis, originally the antagonist, appears more likeable by the end of the book, when he is contrasted with the sadistic boyaress Nathalie Dragnea. Based on \\"romanticized historical truth\\", the novel is \\"not entirely transfigured by art\\".CƒÉlinescu, pp. 919‚Äì920; Colesnic, p. 211. See also Gancevici, p. 366 Highlighting its narrative of class conflict, Lovinescu sees the novel as a revamped SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist work, but \\"solid, realistic, honest\\", and \\"without romantic rhetoric.\\"Lovinescu, p. 196 A final novel, titled O jumƒÉtate de om (\\"Half a Man\\"), came out in 1937. Noted by CrohmƒÉlniceanu for its \\"ingenious intrigue\\" and its \\"nervous\\" writing,CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 341 it follows the submissive and exploitable Traian Belciu through a series of existential failures. These culminate with him being swept up by the world war, dragged into Germanophile circles, and ultimately shot as a deserter. It is, in Lovinescu's view, the best book by Dau»ô‚Äîaccomplished as a work of political fiction, but largely failed as a psychological novel, and out of step with modernism. By the time of its publishing, Dau»ô's activity as a translator also covered works by Honor√© de Balzac (a version of Eug√©nie Grandet came out in 1935) and Fran√ßois Copp√©e (Les Jacobites). His translations from Heine were put to music by the Transylvanian Emil Mon»õia. Having been awarded the Romanian Writers' Society prize in 1938, the following year he put out memoirs in the magazine Jurnalul Literar.CƒÉlinescu, p. 1026; Colesnic, p. 211 That year, answering Gherman P√¢ntea's invitation, he also returned to Bessarabia to unveil a monument honoring Ferdinand I of Romania, using the occasion to reinforce unionist sentiment with a patriotic speech.Colesnic, pp. 211‚Äì212 As an associate of Victor Dombrovski, the Mayor of Bucharest, Dau»ô helped organize the June 1939 commemoration of Mihai Eminescu, Romania's national poet, to whom he dedicated several speeches and poems.Naghiu, p. 529, 529, 530‚Äì531 His final works, published during World War II, were the play Ioana (1942) and the novella collection Porunca toamnei (\\"Autumn Commands\\", 1943). The former was performed at Bucharest's Studio Theater, and had considerable success. It contrasted the eponymous female hero with a decadent bourgeois society. Following King Michael's Coup in August 1944, with Dombrovski returning as Mayor, Dau»ô was made co-director of Caragiale Theater, sharing this distinction with actor Ion Manolescu and producer SicƒÉ Alexandrescu.Lucian Sinigaglia, \\"Universul teatral bucure»ôtean »ôi politicile culturale dupƒÉ 23 august 1944.

Some confusion persists as to his date of death, as some sources have 1953;Colesnic, p. 212 the most precise accounts indicate that he died on November 17, 1954 and was laid to rest two days after. He left various manuscripts, including a verse chronicle of World War II, titled Anii cerni»õi (\\"Years of Mourning\\"), and the unfinished novel RƒÉscruci (\\"Junctions\\").Naghiu, pp. 530, 532 At least three other notebooks of his own poetry, and an \\"impressive number\\" of poetry translations (notably, from Charles Baudelaire, Alexander Pushkin, and Paul Verlaine), all remain unpublished.Gancevici, pp. 365, 367‚Äì368.

Despite the name, it is a volcanic crater lake rather than a lagoon. History El Junco inhabits a crater formed by the collapsed caldera of a volcano. Research has indicated the lake to have been extant since the end of the last ice age. Being the only source of fresh water in the Galapagos Islands, its presence led to the first permanent settlements on the island. The name El Junco is Spanish for sedge which is endemic to the islands. During World War II, American forces stationed at the military base on Baltra Island utilized El Junco as a primary source of water, due to it being the closest available source of freshwater. The lake is managed by the Galapagos National Park Service. =Flooding= Due to the lake's lack of a permanent outflow, heavy rains can cause the lake to breach its banks. Several flood incidents, often corresponding to El Nino, have been recorded. Flooding in 1978 led to an outflow being recorded at per hour. Similar events in 1978 and 1998 caused serious damage to the nearby Puerto Baquerizo Park. Ecology =Flora= The name El Junco is a reference to the endemic sedge (Cyperus anderssonii) which can be found growing close to the lake. Additionally, the endangered Galapagos miconia (Miconia robinsoniana) can be found in the highlands surrounding the lake. Only two populations are known to occur in the wild, the other being in the highlands of nearby Santa Cruz island. =Fauna= Many species of birds inhabit the lake area including the endemic San Crist√≥bal mockingbird and white-cheeked pintail. Due to its status as an isolated source of fresh water, it is also one of the few place to witness frigatebirds preening their feathers. Research According to a 1966 study by Dr. Paul Colinvaux, sediment at the bottom of the lagoon has a thickness of . Using radiocarbon dating, it has been found that of the top layer were deposited during the last 10,000 years, with the remaining deposited during periods of drought over the course of 38,000 years, giving a total sediment age of 48,000 years. It is believed that the climate of the Galapagos went through a dry period caused by glacial advances in the Northern Hemisphere, beginning 48,000 years ago and ending 10,000 years ago.

Biography Mitchell was born in Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia. Her father, Elliott Coates, was a merchant navy officer and her mother, Mary Peck, was an actress. Her parents' marriage ended in 1932, and she lived with foster parents during World War II while her mother worked in a munitions factory. She was educated at Eveline Girls High School in Bulawayo, and later at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, where she studied history and the Shona language. She married hydraulic engineer Brian Mitchell in 1956, and they had three children. Mitchell's political activism began in 1966, when she campaigned to save a nursery school which was bulldozed by the government. The campaign later expanded to a broader one to improve education for black children. In 1968, she was involved with the Centre Party; although she ran as an independent candidate in the 1974 elections and for the National Unifying Force (NUF) in the 1977 elections. After Smith's 1970 declaration of Rhodesia as a republic, Mitchell was involved with arranging negotiations between Smith's Rhodesian Front and militant nationalists. Working with journalists Robert Cary and Willie Musarurwa, she compiled and published a definitive biographical compilation of leaders in the nationalist movement, African Nationalist Leaders in Rhodesia: Who's Who. Although delighted at Zimbabwe's eventual independence under terms acceptable to the international community in 1980, Mitchell was critical of the Mugabe government's suppression of the media and political opposition. She and her husband moved to Britain in 2003. Brian died in 2010. In 2011, Mitchell's extensive collection of political clippings and papers were donated to the Hoover Institution, which opened them for public access, and to the University of Cape Town.

The statue is on a bronze and silver base, 152 cm high, made in 1530-40 by Aurelio, Ludovico, and Girolamo Lombardo.

The fragmented bronze vine that was found with the statue and originally held in the right hand was no longer attached; that vine led to the misidentification as Bacchus.

In the same year, the primary and secondary school split into two entities, Pin Hwa Independent High School and SJK(C) Pin Hwa, with the primary school having a student population of 2,100. In 1974, SJK(C) Pin Hwa was split once again due to student overpopulation, this time into SJK(C) Pin Hwa 1 and SJK(C) Pin Hwa 2. Due to lack of classrooms, there were more classes in Pin Hwa 1, which had a total of 1,656 students, all of which would attend the afternoon session until the end of 1987. In 1988, the Ministry of Education introduced the new KBSR syllabus, while SJK(C) Pin Hwa 1 & 2 improved their facilities, allowing for the two schools to rotate between morning and afternoon sessions for classes. In 1980, a three-storey school building was built, and construction was finally completed at the end of 1981. Datuk Liu Jihan, the former Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry, was invited to host the opening ceremony of the new building. The rapid development of Pin Hwa Independent High School prompted the demolition of eight old classrooms which the primary school had been borrowing at the time, and it urgently needed to build a new four-storey school building to cope. With the support of its alumni and the local community, the new school building was finally completed in mid-1989. On the eve of the school's 66th anniversary, the former Menteri Besar of Selangor, Tan Sri Mohamed Taib, presided over the opening ceremony. New housing areas being built in the suburban areas and new families living further away from the city centre led to SJKC Pin Hwa 2, along with its sister school SJKC Pin Hwa 1, relocating in 2001. Pin Hwa 1 moved to a plot of land in Setia Alam, Shah Alam in year 2007, while Pin Hwa 2 moved to Aman Perdana, Klang, Selangor at the end of 2008 and has been operating there since 5 January 2009. The school started with 13 classrooms and 375 students and 28 teachers in 2009.

The 1790 farmstead was purchased in 1929 by poet Robert Frost, and served as his primary residence until 1938. During this period of residency, Frost was awarded two Pulitzer Prizes for his poetry. The property was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1968; its landmark designation was withdrawn in 1986 after its private owners made alterations that destroyed important historic elements of the property. Description and history The former Frost Farm is located in southern Shaftsbury, a rural community in southwestern Vermont, on the south side of Buck Hill Road, roughly midway between United States Route 7 and Vermont Route 7A. It consists of with a mix of fields and woods, with the main farm complex set on a drumlin with views to the north. The main house is a 1-1/2 story Cape, built about 1790, but altered somewhat by Frost after his purchase, and further altered by later owners. Also on the property are a barn and two smaller frame structures, the latter both used by Frost as writing studios. The farm was purchased by Robert Frost in 1929, and was probably occupied by the family in 1930. Although it was the Frosts primary residence, it was generally only occupied by them on weekends and summers, when Frost's academic duties made it possible. Frost did a significant amount of writing while living here, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1931 and 1937. After Frost's wife died in 1938, he spent much less time here. The property remained in the family until 1963, when it was sold to artist Kenneth Noland, who maintained it in sympathy to the Frost history. During his ownership period, the property was designated a National Historic Landmark, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A subsequent owner made incompatible alterations to the property in 1984, and the Park Service withdrew its landmark designation two years later. It remains listed on the National Register.

Biography  Thomas Geoffrey Charles Michael Taylour, known to family and friends simply as Michael, was born on 20 January 1932 to Terence Geoffrey Thomas Taylour, 5th Marquess of Headfort and Elise Florense Tucker. He was educated at Stowe School in Stowe, Buckinghamshire, England, before attending Christ's College, Cambridge. While there, he was a member of the university air squadron. It was during this time, also, that he had his first brush with the law, being fined for ¬£2 for driving in Acton with his arm around a girl. In 1955 he received his Bachelor of Arts, and four years later a Master of Arts. He received a certificate of proficiency in rural estate management from Christ's College. He also received his qualification as a commercial pilot. In 1953, he began his career working as a director at Bective Electrical Co., before working as a sales manager and chief pilot at Lancashire Aircraft Co. in 1959. In 1958, he married The Hon. Elizabeth Angela Veronica Rose Nall-Cain, a goddaughter of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and the sole daughter of The 2nd Baron Brocket at St James's Church, Spanish Place. Two years later, the couple travelled to Africa, selling aircraft. With her he had three children: * Thomas Michael Ronald Christopher Taylour, 7th Marquess of Headfort (b. 10 February 1959) * Lady Rosanagh Elizabeth Angela Mary Taylour (b. 20 January 1961) * Lady Olivia Sheelin Davina Anne Taylour (b. 4 October 1963) Following his father's sudden death in Monte Carlo in October 1960, he acceded to become the Marquess of Headfort on 24 October. His maiden speech as a member of the House of Lords discussed air safety, and he quickly became interested in politics, particularly Irish politics. He ran for the Seanad √âireann, the Irish Senate, in 1973 with only the nomination the Irish Georgian Society in 1973, but lost with only a few votes. By 1968, his marriage with Elizabeth Nall-Cain was collapsing, and the ensuing divorce proceedings in 1969 in the Isle of Man led the legal disputes with her and other family members, causing significant financial hardship. He was forced to sell Headfort House, the historic seat of the Marquess of Headfort, for ¬£1 million, to B.J. Kruger, a Canadian multimillionaire. His departure was the cause of much mourning by estate workers, as he was well liked. By now, all that remained of his inheritance were 16 acres of bog in County Cavan. For some time afterward, he lived in Hong Kong, where he was an honorary Inspector of Police. He later moved to the Philippines, the home of his second wife, Virginia Nable, a friend of Imelda Marcos. The two married in 1972. Settling in a bungalow complex called Kenlis House on Lubang Island, he was active in the coast guard and donated a public library to the local municipality. He also maintained a residence in Manila. In 1987, he ended his term in the House of Lords. His final speech was a tribute to the accomplishments of Alcoholics Anonymous. On 21 October 2005, he died at the age of 73. His funeral took place in Manila, Philippines.  Mental health  The Marquis of Headfort suffered from bipolar disorder that occasionally necessitated hospitalisation. This was related to a period of alcoholism. As a result, to these conditions, police intervention was required on at least one occasion in 1965, when, at the age of 33, he was escorted by the police to St Lawrence's Hospital, Bodmin, after hiring a waiter to row him out in a boat to an uninhabited island in the Isles of Scilly, and during the trip, asked him to kill Prime Minister Harold Wilson. This episode received national attention and was widely recorded, despite Headfort's later denial of the incident. In another, unrelated, incident, neighbours reported how he had fired three blanks into the ceiling of a local pub during a party.

Description The excavations of the French Archaeological School revealed the remains of a rectangular building measuring 15.27 x 6.35 m situated between the temple of Apollo and the theatre. Its walls stand to a height of 4 meters. The building was probably a portico with Ionic or Doric columns on the facade. On its rear wall was discovered a dedicatory inscription in ten verses, according to which the building was identified with a panhellenic sanctuary, known from the ancient sources as the ex voto of Craterus, the Macedonian general and close friend of Alexander the Great. Plutarch mentionsPlutarch, Life of Alexander, 40.5 that Craterus dedicated in Delphi a bronze sculpted complex, made by the famous 4th century B.C. sculptors Leochares and Lysippos. Pliny,Pliny, H.N., xxxiv, 63-64 however, attributes the work solely to Lysippos. The sculpture depicted the scene of a lion hunt, i.e. a well-known incident of Alexander's life, when he was saved by Craterus during a lion hunt in the East. According to the inscription, the ex voto was dedicated not by Craterus himself, but by his son, after his father's death, probably around 320 B.C., or at the end of the 4th century B.C. Lion hunt mosaic, House of Dionysus, Pella The sculpture, lost today, would have been placed on a pedestal against the back wall of the building, whereas the figures would have been arrayed one next to the other. The attempts at a reconstruction are based on ancient sources as well as on some preserved works of art that seem to be inspired by the specific ex voto. For example, a base decorated in relief with the depiction of a lion hunt found in Messina and displayed now in the Louvre, is possibly copying the Delphi sculpture. It has also been suggested that the lion hunt scene from the mosaic pavement of the \\"House of Dionysus\\" in Pella repeats the same pattern. In the ex-voto of Delphi Alexander and Craterus either on horseback or on foot- probably stood to the right and left of the lion, engaged in a heroic battle against it. Another suggestion is that Craterus was on horseback and Alexander on foot. The work was a closed composition with the hunting scene developed in the centre.

Formed in 2003, the band has produced four studio albums and a live album. Minus Six has not played continuously since 2003, and has taken two hiatuses - for three months in summer of 2010 and the other from mid-2011 to mid-2012, both a result of lead singer and piano player Kevin Carton's travels. In addition to Carton, the band features Kameron Rummans on bass, Matt Sivertsen on saxophone, and Rob Baner on drums Former members include Jamie Hopkins and Tyler Kaschke, both former drummers. Minus Six takes its name from its lack of six string guitar, a standard instrument in their genre. Instead, they rely on piano, saxophone, and bass guitar to provide melodic backing. History =Overdue & Some Things Change= Minus Six was started in 2003, and recorded their first album, Overdue, in a basement studio when the majority of its original four members (Carton, Rummans, Sivertsen, and Kaschke) were still in high school. Following this first effort, a meeting with Matchbox Twenty- affiliated producer Joe Hand encouraged the band members to pursue their music more seriously, resulting in a more professionally produced second album, Some Things Change, in 2005. =Hidden Deep in the Green= Between the 2005 release of Some Things Change and the 2007 release of their next studio album, Hidden Deep in the Green, Kaschke left the band and drummer Rob Baner joined the ensemble. Hidden Deep in the Green was described as having \\"the vibe of a musical-theatre soundtrack,\\" praised for Carton's strong musical skills and Sivertsen's saxophone lines, but also billed as straightforward, with a lack of dynamic change to add interest. =Lucid Dreams= Following Hidden Deep in the Green, Minus Six went on a series of hiatuses to allow Carton to travel. They returned with drummer Jamie Hopkins in 2012 for the live album Lucid Dreams, which featured live versions of songs from previous albums, sometimes significantly reworked from their older iterations, as well as songs that would later be recorded in-studio. =Come Out From Where You Hide= By 2013, Baner had returned as drummer for the release of the band's fourth studio album, Come Out From Where You Hide. Come Out From Where You Hide featured professionally recorded versions of several of the songs first heard on Lucid Dreams, as well as several songs that had not been previously recorded. Come Out From Where You Hide displays strong influence from Carton's travels to France and Africa. Carton (who wrote all fifteen songs for the album) also made an effort to vary the construction of the music and include diverse topics - not just love songs. The attempts at variety were praised, and the songs were once again compared to musical theater, but as with Hidden Deep in the Green, critics found the songs to be too much alike.

They constitute excellent specimens of mid-6th century B.C. art, coming from workshops in Ionia, or, to a certain extent, Corinth. History During the excavations at the dump of the Sacred Way, opposite to the Halos, which was accidentally discovered in 1939, there were found several objects which had been buried because they were sacred and thus it was forbidden to sell or transform them. It seems that all these ex votos in Delphi had been probably destroyed by fire around the mid 5th century B.C. Some of those probably constituted a gold-and- ivory group depicting the Apollonian triad, namely Apollo, Artemis and Leto. The scholars have related these finds to the sumptuous ex-votos of Croesus, king of Lydia, which Herodotus so eloquently describes. This identification is however uncertain; the only certain fact is that the works are magnificent creations of the mid-6th century B.C., coming from workshops in Ionia, or, to a certain extent, Corinth. Apollo Apollo bears the distinctive archaic smile. His hair is made of gilded silver, with two broad curls flanking the head and falling on the shoulders made of a single golden leaf. The front part of the feet is discernible, while the rest are covered by the long garment. He probably held in his hand a precious vessel, possibly a shallow bowl (phiale). Artemis The head attributed to Artemis bears a mild, sweet expression. She wears a golden tiara and rosette-decorated earrings. Her garment was decorated with two large rectangular lamellae of gold, positioned vertically and bearing depictions of existing or mythological animals: a gazelle, a lion, a bull, a deer, a pegasus, a griffin, a sphinx. As in the case of Apollo, her eyes and eyebrows were made with an inlay technique. The artist probably originated from Ionia, possibly from Samos. Leto and other figures Apart from the third large head (attributed to Leto, the mother of the two gods) parts of other statues and five smaller ivory heads. Additional decorative elements are preserved, made of gold or ivory, among which stand out tiles with depictions of the Gorgon, Pegasus and a griffin, as well as rosettes, anthemia and floral items. Several decorative elements were probably attached to a wooden substratum, possibly to furniture.

Weber. The film stars Lexi Ainsworth as Jessica Burns, a 16-year-old bullied high school student who attempts suicide. The movie was originally titled The Bully Chronicles but the title was later changed.  Plot  Jessica Burns (Lexi Ainsworth), a sophomore in high school, attempts suicide by taking a handful of pills from her mother's medicine cabinet. Her mother soon finds her unconscious, and Jessica is rushed to a hospital. It is also mentioned that the high school she goes to has won a chance for a documentary for being the only public school to place as one of the top ten schools across the country. Word of Jessica's suicide attempt and hospitalization spreads quickly throughout the school, and the cameras catch students crying and talking about the situation. The camera crews go around interviewing kids about Jessica, and they reveal that her main tormentor was her former friend, Avery Keller (Hunter King). According to Jessica's best friend Brian (Jimmy Bennett), the two fell out after Jessica prevented Avery from cheating off of her test in a class, and Avery had been relentlessly bullying Jessica since - none of the other students in school seemed to be aware of these details, but had noticed subtle tension between the two. Avery casually denies ever bullying Jessica, and claims they simply drifted apart after transitioning from middle to high school. In response to the rumors, Avery agrees to record footage of her daily life to demonstrate the pressures of being popular. Though Avery herself is desensitized to it, her footage demonstrates that she comes from a dysfunctional family, and that her peers tend to feel intimidated by her teasing and controlling nature (for example, she and her clique restrict other girls from using a specific public restroom while they apply their makeup). Brian eventually confesses to the camera crew that six months ago, he and Jessica agreed to film Avery's bullying with a hidden camera disguised as a dragonfly pin. He invites them into his home to show them the footage, which documents Avery's constant physical harassment and floods of threatening texts and emails toward Jessica, encouraging Jessica to kill herself. The footage also shows Jessica crying alone in a school hallway, where Brian finds her. Jessica strongly suggests to Brian that she's having suicidal thoughts, and Brian tries in vain to console her and convince her to show their hidden camera footage to the school faculty. Jessica had made Brian promise not to show anyone else the footage, out of embarrassment and fear of Avery. While visiting Jessica in the hospital room later, Brian confesses to her mother that he had been withholding the footage - though she is noticeably upset, she reassures Brian that he should not blame himself for what happened to Jessica. The students at school grow further convinced that Avery had been bullying Jessica, causing the members of Avery's clique to turn on her. Avery's former friends present a statement to the school principal that the rumors of Avery's bullying are true, which prompts a conference between Avery, her parents and the principal. Avery's parents are in denial and staunchly defend her, but Avery storms out in frustration. She later films an insensitive video ranting about Jessica's suicide attempt and vehemently insisting on her own innocence, and uploads it on social media for all the other students to see. The camera crew approaches Avery again, advising her to remove the video and telling her they have footage that she bullied Jessica. They ask her if she wants to see it, and she agrees to meet them at her house that night. Later that night at the hospital, Jessica's parents are visiting her when she loses her pulse. Her parents and the cameras are kicked out of the ICU, as the doctors attempt to revive Jessica. At this point, Avery is watching the footage of her bullying Jessica. She begins to cry hysterically and admits that she regrets her actions, claiming that Jessica was her only real friend, as the filmmaker comforts her. The doctors are able to regain Jessica's pulse, but say that she will eventually succumb to total organ failure if she doesn't wake from the coma soon. Realizing the consequences of her actions, Avery posts another video, this time apologizing profusely and tearfully stating that no person deserves to be treated the way she treated Jessica. She ends the video with, \\"My name is Avery Keller, and I'm a bully.\\" The movie ends with a cut to Jessica's face as she opens her eyes.  Cast  * Hunter King as Avery Keller * Lexi Ainsworth as Jessica Burns * Jimmy Bennett as Brian Slater * Paul Lang as Dr. Webber  Reception  Justin Chang of Variety gave A Girl Like Her a mixed review, lauding the film as a \\"well-acted, well-meaning cautionary tale\\", but also criticizing it as \\"less and less convincing the more blatantly it strives for authenticity\\". Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter lauded the film's acting, noting that the \\"two young female leads, exceptionally well cast, deliver strong performances\\", but felt \\"the drama lapses into speechifying\\". Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an overall \\"fresh\\" rating of 65%. This included a few mixed reviews. One review declared it heartbreaking and emotional, but not that convincing as other movies about bullying. Another review had said, \\"A Girl Like Her unfolds with a clear-eyed approach to the subject ‚Äî a drama that fleshes out the principals and shows, without excusing the bully, that pain is not the exclusive domain of the victim.\\"  References   External links     Category:2015 films Category:2010s teen drama films Category:American films Category:American high school films Category:American teen drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about bullying Category:Films about suicide Category:Found footage films Category:2015 drama films ","title":"A Girl Like Her (2015 film)"},{"id":"49370735","text":"Brave Bull Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of South Dakota.

Additionally, the \\"player\\" will encounter rotating polyhedric gray rocks that, when touched, will flip the camera upside down and turn the floor into the ceiling.

She is notable for a 2014 controversy in which she, along with a colleague, was accused of abusing authority and embezzling public funds, taking advantage of the VA's PCS procedures. Career Rubens began her tenure in the VA as a director of the Western Area offices. She would later be promoted to the position of Deputy Under Secretary of Field Operations for the VBA. In 2013 she headed an initiative with the goal of processing the massive backlog of Veterans' claims within the VA systems. Eventually, Rubens would be promoted to the position of Executive Director of field-operations within the VBA at the Washington D.C. office. She volunteered in 2014 to head the Philadelphia regional office. Controversy In 2014 Rubens volunteered for a transfer from the D.C. regional office to the Philadelphia regional office to fill an opening that held considerably fewer responsibilities. She and her peer Kimberly Graves were allegedly informed by superior Allison Hickey, the former VA undersecretary for benefits, of loopholes within the VA's employee transfer program that would allow them to pocket large sums of taxpayer dollars. Hickey resigned her post in October 2015 amid investigations into her role aiding the two women in their transfer scheme. The VA announced it would review its transfer program due to the growing number of cases involving abuse of authority. Rubens expensed nearly $275,000 in moving fees to the VA while relocating to Philadelphia, attracting the attention of the VA's inspector general. Upon investigation, it was learned that Rubens had used her position to pressure a subordinate to leave his job at the Philadelphia office, thus opening that position. Rubens then volunteered for the position that held significantly reduced responsibilities, but managed to retain her $181,000 salary. Rubens and was transferred to a separate location and demoted while under investigation. Rubens and Graves both made appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board and pleaded the Fifth amendment regarding the allegations. The Inspector General recommended the Justice Department proceed with criminal charges. A judge overturned Rubens‚Äô demotion in January 2016, sparking outrage. The court stated that punishing Rubens and Graves was inconsistent disciplining behavior by the VA, since it had not similarly punished other employees that had committed offenses. The judge also cited her superiors‚Äô foreknowledge of her intent as evidence that no laws had been broken. Rubens was reinstated effective immediately and was awarded back-pay. The ruling to overturn her demotion was blasted by both Democratic representative Tim Walz and Republican Jeff Miller who criticized the VA‚Äôs lack of accountability and transparency. She was reinstated to her previous Philadelphia post with her previous, higher salary. The VA declared in early February that it would punish Rubens and Graves without demoting either. \\"Rubens and Graves clearly should have been fired\\" observed Miller, who went on to iterate a complete lack of confidence in the VA's transparency and integrity. In November 2015, it was learned that Rubens had received a bonus of over $8,000 in 2014 while under investigation for abusing her authority to embezzle public funds. The VA stated it lacked the authority to recover upwards of $400,000 from Rubens and Graves. Military veterans expressed outrage at Rubens‚Äô actions and at the VA‚Äôs refusal to fire her, to recoup the embezzled public funds, or to take meaningful actions to reprimand its employees that had broken the law. The American Legion expressed a similar dissatisfaction with the VA‚Äôs lack of discipline and, noting their retention of ample salaries, called the scandal an ‚Äúinsult and a disgrace to all veterans‚Äù. In addition, Pete Hegseth of Concerned Veterans for America accused Secretary of the VA Robert A. McDonald of ineffective leadership and of perpetuating a culture of dishonesty within the VA. Democrat Richard Blumenthal called the VA's reinstating of Rubens and Graves \\"an appallingly insufficient punishment\\". More broad criticisms have arisen about the accountability of federal employees, who are alleged to be very difficult to fire even after being proven to have committed corruption.

Born in FƒÉlticeni, his parents were Ecaterina and Ion, a priest and teacher; the family lived on the same road as Mihail Sadoveanu.Eugen Simion (ed.), Dic»õionarul general al literaturii Rom√¢ne, vol. 6, pp. 51-2. Bucharest: Univers Enciclopedic, 2007. He attended gymnasium in his native town, followed by the Boarding High School in Ia»ôi from 1897 to 1904. He subsequently studied literature and law at the University of Bucharest, earning a degree in the latter field. Obliged to earn his own money, he entered journalism in 1904, editing Minerva, Seara and Rom√¢nia newspapers. His work appeared in FlacƒÉra, Mi»ôcarea literarƒÉ, Diminea»õa, Presa, SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul, Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, LuceafƒÉrul and Cuv√¢ntul liber. He served as secretary general of the Romanian Writers' Society, which he had joined in 1911. His debut brochure, the 1906 Opera d-lui Ilarie Chendi, featured incisive observations; a polemical work that often unfairly targeted the journalistic activity of Ilarie Chendi, it drew wide comment. A reserve officer, he took part in both the Second Balkan War and World War I, often seeing frontline action. He returned to journalism after the war, initially at Arad; from 1928, he edited the official gazette of the National Peasants' Party, Dreptatea. In the first volume of Contimporanii (1920), he sketched biographical portraits of several writers he knew personally: Emil G√¢rleanu, N. D. Cocea, T. Robeanu, Cincinat Pavelescu, Panait Cerna, Ludovic Dau»ô, »òtefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel. Savel's short story collections √éntre re»õele (1919), √éntr-un sat de contrabandi»ôti (1920), Pribeag (1920) featured war themes. In particular, the first offers a vivid look at the life of a young officer in the trenches; the writing is skeptical, even misanthropic, reflecting a harsh reality and devoid of sentimentality or false patriotism. The 1926 novel Vadul ho»õilor also dealt with the war, imagining life in a border village during the conflict. A previous novel, the 1921 Miron Grindea, was only a partial success: while making pertinent observations about life in Romania at the dawn of the 20th century, its characters are wooden and its SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist outlook was already obsolete. Doine din rƒÉzboi (1925) featured verses in the doina style collected on the front during World War I. He translated works by Honor√© de Balzac, Alexandre Dumas, Karl Emil Franzos and Guy de Maupassant. He wrote accusatory articles from the front, published in Cuv√¢ntul liber beginning in December 1919; these were collected as Oamenii cari nu vorbesc (1921). While Savel's writing is endowed with a journalistic ease of expression, his stylistic lapses are sometimes magnified by a moralizing, pathos-laden tone.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, vol.

The story takes place in London, New York and West Africa, and focuses on two girls who can tap dance, alluding to Smith's childhood love of tap dancing. Plot Beginning in 2008, the novel tells the story of two mixed- race, black and white, girls who meet in 1982 in a tap class in London. The unnamed narrator, who has a white, working-class father, and a mother of Jamaican descent is immediately drawn to the precocious Tracey, who has a white mother and a black father in prison, as they have the same skin colour and are the only black children at their dance lessons. Despite the fact that the narrator's semi-intellectual mother looks down on Tracey, the two become best friends as they live in neighbouring estate flats. While the narrator's dance career is hampered by her flat feet, Tracey is something of a prodigy and goes on to win many awards. Tracey credits this in part to the fact that her father is one of Michael Jackson's backup dancers, a lie she makes up to explain his prolonged absences. When the girls are ten, a twenty-two year old Australian pop-star named Aimee becomes a world-wide sensation. At the birthday party of one of their friends the girls perform a sexualized dance, inspired by Aimee's dancing which is caught on tape by one of the girls and which is cut short when the mother of the birthday girl walks in on Tracey and the narrator on top of each other. In 1998 the narrator, newly graduated from college, is working at YTV, a music channel, and has a brief encounter with Aimee who comes to the station. When Aimee's assistant quits a month later, she hires the narrator to come work for her. When the narrator is in her 30s, Aimee decides to build an all girls school in a rural village in an unspecified country in West Africa (implied to be Gambia). The narrator is part of Aimee's advance team along with Lamin, a young Senegalese man. Aimee builds the school but the narrator finds the work they do there questionable and often useless. Reflecting back on her school years she recalls that, while she was identified by teachers as an advanced reader, she purposely failed her entrance exams for a grammar school. Meanwhile, Tracey attended a performing arts high school and the two mostly lost touch. Occasionally seeing each other around the neighbourhood the narrator runs into Tracey a handful of times during her teenage years, once when Tracey is having a drug overdose and another time when they are recruited by their old dance instructor to handle the tickets at the children's concert. Tracey steals the money from the concert and, when she is accused of doing so, she and her mother accuse the old piano player who accompanied the dancers as children of molesting Tracey. The narrator realizes that Tracey probably was sexually assaulted as a child by her own father. The narrator attends college and graduates jobless. Eventually she reunites with Tracey, who has a small part in a revival of Guys and Dolls and helps the narrator secure a position as a stagehand. After four months the narrator manages to get the internship at YTV. She tells this to Tracey along with the fact that she is quitting the show. In retaliation Tracey sends her a confessional letter telling the narrator that she saw her father having sex with a black blowup doll he had dressed like a golliwog. The narrator cuts off contact with Tracey, only seeing her again roughly eight years later during a performance of Show Boat. The narrator means to say hello to Tracey after the show but she instead sees Tracey's mother coming to pick her up with two small children, assumed to be Tracey's, in the backseat. In the present the narrator continues to visit the school Aimee built and hears rumours that Aimee is in love with Lamin and wants to bring him to the U.S. The rumours turn out to be true. The narrator is assigned degrading tasks which she thinks are punishment for her disapproval of Lamin and Aimee's relationship but turn out to be because the narrator's mother, now a Member of Parliament is openly criticizing the government of the country where Aimee's school is located. Visiting her mother, the narrator learns that Tracey has been in contact with her once again, at first because of a local issue involving her son being expelled and then contacting her three or more times a day to send abusive emails that are full of conspiracy theories. The narrator goes to Tracey's childhood flat, where she is still living, to find Tracey who is now overweight and has three children by three different men. Returning to West Africa for a final time with Aimee, the narrator witnesses an event where she and Aimee are introduced to a beautiful three day old baby. She also begins a brief sexual affair with Lamin, who is not in love with the narrator but is unhappy with his relationship with Aimee as Aimee is much older than him. Fern, one of the men who has been hired to work on the school and who is in love with the narrator discovers the relationship between the narrator and Lamin and grows jealous. Back in London, the narrator discovers to her shock that Aimee has adopted Sankofa, the baby they met in West Africa, through somewhat illegal means. Shortly after the narrator is fired as Fern revealed to Aimee that the narrator slept with Lamin. Angry after being thrown out of her home and realizing that her entire life was attached to Aimee, the narrator sends the news of the illegal adoption to gossip rags. Aimee and her team try to counter this by creating a blind item revealing the narrator's name, but the public is on the narrator's side. Aimee has her sent to London. Despite not loving Lamin, the narrator pays for him to meet her there. Once in London, the video tape of the narrator dancing provocatively with Tracey is released online by Tracey and Aimee manages to smooth over the adoption scandal by having the parents of her adopted child come forward and say they are happy. The narrator decides to move back in with her mother but discovers that she is in hospice care. She also discovers that Tracey has been continuing to send harassing emails to her mother throughout her illness. Nevertheless, the last time the narrator and her mother meet, the narrator's mother begs her to adopt Tracey's children so that they will be taken care of properly. The narrator decides that rather than adopt or ignore them she will seek out a middle ground. The book ends on the day her mother dies when, instead of going to see her mother at the hospice, she goes to Tracey's flat and sees her and her children dancing together. Allusions to other works The novel references numerous Hollywood musicals as the unnamed narrator is obsessed with them as a child. It takes its title from the 1936 George Stevens movie Swing Time starring Fred Astaire and specifically references the \\"Bojangles of Harlem sequence\\" in which Astaire sports blackface. Jeni Le Gon becomes an icon for the narrator and Tracey after they see her dancing in Ali Baba Goes to Town. In a scene in the novel the narrator and Aimee go to Kenwood House where the narrator mentions, without naming her, Dido Elizabeth Belle and the portrait of her with her cousin Lady Elizabeth Murray. In another scene the narrator is taken to see Chris Marker‚Äôs 1983 documentary film Sans Soleil by her boyfriend Rakim. The novel references Smith's debut novel White Teeth as the narrator briefly mentions going to school with Irie (Irie Jones) who, like the narrator has a Jamaican mother. Reception The novel received mostly positive reviews. Taiye Selasi writing for The Guardian called it Smith's \\"finest\\" novel yet. Ron Charles of The Washington Post dubbed it \\"a big social novel nimble enough to keep all its diverse parts moving gracefully toward a vision of what really matters in this life when the music stops.\\" Holly Bass of The New York Times criticized the \\"unsympathetic\\" narrator. Sadiya Ansari writing for the Toronto Star had similar criticisms, disliking the narrator's tendency \\"to just float\\". The Irish Times critic John Boyne was much harsher, criticizing the novel for \\"lacking a consistent narrative drive, an interesting voice or a compelling point of view\\".

In Regieoper, the stage director assumes a central role in determining the concept of an opera, often exchanging the established traditions related to that opera for an approach that may or may not adhere to the composer's or librettist's original intention. The director's approach may include but is not limited to changing the staging intended by the composer or librettist, modernizing the story to reflect contemporary political controversies, and infusing the production with shock value (most often, sexuality).  History  The roots of Regieoper can be traced back to Swiss stage director and designer Adolphe Appia. Appia was a scene design painter who most famously collaborated with Richard Wagner to create the sets for some of his original productions. Aided by the invention of electricity, Appia used light and shade in new ways to create the illusion of three-dimensional sets. He combined color with dynamic light intensity to create a new perspective of scene design and stage lighting. As Adolf Aber sums up, \\"The whole aim of such a production is‚Äîas Appia points out‚Äîto get the actor, as the true bearer of the drama, back into the centre of the action\\". Appia sought to create this affect through the \\"subtle art of lighting on the stage\\", however his philosophy of actor-centric theater served as inspiration for Wagner's grandson, Wieland Wagner when he directed Wagner's operas at Bayreuth festival in the 1950s and 1960s. As a director, Wieland's manifestation of this philosophy birthed the theatrical aesthetic of Regieoper. The role of the director in opera originally arose from the need for a person to fulfill administrative duties. This person primarily dealt with \\"artistic planning and casting, (in consultation with the composer, if still living) and nominally oversaw all rehearsals and performances\\". However, the importance of the director as an artistic visionary became increasingly more prominent over the 20th century. Inspired by the vision of Appia's work and the way it complemented Wagner's philosophy of Gesamtkunstwerk, Wieland Wagner mounted minimalistic productions that strove to highlight the psychological interactions of the character by setting the drama on a mostly bare and stark stage. Wieland Wagner's approach was met with much criticism and controversy, however after his death in 1966 other theater directors latched on to the philosophy and it became an influential and controversial directorial style in the late twentieth century.  Examples  Willy Decker's 2005 Salzburg production of Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata, is a fairly tame example of Regieoper. The original story is set in the early 19th century, with opulent sets, and party scenes with both men and women enjoying high society frivolity. Although Violetta is aware of her illness and possible impending death, she mainly concerns herself with flaunting high society rules and dreaming of a life of bliss with her lover, Rudolfo, in the country. Decker has updated the story to modern times with a set consisting of only a blue wall and a sofa, desk, and a chair. The chorus is androgynously dressed in tuxedos, rendering them rather dark and menacing. The only women are Violetta and her maid. The most striking change is the giant clock on a wall with the figure of Violetta's doctor in black hovering at the side of the stage throughout the opera. Clearly, Decker's concept was to change the emphasis from a courtesan trying to find love, to the idea of Death being a constant reminder of our mortality. Even with these changes, however, the original intent and flow of the libretto and Verdi's incomparable music remained. A somewhat more radical approach to Regieoper can be seen in Philipp Himmelmann's 2004 Berlin production of Verdi's Don Carlo. The original plot, which takes place in the mid-1500s, is complicated; weaving elements of personal, political, and theological conflicts, but usually centering on the love conflict between Spain's King Phillip II, his son Don Carlo, and Elizabeth, whom they both desire. Since the Spanish Inquisition is an integral part of the plot, a particularly dramatic scene involves an auto-da-f√©. Himmelmann has updated the action, sets, and costumes, giving it a spare and modern look. Most of the action takes place around a dining table against a dark background. The director seems to have added elements that are meant to simply shock. Princess Eboli's Ladies in Waiting have become secret agents who attach silencers to handguns and point them at the audience. During the auto- da-f√© scene, nude bodies lie in front of the family table, then are trussed up with rope, hoisted up to the ceiling, and dowsed with gasoline, all while the family goes about their business. As the publication \\"Mostly Opera\\" says, \\"The entire concept revolves around Fillipo's dysfunctional family. One of the major strengths of this production is the visualization of the division between the private and public lives of this modern royal family, as we observe them in both private and public functions\\". At the extreme end of the \\"shock\\" spectrum lies Calixto Bieito's 2004 Berlin production of Mozart's Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail. This opera has had many incarnations, even delving into the realm of parody, as evidenced by director Josh Shaw's 2015 production for the Pacific Opera Project wherein the opera is set as a Star Trek episode with tenor Brian Cheney in the starring role as Captain James T. Belmonte. Bieto's production, though, is considered to be the most radically shocking to date. The inspiration for Mozart's opera was the overwhelming fascination of Europeans by all things Turkish. Orientalist elements abound in this story of a hero trying to rescue two girls from the clutches of an evil Pasha who has installed them in his harem, Seraglio. Instead of a genteel harem, Bieto has set this Abduction in a modern, garish bordello where men and women engage in extreme acts of sex and brutality. The sets consist mainly of whorehouse accoutrements, the lighting is colored and garish, and the costumes for the most part are leather pants and bras with a smattering of sexy dressing gowns. In one scene, Osmin seems to cut off a woman's nipple with a knife, in another he forces a woman to drink a cup of urine. Towards the end of the opera, a body appears to be dismembered. Although Bieto seems to add these elements mainly to shock and dismay, he is a director known for trying to express difficult issues, such as sex used as brutality, in a manner that would speak to modern audiences. In this case, it may be effective, but absolutely nothing is left of Mozart's original vision except his divine music.  Critical reception  Many Regie productions are met with critical disdain, as their shocking nature is often perceived as \\"pandering\\" to an audience. While these jolting qualities generate publicity and scandal, many critics feel the trend will eventually hurt opera's place in society. Critic Heather Mac Donald calls Regietheater, \\"one of the most depressing artistic developments of our time; it suggests a culture that cannot tolerate its own legacy of beauty and nobility.\\" Early in their careers, directors like the Alden brothers and Peter Sellars were considered the \\"enfant terribles who emphasized modern dress, striking visuals and visceral theatricality, and had little to do with the company,\\" and thus were ignored by large mainstream institutions, like the Metropolitan Opera. However, as opera companies strive to develop larger audiences, Regie productions are making their way into larger opera houses. This trend is what gives critics like MacDonald pause about opera's future. \\"The list of tone-deaf self-indulgences could be extended indefinitely. Their trashy sex and disjunctive settings are just the symptom, however, of a deeper malady. The most insidious problem with Regietheater is the directors' hatred of Enlightenment values. Where a composer writes lightness and joy, they find a 'subtext' of darkness.\\" Directors, like David Alden, are often the center of similar critical disdain. Rupert Christiansen calls Alden's production of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades, \\"relentlessly pretentious but largely rubbishy.\\" While James Tarmy laments Aldens' production of Un ballo in maschera is \\"as seductive as an airport parking lot.\\" Tarmy also comments on the expectations that coincide with a Regie director's work, saying, \\"I expected a lot from David Alden, a director who once turned Tchaikovsky's Mazeppa into a chainsaw massacre‚Äî What a frustrating night, right until the end when Anckarstrom stabbed Gustavo at the masked ball. Gustavo fell, got up, strolled around a bit, then dropped again for his last addio.\\" While critics like Mac Donald, Christiansen, and Tarmy view Regietheater as an abomination, other critics feel concept opera is part of a rich, spectacle driven legacy. Chris Mullins calls Alden's production of Ercole Amante \\"a show that respects the opera's most sincere moments while teasing the opera's titular hero and his less than heroic shenanigans right up to the edges of parody,\\" Mullins feels strongly the composer's original intention for theatrical spectacle is echoed in Alden's concept.

In the 2015 FIFA World Cup, Ecuador finished last, only scoring one goal. Although most federations might have fired the couch after a score that low, especially a female coach. Surprisingly the federation retained Arauz for the women's national program at all levels. By 2017, she was coaching all women's teams for the federation and was named an official instructor by CONMEBOL. In that position, Arauz travelled to provide assistance and training to women's programs throughout South America. Through the efforts of the federation, Arauz proved to be the face of change within Latin America and women's rights, specifically within football.

It was actually built thrice. The earlier temples , referred to as A and B, were built in the 7th and 6th centuries BC respectively and were made of porous stone; a third temple was built of limestone in the 4th century BC, although it is not certain that it actually was dedicated to Athena this time. Description Reconstitution of the site thumb280pxPlan of the Temple of Athena Pronaia in Delphi. 1 Temple of Athena Pronaia 2 Newer temple (of Athena Pronaia?) 3 Tholos 4 Treasury of Massilians and Romans 5 Doric Treasury 6 Temenos of heroes 7 Altar of Athena Pronaia 8 Altar of Hygieia and Eileithyia 9 Unidentified archaic altar 10 Unidentified building (for priests?) 11 Statue base for the statue of emperor Hadrian? 12 Eastern entrance 13 Southern entrance The sanctuary of Athena \\"Pronaia\\" (also spelled Pronaea, meaning 'the one before' the temple of Apollo), was the first one met by the visitor who came to Delphi on foot from the eastern road, hence its name. Excavations have proved that at this spot lay an older cult site, possibly dedicated to Gaia (i.e., the Earth). Most of the Mycenaean figurines exhibited in the Delphi Archaeological Museum, including the notable seated figure on a tripod, were discovered here, and it has been suggested that they were ex-votos. =Temple A= The first temple dedicated to Athena was made of grey-shaded porous stone and was constructed in the 7th century BC. It was probably the earliest Doric temple, of which twelve columns have been preserved, along with the foundations and the crepidoma and stylobate. The columns were crowned by low capitals and bore shallow flutings. In the first half of the 6th century BC, this temple was destroyed, possibly by an earthquake.Demangel, G., Daux, G.,(1923), Le sanctuaire d'Ath√©na Pronaia, Fasc.I: Les temples de tuf, Paris =Temple B= After the destruction of temple A another temple, now called temple B, was erected on the same spot. The date of its construction is estimated at c. 510 BC, and it probably formed part of the building program of the Alcmaeonids for the restoration of the monuments of Delphi. This second temple (13.25 √ó 27.46 m) was also made of porous stone. It did not have an opisthodomos; its pteron consisted of 12 columns on the long sides and 6 columns on the narrow ones. Its metopes were made of clay, decorated with figures; the pediments and acroteria also bore figures, such as Athena (pediment) and Nike (side acroteria). The temple was excavated towards the end of the \\"Grande Fouille\\". Fifteen columns were still standing in 1905, when a rock fall destroyed them. Scholars think that perhaps this second temple was never actually destroyed or abandoned but continued to function after the construction of the third temple. The marble fragments of a head of Athena discovered and displayed now at the museum are attributed to the cult statue of Athena, which would have been situated in the cella of the temple.Demangel, G., Daux, G.,(1923), Le sanctuaire d'Ath√©na Pronaia, Fasc.I: Les temples de tuf, Paris =Temple C= The Tholos of Delphi in the Temple of Athena Pronaia, 370‚Äì360 BCE The third temple, built of limestone in the 4th century BC, was possibly not dedicated to Athena but rather to Artemis. Scholars are led to this supposition by the testimony of Pausanias, who mentions that one of the temples in the sanctuary of Pronaea was dedicated to Artemis.Pausanias, 10.8.6 However, the traditional view remains in favour of Athena. The date of its construction is approximated to 360 BC, and it was located at the west of the terrace supporting the entire complex of the \\"Marmaria\\". Although only the foundations are extant, its plan has been fully restored: It was based on a crepidoma consisting of three levels and had a prostyle in antis consisting of six columns on the fa√ßade. It also had a cella and a vestibule. The cella was separated from the pronaos by a gate in the Ionian order. Along the rear wall were arrayed statues on bases, possibly some of a later date. It seems that the temple bore no sculpted decoration, with the exception of the acroteria, which have not, however, been preserved. A possible reason therefore could be that the temple lay very close to the tholos, built a couple of decades earlier and bearing a striking decoration, so the architect of temple C wanted to create a contrast. Pausanias describes the temple in the 2nd century: : \\"When you enter the city [of Delphoi] you see temples in a row. The first of them was in ruins . . . the fourth is called the temple of Athena Pronoia (Forethought). Of its two images, the one in the fore-temple is a votive offering of the Massiliots, and is larger than the one inside the temple. The Massiliots are a colony of Phokaia in Ionia . . . The votive offering of the Massiliots is of bronze. The gold shield given to Athena Pronoia by Kroisos the Lydian was said by the Delphians to have been stolen by Philomelos.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 10. 8. 6 (trans. Jones) The temple could not have functioned to a later date than the 4th or 5th century, when all pagan shrines were closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.

She was a professed religious of the now- extinct Congregation of Dilette of Jesus and served as the foundress of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Verona. Naudet served in the court of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and after his death served his daughter Maria Anna who became an abbess and professed religious alongside Naudet and her sister. Naudet was noted for her strong devotion to the education of females and assigned her order to the moral and civic education of all girls in Verona where her order was based in. She focused on religious values in the curriculum that her order provided and also devoted herself to the precepts of her order that would receive papal approval months before her death. She was proclaimed to be Venerable on 6 July 2007 after Pope Benedict XVI recognized that Naudet had lived a model life of heroic virtue. Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to her intercession on 21 December 2016 and her beatification was celebrated on 29 April 2017 in Verona. Life Leopoldina Naudet was born in Florence in 1773 as the eldest daughter of Giuseppe Naudet and Susanna von Arnth. Her father was French, and a senior official at the court of Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Her mother was the daughter of an Austrian officer. Susanna Naudet died in 1778 and Leopoldina was entrusted to the Nuns of St. Frediano in Florence.In 1783, she went to Soissons to furthered her education with the Sisters of Notre Dame. Naudet returned to Florence in 1789, at the age of sixteen and became a teacher of Grand Duke Leopold's children.Valerio, Adriana. \\"Biblical Inspiration in the Transformations of women's Religious Communities in the Nineteenth Century\\", Faith and Feminism in Nineteenth-Century Religious Communities, (Michaela Sohn-Kronthaler, Ruth Albrecht, eds.), SBL Press, 2019, p. 168 et seq. She became to close their daughter Archduchess Maria Anna. In 1790, Leopold became Holy Roman Emperor. Naudet and her sister Luisa joined the Imperial Consort Maria Louisa when Leopold's court moved to Vienna. In 1791, Archduchess Maria Anna became Abbess of the Chapter of Nuns of St. George's Convent, Prague. Naudet held positions of trust in the institute known as the Beloved of Jesus to which she committed herself in collaboration with the Archduchess. She entered Maria Anna's direct service in 1792 following the death of the Emperor. While in Prague, Naudet had as her spiritual director Father Nicholas Diessbach. She also came into contact with Father Niccol√≤ Paccanari and she favored the Congregation of Dilette of Jesus that he himself had established; the two also worked in the Beloved of Jesus. Naudet took with her Maria Anna and Luisa on 31 May 1799 to make their temporary consecration as professed religious; Naudet renewed it a week later as perpetual vows that bound her to the apostolic life. In 1800 she travelled to Padua where she met with Pope Pius VII who encouraged her work in the field of education. She visited Padua, Loreto and Venice. In February 1801 she arrived in Rome where she was appointed superior of the Congregation of Dilette of Jesus but the order suffered a fatal split that saw French members establish the Congregation of the Ladies of the Sacred Heart while Naudet had a few members still remain with her; this split also tarnished the relationship between Naudet and Father Paccanari who had fallen into disgrace due to this. Naudet - as a result of the split - moved to Verona where she became a collaborator of Magdalene of Canossa who was the founder of the Daughters of Charity. The pair collaborated from 1808 to 1816. Naudet desired to devote her life to the education of girls and in 1816 established the Sisters of the Holy Family in the former convent of Saint Teresa in Verona. She found great assistance in Gaspar Bertoni as well as other figures like Louis Fusari (the superior of the Oratorian Priests in Verona) and John Rozaven. She focused the curriculum of her congregation to the civic and moral education for girls in addition to their religious formation and she was known to demonstrate apostolic ardor; she was also noted for her active life simultaneous to a contemplative life. She also focused the curriculum on drawing and languages such as French and English; she also focused on catechism and economics. On 23 December 1833 the order was approved following the papal approval of Pope Gregory XVI. Naudet died on 17 August 1834 in Verona; her final words: \\"I want only what God wills!\\" Her remains were transferred in 1958 to the Mother House of her congregation. Beatification process The beatification proceedings commenced in Verona on 8 June 1971 under Pope Paul VI in a diocesan process that spanned until 24 April 1973. The commencement of the cause in 1971 designated Naudet with the posthumous title Servant of God. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the process in Rome on 7 January 1994 and would later accept the Positio in 1996. This marked the beginning of the \\"Roman Phase\\" in which the Congregation would evaluate the work of the diocesan process. The cause was relegated to the historical commission; the historians approved the continuation of the cause on 5 November 1996. Naudet was proclaimed to be Venerable on 6 July 2007 after Pope Benedict XVI approved the fact that Naudet had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue which he deemed she exercised to a favorable degree. The miracle needed for her beatification was investigated on a local level and was validated on 12 May 2006. The Rome-based medical board advising the Congregation for the Causes of Saints granted their approval to the healing as being a miracle on 3 July 2014 in what was an affirmative vote.

His work constituted a precious aid to travelers and archaeologists who attempted to identify the monuments revealed by the excavations, although in some cases their identifications were not enough. Pausanias A traveler and geographer of the 2nd century A.D. Pausanias was most probably born in Lydia (Asia Minor) and wrote a very important work, the Description of Greece. It is a lengthy and detailed itinerary in ten books, describing the most important sites of the Peloponnese, Attica, Boeotia and Phocis. According to the famous classicist James Frazer who wrote on Pausanias, \\"without him the ruins of Greece would be a labyrinth without a clue, a riddle without an answer\\".Fraser, J.G. (1898), Pausanias' Description of Greece, ed.and tr., London He was mainly interested in monuments (particularly sculpture and painting) as well as their historical framework and the cults. The tenth book As in the rest of his books in his description of Delphi Pausanias describes rituals, rites, customs and offers narrations with a historical and ethnographic background. Delphi are described in 38 chapters. The limit of his itinerary was the land of the Ozolian Locrians. The book was probably accomplished between 143 and 161 A.D. The detailed description of Pausanias was valuable to later scholarship and to the attempts at reconstructing the site. Although the treasures of Delphi had been looted by the Phoceans initially and by Roman emperors such as Nero later on, in Pausanias' times there were still enough monuments to admire and describe. He focuses on religious art and architecture. He is very detailed on the narration of the Oedipus myth, on the foundation of the oracle and temple of Apollo, on the Pythian Games and on the description of the ex votos. He also writes about historical events related to Delphi as well as about mythical events and scenes. Of particular interest and value is the description of the Iliou Persis (Fall of Troy), the painting by Polygnotus which used to decorate the Lesche of the Cnidians. He describes in detail the composition and many attempts at modern reconstructions have been based on this description. The description of the site of Delphi has the following structure: =Sanctuary of Athena Pronaia= Pausanias mentions that in the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia existed three temples (two of them empty of ex votos and statues), as well as a fourth one with a few statues of Roman emperors. He also mentions the Treasury of the Massaliots but, strangely enough, he does not mention the Tholos of Delphi, which had suffered damage from a fire in the 1st century B.C. nor the Doric Treasury. He also mentions that next to the sanctuary lay a temple dedicated to the local hero Phylakos. Yet, the picture which emerged from the excavations does not converge with Pausanias' testimony. For several years this divergence puzzled the scholars until in 1985 Didier Laroche proposed a new reading of Pausanias. This new interpretation was based on the fact that Pausanias followed a different itinerary than the usual one, whereas the Tholos could be \\"the temple hosting small number of portraits of Roman Emperors\\". In general, the picture offered by Pausanias is that of a sanctuary in decline, with buildings that did not attract large number of visitors and was generally not very well kept (a fact stressed also by Plutarch who mentions that in his days the funds of the sanctuary were limited and thus the conservation and repair works were few and far between). =The Gymnasium and Castalia fountain= Pausanias refers to the Gymnasium, but he seems to be particularly interested in the myths related to the fountain Castalia and to the abundant waters of the region in general. =The sanctuary of Apollo= The ex voto of Phayllos of Croton from Croton (the base of the ex voto of the Crotoniats) mentioned by Pausanias was identified for years with the preserved base with an inscription mentioning the Crotoniats, but it has been proved now that this base belonged to another ex voto offered by the citizens of Croton for their victory over the Sybarites (510 B.C.). The Bull of the Corcyreans was a large bronze ex voto of the citizens of Corfu in orde to thank the god for an enormous catch of tuna fish made possible through a bull which averted them. He then goes on to describe the base of the Arcadians for their victory against the Lacaedemonians, the monument of Lysandros, the Lacaedemonian general for his victory against Athens, an impressive ex voto with the Dioskouroi, several gods, Lysandros himself, Agias who was his counsellor and some of his allies. Pausanias also mentions that the Athenians, with the tithe from the booty of the Battle of Marathon, had dedicated an ex voto comprising the statues of Athena, Apollo, Miltiades and the mythical kings of Athens. Similar was also the ex voto of the Argives, which comprised their leaders who had followed Polynikes at the war of the Seven against Thebes. Then, Pausanias mentions the base of the Tarentines, who had dedicated bronze horses and statues of women in captivity, in order to commemorate their victory against the Messapians. He goes on to describe the Treasuries, starting from the Treasury of the Sicyonians and continuing with the Treasury of the Siphnians, the Thebans, the Athenians and the Cnidians. In between he describes also the base of the sculpted ex voto of the Cnidians as well as the ex voto of the Lipareans. It is obvious that he was mostly attracted by sculpture and less by architecture. However, he is most detailed in his description of the Portico of the Athenians, whereas he pays special mention to the Rock of Sibyl. In chapters 14 and 15 he returns to his favourite sculpture, enumerating several statues which would nowadays be completely unknown, among which Apollo of Salamis and the statue of Phryne, made by Praxiteles. He then writes about the omphalos, which he describes made of white marble. It is, however, not very clear which is actually the omphalos he describes. He includes a series of smaller statues and ex votos, also lost today. After a lengthy narration of the attacks of the Gauls against Delphi, he goes on to describe the temple of Apollo. He describes the representations on the pediments and the interior of the temple, speaking about the altar of Poseidon. Very detailed is also the description of the Lesche of the Cnidians and particularly, as mentioned above, of the painting of the \\"Capture of Troy\\" by Polygnotus. Finally, Pausanias refers to the Stadium and the Theatre of Delphi, with which he finished the description of the sanctuary.

The objective of the trial was to identify whether, in patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 130 mm Hg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk, but without diabetes, treating to a systolic blood pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg is superior to a target of 140 mm Hg. The primary outcome being measured was myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. The study implies that patients receiving \\"standard\\" therapy were controlled similarly to all adults being treated for hypertension and that patients receiving \\"intensive\\" therapy had a lower mean SBP compared to all adults being treated for hypertension, but neither conclusion is true when compared to the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. During the study, 9361 patients were randomly assigned to either a 140 mm Hg target (referred to in the study as standard treatment) or a 120 mm Hg target (intensive treatment). Patients were prescribed blood pressure reducing medications to reach their assigned goal. Unlike normal hypertension treatment, once the goal was reached, prescriptions were suspended until the patient was no longer at goal. After being followed up for a median of 3.26 years, the study showed a significantly lower rate of the primary outcome in the intensive treatment group (1.65% per year) compared to the standard treatment group (2.19% per year). The risk of experiencing a primary outcome (myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes) was 25% lower than in the standard treatment group, and the risk of death from any cause was 27% lower. The number needed to treat with intensive therapy instead of standard therapy to prevent one death was 90. The results were so much more superior for the intensive treatment group that the trial was stopped early. Although the trial showed that intensive treatment was associated with lower rates of cardiovascular events and death, intensive treatment was also associated with 4% higher rates of serious adverse effects from anti-hypertensive medications, including syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, acute kidney injury or acute renal failure. However, this association was not statistically significant, with a P-value of 0.25, and therefore may have occurred by chance. The intensive treatment group were not found to be at a greater risk of injurious falls or bradycardia, and orthostatic hypotension was less common in the intensive treatment group.

Of approximately 150 people on board the two trains, 12 people died and 85 others were injured, including 24 seriously. Two months after the accident, investigators announced that it had been caused by the responsible Deutsche Bahn train dispatcher who gave incorrect orders to the two trains while distracted by a game he was playing on his mobile phone.Dispatcher Playing With Cellphone Is Faulted in German Train Crash 13 April 2016 The dispatcher further compounded his error when, realizing it, he tried to send emergency codes to the trains but entered the wrong combination into his computer. Accident Location of the disaster ET 325, the eastbound train, photographed in 2014 The collision occurred at 06:46:56 CET (05:46:56 UTC) on the single-track Mangfall Valley Railway () on a curve between the stations of Kolbermoor and Bad Aibling-Kurpark close to the Bad Aibling sewage works in Bavaria. , a total of 11 people had died, including several railway employees. In total 85 people were injured; 24 injured seriously and 61 injured less seriously. A twelfth victim died from his injuries two months after the accident. The two trains were Stadler 3 multiple-units, operated under the Meridian brand by the Bayerische Oberlandbahn (BOB), a subsidiary of Transdev Germany. The eastbound train was a six-car unit with 333 seats (ET 325), scheduled to run from Munich to Rosenheim, while the westbound train was a three-car unit with 158 seats (ET 355), scheduled to run from Rosenheim to Holzkirchen. There were more than 150 passengers on board the two trains, considerably fewer than usual because of Carnival Holidays. The trains were equipped with a total of three train event recorders. The line and both trains were equipped with the Punktf√∂rmige Zugbeeinflussung (PZB) train protection system, which was designed to reinforce line-side signalling and prevent drivers from accidentally passing signals at danger. The eastbound and westbound trains were scheduled to pass each other at Kolbermoor railway station, with the westbound train () towards the direction of Munich timetabled to wait for five minutes for the eastbound train from Munich () to arrive. The westbound train departed Kolbermoor on schedule but the eastbound train was four minutes behind schedule. One train was travelling at and the other at . =Rescue operation= One of the less- damaged carriages Emergency engineering train ready for operation in Kolbermoor The rescue operation involved a total of approximately 700 emergency service workers, including 180 firefighters, 215 Bavarian State Police officers, 50 Federal Police officers, 30 federal civil protection employees of Technisches Hilfswerk, and 200 rescuers from the Bavarian Red Cross, including Water Rescue and Mountain Rescue units. A total of 11 helicopters took part in the rescue efforts. Air ambulances from both Germany and Austria were used to transport the injured to hospitals. The site of the accident was difficult to reach because it lies between the Stuckenholz forest and the canalised Mangfall river ('). This made rescue work considerably more difficult because rescue workers had to be transported by boat and casualty extraction supported by air ambulance. Injured people were extracted by boat to the opposite bank of the river. =Recovery operation= On 9 February 2016, two breakdown cranes belonging to the DB Netze Emergency Technical department (') were dispatched from Fulda and Leipzig to assist in recovery and removal of the two damaged trains. The crane from Fulda is capable of lifting 160 tonnes, and the second crane from Leipzig is capable of lifting 75 tonnes. =Reaction= German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt visited the site of the accident. He said it was a \\"horrifying sight\\". Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said that it was \\"difficult to comprehend\\" how the accident happened. Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was \\"dismayed and saddened\\" by the crash. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier stated: \\"My deepest sympathy goes to their families.\\" Minister-President of Bavaria Horst Seehofer said \\"The whole of Bavaria has been shaken\\". As a result of the accident, the carnival celebrations on Shrove Tuesday in Rosenheim, Bad Aibling and the surrounding area were cancelled. The traditional political debates on Ash Wednesday in Lower Bavaria were called off. Investigations Dispatch office of Bad Aibling railway station, which is also in operation as a signalling centre for the railway stations in Kolbermoor, Heufeld and Bad Aibling-Kurpark The German Rail Accident Investigation Agency (', EUB) opened investigation number 04/2016 into the accident. The German police opened a separate investigation. Police confirmed that nine of the eleven deaths had been identified as being local men from the districts of Rosenheim and Traunstein aged 24‚Äì59. The cause of this accident was unclear. By the evening of 9 February 2016, Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt reported that two of the trains' three train event recorders had been recovered. The third was still located in one of the wedged train carriages. On 12 February it was announced that the third event recorder had been recovered. Police said that the recorder was damaged, but attempts would be made to extract the data. Data from the other two recorders had thus far provided no indication of human error on the part of the train crew. In a press conference on 16 February 2016, the local prosecutor (Staatsanwalt) identified \\"human error\\" as the cause of the crash. A train dispatcher at the signalling centre in Bad Aibling had given a wrong instruction. German investigators said they found no evidence of mechanical failure or technical defects that would have caused the crash. The dispatcher was also charged with gef√§hrlicher Eingriff in den Bahnverkehr (dangerous interference with railroads), which is punishable with up to ten years' imprisonment. Zs 1 subsidiary signal Many German railway main signals are equipped with an additional subsidiary signal called \\"Zs 1\\" (shown as three white dots in a triangle shape). This subsidiary signal replaces a written order authorising a train driver to pass the signal while it is showing a stop aspect. The train dispatcher can activate it from the signal box. There are no safety controls in the signal box, other than special operating rules, for the dispatcher to activate a Zs 1 signal. When a Zs 1 subsidiary signal is shown to the train driver, he must press and hold the PZB button \\"Befehl\\" (\\"Order\\") in the cab while moving the train over an active 2000-Hz emergency stop inductor located at the main signal. A warning tone sounds in the cab to acknowledge to the driver that he is pressing the Written Order button. If in a station the Zs 1 signal is the last signal, after the complete train has passed the stop signal and any following points(at a speed not exceeding ), the driver may continue with normal speed. The Zs 1 subsidiary signal is supposed to be used only in circumstances when a route for a train cannot be set. There are sections in the rulebook on how and when it may be activated safely, but according to the local prosecutor, these rules were not adhered to. In April 2016 it was revealed that the dispatcher had been playing a game on his mobile phone at the time. After realising he had made an error, allowing both trains to proceed, he dialled an incorrect number when trying to issue an emergency call. No technical fault existed with either the trains or the signalling system. With these new findings the prosecutors reversed their initial assumption of Augenblicksversagen (lapse of attention) turning it into a charge of Pflichtverletzung (breach of obligations), which carries a heavier penalty ‚Äì as a result an arrest warrant was issued, and the train dispatcher was held in pre-trial detention from 12 April 2016. The prosecutors brought the charges to the court in Traunstein in mid July 2016 with accusations on twelve accounts of fahrl√§ssige T√∂tung (involuntary manslaughter, i.e. murder by negligence) and 89 accounts of fahrl√§ssige K√∂rperverletzung (involuntary battery, i.e. injury by negligence). The main trial was scheduled for seven days between 10 November and 5 December 2016. On the first day of trial the defendant confessed to the charges brought by the prosecutors, but his lawyer wanted the degree of guilt to be evaluated during the subsequent proceedings - although he showed a degree of compassion for the victims, the defendant refused to answer questions on the intensity of his preoccupation with the mobile game. The expert witness from the EUB investigation board had shown in court that the documentation for the interlocking section () was outdated, slightly incorrect and did not contain directions for the emergency radio. Nevertheless, the actual interlocking setup was logical and fully functional in a way that an experienced train dispatcher could handle correctly. The defendant, however, had not followed general guidelines for problem handling - if he had double-checked the existing routes () on the signal box panel, then he should have easily spotted the route set for the train from Kolbermoor that was automatically blocking the exit signal for Bad Aibling. Nor did he radio to the train driver to proceed slowly under the unusual circumstances. The original error had occurred somewhat earlier, however: with one of the trains running late, he chose to move the train crossing from Kolbermoor to Bad Aibling by juggling some of the signals. With a delay of only four minutes, however, this action was not allowed. The court ruled on 5 December that he was guilty on all of the charges, and he was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. The verdict is final as the lawyers of Michael P (40) renounced any appeal a week later. In July 2018 he was released on probation after having served two-thirds of the prison sentence. This had been already expected shortly after the conviction as it is in accordance with German law (¬ß57 StGB). A preliminary report was published by the German investigation agency on 7 March 2017. The report stated that the infrastructure was fully functional, but that some documentation was slightly outdated (for example, an unused GSM-R radio infill station was listed). The reconstructed timeline showed that an emergency call was first initiated 35 seconds before the crash, but to the wrong emergency call group. The emergency code for track workers had been selected twice (code 569, \\"Trackside maintenance groups: High- priority call\\", \\"\\", labelled \\"\\") instead of the general GSM-R emergency number (code 299, \\"Train groups: Emergency call\\", \\"\\", labelled \\"\\"). The final investigation report was published on 29 October 2018. =Timeline= The exit signal at Bad Aibling Kurpark. On the day of the accident three white dots below the red lamp allowed the train to pass it The reconstructed timeline shows that the westbound train 79506 entered the section to Kolbermoor at 6:37. The first action in the following series of events occurred at 6:38 when the train dispatcher set the signals for the train allowing both entry to Kolbermoor station as well as allowing exit towards Bad Aibling. The westbound train reached the station at 6:40. The train was supposed to wait till 6:45 at the platform for the eastbound train to arrive. The eastbound train 79505 arrives at Bad Aibling station at 6:42. Since the exit signal at Kolbermoor was set to passing, the signal box did block the single track section to Bad Aibling for this train. Nethertheless the train dispatcher tried to set the exit signal for the eastbound train from Bad Aibling towards Kolbermoor. He resolved the situation by assuming a technical error using the replacement signal \\"order\\" at 6:43 for the exit signal at the station and another replacement signal at the following station at 6:45. Now both trains were clear to enter the single-track section in opposite direction. The eastbound train leaves Bad Aibling station at 6:43:38. The time was taken from the train recorder as the train passes over an active PZB inductor at the signal at danger. The westbound train 79506 at Kolbermoor waits for the regular departure time leaving the station at 06:45:02. The train recorder of the eastbound train 79505 showed a stop at 06:45:14 in Bad Aibling Kurpark quickly continuing on the single-track section. The signal at danger at Bad Aibling Kurpark was recorded at 06:45:46 (see picture). Shortly later the train dispatcher recognized the situation with both trains showing up on the same track whereas the train drivers can not see each other due to a curve near the Bad Aibling sewage works. At 06:46:20 an emergency signal was radioed by the train dispatcher received by other workers but not the train drivers. Both train recorders show an emergency break at 06:46:55, only a second before the crash. At the emergency break the train travelled at 56 km/h and 92 km/h respectively. The last entries on the train recorders at 06:46:56 show a remaining speed of 52 km/h and 87 km/h. The energy supply for the overhead catenary was automatically shut down at 6:47:02 assumed from a short circuit.  Recommendations  The investigation report issued in 2017 recommended that the menu options on GSM-R terminals should be altered, so that after pressing the emergency button, only a single menu option would be available. This single menu item would combine the track maintaince emergency (code 569) and train emergency (code 299) functions. The existence of two emergency functions comes from the general GSM-R standard to define only an emergency code for trains. In order to allow track workers to continue to warn a train dispatcher (about an obstacle they found) Deutsche Bahn did not try to alter the EU-wide harmonized standard but they asked for a second channel at the national regulator (Eisenbahnbundesamt) which was approved. That way the previous non- digital handheld phones could be replaced by new ones step by step. As a result, track workers and train drivers do have only one emergency channel, it is just the train dispatcher to have two. The final investigation report issued in 2018 added a few more recommendations. The investigators had asked the Technical University of Braunschweig to assess the psychological environment. The scientific report has been attached to the final report. The researchers noted that the official rule book contains no section how to do an initial analysis in case of operational interruptions (unlike Switzerland which had reorganized the rule book in the 1990s adding a chapter on ‚ÄûKernprozess St√∂rungen‚Äú) whereas the required steps are spread out over different sections relating to the railway functions. The training for train dispatchers should also include hints for correct behaviour in times of mental underload.

The organization serves the rural areas of India with its unique approach for sustainable and comprehensive community driven integrated development program, under the aegis of the Chinmaya Mission. While holding the directorship of CORD India, she also serves as an adviser to CORD USA, the US wing of the Organization. A recipient of several awards including the Guardian International Development Achievement Award of 2012, she was selected as the Woman of the Year by The Week magazine, in 1993. The Government of India awarded her the fourth highest civilian honor of the Padma Shri, in 2008, for her contributions to society.  Biography  Sidhbari village, Himachal Pradesh Kshama Metre was born on 25 June 1950 to geologist Wamanrao Bapuji Metre and Shantabai Metre at Nagpur in the western Indian state of Maharashtra but spent her early years in Assam. Moving to Delhi, she did her schooling at The Frank Anthony Public School before graduating in medicine (MBBS) from Maulana Azad Medical College and secured her post graduate degree (MD) in pediatrics from the same institution. Later, she did her senior residency at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, Delhi and set up her practice in the city. It was during this time, she met Chinmayananda Saraswati, a spiritual leader and educationist; the meeting is reported to have influenced her to abandon medical practice and join the Chinmaya Mission to assist in their work in the rural areas of the country. In 1985, leaving behind her life in New Delhi, she went to Sidhbari, a village in Himachal Pradesh, and set up six health centres for women and children and a community health training centre for nurses. The movement gathered momentum in due course and evolved into Chinmaya Organisation of Rural Development (CORD), with Metre becoming the founding National Director of the organization. Under her leadership, CORD operates in over 900 villages and has formed self-help groups (Mahila Mandals) and introduced microfinancing facilities through the groups. In 2003, Chinmaya Mission's rural development activities were combined under the umbrella of CORD. The organization has had a strong focus on Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, where it started, along with some presence in the neighboring districts. To leverage its long term in-depth experience in its core area of operation, starting 2005, it expanded its activities with satellite units in the states of Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand. She has also focused on social issues like HIV/AIDS, substance abuse and discriminative treatment of women and her efforts are reported behind setting up of social forums where law and order issues could be settled without the interference of Police. Metre's activities have been supported by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) which extended finance for the microfinancing of the Mahila Mandals. The system initiated by her covers 1490 self-help groups, 75 children's groups, 220 men's groups and several girls' groups and is active in community health programs, rehabilitation programs for disabled people, legal aid programs, and livelihood support programs. Her efforts gained her a nomination to the now defunct Planning Commission of India in 2007 for a five-year term that lasted till 2012 where she was a member of the work group which focused on primary healthcare. She has written several articles on rural healthcare and development; some of them getting accepted by Changemakers, a networking platform for social entrepreneurship. Her group of volunteers have trained over 40,000 people in the management of rural development, representing government and banking institutions, non government organizations and self-help group (SHG) members. In 2015, with the increasing demand for such training, a new facility for CORD Training Center was opened in Sidhbari.  Awards and honours  In 1993, The Week magazine selected Metre as the Woman of the Year. This was followed by Ojaswani Shikhar Sewa Alankaran Award of the Times Group in 2000, and the Women's Empowerment Award of the National Commission for Women in 2002. Two years later, Prophets of India, a 2004 publication, listed her as one of the protagonists and she received the Sadguru Ganananda Award for social service in 2005. She was awarded the Nina Sibal Award in 2006 by the All India Women's Education Fund Association (AIWEFA) for her leadership of CORD and the organization's contribution towards Integrated Community Based Rehabilitation work for differently abled person. The Government of India included her in the 2008 Republic Day honours list for the civilian award of the Padma Shri. The Guardian, the British national daily, chose her for the International Achievement Award in 2012, for her exceptional work to alleviate poverty in the developing world. In 2017, she was chosen for the Savitribai Jyotirao Phule award.

It ran through five English editions by 1684. At least two German editions were also printed. The book provides a recipe for trifle, involving cream but no custard, a gooseberry fool, hot chocolate, and cheesecakes. Woolley's mince pies still contain meat as well as dried fruits. Ingredients include pumpkins and molasses from the New World. The book contains the first known recipe for Sussex pond pudding.

The following recipes are a mixture, with cakes, creams and puddings, medicines, preserves and wines in no discernible order. No. 58, a trifle, is made with boiled cream, rosewater, mace, and some rennet to help it set. No. 109 is a gooseberry fool made with gooseberries, water, sugar, egg yolks, cream, and nutmeg. Recipe 101, \\"To make Collops of Bacon in Sweet-meats\\" calls for Marchpane Paste, sugar, cinnamon, and ginger, sliced into escalopes as if it were bacon. The foods described are the sweet-meats which Woolley considered that her \\"Gentlewomen\\" readers would \\"have the Charge of\\". Recipes involving meat appear with nos. 138 and 139, with \\"To make Christal Jelly\\" using knuckle of veal and calves feet, and \\"To make China-Broth\\" using \\"china\\", hartshorn, a \\"Red Cock cut in pieces and bruised\\", raisins and pearl barley.

The essayist Charles Lamb wrote that he found a copy of the Queen-Like Closet in a bookstall: \\"I lit upon a ragged duodecimo, which had been the strange delight of my infancy, and which I had lost sight of for more than forty years ... being an abstract of receipts in cookery, confectionery, cosmetics, needlework, morality, and all such branches of what were then considered as female accomplishments.\\" Kate Colquhoun notes that Woolley \\"addressed servants for the first time\\" in her books, focussing on practicality and economy. She argues that Woolley succeeded best by recognising that people \\"wanted to offer upmarket, modern dishes on a constrained budget.\\" She brought fashionable ingredients like anchovies, capers and wine into her simplified dishes, with frugal advice on reusing leftovers. Colquhoun however criticises her organisation: But, Colquhoun concludes, Woolley was \\"a fine, solid cook\\" who was prepared to roast woodcock \\"The French Way\\" however much she disliked the show of \\"some rare whimsical French cook\\", using bacon over the bird's breast and serving it on toast. And her bills of fare were \\"carefully detailed\\" with \\"a buttered apple pie, an almond custard or a syllabub ‚Äì the dessert of the age.\\" See also * A Collection of above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick and Surgery * The Good Huswifes Jewell Notes References External links * Text * Free ebook * Scan of the Queen-like closet (in 'manuscripts' archive) * Frontispiece and introduction at The British Library * Handwritten recipe for ye orange puding from front of a 1672 copy signed \\"Mary Halfpeny hor Booke 1678\\" Category:1670 books Category:English cuisine Category:Cookbooks ","title":"The Queen-Like Closet"},{"id":"49371868","text":"Abdullah Doshi (; born 28 October 1993) is a football (soccer) player who plays as a Midfielder for Hetten.

The Gupta family owns a business empire spanning computer equipment, media and mining, and has been the focus of widespread scrutiny because of its close ties to Jacob Zuma during his Presidency. In 2016 Atul Gupta became the seventh-wealthiest person in South Africa, with an estimated net worth of R10.7 billion (US$773.47 million), based on JSE-listed holdings. The family migrated from the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh to South Africa in 1993 to establish Sahara Computers. The family is based at the Sahara Estate in Saxonwold, Johannesburg, a compound comprising at least four mansions, and in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The family's strong ties to former South African president Jacob Zuma, both personally and through its company Oakbay Investments, have been the subject of extensive international scrutiny and caused much political controversy. The ties have led to widespread claims of corruption, undue influence and of state capture ‚Äì a term which is used to allege that the government undertakes activities and decisions, decides some high-level appointments, and determines control of some state enterprises, for the Gupta family's direct or indirect benefit, or in agreement with the family. In 2015 the Guptas' influence on the presidency was described by anti- corruption campaigner and former trades unionist Zwelinzima Vavi as being a \\"shadow government\\". Multiple MPs and ministers have stated that they were offered government positions by, or on behalf of, the Gupta family, in return for beneficial commercial decisions once appointed. In 2017 it was discovered that British PR company Bell Pottinger, acting on behalf of Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments, had deliberately manipulated and inflamed racial tensions, stirred up racial hatred, and made accusations of \\"white monopoly capital\\", using a large number of fake Twitter and other accounts online, as part of a campaign portraying Oakbay and those connected to it as victims, apparently intended to deflect corruption claims. Bell Pottinger subsequently collapsed in the wake of the scandal.  Interests  The family owns a number of companies in different industries ranging from energy to media publications. Their first venture into South Africa was the establishment of Sahara Computers and Sahara Systems (Pty) Ltd. In mining, their interests include Oakbay Resources and Energy: Uranium and gold mining and processing company, the Shiva Uranium Mine, Tegeta Exploration and Resources, Westdawn Investments (Pty) Ltd t/a JIC Mining Services and Black Edge Exploration. They have substantial media interests in South Africa through TNA Media (Pty) Ltd, including The New Age, a national newspaper, and ANN7 (African News Network), a 24-hour news channel. Other interests include VR Laser Services, steel fabrication for mining, engineering and armoured vehicle applications, Islandsite Investment 180. and Confident Concepts. On 8 September 2016 Oakbay Investments released their annual audited results. For the financial year ended 29 February 2016, the company's group revenue totaled R2.62 billion.  Relationship with Jacob Zuma  A protest placard depicting Atul Gupta carried by two EFF members on either side of it at a Zuma Must Fall protest in Cape Town. The slogan \\"#Not My President\\" on the placard explicitly links Atul Gupta with President Zuma. The Guptas and then vice-president Jacob Zuma first met at a function hosted by the Guptas at their Sahara Estate in 2003. Since then the family have been involved in a number of events involving Zuma and his family. The family is known to have been a supporter of Zuma during his power struggle for leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) with then president Thabo Mbeki in 2005. The family is known to have employed Zuma's wife Bongi Ngema-Zuma. One of Zuma's sons, Duduzane Zuma was a director in a number of Gupta owned firms and one of his daughters, Duduzile Zuma, was made a director of the Gupta owned Sahara computers in 2008. She has since resigned from that position. Duduzane Zuma has also since resigned from all positions held at Gupta owned businesses. Zuma's close relationship with the family is a source of tension within Zuma's own party the ANC. Likewise, Zuma denies granting undue influence to the family. The Guptas' influence on the presidency has been described by the former General Secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions Zwelinzima Vavi as a \\"shadow government.\\" Donwald Pressly of the South African business publication Biznews has stated that comments made by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa about the state capture of public enterprises by people with political connections was referring to the close relationship between Zuma and the Gupta family. One of South Africa's opposition parties, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), have stated that the Gupta's \\"have de facto colonised South Africa, with Zuma being the chief colonial administrator\\". The Guptas have denied this allegation, saying they have never taken any benefit from the relationship with Zuma. Zuma denies granting undue influence to the family. Prior to its national executive committee over the weekend of 18‚Äì20 March 2016, spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the ANC was concerned about state capture. In March 2016 the ANC launched an investigation into state capture and the Gupta family. In May ANC Secretary- General Gwede Mantashe said it would be a \\"fruitless\\" exercise for the party to continue to investigate allegations of state capture against the Gupta family as they had only received one written submission on the matter. A spokesman for the ‚ÄòHawks‚Äô - a serious crime investigative unit set up by the Zuma administration - stated that reports that corruption charges filed against the three ministers and the Gupta family are ‚Äòbaseless‚Äô. As part of the company's annual results announcement in September 2016, Oakbay Investments stated that government contracts accounted for 9% of the company's sales. Oakbay also stated that its largest mining company, JIC Mining Services, has never had a government contract, while Sahara, the second biggest contributor, has had no government contacts following a deliberate decision taken by the board in 2008. = Zupta = A reflection of the close relationship between the Gupta family and Jacob Zuma, particularly by both Zuma and the family's detractors, is the term \\"Zupta\\" to refer to this relationship. The portmanteau, a combination of \\"Z\\" from \\"Zuma\\" and the \\"upta\\" from \\"Gupta\\", was first coined by the Economic Freedom Fighters at the 2016 South African presidential state of the nation address when they disrupted the event by repeatedly chanting \\"Zupta must fall\\" to express their dissatisfaction with this relationship. = \\"Guptagate\\" wedding controversy = Waterkloof Air Force Base where the Jet Airways plane landed in April 2013, sparking the Guptagate controversy On 30 April 2013, an Airbus A330-200 chartered aircraft run by Jet Airways carrying 217 guests from India was cleared to land at the South African Air Force base at Waterkloof for the wedding ceremony of Vega Gupta to Aakash Jahajgarhia at Sun City, North West. This event caused a significant controversy that led to the African National Congress (ANC) and other political parties as well as the South African National Defence Union to denounce this use of the air force base. The ANC issued a statement calling for \\"those responsible for giving the family permission to come into the country without going through the normal channels be 'brought to book'\\". In the aftermath of the event, India's High Commissioner Virendra Gupta (not related to the Gupta family) said publicly that the Indian High Commission was given permission to land the plane at Waterkloof Air Force Base. He explained that the Commission communicated through its defence adviser with the chief of defence for foreign relations in the SA National Defence Force (SANDF). The landing was cleared by Bruce Koloane who was chief of state protocol at the department of international relations who insisted that the flight was a \\"sensitive\\" official visit. Koloane was demoted after an investigation concluded that he used Zuma's name to illegally authorise the landing. President Zuma was scheduled to attend the wedding but cancelled after the incident became public. The family apologised for the incident stating that they applied for special permission to land as a number of the guests were Indian government ministers and that it was promoting tourism to South Africa. The incident prompted a significant outcry, so much so that it was dubbed \\"Guptagate\\" by the South African media. In 2017, it was revealed that the wedding was paid for by funds, laundered through Dubai, and granted to a Gupta-linked company by the Free State Province government, purportedly as part of the Vrede Dairy Project.] In January 2018, the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the National Prosecuting Authority seized R220 million that Free State Department of Agriculture under Mosebenzi Zwane had paid to the Gupta family as part of this project, calling it a \\"scheme designed to defraud and steal monies from the department\\". The Hawks unit of South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) raided the offices of Ace Magashule, the Premier of the Free State, in connection with the project. =Influence over Cabinet appointments= In 2016, a series of allegations of the Guptas' influence over appointments to the South African Cabinet came to the fore. Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor claimed that in 2010 the Guptas had offered her the position of Minister of Public Enterprises, provided that she arranged for South African Airways to drop their India route, allowing Gupta-linked Jet Airways to take the route. She said she declined the offer, which occurred at the Guptas' Saxonwold residence, while President Zuma was in another room. This came a few days before a cabinet reshuffle in which minister Barbara Hogan was dismissed by Zuma. The Gupta family denied that the meeting took place and denied offering Vytijie a ministerial position. President Zuma claimed that he had no recollection of Vytjie Mentor. Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas confirmed media reports that he had been offered the ministerial position by the Guptas shortly before the disastrous dismissal of Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene in December 2015, but had rejected the offer out of hand as \\"it makes a mockery of our hard- earned democracy‚Äö the trust of our people and no one apart from the President of the Republic appoints ministers\\". The Gupta family denied offering Jonas the job of Finance Minister. The Sunday Times has reported that the Minister of Mineral Resources, Mosebenzi Zwane, and then Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, David van Rooyen (who was controversially appointed by President Zuma as Minister of Finance in December 2015) met with members of the Gupta family in Dubai. Van Rooyen allegedly met with them only a few days after his unsuccessful appointment to be Minister of Finance on 20 December 2015. Minister Zwane assisted in the sale of a large coal mine to a Gupta owned company. Former bodyguards of the Gupta family have stated that they often saw important government officials, such as Hlaudi Motsoeneng the COO of the state broadcaster the SABC, and large amounts of money in cash moving out of the Gupta's Saxonwold estate. The bodyguards also stated that Ajay Gupta would visit President Zuma up to three times a week until 2015 at the presidential guest house in Pretoria. A spokesperson for president Zuma denies that the visits ever happened. Ranjeni Munusamy of the Daily Maverick has stated the \\"Gupta family has effectively usurped the function of the ANC deployment committee\\" thereby undermining the party's ability to independently and legitimately select senior ministers and executives in government and state owned companies. Following a formal complaint submitted in March 2016 by a catholic priest, Father Stanslaus Muyebe, the Gupta's alleged influence became the subject of an investigation into \\"state capture\\" by outgoing Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. President Zuma and Minister Des van Rooyen applied for an interdict to prevent the publication of the report on 14 October 2016, Madonsela's last day in office. Van Rooyen's application was dismissed, and the President withdrew his application, leading to the release of the report on 2 November. The report recommends the establishment of a judicial commission of enquiry into the issues identified. The report recommends that a full probe of Mr. Zuma's dealings with the Guptas should be conducted by a commission of inquiry, with the findings published within 180 days. Zuma and Des van Rooyen have since denied any wrongdoing. The Gupta's lawyer disputed the evidence in the report. The Gupta family have denied any wrongdoing and welcomed the opportunity to challenge the report's findings in an official judiciary inquiry. On 25 November 2016, Zuma announced that the Presidency would be reviewing the contents of the state capture report. He said it \\"was done in a funny way\\" with \\"no fairness at all\\" and argued he was not given enough time to respond to the public protector. In late May 2017 a number of emails were leaked to the public from the Guptas and their associates implicating them in efforts to appoint government ministers and heads of government owned companies in addition to coordinating activities with political figures associated with President Zuma for their own personal gain. Most notable were efforts to appoint Gupta friendly executives for Transnet, Eskom, the appointment of Mosebenzi Zwane as minister of mineral resources. The ANC Youth League and the pro-Gupta political party Black First Land First (BLF) disputed the authenticity of the emails whilst the Communist Party of South Africa stated that the emails \\"look genuine\\". In January 2018, Ramaphosa announced that there would indeed be a Commission of Inquiry into State Capture,https://www.sastatecapture.org.za/site/about/mandate and this would be chaired by Deputy Chief Justice of South Africa Raymond Zondo. Hearings began on 20 August 2018,https://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/state-capture-commission- almost-running/ and are expected to last for two years. =Mining and energy interests= Oakbay Resources & Energy is a mining and processing company run by the Gupta family. It supplies minerals and mineral products, such as gold, uranium, platinum, coal and diamonds and also conducts trackless/mechanised mining, track bound mining, breast mining, down-dip mining and open-pit gold operation. Oakbay Resources & Energy began trading on the JSE on 28 November 2014. Iron ore dispute In 2010 the Gupta owned firm Imperial Crown Trading (ICT), along with Duduzane Zuma who was a part owner in ICT, were involved in a dispute with ArcelorMittal and Anglo American plc over the rightful ownership of Kumba Iron Ore, which owns Sishen mine, one of Africa's largest iron mines. The Department of Mineral Resources granted the ICT 21.4% ownership in the mine when ArcelorMittal did not renew their mining licence in time. The case was taken to the Constitutional Court where, in 2013, it was ruled that the Gupta/Zuma consortium could not claim rightful ownership. Had they won the case ArcelorMittal would have had to pay them R800 million (US$80 million). Coal The South African Sunday Times alleged that a Gupta owned company, Tegeta, benefited from official connections in the awarding of a R4 billion contract to supply coal to the state electrical utility company Eskom. The Mines Minister Mosebenzi Zwane denied this allegation saying that he didn't give Tegeta any preferential treatment and was only interested in preserving jobs following Tegeta's purchase of a coal mine that supplies Eskom. According to the business rescue practitioners Tegeta will also take on the R2.4 billion penalty imposed by Eskom on Optimum for delivering poor- quality coal. On 12 June, City Press alleged that Eskom awarded Tegeta a contract worth more than R564 million, paying in advance in order to ‚Äòbail out the Guptas‚Äô and that it also allowed the company to divert a significant portion of Optimum's coal to another power station in order to be bought at a higher price. An executive for Eskom said that paying companies in advance has been done before and that Eskom was not diverting coal from the Hendrina power plant to the Arnot power plant. Nazeem Howa described allegations as \\"sublime and ridiculous\\" and that prepayments were a standard practice of Eskom. On 8 September 2016, Nazeem Howa told Bloomberg that Oakbay Investments had signed a contract to export power-plant coal at a premium to the highest price it gets from Eskom of R150 ($11) per ton. He declined to comment on whether its export allocation was being sold. Uranium interests, Nhlanhla Nene, Pravin Gordhan and KPMG The family is alleged by the Rand Daily Mail to have worked closely with Zuma to secure interests in South Africa's nuclear energy sector. In 2014 the South African government announced that a 9 600 MW nuclear procurement programme that entailed the construction of six to eight nuclear reactors at an estimated cost of between R800 billion to R1.6 trillion (US$50-billion to US$100 billion) was under consideration. This proposal was approved by the Zuma cabinet on 9 December 2015. Zuma's controversial dismissal of then minister of finance Nhlanhla Nene on 9 December 2015 is alleged to have been partially motivated by Nene's department's resistance to the nuclear agreement. President Zuma stated that this move was motivated by Nene's nomination to head the African Regional Centre of the New Development Bank/Brics Bank. Zuma's statement was met with skepticism by the media and opposition political parties, partly because Nene was unaware of his nomination to the post. Nene was briefly replaced with the little known David van Rooyen before public criticism, and a sharp decline in the South African Rand and stock market led to Zuma re-appointing former minister of finance Pravin Gordhan to the position instead. Strong links between both of Van Rooyen's top two advisers and the Gupta family came to light a few months after Nene's dismissal. Shortly after Gordhan's appointment an investigation was initiated by the Hawks into allegations of corruption whilst he was head of the South African Revenue Service. The investigation was criticised on legal grounds and for being politically motivated by a number of organisations and individuals including the South African Communist Party. Gordhan stated that the Gupta family was behind the charges. The Gupta family denied being involved in any effort to remove Gordhan from office, however, in 2017, much of Gupta auditor KPMG‚Äôs senior leadership in South Africa resigned, and a report, issued by KPMG in 2015, accusing Gordhan of improprieties was withdrawn, after an internal investigation found that the work done by KPMG for Gupta family fell \\"considerably short\\" of the firm's standards, and amid a rising political and public backlash.  Power plants  The Gupta family was implicated in the alleged improper awarding of a contract to install a new boiler at the Duvha Power Station to Dongfang Electric after the Gupta connected advisory firm Trillian gave the Dongfang bid the go ahead. General Electric filed court papers stating that Dongfang was given the contract through a rigged tendering process by Eskom even though the Dongfang bid was R1 billion (US$76 million) more than the General Electric bid. = Railways = The Gupta family along with Duduzane Zuma have been implicated in an attempt to improperly influence the awarding of a R51 billion (roughly equivalent to US$6 billion in 2012) contract to deliver 600 trains to South Africa on behalf of the China South Rail company. In 2012 the former head of the South African Passenger Rail Agency (Prasa), Lucky Montana, wrote a letter detailing an attempt by the Guptas and Zuma to pressure then South African minister of transport, Ben Martins, and Montana, Prasa's then CEO, to favour China South Rail. The letter became public in June 2016 when Montana sent a copy to the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism.  SAP kickback allegations In July 2017, SAP was accused of having paid CAD House, a Gupta-controlled company, R100 million in order to secure a Transnet deal in 2015. SAP denied the allegations, claiming that the money was paid as \\"an extension of the sales force\\", despite CAD House having no prior SAP experience. As a consequence of the allegations, SAP suspended some managers, and launched an investigation appointing an acting managing director for Africa while the investigation continued. = Armaments = VR Laser Services, in which the Guptas and Duduzane Zuma, President Zuma's son, own a 25% stake, entered into a partnership with the state owned aerospace and defence company Denel to establish Denel Asia, based in Hong Kong. The official opposition, Democratic Alliance have alleged that the establishment of the joint venture is illegal as certain provisions of the Public Finance Management Act have not been complied with. The Minister of Public Enterprises, Lynne Brown, confirmed that the Asian marketing arm of Denel was not in compliance with various legal provisions. =Media= The international news broadcaster Al Jazeera English has alleged that Zuma's close relationship with the Guptas has \\"translated into friendly coverage in the outlets they own,\\" specifically ANN7 and the New Age.  Economic Freedom Fighters criticism  On 4 February 2016 Julius Malema of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) announced that members of the press from Gupta owned media companies, ANN7 and The New Age, would no longer be welcome at future EFF media announcements. The EFF alleged that this was because of their role as being part of a \\"propaganda machinery\\" of a \\"corrupt cartel\\". He stated that the EFF \\"cannot guarantee the safety of those who are working in those studios and printing factories of the New Age and ANN7.\\" The EFF criticised the \\"New Age Breakfasts\\", a series of breakfast events organised by The New Age with and often paid for by government departments, as well as accused the paper of receiving preferential treatment in receiving advertising contracts from government. A spokesperson for the African National Congress defended the Gupta family, stressing their history of investment in South Africa. A few days later the EFF released a list of 25 reasons why they are against the family, again accusing them of receiving preferential treatment in business dealings with government as well as government preference and collusion with Gupta owned media interests. The EFF's perceived threats towards ANN7 and New Age employees caused a number of other media commentators and publications to criticise Malema's remarks as threatening media independence and advocating violence towards the media and a particularly strong rebuke from the New Age and ANN7. An anti-gag order disallowing the EFF from banning The New Age and ANN7 from EFF media briefings was issued by the High Court following Malema's remarks. The court also upheld the applicants‚Äô rights and those of the Gupta family as South African citizens to remain in South Africa and carry out business operations. The judge presiding over the case concluded that Malema's statement was a \\"threat of violence\\" and said the Guptas and their employees \\"have a constitutionally protected right not to be threatened with violence\\".  Sekunjalo Investments dispute  In November 2012, the Gupta family, through Oakbay, were granted an option to buy 50% of the shares of Independent News and Media South Africa, one of the largest newspaper operations in South Africa, after the company had been bought out by Sekunjalo Investments who was negotiating the purchase of the group from the Irish owned Independent News and Media. After the successful purchase of the group by Sekunjalo in February 2013 Oakbay sought to exercise its share purchase options. This led to disagreements between Oakbay and Sekunjalo about the true value and cost of the options and so they could not settle on an agreement as to how much Oakbay should pay for the shares. Ten percent of buyout by Sekunjalo was also funded by the South African Government Employees Pension Fund who had never agreed to Oakbay having the options and, when asked in early 2016, rejected Oakbay's request to exercise the option to buy 50% of the now Sekunjalo owned newspaper publishing company. This led to Oakbay taking Sekunjalo to court. Public relations efforts and the Bell Pottinger controversy To deal with mounting public criticism the Gupta family hired the public relations firm Bell Pottinger. In late February 2016 several internet-based sources were altered to be favourable to the Guptas. These included activities in Wikipedia, chat rooms, blogs and on news articles related to the Gupta family. It is thought by the Mail and Guardian that these favourable alterations were part of a sustained media campaign to improve the family's image. After emails from servers associated with Gupta newspapers were leaked, Bell Pottinger was reported to be involved in substantial editing of this Wikipedia page about the Guptas; a Bell Pottinger employee was said to have emailed much of the content to a Gupta account for it to be uploaded. In a statement to the Financial Times on 25 November 2016, Bell Pottinger stated that their role has been \\"to correct misperceptions\\" about Oakbay. They have intended to communicate that a competitive, disruptive, job-creating narrative is what is needed to achieve transformation in South Africa. Gupta owned media outlets, ANN7 and The New Age, ran stories alleging an anti-Zuma plot by a faction within the ANC was one possible source of allegations against the Gupta family. Following the ANC's national executive council meeting in March 2016 the ANC's secretary general issued a statement criticising the coverage of the event by Gupta family owned media. In response ANN7 and The New Age agreed to publish an official apology to the ANC. Bell Pottinger announced they had dropped the Gupta family as clients on 12 April 2017 . This followed a Sunday Times article that claimed that the Gupta family and President Zuma worked with the firm to incite racial tensions using bots and sockpuppets on social media in an effort to manipulate public opinion. Leaked emails allegedly from the Guptas suggested that the family planned to deal with negative publicity by buying newspapers critical of the family such as Mail & Guardian. Bell Pottinger went into administration (bankruptcy) in September 2017, as a consequence of the scandal resulting from activities undertaken by the firm on behalf of the Guptas, particularly its role in inflaming racial tension in South Africa. = Fake news = Media interests owned by Gupta were blamed by other South African media organisations and civil society organisations for running fake news campaigns against a number of individuals and groups judged hostile to Gupta interests. Targets included The Huffington Post, Sunday Times, Radio 702, and City Press in addition to individuals such as Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan who was seen as blocking Gupta attempts at state capture. Attacks against Gordhan focused on accusations of him promoting state capture for \\"white monopoly capital\\". = Corporate response = Due to the controversial nature of the family's relationship with Jacob Zuma numerous South African and international banking and auditing firms decided to end their business dealings with Gupta-owned firms in early April 2016. The auditing firm KPMG, the brokerage Sasfin Bank, and Barclays Africa's Absa bank as well as First National Bank all announced that they would no longer be dealing with the Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments, the holding company for the family's investments. Johan van Dyk at the South African financial forensics firm Censeo stated that companies were disassociating with the family due to concerns that an association with the family could cost them customers. In response the Gupta-owned Oakbay alleged that this is \\"clear proof that the recent allegations against the company and the wider Gupta family are all part of a carefully orchestrated political campaign\\". Oakbay executives publicly repeated the accusation and went on to accuse South African businessman Johan Rupert of being involved in a conspiracy against them. Oakbay stated that Rupert, through the Rupert-owned Remgro investment company, had interests in the country's financial institutions and that this allowed him to influence banks so that they would stop doing business with Oakbay. Although Remgro had a 3.3% share ownership in FirstRand it did not have any investments or ownership in any of the other financial institutions Oakbay accused it of having. On 8 April 2016, Duduzane Zuma, Atul Gupta, and Varun Gupta announced that they would be stepping down from their director positions at Oakbay Resources and Energy in response to mounting pressure. Oakbay stated that it had become nearly impossible to conduct business due to the business community's decision to discontinue doing business with the controversial firm. A few days later, Ajay and Atul Gupta along with other members of the family were reported to have left South Africa for Dubai. Julius Malema of the EFF, claimed that president Zuma illegally took out R6 billion (US$400 million) of the Gupta's money for them from South Africa when he visited the United Arab Emirates in March 2016. The trade union and ANC political ally COSATU criticised the move by South African financial institutions to refuse to do business with Oakbay on the grounds that it was \\"political posturing\\" and put the jobs of thousands of South African employees of the firm at risk. On 20 June it was reported that the Gupta family were back in South Africa after an extended time away from the country. On 8 September 2016, after announcing their annual results, Nazeem Howa told Reuters that the company was intending to urge the four banks that ended their relationships with the company to reopen their accounts. Howa was also quoted as stating that a judicial commission of enquiry into the banks would be the \\"best way\\" to shed light on the reasoning behind their decision to close the accounts with Oakbay. = Public response = Notable ANC members Ahmed Kathrada and Derek Hanekom called on the ANC to address public concerns relating to Zuma's relationship with the Gupta family. Prior to criticising financial institutions for refusing to do business with Oakbay the trade union COSATU called for president Zuma to distance himself from the Gupta family. Following Kathrada's death in March 2017, Zuma was not invited to his funeral at Kathradas family's request due to Zuma's controversial relationship with the Gupta family, and former president Kgalema Motlanthe read an open letter that Kathrada had published a year before his death calling on Zuma to resign. A hacktivist group claiming to be associated with the African chapter of Anonymous launched a number of Distributed Denial of Service attacks on websites associated with the Gupta family in mid-June 2016. Gupta owned companies targeted included the websites of Oakbay Investments, Oakbay Resources and Energy, The New Age, IT firm Sahara, and ANN7. The South African artist Ayanda Mabulu exhibited a controversial painting criticizing president Zuma's controversial and close relationship with the Guptas. The painting portrayed president Zuma performing an act of anilingus on Atul Gupta in the cockpit of an airplane against a backdrop of the ANC flag. President Zuma's relationship with the family became a campaign issue that negatively affected the ANC's performance in the 2016 South African municipal elections. Following the dismissal of Gordan as Minister of Finance in April 2017 anti-Zuma protests were held across South Africa including in front of the Gupta family estate in Johannesburg.  Financial transactions  In October 2016, the South African Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan stated in court documents that the Guptas were implicated in \\"suspicious transactions worth R6.8 billion\\". The court documents were filed as part of a high court application explaining why the Minister of Finance could not intervene on the Gupta's behalf to require that South African banks continue to provide services to Gupta-owned companies. The documents stated that South African banks were alarmed by the financial dealings of 14 Gupta-owned businesses and discontinued services to the family to avoid possible legal implications. The Gupta's lawyers publicly disputed Gordhan's statement and stated that a number of errors were made including that a number of the disputed transactions regarding one of the financial dealings, the Optimum mine, occurred when the mine was not yet under the control of the family. On 18 August 2017, the North Gauteng High Court dismissed Gordhan's court application seeking declaratory relief from having to intervene with the banks' decisions to close the bank accounts of the Oakbay investments. An investigation by the South African- based amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism alleges that the Guptas benefited from a number of state contracts using their political connections through a sophisticated system of financial dealings totalling up to R144 million (US$10.6 million) in only one six-month period. A report compiled by the South African Council of Churches and South African academics stated that R40 billion (equivalent to US$3 billion) was illegally smuggled out of South Africa to Dubai by the Gupta family and their associated companies between 2011/12 and 2017. The money having allegedly originated from South African parastatials such as South African Airways, Eskom and Transnet. The Gupta family has filed an interdict against its last remaining bank in South Africa, the Bank of Baroda, to prevent it from closing their accounts at the bank. The Bank of Baroda did this after flagging 36 suspicious transactions on Gupta linked accounts over a ten-month period valued at R4.2bn and amid accusations of the bank helping the family launder money. On 4 September 2017 the Bank of Baroda was fined R11 million (equivalent to US$837,000) by the South Africa Financial Intelligence Centre for flouting anti-corruption laws in transactions on accounts owned by the Gupta family. By September 2017 two international and four South African banks had closed Gupta linked accounts they had held due to suspicious transactions.  Sales of business units in August 2017  On 21 August 2017, Oakbay announced the sale of both of its media units; ANN7 (Infinity Media) and The New Age (TNA Media) to a firm named Lodidox, owned by Mzwanele Manyi. Per the company's statement, Oakbay would sell its shareholding in Infinity Media (ANN7 TV news) for R300-million and its two-thirds stake in TNA Media (The New Age) for R150-million. The sale was vendor financed which entailed the lending of R450 million in shares to the Manyi owned Lodidox by the Gupta owned Oakbay so that the business sale could take place. The EFF criticised the deal by stating that it was a form of fronting to disguise continued Gupta ownership. On 23 August 2017, Oakbay announced the sale of Tegeta Exploration and Resources business to Swiss-based Charles King SA for R2.97-billion. Oakbay stipulated that the purchaser safeguards the employment in the mines along with having a minimum of 30% of the shares allocated to a Black Empowerment Partner.  American investigations  In October 2017, it was reported that the FBI had opened an investigation into Gupta nephews Ashish and Amol, who are US Citizens, resident in Texas, as a result of payments received from a Gupta-linked company in the United Arab Emirates. On 16 February 2018, two days after Zuma had stepped down as president of South Africa, Ajay Gupta was declared a fugitive from justice by South African authorities after failing to turn himself over to the authorities. This was later withdrawn by the National Prosecuting Authority after all charges against Ajay Gupta were dropped.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ajay-gupta-no-longer-a- fugitive-after-warrant-cancelled-20190214 The US Treasury imposed sanctions on the Gupta family and an associate for engaging in \\"widespread corruption and bribery\\" in October 2019.

In 1886/87 he conducted archaeological research in Greece, and in 1888 he visited Italy. In 1890 he relocated to the University of Innsbruck as an associate professor of classical archaeology (full professor, 1894). In 1898 he succeeded Otto Benndorf as professor of archaeology at the University of Vienna, where later, he was appointed dean (1910/11) and rector (1916/17).Reisch, Emil In: Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB).

The Stadium of Delphi lies on the highest spot of the Archaeological Site of Delphi. It overlooks the sanctuary of Apollo and has a view to the Delphic Landscape. It was built either within the second half of the 4th century B.C. or even after the Galatian attacks. Its measured 178 meters in length and knew several refurbishment phases. The Stadium of Delphi is the best preserved ancient stadium in Greece.http://www.pausanias-footsteps.nl/english/delphi-eng.html Description The stadium occupied the highest part of the site, built over and to the northwest of the sanctuary of Apollo. It is epigraphically attested as ‚Äúthe pythikon stadion\\". To the north it was supported by the slope of the mountain, whereas to the south a wall was built to support the seats for the spectators. It is unknown when the site actually started being used for the Pythian Games. However, archaeological study proves that the actual architectural formation took place either within the second half of the 4th century or towards the mid-3rd century B.C., after the victory against the Galatians and possibly at the instigation of the Aetolian League.Earlier studies concluded that the stadium was first built in the 5th century. See Dinsmooor,W.B.,(1950) The Architecture of Ancient Greece,New York,pp.250-251 Within the stadium took place the ‚Äúgymnastic‚Äù contests, i.e. the track and field sports. Musical contests were probably organized there as well. A 2nd century B.C. inscription informs us on Satyr the Samian who performed a hymn ‚Äúfor the god and the Greeks‚Äù to the sound of the guitar. Another interesting inscription, embedded on the eastern side of the support wall, is that forbidding to take out the wine destined for sacred rituals. The inscription has attracted the interest of epigraphists, but it has been proposed that maybe this was not its original place and that it is actually in second use. The construction of the stadium can be discerned in at least four different phases. The initial construction dates, as mentioned above, to the 4th or mid-3rd century B.C. The latter dating coincides with the celebration of the Soteria, ceremonial celebration of the victory against the Galatians. Up to 20 athletes could compete simultaneously on the tracks, but soon the tracks were reduced to 17. The aphesis (starting points) were made of stone. The tiers on the south side were added only in 100 BC. A final restoration phase took place in the Roman period, consisting of the revetment of the tiers with stone. The total capacity was about 6,500 spectators. The starting point is preserved on the east accompanied with two rows of incised slabs for placing the feet of the runners. Four pillars on the eastern side must have supported a monumental arch.

Construction and testimonies The stele of Prusias is located to the northeast of the entrance of the temple of Apollo in the archaeological site of Delphi. It has been restored in situ. The monument has been identified through an inscription mentioning that it was dedicated by the Aetolian League to honour king Prusias II of Bithynia, in northwestern Asia Minor: ¬´¬ª.(To the king Prusias, son of king Prusias, the Aetolian League for his virtue and the benefactions he bestowed upon them).Colin G.

FD III, Epigraphie, Paris Due to this inscription it was also possible to date the ex voto after 182 B.C., when Prusias II succeeded his father, Prusias I, on the throne of Bithynia. Description The monument consists of a tall base made of rows of rectangular blocks, whereas on its upper part it bears a decoration in relief depicting garlands and bucraniums; the decoration included also a low molding with supports (geisipodes). Its total height reached 9.70 meters. At the top stood the statue of king Prusias on horseback. On the upper part of the monument rows of rectangular slits are possibly related to the entire composition, as they might have been used to fasten floral motifs, such as crops, which probably alluded to the benefaction of the king. They could also have contained bronze blades aiming at protecting the monument against the birds.Perrie, A. (2008). ¬´La moisson et les pigeons.

Retrieved February 29, 2016\\"Titular Episcopal See of Sagone\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016 History Cathedral of S. Appianu, Sagone The islands of Corsica, Sardina, and the Balearics suffered severely in the depradations of the Vandals in the second half of the fifth century. Appianu, the eponymous saint of the Cathedral of Sagone, is said to have died in exile. Archaeology indicates that only the inland town of Castellu in Upper Corse survived.Neither Ughelli (p. 515), nor Cappelletti (p. 394-395) nor even Gams (p. 767) names Appianu as a bishop of Sagone, let alone its first bishop. There were no Corsican representatives at the Council of Carthage in 484. Belisarius appears to have done nothing for Corsica, and the Lombard invasions had a negative impact. It is only in the time of Pope Gregory I (590-604) that information becomes available. Having heard of the terrible state of Christianity on the island of Corsica, Gregory sent a bishop, a certain Leo, to the island, with the license to ordain priests and deacons in a diocese not his own, the diocese of Sagone.Gregory I, Epistolarum Liber I, no. 78 (sometimes numbered 76), in\\" J. P. Migne (ed.), Patrologiae Latinae Tomus LXXVII (Paris 1862), pp. 532-533. Cappelletti remarks that the reference to Sagona in the manuscripts is far from secure; various manuscripts give Saonensem, Sagonensem, Salonensem, Harnensem, and Aleriensem. Pope Gregory's letter no. 80 (also referred to as letter 79), however, addresses the clergy and nobles of Corsica, informing them that he is sending Bishop Martinus to replace Bishop Leo as Visitor and requesting that they assist him. It is reasonable, as Cappelletti points out, that Saonensem is not Savona on the mainland, but a diocese on Corsica. Gregory remarks that the diocese had been without a bishop for many years: ... Ecclesiam Saonensem ante annos plurimos, obejunte eius pontifice, omnino destitutam agnovimus. It is around this time that the oldest foundations of the church on whose ruins the cathedral which came to be dedicated to St. Appianu was begun in the twelfth century.Daniel Istria, \\"√âtude architecturale de la cathedrale m√©di√©vale Sant'Appianu de Sagone (Vico, Corse-du-Sud),\\" There are no textual references to a cathedral until the 12th century. Whether the sixth century ruins were a cathedral and whether the building was dedicated to St. Appianu from the foundation cannot be determined. It is said that the Diocese of Sagone (Dioecesis Sagonensis) was established in AD 500. Ughelli states that Pope Paschal I (817-824), after the devastation of the island by the Saracens (Arabs), erected five bishoprics on the island, Sagone among them.Ughelli, p. 515. In 1123, at a Lateran Council, Pope Calixtus II consecrated a bishop for the Church of Sagona, but unfortunately his name is not preserved.Cappelletti, p. 395. Gams, p. 767. Cf. J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio editio novissima, Tomus vigesimus primus (21) (Venice: Antonio Zatta 1776), pp. 269-271. This anonymous bishop is the first person to whom one can point as a Bishop of Sagona. The Pope also decided definitively, with the council fathers agreeing, that the pope himself would consecrate all bishops on the island of Corsica, rather than favor the Genoese or the Pisitans. In 1179 a bishop of Sagone, whose name is unfortunately not preserved, was present at the Lateran Council of Pope Alexander III and subscribed its decrees.Ughelli, p. 516. J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio editio novissima, Tomus vigesimus secundus (22) (Venice: Antonio Zatta 1778), p. 462: Saganensis episcopus de Corsica. In 1284 the island of Corsica was conquered by Genoa, but, although the political life of the island was directed by the Genoese, the dioceses on the island continued to be suffragans of the Archdiocese of Pisa. As might be expected, however, the bishops who were elected tended to be Genoese or from places in the territory of the Republic of Genoa. Pope Paul IV (1555‚Äì1559) authorized the Cathedral of Sagone to adopt the Virgin Mary of the Assumption as its patron saint. He permitted the Cathedral Chapter to have two dignities, the Archdeacon and the Archpriest, and five residentiary canons; there were two other canons who, because of the limited income of the Chapter, were not required to reside.Ughelli, pp. 515-516. Cappelletti, p. 394. In 1751 the town of Sagone was in ruins and uninhabited. The bishop lived in Vico, a small town of some 800 inhabitants, under the civil government of Genoa. The corporation of the Cathedral Chapter still existed, with two dignities and six canons. In Vico there was one monastery of men.Ritzler, VI, p. 362, note 1. The island of Corsica was conquered by the French in 1769,Robiquet, pp. 323-332. and its inhabitants were naturalized as French citizens by King Louis XV. Under the terms of the Concordat of Bologna in 1516, the bishops of the island came to be nominated by the King of France. During the French Revolution, the National Constituent Assembly reformed the Church in France, drawing up the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (12 July 1790).Text of Civil Constitution of the Clergy (in English) Retrieved: 2016-11-13. All clergy were obliged to swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution, thereby effectively entering into a schism with the Papacy and the Roman Catholic Church, and the number of bishoprics in France was dramatically reduced. The five bishoprics on the island of Corsica were suppressed and combined into one, to be called the dioc√®se de Corse. When the electors of Corsica assembled, they elected Ignace-Fran√ßois Guasco, Provost (or Dean) of the Cathedral Chapter of Mariana.Ignace-Fran√ßois Guasco is not to be confused with Bishop Mathieu Guasco, Bishop of Sagone from 1793 to 1801. Gams, p. 767. He was consecrated at Aix on 16 June 1791 by Constitutional Bishop Charles-Beno√Æt Roux, Metropolitan of Bouches-de-Rh√¥ne; the consecration was valid but illicit and schismatic. The people of Ajaccio were having none of their new Constitutional Bishop; on 2 June they tore down his arms from the cathedral and restored those of the legitimate bishop. On 11 August 1793, judging that the territory of Corse was too large, the National Convention in the Constitution of 1793 divided both the department and the diocese of Corse into two, Golo (Guasco, resident at Ajaccio) and Liamone, and ordered a second bishop to be elected for the northern and eastern part of the island. Before this could be done, however, the British seized the island, and on 23 December 1793, Guasco recanted and resigned. On 29 November 1801, following the agreement on the Concordat of 1801 between First Consul Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII, the diocese of Sagona was suppressed by the Pope, and its territory and Catholic population assigned to the Archdiocese of Ajaccio. In April 2002 the diocese of Sagone was restored as Titular Episcopal See of Sagone, though, of course, without the administrative apparatus. Both holders of the title (as of November 2016), were appointed to the title to qualify them as papal nuncios. Both also had the title \\"Archbishop\\" for the same reason.

Description The Portico of the Aetolians is a large portico situated to the west of the sacred precinct of Apollo in Delphi. It measures in length and in width. It was provided with a double colonnade: the exterior one comprised 29 columns and the interior one 15. It was probably constructed initially in the 4th century B.C. However, it has been associated with the Aetolian League and its increased power and influence over Delphi in the 3rd century B.C. The reason for this might be that it sheltered arms dedicated by the Aetolians as part of their booty after their victory over the Galatians.Jacquemin, A., 1985, Aitolia et Aristaineta. Offrandes monumentales √©toliennes √† Delphes au iiie s. av. J.-C., Kt√®ma, 10, pp. 27‚Äì35 Several interpretations of the monument have seen the light. A detailed study of the remains offered a fascinating glimpse over the way in which the arms and armours were fastened to the monument in order to be displayed. Some scholars think that it might have been used as an arsenal from the beginning, whereas others conclude that it acquired this use only after the Galatian invasions.Perrier, A., 2011, ¬´ Le portique dit ‚Äòdes Etoliens‚Äô √† Delphes: Bilan et perspectives‚Äù, Pallas 87,pp.39‚Äì56 There is a general consensus that the building was associated with the deliberate effort of the Aetolian League to be commemorated within the sanctuary through a series of ex-votos and minor monuments established in the site at their instigation.Jacquemin, A., 1985, Aitolia et Aristaineta.

Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, [in:] Real Academia de Ciencias Economicas y Financieras website, available here Academic Salamanca In 1874 Gil apparently intended to take part in contest for chairs of elementos de derecho publico y administrativo espa√±ol, to be held by universities in Oviedo, Valencia and Granada. Though admitted, for reasons which are not clear he did not attend the hearings.Mart√≠n 2014 In July 1875 he did, however, participate in the contest for chairing c√°tedra de derecho pol√≠tico y administrativo in his native University of Salamanca, and emerged successful,Mart√≠n 2014; some sources claim in 1873, see Rojas 2001, p. 214 in 1876 nominated catedr√°tico numerario.Mart√≠n 2014 He will occupy this post for the next 32 years, failing to show up at university premises only 4 days before death.Revista cat√≥lica de cuestiones sociales 163 (1908) p. 470 The only difference in his assignment was that at some point the c√°tedra was split in two, and Gil continued as chair of derecho pol√≠tico.Mart√≠n 2014 A number of times Gil attempted to move away from Salamanca. In 1881 he was unsuccessful when applying for the same chair in Barcelona. The appeal was turned down by the ministry, but his victorious contender resigned and Gil was appointed in due course. However, shortly afterwards Gil resigned as well, quoting \\"unforeseen circumstances\\", and resumed his Salamanca duties.as the contest took place during the summer holiday period, Gil‚Äôs career in Salamanca has not been interrupted, Mart√≠n 2014 In 1882-1883 he fielded his candidature for derecho publico at Universidad Central in Madrid; the attempt was unsuccessful following some repeated changes of the admission procedure, which might be interpreted as aimed against Gil.Mart√≠n 2014 In 1883-1886 he applied to enter the contest for c√°tedra de historia del derecho at Central, but was not admitted on legal grounds; similarly, he was rejected in 1885 for literatura jur√≠dica and in 1886 for derecho can√≥nico, always at Central. In 1891 he resumed his attempt for historia in Madrid, again to no avail. In 1901 Gil presented his bid for chair of Estudios Superiores de Derecho penal y de Antropolog√≠a criminal, again in the capital, and was again unsuccessful.it was a newly created chair within the faculty of law, Mart√≠n 2014 university chapel Gil was building his academic position over time. In the early 1880s he had to suffer aggression from liberal circles both in the city and at the Salamanca university;Jos√© Mar√≠a Hern√°ndez D√≠az, Maestros y escuelas en la Salamanca contempor√°nea, Salamanca 2001, ISBN SBN 8495327031, esp. the sub-chapter Agresi√≥n a Gil Robles por un \\"cate\\" en la Universidad (1884) as late as in the mid-1880s he was referred to as \\"almost unknown\\" in the world of Spanish law scholars.\\"casi desconocido\\", Adolfo Posada, Fragmentos de mis memorias, Oviedo 1983, , p. 268 Gradually gaining recognition, throughout his career Gil was a number of times acting as judge in numerous contests for academic chairs across Spain and took part in national juridical congresses.e.g. in 1881 in Granada, 1886 and 1888 in Barcelona or 1902 in Seville, Mart√≠n 2014, also El Dia 25.08.86, available here or El Dia 18.08.88, available here He was also popular among students, who appreciated his clear style combined with courtesy and benevolence.his peculiarity was the obsession to know each student personally; for picturesque description of his lectures see Rojas 2001, pp. 216-217 Temporarily rising to dean of the law faculty,at unspecified time and as decano interino, temporary dean, Rojas 2001, p. 218 in the early 1890s Gil, along Mariano Ar√©s Sanz, was already among the most prestigious Salamanca scholars;Posada 1983, p. 270 indeed by the end of the decade together with other neo-Thomists he dominated the Salamanca intellectual realm and was largely responsible for conservative reputation of the university.Luis Enrique Rodr√≠guez-San Pedro Bezares, Historia de la Universidad de Salamanca, vol. 1, Trayectoria hist√≥rica e instituciones vinculadas, Salamanca 2002, , p. 254 At the turn of the centuries it was rather the newcomers with pro-socialist leaning, like Miguel de Unamuno, who had to struggle against overwhelmingly conservative ambience.Unamuno wrote: \\"esta Salamanca era por entonces, cuando yo llegu√© ac√°, uno de los m√°s activos focos ‚Äì acaso el m√°s activo ‚Äì de las luchas intestinas de la derecha antiliberal\\", quoted after Ana Chaguaceda Toledano, Miguel de Unamuno. Estudios sobre su obra, Vol. 2, Salamanca 2005, , p. 74 Largely aided by arrival of Pedro Dorado Montero, they gained ground in the 1900s,Posada 1983, p. 270 though Gil Robles until his death remained an iconic Salamanca figure.Jean-Claude Rabat√©, 1900 en Salamanca. Guerra y paz en la Salamanca del joven Unamuno, Salamanca 1997, , p. 15 Works Tratado de derecho Enrique Gil Robles was not a prolific writer; his written heritage is one major work, few booklets, a couple of articles in specialized reviews and a handful of manuscripts. He is known to have contributed to a number of periodicals, but exact scope of this activity is unclear; none of the scholarly studies consulted refers to him as \\"periodista\\".Gil is known to have contributed to La Informacion - see La Epoca 27.07.08, available here, to La Regi√≥n - see Jos√© Andres Gallego, La politica religiosa en Espa√±a, Madrid 1975, p. 41, to La Tradicion - see Rabat√© 1997, p. 170, and to La Tesis, Carlos Manuel S√°nchez P√©rez, Manuel S√°nchez Asensio (1860-1919) a trav√©s de los peri√≥dicos que fund√≥ y dirigi√≥, [in:] Documentaci√≥n de las Ciencias de la Informaci√≥n 30 (2007), p. 152 His works fall into 3 categories: theory of state, theory of law and pedagogy. Though he started writing in the early 1870s, his best known works were written and published between 1891 and 1902. Gil's opus magnum was Tratado de derecho pol√≠tico seg√∫n los principios de la filosof√≠a y el derecho cristianos (Treaty on political law according to the principles of Christian law and philosophy), published in Salamanca in two volumes respectively in 1899 and 1902. Spanning across over 1,100 pages, the work was intended to provide exhaustive lecture on organization of state in general and principles of public law in particular, though it grew into synthesis of author's view on politics, history and religion. Two other publications, incomparable in size but far more often quoted, are two booklets: El absolutismo y la democracia (1891, containing his address opening the academic year in University of Salamanca) and Oligarqu√≠a y caciquismo. Naturaleza. Primeras causas. Remedios. Urgencia de ellos (1901). Both were formatted as lectures on problems of current Spanish politics, enveloped in wider ideological and philosophical discourse. Much less known is his early work on theory of a lawful state, ¬øQu√© condiciones debe reunir la Jurisprudencia para disfrutar de la autoridad de doctrina legal? (1888). El catolicismo liberal Among a number of works related to education the first to be named is El catolicismo liberal y la libertad de ense√±anza (1896), a book comparing Catholic and liberal educational models; it developed theses laid out earlier in La Libertad Universitaria (1882).see La Ciencia Cristiana 37 (1884), available here Less partisan and more technical studies were Ensayo de metodologia juridical (1893), Gu√≠a para el estudio del Derecho administrativo (1899), Advertencia preliminar a las \\"Recitaciones de Derecho Can√≥nico y disciplina Eclesi√°stica de Espa√±a\\" de Juli√°n Portilla Mart√≠n (1900), Indicador y programa para la explicaci√≥n en c√°tedra y la preparaci√≥n fuera de ella de la asignatura de derecho pol√≠tico espa√±ol comparado con el extranjero (1906), M√©todo de ense√±anza y programa de la asignatura de Elementos de Derecho pol√≠tico y administrativo espa√±ol, Memoria acerca del m√©todo de ense√±anza, plan, y programa de la asignatura de elementos de Derecho Pol√≠tico y Administrativo espa√±ol and Razonamiento y programa de la asignatura de Historia general del Derecho espa√±ol para las oposiciones de dicha C√°tedra vacante en la Universidad Central (all in manuscript).Gonzalo D√≠az D√≠az, Hombres y documentos de la filosof√≠a espa√±ola, vol. 3, Madrid 1988, , p. 462 Gil's written heritage is complete with very few scholarly articles on politics, education and law,Sobre el discurso de D.

Seremos inflexibles e intransigentes con las miserias y los vicios\\", the latter a reference to liberalism, S√°nchez P√©rez 2007, p. 152 then La Regi√≥n and finally La Informaci√≥n.La Regi√≥n was issued in Salamanca between 1890 and 1892, La Informaci√≥n between 1892 and 1897, S√°nchez P√©rez 2007, p. 159 However, Gil left his trademark on the Salmantine life by means of two long-lasting conflicts with other local personalities. The intransigent Integrists clashed with the Spanish ecclesiastical hierarchy, which advocated the platform of Catholic unity, almost from the onset, which finally led to calling off the 1882 pilgrimage to Rome.El Siglo Futuro 20.02.82, available here Locally the conflict was aggravated with the 1885 arrival of the new Salamanca bishop, Tom√°s C√°mara y Castro, a hierarch described as posibilista,S√°nchez P√©rez 2007, p 153; he declared acceptance of art. 11 of the 1876 constitution, which set a new model of church-state relations, and adhered to the \\"hypothesis\\" theory, logical pillar of the \\"Catholic unity\\" strategy, Posada 1983, pp. 268-9 moderado and aperturista.Mariano Esteban de Vega, Cat√≥licos contra liberales notas sobre el ambiente ideol√≥gico salmantino en la Restauraci√≥n, [in:] Studia historica. Historia contempor√°nea 4 (1986), p. 51 He launched onslaught on fundamentalist line of local Traditionalist periodicals,Posada 1983, p. 269 which soon led to an open press war;de Vega 1986, p. 51 the most distinguished representative of Salmantine Integros, supported by the local Jesuits,\\"jesuitas de la Clerec√≠a\\", Claude Rabat√© 1997, pp. 169-170 was Gil, dubbed \\"prohombre\\" of \\"camarilla jesu√≠tica antiepiscopal\\".S√°nchez P√©rez 2007, p. 166 The conflict climaxed in 1892, when C√°mara banned local Catholics from reading La Regi√≥nLa Uni√≥n Cat√≥lica 05.04.92, available here; the episcopal order read: \\"esta prohibici√≥n se extiende, mientras otra cosa no orden√°ramos, √° cualquier papel peri√≥dico que redactaren D. Manuel S√°nchez Asensio √≥ D. Enrique Gil y Robles\\" and all periodicals edited by Manuel S√°nchez Asensio and Gil Robles.Andres Gallego 1975, p. 41 The latter fought back appealing to Rome,Rabat√© 1997, p. 179, Cuenca Toribio 1982, p. 168 kept referring to the bishop with venomous ironyRabat√© 1997, p. 183 and confronted him as late as in 1895.El Siglo Futuro 24.01.95, available here In the late 1890s the conflict scaled down as Gil moved away from Integrism and C√°mara turned his ally in showdown against liberal University scholars. Miguel de Unamuno After 1891 death of Mariano Ar√©s Sanz the Salmantine academic realm was almost entirely dominated by conservatives like Gil Robles, Alejandro de la Torre V√©lez and Nicasio S√°nchez Mata.Rodr√≠guez-San Pedro Bezares 2002, p, 254 It was exactly the funeral of Ar√©s which produced confrontation with Miguel de Unamuno, then a young professor of Greek freshly landed in Salamanca.1891 signed a letter supporting the idea of denying funeral academic honors to Ares, quoting law which prevented honors other than those compliant with Religi√≥n del Estado, Rabat√© 1997, p. 136 Gil's address opening the 1891-2 course elicited another backlash, which took shape of 5 Unamuno's articles titled Un nocedalino desquiciado.Rabat√© 1997, pp. 147-8 Written in very aggressive language quite untypical for public disputes between academics of the era, they denounced Gil as a reactionary intending to galvanize the long dead Middle Ages; Unamuno lambasted his opponent as \\"inepto, mediocre y indocto\\" and his address as \\"sudado, artificioso, falso, manera y no estilo\\".Rabat√© 1997, p. 149 Later on Unamuno backtracked, at least in terms of tone,Rabat√© 1997, p. 151 but relations between the two remained tense.Rojas 2001, p. 213 Unamuno soon found an ally in another newcomer academic, Pedro Dorado Montero, in 1897 endangered not only by expulsion from the university, but also by excommunication;the issue was a so-called \\"Tercera cuesti√≥n universitaria\\" (teaching in line with Catholic outlook); in 1897 students denounced Montero as not adhering to the religious principles. Camara demanded that Dorada be expulsed, but the rector quoted constitutional stipulation that no-one will be persecuted for his religious outlook, Rojas 2001, p. 218, S√°nchez P√©rez 2007, pp. 164-6 the two kept reclaiming the local academic realm from the conservatives, the task largely completed after the death of Gil Robles.Ana Chaguaceda Toledano, Miguel de Unamuno.

III Jornadas de Estudio del Carlismo, Estella 2010, , pp. 13-28 Reception and legacy Carlist standard By the end of his life Gil emerged as key Traditionalist thinker and gained a prestigious scholarly position;according to Francisco Giner de los R√≠os, Gil \\"era el escritor y pensador de m√°s s√≥lida formaci√≥n de la escuela cat√≥lica espa√±ola en lo referente a las ciencas pol√≠ticas\\", quoted after Posada 1983, pp. 268-9, and his Tratado de Derecho Politico was above anything written in Catholic Hispanic literature, Rojas 2001, p. 215 however, he did not make it to the top elite of Spanish law academics, as certified by his failures to obtain a chair in Madrid.he has also never entered Real Academia de Jurisprudencia y Legislaci√≥n Following deathhe died due to hemiparesis and his death reverberated in the press of the era, for review of obituaries see Revista cat√≥lica de cuestiones sociales 163 (1908) p. 470 and onwards his memory was first eclipsed and later relegated into oblivion by prolific activity of another Carlist theorist, Juan V√°zquez de Mella.Jos√© Luis Orella Mart√≠nez, El origen del primer Catolicismo social Espa√±ol, [PhD thesis, Universidad de Educaci√≥n a Distancia], Madrid 2012, pp. 36-7 In the 1930s his image was reduced further on to merely \\"a father of Jos√© Maria Gil-Robles\\". After the war neither the regime nor any other political grouping admitted deference to Gil. During revival of the Carlist doctrine in the late Francoist era its key theorists focused on de Mella and referred to Gil casually,see e.g. the writings of Francisco Elias de Tejada or Rafael Gambra. The sole post-war Traditionalist scholar who ventured to develop some threads of Gil‚Äôs work was Marcial Solana; he focused on the autarchy thesis, Jacek Bartyzel, Nic bez Boga, nic wbrew tradycji, Radzymin 2015, , pp. 113, 189‚Äì201 though he was acknowledged as one of the giants of Traditionalism.see the 1970 booklet ¬øQue es el carlismo?, available here, p. 10 Following transici√≥n Traditionalism went dramatically out of fashion and a present-day student refers to Gil as \\"unknown figure, unjustly forgotten\\".\\"figura desconocida, injustamente olvidado\\", Rojas 2001, pp. 213, 227 Apart from an unpublished 1969 PhD thesis and a handful of articles, he has earned no major monograph so far. In the current scholarly discourse as a law theorist Gil is classified as 'iusnaturalista\\" belonging either to the neo-scholasticIndice Historico Espanol Vol. XVIII no 65, Barcelona 1972, p. 451 or neo-thomist school,Montoro Ballesteros, Filosofia y estilo de vida: apunte biografico y perfil intelectual del profesor Mariano Hurtado Bautista, [in:] Antonio Perez Martin (ed.), Funciones y fines del derecho: estudios en homenaje al profesor Mariano Hurtado Bautista, Murcia 1992, , p. 23 indebted to Luigi Taparelli, Jos√© PriscoAntonio Enrique P√©rez Lu√±o, El derecho natural en la Espa√±a del siglo XX, [in:] F.

A peculiar approach is demonstrated by a historian militant in progressist Partido Carlista, who claims that Traiditonalists were aliens who infiltrated the genuine Carlism, compare Jos√© Carlos Clemente Mu√±oz, El carlismo en el novecientos espa√±ol (1876-1936), Madrid 1999, , p. 56 sometimes also as \\"organicista\\",Jos√© Manuel Roca, La derecha furiosa, Madrid 2005, , p. 161 \\"cat√≥lico tradicional\\"Rojas 2001, p. 213 or representative of \\"corporativismo cat√≥lico\\".Laureano L√≥pez Rod√≥, Memorias, Madrid 1990, , p. 143 As a politician Gil is typically labeled either as CarlistGonzalo √Ålvarez Chillida, El antisemitismo en Espa√±a: la imagen del jud√≠o, 1812-2002, Madrid 2002, , p. 227, Jos√© Andr√©s-Gallego, Ant√≥n M.

Some refer to Gil as \\"ora integrista, ora carlista\\", see Victor Manuel Arbeloa, El quiebro del PSOE (1933-1934), vol. 1, Del gobierno a la revoluci√≥n, Madrid 2015, , pp. 98-99 As a public figure he is considered a reactionary.\\"postura inequ√≠vocamente reaccionaria\\" (√Ångel Men√©ndez Rexach, La jefatura del Estado en el derecho p√∫blico espa√±ol, Barcelona 1979, p. 199), \\"uno de los m√°s reaccionarios\\" scholars in Salamanca (V√≠ctor Ouimette, Los intelectuales espa√±oles y el naufragio del liberalismo, 1923-1936, v. 1, Madrid 1998, , p. 246), \\"Cat√≥lico reaccionario\\" (Manuel Jos√© Alonso Garc√≠a, Temas y protagonistas del pensamiento espa√±ol del siglo XX, v. 1, Madrid 2003, , p. 113) According to his sonwho was orphaned by his father at the age of 10 he was \\"a democrat to the core\\";\\"dem√≥crata en lo m√°s profundo del alma\\", which does not prevent Jos√© Mar√≠a from calling his father \\"inquebrantable carlista\\", Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil- Robles, No fue possible la paz, Barcelona 1968, p. 20. He also declared that only lack of overt monarchism divided CEDA from Traditionalism, Garcia Canales 2015, p. 68 Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil-Robles admitted having been politically indebted to his father,during one of his Cortes addresses In the early 1930s a Carlist deputy exclaimed: \\"this is Traditionalism!\\", to which Gil-Robles responded by stating that the Carlists did not possess exclusive rights to Traditionalism but their visions of Christian democracy were entirely incompatible.Gil Robles viewed first papal references to Christian democracy as \\"acci√≥n social ben√©fica\\", sort of Catholic social actitivity and by no means acceptance of \\"the people\\" as a political sovereign, Montoro 1970, pp. 105-7. This approach to papal introduction of the term was fairly typical among Catholic conservatives first faced with the papal initiative, see Jacek Bartyzel, Demokracja chrze≈õcija≈Ñska a konserwaty≈õci (w ≈õwietle nauczania papieskiego), [in:] Jacek Bartyzel, ≈ömiertelny b√≥g demos, Warszawa 2009, , pp. 136-144. Another interpretation offered is that Gil viewed christian democracy as recognition that pueblo (hierarchized) shared sovereignty with a monarch, Gonz√°lez Cuevas 2001, p. 119 Scholars differ when assessing Gil's contribution to Traditionalism. In a very recent historiographical synthesis of the theory he is treated marginally;there are 7 rather casual references in Bartyzel 2015; in comparison, V√°zquez de Mella is mentioned 67 times some see him as merely a \\"sistematizador\\" of earlier thought;mostly Balmes, Cortes and Aparisi - Garcia Canales 1977, p. 44, Garc√≠a Canales 2015, p 25 others view him as a theorist who re-modeled the ideology\\"remodelar los planteamientos del tradicionalismo\\", Javier Ugarte Teller√≠a, El Nacionalismo vasco: Mitos, conmemoraciones y lugares de la memoria, Madrid 2006, , p. 258 and one of the all-time Traditionalist greats.in Marcial Solana, El tradicionalismo pol√≠tico espa√±ol y la ciencia hispana, Madrid 1951, V√°zquez de Mella is mentioned 68 times, Gil Robles 46 times, Ram√≥n Nocedal 25 times, Menendez Pelayo 25 times and Aparisi Guijarro 23 times, referred after Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 370 One student names Gil \\"most systematic doctrinaire of Traditionalism of the early 20th century\\" and considers de Mella his follower.\\"doctrinario m√°s sistem√°tico del tradicionalismo a comienzos del siglo XX\\" - Gonz√°lez Cuevas 2008, p. 1163. For key differences between Gil Robles and V√°zquez de Mella see Bartyzel 2015, p. 140 and Garc√≠a Canales 2015, p. 26 In the Spanish public discourse Gil remains largely unknownthe popular Madrid daily ABC mentioned Enrique Gil Robles only 3 times during 20 years between 1996 and 2016, compare here and hence, unlike some other Traditionalist thinkers, does not generate controversy.most controversial case having been V√≠ctor Pradera In the international realm popular works of mostly foreign historians portrayed him as sort of proto-fascist.especially Paul Preston; \\"sin duda, el historiador brit√°nico no ha le√≠do ni a Enrique Gil Robles, ni a Juan V√°zquez de Mella, ni a V√≠ctor Pradera; y tiende, con su habitual ignorancia, a presentar el carlismo como una especie de remedo del fascismo, sin tener en cuenta el antiestatismo y antitotalitarismo caracter√≠sticos del tradicionalismo carlista\\", Pedro Carlos Gonz√°lez Cuevas, En torno a la obra del hispanista Paul Preston, [in:] Catoblepas 91 (2009), available here Also specialized Spanish scholars, when discussing his general contribution to right-wing thought, despite Gil's vehement hostility towards omnipotent state admit that \\"generic organicist ideas that emerged in a general movement of reflux of individualism, put in front of the social question, eventually facilitated the arrival in the twenties to authoritarian or totalitarian corporatist solutions.\\"Garc√≠a Canales 2015, p. 22 See also * Carlism * Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil- Robles y Qui√±ones * Natural law * University of Salamanca Footnotes Further reading * Miguel Ayuso, El derecho natural hispanico: pasado y presente, Cordoba 2001, * Leopoldo-Santiago Diez Cano, Carlismo en Salamanca en el sexenio: notas sobre un movimiento \\"marginal\\", [in:] Studia historica.

It is a low, spreading shrub with foliage which is shiny when young, angular branches and lilac to purple flowers and which grows in the north-west of Western Australia. Description Eremophila lanceolata is a spreading shrub which grows to a height of with branches that are mostly glabrous, sticky and shiny when young, due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are long, wide, elliptic to lance-shaped, mostly glabrous, sticky and shiny when young. The margins of the leaves often have distinct teeth. The flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils on an S-shaped stalk, usually long. There are 5 overlapping, green, lance-shaped, sepals which are mostly long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is deep lilac to purple on the outside and white with dark purple spots on the inside. The outside of the petal tube is hairy but the inside surface of the lobes is glabrous while the inside of the tube is filled with woolly hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from March to October and the fruits which follow are oval to almost spherical, dry with a hairy, papery covering and are about long.Newman side view of flower Eremophila lanceolata (flower).jpg Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet (lanceolata) is a Latin word meaning \\"lance-like\\". Distribution and habitat Eremophila lanceolata occurs in wide area of the Pilbara and south to Karalundi and between Newman and Mount Augustus in the Gascoyne, Gibson Desert, Little Sandy Desert and Pilbara biogeographic regions. Conservation This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila is an attractive small shrub which will grow well in a container and thrive in areas like Sydney or the coast of Victoria. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting, prefers a well-drained soil but will grow in either full sun or a partially shaded position. It is drought tolerant, although may need occasional watering if grown in a container but needs protection from frost.

The treasury was possibly built as a token of gratitude for a large endowment of wheat offered to Delphi's inhabitants during a lean period. Description The Treasury of Cyrene was probably the last treasury to have been built within the sanctuary of Apollo. It was oriented towards the Temple of Apollo. Its date of construction is estimated at ca. 334‚Äì322 B.C. It was constructed at the eastern part of the precinct, supported by a base (crepis) made of limestone and consisting of three steps. The elevation of the treasury was made of two kinds of marble with provenance from Paros and Mount Pentelikon. It was built in the Doric order, distyle in antis, with a vestibule and a cella. The antae were provided with semi-columns on their interior side. The building was covered by a marble roof, the sima of which was decorated with gargoyles in alternating forms (lion heads and simple tubes).Bommelaer, J.-F., (1991),Laroche, D., Guide de Delphes, Le site, Paris, pp. 156‚Äì157 An inscription on the north anta mentions that the Cyreneans were accorded the promanteia by the city of Delphi, as a sign of gratitude for a heavy load of wheat that the former offered the latter during a period of famine. Cyrene was a wheat-producing region throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods. In front of the treasury there was a small square and to its south was discovered a building which was formerly identified as the prytaneion.

The current lighthouse tower is the third to be constructed on the rocky headland of Punta Arinaga, near the town of the same name in the municipality of Ag√ºimes. Arinaga is on the south- east side of the island and marks the coastline between the Maspalomas lighthouse to the south and the Punta de Melenara lighthouse of Telde to the north.  History  The first lighthouse was completed in 1897, as part of the first maritime lighting plan for the Canaries, built in a similar style to other Canarian 19th century lights, it consists of a white washed single storey building, with dark volcanic rock used for the masonry detailing. The light was shown from a lantern room at the top of a six-metre-high () masonry tower, attached to the seaward side of the house, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. It remained in service until it was replaced in the 1960s by a new taller tower, which was connected to the side of the original station. Photographs show that this second tower was removed in the recent refurbishment and renovation of the original building. The third lighthouse which was also built nearby, first entered service in 1984. This active light consists of a cylinder-shaped tower, which supports twin galleries and the lantern. The tower is predominantly white, but with three red bands. The lantern emits both red and white light, varying with direction, at a focal height of 47 m above sea level. The white light can be seen for 12 nautical miles and the red for nine. Its light characteristic is made up of three flashes every ten seconds. The lighthouse is not connected to the electricity grid, but instead is powered by six solar panels charging a set of batteries. The 2.25 m lantern is equipped with a 100 W halogen lamp, producing the red and white light. Maintained by the Port authority of Las Palmas, it is registered under the international Admiralty number D2812 and has the NGA identifier of 113-24008.  Renovation  Renovated original lighthouse in 2012 The old lighthouse building was handed over to the local council of Ag√ºimes, who carried out a comprehensive restoration, culminating in an opening ceremony hosted by the local major in March 2011. It was expected that the 750,000 euro refurbishment of the keeper's quarters would enable the historical structure to be used as a high quality restaurant. Over a four-year period the council advertised three different tenders to operate and manage a restaurant business at the site, the last one in late 2014, but there were no successful bidders until 2016. The Restaurante Faro de Arinaga opened in August 2016 with a concession to operate for fifteen years. With an emphasis on Canarian-Mediterranean cuisine the restaurant can seat 120 diners within the renovated building and 80 on the exterior terrace.

Biography Palm, who comes from Malmk√∂ping, was a quarter-finalist at the Copenhagen Open in 1976. Later in the year he upset Mark Edmondson in the 1976 Swedish Open, then in the 1976 Stockholm Open held a match point in the second round against Mark Cox, who went on to win the tournament. A Swedish Davis Cup representative, Palm was picked to play for his country in a tie against Monaco in Uppsala in April, 1977. He featured in the doubles rubber with Jan Norb√§ck, which they won over Bernard Balleret and Louis Borfiga, to secure the tie. Palm made his first singles appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at the 1977 Wimbledon Championships. He beat West German player Frank Gebert in the opening round, then lost a five set second round match to Paul Kronk. After making a Grand Prix quarter-final, at Maui, Palm ended the 1977 season by competing in the December edition of the Australian Open (there had also been a tournament in January). On this occasion he was unable to get past the first round and lasted only one set against Alvin Gardiner before he had to retire hurt. Palm returned to Wimbledon in 1978 and lost to Buster Mottram in opening round. The match was played before a large police presence due to demonstrators who had turned up to protest against Mottram's support of the National Front Party. He also competed in men's doubles at the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open during his career, all with Jan Norb√§ck. His best performance in a Grand Prix tournament came at Linz in 1979, when he had wins over Patrice Dominguez, Markus G√ºnthardt and Louk Sanders to make the semi-finals.

Shepseskare, a Pharaoh about whom almost nothing is known, who is known only from a single roughly contemporary seal impression from the mortuary temple of Neferefre, has been suggested as the pyramid's builder.  Exploration  The structure was first discovered at the beginning of the 1980s by a Czech archaeological team led by Miroslav Verner, who noticed the levelled ground and the pit. Additional elements of the complex could not be found. = Date = The site cannot be directly connected with any ruler, since the few finds from the site did not include any inscriptions. An inferential assignment to Shepseskare is based on the location of the site in the necropolis. Because of the proximity of the area to the Pyramid of Sahure and the Sun temple of Userkaf, Verner suggested that Shepseskare belonged to the same branch of the royal family as these two rulers. The chronological position of Shepseskare is not entirely clear. While Manetho lists him in the Aegyptiaca as a successor of Neferirkare, the discovery of a seal impression in the Mortuary temple of Neferefre suggests that he was Neferefre'ssuccessor and completed his sun temple. The arrangement as successor of Neferefre is consistent with the fact that Neferefre was able to begin construction on the same orientation towards Heliopolis, while for his successors this was no longer possible due to space limitations.  Construction  When Shepseskare came to power, there were already three pyramids in the necropolis of Abusir. These were arranged with their northwest corners in a line, probably pointing to the obelisk of Heliopolis (the so-called \\"Abusir Diagonal\\"). To maintain this orientation, Shepseskare would have had to erect his pyramid even further into the desert than the unfinished Pyramid of Neferefre, which would have made the transport of materials difficult. Instead he chose an area northwest of the Pyramid of Sahure, halfway to the Sun temple of Userkaf, as his building site. Shepseskare died after only a short reign, which led to the abandonment of construction. His successor Niuserre did not carry out any further work on this tomb. The location of Shepseskare's interment is unknown, but it is assumed that he was not buried in this barely started tomb.  Pyramid  Construction of the actual pyramid structure was never begun. Only the levelling of the terrain to a flat, square area was carried out. In the middle of the levelled area is a T-shaped pit, in which the burial chamber and its entranceway would have been installed. The dimensions of the levelled area and the pit allow it to be suggested that the building would have been a similar size to the Pyramid of Neferirkare (105 m x 105 m) and thus that it was planned to be the second largest tomb at Abusir, after the pyramid of Neferirkare. The actual dimensions are not recoverable, since stonework had not yet been installed. Additionally, the slope of the sides and thus the planned height is unknowable due to the lack of cladding stones. Remains of a pyramid complex including the traditional elements of the mortuary temple, temenos wall, cult pyramid, causeway and valley temple were not found. These components were probably never begun, since they would have got in the way of the building work on the pyramid during the early stages of construction.

This new discipline was first proposedBiography, Patricia E. Bath, NIH by Dr. Patricia E. Bath in 1978 after observations of epidemics rates of preventable blindness among under-served populations in urban areas in the US as well as under-served populations in so called third-world countries.Bath PE (May 1978). \\"Blindness Prevention Through Program in Community Ophthalmology in Developing Countries\\", Excerpta Medica Series 442, Amsterdam, Oxford CCIII International Congress of Ophthalmology, 1913- 1915. The failure of hospital based eye care to provide preventive services for at risk populations was evidenced by the high rates of blindness due to preventable causes. Moreover, government institutional based public health facilities were not equipped to prevent or treat the at risk populations because the system wide infrastructure lacked personnel capable of delivery of services for eye health education and eye health care. Subspecialities of ophthalmology Historically, public health departments had staff of physicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, environmentalists and perhaps microbiologists. The disciplines included in public health services were maternal and child health, nutrition, family planning, and sanitation and environment. Hospital and public health institutions viewed ophthalmology (i.e. eye care services) as a tertiary health care to be delivered solely by ophthalmologists. The basic public health services included pediatricians, obstetricians, gynecologists, family practice physicians, environment/sanitation specialists as well as nurses and midwives but no ophthalmic assistants. Blindness In the discipline of community ophthalmology, the new cadre of personnel known as eye health care workers, eye health care educators or ophthalmic assistants are trained to provide eye care and blindness prevention services at the village or door- to-door level. For example, in villages with endemic trachoma the eye care health workers would educate families about the importance of sanitation and hand washing and also provide access to eye drops. In areas with high rates of blindness due to cataract this cadre of personnel would educate families about the cure for blindness due to cataract with eye surgery. Changing the belief that blindness is an inevitable consequence of aging requires community eye health education about curable blindness and preventable blindness which is still so necessary in many parts of the world. Community ophthalmology teachings include the concept of primary eye care which has been advocated as both as a stand alone health service as well as a new integral component of basic health services or public health services.Guide Pour Les Programmes De Prevention De Cecite, WHO, 1979 Basic health services This new concept has been shown to be a sight saving blindness prevention strategy. Since inception in 1978, programs of community ophthalmology have been developed worldwide. The promulgation of programs of community ophthalmology can be traced through programs of WHO,Report of the 11th meeting of the WHO Programme Advisory Group on the Prevention of Blindness: WHO PBL /95.51 NGOs like AiPb,American Institute for the prevention of Blindness (AiPb) www.blindnessprevention.org and through the effort of individuals such as Professor Cornelius Odarquaye Quarcoopome in Africa and Professor Kirmani in Asia and Professor Bath worldwide.

The treasury itself replaced two former buildings, namely the tholos and the monopteros, built by the same city at an earlier stage within the 6th century. The earlier buildings were related to the Orthagorids of Sicyon and particularly to the victories of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon in the course of the First Sacred War and their replacement probably marks the change in tide in Sicyonian politics. Description The Sicyonian Treasury is in fact a generic name, signifying three different buildings of the 6th century B.C.Bommelaer, J.-F., Laroche, D., 1991, Guide de Delphes. Le site, pp. 119‚Äì122 =The tholos= The tholos of the Sicyonians was probably the oldest construction, dating to ca 580 B.C. and built right after the First Sacred War at the instigation of the tyrant of Sicyon Cleisthenes, who was the most prominent leader in that war. It measured 6.3 meters at the base and 3.54 meters at the floor level and was surrounded by a colonnade consisting of 13 Doric columns and a Doric architrave. The cella was circular, made of ashlar masonry with a single door. The height of the walls was 4.04 meters. The shape of its roof is conjectural as nothing has been preserved. =The monopteros= The monopteros of the Sicyonians, as signified by its name, was a relatively small building (4√ó5 meters) with a single row of 14 columns (pteron). The columns were monolithic, i.e. they consisted of single blocks of limestone, and measured 2.78 meters in height; they supported the roof directly, without any intervening walls. The architrave was decorated with a frieze with scenes in relief, inspired by heroic themes. The discovery of these sculptures buried under the Treasury of the late sixth century helped scholars date the monopteros to ca. 560 B.C. The building looked more like a shelter and thus it led to the conjecture that it hosted a precious and fragile ex voto, possibly the chariot with which Cleisthenes won at the first Pythian Games of 582 BC. The sculptures of the metopes of the monopteros constitute excellent specimens of archaic reliefs. They are inspired by mythology: the journey of Phrixus and Helle, the Argonauts' expedition, the abduction of Europa by Zeus, the Dioskouroi, the hunt of the Calydonian boar. The metopes were painted over in bright colours, creating a strong decorative impression. =The Treasury= The actual treasury was built in the Doric order and was distyle in antis, with vestibule and cella. It measured 8.27√ó6.24 meters and lay on a foundation made of poros stone quarried in Corinthia. Its orientation was the same as that of the Siphnian Treasury to which it was probably contemporary (ca. 525 B.C.). The monument was visible from the entrance to the sanctuary. Historians believe that it was constructed by the demos of Sicyon when the Orthagorids were forced to demise, in order to mark the change in Sicyonian politics. Despite the fact that the two former buildings were deliberately destroyed, their architectural members were not dispersed or reused, but rather buried under the foundations of the Treasury.Nenna, M.-D., Laroche, D., 1990,\\"Le tr√©sor de Sicyone et ses fondations\\", BCH 114, pp. 241‚Äì284 References Bibliography *Bommelaer, J.-F., Laroche, D., 1991, Guide de Delphes.

The 61st Rifle Corps was formed firmed in Tula during September 1939. After Operation Barbarossa, it was transferred to the front in Belarus and fought in the Battle of Smolensk. After suffering heavy losses at Smolensk, it was disbanded in early August 1941. Reformed in spring 1943, the corps fought in Operation Kutuzov, the Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive and the Berlin Offensive. The corps was disbanded after the end of the war in summer 1945.  First formation  The corps was formed in September 1939. It was stationed near Tula. The corps was commanded by Major General Fyodor Bakunin from April 1940. The corps began the war as part of the 20th Army. After the beginning of the war, it was moved to Belarus south of Mogilev and took defensive positions in the area of ≈†k≈Çou, Mogilev and Bykhaw. From June 1941, the corps fought in the Battle of Smolensk. During the battle, it defended Mogilev and fought for Smolensk. On 1 July, it was composed of the 18th, 110th and 172nd Rifle Divisions. On 3 July, the vanguard of the 2nd Panzer Army reached the approaches to Mogilev and fought with the outposts of the corps. On 7 July 1941, it was composed of the 53rd, 110th and 172nd Rifle Divisions. On the same day, the division moved to a defensive line on the banks of the Dnieper north of Mogilev. The new positions were on the line of Shklo≈≠, Mogilev and Buinichi. Around this time, the corps was subordinated to the 13th Army. On 10 July, the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich of Heinrich von Vietinghoff's XXXXVI Motorized Corps advanced to the Dnieper in the Mogilev area. 10th Panzer Division also advanced to the river in the Shklov area. The 10th Panzer Division soon crossed the Dnieper and routed the corps' 53rd Rifle Division, capturing a bridgehead. Troops of the 61st Rifle Corps, 20th Mechanized Corps and 4th Airborne Corps were pushed back by the German advances. On 13 July, corps commander Bakunin was ordered to attack the 10th Panzer Division's bridgehead using the 110th Rifle Division and the 20th Mechanized Corps. The 20th Mechanized Corps was not equipped with tanks and did not have time to concentrate forces. As a result, the attack was repulsed. By 15 July, Mogilev was loosely encircled. It was now defended by the 61st Rifle Corps, most of the 20th Rifle Corps, remnants of the 148th and 187th Rifle Divisions, the 1st Motor Rifle Division, and the 26th and 38th Tank Divisions, as well as the 210th Motorized Division of the 20th Mechanized Corps. On 17 July, the corps was concentrated in the area of Horoditshe, Dubrovka and Ordat. In the morning it attacked towards Kopys, but was stopped by German infantry from IX Army Corps. By 21 July, the corps composed most of the forces defending Mogilev and was surrounded by German troops. The 20th Mechanized Corps defended Tcherniavka, Ruditsy, Ordat and Horoditshe. The 110th Rifle Division defended Horoditshe, Kniazhitsy, Pletshitsy and Mostok. The remnants of the 137th Rifle Division defended near the village of Sukhari. On 23 July, the corps was forced to retreat to the line of Konstantinovka and Kamenka. Headquarters also lost contact with the 172nd Rifle Division, defending Mogilev. Under heavy attack from German troops and without resupply, the corps had retreated into the center of Mogilev by 24 July. The corps ran out of ammunition, food and fuel supplies by 25 July. Despite orders to the contrary from higher headquarters, Bakunin ordered the 61st Corps to break out of the encirclement towards Mstislavl and Roslavl on the night of 26‚Äì27 July. The 20th Mechanized Corps would advance in the vanguard and the most combat- ready troops of the 110th Rifle Division would form the rear guard. 172nd Rifle Division commander Major General Mikhail Romanov decided to break out of positions in Mogilev on his own. By this time, the remnants of the 1st Motor Rifle Division, 161st Rifle Division and other 20th Army units were in the corps positions. The wounded were left behind in the city. However, most of the 61st Rifle Corps was captured in the breakout attempt. After two days of heavy fighting and the total defeat of the corps, Bakunin ordered the remnants of the corps to move east in small groups. Bakunin personally led 140 troops of the corps out of the encirclement. The 61st Rifle Corps was disbanded on 5 August 1941, although it had ceased to exist as an organized unit during the breakout from Mogilev.  Second formation  The Corps was formed in the spring of 1943. It was part of the active army from 12 July 1943. At the time, the corps included the 51st, 62nd and 119th Rifle Divisions. The corps began combat on the Western Front with the 21st Army. It fought in Operation Suvorov. After fighting in the operation during the summer and early fall, the corps headquarters was transferred to the reserve. From April to May 1944, the corps attacked towards Orsha and Mogilev. At the beginning of May, the corps was composed of the 134th, 247th and 274th Rifle Divisions. On 22 May, corps commander Major General Alexander Ilyin was mortally wounded when his vehicle struck a mine and died of his wounds on 28 May. Ilyin was replaced in command by Major General Ivan Grigoryevsky. The corps was stationed north of Volodymyr-Volynsky and was part of the 69th Army of the 1st Belorussian Front. During the Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive, the corps advanced on the left flank of the 1st Belorussian Front, providing a link with the 1st Belorussian Front's 3rd Guards Army. On 20 July, elements of the corps crossed the Bug River in the Kladno, Jasienica, and Zagurnik areas. These units attacked towards Lublin. On 29 July, assault battalions of the 61st and 91st Rifle Corps crossed the Vistula near Pu≈Çawy, where they captured a bridgehead on the western bank. This bridgehead would later become known as the Pu≈Çawy Bridgehead. By 1 August, the 134th Rifle Division had captured Bzhestse and had repulsed German counterattacks. The corps began to expand the bridgehead, advancing to Nasiluv and Janowiec. In January 1945, the corps broke out of the bridgehead in the East Prussian Offensive. On 14 January, assault battalions launched the offensive and broke through German lines by the end of the day. The 11th Tank Corps attacked through the break in the German lines. With tank support, the 134th and 274th Rifle Divisions of the corps captured Radom on 16 January. The corps continued the offensive and crossed the Pilica and Warta. It also captured Tomasz√≥w Lubelski and Jarocin. By the end of January, it reached the Oder north of Frankfurt-an-der-Oder. By Stavka Order No. 9 of 19 February 1945, the corps was given the honorific \\"Radom\\" for its actions in the offensive.Stavka Order No. 9, 19 February 1945 In April 1945, the corps fought in the Berlin Offensive. On 16 April, the corps went on the offensive from its bridgehead north of Frankfurt and broke through German lines. During the offensive, it reached the Spree near F√ºrstenwalde, where large German forces were positioned. The corps then fought in the Battle of Halbe against the encircled 9th Army. By 25 April, the 9th Army was pushed back to Luckenwalde, where it was destroyed. On 26 April, the 61st Rifle Corps captured Treuenbrietzen and advanced to the Elbe near Magdeburg. On 1 May, it linked up with American troops. An order of 29 May 1945, connected to the formation of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, ordered the disbandment of a number of rifle corps, including the 61st.Stavka Order No. 11095  Corps command  Command appointments within the corps were as follows: Commander: * Major General F.A.Bakunin * Major General A.M.

Biography  He was the son of Joaquim de Oliveira and Maria Joaquina Braz de Oliveira. At an early age, he, along with his siblings, were sent to Fundada, to live with their paternal grandparents. There, under the care of his uncles, Jo√£o and Sebasti√£o de Oliveira Xavier and Aniceto de Oliveira, he received the rudimentary theological instruction. In 1871, he was sent to the neighbouring village of Sert√£ to study Latin, with Father Joaquim Pedro Pereira, a distinguished professor, before completing his Latin exam at the Liceu de Santar√©m (lyceum of Santar√©m). In October 1874, he entered the Semin√°rio Patriarcal de Santar√©m (Patriarchal Seminary of Santar√©m) to study the ecclesiastical sciences. Once his theological studies were concluded, in October 1879, he went to Castelo Branco (seat of the Diocese) and prepared to receive religious orders, along with his brothers. Ordained presbytery on 11 June 1881, he continued on to Coimbra; in October he registered for theology studies at the university, studying with distinction and concluding in 1888. In addition to inheriting the chaplaincy at the Convent of Santa Clara, he presided as the president of the Conference of the St. Vincent de Paul, the philanthropic association constituted by students. In October 1888, he was appointed professor of ecclesiastical and preparatory studies, as well as spiritual director at the Col√©gio das Miss√µes Ultramarinas (College of Overseas Missions) in Cernache do Bonjardim. He held this position until 1893. =Missionary= In 1893, the Patriarch of the East Indies, D. Ant√≥nio Sebasti√£o Valente, returned to Portugal on sabbatical, in order to alleviate his failing health. Recognizing his abilities, he invited Bishop Mateus to be his private secretary. Oliveira Xavier accepted the position and left for Portuguese India on 11 January 1884, arriving on 5 March in Goa. On 7 November D. Mateus Xavier was named missionary for the Patriarchy of India. He landed in Cochim on 18 February 1894 and visited the suffragan diocese, then governed by D. Jo√£o Gomes Ferreira, before carrying-on to Goa. There, in addition to his duties, he was nominated metropolitan and pontifical judge, before finally being elected rector of the Rachol Seminary in June 1894. Undertaking a vast series of reforms at the seminary, he established a preparatory school that concentrated in theological studies. With further authorization from the government and pontificate, he created a theology faculty, turing the Rachol Seminary into primary and best institution in India. =Bishop= A view of the S√© Cathedral of Goa, reconstructed through initiatives of the former Bishop of Cochim Following the death of Bishop D. Jo√£o Gomes Ferreira, D. Mateus Xavier was nominated to replace him as the Bishop of Cochim on 11 October 1897. D. Ant√≥nio Sebasti√£o Valente and the Minister of the Navy, Henrique de Barros Gomes, supported his nomination, which was confirmed on 11 October 1897 by Pope Leo XIII. Since the Papal bulls were slow to reach India, the episcopal consecration was only held on 30 January 1898, in the S√© Cathedral of Goa. He arrived in the Diocese on 5 March, making his solemn entry to take possession of his diocese. His first act in the Diocese was to re-begin work on the new cathedral, whose central nave fell into ruin following a stormy night: D. Mateus Xavier, therefore, had no cathedral to preach from, when he arrived. Furthermore, the Christians in the area were embroiled in controversies associated with the caste system. He sought to resolve or arbitrate many of the issues of these Christians, opening the local churches and continued work on the cathedral. The cathedral, which was constructed in a nondescript style, that mixed Manueline and Indian ornamentation. Work on the site began in the middle of 1898. It was re-opened for worship of the Te Deum marking the coronation of Pope Pius X on 9 August 1903, eventually solemnly consecrated on 19 November 1905, assisted by patriarch D. Ant√≥nio Sebasti√£o Valente, local and neighbouring bishops (a total of 11 prelates). D. Mateus Xavier contributed to the advancement of local education, expanding local schools and elevating smaller schools to lyceums, contracting 15 and 20 teachers, establishing full preparatory instruction that allowed entry to Indian universities. Later, these official schools were aggregated into the University of Madrasta, receiving subsidies from English government, under appropriate conditions. =Later life= By decree on 31 December 1908, after the death of D. Ant√≥nio Sebasti√£o Valente, Bishop Mateus was elevated to Archbishop of Goa and Patriarch of the East Indies (on 26 February 1909), a position he held until his death, on 19 May 1929. In 1928, with the addition of Diocese of Daman, the archbishopric was expanded, and D. Mateus Xavier became the Archbishop of Goa and Daman.

Background After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the House and Senate required that all men in the age range 20 to 44 years inclusive, register for the draft and Crosby, who was then aged 38, duly did so. From interviews he gave around that time he fully expected to be called up. However, as a married man with dependents, he was a long way down the priority list for being drafted. Crosby wanted to do as much as possible for the war effort pending being drafted but it soon became evident that he was unlikely to be conscripted because of his age and his family. It does seem that he was very embarrassed at not being called up and it was evidently decided that he could do more to help the war effort by entertaining and boosting war bond sales than by being in uniform. Crosby's embarrassment about his absence from the armed forces ended on December 5, 1942 when the War Dept. suspended induction of men 38 years of age or older. On January 29, 1942, in response to a request from General MacArthur on behalf of his soldiers, Crosby sent his Kraft Music Hall radio show by shortwave to the American forces besieged in the Philippines at Corregidor. He dedicated the opening song ‚ÄúThe Caissons Go Rolling Along‚Äù to the Philippine defenders. The War Department subsequently established the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) on May 26, 1942 to keep American forces informed and entertained and Crosby was quick to become involved. Within days, he recorded his first guest shot in a Command Performance show. The Command Performance series was recorded weekly on transcription discs for shipment to overseas forces instead of being broadcast live, and Crosby's experience of recording for radio in this way was to have a major impact on his show-business activities after the war when he pushed hard to be allowed to record his shows. This led to a break with his long-running Kraft Music Hall show and a switch to Philco Radio Time. Other major weekly AFRS shows were Mail Call and GI Journal, and the singer was a regular participant in these too. On March 8, 1943, Time magazine said, \\"The best in radio‚Äîand a lot of it‚Äîgoes to U.S. forces at the fighting fronts. They have received over 1,000 special programs which U.S. radio fans would give plenty to hear. Forty-odd shows a week are heard only by the armed forces.\\" Crosby Involvement Armed Forces Radio Service shows in which Crosby participated during wartime (December 7, 1941 - August 15, 1945) totalled more than 70 and included Command Performance (30 appearances), Mail Call (13 appearances), GI Journal (19 appearances), Song Sheet (at least 5 appearances), Personal Album (many appearances), Front Line Theatre, and Jubilee (at least twice). In addition his regular Kraft Music Hall show was transcribed for the Armed Forces. In the three years eight months of the war, Crosby made eight full- length films, twelve short films (including guest appearances, appeared in at least 190 other radio programs, recorded 160 songs for commercial release and out of these an incredible 54 were top thirty hits including nine which reached No. 1. In addition his songs ‚ÄúWhite Christmas‚Äù and ‚ÄúSwinging on a Star‚Äù won the Oscar for the best film song of their respective years. A total of 71 V-discs were issued containing his material, some of which was specially recorded. In all, Crosby spent a total of 25 weeks touring to entertain servicemen without adding in his numerous weekend trips. His fund-raising activities resulted in the sales of millions of dollars of war bonds and he raised substantial amounts for the USO, Red Cross and other charities.

It serves as an advertising jingle for a collaboration between streaming music service Yonder Music and telecom provider Celcom Axiata, with a view to promoting the former's music streaming service exclusively available on the latter's mobile telecommunication services in Malaysia and Indonesia. While \\"Kau Ilhamku\\" was originally written by Asmin Mudin for Man Bai in 1993, it was reworked by J-Key and Russell Curtis into an R&B; and pop rendition after it received the approval from Man Bai himself. Yonder Music's CEO Adam Kidron handpicked the song himself, citing its catchy rhythm and its status with the Malaysian people as an inspirational song as his reasons for doing so. \\"Kau Ilhamku\\" was made available exclusively for streaming on the Yonder Music mobile app on 18 November 2015 alongside its music video on Celcom and Yonder Music's YouTube accounts. On 19 November 2015, the musical composition was first performed live at The Garage KL in Ulu Klang. Background and recording \\"Kau Ilhamku\\" is a reworked song of the same name that was composed by Asmin Mudin and sung by Man Bai. Man Bai was given the demo of \\"Kau Ilhamku\\" by Asmin in 1993, before it was included on his self-titled album in 1995. 20 years later, in September 2015, Man Bai was contacted by Yonder Music, which showed interest in rerecording the song, albeit in a rearranged manner. On the news of rerecording the song, Man Bai commented, \\"Around two months ago, I was contacted by them [Yonder Music] who appeared interested in reworking \\"Kau Ilhamku\\". They like the melody. I agreed [for them to rerecord it] as long as they don't change the original melody of the song. What is more special is that it involves popular local and international artists.\\" Man Bai later recorded his vocals for the new version of \\"Kau Ilhamku\\" in October 2015. Siti Nurhaliza, another artist involved in the creation of the new song, also revealed that she had finished recording her part in the same month. She commented, \\"When everything was agreed upon, we did my parts in October. Originally I sang the song in its entirety with the new music arrangement. But in the end, the parts [of the song] where I would sing [that were included in the final version] were decided by the producers.\\" Over the course of the months, the new version of \\"Kau Ilhamku\\" was recorded and produced in various cities and countries including Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, and New York City. It was also agreed upon that proceeds from the musical single would be transferred to Yonder Music Trust, a non-profit trust which main interest is to help music education organizations as well as providing help for groups of people in need. The artistes who were involved in this project have also donated RM 300 000 to the fund. Composition and lyrics Originally written in Bahasa Malaysia, the reworked song ended up being four minutes and fifty two seconds long, with its genre holding the middle between pop and R&B.; Some rap verses in English were also included. Produced by J-Key and Russell Curtis, \\"Kau Ilhamku\\" was handpicked by Adam Kidron, Yonder Music's CEO. Kidron thought highly of the song's catchy rhythm, as well as its popularity amongst Malaysians as an inspirational song.

Celcom's and Yonder Music's official YouTube accounts released the accompanying music video the same day. Critical response A reviewer from Malaysian Digest gave the song a mixed review. The reviewer commented, \\"Having top singers singing a hit song in a collaborative effort is a plus point, but on the other hand, breaking it down with a bridge in English and rap, may have just taken away the sweet and simple sound of an already beautiful tune.\\" Music video =Background and release= The first frame shows Man Bai, the original singer of \\"Kau Ilhamku\\".

It was run by former bush pilot Bryan Greenberger. It had come into existence in 1974 when Greenberger had successfully tendered for the Sydney to Lord Howe Island route that had been vacated when Ansett Airlines subsidiary Airlines of New South Wales had withdrawn its flying boat service, but lacked an aircraft to operate it. He went into partnership with Sydney builder Alan Griffin, which gave him access to a Beechcraft airplane, and they commenced what became a lucrative operation. The company was half-owned by Greenberger and half- owned by the Griffin family, with Greenberger as managing director, Griffin as chairman, and Griffin's son-in-law Jim Read as director. The airline saw an early incident in 1976 when a Lord Howe Island flight was forced to return to Sydney Airport after takeoff when a damaged engine resulted in smoke coming from the engine and pieces of metal falling from the plane. By 1978, the airline had four aircraft, was operating from a converted hangar at Sydney Airport. In that year, it also operated flights within New South Wales to Lord Howe Island, Temora, Condobolin, Scone, Quirindi, Gunnedah and Wee Waa. It had recently expanded to operate discount flights to Toowoomba in Queensland in competition with major airlines and an existing regional carrier; these reportedly \\"proved particularly popular\\". Their operation was based on the \\"no-frills\\" style of English entrepreneur Freddie Laker, with no food or drink or hostess. The company launched an aggressive advertising campaign in Sydney newspapers in 1978, and Greenberger had expansion plans to Geelong in Victoria and the Sunshine Coast in Queensland if the Toowoomba route succeeded. He had also speculated that Advance could become a third major domestic carrier alongside Ansett Airlines and Trans Australia Airlines were Australia's dual- airline system to collapse. On 21 February 1980, the airline's scheduled passenger flight Advance Airlines Flight DR4210 crashed at Sydney Airport after an engine failure on takeoff, killing all 13 people on board the Beech Beechcraft King Air 200. The crash resulted in a 1982 board of inquiry which made a number of recommendations about airline safety in Australia. At the time of the crash, Advance Airlines had a fleet of five Beechcraft King Air aircraft operating its routes. The airline had a subsequent incident while still in operation in December 1980 when a pilot collapsed unconscious while operating a Lord Howe Island flight, which resulted in a passenger having to take control of the aircraft to avoid a crash, and made front-page news in Sydney.

He played a role in the trial of Thomas Muir of Huntershill in 1793. Kay drew him and dubbed him the Pension Hunter at the trial.Kay‚Äôs Originals Vol.2, p.113 Life He was born on 12 June 1750, the son of John Lapslie, a tackman and tenant of Bencloich Mill, and his wife, Margaret Lockhart (1730-1754) who died when James was only four. His father remarried and thereafter he seemed distant from both father and step-mother. His father did however encourage his interest in the ministry and supported his study of Divinity at Glasgow University.http://www.welcometolennoxtown.co.uk/campsonians.htm He undertook a Grand Tour of Europe with Sir James Suttie, who afterwards afforded him many good social connections. He became minister of Campsie on 27 November 1783, taking over from Rev William Bell. He held his post for 41 years. His first appearance in British history is in 1785 at the descent of the first hot-air balloon in Campsie, where Lapslie met the famous Vincent Lunardi upon his arrival.http://www.welcometolennoxtown.co.uk/campsonians.htm In November 1792, in the wake of the French Revolution, a number of Friends of the People organisations were set up in Scotland (also known as Reform Societies). The local calico printing industry proved a centre for these groups in Kirkintilloch and Milton of Campsie. At the infamous trial of Thomas Muir, Lapslie appeared as an uncalled witness to speak against Muir, despite being a friend of the Muir family and established a firmly anti-democratic stance, stressing the dangers of democracy. In this he stood in opposition to Rev. William Dunn who took the pro-democratic stance. Lapslie appears to have been able to cross-examine Muir at some point, fooling the presiding Lord Armadale into believing that he had some legitimate presence.Kays Originals, vol.2, p.112 Muir strongly objected to Lapslie‚Äôs appearance, and the court upheld this objection and continued without Lapslie‚Äôs evidence.http://www.welcometolennoxtown.co.uk/campsonians.htm This action led to Lapslie‚Äôs actions being put to verse: My name is James Lapslie, I preach and I pray And as an Informer, I expect good pay In 1797 he also engaged himself in debate upon the Militia Act of that year. He also famously and strangely spoke out against the use of Sunday schools, as he also saw these as a means of spreading the concept of democracy. In 1816 Rev Lapslie appears as a \\"fine orator\\" at the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in Edinburgh, speaking in defence of a fellow minister accused of indiscretions with his housekeeper. He died suddenly on 11 December 1824 at the Star Inn on Ingram Street in Glasgow (home of the Glasgow Society of Friends). His ministry was continued by Rev Dr Norman MacLeod. His funeral at Clachan of Campsie was interrupted by his debtors, who insisted on payment before the service completed. These were paid by Sir John Stirling.

The \\"Great Excavation\\" (La Grande Fouille) lasted 10 years and was concluded by the creation of the first museum on-site. In the years to follow, the site never ceased to be excavated and investigated. Several of the monuments were restored and new interpretations continue to see the light in the academic field. The rediscovery of Delphi In the course of the Ottoman period the archaeological site of Delphi was often visited by European travelers, inspired by the Renaissance spirit. The first one was Cyriacus of Ancona in 1436. The backwater village of Kastri in Phocis became renowned through their descriptions, sketches and engravings. Yet, although the site of ancient Delphi had been securely identified, it was very difficult to start a systematic excavation, as the expropriation of an entire village was almost impossible given the meager finances of the newly founded Greek State. Some trial sections had taken place in 1840 and 1860 around the polygonal wall. An earthquake in 1870, however, created new hopes. The village was left derelict after it and in 1880 B. Haussoulier managed to start excavating the Portico of the Athenians.acquemin, A. (ed), 2000, Delphes Cent Ans apr√®s la Grande fouille. Essai de bilan. Actes du colloque organis√© par l'EFA, 17-20 septembre 1992, BCH suppl√©ment 36 The Great Excavation Under Charilaos Trikoupis the Greek state got on the track of modernization and long-term planning. A close collaboration between France and Greece was achieved, part of which was on the field of cultural heritage and archaeology. Thus, in 1892, under the auspices of the French Archaeological School, started the ‚ÄúGreat excavation‚Äù (La Grande Fouille). Great, not only in length of time, but also in what regarded the extent, the difficulty, the number of people who were mobilized and, of course, the number and importance of the monuments and finds discovered. The diary of this amazing effort has been digitized by the French Archaeological School at Athens offering a glimpse at the fascinating and copious efforts of the archaeological team, which comprised members of various nationalities.http://www.ressources-en-ligne.efa.gr/Delphes/Delphes/ The entire village of Kastri was transferred to the location where now lies the village of Delphi. The technical teams provided the site with a mini-railway with wagonets, in order to remove the debris, and started demolishing the old houses. After all the preparatory work, the actual excavation started in mid- October 1892, quite late in autumn, and therefore it did not last for long. The next season, however, started in April 1893, revealing large part of the Treasury of the Athenians as well as Sibyl's Rock and the Altar of the Chians. Within the next years came to light most of the buildings along the Sacred Way as well as unique sculptures. One of the most exciting moments was the discovery of the Charioteer, part of the monumental bronze sculpture dedicated by the tyrant of Gela, Polyzalos, in order to commemorate his victory at the Pythian Games. Other highlights of the excavations were the discovery of the Dancers of Delphi as well as of the Roman statue of Antinous and of the pair of archaic kouroi (Dioskouroi or Kleobis and Biton). After revealing the monuments within the sanctuary of Apollo the archaeologists started excavating the stadium and the gymnasium and then moved on to the so-called ‚ÄúMarmaria‚Äù, i.e. the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia, from where the locals used to pick building material for centuries. The team of the archaeologists comprised several big names of French scholarship, such as the director Th. Homolle, the architect A. Tournaire, Henri Corvet, P. Perdrizet, and academics such as Th. Reinach and H. Weil, who undertook the study and enhancement of the epigraphic material. However, it was not a solely French, but rather an international team, as it comprised also scholars of other nationalities, notably Greek and German. From finds to exhibits: the Museum of Delphi =The inauguration of the first Museum= On the 2nd of May 1903 the Great Excavation was accomplished triumphantly with the inauguration of the Delphi Archaeological Museum which was going to host the finds. The construction of the museum was enabled by a trust created by the Greek politician and benefactor Andreas Syngros. The inauguration of the museum was an event of international calibre as a number of highly acclaimed personalities in the field of culture and diplomacy were present. The museum was built on croquis designed by the French architect of the excavations Œë. Tournaire. The museographic approach of Th. Homolle, based on the use of cast copies of architectural members, in order to demonstrate the sculptures \\"in context\\", was soon judged outdated.Hellman, M.-C., Skorda, D. (et al.)(1992), La red√©couverte de Delphes, Paris =The second generation : 1903‚Äì1939= In the course of the next thirty years several prominent Greek and foreign archaeologists and researchers worked at Delphi: Keramopoullos, Meliadis and Romaeos, Van Effenterre, Jannoray, Georges Daux and the nobleman Pierre de La Coste-Messeli√®re counted among them. They proposed new identifications and a totally new perspective of the exhibition, which necessitated a remodeling of the museum. They finally started pressing for the creation of a new museum. =The second museum= This museum was inaugurated in 1939. The antiquities were placed according to a chronological order and the plaster casts were removed. This exhibition, however, was going to be a particularly difficult one: the outbreak of World War II led the authorities to have the antiquities buried or to transfer them to Athens. Among these antiquities were the ones discovered on that same year under the Sacred Way, within a dump which had been used in antiquity for burying precious sacred ex votos destroyed by fire or other causes; among these finds counted the chryselephantine statues, the silver bull, the bronze Pair of Athletes and the Incense burner in the form of Peplophoros. The Museum didn't open again until after 1950, because Delphi remained a military zone throughout the Greek Civil War. The third phase of the Museum By 1956 it was evident that the Museum needed an extension. The existing building was refurbished and enlarged by the architect Patroclos Karantinos. The new museographic approach was the result of the collaboration of the Ephore of Antiquities of Delphi Ioanna Konstantinou and of Christos Karouzos, director of the National Archaeological Museum. The new Delphi Museum opened its gates in 1961, at the time when the economic and cultural regeneration of Greece started bringing loads of foreign tourists to the site. The 21st century museum Finally, one century after the first inauguration of the museum a new exhibition took place, aiming at the enhancement of some of the exhibits, such as the Charioteer and the gold and ivory statues as well as at the compatibility of the museological approach with the new scholarly conclusions stemming from the ongoing study of the objects. As Rozina Kolonia, former Ephor of Antiquities of Delphi, notes in the guidebook of the Museum, the exhibits are displayed in a way that they ‚Äúcompose a historical novel, the pages of which run across twelve centuries of history and archaeology: they narrate through museography the political, religious and ¬¥artistic activity of the most renowned sanctuary of paganism and of its oracle.‚ÄùKolonia, R., 2006, The archaeological museum of Delphi\\", Athens Bibliography *Jacquemin, A.

Before its closure in 2012, the prison was marked by its changes in ownership and multiple cancelled contracts. Beginning in June 1995 the facility housed inmates from Missouri and Utah. The Missouri inmates rioted in February 1996, battering down a control door and setting fire to one section. No Utah inmates were involved in the rioting, but three had previously escaped from Crystal City, and another three from Frio.

He was the eldest surviving son of Herbert Whitfield (1560‚Äì1622), a landowner, and his wife Martha Sheppard (d.1613), second daughter of Robert Sheppard of Peasmarsh in Sussex and his wife Agnes Birchet from Rye. His great-grandfather Robert Whitfield (c.1453‚Äì1541), from Alston Moor in Cumberland, had settled at Wadhurst in Sussex and a great-uncle had built the historic house of Rowfant at Worth. Career Trained in law at Gray's Inn, where he was admitted on 3 February 1608, by 1621 Whitfield was acting as counsel for the Cinque Ports and in 1622 inherited his father's estate. As a landowner he was appointed to the Commission of Sewers (the drainage authority) for Kent and for Sussex. He also served on county commissions against piracy and recusancy. By 1625 he was a Justice of the Peace for Kent and for Sussex. In 1624 he was elected Member of Parliament for Clitheroe in Lancashire and had an active term, sitting on several committees and speaking on several issues, until he was replaced in 1625. In November 1632 he was appointed a Serjeant-at-law and by 1633 was permanent counsel to the Cinque Ports, being made a King's Serjeant in 1635. On 4 October 1635 he was knighted at Hampton Court Palace and appointed a judge of oyer and terminer and of gaol delivery for London and Middlesex. In addition to his judicial work in England, he was involved in colonial ventures overseas. In 1627 he was a founder member of the Guiana Company, set up by royal patent to trade with the Amazon basin and north coast of South America, while in 1638 he headed a royal commission on the plantation of The Honourable The Irish Society in County Londonderry on the north coast of Ireland. When the English Civil War broke out, he chose the Parliament side and was retained as a legal adviser to the House of Lords. Investing the considerable profits of his career in real estate, he acquired the manor of Burmarsh in Kent and lands at Wivenhoe in Essex as well as a house in the Barbican, London. In 1640 he also held the patronage of the parish of Rodmersham in Kent.

Life and career McGuire was born in Peterborough, South Australia on 3 April 1903. His father, James McGuire, was the Railways Commissioner. He attended Christian Brothers College, Adelaide and the University of Adelaide. At university he was the Tinline Scholar in History. Also as a university student he helped to organise Save the Children Australia raising money for famine relief targeted to Russian children following World War I. McGuire began story-writing with detective stories, some of which were published in the United Kingdom. Between 1932 and 1936, McGuire published ten novels, a book of verse and an essay on the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins. During World War II, McGuire was an officer of the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve. In May 1945, McGuire was demobilised from the Navy and took up a role as special European correspondent for The Argus newspaper. In the role he visited Ireland, France, the Scandinavian countries, Holland, Belgium and Germany; meeting Konrad von Preysing and Martin Niem√∂ller whilst in Germany. McGuire returned to Australia in January 1947, having also visited Canada and the United States on the way home. While in North America McGuire met personally then US President Harry S. Truman and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King. In 1949 McGuire's book There's Freedom for the Brave was published to favourable reviews, including in The New York Times and Life magazine. In April 1953, Minister for External Affairs Richard Casey, Baron Casey announced McGuire's appointment as Australian Ambassador to Ireland, saying that the Department of External Affairs was \\"inadequate in sufficiently senior and experienced career personnel to fill all the Australian posts abroad,\\" and that it was necessary to draw on experienced people from outside the department to fill some overseas posts. McGuire did not formally take up his post due to a dispute between the Australian and Irish governments about the style of his credentials. The Australian Government wanted for McGuire's title to be Ambassador to Southern Ireland, while the Irish Government wanted his title to be Ambassador to the President of the Republic of Ireland. No agreement was secured between the two governments. In March 1954, Casey announced McGuire's appointment as Minister to Italy. McGuire died on 15 June 1978 in North Adelaide, South Australia.

He is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, the American College of Epidemiologyand the Royal Statistical Society of Great Britain. His doctoral thesis was the basis for the Zippin Estimator, a procedure for estimating wildlife populations using data from trapping experiments. He was a principal investigator in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) which assesses the magnitude and nature of the cancer problem in the United States. In 1961, he created training programs for cancer registry personnel, which he conducted nationally and internationally. He carried out research on the epidemiology and rules for staging of various cancers. He received a Lifetime Achievement and Leadership Award from the NCI in 2003. Early life and education Zippin was born on July 17, 1926 in Albany, New York, United States, the son of Samuel and Jennie (Perkel) Zippin. He received an AB degree magna cum laude in biology and mathematics, from the State University of New York at Albany in 1947. He was a Research Assistant at the Sterling-Winthrop Research Institute in Rensselaer, New York beginning in 1947. He was awarded a Doctor of Science degree in Biostatistics by the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland in 1953. His thesis advisor was William G. Cochran a statistician known for Cochran‚Äôs theorem, Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel Test and author of standard biostatistical texts: ‚ÄúExperimental Designs‚Äù and ‚ÄúSampling Techniques‚Äù. Zippin‚Äôs doctoral thesis, An Evaluation of the Removal Method of Estimating Animal Populations became the basis for the Zippin Estimator, and has been used for estimating populations of a wide variety of animal species. It is considered among the easiest and most accurate methods for estimating animal populations in the wild. Career At the Sterling-Winthrop Research Institute, Zippin performed various laboratory and statistical duties under Lloyd C. Miller, Ph.D., later Director of Revision (1950-1970) of the United States Pharmacopoeia. Dr. Miller encouraged Zippin to pursue a career in statistics which led to his graduate work at Johns Hopkins where he also held an appointment as a Research Assistant in Statistics from 1950 to 1953. Following graduate school, Zippin became an Instructor in Biostatistics (1953-1955) at the School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley. He moved to the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco where, at the level of assistant professor, he held appointments in the Cancer Research Institute and the Department of Preventive Medicine. With further advancement, in 1967 he became Professor of Epidemiology in the Cancer Research Institute, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Department of Pathology. Since 1991 he has been Professor Emeritus. Zippin was a Visiting Associate Professor of Statistics, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA (1962); National Institutes of Health (NIH) Special Postdoctoral Fellow, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (1964-1965); Visiting Research Worker, Middlesex Hospital Medical School, London (1975); Research Advisor, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Zerifin, Israel (1976-2010); Faculty Advisor, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala State, India (1984-1991). Research Zippin‚Äôs doctoral thesis became the basis for the Zippin Estimator, a mathematical procedure for estimating wildlife population size based on capture and removal of sequentially trapped animal samples. The method was explored by P. A. P. Moran (1951) and its properties elaborated by Zippin in 1956 and 1958. Zippin has done extensive research on cancer staging, particularly cancer of the breastand colon-rectum with the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union Against Cancer. He has published on the epidemiology of breast, uterine, and nasopharyngeal cancer, late effects of radiation, and survival patterns in acute lymphocytic and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. His 1960 and 1966 JNCI breast cancer staging articles were included in the \\"Yearbook of Cancer\\" compendium of the most influential cancer publications for those years, respectively. Zippin collaborated with Peter Armitage, extending a mathematical model assuming survival time of cancer patients to follow an exponential distribution whose key parameter (expected survival time) is linearly related to a measure of the severity (e.g., white blood count in leukemia) of disease. The extension provided for the common situation where some patients were still alive and their limited (censored) survival information could be used in estimating the value of the desired parameter. From 1973 to 1995, Zippin collaborated with Dr. Yoav Horn comparing characteristics of Arab cancer patients living on the West Bank, their disease and survival with those of patients in Israel and the United States. This project documented the need for improved treatment facilities and the training of oncologists in that region. Horn, an Israeli oncologist, started two cancer clinics in Nablus and Beit Jala and developed a training program for Arab oncologists for which Dr. Horn received the Sasakawa Health Prize from the World Health Organization in 2000. Honors and awards Zippin is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association (1980), American College of Epidemiology (1982), and the Royal Statistical Society of Great Britain (1965). He was President of the Western North American Region of the International Biometric Society (1979-1980) and a member of the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (1979-1981). He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, Delta Omega (honorary public health society), and Signum Laudis (honorary academic society).

The ancestors of the Nekton family died trying to solve the riddle of how to get to the lost city of Lemuria and refused to abandon it. Now, thanks to family friend Nereus, the Nektons know why they are so attracted to solving underwater riddles; because they are the descendants of Lemurians.

The paradox highlights the fact that a person can simultaneously advocate two conflicting policy options A and B, provided that the person believes that democratic decisions should be followed. The paradox was formulated by the British philosopher Richard Wollheim in 1962 in an article entitled \\"A paradox in the theory of democracy\\".In \\"Philosophy, Politics and Society\\", edited by Peter Laslett and W.G. Runciman, published by Basil Blackwell, 1962. Pp. 71-87.  Summary  In his article, Wollheim describes a machine that compiles the votes of voters in such a way that the result invariably is the most democratic outcome. He also assumes that a voting person has preferences that enable them to prefer policy proposal A to B, and that the proposals are mutually exclusive. The person believes that Proposal A should be realized, and moreover that he should vote on the proposals he believes should be implemented. So he gives his vote to option A in the machine. Once the machine has tallied all votes, proposal B has received more votes than option A. Since the person is democratically minded, he believes now that the proposal that the democratic process has chosen should be realized, in this case B. So the person believes that both proposals A and B should be implemented, which is a contradiction.  Analysis  Wollheim presents in his essay two ways to resolve the paradox, which he rejects. The first strategy is based on the idea that the person does not really prefer A, but his preference should really be formulated as \\"A, if the majority vote for it\\". Wollheim rejects this formulation because it is about what result the machine gives, and not about what the person himself thinks of the two proposals. There is no distinction between \\"A, if enough people vote as\\" and \\"B, if enough people vote so\\". These preferences are equivalent to \\"what result the machine gives\\" meaning that the person concerned gives its consent to the democratic machine itself. But the machine's function assumes that it can compile the voters' preferences on different policy options. The machine cannot work without voters having preferences, yet the voters prefer the result of the machine over their own preferences. The other solution that Wollheim rejects is that the person doesn't really prefer B, but rather consider it wise or tactically smart to accept the machine's result. The preference for B is of a different type from the moral-based preference for A, which means that the paradox is dissolved. The problem with this solution is that, while perhaps some people accept the machine's result because they think it is wise or tactically smart to do so, there are probably at least a few people who believe that there are moral reasons to accept the democratic decision of the machine. For these people, the paradox remains, and must be solved in a different way. Wollheim sketches an analysis in which the paradox may not arise. He postulates two principles of moral values, \\"direct\\" and \\"oblique\\": > \\"Direct principles to the morality of actions, policies, motives, etc., > where these are picked out or designated by means of some general > descriptive expressions, e.g., murder, envy, benevolence, birth control, > telling lies, etc. Oblique principles, by contrast, refer to the morality of > actions, policies, motives, etc., where these actions, policies, motives, > etc., are not picked out by reference to some common quality of > characteristic that they possess, but are identified by means of an > artificial property bestowed on them either as the result of an act of will > of some individual or in consequence of the corporate actions of some > institution. Now, my suggestion is that two judgements of the form 'A ought > to be the case' and 'B ought to be the case' are not incompatible even > though A and B cannot be simultaneously realized if one of these judgements > is asserted as a direct principle whereas the other is asserted as a > derivation from an oblique principle-provided that the direct and oblique > principle are not themselves incompatible\\".Weiss, Donald D.: \\"Wollheim's > Paradox: Survey and Solution\\".

The extreme weather events of 535‚Äì536 were the early phenomena of the century-long global temperature decline. One study suggested a global cooling of . Description The existence of a cooling period was proposed as a theory in 2015, and subsequently confirmed as the interval from 536 to about 660 CE. This period coincides with two to three immense volcanic eruptions in 525/536, 539/540 and 547. The 536 eruption is surmised to have been from a high-latitude volcano, such as in Alaska or Iceland. However, the 535 eruption of Krakatoa is also a suggested candidate. The extreme weather events of 535‚Äì536 were the early phenomena of the century- long global temperature decline. One study suggested a global cooling of . The 539/540 volcano is believed to have been Ilopango in present-day El Salvador. Another suspected volcanic site is the Rabaul caldera in the western Pacific, which erupted around 540. The evidence comes from a temperature reconstruction from the Euro-Med2k working group of the international PAGES (Past Global Changes) project, using new tree-ring measurements from the Altai Mountains, which closely matches the temperatures in the Alps in the last two centuries. Additional ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica show increases in sulfate, a product of volcanic eruptions, at 536 and 539/540. Regional impacts =Mesoamerica= It is theorized that the eruption of Ilopango and subsequent weather events and agricultural failures directly led to the abandonment of Teotihuacan by the original inhabitants. =Middle East= According to research by a team from the Swiss Federal Research Institute at Birmensdorf, the fall in temperatures led to the Arabian peninsula experiencing a dramatic increase in fertility. The boost of food supply contributed to the Arab expansion beyond the Arabian peninsula in the Islamic conquests. The cool period also led to increased strain on the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sassanid Persian Empire, hence easing the Muslim conquest of the Levant, the Muslim conquest of Egypt and the Muslim conquest of Persia. According to research done by Israeli scientists, starting in 540, the size of the population of the city of Elusa in the Negev desert and the amount of garbage it generated shrank greatly. Elusa housed tens of thousands of people during its height. The major decline took place around the middle of the sixth century, about a century before the Islamic conquest. One possible explanation for the crisis was the Late Antique Little Ice Age. =Mediterranean region= The cooling period coincided with the Plague of Justinian, that began in 541, though the connection between the plague and the volcanoes still remains tenuous. The cooling period contributed to the migrations of the Lombards and Slavs into Roman territory in Italy and the Balkans.

He flew over Europe, Asia, and North America, making a total of 122 distinct flights in his autogyro.  Global triathlon challenge  On 1 February 2014, Ketchell became the first person to complete the triathlon of rowing across the Atlantic Ocean, summiting Mount Everest and cycling around the world. In 2010, Ketchell rowed single-handed across the Atlantic Ocean in 110 days, four hours and four minutes from La Gomera to Antigua. On 16 May 2011 Ketchell reached the summit of Mount Everest. Upon his descent he succumbed to pneumonia and spent a week in hospital after arriving back into the UK. On 30 June 2013 Ketchell departed Greenwich Park and embarked on an 18,000 mile unsupported global cycle, through 20 countries and cycling on average 100 miles a day.  Indian Ocean 2015  Ketchell attempted to row 3,600 miles across the Indian Ocean from Geraldton to Mauritius in 2015 with fellow Scouting Ambassador, Ashley Wilson. Their aim was to raise awareness of epilepsy among young people as well as supporting other charities (including Young Epilepsy and The Scouts.) The expedition ended 200 miles off the coast of Western Australia when Ketchell‚Äôs rowing partner sustained a serious head injury during a storm and needed to be rescued. A 100,000 ton crude oil tanker called the Dubai Charm came to their rescue.

They were established in Styal by the Chorlton Poor Law Union Board of Guardians who financed the project with a loan of ¬£50,000 from Liverpool Corporation. The foundation stone for the homes was laid on 31 August 1896, by Arthur Balfour, who was then MP for East Manchester. The architect was JB Broadbent of Manchester. There were 12 homes, each with 20 beds, and four smaller homes with 10 beds each. More buildings were added in 1905 and in 1928. In 1948 long stay accommodation for 438 children was provided. The children were required to wear uniforms. The establishment was 22 housemothers, 12 assistant housemothers and 18 relief housemothers. Pay for a housemother was ¬£4/2/- for a 48-hour week. ¬£1/3/- was deducted for board and lodging. 20 children ran away in one month. There was a farm training school. A 16 horsepower Austin vehicle was provided by the City Council in 1948 to enable sports teams to get to away fixtures. There was a military band, but it was closed in 1948 at the same time that corporal punishment was abolished. However this was not always the case as it was not unusual for children to be punished if caught talking at night once the lights were off. A slipper was used for this. If children wet their bed they would have to take their sheets to the laundry and wash them by hand, and therefore not attend school. In 1951 it was agreed that the number of children accommodated would be reduced and that cottages should have both boys and girls. Children were to attend outside schools and they were allowed bicycles. In 1952, as the process of running down the homes progressed the school, farm and bakery closed. 82 children ran away in May. The City Council developed a programme for building family group homes as an alternative. The last child left in 1956. By that time Manchester had opened 22 family group homes, housing 116 children.

Located on the north side of Vermont Route 9 east of the town center, its production peaked in the 1830s, and was afterward converted into a gentleman's farm. Surviving elements of its past include the remains of iron smelting furnaces (some of only few in the state), housing, and agricultural outbuildings. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history Furnace Grove stands on the rural eastern outskirts of Bennington, on the north side of Vermont Route 9. The property includes sandwiched between a branch of the Walloomsac River to the south and the Green Mountains to the north, and includes three surviving residential structures, a number of agricultural outbuildings, and the industrial remains of its iron foundry past. Few alterations have been made to the landscape since the early 20th century. One of the oldest surviving buildings is a c. 1805 building, originally used as the foundry's company store, and now a private residence. The prominent houses of the complex are the Leake House, a Queen Anne/Colonial Revival building whose oldest parts date to 1830, and the Leavenworth House, a brick 1-1/2 story Federal period house, also with later alterations. Structural ruins of two of the foundry's furnaces survive; a third was broken down, and its stone used to build the gates at the entrance to the area. Also surviving are the remains of a canal and holding pond that provided water to the facility, and a portion of the Bennington and Glastenbury Railroad right- of-way. The iron furnace was established here in 1805, by owners of another nearby furnace whose ore sources were played out. The success of this location was such that the town of Bennington was forced to improve its roads to the area, and at its peak the operators employed 150-200 workers. At its 1831 peak, the two active blast furnaces produced 7 tons of pig iron daily, and also had a smaller cupola furnace capable of further refining pig iron into a product suitable for producing utilitarian iron products, such as cauldrons, fireboxes, cooking stoves, plow points, and machinery parts. The furnace closed in 1842, unable to compete with larger and more advantageously placed businesses, and hampered by issues with its ore sources. In the second half of the 19th century, the property was transformed into a summer country retreat.

The school participated in boxing, football, table tennis, cross country, and cricket competitions. In 1953 Alexander was elected President of the Association of Headmasters, Headmistresses, and Matrons of Approved Schools. In 1959 the Home Office requested an increase in numbers from 104 to 120.

It is an (Gospel motet), based on the gospel in German of the temptation of Christ, written for one of the Sundays of Lent. The text is the biblical passage from the Gospel of Matthew (), followed by the first stanza from the hymn \\"\\" written by Georg Weissel, in a setting of the original melody by Johann Stob√§us. The duration is given as 4 minutes. It was published by Carus-Verlag in 1968. A characteristic feature of the composition is that the part of the devil is rendered spoken, at times in canon.  Series of motets  Gunsenheimer composed a sequence of five motets for Sundays in Lent: # ', on the story of Jesus and two disciples (1966) # ' (1968) # ', on the raising of Jairus' daughter (1969) # ', on healing the blind near Jericho (1970) # ', on Jesus and the Canaanite woman (1971) He added a motet for a Sunday after Easter: ', on the story of the doubting Thomas (1972)  Composition  The structure of the piece follows the biblical narration of the devil leading Jesus into the desert and tempting him three times. The composition is in F-sharp minor in free meter, changing at times without indication from the general 4/4 to 5/4 for reasons of text declamation. No tempo marking is given at the beginning, but relative markings such as \\"breiter\\" (broader) appear occasionally. For most of the piece, the sopranos are divided, occasionally also the men's voices to three parts, however never six different parts at the same time. The composer assigns the part of the narrator to a choir from two to five voices, illustrating different aspects of the text. The part of the devil is spoken, in precise notation of rhythm and dynamic, the second temptation ending with a three-part spoken canon, the third temptation ending with a four-part spoken canon which ends in whispering. The part of Jesus is assigned to the choir singing always in homophony in the manner of recitative, from two to five parts. The part rendering the gospel text ends in D major, the key for the closing chorale in a four-part setting. ' was recorded by the Dresdner Kreuzchor, conducted by Roderich Kreile, in 1998.

It provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables userspace utility (before v0.6.0 iptables backend), acting as an alternative to the nft command line program. The name firewalld adheres to the Unix convention of naming system daemons by appending the letter \\"d\\". firewalld is written in Python. It was intended to be ported to C++, but the porting project was abandoned in January 2015. Features firewalld supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles. Administrators can configure Network Manager to automatically switch zone profiles based on known Wi-Fi (wireless) and Ethernet (wired) networks, but firewalld cannot do this on its own. Services and applications can use the D-Bus interface to query and configure the firewall. firewalld supports timed rules, meaning the number of connections (or \\"hits\\") to a service can be limited globally. There is no support for hit-counting and subsequent connection rejection per source IP; a common technique deployed to limit the impact of brute-force hacking and distributed denial-of-service attacks. firewalld's command syntax is similar to but more verbose than other iptables front-ends like Ubuntu's Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw). The command-line interface allows managing firewall rulesets for protocol, ports, source and destination; or predefined services by name. Services are defined as XML files containing port- and protocol-mappings, and optionally extra information like specifying subnets and listing required Kernel helper modules. The syntax resembles that of systemd's service files. A simple service file for a web server listening on TCP port 443 might look like this: Web Server Public web host over HTTPS. Limitations: Firewalld currently does not support outbound rules to the same capacity of inbound rules. Limitations include things such on ipsets, service names, and default outbound block by default rules required by standards such as NIST 800-171 and 800-53. Default block all needs to be done at the \\"raw\\" IPTables level via the direct flag, and with the order of operations FirewallD uses to prioritize Rrules, rich rules, direct rules, it may be easier to enter all rules for outbound via direct or use iptables (netfilter-persist) Graphical front-ends (GUIs) firewall-config is a graphical front-end that is optionally included with firewalld, with support for most of its features. firewall-applet is a small status indicator utility that is optionally included with firewalld. It can provide firewall event log notifications as well as a quick way to open firewall-config. firewall-applet was ported from the GTK+ to the Qt framework in the summer of 2015 following the GNOME Desktop‚Äôs deprecation of system tray icons. Adoption firewalld ships by default on the following Linux distributions: * CentOS 7 and newer * Fedora 18 and newer * OpenSUSE Leap 15 and newerhttps://en.opensuse.org/Firewalld * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and newer * SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 and newer firewalld is enabled by default in all of these distributions. firewalld is also available as one of many firewall options in the package repository of many other popular distributions such as Debian or Ubuntu.

It was conceived in July 1914 by the Automobile Club of Savannah, which envisioned a practical all-year driving route from Georgia to California. It was originally developed as a cross-country route, from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean making history as the first ever ocean to ocean highway route. In 1925, the federal Joint Board on Interstate Highways created U.S. Route 80, largely following the route of the Dixie Overland Highway. History Established in 1914 by the Automobile Club of Savannah, the Dixie Overland Highway auto trail was the first major route connecting San Diego, California, and Savannah, Georgia. In July 1914, the Automobile Club of Savannah, Georgia, made a path-finding tour across the state of Georgia to Columbus. They found a practical route, constructed road made up about one- half of the route. A meeting was held in Columbus. It was determined to secure the construction of the entire highway. The cross Georgia highway continued to stretch the idea suggested by the pioneers, and a sea-to-sea highway. An association was formed, officers were elected, and a plan of operation agreed voted upon. Construction was promoted and the use of the highway would be through the states of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. After investigating and researching where the most efficient points of interest would be in order to determine the location of the highway, a practical route was found, connecting the cities of Savannah, Columbus, Montgomery, Selma, Meridian, Jackson, Vicksburg, Shreveport, Dallas, Fort Worth, Alamogordo, El Paso, Lordsburg, Douglas, Phoenix, Yuma, San Diego, and Los Angeles, which were almost guaranteed to never be snowbound, and provide all-year road access. It was then developed that the Dixie Overland Highway when constructed would be the shortest, straightest, and only year-round, ocean-to-ocean highway, in the United States. All highways east of the Mississippi and the most of those west of the river, were laid out for north and south travel. Making history as one of the most useful and historically important highways in the south. Especially valuable for military purposes due to the short distance freight. The first meeting of the Dixie Overland Highway Association was held in Columbus on July 17, 1914, to celebrate the arrival of the pathfinders from Savannah. An organization was appointed. The following year, on July 24, the association met in Savannah for its second meeting. It received reports that the highway project was then about 50 percent constructed. The members then formed a permanent organization. On February 14, 1917, the Dixie Overland Highway Association was incorporated in the state of Georgia for a 20-year period as a nonprofit organization, Its purposes are to foster the construction and use of a highway from Savannah, Georgia, to Los Angeles, California, through eight states, seventy-four counties and nearly two hundred towns and villages; to strive for uniform, wise and equitable road legislation in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California; to aid in bringing about efficient road administration; to seek continuous and systematic maintenance of all roads and their classification according to traffic requirements; to promote cooperation in 'units' or 'locals' on the parts of towns, cities, communities, precincts and other political subdivisions; to mark the highway; to give publicity to its historical character, by monuments, guide-books, bulletins and other printed matter; to affiliate and cooperate with other good roads associations. The Dixie Overland Highway Association debated on a definitive western end point for the Dixie Overland Highway in southern California. California politicians Stanley Hufflund and Ed Fletcher convinced the association in an August 1918 meeting to choose San Diego over Los Angeles. In May 1919, the Executive Committee of the Dixie Overland Highway Association approved San Diego as the western terminus and elected Colonel Ed Fletcher to be president of the association. Colonel Ed Fletcher 200px Colonel Ed Fletcher began his San Diego career as a produce merchant, but branched out into water and land development. He and other San Diego boosters recognized that one of the main obstacles to its development was Los Angeles. Early in the century, Los Angeles, unlike San Diego, had a direct rail link to the east. In his self- published 1952 book Memoirs of Ed Fletcher, he described the celebration of the construction of the Dixie Overland Highway as a \\"gala occasion.\\" Fletcher reprinted a tribute written two decades later called \\"A crystallized Hope\\" in the tribute it was stated that, \\"Newspapers in the southwest corner of America tell of another remarkable achievement‚Äîthe completion of a national highway between San Diego and Phoenix with only unpaved between El Paso and San Diego. Twenty years ago this thing was projected as a dream of a super-realtor in San Diego, Ed Fletcher, and in the mind and heart of Governor Hunt, of Arizona. When the thing was started the projectors had to go by rail by way of Los Angeles in order to get to Yuma.\\" In December 1911, 84 delegates from Arizona, California, and New Mexico met in Phoenix, Arizona, to form the Ocean-to-Ocean Transcontinental Highway Association. The goal was to select a route and promote construction of a highway across the country. Colonel Fletcher continued promoting a transcontinental route for San Diego. In 1912, he joined with other prominent San Diego citizens who raised $3,000 (equivalent to $ in ) as prize money and challenged Los Angeles interests to a race to Phoenix. Residents of Phoenix added $1,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in prize money. The competition began with a pathfinder race. Fletcher drove San Diego's entry, a Franklin provided by the Tribune-Gazette, from San Diego by way of El Centro, a distance of . He arrived in Phoenix after a trip of 19 hours. The Los Angeles entry traveled by way of Blythe, a distance of about ‚Äîor would have if the car had not broken down in the desert. The vehicle never reached Phoenix. The race had been part of a series of races that began in 1908, when the Automobile Club of Southern California conceived the idea as a way of promoting the Good Roads Movement. There were raised many concerns about building the road from San Diego to Georgia, such as the sand dunes and desert territory that would need to be crossed, Fletcher continued to stay an activist and fight for the road to be built in San Diego. After years of fighting, Fletcher convinced the association in an August 1918 meeting to choose San Diego over Los Angeles. In May 1919, the Executive Committee of the Dixie Overland Highway Association approved San Diego as the western terminus, and elected Fletcher to be president of the association. U.S. Route 80 today Historic Route sign seen on California US 80 Although The Dixie Overland Highway may contemporaneously be known as U.S. Route 80 (US 80), it was still the first road to reach the goal of developing an ocean-to-ocean highway system. The United States Numbered Highway System was created in November 1926, turning the Dixie Overland Highway into US 80\\\\. The only parts of the DOH that were not incorporated into US 80 were three sections in Georgia, two short sections in Alabama, and one across western Texas. US 80 today runs . The entire segment west of Dallas, Texas, has been decommissioned in favor of various Interstate Highways and state highways. Currently, the highway's western terminus is at an interchange with Interstate 30 (I-30) on the Dallas‚ÄìMesquite, Texas city line. The highway's eastern terminus is in Tybee Island, Georgia near the interchange of I-516 and US 17 in Savannah, at the intersection of State Route 26, Butler Avenue, Inlet Avenue, and Tybrisa Street, near the Atlantic Ocean. Between Jonesville, Texas, and Kewanee, Mississippi, US 80 runs parallel to or concurrently with I-20. US 80 also currently runs through Dallas, Texas; Shreveport, Louisiana; Jackson, Mississippi; Montgomery, Alabama; Columbus, Georgia; Macon, Georgia; and Savannah, Georgia. Throughout the 1950s, US 80 grew to become a popular highway that often competed with US 66\\\\. At one point, more cars were recorded entering California on US 80 than on US 66\\\\. Like US 66, US 80 would grow to become a keystone highway in shaping American car culture. This period of renaissance would be short lived, with the creation of the Interstate and Defense Highway System in 1957. Four Interstates were slated to replace US 80 as a major highway; Interstate 8 between San Diego and Yuma, Arizona, Interstate 10 between Tucson and Pecos, Texas, Interstate 20 between Pecos and Meridian, Mississippi and Interstate 16 between Macon, Georgia and Savannah. Between 1964 and 1991, US 80 was slowly removed in increments between Dallas and San Diego. US 80 was seen as obsolete to the western states, which favored the new Interstate highways in its place. As such, US 80 is no longer an active U.S. Highway in California, Arizona, New Mexico and western Texas. Today, I-8, I-10 and I-20 have largely replaced US 80 between Dallas and San Diego. Notable surviving sections of old US 80 include the entirety of both New Mexico State Road 80 and Arizona State Route 80, and all of County Route S80 in Imperial County, California. Other former sections of US 80, particularly in California and parts of Arizona, carry the title Old Highway 80 or similar variations of that name. Multiple efforts are working to designate whole sections of US 80 as a historic route. California became the first state to recognize Historic U.S. Route 80 in 2007. As of 2018, the states of California, Arizona and Louisiana recognize former and current sections of US 80 as a historic route.

It features a team-up between the main protagonist of Kamen Rider and the cast of Kamen Rider Ghost. Plot Tokyo is under attack by the evil Shocker organization, which is intent on capturing a girl named Mayu Tachibana. However, their plans are thwarted by , a splinter group bent on conquering the global economy instead of just world domination. Takeru Tenk≈´ji arrives on the scene and helps Mayu escape, but is overwhelmed by the Nova Shocker general Wolga before Takeshi Hongo appears and dispatches the Shocker Combatmen. Back at Daitenk≈´-ji, Takeru, Akari Tsukimura, and Onari learn of the history of Shocker, and Akari deduces that Mayu is from J≈çnan University Affiliated High School based on her school uniform during the attack. To know more about Mayu, Takeru and Akari go undercover at the university as teachers. One day after school, Akari and Mayu are attacked by Shocker when Hongo once again intervenes and transforms into Kamen Rider 1. Following a brief reunion, Mayu slaps Hongo and runs away. After a brief conversation with Takeru, Akari, Onari, and Makoto Fukami, Hongo goes to Mayu's class the next day to lecture about the value of life. After school, Hongo and Mayu have a conversation, where Mayu is revealed to be the granddaughter of Hongo's longtime friend Tobei Tachibana and she had held a grudge on Hongo for not looking after her for the past three years. The two mend their relationship as uncle and niece, despite Hongo's financial burden. Meanwhile, Nova Shocker fires an electromagnetic pulse that causes a blackout and mass panic throughout the country while Shocker reveals that they need Mayu as a sacrificial lamb for their great leader, Ambassador Hell. Takeru and Makoto rush to the park to ask Hongo for his help in solving the blackout anomaly, but Mayu convinces Hongo to keep his promise to never fight again. Kamen Rider Ghost and Kamen Rider Specter arrive at Nova Shocker's headquarters, but are once again overwhelmed by the generals Wolga, Eagla, and Buffal. The next morning, Nova Shocker force the Prime Minister to sign a contract that binds the Japanese government with their organization in exchange for the restoration of electricity with their Nova Energy, only to cause mass power outages and pollution. Takeru, Akari, and Onari find Hongo by a log cabin to once again ask for his help, but Hongo has them do primitive chores instead. Hongo suddenly collapses, as years of fighting Shocker have taken their toll on his body. Mayu realizes that he did not abandon her, but traveled the world to protect it from Shocker. The cabin is attacked by Shocker, led by a revived Ambassador Hell. Hongo fends off against the Combatmen, but his body gives out as Ambassador Hell captures Mayu and prepares her for the sacrificial ritual. Ambassador Hell reveals that he was given the Eyecon of Alexander the Great and placed it in Mayu's body for it to mature so he may wield its power. The ceremony is disrupted by Nova Shocker, ensuing a three-way battle between the Shocker groups and the Kamen Riders. The Alexander Eyecon is released from Mayu's body, but is captured by Wolga. Hongo saves Mayu, but is mortally wounded by a shockwave emitted by Wolga's new power. His body is cremated that night while Kamen Rider Ghost and Kamen Rider Specter battle Nova Shocker before a possessed Wolga slays Eagla. Hearing the cries of his niece, Hongo suddenly emerges from his fiery grave and goes to an old barn to pick up his Neo Cyclone. Takeru and Makoto, along with Ambassador Hell, are outmatched by Wolga and Buffal when Hongo suddenly rushes in to even the odds. With the help of Kamen Rider 1, Kamen Rider Ghost kills Buffal. Wolga mortally wounds Ambassador Hell, but the three Kamen Riders finish him off with their Rider Kicks. With his dying breath, Ambassador Hell destroys the Alexander Eyecon as Hongo rides off into the sunset. Hongo returns by the cliffs to tell Takeru, Akari, Onari, and Mayu that he must once again leave Japan to continue his fight. Takeru tells him that he will always be his hero.

The record was released on December 31, 2007 via iDeal Recordings label. Background This is an eponymous album as he used one of his stage names, Aleph-1. The concept of the album and its name, Aleph-1, derive from the theories of German mathematician Georg Cantor, who was a teacher in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, a city, to which Alva Noto is deeply connected with through his family. In mathematical terms, \\\\aleph_1 is the cardinality of the set of all countable ordinal numbers or a number of elements in endless successions. Reception A reviewer of Boomkat stated \\"Always cause for no small amount of excitement, a new release from Carsten Nicolai tends to be a pretty significant event for the electronic music community. As suggested by the new moniker, the Aleph-1 project marks a departure from some of the more familiar Alva Noto approaches to composition, although these recordings do tie in to some extent with the rhythmic minimalism plotted out by Nicolai's older work, marking a step back from the more harmonic Xerrox material from last year. The most immediately striking aspect of this music is the presence of a pronounced melodic element, something that's previously barely featured in Nicolai's solo recordings. This manifests itself by replacing the abrupt prickling static soundset of the Transrapid/Transspray/Transvision triptych with more resonant, rounded tones, with simple, sustaining waves evolving gradually over the course of each piece within a network of looping, modulating phrases. This being Carsten Nicolai, the use of melody never makes itself too explicit, instead relying on a mesmeric, cumulative effect for its power. There's a subtlety and precision at work throughout Aleph-1, and after spending some time with these pieces you'll find yourself thoroughly absorbed by their awkward, immense beauty\\".

Adding to the confusion is the description in Portuguese sources that Tam√£o was an island. As Tuen Mun is not an island, researchers have proposed that Tam√£o may actually refer to one of the nearby islands. Nei Lingding Island has been identified by J. M. Braga to be the Tam√£o of the Portuguese sources, and is widely followed by Western scholarship; however, recent Chinese scholarship has argued that this identification is insufficiently supported by historical evidence, and suggests a number of other potential islands, such as the nearby, but larger, Lantau Island.

Description The remains of the Treasury of the Cnidians are situated just next to the Sacred Way close to the Siphnian Treasury to which they bear resemblance, to the exception of the smaller size. It was a marble building, erected before Cnidus was conquered by the Persians in 544 B.C. Its features remind of the mid-sixth century B.C. The treasury was built in the Ionian order, prostyle, but there is not much information on the exact plan of its elevation and the roof. It is possible that there were korae (Caryatids) on the fa√ßade instead of plain columns. At the time of the Great Excavation it was thought that the friezes and sculpted decoration of the Siphnian Treasury actually originated from the Treasury of the Knidians, a misinterpretation which led archaeologists to overestimate its artistic and aesthetic value. PausaniasPausanias, 10.11.5 described the monument but was puzzled by its architrave inscription: what he failed to notice was that it was written \\"boustrophedon\\", i.e. from left to right and from right to left. The inscription bears a dedication of the building to the Pythian Apollo. Apart from the main inscription, its walls and antae bear about sixty more inscriptions,Salviat, Fr.,1971, Inscriptions de Gr√®ce centrale, Paris, pp. 35‚Äì61 mostly honorary decrees and manumission acts, as well as two decrees of a fiscal character, quite enlightening on the finances of the time. Cnidus dedicated not only this treasury but also the renowned Lesche (club), decorated with paintings by the famous ancient painter Polygnotus, yet at a much later date.

Pineda Villa and her husband, Jos√© Luis Abarca Vel√°zquez were accused by Attorney General of Mexico Jes√∫s Murillo Karam, of being the \\"probable masterminds\\" behind the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping and disappearance of 43 students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College. Pineda Villa and her husband fled hours after the reported abductions and were arrested by federal authorities on November 4, 2014. The prosecution's investigation indicates that Mayor Abarca ordered local police to stop the students from protesting a political event and speech Pineda Villa was scheduled to hold. The police allegedly attacked the students' buses when they entered Iguala and then delivered them to members of the local drug gang, Guerreros Unidos. Along with her familial ties to the Sinaloa Cartel and Beltr√°n-Leyva Cartel, confessions by detained gang members and police officers have revealed Pineda Villa as the \\"principle operator\\" of the Guerreros Unidos.  Family and early ties to organized crime  Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles Pineda Villa is the daughter of Salom√≥n Pineda Berm√∫dez and Maria Leticia Villa Ortu√±o. She has four brothers: Julio Guadalupe, Mario Antonio, Salom√≥n and Alberto. Salom√≥n, or \\"El Malon\\" and his brothers, Mario \\"El MP\\" and Alberto \\"El Borrado\\", have operated as drug traffickers in Guerrero and Morelos since 2002. After operating independently as drug dealers in Guerrero, the brothers formally joined the Sinaloa Cartel in 2002. Under the orders of Arturo Beltr√°n Leyva, they were placed in charge of operations in Zihuatanejo and other areas of Guerrero, as well as the state of Morelos. The Pinedas trafficked drugs, primarily cocaine, coming from Colombia and Venezuela to Guerrero. In 2005, under the instruction of the Sinaloa Cartel, the brothers formed a group of 200 hitmen called the \\"Los Pelones\\" to control Guerrero and defend against attacks by rival cartels, such as the Los Zetas and La Familia Michoacana. The \\"Los Pelones\\" are believed to be the predecessor of the Guerreros Unidos. In 2006, the Mexican Drug War began under President Felipe Calder√≥n's administration, which involved a crackdown on drug trafficking organizations by Mexican authorities. In March 2009, Mexico's Office of the General Prosecutor (Procuradur√≠a General de la Rep√∫blica, PGR) named Alberto and Mario Antonio Pineda Villa in their list of the most wanted drug traffickers. In May 2009, five members of the Pineda Villa family were arrested by the PGR in Morelos: Alberto, Mario, Salom√≥n and their parents, Salom√≥n and Maria. In September 2009, Alberto and Mario were murdered for their betrayal of Arturo Beltr√°n Leyva. In December 2009, kingpin Arturo Beltr√°n Leyva was killed during a shootout with Mexican Marines in Cuernavaca, Morelos. His death caused the Beltr√°n-Leyva Cartel to break up into smaller independent organizations, led by former Betr√°n Leyva operators. This included the Guerreros Unidos, led by Salom√≥n \\"El Malon\\" Pineda Villa, in the Guerrero and Morelos states.  Political history  Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles Pineda and her husband, Jos√© Luis Abarca Vel√°zquez, met in Guerrero and built their wealth selling gold and jewelry. After accumulating a number of local businesses, they came into contact with local political bigwigs in Iguala who then tapped Abarca to enter a mayoral contest. Despite having no previous political experience, the businessman won the election and became Mayor of Iguala in June 2012. Mayor Abarca and Guerrero's Governor, √Ångel Aguirre, were both members of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) in opposition to President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). In 2013, Abarca was accused of killing a local community organizer and fellow PRD member, Arturo Hern√°ndez Cardona, and two fellow leftist activists the day after an argument at a city council meeting. Hern√°ndez's wife, Iguala city councilwoman Sofia Mendoza, gave a statement to state authorities, but they failed to investigate the allegations against Abarca. Evidence suggests that state officials, namely Governor √Ångel Aguirre of Guerrero, were aware of Mayor Abarca and Maria Pineda's criminal ties. On October 13, 2014, a video was posted online of a blindfolded and tied woman who identified herself as Maria Leonor Villa Ortu√±a, the mother of Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles Pineda and mother-in-law of Mayor Abarca. Along with detailing her family's criminal history and ties to the Beltr√°n-Leyva cartel, the woman claims that her sons funded √Ångel Aguirre's 2011 campaign for governor on behalf of the Beltr√°n- Leyva cartel. While her husband held the mayoral position, many have claimed Pineda Villa's forceful presence at City Council meetings was evidence that she was the one \\"calling the shots\\" in terms of political decisions. In fact, at the time of the disappearances, she had already been tapped by Abarca's PRD party to run as the next mayor of Iguala. While the event scheduled on September 26, 2014 was supposedly to celebrate her role advancing Iguala's welfare program, many believe it was actually the unofficial start of her mayoral election campaign.  Iguala disappearances, investigation and arrests  On September 26, 2014, around 100 male student teachers from the round 100 students from Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College travel by bus through the town of Iguala on their way to a demonstration in Mexico City. That night, municipal police in Iguala confront the students and open fire against them. Three students and three by-standers were killed and 43 students are forcibly disappeared as a result. On September 28, 2014, Guerrero State‚Äôs Attorney General opens an investigation into the mass kidnapping and killings. Iguala authorities arrest 22 local police officers and name the cartel Guerreros Unidos responsible for the crimes. On October 1, 2014, Mayor Abarca and Mar√≠a Pineda Villa go into hiding. On October 17, 2014, Mexico's Attorney General Murillo announced the arrest of who he deemed the \\"supreme leader\\" of the Guerreros Unidos cartel, Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado. In his interrogation, Casarrubias told authorities that Maria Pineda ordered the Guerreros Unidos to \\"make an example\\" of the missing students and identified her as the leader of the local police and the gang's highest-ranking member in government. On October 23, 2014, following political pressure and international outrage over the disappearances, Governor Aguirre resigned. On November 4, 2014, Major Abarca and Mar√≠a Pineda Villa are arrested in Mexico City and Abarca is sent to a maximum security prison. On January 5, 2015, Mar√≠a Pineda Villa is transferred from house arrest to the maximum security prison of \\"El Rincon\\"in Tepic, Nayarit. She has been charged with federal crimes of organized crime and conducting operations with illicit funds.

Description In 424 B.C., in the course of the Peloponnesian War, the Spartan general Brasidas managed to persuade Acanthos, an ally of Athens on the Chalcidice peninsula, to defect from their alliance. Then, the Acanthians sided with the Lacaedemonians and fought against Athens.Thucydides. 4.84-88 From the booty of the battles, including the battle of Lyncestis, they built a treasury in the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi, commemorating the joint victory. Plutarch in his \\"Life of Lysander\\" mentions the dedicatory inscription: Brasidas and the Acanthians from the Athenians.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Lysander, 1.1 The commemoration of the name of Brasidas would have constituted an unusually great honour, if it was written while he was still alive.Currie, B., 2005, Pindar and the Cult of Heroes, Oxford In the Classical period it was not a common practice to write the name of leaders or individuals on such dedications, particularly if the latter constituted collective offerings of an entire \\"polis\\" to the god. It has been thus suggested that the Treasury of the Acanthians was built after Brasidas' death in 422 B.C. However, there are also opposing views, supporting that the mention of the name indicated that Brasidas was still alive when the building was erected. Plutarch mentions that the statue which stood within the Treasury belonged to Lysander, despite the fact that many believed that it depicted Brasidas. Pausanias also mentions that at the treasury of the Acanthians stood a chryselephantine trireme, donated by Cyrus the Younger. Behind the treasury of the Acanthians in the Roman period a gate opened onto the sacred precinct, leading to the so-called \\"House of the Peristyle\\", dated to the 1st century A.D.

It is situated on Hack Kampmanns Plads in the city center by the waterfront next to the Custom House. Dokk1 is part of the much larger development project Urban Mediaspace Aarhus, jointly financed by Aarhus Municipality and Realdania for 2.1 billion DKK.Dokk1 og Havnebyrum Urban Mediaspace Aarhus It is designed by schmidt hammer lassen architects and Kristine Jensen, with construction managed by NCC AB. Construction broke ground 8 June 2011 and the building was inaugurated four years later on 20 June 2015. The name of the building was determined by a public contest held in the autumn of 2012. The combination of letters and number can be pronounced as \\"dokken\\", \\"dok √©n\\" or \\"dok √©t\\", meaning The Dock or Dock One in English. The term references the location on the former industrial harbor by the waterfront.  The building  Dokk1 houses the Aarhus Main Library, the municipal public services department, theater scenes, businesses and a large automated underground parking facility. The building contains of floorspace, with used by the library and for let by businesses. The remainder of the building is mainly the underground parking facility which features an automated lift system and space for 1000 vehicles. The structure will be integrated with the light rail system with trains running through and under the building including a station. = Architecture = The Dokk1 project represents a trend of combining different cultural purposes under one roof along with commercial or business functions. The building houses both public library, municipal services and concert/theater space while the upper floor of the building is for let and the parking garage in the basement is privately operated. Other examples from Denmark comprise Nordvests Culture House, √òrestad's School and Kulturv√¶rftet in Helsing√∏r. The neo-futuristic building is designed as a heptagonal metal disc floating above a glass prism which rests on a bed of wide irregular staircases to all sides. The metal disc holds offices and administration while the glass prism houses the public library, designed to be transparent to all sides and making all activities within visible from the outside, while providing a view across the harbour, bay, forest and city from within. = Sustainability = Dokk1 has been built and designed with a clear focus on a low energy consumption and sustainability, both in the construction phase and in the long-term operational phase and it meets the Danish class 2015 low energy requirements. Among the many initiatives, a 2,432 m2 solar panel has been added to the roof, seawater is used as a coolant for both excessive heat and ventilation and LED lights are used extensively. Robust, natural, environmentally friendly and recyclable materials have been used for the constructions. Sustainability are among the seven core values for Dokk1. = Accessibility = Accessibility has also been given a high priority at Dokk1. This has been obtained by the use of special designs, furnishings and technology. Elevators, escalators, inclines, adaptable counters, hearing loop systems and pictogram signage are among the solutions. Dokk1 is accessible via a station of Aarhus Letbane just before the lower entrance. = Art = In the planning for the project, 1% of the cost was set aside for art and decoration. Above the central staircase in the library hangs a large bronze pipe bell designed by Kirstine Roepstorff. It is 25 feet long, 2.5 feet wide and weighs close to 3 metric tonnes. The bell is connected to the Aarhus University Hospital where parents can push a button to activate it when their newborns have been successfully delivered. Outside, below the central staircase and in the ceiling of the underground carpark, is another large art installation, known as Magic Mushrooms. Invented by the Berlin-based art-cooperative Elmgreen & Dragset, Magic Mushrooms consists of a 300 m2 downscaled 1:100 model of an imaginary city, turned upside down.Magic Mushrooms Urban Media Space = Playgrounds = A four section outside playground adorns the broad encircling concrete deck. Known as Kloden (The Globe), each section represents various cultures and regions of the world. In the south there is a jungle, a large ape and drawings reminiscent of Egypthian hieroglyphs; all representing the African continent. In the East is an Asian dragon and a bear, representing Russia and Eastern Europe. White wooden platforms fastened on heavy springs are imitating floating sheets of ice from the Arctic in the northern section and a large wooden eagle at an erupting vulcano represents Iceland and the American continent in the west.Legepladsen Kloden Dokk1 = Wind Panel Scandal = The climate of Denmark includes long periods of sustained wind and rain, which requires special materials and construction techniques. In June 2016, it was reported that the of MgO boards, used as wind-barriers behind the building's outward facade, had absorbed water, causing rust and material damages. Over time the damages would evolve and become structural and catastrophic, if the boards were left in place. Workers began changing the plates in September 2016, but the financial aspects of the case has not been settled yet; tax payers will likely foot the bill for the repairs. A leading Danish building expert has estimated the cost to be 19-26 million Danish kroner (5 mil ‚Ç¨). Since 2014, the use of MgO plates has caused (and could potentially cause) significant structural damage to buildings in Denmark, and Dokk1 is just one of several costly cases in the country.

Legeplads p√• Dokk1.jpgOutside playgrounds  Library and culture center  The library is Aarhus Main Library, the largest in the municipality and the central book repository and administration of local libraries within the municipality. It is also the largest public library in Scandinavia. The library is split across two levels containing various departments such as literary fiction, professional literature, magazines, newspapers, media, exhibitions, a caf√© area, several lounges and a section for children of different ages. There are two event halls, intended for talks, lectures, small concerts, theatre and film screenings. The large hall (Danish: Store Sal) has room for 300 seats, and the small hall (Danish: Lille Sal) has room for 70 seats. The library also includes specially equipped study, reading, and meeting rooms and public computers. The library is situated in a transparent glass structure circumvented by a wide outdoor pathway. The outdoor pathway has four playgrounds collectively referred to as Kloden (The Globe) and recreational areas. An innovative cornerstone behind the development of Dokk1, is how citizens and organisations are participating and incorporated in the design processes of the library and cultural center, both in the original design of the place and in the ever-evolving designs of the center's future. In cooperation with the international design-organisation IDEO and Chicago Public Libraries, a general design tool kit was developed in 2013-14 that could also be applied for future libraries in order to facilitate changes on a global scale. The tool kit development was financially supported by the Global Libraries program, a branch of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Description The Pythaids were \\"theories\\", i.e. processions of the Athenians to Delphi. They took place in non canonical periods, usually following specific omens. The Pythaids that we know best of were four particularly majestic processions which took place between 138/7 ‚Äì 98/7 B.C. They constituted a clear effort of the Athenians to link their ancestral myths to the Apollonian mythology. The starting point of the Pythaids remains unknown; however the literary sources mention that they were already taking place in the 4th century B.C. It seems that they were interrupted in the 3rd century B.C., but they started again in the 2nd century B.C., in a period when Athens regained its prestige with the generous benefactions of the Hellenistic kings of Asia Minor. Our main sources for the Pythaids remain the lengthy inscriptions which were carved on the external walls of the Athenian Treasury,Syll.¬≥ 696-699 and 711, Greek inscriptions in English translation recording the names of the participants and other useful detail. As far as literary sources are concerned, the main testimony belongs to Strabo,Strabo, Geography, 9.2.11 who mentions Aelius Aristides and Ephoros, as well as the lexicographers. Furthermore, a careful reading of the Delphic Hymns to Apollo illuminates the mythological connections that the Athenians tried to establish. Thus, Apollo is born under an olive tree, the sacred tree of the goddess Athena, a fact which reflects the Athenian supremacy over the Delian League and its treasury. Furthermore, the tragedy \\"Ion\\" by Euripides aims at justifying the worship of Apollo \\"patroos\\" in Athens: Kreousa, mother of Ion, falls victim of rape by Apollo. She abandons the newborn in a remote region, from where Hermes, under order of Apollo, transfers him to Delphi, to be brought up by Pythia. The land route between Athens and Delphi is said to have been opened for the purpose of facilitating the Athenians to visit the sanctuary of Apollo. It was said that this road was full of bandits, that Theseus managed to disperse. The particularly majestic procession of 138/7 B.C. is a token of the ambition of the Athenians to demonstrate their renewed control over Delos through the clerouchies. The participation of officials and plain citizens in so large numbers aimed at manifesting a unified and unbreachable citizen body, consisting of free citizens. The rituals The exact rituals which took place are more or less unknown to us. It seems, however, that upon the arrival of the procession to Delphi the participants offered presents to the god, among which a tripod. Then a ritual cleansing took place, which was accomplished with the use of fire, which the Athenians took them back to their city by means of a torch. An effort was made to identify the rituals with historic and mythological events, such as the killing of Python, paralleled to the defeat of the Gauls in the 3rd century B.C.

For $25,000, investors could buy desks at Bar Works locations and then lease them back to the company. It has been noted that elements of the investment program are akin to a Ponzi scheme. Bar Works is now defunct and its founder, Renwick Haddow, has been arrested and charged.  Locations  The first Bar Works venue, at 47 West 39th Street, was opened at the end of October 2015 and had 200 work units, plus meeting and networking areas. Though superficially a shared office space, the venue was dependent on the coffee bar operating inside for revenue. Following the coffee bar's decision to pull out of the space, Bar Works announced in June 2017 that the location would be shutting down due to difficulties in otherwise generating business. Barworks 47 West 39th St The second location in Manhattan‚Äôs Times Square opened for business in February 2016. The Times Square space occupied 4,500 square foot with a capacity for 300 people. It shut down in early 2017 following difficulties attracting a steady client base. In June 2016, Bar Works announced plans to open a 6,000 sq ft co-working space at Jack's Restaurant in San Francisco after acquiring the freehold to the second oldest restaurant in the city. In May 2017 it was announced that the building would be converted from a co-working space into a restaurant unaffiliated with Bar Works.  Bar Works Investment  Bar Works sold workspaces to investors, starting at $25,000 each. The investors then leased the spaces back to Bar Works for a period of 10 years. The leaseback investment offers guaranteed returns of 14% per annum. In response to skepticism of such high guaranteed returns over such a long period of time, Bar Works hired unnamed auditors to review the company, who described the business model as \\"bomb-proof\\". Payment problems and legal issues In April 2017 Bar Works issued a statement to investors describing \\"difficulties with its banking facilities\\", alluding to disruptions in investment returns in the foreseeable future. In May 2017 Bar Works issued a statement to investors informing them that their monthly lease payments would again be delayed due to \\"productive restructuring\\". CEO Franklin Kinard told investors later in the month that he believed payments would resume after June 1. In order to reassure investors that Bar Works workspaces are operating and not empty, Kinard also described the company's efforts to provide \\"video feeds of the activity in our buildings\\", an uncommon practice in the shared workspace industry. Kinard resigned from his position and left Bar Works before the end of May 2017. Shortly after Kinard's resignation from Bar Works, Brad Fiorilla became the Director of Sales. Fiorilla was previously general manager of UFC Gym in Brighton Beach, New York. Though monthly lease payments remained suspended into June 2017 and locations continued to shut down, Bar Works announced it was opening two new venues in New York's Tribeca district, and Los Angeles' Hollywood. Before the end of the month, the Tribeca location's signage had been removed, and a juice bar was operating out of the space. On June 16, 2017, 27 investors from the People's Republic of China who had invested over $3 million in the Bar Works companies filed suit in New York County Supreme Court. They claimed that the companies were a Ponzi Scheme orchestrated by Renwick Haddow, who kept his controlling role in the company hidden. The Chinese investors also claimed that Bar Works defaulted almost immediately on its payment commitments and that it fraudulently solicited investments in locations that it never planned to open. On June 21, 2017 a second lawsuit was filed against the company by Plentium Capital Group Corporation in Florida Federal court. The plaintiffs claimed that $25 million of raised funds were immediately defaulted upon, and that management links to prior Ponzi schemes were hidden from marketing materials. On June 30, 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges against Haddow, \\"the clandestine founder of a purported Bitcoin platform and a chain of co-working spaces located in former bars and restaurants, alleging that he bilked investors in both companies while hiding his connection given his checkered past with regulators in the U.K.\\" On 25 July 2017, Haddow was arrested attempting to enter Morocco. On 13 April 2018, he was extradited to the US where he is facing charges related to Bar Works as well as Bitcoin Store, another allegedly fraudulent operation. Each charge carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.

Supposedly cut by local parish clerk Henry Eatwell in 1838 to commemorate the coronation of Queen Victoria, the horse is . The horse is regularly scoured and maintained. Origins and early history The horse is said to commemorate the coronation of Queen Victoria. The origin of the horse is uncertain,Wiltshire White Horses: The Hackpen or Broad Hinton or Winterbourne Bassett white horse and is sometimes said to be the only 19th century white horse to have little of its history known.Hackpen White Horse It is generally regarded that the horse was cut in 1838 by Henry Eatwell, a parish clerk of Broad Hinton, assisted by a local pub landlord. It is said to commemorate the coronation of Queen Victoria. Description and location The horse is cut of chalk, is , making it the only square-dimension horse in England, and faces west-northwest. Although Hackpen Hill is high (), it is a gentle slope, especially when compared to the hills of most other Wiltshire horses. Because the hill is gentle, the horse is partly banked up and slightly raised from the surrounding grass to make it more easily visible. The head was initially elevated to help with the foreshortening. The best view of the horse is said to be from the nearby B4041 road, whilst the A361 road near Broad Hinton also provides a clear view. At the top of the hill is a car park where the Ridgeway crosses the B4041 road, and a footpath stretches from there down to the horse, making the horse accessible to the public. Ironically, many real horses often roam the field.Walking the Wessex White Horses - Hackpen It has been suggested that the stones for Stonehenge and Avebury may have come from a field of sarsen stones just to the south east of its location. The expression \\"as different as chalk and cheese\\" is sometimes believed to refer to the land divided by Hackpen Hill. The hill forms the boundary between the high chalk downs to the south of it and the clay cattle country to the north, where cheese is a product of the milk from the cattle, so the two areas \\"are as different as chalk and cheese.\\"Wiltshire White Horses: Folklore and legends Hackpen White Horse was not the only hillside shape cut to commemorate Queen Victoria; in 1887, for her Golden Jubilee, a hillside row of trees were planted in the shape of a \\"V\\" in Westmeston, Sussex.Artists and the South Downs - South Downs National Park Authority The horse ties \\"neck-and-neck\\" with Broad Town White Horse as the closest white horse to Swindon. Scouring and recent history Hackpen White Horse in 2007. The horse is regularly scoured (cleaned and maintained). In either May or June 2000, John Wain cleaned it single-handedly, taking him some five hours. He later flew David Brewer over the area to photograph the village of Broad Hinton and the white horse for brewers's book Images of a Wiltshire Downland Village: Broad Hinton and Uffcott. Wain cleaned it annually until Bevan Pope cleaned the horse single-handedly on 23 September 2004. Wain cleaned the horse again with the help of a group of friends on 1 February 2011 and 4 February 2012. On both occasions, they illuminated the newly cleaned horse when the work was completed. Although to illuminate a white horse has been sporadic tradition for other horses in Wiltshire, those occasions marked the first times it had been done for Hackpen White Horse.Wiltshire White Horses: Lighting up the horses In March 2009, the horse was transformed into a \\"red horse\\" for the Comic Relief charity's Red Nose Day campaign; this was achieved by covering the horse's shape with numerous red sheets and fabrics.BBC - Wiltshire - Comic Relief - Hackpen White Horse goes red!

Early life and education Thomas was born in Menai Bridge, Anglesey on 2 May 1912. His family included his parents, Jeanette and Rev. W. Keinion Thomas, and siblings Gwyn, Alon, Iwan, Jac, and Truda. He attended Beaumaris Grammar School after having been home-schooled. He studied Semitic and Hebrew Languages in Bangor and graduated with honors from the University College of North Wales in 1934. From Mansfield College, Oxford, he received a M.A. in theology. He also received a B.D. He then traveled to Berlin in 1937, where he had planned to complete his doctoral dissertation. At that time, though, the political climate and the threat of war in Nazi Germany made the situation untenable. Career He became a lecturer in Hebrew at the University College in 1938, and was later made senior lecturer. During that time, he was at Toronto University as a visiting lecturer on occasion. For one year, he worked in Canaan at an archaeological site. Thomas retired in 1977. Thomas was an author, translator, and editor. He wrote A primer of Old Testament text criticism, the first edition was published in 1947 and the second edition in 1961, and was co-author of Gramadeg Hebraeg y Beibl, which was published in 1976. His co-author was Gwilym H. Jones. In 1962, his first edition of the translation of the two-volume Norweigen work The Psalms in Israel's Worship by Sigmund Mowinckel was published. He also translated works of Martin Noth and Otto Eissfeldt and helped translate the Old Testament for the New Welsh Bible. Between 1976 and 1990, the University of Wales Press published a series he edited, Beibl a Chrefydd. He was secretary of Colleg Bala-Bangor, secretary and president of the Society for Old Testament Study, and president of the Union of Welsh Independents.

A regular consultant of his more eminent contemporaries, he is credited with the discovery of Primula scotica and Salix caprea pendula.  Biography  Smith was born in Ayrshire, Scotland around 1763. Sometime in the eighteenth century, he established a nursery at his home on the Monkwood estate near Minishant along the River Doon, which eventually became the Monkwood Botanic Garden. At Monkwood he amassed a large collection of rare and valuable plants which, according to Loudon‚Äôs Encyclopaedia of Gardening, comprised thirty-five hundred different species of both exotic and indigenous varieties. At his nursery, he employed and mentored his future son-in-law, the botanist John Goldie for whom Dyopteris goldieana is named. Passing through Monkwood on one occasion, the poet Hew Ainslie wrote in his A Pilgrimage in the Land of Burns (1820) that Smith's garden was \\"paradisiacal\\", where plants \\"of all nations were seated most brotherly together, drinking of the same dews, and dancing to the piping of the same breeze\\". alt= Owing to his vast botanical knowledge and equally formidable collection of plants, Smith was regularly consulted by such contemporary botanists as Sir William Jackson Hooker and Sir James Edward Smith who included his information on botanical subjects in their works.

Built about 1800, it is a well-preserved local example of Federal architecture, and was home to figures influential in the development of the Hillsville area where it stands. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history The Barnes-Hill House is located in a rural-residential area of northern Spencer, on the north side of North Brookfield Road a short way west of its junction with North Spencer Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. A two-story wing extends to the left, and a 1-1/2 story wing extends to the right and partially to the rear, giving the house a partial saltbox profile. The main entrance has a Greek Revival surround, with sidelight windows, fluted pilasters, and a corniced entablature. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, somewhat unusual for a period when center hall plans were more common. Thought by local historians to date to the 1760s (supposedly built by David Barnes), it was more likely built c. 1800. Its most prominent owner was Sullivan Hill, whose family was related to the Barneses by marriage. He established a chair factory across the street from the house, spurring the development of a small village centered on the nearby road junction called Hillsville. Hill is said to have introduced the cane- seated chair to Massachusetts. The house remained in the Hill family until 1929.

After significant early work on Middle Indo-Aryan dialects (Prakrits) she had specialised in Australian Aboriginal languages since 1963, when she took it up as a hobby. Works authored or co-authored by her are influential, and often among the primary resource materials on many languages of Australia. Life and career Hercus was born Luise Anna Schwarzschild on 16 January 1926 in Munich, Germany, to the artist Alfred and his wife Theodora Schwarzschild. The family descended from a long line of rabbis, merchants and intellectuals. On the assumption of power by Hitler in Germany, their position as Jewish people rapidly deteriorated, despite financial assistance from an uncle who had emigrated to the United States. With her family she took refuge in England in 1938, and the family settled in East Finchley, in northern London where she attended Tollington Hill School. The family, during the air raids over London, moved to Hampstead Gardens. She won a scholarship at 17 to St Anne's College, Oxford, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in Oriental Studies in 1946, followed by an M.A. In 1948 she was appointed tutor and lecturer at St. Anne's College, a position she held until 1954, when she emigrated to Australia. She married the scientist Graham Robertson Hercus, on 23 February 1955 (deceased 1974). Together they had one child, Iain Robertson Hercus, who obtained a doctorate in astronomy. From 1965 to 1969 she was a research fellow at the University of Adelaide, South Australia. It was at this time that she began to pursue private studies in Aboriginal languages, managing to pull some from the brink of oblivion, as for example with Wangganguru which she recorded with the assistance of her informant, Mick McLean Irinjili. After 1969 she took up an appointment as senior lecturer and then reader in Sanskrit, in the Department of South Asian and Buddhist Studies at the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.. In the 1970s, Hercus, along with Peter K. Austin and David Trefry, did research on the Diyari language. Luise had been publishing significant articles on linguistic features of Middle Indo-Aryan dialects (Prakrits) since 1953 (using her maiden name) and a collected volume reprinting and indexing these was published by the ANU Faculty of Asian Studies in 1991 (her last article on this topic was in 1979). After 1991 she became a visiting fellow in the Department of Linguistics at ANU, writing up grammars, dictionaries and traditional texts, and continuing fieldwork mainly in the north of South Australia and adjacent areas of New South Wales and Queensland.Luise Hercus - ANU Press http://press.anu.edu.au/press- author/luise-hercus/ A Festschrift was presented to Dr Hercus on the occasion of her retirement in 1990. In January 2016, AIATSIS presented Hercus with digital copies of the foundational sound recordings, of which she had made over 1,000 hours ranging over 56 native languages and dialects,Obituary, AIATSIS News and events, Apr. 27, 2018. as a token of gratitude in celebrating her 90th birthday. Among the material, are unique sounding recordings of Pantyikali, Nukunu, Woiwurrung, Dadi Dadi, Djadjala, Gunnai, Narungga, Wadi Wadi, Wergaia, Kurnu, and Nari Nari. In addition, a second Festschrift, the book, Language, land and song: Studies in honour of Luise Hercus, with contributions from over 30 scholars, was published online in 2017, to honour her lifelong engagement with Aboriginal people and their languages. Indigenous languages Hercus wrote on, among others, the following languages (and their dialects): * Arabana-Wangkangurru * Kaurna * Nukunu * Nauo * Paakantyi (Baagandji, Bagundji) * Thura-Yura languages * Mirndi * Nungali * Yarli languages Besides Australian languages, Hercus also studied Romance and early Indian languages.Hercus, L. A. (Luise Anna) 1926- http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n84094231/ Works Hercus was a prolific author, with 163 works to her credit at WorldCat Identities, but perhaps best known for the following works: * (1965) The languages of Victoria: A late survey in two parts. * (1981) The Bagandji language.

It was passed on December 21, 2000, as title XI of .  History  The LIFE Act was one of many legislative changes surrounding immigration enforcement in the United States that sought to compromise between the goal of ending unauthorized migration and recognizing the interests of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents in being together with their families. = Family-based and employment-based immigration and the development of long waiting times = The basic framework for family-based and employment-based immigration was laid out in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, and the categories were expanded, with a clear preference ordering, with the Immigration Act of 1990. The INA placed a limit of 20,000 on the number of immigrants from each country of chargeability within each year.Section 202(b)I of the INA , Immigration and Nationality Act, section 202(b)I. For large countries in particular (such as India, China, and Mexico), this limit was much less than the number of people who sought to migrate through family-based and employment-based migration. This led to many cases of people who had approved petitions for family-based or employment-based immigration but needed to wait several years in order to be able to legally immigrate or adjust status to that of Lawful Permanent Resident. Some of these people stayed in the United States, going out of status, while others waited outside the United States for long periods of time. = Growth of the removal/deportation machinery = Until the 1980s, most removals of unauthorized aliens happened through formal removal proceedings that involved a hearing before an immigration judge. However, in the 1990s, the United States government decided to add to its toolkit of removal strategies to deal with the scale of presence of unauthorized aliens, a trend that has continued through the 2000s and 2010s. Some of the summary removal procedures introduced over this time include expedited removal (launched 1996/1997), stipulated removal (launched 1995), reinstatement of removal (launched 1998), and administrative removal for aggravated felons (introduced 1988, expanded with the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996). = Previous steps = In 1994, the United States Congress enacted Section 245(i) of the INA, permitting certain individuals who were otherwise ineligible for adjustment of status in the United States to pay a penalty fee for the convenience of adjusting status without leaving the United States. Prior to enactment of the LIFE Act Amendments, the window for preserving adjustment eligibility under Section 245(i) ended or cut off on January 14, 1998, after which only \\"grandfathered\\" individuals (beneficiaries of labor certifications or immigrant visa petitions filed on or before that date) were eligible to adjust status under Section 245(i) . The cut-off date of Section 245(i) changed several times; however, then President Clinton signed into law a provision that changed the nature of Section 245(i) to \\"grandfather\\" those individuals in the United States for whom an immigrant visa or application for labor certification was filed on or before January 14, 1998. = Legislative process = The original legislation that would eventually give rise to the LIFE Act was the Latino Immigrant Fairness Act (LIFA) sponsored by Democratic Party members. The LIFE Act emerged as a compromise after negotiation with Republican legislators who argued that while they were supportive of family reunification, they also wanted safeguards against incentivizing and rewarding the breaking of United States immigration laws. The LIFE Act was passed on December 21, 2000. The LIFE Act was one of two major immigration-related legislations that was passed in late 2000. The other major legislation was the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, that focused more on employment-based immigration and temporary worker statuses, particularly the H-1B visa.  Provisions  The LIFE Act had four major provisions: # The USCIS would overlook unlawful entry and unlawful presence when considering some Adjustment of Status applications for people whose Form I-130 or Form I-140 had been filed by April 30, 2001 (with a number of additional caveats). # A new V visa was introduced for Form I-130 beneficiaries (primarily, spouses of United States lawful permanent residents) whose Form I-130 had been filed by December 21, 2000 and had waited for at least three years. # The K-3/K-4 visa category was introduced for spouses of citizens to be able to enter the United States, with authority to work and study, while their Form I-130 was still pending. # Persons who filed before October 1, 2000, for class membership in one of three \\"late amnesty\\" lawsuits (CSS v. Meese, LULAC v. INS, and Zambrano v. INS) and who are eligible under the LIFE Act's amended legalization provisions may apply to adjust status during a 12-month period that begins once regulations are issued. Spouses and unmarried children of the class action claimants will be protected from certain categories of removal and will be eligible for work authorization if they entered the United States before December 1, 1988 and resided in the United States on that date. = Overlooking of unlawful presence if other conditions for obtaining a Green Card are met = The LIFE Act allows some people to obtain Green Cards (i.e., adjust to Lawful Permanent Resident status) regardless of the following factors that might otherwise create bars to obtaining Green Cards: * The manner they entered the United States * Working in the United States without authorization * Failing to continuously maintain lawful status since entry The Act only applies to people who already had an approved petition that they had applied for by April 30, 2001. Explicitly, the following conditions need to all be satisfied: * The applicant must be the beneficiary of a qualified immigrant petition (Form I-130 or Form I-140) or application for labor certification (necessary for some Form I-140) filed on or before April 30, 2001. * In the case that the petition was filed between January 15, 1998 and April 30, 2001, the applicant must have been physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000. There is no requirement of physical presence for petitions filed earlier (which were already covered by previous versions of the ruling). * The applicant is currently the beneficiary of a qualifying immigrant petition (either the original Form I-130 or Form I-140 or a subsequently filed immigrant petition). * The applicant has a visa number immediately available. In the case of numerically limited categories, this means that the applicant's Priority Date must be current. * The applicant is admissible to the United States. * The qualifying petition or qualifying application for labor certification must have been \\"properly filed\\", (i.e., signed and submitted with the corrected fees) and \\"approvable\\" (meritorious based on the facts and \\"non-frivolous\\") when filed. In order to apply under this provision of the LIFE Act, one must file Supplement A along with Form I-485 for Adjustment of Status. It is also important to note that the petition used for Adjustment of Status may be different from the original petition with a date prior to April 30, 2001 that is used as a basis for being eligible for the LIFE Act. There is also a penalty fee for the convenience of being able to adjust status without having to physically leave the United States that must be included as part of the application.  Relation with removal proceedings  It is important to note that protection from removal proceedings (as well as from summary removal procedures such as reinstatement of removal) kicks in only after the Form I-485, along with Supplement A, has been properly filed and a visa number is available to the applicant. Until then, removal proceedings may be initiated against the person for unauthorized entry or unlawful presence. If the person eligible under this provision of the LIFE Act departs the United States after accruing unlawful presence, the person may be subject to a 3-year or 10-year bar to re-entry (depending on the extent of unlawful presence) despite the fact that, had the person continued to stay in the United States, the person could have applied to adjust status. = V visa = The V visa is a visa category introduced as part of the LIFE Act. A person is eligible for a V visa if both these conditions are satisfied: * A Form I-130 petition was filed on or before December 21, 2000 listing that person as beneficiary. * It has been at least three years since the Form I-130 petition was filed, and the petition is either still being processed or has been processed but the associated immigrant visa or Adjustment of Status application is still pending. While the V visa in principle applies to all categories listed on the Form I-130, it is rarely needed for people in the IR category (i.e., the spouses or immediate relatives of US citizens) because these are uncapped categories, so that a visa can be obtained within a few months of USCIS approval, and USCIS processing times are generally not more than a year. The V visa is most relevant for the F category of Form I-130, which is numerically capped, and where the wait time for one's Priority Date to become current can be several years. The V visa status may be obtained in these two ways, depending on where the beneficiary is: * If the beneficiary is already in the United States, then he/she can apply using Form I-539 (Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status) along with Form I-693. * If the beneficiary is outside the United States, he/she needs to go through consular processing, i.e., get a visa from a United States consulate. The V visa allows the Form I-130 beneficiary to travel to the United States and engage in work and study there, while waiting for the Priority Date to become current so as to be able to apply for an immigrant visa and/or for Adjustment of Status. Since the V visa applies only for Form I-130 petitions that were filed on or before December 21, 2000, its relevance has declined over time. Proposals to expand the scope to applications filed later have been stalled. = K-3/K-4 visas = K-3 and K-4 visas were created as part of the LIFE Act. These are non- immigrant visas intended for the spouse (K-3 visa) and dependents under age 21 of the spouse (K-4 visa) of a United States citizen. The following are the eligibility requirements for the K-3 visa: * The visa applicant must be married to a United States citizen * The visa applicant must have a pending Form I-130 petition filed by the U.S. citizen spouse listing him/her as beneficiary. A child may be eligible for the K-4 visa if he or she is unmarried, under 21, and the child of a qualified K-3 nonimmigrant visa applicant. In order for the applicant to obtain the K-3 visa, the U.S. citizen spouse must file a Form I-129F listing the applicant as beneficiary (this is in addition to the pending Form I-130 petition). The K-3 status (and any dependent K-4 status) automatically expires 30 days after any of these: * The USCIS denies or revokes the Form I-130 petition * The USCIS denies or revokes the Adjustment of Status application by the K-3 nonimmigrant * The marriage is terminated through divorce or annulment  References  Category:Acts of the 106th United States Congress Category:United States federal immigration and nationality legislation ","title":"Legal Immigration Family Equity Act"},{"id":"49374978","text":"Talent Team Papendal (TTPA) is a Dutch volleyball club based in Arnhem.

Specifically pest risk analysis is a term used within the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) (Article 2.1) and is defined within the glossary of phytosanitary terms.FAO (2015) ISPM No 5. Glossary of phytosanitary terms. FAO Rome, 34 pp. as \\"the process of evaluating biological or other scientific and economic evidence to determine whether an organism is a pest, whether it should be regulated, and the strength of any phytosanitary measures to be taken against it\\". In a phytosanitary context, the term plant pest, or simply pest, refers to any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products and includes plant pathogenic bacteria, fungi, fungus-like organisms, viruses and virus like organisms, as well as insects, mites, nematodes and weeds.

The principal international agreement aimed at addressing the spread of plant pests through international trade is the International Plant Protection Convention, a multilateral treaty for international cooperation in plant protection aimed at preventing the spread of pests of plants and plant products, and promoting appropriate measures for their control (IPPC, Article I.1). In accordance with the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement the IPPC aims to protect plants while limiting interference with international trade.Work, T.T., McCullough, D.G., Cavey, J.F. & Komsa, R.

L. & Britton, K. O. (2012) Live plant imports: the major pathway for forest insect and pathogen invasions of the US. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 10, 135‚Äì143. A key principle of the IPPC is that contracting parties (signatories) provide ‚Äòtechnical justification‚Äô to support phytosanitary decision making affecting trade.FAO (2002) Guide to the international plant protection convention. FAO Rome, 20 pp. The IPPC recognises pest risk analysis as the appropriate format for such technical justification. The responsibility for conducting pest risk analysis sits within government, specifically within a country‚Äôs National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) and comes as an obligation when countries become contracting parties to the IPPC (IPPC Article IV, 2a). IPPC standards, referred to as International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM), have been developed to assist NPPOs.

Plant Protection Service (NL) and Central Science Laboratory (UK) joint Pest Risk Analysis. as can disputes over phytosanitary measures. Within the initiation stage of a pest risk analysis the reason for conducting the analysis, the identity of the pest and or pathways being analysed and the area in relation to which the analysis is conducted (the pest risk analysis area) is provided. = Stage 2: pest risk assessment= There are three steps to the assessment of pest risk. *Step 1: Pest categorization The purpose of pest categorization is to determine whether a pest identified during the initiation stage satisfies the criteria of being a quarantine pest. A quarantine pest is a pest of potential economic importance to the area endangered thereby and not yet present there, or present but not widely distributed and being officially controlled. Pest categorization includes all the main elements considered in Step 2 of a pest risk assessment but the elements are considered in less detail and pest categorization is essentially a quick assessment of whether the analysis should continue. The categorization step provides an opportunity to eliminate a pest from analysis at an early stage in the pest risk analysis process thus avoiding unnecessary in-depth examination. Pest categorization can be done with relatively little information, provided that the information available is sufficient to carry out the categorization. *Step 2: Assessment of pest entry, establishment and spread. Assessing the likelihood of pest entry requires assessment of each of the pathways with which a pest may be associated, from its origin to its establishment in the pest risk analysis area. In a pest risk analysis initiated by a specific pathway, often an imported commodity or goods associated with an imported commodity, e.g. packing materials, the probability of pest entry is evaluated for that specific pathway. For a pest risk analysis initiated for a specific pest, all probable pathways are evaluated for that individual pest. To estimate the likelihood of establishment of a pest, biological information about the pest including its life cycle, its hosts or habitat needs, or a diseases epidemiology, together with characteristics of the abiotic environment affecting pest survival such as temperature, precipitation and perhaps soil type affecting its geographic range limit need to be considered. The environmental conditions under which the pest does not survive are also important to understand. Conditions in the pest risk analysis area can then be compared with conditions in areas where the pest survives, and in areas where the pest is known not to be able to survive, so as to assess the likelihood that the pest will establish in the pest risk analysis area. Computer simulation models can be used to inform assessments of likelihood of establishment.Venette, R.C. (Ed), \\"Pest Risk Modelling and Mapping for Invasive Alien Species\\", CABI Wallingford. 2015. 252pp.Sutherest, R.W. (2014) Pest species distribution modelling: origins and lessons from history. Biological Invasions 16, 239‚Äì256 When assessing the likelihood and magnitude of pest spread, the pest‚Äôs ability to disperse from a point of introduction to new areas within the pest risk analysis area is assessed. The assessment should consider pest population dynamics and the natural mobility of the pest and take into account potential spread via wind, water, soil, seed and pollen, and insect, fungal or nematode vectors as well as spread via human activities such as movement of host material. *Step 3: Assessment of potential consequences resulting from pest entry, establishment and spread. In this step the potential impacts that could be expected to result from a pest's introduction and spread is identified, described and, as much as possible, quantified.

Food Security 2, 113‚Äì132 Information on the species impacts in areas where it is already present, and particularly in areas where it has already spread to, together with information influencing the elements of risk in the pest risk analysis area, inform the assessment of potential consequences. Impacts reported from invaded areas are recognized as the best indicator of potential impacts in the pest risk analysis area . However, regarding environmental impacts, if the pest has not previously spread then the absence of any environmental impact in the area of pest origin should not be interpreted to mean that no environmental impact should be expected in the pest risk analysis area. This is because environmental impacts are difficult to predict and a lack of impact in the origin is not a good predictor that there will be no impacts in regions where a pest is introduced.Kenis, M., Bacher, S., Baker, R.H.A., Branquart, E., Brunel, S., Holt, J., Hulme, P.E., MacLeod, A., Pergl, J., Petter, F., Pysek, P. Schrader, G., Sissons, A. & Starfinger, U. (2012) New protocols to assess the environmental impact of pests in the EPPO decision-support scheme for pest risk analysis. EPPO Bulletin 42 (1), 21‚Äì27. Recognising that risk is a combination of likelihood and consequences, the results of steps 2 and 3 are combined to provide an overall estimation of pest risk. = Stage 3: pest risk management= For a quarantine pest, pest risk management is the process of evaluation and selection of options to reduce the risk of introduction and spread of the pest. Conclusions from the pest risk assessment (Stage 2) are used to support decisions regarding the level of risk presented by the pest. If a pest is judged to present an unacceptable risk then phytosanitary measures should be identified that will reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Phytosanitary measures should accord with IPPC principles of necessity, managed risk, minimal impact, transparency, harmonization, non-discrimination and technical justification.FAO (2006) ISPM 1 Phytosanitary principles for the protection of plants and the application of phytosanitary measures in international trade. FAO Rome ISPM 11 provides more information about each stage of pest risk analysis for quarantine pests.  Level of detail required The level of detail in a pest risk analysis will be limited by the amount and quality of information available, the tools, and time available before a decision is required. Quantitative and qualitative techniques are used in pest risk analysis but pest risk analysis need only be as complex as is required by the circumstances to support a phytosanitary decision and provide the necessary technical justification to defend decisions regarding phytosanitary measures. Nevertheless, a pest risk analysis should be based on sound science, be transparent and consistent with other pest risk analyses conducted by the NPPO.  Uncertainty Estimating the likelihood of pest introduction and of the consequences that could result involves many uncertainties. Uncertainty is always part of pest risk analysis;Griffen, R. (2012) Uncertainty in pest risk analysis, p209-222. In: Devorshak, C. (Ed.) Plant Pest Risk Analysis Concepts and Application. CABI, Wallingford. 296pp. very often there is a lack of data necessary to reach secure conclusions. The subjective nature of pest risk analysis is also a source of uncertainty. ISPM 11 recognises that pest risk analysis involves many uncertainties, largely since estimates and extrapolations are made from real situations where the pest occurs to a hypothetical situation in the pest risk analysis area. In most cases analyses performed during pest risk analysis use historical data to forecast potential future events. It is important to document the areas of uncertainty and the degree of uncertainty in the assessment, and to indicate where expert judgement has been used. This is necessary for transparency and may also be useful for identifying and prioritizing research needs.Sansford CE (1999). Pest Risk Analysis in the UK: Its use to identify research opportunities for exotic plant pathogens. Proceedings of the National Office of Animal and Plant Health, Australia Workshop Plant Health in the New Global Trading Environment: Managing Exotic Insects, Weeds and Pathogens, February 23 ‚Äì24, 1999, 99‚Äì111.  Criticism of pest risk analysis Pest risk analysis, as conducted under the IPPC and SPS Agreement, has been criticised for being reactive, only coming into effect after a pest problem has been identified.Brasier, C.M. (2008). The biosecurity threat to the UK and global environment from international trade in plants. Plant Pathology 57 (5), 792‚Äì808. For example, many pests now subject to phytosanitary measures, supported by pest risk analysis, only became recognised as potential risks once they had already escaped from their geographical centres of origin and caused impacts in other parts of the world. Some ‚Äònewly escaped‚Äô organisms were previously unknown to science before they escapedBrasier, C.M. (2005) Preventing invasive pathogens: deficiencies in the system. The Plantsman 4, 54‚Äì57. and current international standards for pest risk analysis cannot assess risks from unknown organisms. In addition, a pest risk analysis will focus on a pest at the species level assuming the pest to be genetically stable but this can be a great oversimplification if the pest has a short generation time with capacity for rapid genetic change.Webber, J. (2010) Pest Risk Analysis and Invasion Pathways for Plant Pathogens. New Zealand Journal of Forestry Science 40 (supplement) S45-S56. During the assessment of impact, assessors focus on impacts on known hosts or habitats. However, if a pest adapts to a new host plantde Vienne DM, Hood ME & Giraud T (2009) Phylogenetic determinants of potential host shifts in fungal pathogens. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 22, 2532‚Äì2541.Gilbert GS & Webb CO (2007) Phylogenetic signal in plant pathogen-host range. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 104, 4979‚Äì4983. or habitat once established in the pest risk analysis area, impacts will be underestimated. Risk analyses for invasive species have also been criticised for being narrowly focused, subjective, often arbitrary and unquantified, and subject to political interference.

He was revered for his work on contemporary church history.Karl-Joseph Hummel, Michael Ki√üener (Ed.): Die Katholiken und das Dritte Reich. Kontroversen und Debatten. Paderborn u.a. 2009, p. 10. Life Konrad Repgen was born in 1923 at Friedrich-Wilhelms- H√ºtte, part of the conurbation of Troisdorf a short distance to the south-east of Cologne. His father was a teacher and an active member of the Catholic Centre Party. In January 1933 r√©gime change heralded a rapid switch to single- party government and Repgen's father, identified as an activist member of one of the \\"wrong\\" parties, lost his teaching job the same year. Konrad Repgen successfully completed his schooling at the Beethoven-Gymnasium (school) in Bonn in 1941. War had resumed in 1939 and Repgen was promptly conscripted into the army, serving as a soldier on the Russian Front till 1945. With the end of the war, in May 1945, he found himself captured by the British army and held as a prisoner of war till August of that year. Release came in time to enable him to enroll for the winter semester at Bonn University where over the next five years he studied History, Germanistics, Philosophy and Latin. While at university Repgen joined the Arminia Catholic student fraternity. He received his doctorate in 1950 for a dissertation on the March Movement and the May Elections which were features of the political turmoil of 1848 in the Rhineland. The work, which was supervised by , was adapted as a book and found a publisher a few years later. Between 1952 and 1955 Repgen undertook an extended period of research at the German Historical Institute in Rome. A signification landmark followed in 1958 when he received his habilitation for a piece of work entitled \\"The Roman Curia and the Peace of Westphalia. Pope, emperor and state.\\" (\\" Die r√∂mische Kurie und der Westf√§lische Friede. Papst, Kaiser und Reich\\"). He relocated from the Bonn area in 1962 when he was appointed to a full professorship at the Saarland University at Saarbr√ºcken where he remained till 1967. Back at Bonn that was he year in which his old teacher Max Braubach retired from the Konkordatslehrstuhl (teaching chair), and Repgen returned to Bonn to take it on. He remained at Bonn as a professor in Medieval and Modern history until his own retirement in 1988. Between 1985 and 1988 he was also dean of the Philosophy Faculty. Briefly, in 1975/76, he combined his duties at Bonn with a post as a visiting fellow at the University of Oxford. As a teacher at Saarbr√ºcken and Bonn he has supervised fifty doctorates and seven habilitations. His historian students include Winfried Baumgart, Franz Bosbach, , Ulrich von Hehl, , , and . A focus of Konrad Repgen's research work was editorial work covering early modern Europe, but he has also researched the political and social history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. He rejected the sociological-political historical prism favoured by the so-called Bielefeld School, and is regarded as a conservative among historians. For many years he headed up the long-running \\"Acta Pacis Westphalicae\\" project which publishes archive material covering the succession of congresses that eventually, in 1648, came up with what became known as the Peace of Westphalia. He has also published standard works on national and church history, among them \\"Drei√üigj√§hriger Krieg und Westf√§lischer Friede\\", for which in 1998 he won the History prize of the City of M√ºnster. (The city was much impacted by the war and involved in the treaties that concluded it.) In addition, between 1976 and 1997 he was in charge of the Archive Section at the Reich Chancellery covering the twelve years of the Hitler government. He is a member of the British Academy, of the (German) Commission for Contemporary History, the Commission for Parliamentary History and of Political Parties, the Historical Commission of the Bavarian Academy, and of the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts. In 1989 Repgen was appointed a Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. In 1995 he received an honorary doctorate from the Culture Faculty of the recently established University of Bayreuth. In 1998 he was honoured with the Ring of Honour from the G√∂rres Society, and in 2000 with the Prize of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation. He has been an advisory council member with the Munich based Institute for Contemporary History since 1972 and with the Italian-German Historical Institute since 1973.

Corpus Christi College, Cambridge He first embarked on legal training at Gray's Inn, where he was admitted on 2 March 1632, and then went on to university, being admitted to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1635. Following his father as a successful lawyer in London, he was knighted on 18 June 1641 at Whitehall Palace. In 1645, jointly with his mother, he became heir to his father's lands and considerable other assets. In 1648 a legacy of his father's work in Ireland resurfaced when the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors attempted to obtain evidences of their landholdings in County Londonderry. The original papers, they ascertained, were in the hands of Sir Ralph's three executors, who were his widow Dorothy, Sir Thomas Fotherley, the father of his son-in-law John Fotherley, and Herbert his eldest son.

The Stentrode device is implanted via the jugular vein into a blood vessel near the cortical tissue near the motor cortex and sensory cortex, so open brain surgery is avoided. Insertion via the blood vessel avoids direct penetration and damage of the brain tissue. As for blood clotting concerns, Oxley says neurologists routinely use permanent stents in patients' brains to keep blood vessels open. Once in place it expands to press the electrodes against the vessel wall close to the brain where it can record neural information and deliver currents directly to targeted areas. The signals are captured and sent to a wireless antenna unit implanted in the chest, which sends them to an external receiver. The patient would need to learn how to control a computer operating system that interacts with assistive technologies. The Stentrode technology has only been tested on sheep, and the device and procedure are currently under FDA review.A digital spinal cord that streams your thoughts. Thomas Oxley, TEDxSydney.

The film, directed by Jane Marsh and produced by Raymond Spottiswoode, described the work of Canadian women in uniform during the Second World War. The film's French version title is Carri√®res de femmes.  Synopsis  In 1943, Canadian women are making a significant contribution in the military, disproving the old saw, \\"in the home women are good for everything, outside it, good for nothing.\\" Other misconceptions about women's frailty, subservience to men and devotion to the pursuit of beauty have been in place for centuries. In modern times, when war came to Canada, Canadian women answered the call. Women signed up in the Canadian Women's Army Corps (CWAC), the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Woman's Division (WD) and the Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service (CWREN), taking on jobs that relieved men for combat duty. All new recruits went through the usual four-week basic training program, preparing them for military life. The everyday life in the forces included barracks living, marching and specialized gas mask drills, eating at the mess hall, and even recreation opportunities. Once basic training was over, women began to learn to handle many kinds of work. In the RCAF, women became clerks, drivers, photographers, air photo interpreters, weather observers, instrument mechanics, parachute riggers as well as staffing many administrative and technical positions. As a CWAC, women took over 21 types of army duties as secretaries, clerks, canteen workers, vehicle drivers and many other non-combat military jobs. As a CWREN, women served in 26 non- combatant occupations in Canadian naval bases at home or abroad. These jobs included cipher duties, clerical work, teleprinter operations, telephone switchboard operator, wireless telegraphic operator, coder duties, cook, steward, messenger, elevator operator and motor transport driver. All of the roles that Canadian women undertook in military service added to the immense contribution of women to Canada's fighting strength in the Second World War.

Retrieved: February 9, 2016. The film was created as a morale boosting propaganda film with another purpose, to dramatically depict women's changing roles in society. \\"This film ['Proudly She Marches'], made ostensibly to encourage female recruitment, concluded with positive observations about women in the present and future. Unfortunately, the female narrator was replaced by a male to make the points.\\"Evans 1984, p. 138. Proudly She Marches was a compilation documentary that relied heavily on newsreel material but also included original footage shot at military bases in Canada to provide the background to the dialogue. The unusual use of intertitles similar to those used in silent film, overlaid over film images, provided onscreen dialogue for the audience.Morris, Peter. \\"Film Reference Library: Canada Carries On.\\" Canadian Film Encyclopedia. Retrieved: February 9, 2016. Reception From an interview of Janey Martin, one of actors in Proudly She Marches, The Globe and Mail reporter in 1943, at the film's premiere, noted that she was \\"... chosen to represent the Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service in a National Film Board production which is a story of Canadian women in the air force, army and navy. Janey [Martin] has a featured role in 'Proudly She Marches', which is being shown in theatres across Canada now and for the next three months. Is she excited? No! ... The slim blonde naval typist from Windsor would rather be a WREN than a movie star, though she has qualifications for both positions. She considers herself quite an ordinary WREN, doing an ordinary sort of job, and coming from an ordinary background. But her part in the film is definitely more than ordinary ...\\"\\"More thrilled to be a Wren than to appear in a film play.\\" Globe and Mail, October 18, 1943. Proudly She Marches was produced in 35 mm for the theatrical market. Each film was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada. The NFB had an arrangement with Famous Players theatres to ensure that Canadians from coast-to-coast could see them, with further distribution by Columbia Pictures.Ellis and McLane 2005, p. 122. After the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16 mm to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two. They were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities. A total of 199 films were produced before the series was canceled in 1959.Ohayon, Albert. \\"Propaganda cinema at the NFB\\". National Film Board of Canada, July 13, 2009. Retrieved: February 9, 2016. Historian Malek Khouri analyzed the role of the NFB wartime documentaries with Women Are Warriors characterized as an example of a propaganda film. \\"During the early years of the NFB, its creative output was largely informed by the turbulent political and social climate the world was facing. World War II, Communism, unemployment, the role of labour unions, and working conditions were all subjects featured by the NFB during the period from 1939 to 1946\\".Khouri 2007, back cover. Khouri further stated: \\"As they made a case for the importance of women's contribution to the war industry, the message in NFB films such as 'Proudly She Marches' ... was that this work would be merely temporary. The film even hints that such line of activity (e.g., working in heavy industries or as military personnel) is 'unnatural' for women.\\"Khouri 2007, p. 137.

It follows his adventures after being sent for punishment on a ship and running into Japanese sailors. The film was released on November 20, 1942 by Famous Studios, a part of Paramount Studios and focuses on racist stereotypes of the Japanese during the war. These images were based on pre-existing images of the Japanese that the American people had in their minds from previous fears about immigration.Ngai, Mae M. (2014) Impossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 37 Because of the racism, this cartoon, along with some other World War II cartoons is now banned from being broadcast in most countries.Rowan, T. (2012) World War II Goes to the Movies & Television Guide. Lulu.com P 23.  Plot  Popeye has jumped out of a plane without a parachute, and as punishment he has to do a variety of chores to do to keep the ship clean. He uses the planes on the ships to clean it (e.g. tying mops to the propellers) and also paints camouflage onto the ship showing that he is trying to help the war effort. However, before he can get his jobs done a ‚Äòcloud‚Äô appears that begins to drop bombs onto the ship. At first Popeye is confused but then it is revealed that the ‚Äòcloud‚Äô is actually attached to a Japanese plane with the lettering ‚ÄòMade in Japan‚Äô written clearly on the back to make sure the audience knows who the enemy is. A Japanese soldier emerges depicted with thick glasses and big teeth to pander to contemporary racist stereotyping in America in an effort to demonise the enemy. Popeye uses terms like ‚ÄòJap‚Äô and ‚Äòstormtrooper‚Äô to describe the character and starts firing missiles at him from a plane while the stereotyped character frantically starts pedalling. Popeye manages to blow up the plane and the Japanese man is left holding a typical looking umbrella before falling onto a ‚ÄòJap Scrap Repair Ship‚Äô. All of the Japanese sailors on the ship look the same, reinforcing the idea of a Japanese unified mass especially when they all make a drilling sound to fix the plane. After falling from his plane, Popeye also lands on the ‚ÄòJap Scrap Repair Ship‚Äô and it begins to tip. All of the Japanese sailors start beating him but after eating his spinach, he throws his empty spinach can in the water to distract them and they all jump into the water. Because of eating his spinach, Popeye turns into the Statue of Liberty which was a familiar symbol in anti-Nazi cartoons as it is also used in Disney‚Äôs Der Fuehrer‚Äôs Face (1943). As Popeye thinks he is safe, a big Japanese battleship sends bombs his way. But this time he is prepared and rides the repair ship into it. He is able to easily fight off the Japanese sailors and when he throws them into the body of the ship their imprints make a ‚ÄòV‚Äô shape, perhaps showing Victory for the Allies. Popeye then uses a piece of railing from the ship to cut it up like a tin with a can opener before sitting back and eating an ice cream waiting for the ship to crumble. The cartoon ends with Popeye flying home with the Japanese sailors locked in a cage behind him, where they start complaining before they \\"turns\\" into rats and scurrying around.  Symbolism/themes  There are many symbols and themes that can be seen in this cartoon that were hoped to be picked up by American audiences. For example when Popeye shouts ‚ÄòI have never seen a Jap that wasn‚Äôt yeller‚Äô this was because the term yellow was rarely used to refer to the Japanese because this could also reflect badly on America‚Äôs Asian ally, China.Shull, M.S. & Wilt, D.E. (2004). Doing Their Bit: Wartime American Animated Short Films, 1939-1945 (2nd ed.). London: McFarland & Company, Inc. p129 Japan represented the ‚Äòyellow peril‚Äô and anti-Japanese prejudice was especially present on the West Coast of the United States. This culminated in severe restrictions on Asian immigration to America. The term ‚ÄòJap‚Äô that Popeye used throughout the cartoon was also used to help create the idea that the West were fighting a different species, while Germans and Italians were treated as individuals, the Japanese as a race were seen to possess a herd instinct that led to extreme loyalty to their emperor.Koppes, C.R. & Black, G.D. (2000). Hollywood Goes to War: Patriotism, Movies and the Second World War from Ninotchka to Mrs Miniver. London: Tauris Parke Paperbacks. P250 This can be seen on many occasions throughout the cartoon, for example when all of the sailors gathered round the plane to fix it they made a unified drilling sound. This was used by the American Government to help the American people to understand and be willing to fight the enemy as it is often easier when a group resembles an unidentified mass rather than individual civilians. Patriotism can be seen in the cartoon when Popeye briefly resembles the Statue of Liberty as this was often used as a symbol to represent American freedom and liberty. Similarly, at the end of the cartoon when all of the Japanese were locked in the cage they resembled squealing mice which could represent their naturally higher pitched voices. The weakness of Japanese equipment and ships is also represented when Popeye is able to use part of the railing like a tin opener to destroy the battleship. The cloud that the Japanese sailor was hidden behind could also represent how good the Japanese were at camouflaging themselves especially when they were in jungle environments. Similarly, it could be a symbol for their cunning and cowardice, attacking from a cover. It could also reference the surprise attack on Pearl Harbour as it could be argued they used there cunning there as well. Other terms that were used such as ‚Äòstorm trooper‚Äô also show the link between Germany and Japan. However, many anti-Nazi cartoons featuring Popeye didn‚Äôt really generate much suspense as everyone knew that the great Popeye would eventually triumph over the enemy. But it must be remembered that ‚Äòthis is a typical World War II propaganda cartoon with an ending that‚Äôs unpleasant and disturbing when viewed with today‚Äôs sensibilities.‚ÄôBierly, S.R. (2015). Stronger than Spinach: The Secret Appeal of the Famous Studios Popeye Cartoons. Georgia: BearManor Media. P1  Similar cartoons  There are many similar cartoons that feature anti-Japanese stereotypes. The most similar is You're a Sap, Mr. Jap (1942) in which Popeye spots a broken down fishing boat. When he goes on board, two foreign sailors hand him a false peace treaty which Popeye tries to sign (perhaps showing the willingness of the American people to stop war) before they hit him over the head with a mallet. They then try to give him a bouquet of flowers as an apology but it has an angry lobster inside. The broken down ship is eventually revealed to be disguising a huge destroyer and sinks Popeye‚Äôs ship. He eventually turns his bicep into a V for victory and destroys the ship. This again shows that Japanese ships were seen to be made very poorly. Japanese stereotypes also appear in Spies (1943), part of the Private SNAFU cartoon series. The film is about how enemy spies could be anywhere and that you can‚Äôt trust anyone. The film starts with Private SNAFU walking down the street and he is adamant that he is going to keep a secret. As he walks through town, there are spies hiding in various places such as in a post box, a phone box and a pram but he is oblivious to them. The spies shown are racist depictions of the Japanese with big teeth and thick glasses. Eventually, little by little, Private SNAFU starts to reveal information to various characters he meets including a stereotypical looking German women at a bar. This may have been shown to American soldiers to show how easy it can be to let out secrets especially when under the influence of alcohol. Commando Duck (1944) focuses on cementing anti-Japanese stereotypes while using the character of Donald Duck. The film begins with Donald parachuting into a remote jungle environment with the aim of destroying a Japanese airfield. After landing, he goes down a river on a small boat but is spotted by Japanese soldiers from the Imperial Japanese Army and they start firing at him. They are also shown firing the first shot at Donald‚Äôs back perhaps hinting at their cowardice. They are disguised as rocks and trees but still have racist Japanese features of big teeth and slanted eyes. However, Donald doesn‚Äôt realise that the soldiers are firing at him and he carries on down the river. After a while he gets stuck under a waterfall and his boat starts filling with water. Donald sees the Japanese airfield below when he is near the edge of the cliff and because it is so full of water it explodes sending all of the water onto the airfield.  Anti-Japanese propaganda  The American Government carried out an intensive effort to mould the content of films made during the war. Officials of the Office of War Information (OWI), the propaganda agency, were constantly updating and releasing manuals telling all animation studios how they could help in the war effort and reviewed screenplays of every major studio.Winkler, A. (1978) The Politics of Propaganda: Office of War Information, 1942-1945. The Review of Politics (Yale University Press) p406 American propaganda portrayed the Japanese as the worst kind of enemies during the war. The temptation to use racial terms to describe the Japanese in these films was overwhelming as the US already had a history of anti-Japanese prejudice that was based on Japanese samurai traditions.Dower, J.W. (1987) War Without Mercy: Race & Power in the Pacific War. Pantheon. p20 This portrayed them as fanatic and ruthless with a desire for overseas conquest without seeing the consequences and this was reinforced when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941 and many studios‚Äô first impulse was to capitalize on the theme of treachery and brutality. Propaganda was used with considerable effectiveness because the outcome of the attack was enormous and couldn‚Äôt be easily forgotten.Rhodes, A. (1976) Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II. Chelsea House Publishers, New York p257 Cartoons with Japanese stereotypes made little effort to develop a Japanese character or explain what Japan hoped to accomplish from the war, they remained nameless. The Japanese enemies were freakish stereotypes but were more often showcased as idiots rather than actual threats, this may have been done to dehumanize them as this would make it easier for the American people to hate and kill them. When the Bureau of Motion Pictures heard of these portrayals of the Japanese they were not pleased and decided to get all studios to shift from the theme of racism to one of fascism. Of course, however, the US Government issued statements that the enemy was not the German, Italian or Japanese themselves but it was their leadership that America should despise.Kanfer, S. (2008). Somebody: The Reckless Life and Remarkable Career of Marlon Brando. London: Faber and Faber Limited. P24 This went unnoticed as even Japanese Americans were being rounded up and put into internment camps in Washington, Oregon and California as it was thought they could join the enemy at any time, or commit acts of sabotage or espionage. An article in Time magazine even suggested how the American people could tell the difference between Asian people saying ‚Äòthe Japanese walk stiffly erect, hard heeled‚Äô while the Chinese were more relaxed and had an ‚Äòeasy gait‚Äô. These factors reinforced the idea that the Japanese were a unified mass even if some of them lived in America. By 1944, a poll suggested that 13% of Americans wanted to kill all the Japanese population and by 1945, 22% were disappointed that more atomic bombs were not used on the Japanese after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This shows that years of anti-Japanese propaganda and racial prejudices was starting to have an effect on the American population.

The most numerous single category of inscriptions are the manumission inscriptions, which reach roughly a number of 1300. Acts of manumission Manumission was called the action of liberation of a slave in antiquity. Slaves belonged to their masters until they served long enough or until they gathered the necessary sum of money for their liberation. When that moment came, the act of manumission had to be guaranteed by a god, most commonly Apollo. The slave was thus fictitiously sold to the deity, so that the sale action could never be violated. The act was recorded on inscriptions with a rather formulaic expression. The majority of the manumission inscriptions of Delphi are gathered in two main spots: on the supporting wall of the parodoi of the theatre and on the polygonal wall, particularly the part which served as back wall to the portico of the Athenians. Most of the inscriptions date between 200 B.C. and 100 A.D.Source: http://www.attalus.org/docs/other/inscr_24.html Manumission inscriptions as a source of information Despite their stylized expressions, these inscriptions offer an insights into Greek social and demographic history. Over 60% of the manumission inscriptions of Delphi concern female slaves. A comparison of prices proves that most female slaves were manumitted at a price roughly 20% lower than men. However, it seems that liberation in many cases was not complete: slaves are required under a paramone clause to stay with their ex masters for a specific period of time or until the latter passed away. One wonders what kind of freedom this was, but it seems that in some cases this was considered better than nothing, as the master did not have complete rights of life and death over them; furthermore, there were cases in which the slaves had become almost members of the family, so they did not want to be separated from their social environment, yet they would rather have the choice. The manumission acts were usually attended by witnesses, whose names are also mentioned on the inscription. The other people mentioned are the priests of the temple of Apollo and thus manumission inscriptions constitute an excellent source for tracing the succession lists of the priesthood of Delphi. The formula of a manumission inscription A typical manumission inscription is that of the female slave Meda:Regions (IG VII-IX) Delphi SGDI II 1708, Phokis ‚Äî Delphi ‚Äî 170-157/56 BC 1 ·ºÑœÅœáŒø[ŒΩœÑŒøœÇ ·ºàŒºœÜŒπ]œÉœÑ[œÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÖ] ŒºŒ∑ŒΩ·Ω∏œÇ [‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî] Œ∫ŒøœÖ, ·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ œÑŒø·øñœÉ[Œ¥Œµ ·ºÄœÄŒ≠Œ¥]Œø[œÑ]Œø Œ§Œπ- Œº·Ωº Œï·ΩêŒ¥ŒØŒ∫ŒøœÖ, œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÄŒ±ŒπŒΩŒ≠ŒøŒΩœÑŒøœÇ 5 œÑŒø·ø¶ œÖ·º±Œø·ø¶ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·æ∂œÇ ŒõŒ±Œ¥ŒØŒ∫ŒøœÖ, œÉ·ø∂ŒºŒ± Œ≥œÖ- ŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ∫Œµ·øñŒøŒΩ Œ∫ŒøœÅŒ¨œÉŒπŒøŒΩ ·ºáŒπ ·ΩÑŒΩŒøŒºŒ± ŒúŒÆŒ¥Œ±, œÑŒπŒº·æ∂œÇ ·ºÄœÅŒ≥œÖœÅŒØŒøœÖ Œ¥œçŒø ŒºŒΩ·æ∂ŒΩ, Œ∫Œ±Œ∏·ΩºœÇ ·ºêœÄŒØ- œÉœÑŒµœÖœÉŒµ ŒúŒÆŒ¥Œ± œÑ·ø∂Œπ Œ∏Œµ·ø∂Œπ œÑ·Ω∞ŒΩ ·Ω†ŒΩŒ¨ŒΩ, ·ºêœÜ‚Äô ·ΩßŒπ- œÑŒµ ·ºêŒªŒµœÖŒ∏Œ≠œÅŒ± Œµ·º∂ŒºŒµŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÄŒΩŒ≠œÜŒ±œÄœÑŒøœÇ 10 ·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œÑ·Ω∏Œº œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒ± œáœÅœåŒΩŒøŒΩ, œÄŒøŒπŒø·ø¶- œÉŒ± ·ΩÖ Œ∫Œ± Œ∏Œ≠ŒªŒ∑Œπ.

It is interesting to notice that the slave is mentioned in all manumission inscriptions as \\" œÉ·ø∂ŒºŒ±\\" (body). Meda appears to be a young girl, who is manumitted at a price of two silver minas, i.e. at the lowest level. Her obligation is to take care of her parents until she becomes an adult; a possible explanation is that the parents paid for her manumission. Both parents appear to be slaves as well. A careful examination of the names and place of origin of those who liberated their slaves proves that the \\"trend\\" of liberating slaves in Delphi came with the advent of the Aetolians.Scott, M., 2014,Delphi: A History of the Center of the Ancient World, Oxford The majority of masters were of Aetolian origin at least in the first century. However, the trend soon spread and the next two largest categories are, naturally, Locrians and Phocians, who lived nearby.

Within this, he was known for his antipathy towards the existing trade union movement, taking one of the most hardline views of the party's \\"class against class\\" policy.Matthew Worley, Class Against Class: The Communist Party in Britain Between the Wars, pp.123-144 By the start of the 1930s, the movement was winding down, but Mahon was appointed as editor of its newspaper, The Worker.Matthew Worley, Class Against Class: The Communist Party in Britain Between the Wars, p.243 He served as the election agent for party leader Harry Pollitt's unsuccessful campaign in the 1930 Whitechapel and St Georges by-election, then in 1931 was appointed as the CPGB's representative to the Profintern.Matthew Worley, Class Against Class: The Communist Party in Britain Between the Wars, p.307 In this role, he visited Moscow,The Times House of Commons 1951, p.33 attending a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.Andrew Thorpe, The British Communist Party and Moscow, 1920-43, p.199 Meanwhile, matters came to a head over his political views after party theoretician Rajani Palme Dutt wrote in support of Mahon, but Pollitt was able to manoeuvre the party into dissolving the Minority Movement and refocusing on work in the existing trade unions.Andrew Thorpe, The British Communist Party and Moscow, 1920-43, pp.199-200 With the Minority Movement no longer in existence, Mahon found a role as Industrial Organiser for the London District of the CPGB. In 1937, he served as Political Commissar for the British Battalion in the Spanish Civil War, but soon returned to London. In 1947, he replaced Ted Bramley as District Secretary, and was also elected to the party's Executive Committee for the first time.Brian Pearce, \\"For the Twentieth Anniversary of Comrade Harry Pollitt as General Secretary of the Communist Party\\" He stood unsuccessfully for election on three occasions: in the 1949 St Pancras North by-election, in Battersea North at the 1950 general election, and in Lewisham South in 1951. Mahon retired from his party posts in 1966, and was replaced as District Secretary by Frank Stanley.David Aaronovitch, Party Animals: My Family and Other Communists, pp.148-149 He spent his retirement writing a biography of Pollitt, which was published in 1974, dying shortly afterwards.

He came from an important family, de magno sanguine natus (born from high blood), as his funeral monument states. He was learned in the law, \\"tu sapiens pectus iuris vexilla ferebas.\\"Vincenzo Forcella, Inscrizioni delle chiese ed altre edifici di Roma Vol. VIII (Roma 1876), p. 13 no. 11. He was Archdeacon of the Church of Milan.Filippo Angelico Becchetti, Della istoria ecclesiastica dell' eminentissimo cardinale Giuseppe Agostino Orsi, proseguita da f. F.A. Becchetti Tomo 15 (Roma 1783) p. 75. The Roman Curia He was brought to Rome where he became a papal Chaplain and, under Pope Nicholas III, served in the papal Chancery as Auditor sacri palatii (later termed Auditor of the Rota).Emmanuele Cerchiari, Cappellani papae et Auditores sacri palatii apostolici Volumen II (Roma 1920), p. 17. The Vice-Chancellor, the effective head of the papal Secretariat, and Comes' superior from 1276 to 1288 was Pietro Peregrosso of Milan, and it is not an unreasonable conjecture that he was the original patron of Comes de Casate. He was one of the officials, along with Pietro Peregrosso, who were charged by Nicholas III in 1279 with producing the finished version of Exiit qui seminat, the papal Bull which granted a favorable constitution to the Franciscan Order.Lucas Wadding, Annales Minorum (second ed. by J. M. Fonseca) Vol. V (Rome 1733), p. 73-74. Cardinalate Comes de Casato was named a cardinal-priest by Pope Martin IV in the Consistory of 12 April 1281 and assigned the titular church of SS. Pietro e Marcellino in Rome.Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi, I, editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p. 10. He was appointed an ecclesiastical examiner of canonical validity and personal worthiness by Pope Martin in the final stages of the long-running case of the election of an Abbot of the monastery of S. Benedetto de Padolirone in the diocese of Mantua. Although the bull had been signed on 14 January 1285 it had not yet received the bulla (lead seal) when Pope Martin died on 28 March 1285, and had to wait for Pope Honorius IV to order his seal to be affixed.Maurice Prou, Les Registres d' Honorius IV (Paris 1888), pp. 11-14, no. 7 (5 April 1285). He was also appointed the Auditor (judge) in the case of the double election of a bishop of Nevers. The two candidates were persuaded to spontaneously and freely resign their elections into the hands of the Pope. The matter of the vacancy in the bishopric came to Honorius IV after the death of Martin IV, and he appointed his chaplain, Egidius de Castelleto.Maurice Prou, Les Registres d' Honorius IV (Paris 1888), p. 62, no. 71 (23 July 1285). Cardinal Comes de Casate was also appointed Auditor by Pope Martin IV in a lawsuit over the income of a prebend in the Cathedral of Paris between one of the Canons and the Monastery of S. Victor; he finally issued a judgment on 31 August 1285, and Pope Honorius IV finally confirmed it on 22 October. It took another mandate from the Pope, however, to get the verdict obeyed.Maurice Prou, Les Registres d' Honorius IV (Paris 1888), pp. 150-159, no. 202; p. 598, no. 855 (22 October 1285). Cardinal Comes was also appointed, on 31 July 1285, to serve as Auditor in the dispute between the Bishop of Poitiers and the monastery of Aureevallis.Maurice Prou, Les Registres d' Honorius IV (Paris 1888), pp. 113-115, no. 139. He had also been appointed that Summer to examine the election of a new Abbot of Monte Cassino, Thomas the Dean of the monastery, which was approved on his recommendation by Pope Honorius on 28 September 1285.Maurice Prou, Les Registres d' Honorius IV (Paris 1888), pp. 115-116, no. 140. Cardinal Comes was one of fourteen cardinals who were present in Consistory on 17 September 1285, when the \\"Constitution for the Organization of the Kingdom of Sicily\\" was promulgated. This document was made necessary by the disastrous events which had ruined the control of the Roman Church over the island of Sicily and loosened its grip on southern Italy. King Charles I of Anjou had suffered disastrous losses in the rising called the Sicilian Vespers in the Spring of 1282; he had died on 7 January 1285, with Sicily in the hands of Peter III of Aragon. The entire island of Sicily had been excommunicated and laid under interdict by Pope Martin IV, ever the compliant friend and abettor of King Charles.Maurice Prou, Les Registres d' Honorius IV (Paris 1888), pp. 72-86, no. 96. Steven Runciman, The Sicilian Vespers (Cambridge 1958). But there is a certain unreality about the whole occasion of the issue of the Constitution. The Pope had no means at all to enforce his decrees, which had the form of an overlord dictating to a villain, and overlord who had not fulfilled his feudal duties to his vassals. Martin IV had been a major part of the Sicilian problem, and Honorius IV's response provided rhetoric, but no solution to the Church's problems. Reign of Pope Honorius IV (1285-1287) At the end of 1285 Cardinal Comes was again appointed Examiner of Bishops in the case of the Bishop of Utica (Uz√®s) in Aquitaine, which was approved by Pope Honorius on 4 January 1286.Maurice Prou, Les Registres d' Honorius IV (Paris 1888), p. 187, no. 238.

It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens to commemorate employees of the North Eastern Railway (NER) who left to fight in the First World War and were killed while serving. The NER board voted in early 1920 to allocate ¬£20,000 for a memorial and commissioned Lutyens. The committee for the York City War Memorial followed suit and also appointed Lutyens, but both schemes became embroiled in controversy. Concerns were raised from within the community about the effect of the NER memorial on the city walls and its impact on the proposed scheme for the city's war memorial, given that the two memorials were planned to be apart and the city's budget was a tenth of the NER's. The controversy was resolved after Lutyens modified his plans for the NER memorial to move it away from the walls and the city opted for a revised scheme on land just outside the walls; coincidentally the land was owned by the NER, whose board donated it to the city. The NER memorial was unveiled on 14 June 1924 by Field Marshal Lord Plumer. It consists of a high obelisk which rises from the rear portion of a three-sided screen wall. The wall forms a recess in which stands Lutyens' characteristic Stone of Remembrance. The wall itself is decorated with several carved swags and wreaths, including a wreath surrounding the NER's coat of arms at the base of the obelisk. The memorial is a grade II* listed building, and is part of a \\"national collection\\" of Lutyens' war memorials. Background The North Eastern Railway (NER), one of the largest employers in the north of England, released over 18,000 of its employees to serve in the armed forces during the First World War, many of them joining the 17th (North Eastern Railway) Battalion of the Northumberland Fusiliers. By the end of the war, 2,236 men from the company had died on military service overseas; others were killed at home by bombardments of east coast ports, such as the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, and in the three Zeppelin raids on York.Langham, pp. 119‚Äì121.Biddle, p. 467. After the war, thousands of memorials were built across Britain. Among the most prominent designers of memorials was architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed The Cenotaph in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens' war memorials in Britain, including the North Eastern Railway's.Skelton, p. 139. The war memorial is one of several buildings and structures in the centre of York related to the NER, including the company's headquarters and the city's original railway station. The site‚Äîchosen as being immediately adjacent to the company's head office‚Äîwas originally a coal depot and carriage sidings.Burnham, pp. 100‚Äì102. Inception The memorial viewed from Station Road with the city walls in the background; the memorial was originally to abut the wall but the design had to be modified after it proved controversial. At a meeting in April 1919, the NER's board discussed the idea of a war memorial, and decided that it should be of \\"an ornamental, rather than of a utilitarian character\\".Lambert, pp. 181‚Äì182. The board initially planned to seek donations for the project from it workforce, but changed its mind after the general manager reported that the idea met with widespread disapproval among employees. It then formed a subcommittee to consider possible designs and propose a suitable budget. At the company's annual general meeting in February 1920, a resolution was passed allocating a budget of ¬£20,000 for the designing and building of a memorial. The board commissioned Lutyens, which was confirmed in October 1921, for a fee of ¬£700 plus travel and out-of-pocket expenses. The NER's deputy general manager explained that Lutyens had been chosen because he was \\"the fashionable architect and therefore could do no wrong\\".Skelton, p. 59. The project became embroiled in a controversy surrounding its size and location, which grew to envelop the proposed York City War Memorial. Following the railway company's lead, the City War Memorial Committee also appointed Lutyens, and endorsed his plan for a Stone of Remembrance elevated on a large plinth in the moat by Lendal Bridge, from the proposed site of the NER's memorial. The controversy revolved partly around the relationship between the two memorials‚ÄîLutyens felt that the two designs would complement one another, but the city had given Lutyens a budget of ¬£2,000, a tenth of that allocated to him by the NER, and some members of the local community were concerned that the railway company's memorial would be much larger and would overshadow the city's. Another concern, raised by a city councillor, was that visitors walking into the city centre from the railway station would see the NER's memorial first. Lutyens responded that he felt the two memorials would show a common purpose, and thus that their proximity was not an issue. The issue was further complicated by the proximity of both proposed schemes to York's ancient city walls; both schemes required the consent of the Ancient Monuments Board (later English Heritage and now Historic England), particularly as Lutyens' design for the NER involved the memorial abutting the city walls and would have required excavation of part of the ramparts, to which the Yorkshire Architectural and York Archaeological Society (YAYAS) strenuously objected. The NER's in-house architect suggested moving the memorial to the east, away from the wall; Lutyens, in India at the time, dismissed the idea in a cable.Skelton, pp. 59‚Äì60. In February 1922, the secretary of the YAYAS, Dr William Evelyn, gave a lecture in which he was severely critical of the NER's proposed memorial. He told his audience \\"I think it is an enormous pity that they cannot find room in which to place a sacred emblem commemorative of the patriotism, bravery, and self-sacrifice of our own soldiers of the twentieth century and that it should be considered necessary to deface and despoil another sacred emblem\\".Skelton, p. 60. The City War Memorial Committee and representatives of the NER met with Charles Reed Peers, the Ancient Monuments Board's chief inspector, at the NER's offices on 8 July 1922, in preparation for which the NER erected a full-size wooden model of their proposed memorial. Peers approved the city's scheme, noting that its proposed location was in fact a newer structure and not part of the walls' ramparts, but requested that Lutyens submit a revised design for the NER's memorial to move it away from the wall. Lutyens acquiesced but observed that the modifications would require a reduction in the size of the screen wall and thus in the size of the names to be listed on it, which he felt was detrimental to the scheme. He submitted the revised designs and they were approved in October 1922.Skelton, p. 61. The remaining issues were largely resolved after the city relented to public pressure and opted to site its memorial on a plot of land off Leeman Road, just outside the city walls, and for a reduced scheme in the form of a cross due to a shortage of funds. Coincidentally, the land was owned by the railway company and the NER board donated it to the city in a mark of gratitude for the good relations between the company and the city; the NER had by that time been amalgamated into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) as a result of the Railways Act 1921. Design Close-up of the Stone of Remembrance on its own platform set forward from the screen wall; Lutyens designed the stone for the Imperial (later Commonwealth) War Graves commission, but it also features in several of his war memorials. Built from Portland stone, the memorial is sited against the ramparts of the city walls. It consists of a single, obelisk rising from a three-tiered pedestal set into the rear portion of a three-sided screen wall. The wall creates a recess, sheltering a Stone of Remembrance. The two flanking sides terminate with urn-shaped finials; the ends of each wall are decorated with a laurel wreath in relief carving; the inside of the walls is further decorated with laurel swags below the urns. The rear wall bears further relief swags to either side of the obelisk; the North Eastern Railway Company's coat of arms is engraved on the pedestal of the obelisk, just above the level of the screen wall, which is surrounded by another laurel wreath.

The dedication is inscribed in the centre of the rear part of the screen wall: \\"IN REMEMBRANCE OF THOSE MEN OF THE NORTH EASTERN RAILWAY WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY THE COMPANY PLACES THIS MONUMENT\\"; the dates of the First World War are inscribed to either side. The 2,236 names were inscribed on panels affixed to the wall.

The NER's former headquarters is to the right and York's city walls are to the left; York Minster is visible in the background. The North Eastern Railway War Memorial was finally constructed once the ancient Monuments Board approved Lutyens' modified design; it was unveiled by Field Marshal Herbert Plumer, 1st Baron Plumer (later 1st Viscount Plumer) at a ceremony on 14 June 1924, and dedicated by the Archbishop of York Cosmo Gordon Lang.North Eastern Railway Memorial, Imperial War Museums A crowd of five to six thousand people gathered for the ceremony, among them multiple civic officials and officers of the LNER and former NER, including Sir Ralph Wedgwood, chief officer of the LNER; the Sheriff of York; and the lord mayors of Bradford, Hull, and York. Sentries from the Durham Light Infantry stood at the four corners of the Stone of Remembrance.Langham, p. 121. Among those to give speeches was Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, a member of the NER's board and the former foreign secretary famous for his remark \\"the lamps are going out\\". Grey spoke of the losses caused by the war: \\"the old North Eastern board and its general manager numbered some twenty persons. Out of those twenty, four lost sons in the war; three lost only sons. There is no reason to suppose that proportion is exceptional\\". At the conclusion of the service, the \\"Last Post\\" was sounded and the crowd observed two minutes' silence. The city's war memorial was unveiled a year later. The inscriptions, particularly the names of those killed, suffered from exposure to the elements. Restoration work, including re-carving, was carried out in the 1980s, funded by donations from the British Railways Engineers Ex-Servicemen's Association match-funded by British Rail. Erosion continued in the years following and in lieu of re-carving them and causing further damage to the memorial, the names were recorded in a book which is held by the National Railway Museum.Boorman, pp. 29‚Äì30. The memorial was designated a grade II* listed building (a status which offers statutory protection from demolition or modification, defined as \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\" and applied to about 5.5% of listed buildings) on 10 September 1970. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a national collection and all 44 of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England entries updated and expanded. As part of this process, the York City memorial was upgraded to grade II* to match the NER's memorial.

In its history the company has re-elaborated myths from Sumer, Greece and the pre- Hispanic tradition in America from a contemporary perspective in theatrical spectacles. The productions are ecologically conscious and include social criticism and the use of traditional stories pertaining to the communities where the spectacles are performed. From 1973 till 1998, Dragon Dance Theatre presented its own original works annually at the Bread and Puppet Theatre's Domestic Resurrection Circus. The shows featured Tomas Luna, Roberto Villase√±or, Ignacio Miranda, Ricardo Flores, Jerome Lipani and musically, Dan Roth, Susan Bettmann, Jairo Siqueiros, Dennis Darah, among others.

In 1973 Sam Kerson and Norman Briski, the notorious Argentine director and actor, met in Cuzco, Peru, where Briski was in exile at the time. The encounter proved to be influential for the Dragon Dance Theatre, and Kerson and Briski have worked together in various projects, including the show Puzzles, which Briski directed. Kerson learned from Briski his technique of collective creation, which includes improvisation, dramatization and socialization of characters and ideas; all of which came from the social movements in Argentina.

The Dragon Dance Theatre had projects in Nicaragua during the last years of the Nicaraguan Revolution from 1987 to 1992. Those years had a considerable influence on the company. The company got involved in and produced political productions, such as Death and The General.Contra Lo Fatal, after a poem by Ruben Dario, directed by Sam Kerson, performed in Monimbo, Nicaragua, 1987. During the last two decades the company has produced works of collective creation with indigenous and mestizo communities in Mexico, especially in the states of Quer√©taro, Veracruz and Oaxaca, where the company staged, in close collaboration with the Mexican director Roberto Villase√±or, the series of productions Sol y Luna, a wide-ranging theater project that was presented on the archeological ruins of Monte Alban in Oaxaca, between the years 1994 and 1996.

Collective creation Since 1994, the company organizes the Pan- American Puppetry Arts Institute, artists‚Äô residencies with the participation and collaboration of international artists and the local community. These workshops include plastic arts, theater, giant masks making and painting, the art of narration, music and dance. The work of the company is based on collective creation. The spectacles are produced with and in the communities, with the local language and in common spaces. The topics usually come from a legend or a folkloric tale of the region where the project is realized, adapted to contemporary dilemmas. Late and current projects The Dragon Dance Theatre changed its base from Vermont, USA, to Quebec, Canada, in 2001. There the Quebec artist Katah joined the company and became director of international projects. In the last 15 years the company has produced several spectacles in Jalpan de Serra, in the Mexican state of Quer√©taro, with the support and collaboration of the Museo Historico de la Sierra Gorda and its director, Junipero Cabrera Berrones. The themes of the projects have ranged from the lives of Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera and Leon Trotsky; the fragility of the ecosystems under exploitation in Mexico; and the life and work of Junipero Serra and the indigenous resistance to Spanish colonialism in the Sierra Gorda area. In 2008 the company produced the movie El R√≠o de la Vida (The River of Life) in the indigenous Zapotec community of San Blas Atempa, in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, in Oaxaca. The story is embedded in the celebration of the Day of the Dead in Southern Mexico, and it‚Äôs an adaptation of La Tonka de Madera, a short story by the local artist Maira Jimenez Desales, who participated in the movie as a producer and leading actress. The documentalist Edson Caballero was in charge of recording and photography. In the last decade the Dragon Dance Theatre has organized three artist residencies in the north of Finland collaborating with Anna-Kaisa J√§rvi, who was the producer of the three events. The spectacles were adaptations of various Kalevala (the Finnish epic) poems and received coverage and positive reviews in the regional papers. The main theme of the productions was ecological and political awareness, the last one especially concerning nuclear power.

In 2012-14, the company also produced theater projects of collective creation in the Sierra de Otontepec, in the north of the Mexican state of Veracruz. Central to the productions have been themes of social conflict, the black population of the region, feminism and agriculture. The spectacles were co-produced by Arturo Tristan, a cultural promoter of the region.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the Caucasus mountains and Turkey. It forms dense clumps, with grey-green leaves, simple stems of similar height, with 1‚Äì3 branches, a flowers in various shades from white, yellow to purple. They also have yellowish or white, tipped yellow beard. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It is similar in form to a dwarf form of an Iris aphylla. It has partially exposed rhizomes, that branches to form a dense clump. It has falcate (sickle-shaped), grey-green leaves, deciduous, simple, sheathing leaves. They can grow up to long, and between 1.5 and 2.5 cm wide. The leaves are a similar height to the flowering stems, but broader than those of Iris schachtii. It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall, with 1‚Äì3 branches, (or pedicels). The stem (and branches) have inflated, green, spathes (or leaves of the flower bud). The stems (and the branches) hold 2 and rarely 5 flowers, in spring, between April, or between May and June. The large, flowers are in diameter, and come in shades from white, yellow to purple, including pale yellow, gold, brownish-red, reddish purple, blue, and violet. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. In the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which are yellow, or white, tipped with yellow, a few forms can have a purple beard. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule which has not been described. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. In 1989, a karyological study was carried out on 4 iris species in Turkey; including Iris junonia Schott et Kotschy ex Schott, Iris purpureobractea B. Matthew and T. Baytop, Iris taochia Woronow ex Grossh., and Iris schachtii. It found the chromosome counts of the various iris species, Iris taochia had a count of 2n=24. It was also re-counted in 1990, by ≈ûenel, G. & S. √ñzyurt. in Erzurum √ßevresinde yayilis7 g√∂steren Iridaceae familyasina ait bazi goefitler √ºzerinde karyolojik incelemeler. X. Ulusal Biyoloji Kongresi (18‚Äì20 Temmuz 1990, Erzurum) Botanik Bildirileri 1: 97 page102. It is often listed as 2n=24 Taxonomy It is sometimes known as Iris toochii, or Iris taochii. It is commonly known as 'Autum iris' or 'Tortum s√ºseni', 'Tortum Iris' in Turkish. The Latin specific epithet taochia refers to the Taochi people, who were a race of people from Anatolia in antiquity, known mainly from Greco-Roman ethnography. The Taochoi lived in a mountainous area of the Black Sea to the current borders of Georgia, Armenia and Turkey. In 1927, it was initially discovered by G. Woronoff, in Kars within Turkish Armenia. It was then described by Woronow in Correvon in 1927. It was then first fully published and described by Alexander Alfonsovich Grossheim in Fl. Kavkaza Vol.1 on page 256 in 1928. As its growth habit is very similar to Iris aphylla, it was once re-classified as Iris aphylla var. taochia Woronow ex Grossheim. But in 1989, it returned to being a separate species. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 11 December 2014. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, and in the Catalogue of Life. Iris taochia is a 'tentatively accepted name' by the RHS, and was last-listed in the RHS Plant Finder in 1998. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate regions of western Asia, and southeastern Europe. =Range= It is found in the Caucasus, and northeastern, Turkey, (near Erzurum, in the region of Anatolia). Native to upland basalts in the northeastern corner of Turkey around. =Habitat= It grows on the dry, rocky slopes, and volcanic screes. Consisting of basalt. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation It is listed as vulnerable in Black Sea region of Turkey. Cultivation It is hardy to ‚àí20 ¬∞C, meaning that it is hardy in hotter, drier parts of Europe and the USA. In the UK, apart from the southeast, it needs the protection of a bulb frame to form flowers, although needs plenty of water. It prefers to grow in well-drained soils, According to a soil analysis, carried out in 2006, the plant generally prefers sandy-argilloceous-loamy and loamy-sandy type of soil, with a medium alkaline or neutral, non-saline, calcareous in soils in regard of pH levels. It can tolerate slightly alkaline soils and rich soils in respect of organic matter and nitrogen. It prefers positions in full sun, similar to the conditions of Iris germanica. It is in cultivation, meaning it is found in specialist bulb nurseries. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. =Hybrids and cultivars= It is thought, that the species could be used in plant breeding programmes, to form small 'medium tall bearded' iris cultivars with more branching, but this is very similar to many other iris species. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske References Sources * Davis, P. H., ed.

Although they were once a widespread and diverse group of primates, the Pliopithecoids have no living descendants.  History of discovery  The first fossil specimens attributed to Pliopithecoidea were discovered by √âdouard Lartet in Sansan, France in 1837. These fossils were later referenced by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1839, who named the type species Pliopithecus antiquus. A second species, Pliopithecus platyodon, was discovered in Switzerland by Biedermann in 1863. Following this, a small number of other pliopithecoid species were described from fossil collections found in France, Germany, and Poland. In the mid-twentieth century, paleontologists Johannes H√ºrzeler and Helmuth Zapfe reinvigorated interest in the pliopithecoids with a series of publications in which they named a number of new species, including Pliopithecus vindobonensis, which consists of the most complete cranial and post-cranial pliopithecoid specimens ever discovered. Based on their size, and some superficial similarities to modern day gibbons, Zapfe suggested that pliopithecoids were ancestral to the Hylobatidae lineage. With the discovery of more European pliopithecoid fossils in the mid to late 1970s, and subsequent discovery of pliopithecoid fossils in China, the idea that pliopithecoids were ancestral to gibbons fell out of favor. Today, most paleontologists agree that pliopithecoids hold a basal position in the catarrhine family tree. As such, pliopithecoids represent something similar to the common ancestor of Old World monkeys and apes. A femur discovered in Eppelsheim and given the Genus name Paidopithex was for many years controversial, as its large size compared to Pliopithecoids led to suggestions that it was instead related to the Dryopithecini. A lack of femurs for Dryopithecini meant that the suggestion was not ruled out for many years, but in 2002 work by K√∂hler et al comparing it to a recently discovered Dryopithecus laietanus skeleton showed that it was very different from the Dryopithecini. However, K√∂hler felt unable to definitely place Paidopithex in the Pliopithecoid superfamily, stating it was either an unusually large Pliopithecoid (estimated bodyweight 22 kg) or could be the sole known species of a separate superfamily. A worn tooth found near Haritalyangar in India and dated from around 9 to 8 million years ago has been suggested as possibly a Pliopithecoid species, Krishnapithecus krishnai, but the wear has made this difficult to determine. However, two recently discovered molars in the same area appear to support this, with placement within the superfamily uncertain (but clearly not Crouzeliinae)  Physical characteristics  The pliopithecoid fossil record mostly consists of teeth with a few mandibular and maxillary fragments. The dental formula (2.1.2.3) and shape of the teeth are the primary factors which include pliopithecoids among the catarrhini. Although some authors have argued that the narrow upper molars and broad upper molars of pliopithecoids demonstrate their affinity with modern catarrhines, others have demonstrated that these traits are variable between species. In fact, pliopithecoids are more similar to New World monkeys in some aspects of their dentition, including narrow lower incisors (mesiodistally waisted towards the base of the crown). Many species have what is often referred to as a 'pliopithecine triangle', a subtle set of ridges defining a small triangular shaped pit between the protocone and hypocone of the lower molars, but even this trait is variable. Instead, the most defining dental trait present in all pliopithecoids is a tall crowned lower third premolar, which is relatively triangular in outline with a comparatively short, vertically oriented mesiobucal face. The crania of P. vindobonesis, Laccopithecus robustus, Pliopithecus zhanxiangi, and Anapithecus hernyaki demonstrate that pliopithecoids had relatively large and globular braincases with a projecting snout. The snout projects less than the propliopithecoids of North Africa (i.e. Aegyptopithecus), suggesting some prognathic reduction from the inferred common ancestor of these two primate families. The orbits are widely spaced and the mandible is long and robust, with a relatively broad ramus. Most importantly, however, pliopithecoids had an incompletely ossified ectotympanic tube. This anatomical feature represents an intermediate stage between what is found in platyrrhines, which do not have an ossified ectotympanic tube, and catarrhines, which have a completely ossified ectotympanic tube. Nearly all of what is known about the body proportions and post-cranial morphology of this family are derived from Pliopithecus vindobonensis, as it is the only species for which a complete skeleton has been found. Still, the majority of fossil material indicates that pliopithecoids were medium sized primates, approximately the size of a howler monkey or a gibbon (8 kg). K√∂hler estimates a slightly higher average weight of 10 kg. Post-cranially, pliopithecoids had an interesting mix of platyrrhine and catarrhine traits. The brachial index of P. vindobonesis (the length of the radius divided by the length of the humerus) is similar to that of a howler monkey, but the crural index (the length of the tibia divided by the length of the femur) is similar to that of a gibbon. Proportionally, however, the forelimbs of P. vindobonesis were shorter than their hindlimbs, making them comparable to a baboon. The hands and feet of P. vindobonesis were long and curved, suggesting that pliopithecoids were adept and agile climbers. The post-crania of P. vindobonesis also shows that Pliopithecoids had an entepicondylar foramen, which is a primitive trait not found in any other catarrhine primates (extant or extinct). The wrist and hands of pliopithecoids were seemingly much more similar to platyrrhines than to catarrhines, as the carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb is a modified ‚Äúhinge joint‚Äù compared to the \\"saddle-like\\" thumb joint found in Old World monkeys and apes. Pliopithecoids also had a tail.

It was founded in 1990 by Nigel Oakes, who served as its CEO. SCL began targeting elections in developing countries in the early 1990s, and has engaged in psychological warfare in military contexts as a contractor for the American and British militaries during the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War. In 2013 it established the subsidiary Cambridge Analytica that helped Leave.EU with its Brexit campaign and worked on Ted Cruz and Donald Trump campaigns during the 2016 US presidential election. It performed data mining and data analysis on its audience. Based on results, communications would then be specifically targeted to key audience groups to modify behaviour in accordance with the goal of SCL's client. The company described itself as a \\"global election management agency\\". The company's leaders and owners had close ties to the Conservative Party (UK), the British royal family and the British military, and its investors included some of the largest donors to the Conservative Party. History In 1990, Nigel Oakes, who had a background in TV production and advertising, founded the Behavioural Dynamics Institute (BDI) as a research facility for strategic communication. The study of mass behaviour and how to change it led him to establish Strategic Communication Laboratories in 1993. Oakes thought that to shift mass opinion, academic insights as gained through psychologists and anthropologists at BDI should be applied, and would be more successful than traditional advertising methods. BDI became a non-profit affiliate of SCL. Among the investors in SCL were banker Paul David Ashburner Nix, whose son Alexander Nix was to become a close associate of Oakes. One of the former directors is Lord Ivar Mountbatten. Among the investors in the company were Jonathan Marland, Baron Marland and Roger Gabb, a major Conservative Party donor who was registered as having significant control over the company as of 2018. Activities After an initial commercial success, SCL expanded into military and political arenas. It became known for alleged involvement \\"in military disinformation campaigns to social media branding and voter targeting\\". In 2005, \\"with a glitzy exhibit\\" at Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI), \\"the United Kingdom's largest showcase for military technology\\", SCL demonstrated its capacity in \\"influence operations\\": \\"to help orchestrate a sophisticated campaign of mass deception\\" on the public of a big city like London. According to its website, SCL has participated in over 25 international political and electoral campaigns since 1994. SCL's involvement in the political world has been primarily in the developing world where it has been used by the military and politicians to study and manipulate public opinion and political will. It uses what have been called \\"psy ops\\" to provide insight into the thinking of the target audience. SCL claimed to be able to help foment coups. According to its website, SCL has influenced elections in Italy, Latvia, Ukraine, Albania, Romania, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Mauritius, India, Indonesia, The Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, Colombia, Antigua, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, St. Kitts & Nevis, and Trinidad & Tobago. While the company initially got involved in elections in the United Kingdom, it ceased to do so after 1997 because staff members did not exhibit the same \\"aloof sensibility\\" as with projects abroad. SCL claims that its methodology has been approved or endorsed by agencies of the Government of the United Kingdom and the Federal government of the United States, among others. =Cambridge Analytica= SCL formed Cambridge Analytica to participate in the election process in the United States. It entered the U.S. market in 2012, and was involved in 44 U.S. congressional, US Senate and state-level elections in the 2014 midterm elections. In 2015 it was disclosed that the company had entered the Republican Party presidential primaries for the 2016 election, primarily in support of Ted Cruz. CA is heavily funded by hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, a major supporter of Cruz and then Donald Trump, and is now under investigation by both the UK and the US governments. The company has since been disbanded and was bought by Emerdata Limited. =Emerdata Limited= Emerdata Limited was established in August 2017, by many of the people involved in Cambridge Analytica. Emerdata was established in 2017 by the chief data officer and chairman of Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL Group, which closed operations on 1 May 2018. Its headquarters in London is in the same building as Cambridge Analytica. The company was noted as appearing to offer similar services as SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica. Emerdata's board of directors included Frontier Services Group officer , a Hong Kong businessman linked to Erik Prince (founder of Blackwater), Cambridge Analytica investor Rebekah Mercer, and Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix. In January 2018, Emerdata reportedly raised $19 million from international investors. Emerdata was widely discussed in the news media. It was portrayed as a potential successor to Cambridge Analytica. In May 2018, Nigel Oakes, founder of the SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica's British affiliate, acknowledged that Emerdata's intent had been to acquire Cambridge Analytica and SCL, but said that these plans had been abandoned and that Emerdata and its partly-owned subsidiary Firecrest Technologies Ltd., which had been set up by former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, would be wound down. In July 2019, it was revealed that Emerdata \\"fully acquired\\" those companies, \\"has been footing the SCL companies' legal bills amid bankruptcy proceedings, investigations, and lawsuits on both sides of the Atlantic\\", and \\"also paid millions to acquire what remained of the companies while they [were] being liquidated\\". =Board of directors= As of March 2018, the company had four directors: Roger Michael Gabb, Alexander Nix, Nigel John Oakes and Julian David Wheatland. The company was first incorporated at Companies House on 20 July 2005 as Strategic Communication Laboratories Limited, using the shell company registrar SDG Registrars Limited which has acted on behalf of nearly 4,500 companies. The latest director is Jacquelyn James-Varga who has previously worked at the Mercer Family Foundation. Closure announcement On 1 May 2018, SCL Group stated that it would be closing operations because of the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal. However, its website and staff continued to operate but have subsequently shut down. SCL group is owned by its parent company SCL Elections. =FTC investigation= In 2019 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an administrative complaint against Cambridge Analytica for misuse of data, while filing settlements with its former CEO Alexander Nix and app developer Aleksandr Kogan in which they agreed to delete illegally obtained data; the case against the company itself is still ongoing. =Disqualification of Alexander Nix= In 2020 Alexander Nix signed a disqualification undertaking, accepted by the UK Secretary of State on 14 September 2020. The Insolvency Service commented that \\"Within the undertaking, Alexander Nix did not dispute that he caused or permitted SCL Elections Ltd or associated companies to market themselves as offering potentially unethical services to prospective clients; demonstrating a lack of commercial probity.\\" Effective from 5 October 2020, Alexander Nix is disqualified for seven years from acting as a director or directly or indirectly becoming involved, without the permission of the court, in the promotion, formation or management of a UK company.

Both systems are used to sort patients into categories at mass casualty incidents (MCIs). However, JumpSTART was designed specifically for triaging children in disaster settings. Though JumpSTART was developed for use in children from infancy to age 8, where age is not immediately obvious, it is used in any patient who appears to be a child (patients who appear to be young adults are triaged using START). JumpSTART was created in 1995 by Dr. Lou Romig, a pediatric emergency and disaster physician working at Miami Children's Hospital. After seeing the effects of Hurricane Andrew on the pediatric population, Dr. Romig became interested in pediatric disaster medicine and developed the JumpSTART tool. JumpSTART was modified in 2001. Triage categories Like START, JumpSTART sorts patients into four categories: ': Life-threatening injury; needs medical attention within the next hour ': Non-life-threatening injuries; needs medical attention, but treatment can be delayed a few hours ': Minor injuries; may need medical attention in the next few days (\\"the walking wounded\\") ': Deceased, or injuries so severe that life-saving treatment cannot be provided with the resources available The JumpSTART algorithm =Step 1: Identify ambulatory patients= As with START, the triage clinician begins by instructing everyone who can walk to move to a designated area for treatment. All patients who are able to do this are immediately tagged green (minor). These patients are then fully triaged by a clinician assigned to the green area (secondary triage). In the JumpStart system, infants are evaluated first in secondary triage, using the entire JumpStart algorithm. Other children who did not walk on their own, but were carried to the treatment area, are evaluated next. =Step 2: Is the patient breathing?= Yes If the patient is breathing, the clinician proceeds to step 3. No As with START, an airway maneuver is first attempted. If the child starts breathing on their own, they are triaged red (immediate). However, unlike START, patients who do not have a spontaneous return of respirations following an airway maneuver are not immediately triaged Black. First the clinician feels for a peripheral pulse. If the child is apneic with no peripheral pulse, they are triaged black (deceased/expectant). If the child does have a palpable peripheral pulse, the clinician delivers five assisted ventilations. If the child remains apneic, they are triaged black. If the child has a return of spontaneous respirations, they are triaged red. =Step 3: Assess respiratory rate, perfusion, and mental status= The child is triaged red if: * Their respiratory rate is under 15, or over 45; or * They have no peripheral pulse; or * Their mental status is age-inappropriate  Mental status is assessed using the AVPU scale. Age-inappropriate mental statuses include inappropriate responses to pain or unresponsiveness  Age-inappropriate mental status also includes posturing To be triaged yellow, the child must: * Have a respiratory rate between 15 and 45; and * Have a palpable peripheral pulse; and * Have an age-appropriate mental status (A, V, or P on the AVPU scale) Literature review As of 2016, there have been no studies of JumpSTART's validity or reliability in actual mass-casualty settings, though JumpSTART's discriminant validity has been established. Within the medical literature, the existing studies of JumpSTART generally examine its use in training or simulated MCI settings. Several studies have found that medical providers easily learn the JumpSTART algorithm. For example, a study of prehospital and nursing personnel found that participants showed improvements in their ability to triage pediatric patients which were maintained over a 3-month period after training ceased. Similarly, a 2013 study found that medical residents in all postgraduate years easily learned the JumpSTART algorithm, with high inter-rater reliability in individual patient triage decisions. However, while reliability was high in patients with head injuries, it was low in ambulatory patients. In a simulated pediatric mass casualty incident, JumpSTART was found to perform equally as well as SALT triage, which has been proposed as a new national standard for mass-casualty triage. However, JumpSTART was significantly faster than SALT, requiring eight seconds less per patient. However, a 2006 study by two physicians in a South African emergency department was critical of the JumpSTART system. The study examined how four different tools would have performed if used to triage pediatric patients that presented at the authors' emergency department. The authors compared the START and JumpSTART systems with two other pediatric triage tools: the Pediatric Triage Tape and Care Flight. The study reported: > None of the tools showed high sensitivity and specificity. ... [T]he > JumpSTART and START scores had very low sensitivities, which meant that they > failed to identify patients with serious injury, and would have missed the > majority of seriously injured casualties in the models of major incidents. Further study is needed to evaluate JumpSTART's validity and reliability, particularly in real-life patient settings.

Galbraith, first published in 2008. The title refers to how in US society, as Galbraith sees it, public institutions have been subverted to serve private profit: the \\"predators\\" being corporate elites. He argues that these corporate interests run the state \\"not for any ideological project‚Äîbut simply in a way that would bring to them, individually and as a group, the most money.‚Äù  Background  James Galbraith Galbraith was teaching economics at the University of Texas at Austin at the time of the book's creation. His previous book as author was Created Unequal: The Crisis in American Pay, published in 1998. In April 2006 the author visited his father, John Kenneth Galbraith, who had had a decorated career as an economist, public official and ambassador. In this final meeting before his death, the elder Galbraith suggested that James write a book about \\"corporate predation\\". The book was written in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina's devastation of New Orleans, but before the 2008 financial crash. Galbraith related both events to the ideas described in the book. For him, the Katrina disaster was a defining failure of the political system, since a political hostility to the public sector had inspired the degradation (or selling off) of publicly owned emergency services. Writing a preface for the paperback edition, which came out after the 2008 crash, Galbraith blamed the ongoing crisis on deregulation which, in the name of free markets, had left the financial predators to police themselves.  Content  The book has three sections. The first portrays free markets as a cultural myth which is not really believed by its proponents. The second explains the operation of the predator state, where economic inequality is not a side-effect of economic development but a consequence of greedy private interests taking more for themselves. The third has some recommendations for dealing with predators; getting the benefits of private enterprise without giving excessive power to corporate elites. In countering the belief that free markets will always produce the economically best outcomes, Galbraith disputes the narrative of US economic history that goes with it. While that narrative credits US prosperity to enterprise breaking free from regulation, he credits it to public institutions created in the New Deal, including social security and Medicare. The book criticises American conservatives who advocate small-government policies while, in practice, expanding government spending and pursuing \\"free trade agreements\\" that undermine free trade. It also criticises liberals for unquestioningly taking on free-market principles such as balanced budgets and government non-intervention. Galbraith describes the goal of the book as \\"to free up the liberal mind\\". As Galbraith explains it, the labels of \\"conservative\\" or \\"liberal\\" are unhelpful, as is the supposed tension between the politics of small government and big government. He sees the contest as between the super-rich predators and the rest of society. The predators demand privatization when the economy is doing well, so they can acquire assets, but in hard times, predators cast themselves as too big to fail and use their political power to get protection from the state, even getting government into debt to support their institutions.  Reception  Reviewing the book for the Journal of Economic Issues, L. Randall Wray describes it as \\"political economy at its best [...] equally deserving of status as a classic\\" as John Kenneth Galbraith's The New Industrial State and Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class, both of which it can be said to update. Wray praises both the prose style and the arguments themselves which \\"appear unassailable\\". In the New York Times, Roger Lowenstein praises the book's prose but disputes many of its arguments. He writes, \\"the gusto with which [Galbraith] repeatedly challenges tired conventions is refreshing\\" but \\"his prose is absolutist in proportion to the extent to which his assertions are unprovable,\\" concluding \\"It is not brilliant economics, but give him his due: He has raised trenchant questions about a system in crisis.\\" USA Today listed The Predator State among the best business books of 2008. In the Shanghai Daily, Wan Lixin writes that most books on economics and management lack true insight, but makes an exception for The Predator State, which \\"does not provide answers, nor real solutions, [but] has the potential to help you think on your own.\\" In particular, Lixin praises Galbraith for observing that standard economic concepts such as GDP growth do not take into account the interests of future generations, and hence that free markets do not plan well for future events. A review in Publishers Weekly describes the book as \\"highly readable\\" and rich in stimulating ideas, but \\"sometimes scattershot\\", with conclusions sometimes unclear or contradictory.  Editions  The book was printed in several editions through 2008 and 2009, by the Simon and Schuster imprint Free Press. The book has been published in Chinese by a Beijing-based publisher. An audiobook version, read by William Hughes, was released in 2009 and an ebook edition was published in 2014.  References   Further reading  * Friedman, Benjamin M.

He is the former spokesperson of Hong Kong Indigenous, a localist group. He advocates Hong Kong independence, and coined the slogan \\"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\\" during the 2016 by-election, which was later widely used in 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. Leung contested the 2016 New Territories East Legislative Council by-election, representing Hong Kong Indigenous. In February 2016, he was arrested in the Mong Kok civil unrest, but despite that his popularity rose. In the election, he received more than 66,000 votes, around 15 per cent of total votes. This led the Hong Kong government to require future candidates a written declaration to confirm their political stance. Leung signed the declaration, giving up his pro-independence stance in 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election in September. He was barred from running the election because the electoral officer was not convinced by his declaration. In December 2017, he resigned from his position as spokesperson of Hong Kong Indigenous. In the same year, Lost in the Fumes, an award-winning documentary based on his story, was released. In June 2018, he was convicted of rioting and assaulting a police officer during the Mong Kok unrest and sentenced to jail for six years. In 2019, jury reached the verdict of not guilty in his accused rioting in Portland Street, Mong Kok. In 2019, Leung was recognised by Time magazine on its \\"100 Next\\", a list of rising stars expected to shape the future. The magazine called him a spiritual leader of the 2019 Hong Kong protests, which is a leaderless movement.  Early life  Edward Leung was born into a wealthy family in Wuhan, Hubei, China. He moved to Hong Kong at the age of one with his mother. His great- grandfather was killed by the Communist Party of China and his properties were confiscated. Leung's grandfather studied in British Hong Kong, later returned to Shanghai to study Economic Management at Shanghai Institute of Finance and Economics (now Shanghai University of Finance and Economics). In 1953, Leung's grandfather graduated from the university, and was allocated to work in Xinjiang Province Bureau of Mine for seven years, later resided in Zhuhai. In 1979, the rehabilitation policy after Cultural Revolution returned the previously confiscated properties to Leung's family. In Summer 1990, Leung's father met his wife in Wuhan, the couple registered in Wuhan and Leung's mother resigned her job shortly after. On 2 June 1991, Leung was born in Hubei Province. In the following year, Leung followed his mother to reside in Hong Kong. In 2000, Leung's parents invested in restaurants in Wuhan, but took a loss due to SARS and Avian Influenza. Leung's father was a college teacher with expertise in Chinese History, Chinese Language and Buddhism. He has a strong interest in contemporary Chinese history and always teaches Leung histories of Hong Kong and World History. Leung's mother worked as a housewife after moving to Hong Kong and later worked as a tutor, teaching Leung literacy.  Social movement  When Leung was young, he questioned the rationale behind political events such as the Handover of Hong Kong in 1997 and the yearly Hong Kong 1st July marches in 2003. His parents were excited with these events and explained to Leung about their meanings. He completed his college studies at Shung Tak Catholic English College in Yuen Long District. In 2008, aged 17, for the first time he participated in memorials for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and 1 July marches. He then realised Hong Kong people protest to pursuit democracy and felt touched with their passion to preserve the truth of history. In the same year, Leung started to participate in various social movements, and felt proud of driving the society forward. He studied at the University of Hong Kong, majoring in Philosophy with a minor in Politics and Public Administration, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 2016. He felt disappointed with the Hong Kong government ignoring the will of people, forcibly passing the Express Rail Grant and postponing the implementation of dual universal suffrage. He was a member of Ricci Hall, HKU and led its development actively. In his third year, he was elected as the president of Ricci Hall Student Association, HKU, and led the Hall to win HKU Sports Championship ‚îÄ‚îÄMalayan Cup. In Summer 2014, People's Republic of China has passed the \\"831 decision\\" and White paper, this led him to believe that the HKSAR government had decided to ignore the promise made in Sino-British Joint Declaration. In September 2014, Umbrella Revolution erupted, besides part-timing in an art gallery and studying, Leung spent most of his time joining the movement. On 30 November, Leung and a group of protesters occupied the Central Government Complex, in response to the call from Hong Kong Federation of Students and Scholarism. After facing clearance from Hong Kong Police Special Tactical Squad, he believed occupational movements could not lead to changes. His graduation was delayed to 2016.  Political involvement  In 2015, Localist groups Hong Kong Indigenous was founded, to support street hawkers near districts of Sham Shui Po and Mong Kok. In March 2015, under the referral from his classmate, Leung met Ray Wong, another political activist, but was unable to join Hong Kong Indigenous. Based on their common ideology, Leung was invited to be the spokesperson of the aforementioned group. Leung and Wong founded \\"Channel i\\" on October of the same year, acting as shareholder and CEO. = 2016 New Territories East by- election and Mong Kok unrest = In December 2015, Leung decided to participate 2016 New Territories East by-election, with the aim of promoting Localism ideology, testing his approval rate, and encouraging young politicians. On 15 January 2016, Leung was nominated to represent Hong Kong Indigenous to run for New Territories East by-election, and was endorsed by Youngspiration, another localist group. But the public was not confident that Leung would have enough votes to even retrieve election deposit. Leung organized a small election parade in Sheung Shui, to explain the social problems brought by parallel importers, and was not interfered by the police. In February 2016, two street vendors were arrested. At 8pm on 8 February, Food and Environmental Hygiene Department officers attempted to drive away street vendors in Mong Kok, Leung and Hong Kong Indigenous members assisted vendors to move to Portland Street, while calling help from social network to protect vendors, the solidarity at midnight elevated to civil unrest between protesters and the police. In order to protect the protesters, Leung announced election parade during the riot and refused to leave. People gathered at Mong Kok streets and committed arson at Nathan Road, confronting riot police. Leung and 20 other Hong Kong Indigenous members were later arrested by police at Mong Kok. However, Leung received supports from other political organizations and activists such as Youngspiration, Civic Passion, LegCo councilor Wong Yuk- man, Chin Wan. They helped Leung to set up street election stations, while comparatively, Electoral Affairs Commission claims that wordings such as \\"Autonomy\\", 'Independence\\" violated Hong Kong Basic Law, and refused to mail Leung's promotional letter. On 28th February, Leung lost the by-election with 66,524 votes(15.3%), behind Alvin Yeung (160,880 votes) and Holden Chow (150,329 votes). = Barred from running in 2016 Legislative Council election = After the by-election, Leung decided to participate in the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election. At that time, Leung and Ray Wong were invited to join InterEthnic InterFaith Leadership Conference in Dharamshala, India, organized by 14th Dalai Lama. Leung and Dalai Lama held a meeting at Jokhang for two hours, the latter encourage Hong Kong people to presevere. In July 2016, Electoral Affairs Commission released new election measures, directed against activists with Hong Kong Independence stance, requiring all candidates to sign declarations to confirm their support to Basic Law, and Hong Kong is an inseparable part of China as stated in the Basic Law. Leung applied to elect for New Territory East District, and initially refused to sign the declaration and asked for Judicial review. On 22 July, Leung received an email from Electoral Affairs Commission, asking clarification on Leung's pro- Independence political stance. For this, Leung and Avery Ng sought judicial review with the High Court, claiming Electoral Affairs Commission has acted in excess of their authority, criticizing HKSAR Government's political censorship. However, the judges ruled that there was no urgency before the end of nomination and refused to approve judicial review immediately. Leung eventually decided to sign the declaration, claiming to support the Hong Kong Basic Law and declaring loyalty to HKSAR, and no longer advocating independence. In the end, six allegedly pro-independence nominees, including Leung and Hong Kong National Party convener Chan Ho-tin, were disqualified by the committee, the reason being the returning officer refused to believe their claims were genuine. On 5 August, Leung and 2,500 pro-independence supporters rallied, claiming it was the first rally supporting Hong Kong Independence.  Aftermath  In August 2016, Leung uploaded a video on Facebook, claiming he had been tracked for a month. Facebook quickly deleted the video and barred Leung's account from posting for 24 hours when Leung attempted to re-upload it. On 15 August, Leung was stalked by Ta Kung Pao reporters. Leung photographed the stalker and conflict occurred in Tai Koo Station, police arrived and filed the case as dispute, later changed to public fighting because the stalker claimed that Leung had assaulted him. Meanwhile, Ta Kung Pao continuously dug information on Leung's background, including his birthplace and ancestry. In September, Leung and Ray Wong participated in Seventh International Conference of Tibet Support Groups, organized in Brussels, Belgium. Leung revealed he would submit an Election petition when the election results were published on Hong Kong Government Gazette, On 7 October, Leung submitted the Election petition on his disqualification. On the other hand, Leung was charged of rioting and inciting riot after the Mong Kok civil unrest. On 18 December 2017, Hong Kong Indigenous issued a statement, announcing Leung has resigned his membership and spokesperson duty. = Imprisonment = On 18 January 2018, Leung and five other protesters were called in court on riot charges, Leung and Ray Wong were also charged with inciting riots between 8th to 9th February 2016 at Portland Street, Mong Kok, and police assault charges. On 22 January 2018, Leung pleaded guilty of assault charges, but denied rioting and inciting riot. He was instantly remanded in custody. On 18 May, 9 jurors reached a unanimous verdict that Leung was guilty of rioting and assault charges, but was acquitted on inciting riots. He was later sentenced to 6 years in prison. It is believed that Leung's lengthy sentence was intended to intimidate activists and squelch political protest. On 5 March 2020, local media reported that Leung had been transferred to a maximum-security prison. = Appeal = During the jail time, Leung appealed his charges and sentence, and applied for legal aid and studied a Bachelor of Social Science in Open University of Hong Kong. He is expected to be discharged in January 2022. Leung's case judgement was rescinded in March 2019, jurors ruled with 7:2 ratio that Leung was not guilty with rioting. Meanwhile, senators from 11 countries across Europe,America and Asia issued a joint statement, stating their concern over HKSAR Government abusing obsolete colonial-era Public Order Ordinance arresting and charging protesters indiscriminately in order to silence opposite voices, and request to revise the ordinance. Leung pledged a crowdfunding for his appeal on 9 October 2019, and received over 450,000 Hong Kong dollars in 15 minutes. On 29 April 2020, Leung lost an appeal against his six-year jail term.  Political stance  Leung was educated in Hong Kong. This has shaped his values and deep passions to Hong Kong. He was also inspired by The Social Contract by French thinker, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Hong Kong City-state by Chin Wan. Leung has identified himself as a radical localist loyal to Hong Kong, promoting localism, and openly support, advocate Hong Kong Independence. He refused to identify himself as a Chinese, asserting Hong Kong's ability to be independent, and is an inevitable trend. Leung initially wanted to incorporate localism ideology into mainstream political agenda, and provide the rights for Hong Kong people to determine their future. He believed his by-election approval rate is an alarm to the government. Another main goal is to de- colonize Hong Kong.. Leung also believes that the core values and systems of Hong Kong are slowly corroded by China and anyone can be considered Hong Kong people if he or she is willing to defend Hong Kong's core values, respect Hong Kong culture, and willing to merge and maintain Hong Kong's codes and systems. He also believes localism supporters need a councilor to represent their wills. In accordance with Hong Kong Indigenous's theme \\"Valiant\\", Leung believes Valiant is a mindset instead of behaviour, also agreeing sometimes it could be associated to violence. However, he agrees more aggressive ways are required to counter the government's unfair, corrupted system, even at the cost of sacrificing one's life. He also mentioned \\"no bottom line\\" does not necessarily mean at all costs. In 2015, Leung and Ray Wong advocated protesters to use Black bloc strategy to protect each other, yet he did not deny the actions of throwing rocks and arson, during Monk Kok civil unrest. After his disqualification, he believes revolution is the only way out. He also mentioned that to confront an evil government, actions should not be confined with \\"no violence\\", everything must be done to counter suppression. He expects Hong Kong revolution will require at least 16 years to succeed. In 2017, Leung decided to temporarily halt pushing independence. In 2018, Leung revealed his wish for Localist and Democrats to reach a consensus, resolve differences and stand united against the government. In 2019, Leung wrote an open letter to support Anti-extradition bill protesters, but also implored protesters not to risk their lives and be dominated by hatred.  Influences  Edward Leung is a protester after the Umbrella Revolution. Hong Kong Indigenous approves Leung's successful effort to incorporate localism into mainstream political stage During the 2016 by-election, compared to other candidates who condemned protesters' violence, Leung was able to garner votes from more radical voters, raising his fame and ultimately his final number of votes had exceeded the expectations of many.. This was widely seen as signifying the rise of localism and a strong inspiration in the upcoming Legislative Council election. Leung also claimed that, after the by-election, localism effectively became the third power in Hong Kong Politics, alongside with Pro-democracy groups and Pro-beijing groups. Leung's candidature for the Legco election triggered polar reactions. Also, the HKSAR government, just before the nomination period ended, abruptly requested candidate to sign confirmation, declaring support to Hong Kong Basic Law and promise loyalty to HKSAR. This led to Leung's disqualification. Later Leung was sentenced to 6 years in prison due to participation in the 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest. Tai Kung Pao once commented on Leung's clear mind, quick response, and excellent communication skills, believing HKSAR Government need to treat the by-election results seriously. Former Chief Executive of Hong Kong Leung Chun-Ying criticized Leung's behaviour. Since Leung was born in China, he was once accused of improvising his localist stance. His life and political career were documented in the film Lost in the Fumes in 2017, an award-winning biographical documentary by Nora Lam. However, no mainstream cinema in Hong Kong was willing to screen the film, renewing fears about self-censorship and suppress of freedom of speech. In November 2019, Leung was nominated by TIME on its \\"100 Next\\" as one of the top 100 rising stars predicted to shape the world's future. TIME commented that although Leung has been jailed since 2016, Anti-extradition Bill protesters treated him as a spiritual leader. \\"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\\" slogan was widely used and Lost in the fumes was a highly successful political documentary. The late businessman Stanley Ho and Leung are both HKU alumni. On 27 May 2020, HKU uploaded several group photographs, dated on 18 February 2014 at Ricci Hall 85th Anniversary with other alumni to show condolences, but Leung's part was found to be intentionally scrapped. This was widely condemned as self-censorship and wiping history in order to be \\"politically correct\\". HKU responded that their intention was to make the main character Stanley Ho stand out from the crowd. However, by cutting Leung away, Stanley Ho's lower body was scrapped and he was not centered in the picture anymore. After wide criticization, HKU replaced with the original photograph after two hours.

As a two-year-old in 1990 he was one of the best staying colts of his generation in Britain, winning all three of his races including the Somerville Tattersall Stakes and the Racing Post Trophy. He did not fulfil his early promise, failing to win a race in the next two seasons before winning twice as a five-year-old in 1993. He was later transferred to race in the United States and subsequently relocated to South Africa but had no further success before being retired from racing at the age of seven. Background Peter Davies was a chestnut horse with a white blaze and four long white socks bred in Kentucky at Pamela H Firman's Whileaway Farm. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Bering, who won the Prix du Jockey Club and finished second to Dancing Brave in the 1986 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. As a breeding stallion, the best of his offspring included Pennekamp, American Post, Glorosia and Matiara (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches). Peter Davies' dam French Flick was a successful racemare who won five of her thirty-three races between 1981 and 1983. She was a great-granddaughter of Lea Lark, an American broodmare whose other descendants have included Tobougg, Miswaki, Almutawakel, Southern Halo and White Muzzle. As a yearling in September 1990, the colt was offered for sale at Keeneland and was bought for $20,000 by Jackie Ramos. Peter Davies auction history He entered the ownership of Charles St George and was sent to Europe where he entered training with Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1990: two-year-old season= Peter Davies began his racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at Leicester Racecourse on 11 September and started at odds of 5/1 in a twelve-runner field. Ridden as in all his races that year by Steve Cauthen he led from the start, accelerated approaching the final furlong and won \\"easily\\" by four lengths. He was then moved up in class for the Somerville Tattersall Stakes over the same distance at Newmarket Racecourse in which he was matched against Bog Trotter, the winner of the Champagne Stakes. After racing in second place behind the outsider Regal Crest, he went to the front a furlong out and won by two lengths from Bog Trotter. The Racing Post Trophy over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse on 27 October saw Peter Davies stepping up to Group One level and starting the 2/1 joint favourite alongside Mujaazif, the Michael Stoute-trained winner of the Royal Lodge Stakes. The only other two runners were the Vintage Stakes winner Mukaddamah and the Barry Hills-trained Marcham, the winner of his only previous start. After leading from the start, Peter Davies was overtaken by Mukaddamah two furlongs out, but rallied strongly in the closing stages, regained the advantage in the final stride and won by a short head. Marcham was four lengths back in third whilst Mujaazif finished tailed off. =1991: three-year-old season= In the spring of 1991, Peter Davies was regarded as a serious contender for the Derby Stakes and began his season in the Dante Stakes (a major trial for the Epsom classic) over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse. Ridden by Lester Piggott he started favourite and led from the start, but after being overtaken three furlongs from the finish he dropped back quickly and finished seventh of the eight runners behind Environment Friend. After a break of four months he returned in a minor race over one mile at Newbury Racecourse in September. He took the lead in the last quarter mile but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished fourth. =1992: four- year-old season= As a four-year-old Peter Davies was trained by Andr√© Fabre and campaigned in France but made no impact, finishing unplaced in his two starts. He ran down the field in the Prix Exbury at Saint-Cloud Racecourse in March and a minor race at Maisons-Laffitte in May. On 30 November 1992 the colt was put up for auction at the Tattersalls sale but was not sold as he failed to reach his reserve price of 50,000 guineas. He was later transferred to the ownership of Charles St George's brother Edward, who raced the colt in the name of his Lucayan Stud. =1993: five-year-old season= David Loder took over as Peter Davies' trainer for the 1993 season. He began the season by finishing second in a minor race at York after which Frankie Dettori took over as his jockey. On 3 June he started at odds of 3/1 for a race over eight and a half furlongs at Epsom Downs Racecourse and recorded his first success for well over two and a half years as he won by a head from the four-year-old Powerful Edge. A month later he won again, carrying top weight of 133 pounds to a two-length victory in a handicap race over one mile at Sandown Park Racecourse. On his final European appearance he carried 139 pounds in a valuable handicap at Goodwood Racecourse and started favourite but finished eighteenth of the nineteen runners. Commenting on the poor run, Loder said \\"I've asked the horse to explain himself but he's not saying anything\\". In August, Peter Davies was sent to Chicago to contest the Grade I Arlington Million and finished fifth behind Star of Cozzene. He remained in the United States and finished sixth in an allowance race at Arlington in September before joining the stable of Ron McAnally. On his only other run of the year he finished last of six in an allowance at Hollywood Park Racetrack in December. =1994 & 1995: later racing career= In the early part of 1994, Peter Davies was unplaced in two allowance races at Santa Anita Park and was off the course for the rest of the year. As a seven-year-old in 1995 he was moved to South Africa and reportedly finished third once and unplaced twice. Stud record Peter Davies retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in South Africa: he had no success as a sire of racehorses but reportedly sired some good show jumpers. His last reported foals were born in 2011.

It was started in 2013 as a subsidiary of the private intelligence company and self- described \\"global election management agency\\" SCL Group by long-time SCL executives Nigel Oakes, Alexander Nix and Alexander Oakes, with Nix as CEO. The company had close ties to the Conservative Party (UK), the British royal family and the British military. The firm maintained offices in London, New York City, and Washington, DC. The company closed operations in 2018 in the course of the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal, although related firms still exist. The company's owners included several of the Conservative Party's largest donors such as billionaire Vincent Tchenguiz, former British Conservative minister Jonathan Marland, Baron Marland and the family of American hedge fund manager Robert Mercer. The company combined misappropriation of digital assets, data mining, data brokerage, and data analysis with strategic communication during electoral processes. While its parent SCL had focused on influencing elections in developing countries since the 1990s, Cambridge focused more on the western world including the U.K. and the U.S.; CEO Alexander Nix has said CA was involved in 44 U.S. political races in 2014. In 2015, CA performed data analysis services for Ted Cruz's presidential campaign. In 2016, CA worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign as well as for Leave.EU (one of the organisations campaigning in the United Kingdom's referendum on European Union membership). CA's role in those campaigns has been controversial and is the subject of ongoing inquiries in both countries. Political scientists question CA's claims about the effectiveness of its methods of targeting voters. In March 2018, multiple media outlets broke news of Cambridge Analytica's business practices. The New York Times and The Observer reported that the company had acquired and used personal data about Facebook users from an external researcher who had told Facebook he was collecting it for academic purposes. Shortly afterwards, Channel 4 News aired undercover investigative videos showing Nix boasting about using prostitutes, bribery sting operations, and honey traps to discredit politicians on whom it conducted opposition research, and saying that the company \\"ran all of (Donald Trump's) digital campaign\\". In response to the media reports, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) of the UK pursued a warrant to search the company's servers. Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica from advertising on its platform, saying that it had been deceived. On 23 March 2018, the British High Court granted the ICO a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's London offices. As a result, Nix was suspended as CEO, and replaced by Julian Wheatland. The personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users were acquired via the 270,000 Facebook users who used a Facebook app called \\"This Is Your Digital Life.\\" By giving this third-party app permission to acquire their data, back in 2015, this also gave the app access to information on the user's friends network; this resulted in the data of about 87 million users, the majority of whom had not explicitly given Cambridge Analytica permission to access their data, being collected. The app developer breached Facebook's terms of service by giving the data to Cambridge Analytica. On 1 May 2018, Cambridge Analytica and its parent company filed for insolvency proceedings and closed operations. Alexander Tayler, a former director for Cambridge Analytica, was appointed director of Emerdata on 28 March 2018. Rebekah Mercer, Jennifer Mercer, Alexander Nix and , who has links to American businessman Erik Prince, are in leadership positions at Emerdata. The Russo brothers are producing an upcoming film on Cambridge Analytica. In 2019 the Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against Cambridge Analytica for misuse of data.Cambridge Analytica, LLC, In the Matter of, Federal Trade Commission In 2020, the British Information Commissioner's Office closed a three-year inquiry into the company, concluded that Cambridge Analytica was \\"not involved\\" in the 2016 Brexit referendum and found no evidence for Russia's alleged interference during the campaign. History Cambridge Analytica was established as a subsidiary of the private intelligence company SCL Group that was active in military and political arenas. The men who ran Cambridge Analytica and its parent SCL were described as having close ties to the Conservative Party (UK), royalty and the British military. Cambridge Analytica (SCL USA) was incorporated in January 2015 with its registered office in Westferry Circus, London and just one staff member, its director and CEO Alexander James Ashburner Nix (also appointed in January 2015). Nix was also the director of nine similar companies sharing the same registered offices in London, including Firecrest technologies, Emerdata and six SCL Group companies including \\"SCL elections limited\\". Nigel Oakes, known as the former boyfriend of Lady Helen Windsor, had founded the predecessor SCL Group in the 1990s, and in 2005 Oakes established SCL Group together with his brother Alexander Oakes and Alexander Nix; SCL Group was the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. Conservative minister and MP Sir Geoffrey Pattie was the founding chairman of SCL; Lord Ivar Mountbatten also joined Oakes as a director of the company. As a result of the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal Nix was removed as CEO and replaced by Julian Wheatland before the company closed. Several of the company's executives were Old Etonians. Publicly, parent company SCL Group called itself a \\"global election management agency\\", Politico reported it was known for involvement \\"in military disinformation campaigns to social media branding and voter targeting\\". SCL gained work on a large number of campaigns for the US and UK governments' War on Terror advancing their model of behavioral conflict during the 2000s.[Briant, Emma (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester: Manchester University Press.] SCL's involvement in the political world has been primarily in the developing world where it has been used by the military and politicians to study and manipulate public opinion and political will. Slate writer Sharon Weinberger compared one of SCL's hypothetical test scenarios to fomenting a coup. Among the investors in Cambridge Analytica were some of the Conservative Party's largest donors such as billionaire Vincent Tchenguiz, former Conservative minister Jonathan Marland, Baron Marland, Roger Gabb, the family of American hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, and Steve Bannon. A minimum of 15 million dollars has been invested into the company by Mercer, according to The New York Times. Bannon's stake in the company was estimated at 1 to 5 million dollars, but he divested his holdings in April 2017 as required by his role as White House Chief Strategist. In March 2018, Jennifer Mercer and Rebekah Mercer became directors of Emerdata limited. In March 2018 it became public by Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, that Cambridge Analytica's first activities were founded on a data set, which its parent company SCL bought 2014 from a company named Global Science Research founded by Aleksandr Kogan and his team present across the world Hannes Grassegger und Mikael Krogerus, in: Tages-Anzeiger: ¬´Ich habe nur gezeigt, dass es die Bombe gibt¬ª (I only showed, that there is a bomb), 3. 20th 2018 who worked as a psychologist at Cambridge. Dr Emma Briant published evidence through the British Parliament's Fake News Inquiry indicating that Cambridge Analytica did work for the UK's LeaveEU Brexit campaign during the 2016 EU Referendum which they denied. The Information Commissioners Office in February 2019 decided to audit the campaign, and its funder Arron Banks company Eldon Insurance for unlawful marketing involving repurposing of data. During Boris Johnson's tenure as foreign secretary, the Foreign Office sought advice from Cambridge Analytica and Boris Johnson had a meeting with Alexander Nix in 2016. =Aftermath= Following the downfall of Cambridge Analytica, a number of companies have been established by executives who had also been involved with Cambridge Analytica. In July 2018, several former Cambridge Analytica staff launched Auspex International, a company intended to influence politics and society in Africa and the Middle East; another company called Emerdata also had substantial overlap with Cambridge Analytica.https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3035777/cambridge- analyticas-latest-wants-your-google-search-history According to the Associated Press, Data Propria, a data analysis firm launched May 2018, is run by former officials at Cambridge Analytica. Methods CA's data analysis methods were to a large degree based on the academic work of Michal Kosinski. In 2008, Kosinski had joined the Psychometrics Centre of Cambridge University where he then developed with his colleagues a profiling system using general online data, Facebook-likes, and smartphone data. He showed that with a limited number of \\"likes\\", people can be analysed better than friends or relatives can do and that individual psychological targeting is a powerful tool to influence people. CA would collect data on voters using sources such as demographics, consumer behaviour, internet activity, and other public and private sources. According to The Guardian, CA used psychological data derived from millions of Facebook users, largely without users' permission or knowledge. Another source of information was the \\"Cruz Crew\\" mobile app that tracked physical movements and contacts and according to the Associated Press, invaded personal data more than previous presidential campaign apps. Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix speaking in November 2017. The company claimed to use \\"data enhancement and audience segmentation techniques\\" providing \\"psychographic analysis\\" for a \\"deeper knowledge of the target audience\\". The company uses the Big Five model of personality Using what it calls \\"behavioral microtargeting\\" the company indicates that it can predict \\"needs\\" of subjects and how these needs may change over time. Services then can be individually targeted for the benefit of its clients from the political arena, governments, and companies providing \\"a better and more actionable view of their key audiences.\\" According to Sasha Issenberg, CA indicates that it can tell things about an individual he might not even know about himself. CA derived much of its personality data on online surveys which it conducts on an ongoing basis. For each political client, the firm would narrow voter segments from 32 different personality styles it attributes to every adult in the United States. The personality data would inform the tone of the language used in ad messages or voter contact scripts, while additional data is used to determine voters' stances on particular issues. The data would get updated with monthly surveys, asking about political preferences and how people get the information they use to make decisions. It also covered consumer topics about different brands and preferred products, building up an image of how someone shops as much as how they vote. =Channel 4 News investigation= Channel 4 News, a news programme broadcast by the British public service Channel 4, conducted a four-month investigation into Cambridge Analytica starting in November 2017. An undercover reporter posed as a potential customer for Cambridge Analytica, hoping to help Sri Lankan candidates get elected. Video footage from this operation was published on 19 March 2018. From the footage, Cambridge Analytica executives say they worked on over 200 elections across the world. Alexander Nix was recorded in this investigation, talking \\"unguardedly about the company's practices\\". Nix said that his company uses honey traps, bribery stings, and prostitutes, for opposition research. For example, Nix offered to discredit political opponents in Sri Lanka with suggestive videos using \\"beautiful Ukrainian girls\\" and offers of bribes, even if the opponents did not accept the offers. He also said he uses \\"Israeli companies\\" to entrap political opponents with bribes and sex, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that it was referring to Psy-Group. Zamel signed a memorandum of understanding for Psy-Group with Cambridge Analytica on 14 December 2016. Cambridge Analytica said that the video footage was \\"edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent\\" the recorded conversations and company's business practices. Nix said that he had \\"entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios\\", but insisted his company does not engage in entrapment or bribery. In the third part of the series, Nix also said that Cambridge Analytica \\"ran all the digital campaign\\" for Trump. Nix stated they used communications that would be self-destructive, leaving no incriminating evidence. After the news segment was broadcast, the board of Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix as chief executive officer, and Julian Wheatland became the new CEO. The company also released a statement that the allegations did not represent the ethics of the company, and an independent entity would investigate Nix's statements. The investigation also raised questions regarding campaign finance law. During the 2016 election, the company was employed both by Trump's campaign and Robert Mercer's Make America Number 1 Super PAC which supported Trump. While PACs are not limited in the amount of funds they can spend on behalf of a candidate, they are not allowed to coordinate strategy with the campaigns they are supporting. Nix's statements in the recorded video describe how the Trump campaign itself could \\"take the high road\\" and \\"stay clean\\", while the negative attacks were handled by the firm and the Super PAC, in a way which makes it \\"unattributable, untrackable\\". These statements potentially suggested unlawful coordination between Trump's campaign and the PAC, although Cambridge Analytica has denied this. =Assessment of impact= Canadian whistleblower Christopher Wylie who was the former director of research at Cambridge Analytica Some political scientists have been skeptical of claims made by Cambridge Analytica about the effectiveness of its microtargeting of voters. They believe that access to digital data doesn't provide significantly more information than from public voter databases, and the digital data has limited value over time as the preferences of voters change. While studies have shown that personality does impact political preferences, some political scientists still believe that it is hard to infer political values from personality traits. Research discussed by Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College showed that it is extremely hard to alter voters' preferences because many likely voters are already committed partisans; as a result, it is easier to simply mobilize partisan voters. Tufts University political scientist Eitan Hersh, who has published on microtargeting in campaigns, has expressed strong skepticism about Cambridge Analytica's methods and their purported effectiveness, saying \\"Every claim about psychographics etc made by or about [Cambridge Analytica] is BS.\\" In 2017, CA claimed that it has psychological profiles of 220 million US citizens based on 5,000 separate data sets. In March 2017, The New York Times reported that CA had exaggerated its capabilities: \\"Cambridge executives now concede that the company never used psychographics in the Trump campaign.\\" Trump aides have also disputed CA's role in the campaign, describing it as \\"modest\\" and noting that none of the company's efforts involved psychographics. According to an aide and consultant for Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, their campaign stopped using CA after its psychographic models failed to identify likely Cruz supporters. The Cruz campaign ceased access to all of Cambridge's data after the South Carolina Republican primary on 20 February 2016 when Cruz came in third after Trump and Rubio. =Privacy issues and investigations= The use of personal data collected without knowledge or permission to establish sophisticated models of user's personalities raises ethical and privacy issues. CA operated out of the United States; its operations would be illegal in Europe with its stricter privacy laws. While Cruz was outspoken about protecting personal information from the government, his database of CA has been described as \\"political-voter surveillance\\". Regarding CA's use of Facebook users, a speaker for CA indicated that these users gave permission when signing up with the provider, while Facebook declared that \\"misleading people or misusing information\\" is in violation of Facebook's policies. In 2015, Facebook indicated that it was investigating the matter. In March 2018, Facebook announced that it had suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories for failing to delete data on Facebook users that had been improperly collected. Alexander Nix suggested that data collection and microtargeting benefits the voters ‚Äì because they receive messages about issues they care about. However, digital rights protection groups raised concerns that private information is collected, stored, and shared while individuals are \\"left in the dark about [it]\\" and have no control. Significant backlash against Facebook came to light in March 2018, resulting in controversy as well as a $37 billion drop in the market capitalization of Facebook, as of 20 March. Due to the scandal of enabling monetization of Facebook personal data, one assessment was that only 41% of Facebook users trust the company. On 26 March, the US Federal Trade Commission announced it is \\"conducting an open investigation of Facebook Inc's privacy practices following the disclosure that 50 million users' data got into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.\\" In March 2019 Facebook acknowledged it had concerns about ‚Äúimproper data-gathering practices‚Äù by CA, months before the previously reported onset-of-alert at December 2015. In December 2019 the Federal Trade Commission also filed a complaint against Cambridge Analytica for its practices, while filing settlements with CEO Alexander Nix and app developer Aleksandr Kogan. Elections = Australia = In Australia, Cambridge Analytica set up an office. Allan Lorraine, a friend of Alexander Tayler who was a former director for Cambridge Analytica and later appointed director of Emerdata, set up SCL (the parent company of Cambridge Analytica) in Australia. Representatives of Cambridge Analytica had a private dinner with Dan Tehan when he was then the minister responsible for cyber security, and Liberal party executives. The business name \\"Cambridge Analytica\\" was registered in Australia to the Lorraine Family Trust in June 2015. SCL Group, promoted Mr Lorraine online as its head of Australian operations. Alexander Nix spoke at an Australian data- driven advertising conference run by the Association for Data-driven Marketing and Advertising and met with Liberal Party officials. Cambridge Analytica was scoping both political as well as commercial work in Australia. Cambridge Analytica's managing director of political operations said in a video recorded by Channel 4 that \\"We‚Äôve done it in Mexico, we‚Äôve done it in Malaysia, we‚Äôre now moving into Brazil, Australia, China.\\" More than 310,000 Australian Facebook users were among the millions globally who may have had their information improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, to be sold and used for political profiling. =India= In India, Cambridge Analytica had been used by the Indian National Congress (INC) to carry out \\"in-depth electorate analysis\\" and influence voters, including in the 2010 elections to the Bihar Legislative Assembly. 355 Indian Facebook users installed a Cambridge Analytica app, exposing the data of 562,455 users. In addition, Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, alleged that the company had offices and staff in India, and that the INC party was a major client. A BBC documentary clip showing a poster of the INC in ex-CEO Alexander Nix's office went viral in India, sparking accusations that the company was manipulating both mainstream and social media in order to subvert Indian voters away from the Bharatiya Janata Party and towards the INC as part of a neocolonial effort to undermine Indian politics in favor of vested interests. In early 2018 Cambridge Analytica made a 50-page proposal for the INC for both the upcoming 2019 general election in India and their upcoming electoral campaign for the Indian states of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh state elections in 2018. The Indian National Congress, however, lost the elections by a sizable margin, winning not even enough seats to be the official opposition party in India. =Kenya= CA ran campaigns in secret during Kenya's 2013 and 2017 elections. In 2018, a CA employee said that his predecessor at the company had been found dead in his hotel room in Kenya while working on Uhuru Kenyatta's 2013 campaign. The company claimed on its website to have conducted a survey of 47,000 Kenyans during the 2013 elections in order to understand \\"key national and local political issues, levels of trust in key politicians, voting behaviours/intentions, and preferred information channels\\". According to verified sources, CA worked with 360 Media, a company formed by Simon Gicharu (founder of Mount Kenya University) and Tom Mshindi (Editor-in-Chief of Nation Media Group). 360 Media developed online campaigns in the 2017 Kenyan elections portraying \\"Raila Odinga as a blood-thirsty individual who is also sympathetic to Al-Shabaab and having no development agenda,\\" whilst portraying the incumbent President Kenyatta as \\"tough on terrorism, and being good for the economy.\\" After the revelations in March 2018, where CA staff boasted of their power in Kenya, opposition figures called for an investigation. Norman Magaya, an official of the National Super Alliance, accused CA and the ruling Jubilee Party of committing a crime and called for an investigation. The Jubilee Party downplayed CA's role, saying it had hired the firm's parent company, to assist with branding. =Malta= In its Disinformation and 'fake news' inquiry, published on 29 July 2018, the UK Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee noted that it is believed that CA, or its associated companies, worked with the Labour Party in Malta, on the 2013 Maltese general election campaign. Several sources claim that CA had close relationships with Henley & Partners who would immediately after the election introduce and run a lucrative Citizenship by Investment Program in Malta. The Maltese Government issued a press release denying the claims and calling the report and its sources \\"fake news\\". Henley & Partners denied any wrongdoing. According to Henley & Partners, there was never a formal working relationship with CA. The Final Report by the UK Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, published on 18 February 2019, took note of the Maltese Government's submissions (including through PR agency Chelgate's services) but determined that compelling evidence shown to the Committee confirmed that: \\"SCL certainly had meetings in Malta, that Christian Kalin of Henley & Partners was introduced by SCL to Joseph Muscat in 2011, and that Christian Kalin met with both political parties before 2013\\". The Maltese Government later issued a further denial decrying the use of \\"unnamed sources\\" and \\"confidential documents\\". =Mexico= After the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal, Forbes published that the British news program Channel 4 News had mentioned the existence of proof revealing ties between the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Cambridge Analytica, suggesting a modus operandi similar to the one in the United States. According to Channel 4 News' Guillermo Galdos, CA worked for the PRI at least until January 2018. An investigation was requested. In 2017 the company had reached out to the PRI, Mexico's ruling political party, in order to bolster the party's presidential campaign during the largest-ever political elections of 2018. The party decided that it was sufficiently equipped to mess with the election on its own, but still paid Cambridge Analytica to prevent it from working with rival parties. =United Kingdom= A protest following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, 29 March 2018 Many donors to the UK Conservative Party reportedly have connections to the parent company of Cambridge Analytica.Tory donors among investors in Cambridge Analytica parent firm The Guardian CA became involved in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum (Brexit) supporting \\"persuadable\\" voters to vote for leaving the European Union (EU). Articles by Carole Cadwalladr in The Observer and Guardian newspapers, respectively published in February and May 2017, speculated in detail that CA had influenced both the Brexit/Vote Leave option in the UK's 2016 EU membership referendum and Trump's 2016 US presidential campaign with Robert Mercer's backing of Donald Trump being key. They also discuss the legality of using the social data farmed. CA is pursuing legal action over the claims made in Cadwalladr's articles. No campaign contributions, in cash or in kind, by Cambridge Analytica were reported to the UK electoral authorities. Both CA and Leave.EU refused to comment on any donation of services. On 23 March 2018, it was reported that a former employee, Brittany Kaiser, who was the company's former director of business development, revealed that the company misled the public and MPs over its links with Leave.EU and the analysis of data which had been provided by the UK Independence Party (UKIP). She said she felt she had lied by supporting Cambridge Analytica's company line that it had done \\"no paid or unpaid work\\" for Leave.EU. \\"In my opinion, I was lying. In my opinion I felt like we should say, 'this is exactly what we did'\\". The following day, it was reported that the company claimed that it would be able to affect the outcome of the Referendum and that it had produced a 10-page document headed \\"Big Data Solutions for the EU Referendum\\", claiming it could single out 'Brexiteers' among voters, donors, politicians and journalists. DW reported in March 2018 that \\"Whistleblower Christopher Wylie told UK lawmakers during a committee hearing on Tuesday that a firm linked to Cambridge Analytica helped the official Vote Leave campaign [the official pro- Brexit group headed by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove] circumvent campaign financing laws during the Brexit referendum.\\"\\"What role did Cambridge Analytica play in the Brexit vote?\\". Deutsche Welle. 27 March 2018. =United States= Laurence Levy, a lawyer with the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani, advises Rebekah Mercer, Steve Bannon, and Alexander Nix on the legality of their company, Cambridge Analytica, being involved in Elections in the United States. He advises that Nix and any foreign nationals without a green card working for the company must not be involved in any decision making regarding any work the company performs for any clients related to U.S. elections. He further advises Nix to recuse himself from any involvement with the company's U.S. election work because he is not a U.S. citizen. 2014 midterm elections CA had entered the US market in 2012 (or 2013), and was involved in 44 US congressional, US Senate and state-level elections in the 2014 US elections. The company worked with the John Bolton Super PAC (political action committee) on a major digital and TV campaign focused on senate races in Arkansas, North Carolina and New Hampshire and helped turn out voters for the Republican Party candidates in those states. Two of the Republican candidates backed by the Bolton Super PAC, Thom Tillis in North Carolina and Tom Cotton in Arkansas, won their Senate bids, while Scott Brown lost in New Hampshire. The PAC ran 15 different TV advertisements each in North Carolina and Arkansas and 17 in New Hampshire, mostly online with some targeted directly to households using Dish Network and DirecTV. All were intended to push Bolton's national security agenda. CA also supported Thom Tillis's successful campaign to oust Kay Hagan as a senator for North Carolina. The firm was credited for its role in identifying a sizeable cluster of North Carolinians who prioritised foreign affairs, which encouraged Tillis to shift the conversation from state-level debates over education policy to charges that incumbent Kay Hagan had failed to take ISIS's rise seriously. Tillis's campaign and the North Carolina Republican Party paid Cambridge Analytica $345,000 for these services. CA sent dozens of non-U.S. citizens to provide campaign strategy and messaging advice to Republican candidates in 2014, opening the firm and individuals to prosecution under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, for being foreign agents having not registered through the United States Department of Justice as such. 2016 presidential election CA's involvement in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries became known in July 2015. As of December 2015, CA claimed to have collected up to 5,000 data points on over 220 million Americans. At that time Robert Mercer was a major supporter of Ted Cruz. The Mercer family funded CA directly and indirectly through several super-PACs as well as through payments via Cruz's campaign. Cruz became an early major client of CA in the 2016 presidential campaign. Just prior to the Iowa Republican caucuses, the Cruz campaign had spent $3 million for CA's services, with additional money coming from allied Super-PACs. After Cruz's win at the Iowa caucus CA was credited with having been able to identify and motivate potential voters. Ultimately the Cruz campaign spent $5.8 million on work by CA. Ben Carson was a second client of CA; his campaign had paid $220,000 for \\"data management\\" and \\"web service\\" as reported in October 2015. Marco Rubio's campaign was supported by Optimus Consulting. Meanwhile, the third competitor, Governor John Kasich, was supported by rivalling firm Applecart. After Cruz dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination in May 2016, Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer started to support Trump. In August, it became known that CA followed their allegiance and worked for Trump's presidential campaign. Trump's campaign also worked with digital firm Giles Parscale. In September, the Trump campaign spent $5 million to purchase television advertising. The Trump campaign spent less than $1 million in data work. In 2016, the company said that it had not used psychographics in the Trump presidential campaign. Cambridge Analytica targeted potential voters with bespoke messages. Cambridge Analytica's data head, Alexander Tayler said, \\"When you think about the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3m votes but won the electoral college vote, [t]hat's down to the data and the research.\\"The poison in politics runs deeper than dodgy data The Guardian The head of Cambridge Analytica said he asked WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, for help finding Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails. On 18 May 2017, Time reported that the US Congress was investigating CA in connection with Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. The report alleges that CA may have coordinated the spread of Russian propaganda using its microtargetting capabilities. According to the Trump campaign's digital operations chief, CA worked \\"side-by-side\\" with representatives from Facebook, Alphabet Inc. and Twitter on Trump's digital campaign activities. On 4 August 2017, Michael Flynn, who is under investigation by US counterintelligence for his contacts with Russian officials, amended a public financial filing to reflect that he had served in an advisory role in an agreement with CA during the 2016 Trump campaign. On 8 October 2017, Brad Parscale, who was the digital media director for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, stated in an interview with Lesley Stahl from CBS News on 60 Minutes that Parscale was able to utilize Facebook advertising to directly target individual voters in swing states. Parscale cited the example in which he was able to target specific universes (audiences) who care about infrastructure and promote Trump and his message to build back up the crumbling American infrastructure. Although he hired Cambridge Analytica to assist with microtargeting, and Cambridge Analytica stated that it was the key to Trump's victory, Parscale denied that he gained assistance from the firm, stating that he thought Cambridge Analytica's use of psychographics doesn't work. He also denied any assistance with links to Russia. According to Parscale, the Clinton campaign turned down assistance from these platforms. On 25 October 2017, Assange said on Twitter that he had been approached by Cambridge Analytica, but that he had rejected its proposal. Assange's tweet followed a story in The Daily Beast alleging that Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had proposed a collaboration with Wikileaks to find the 33,000 emails that had been deleted from Clinton's private server. CNN said it had been told by several unnamed sources that Nix intended to turn the Clinton email archive released to the public by the State Department into a searchable database for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee. On 14 December 2017, it was revealed that Robert Mueller had requested during the fall of 2017 that Cambridge Analytica turn over the emails of any of its employees who worked on the Trump campaign, as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. In 2018, following disclosures that the company had improperly used the personal information of over 50 million Facebook users while working on Trump's presidential campaign, The Times of Israel reported that the company had used what Nix had called \\"intelligence gathering\\" from British and Israeli companies as part of their efforts to influence the election results in Trump's favor. =Other countries= Cambridge Analytica's executives said in 2018 that the company had worked in more than 200 elections around the world, including in India, Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia (CA's website stated that it supported Prime Minister Najib Razak's Barisan Nasional coalition), Colombia, Cyprus, Zambia, South Africa, Romania, Italy, Lithuania, Trinidad and Tobago, Nigeria (Nigeria's 2015 presidential election), the Czech Republic, and Argentina. During the investigation it was admitted that the company has been contacted from a famous Italian party to manage the electoral campaign in Italy but the name of the party was not revealed. In the Philippines, Cambridge Analytica was also involved in the 2016 presidential election with reports citing it helped Rodrigo Duterte win the race. Duterte's camp denied this association. The SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica's parent company, claimed that it rebranded the politician's image to target voters who they found are swayed by qualities such as toughness and decisiveness. During the election cycle, Facebook confirmed that its data of more 1 million Filipino users were improperly shared with the communications company. On 4 January 2020, a release of more than 100,000 documents showed how Cambridge Analytica worked in 68 countries. A global infrastructure with operations to manipulate voters on \\"an industrial scale\\". The release of documents began on New Year's Day from an anonymous Twitter account called @HindsightFiles, that published material on elections in Malaysia, Kenya and Brazil (and next days so more countries). This documents came from Brittany Kaiser, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, and were retrieved from her email accounts and hard drives.
